    "the newly born inter - disciplinar field of neutrino geoscience takes the advantage of the technologies developed by large - volume neutrino experiments and of the achievements of the elementary particle physics in order to study the earth interior with a new probe - geo - neutrinos .",
    "geo - neutrinos are electron antineutrinos released in the decays of radioactive elements with lifetimes comparable with the age of the earth and distributed through the earth s interior .",
    "the radiogenic heat released during the decays of these heat producing elements ( hpe ) is in a well fixed ratio with the total mass of hpe inside the earth .",
    "geo - neutrinos bring to the earth s surface an instant information about the distribution of hpe .",
    "thus , it is , in principle , possible to extract from measured geo - neutrino fluxes several geological information completely unreachable by other means .",
    "these information concern the total abundance and distribution of the hpe inside the earth and thus the determination of the fraction of radiogenic heat contributing to the total surface heat flux .",
    "such a knowledge is of critical importance for understanding complex processes such as the mantle convection , the plate tectonics , the geo - dynamo ( the process of generation of the earth s magnetic field ) , as well as the earth formation itself .",
    "currently , only two large - volume , liquid - scintillator neutrino experiments , kamland in japan and borexino in italy , have been able to measure the geo - neutrino signal .",
    "antineutrinos can interact only through the weak interactions .",
    "thus , the cross - section of the inverse - beta decay detection interaction @xmath0 is very low .",
    "even a typical flux of the order of @xmath1 geo - neutrinos @xmath2 s@xmath3 leads to only a hand - full number of interactions , few or few tens per year with the current - size detectors .",
    "this means , the geo - neutrino experiments must be installed in underground laboratories in order to shield the detector from cosmic radiations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to review the current status of the neutrino geoscience .",
    "first , in sec .  [ sec : geonu ] we describe the radioactive decays of hpe and the geo - neutrino production , the geo - neutrino energy spectra and the impact of the neutrino oscillation phenomenon on the geo - neutrino spectrum and flux . the sec .",
    "[ sec : earth ] is intended to give an overview of the current knowledge of the earth interior . the opened problems to which understanding the geo - neutrino studies can contribute are highlighted .",
    "section  [ sec : signal ] sheds light on how the expected geo - neutrino signal can be calculated considering different geological models .",
    "section  [ sec : experiments ] describes the kamland and the borexino detectors .",
    "section  [ sec : analysis ] describes details of the geo - neutrino analysis : from the detection principles , through the background sources to the most recent experimental results and their geological implications . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : future ] we describe the future perspectives of the field of neutrino geoscience and the projects having geo - neutrino measurement among their scientific goals .",
    "today , the earth s radiogenic heat is in almost 99% produced along with the radioactive decays in the chains of @xmath4th ( @xmath5 = 14.0 @xmath6 10@xmath7 year ) , @xmath8u ( @xmath5 = 4.47 @xmath6 10@xmath7 year ) , @xmath9u ( @xmath5 = 0.70 @xmath6 10@xmath7 year ) , and those of the @xmath10k isotope ( @xmath5 = 1.28 @xmath6 10@xmath7 year ) .",
    "the overall decay schemes and the heat released in each of these decays are summarized in the following equations :    @xmath11    @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    since the isotopic abundance of @xmath9u is small , the overall contribution of @xmath8u , @xmath4th , and @xmath10k is largely predominant .",
    "in addition , a small fraction ( less than 1% ) of the radiogenic heat is coming from the decays of @xmath16rb ( @xmath5 = 48.1 @xmath17 10@xmath7 year ) , @xmath18la ( @xmath19 10@xmath7 year ) , and @xmath20lu ( @xmath5 = 37.6 @xmath17 10@xmath7 year ) .",
    "neutron - rich nuclides like @xmath8u , @xmath4th , and @xmath9u , made up  @xcite by neutron capture reactions during the last stages of massive - stars lives , decay into the lighter and proton - richer nuclides by yielding @xmath21 and @xmath22 particles , see eqs .",
    "[ eq : geo1 ] - [ eq : geo3 ] . during @xmath23 decays , electron antineutrinos ( @xmath24 ) are emitted that carry away in the case of @xmath8u and @xmath4th chains , 8% and 6% , respectively , of the total available energy  @xcite . in the computation of the overall @xmath24 energy spectrum of each decay chain , the shapes and rates of all the individual decays has to be included : detailed calculations required to take into account up to @xmath2580 different branches for each chain  @xcite .",
    "the most important contributions to the geo - neutrino signal are however those of @xmath26bi and @xmath27pa@xmath28 in the uranium chain and @xmath29bi and @xmath30ac in the thorium chain  @xcite .",
    "geo - neutrino spectrum extends up to 3.26mev and the contributions originating from different elements can be distinguished according to their different end - points , i.e. , geo - neutrinos with e @xmath31 2.25mev are produced only in the uranium chain , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geonuspe ] .",
    "we note , that according to geo - chemical studies , @xmath4th is more abundant than @xmath8u and their mass ratio in the bulk earth is expected to be @xmath32(@xmath4th)/@xmath32(@xmath8u ) = 3.9 ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : earth ] ) . because the cross - section of the detection interaction from eq .",
    "[ eq : invbeta ] increases with energy , the ratio of the signals expected in the detector is @xmath33(@xmath4th)/@xmath33(@xmath8u ) = 0.27 .",
    "the @xmath10k nuclides presently contained in the earth were formed during an earlier and more quiet phase of the massive - stars evolution , the so called silicon burning phase  @xcite . in this phase , at temperatures higher than 3.5 @xmath17 10@xmath7 k , @xmath22 particles , protons , and neutrons were ejected by photo - disintegration from the nuclei abundant in these stars and were made available for building - up the light nuclei up to and slightly beyond the iron peak ( a = 65 ) .",
    "being a lighter nucleus , the @xmath10k , beyond the @xmath23 decay shown in eq .",
    "[ eq : geo4 ] , has also a sizeable decay branch ( 10.7% ) by electron capture , see eq .",
    "[ eq : geo5 ] . in this case ,",
    "electron neutrinos are emitted but they are not easily observable because they are overwhelmed by the many orders of magnitude more intense solar - neutrino fluxes . luckily , the earth is mostly shining in antineutrinos ; the sun , conversely , is producing energy by light - nuclide fusion reactions and only neutrinos are yielded during such processes .",
    "both the @xmath10k and @xmath9u geo - neutrinos are below the 1.8mev threshold of eq .",
    "[ eq : invbeta ] , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geonuspe ] , and thus , they can not be detected by this process .",
    "however , the elemental abundances ratios are much better known than the absolute abundances .",
    "therefore , by measuring the absolute content of @xmath8u and @xmath4th , also the overall amount of @xmath10k and @xmath9u can be inferred with an improved precision .",
    "geo - neutrinos are emitted and interact as flavor states but they do travel as superposition of mass states and are therefore subject to flavor oscillations .    in the approximation @xmath34",
    "@xmath25 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 , the square - mass differences of mass eigenstates 1 , 2 , and 3 , the survival probability @xmath38 for a @xmath24 in vacuum is :    @xmath39    in the earth , the geo - neutrino sources are spread over a vast region compared to the oscillation length : @xmath40 for example , for a @xmath253mev antineutrino , the oscillation length is of @xmath25100 km , small with respect to the earth s radius of @xmath256371 km : the effect of the neutrino oscillation to the total neutrino flux is well averaged , giving an overall survival probability of : @xmath41 according to the neutrino oscillation mixing angles and square - mass differences reported in  @xcite , @xmath42 .",
    "while geo - neutrinos propagate through the earth , they feel the potential of electrons and nucleons building - up the surrounding matter .",
    "the charged weak current interactions affect only the electron flavor ( anti)neutrinos . as a consequence",
    ", the hamiltonian for @xmath24 s has an extra term of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the electron density .",
    "since the electron density in the earth is not constant and moreover it shows sharp changes in correspondence with boundaries of different earth s layers , the behavior of the survival probability is not trivial and the motion equations have to be solved by numerical tracing .",
    "it has been calculated in  @xcite that this so called _ matter effect _ contribution to the average survival probability is an increase of about 2% and the spectral distortion is below 1% .",
    "to conclude , the net effect of flavor oscillations during the geo - neutrino ( @xmath24 ) propagation through the earth is the absolute decrease of the overall flux by @xmath250.55 with a very small spectral distortion , negligible for the precision of the current geo - neutrino experiments .",
    "the earth was created in the process of accretion from undifferentiated material , to which chondritic meteorites are believed to be the closest in composition and structure .",
    "the ca - al rich inclusions in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites up to about a cm in size are the oldest known solid condensates from the hot material of the protoplanetary disk . the age of these fine grained structures was determined based on u - corrected pb - pb dating to be @xmath45 million years  @xcite .",
    "thus , these inclusions together with the so called chondrules , another type of inclusions of similar age , provide an upper limit on the age of the earth .",
    "the oldest terrestrial material are zircon inclusions from western australia being at least 4.404 billion years old  @xcite .",
    "the bodies with a sufficient mass undergo the process of differentiation , e. g. , a transformation from an homogeneous object to a body with a layered structure .",
    "the metallic core of the earth ( and presumably also of other terrestrial planets ) was the first to differentiate during the first @xmath2530  million years of the life of the solar system , as inferred based on the @xmath46hf - @xmath46w isotope system  @xcite .",
    "today , the core has a radius of 2890 km , about 45% of the earth radius and represents less than 10% of the total earth volume .    due to the high pressure of about 330gpa",
    ", the inner core with 1220 km radius is solid , despite the high temperature of @xmath255700k , comparable to the temperature of the solar photosphere .    from seismologic studies , and namely from the fact that the secondary , transverse / shear waves do not propagate through the so called outer core , we know that it is liquid .",
    "turbulent convection occurs in this liquid metal of low viscosity .",
    "these movements have a crucial role in the process of the generation of the earth magnetic field , so called geo - dynamo .",
    "the magnetic field here is about 25gauss , about 50 times stronger than at the earth s surface .",
    "the chemical composition of the core is inferred indirectly as fe - ni alloy with up to 10% admixture of light elements , most probable being oxygen and/or sulfur . some high - pressure",
    ", high - temperature experiments confirm that potassium enters iron sulfide melts in a strongly temperature - dependent fashion and that @xmath10k could thus serve as a substantial heat source in the core  @xcite .",
    "however , other authors show that several geo - chemical arguments are not in favor of such hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "geo - neutrinos from @xmath10k have energies below the detection threshold of the current detection method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geonuspe ] ) and thus the presence of potassium in the core can not be tested with geo - neutrino studies based on inverse beta on free protons .",
    "other heat producing elements , such as uranium and thorium are lithophile elements and due to their chemical affinity they are quite widely believed not to be present in the core ( in spite of their high density ) . there",
    "exist , however , ideas as that of herndon  @xcite suggesting an u - driven georeactor with thermal power @xmath4730tw present in the earth s core and confined in its central part within the radius of about 4 km .",
    "the antineutrinos that would be emitted from such a hypothetical georeactor have , as antineutrinos from the nuclear power plants , energies above the end - point of geo - neutrinos from `` standard '' natural radioactive decays .",
    "antineutrino detection provide thus a sensitive tool to test the georeactor hypothesis .",
    "after the separation of the metallic core , the rest of the earth s volume was composed by a presumably homogeneous primitive mantle built of silicate rocks which subsequently differentiated to the present mantle and crust .    above the core mantle boundary ( cmb )",
    "there is a @xmath25200 km thick zone called d ",
    "( pronounced d - double prime ) , a seismic discontinuity characterized by a decrease in the gradient of both p ( primary ) and s ( secondary , shear ) wave velocities .",
    "the origin and character of this narrow zone is under discussion and there is no widely accepted model .    the lower mantle is about 2000 km thick and extends from the d ",
    "zone up to the seismic discontinuity at the depth of 660 km .",
    "this discontinuity does not represent a chemical boundary while a zone of a phase transition and mineral recrystallization . below this zone , in the lower mantle , the dominant mineral phases are the mg - perovskite ( mg@xmath48fe@xmath49)sio@xmath50 , ferropericlase ( mg , fe)o , and ca - perovskite casio@xmath50",
    ". the temperature at the base of the mantle can reach 3700k while at the upper boundary the temperature is about 600k . in spite of such high temperatures , the high lithostatic pressure ( 136gpa at the base )",
    "prevents the melting , since the solidus increases with pressure .",
    "the lower mantle is thus solid , but viscose and undergoes plastic deformation on long time - scales . due to a high temperature gradient and the ability of the mantle to creep ,",
    "there is an ongoing convection in the mantle .",
    "this convection drives the movement of tectonic plates with characteristic velocities of few cm per year .",
    "the convection may be influenced by the mineral recrystallizations occurring at 660 km and 410 km depths , through the density changes and latent heat .",
    "the mantle between these two seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 km depths is called the transition zone .",
    "this zone consists primarily of peridotite rock with dominant minerals garnet ( mostly pyrop mg@xmath50al@xmath51(sio@xmath52)@xmath50 ) and high - pressure polymorphs of olivine ( mg , fe)@xmath51sio@xmath52 , ringwoodite and wadsleyite below and above cca .",
    "525 km depth , respectively .    in the upper mantle above the 410 km depth discontinuity the dominant minerals are olivine , garnet , and pyroxene .",
    "the upper mantle boundary is defined with seismic discontinuity called mohorovii , often referred to as moho .",
    "it s average depth is about 35 km , 5 - 10 km below the oceans and 20 - 90 km below the continents .",
    "the moho lies within the lithosphere , the mechanically defined uppermost earth layer with brittle deformations composed of the crust and the brittle part of the upper mantle , continental lithospheric mantle ( clm ) .",
    "the lithospheric tectonic plates are floating on the more plastic astenosphere entirely composed of the mantle material .",
    "partial melting is a process when solidus and liquidus temperatures are different and are typical for heterogeneous systems as rocks .",
    "the mantle partial melting through geological times lead to the formation of the earth s crust .",
    "typical mantle rocks have a higher magnesium - to - iron ratio and a smaller proportion of silicon and aluminum than the crust .",
    "the crust can be seen as the accumulation of solidified partial liquid , which thanks to its lower density tends to move upwards with respect to denser solid residual .",
    "the lithophile and incompatible elements , such as u and th , tend to concentrate in the liquid phase and thus they do concentrate in the crust .",
    "there are two types of the earth s crust .",
    "the simplest and youngest is the oceanic crust , less than 10 km thick .",
    "it is created by partial melting of the transition - zone mantle along the mid - oceanic ridges on top of the upwelling mantle plumes .",
    "the total length of this submarine mountain range , the so called rift zone , is about 80,000 km .",
    "the age of the oceanic crust is increasing with the perpendicular distance from the rift , symmetrically on both sides .",
    "the oldest large - scale oceanic crust is in the west pacific and north - west atlantic - both are up to 180 - 200 million years old .",
    "however , parts of the eastern mediterranean sea are remnants of the much older tethys ocean , at about 270 million years old .",
    "the typical rock types of the oceanic crust created along the rifts are mid - ocean ridge basalts ( morb ) .",
    "they are relatively enriched in lithophile elements with respect to the mantle from which they have been differentiated but they are much depleted in them with respect to the continental crust .",
    "the typical density of the oceanic crust is about 2.9 g @xmath53 .",
    "the continental crust is thicker , more heterogeneous and older , and has a more complex history with respect to the oceanic crust .",
    "it forms continents and continental shelves covered with shallow seas .",
    "the bulk composition is granitic , more felsic with respect to oceanic crust .",
    "continental crust covers about 40% of the earth surface .",
    "it is much thicker than the oceanic crust , from 20 to 70 km . the average density is 2.7 g @xmath53 , less dense than the oceanic crust and so to the contrary of the oceanic crust , the continental slabs rarely subduct .",
    "therefore , while the subducting oceanic crust gets destroyed and remelted , the continental crust persists . on average",
    ", it has about 2 billion years , while the oldest rock is the acasta gneiss from the continental root ( craton ) in canada is about 4 billion years old .",
    "the continental crust is thickest in the areas of continental collision and compressional forces , where new mountain ranges are created in the process called orogeny , as in the himalayas or in the alps .",
    "there are the three main rock groups building up the continental crust : igneous ( rocks which solidified from a molten magma ( below the surface ) or lava ( on the surface ) ) , sedimentary ( rocks that were created by the deposition of the material as disintegrated older rocks , organic elements etc . ) , and metamorphic ( rocks that recrystallized without melting under the increased temperature and/or pressure conditions ) .",
    "there are several ways in which we can obtain information about the deep earth .",
    "seismology studies the propagation of the p ( primary , longitudinal ) and the s ( secondary , shear , transversal ) waves through the earth and can construct the wave velocities and density profiles of the earth .",
    "it can identify the discontinuities corresponding to mechanical and/or compositional boundaries .",
    "the first order structure of the earth s interior is defined by the 1d seismological profile , called prem : preliminary reference earth model  @xcite .",
    "the recent seismic tomography can reveal structures as large low shear velocity provinces ( llsvp ) below africa and central pacific  @xcite indicating that mantle could be even compositionally non - homogeneous and that it could be tested via future geo - neutrino projects  @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition of the earth is the subject of study of geochemistry .",
    "the direct rock samples are however limited .",
    "the deepest bore - hole ever made is 12 km in kola peninsula in russia .",
    "some volcanic and tectonic processes can bring to the surface samples of deeper origin but often their composition can be altered during the transport .",
    "the pure samples of the lower mantle are practically in - existent . with respect to the mantle",
    ", the composition of the crust is relatively well known .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the bulk composition of the silicate earth , the so called bulk silicate earth ( bse ) models describe the composition of the primitive mantle , the earth composition after the core separation and before the crust - mantle differentiation .",
    "the estimates of the composition of the present - day mantle can be derived as a difference between the mass abundances predicted by the bse models in the primitive mantle and those observed in the present crust . in this way",
    ", the predictions of the u and th mass abundances in the mantle are made , which are then critical in calculating the predicted geo - neutrino signal , see sec .",

    "the refractory elements are those that have high condensation temperatures ; thus , they did condensate from a hot nebula , today form the bulk mass of the terrestrial planets , and are observed in equal proportions in the chondrites .",
    "their contrary are volatile elements with low condensation temperatures and which might have partially escaped from the planet . u and th are refractory elements , while k is moderately volatile .",
    "all u , th , and k are also lithophile ( rock - loving ) elements , which in the goldschmidt geochemical classification means elements tending to stay in the silicate phase ( other categories are siderophile ( metal - loving ) , chalcophile ( ore , chalcogen - loving ) , and atmophile / volatile ) .",

    "[ sec : earth ] , we know relatively well such information for the earth s crust , but we lack it for the mantle . instead , the bse models , also described in sec .",
    "[ sec : earth ] , predict the total amount of hpe in the silicate earth ( so , excluding the metallic core , in which no hpe are expected ) .",
    "thus , in the geo - neutrino signal predictions , the procedure is as follows .",
    "first , the signal from the crust is calculated .",
    "then , the total mass of the hpe concentrated in the crust is subtracted from the hpe mass predicted by a specific bse model ; the remaining amount of hpe is attributed to be concentrated in the mantle .    due to the chemical affinity of hpe , the continental crust is their richest reservoir .",
    "thus , for the experimental sites built on the continental crust , the total geo - neutrino signal is dominated by the crustal component .",
    "it is important to estimate it with the highest possible precision since the mantle contribution can be extracted from the measured signal only after the subtraction of the expected crustal component .    the first estimation of the crustal geo - neutrino signal  @xcite modeled the crust as a homogeneous , 30 km thick layer .",
    "since then , several much more refined models have been developed . in these models ,",
    "different geochemical and geophysical data are used as input parameters .",

    "indeed , recent models predicting geo - neutrino fluxes from the mantle not spherically symmetric have been presented  @xcite .",
    "they are based on the hypothesis , indicated by the geophysical data , that the large low shear velocity provinces ( llsvp ) placed at the base of the mantle beneath africa and the pacific represent also compositionally distinct areas . in a particular ,",

    "all the earth models are still compatible at 2@xmath75 level with the measurement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kbsra ] , even if the present combined analysis slightly disfavors the geodynamical models .",
    "we remind that these models are based on the assumption that the radiogenic heat has provided the power to sustain the mantle convection over the whole earth story .",
    "it has been recently understood  @xcite the importance of the water or water vapor embedded in the crust and mantle to decrease the rock viscosity and so the energy supply required to promote the convection . if this is the case the geodynamical models are going to be reconciled with the geochemical ones .",
    "it is , in principle , possible to extract from the measured geo - neutrino signal the earth s radiogenic heat power .",
    "this procedure is however not straightforward : the geoneutrino flux depends not only on the total mass of hpe in the earth , but also on their distributions , which is model dependent .",
    "the hpe abundances and so the radiogenic heat in the crust are rather well known , as discussed in secs .",

    "if the error of the measured mantle geo - neutrino signal is considered ( @xmath91tnu ) , the corresponding interval of possible mantle radiogenic heat is from 2 to 19.5tw , indicated by the black arrow on @xmath92-axis .",
