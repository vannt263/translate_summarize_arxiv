    "the central exclusive production ( cep ) of new particles has received a great deal of attention in recent years ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the process is defined as @xmath0 and all of the energy lost by the protons during the interaction ( a few percent ) is used in the production of the central system , @xmath1 .",
    "the final state therefore consists of a centrally produced hard subprocess , two very forward protons and no other activity .",
    "the @xmath2 sign denotes the regions devoid of activity , often called rapidity gaps . in double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) , the central system contains remnants from the diffractive exchange in addition to the hard subprocess .",
    "more details on the diffraction physics program of the atlas experiment can be found e.g. in @xcite .",
    "at low luminosity , the diffractive processes can be detected using rapidity gaps .",
    "a possible l1 trigger would be based on a requirement of a rapidity gap on one or both sides from the ip and an activity in the central detector with energy over a certain threshold .",
    "the gap may span the region from the forward calorimeters of the atlas detector @xcite or cms detector @xcite over the luminosity detectors ( lucid @xcite in atlas or totem @xcite in cms ) up to zdc detectors in atlas @xcite or in cms @xcite .",
    "measurements which would be straightforward and hence suitable for analyses of the very early lhc data are ratios of the kind of x@xmath3gaps / x(incl . ) , where x may be w , z , dijet , heavy quark and dilepton , and x(incl . )",
    "means measuring x without requiring rapidity gaps .",
    "measurements of ratios are convenient since many sources of systematic uncertainties are canceled , particularly that of the luminosity at the early phase and among other , they also serve as valuable checks of different components of the formalism used to predict the cep cross section by the kmr group @xcite .",
    "the soft survival probability , @xmath4 , can be studied in electroweak processes , such as w@xmath3gaps or z@xmath3 gaps .",
    "@xmath4 is defined as a probability that additional soft secondaries will not populate the gaps and it explains the factorization breaking observed at hadron colliders when diffractive parton density functions ( dpdf ) obtained in single diffraction ( sd ) at hera were applied in measurements of sd by cdf @xcite .",
    "the generalized gluon distribution , @xmath5 , can be probed in exclusive @xmath6 production proceeding via either a photon or an odderon exchange .",
    "the higher - order qcd effects , especially sudakov - like factors and also a possible role of the enhanced absorptive corrections can be studied in exclusive two- or three - jet events .",
    "when the proton tagging becomes available , the t - dependence of the elastic , sd and dpe cross sections can be obtained and hence effect of individual components of the pile - up background can be evaluated .      without proton tagging , the dijet production in dpe and cep can be measured by requiring two central jets and rapidity gaps on both sides of the ip in forward calorimeter , lucid / totem and zdc . in dpe",
    ", the rapidity gaps may be spoiled by particles from the pomeron remnants and although the cross section is about two orders of magnitude larger than the cep cross section at the same dijet mass , the cep cross section will dominate if the forward calorimeter is required to be devoid of activity .",
    "the measurement of the dijet production in cep at 714  tev may be compared with a similar measurement made at tevatron from which models used to describe the data may be constrained .      by selecting events with two jets",
    "each in opposite side of forward calorimeter and a rapidity gap in the central detector , atlas and cms can improve an existing measurement of this type by d0 @xcite at centre - of - mass ( c.m.s . )",
    "energy of 1.8  tev .",
    "different colour singlet exchange models can be tested by comparing data with predictions for the gap fractions as functions of rapidity between the jets .",
    "a great attention is recently devoted to the possibility of complementing the standard lhc physics menu by adding forward proton detectors ( fpd ) to the atlas and cms detectors .",
    "they would detect a great part of the energy flow that escapes undetected by the main detectors .",
    "the forward proton tagging will provide an exceptionally clean environment to search for new phenomena at the lhc and to identify their nature . of particular interest in this context",
    "is the cep which gives access to the generalized ( or skewed ) pdfs .",
    "the cep of a sm ( or mssm ) higgs boson is attractive for two reasons : firstly , if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter through small angles then , to a good approximation , the central system @xmath1 must be produced in a @xmath7 , cp even state , therefore allowing a clean determination of the quantum numbers of any observed resonance .",
    "here @xmath8 is the projection of the total angular momentum along the proton beam axis .",
    "secondly , from precise measurements of proton momentum losses , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the mass of the central system can be measured much more precisely than from the dijet mass measured in the calorimeters , by the so - called missing mass method , @xmath11 , which is independent of the decay mode .",
    "the simplest decay mode from an experimental perspective is the ww decay mode , in which one ( or both ) of the w bosons decay leptonically . with standard single and double lepton trigger thresholds at atlas ( or cms ) , approximately 6 events are expected for higgs boson mass around 160 gev with luminosity of 30  fb@xmath12 @xcite . in the b@xmath13  decay mode , the quantum number selection rules in cep strongly suppress the qcd b - jet background , nevertheless severe requirements necessary to get rid of the pile - up background make the event yield rather modest @xcite .",
    "full details of the calculation of the background to this channel are described in @xcite .    in certain regions of the mssm parameter space the cross section for the cep of higgs bosons is significantly enhanced and hence making the b@xmath13  decay mode attractive @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ mass_spectrum ] an example mass spectrum is shown for mssm higgs boson candidates of mass of 120  gev decaying into b@xmath13  for @xmath14 ( corresponding to the final cross section of about 18  fb ) after 3  years of data taking at luminosity of @xmath15 @xmath16s@xmath12 or 3 years at @xmath17 @xmath16s@xmath12 . at the low luminosity",
    ", the pile - up background can be completely eliminated and the statistical significance is around 3.5@xmath18 . at the highest luminosity ,",

    "nmssm provides the @xmath22 channel which in cep gives a very good signal - to - background ratio and is interesting from the experimental perspective @xcite . also , an excellent mass measurement of the neutral higgs boson decaying into b@xmath13  in the triplet model is possible in the forward proton mode @xcite .",
    "the tagging of both protons in fpds will enable a measurement of the proton transverse momenta and azimuthal angles which allows us to study the opacity of the incoming protons , and more generally , to test the dynamics of the soft survival probability by studying the correlations between the outgoing protons @xcite .",
    "this can be carried out with the cep of dijets as the cross section is large .",
    "thanks to the @xmath23 selection rule which is applicable to all cep processes , quark jet production is suppressed and the cep can then be recognized as reduced ratio of b - jets to all jets when compared to other production processes .",
    "the sd and dpe processes serve to provide an information about the low - x structure of the proton and the dpdfs .",
    "inclusive jet and heavy quark production are mainly sensitive to the gluon component of the dpdfs , while vector boson production is sensitive to quarks .",
    "the kinematic region covered expands that explored at hera and tevatron , with values of @xmath24 ( the fractional momentum of the struck parton in the diffractive exchange ) as low as @xmath25 and of q@xmath26 up to @xmath27 gev@xmath26 .",
    "more information about the sd dijet and w boson production can be found elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .      as the lhc beams act also as a source of high - energy photons",
    "a rich program of photon - photon and photon - proton physics can be pursued .",
    "photon - induced processes have been extensively studied at lep and hera . however at lhc , these processes can be investigated in an unexplored region of the phase - space .",
    "the final state topology is similar to cep , i.e. a central system , x , separated on each side by large rapidity gap from a very forward proton detected in the fpd .",
    "different average proton transverse momenta make it possible to separate between diffractive and photon - induced events .",
    "the w- and z - pair production ( as a tool to study anomalous triple and quartic gauge couplings ) is discussed elsewhere in these proceedings @xcite .",
    "the susy particle production is described in @xcite .",
    "two - photon exclusive production of muon pairs has a well known qed cross section , including very small hadronic corrections @xcite .",
    "very recently , such event candidates have been observed by the cdf @xcite and their cross sections found in a good agreement with theory .",
    "after applying simple selection criteria such as @xmath28 10  gev , @xmath29 2.5 and requiring one forward proton tag , the cross section is 1.3  pb @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to approximately 50  muon pairs detected in a 12  hour run at a mean luminosity of @xmath30@xmath16s@xmath12 .",
    "the large event rate coupled with a small theoretical uncertainty makes this process a perfect candidate for the absolute lhc luminosity calibration @xcite and also of the fpd system at 420  m @xcite .",
    "the @xmath31 production can also be studied , although the trigger thresholds will be larger and hence the final event rate reduced .",
    "the high luminosity and the high c.m.s .",
    "energies available for photoproduction processes at the lhc allows us to study electroweak interactions and to search beyond the standard model up to the tev scale @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the cross section for the associated wh production ( @xmath32 after applying selection criteria and considering five different final states is 0.17  fb at m@xmath33 = 115  gev and 0.29  fb at m@xmath33 = 170  gev .",
    "the most promising channel seems to be the @xmath34 at m@xmath33 = 170  gev where the signal to irreducible background ratio is 0.22  fb/0.28  fb , so luminosity of 100 fb@xmath12 might reveal the @xmath35 gauge coupling .",
    "photoproduction of single top quark ( @xmath36 ) is dominated by t - channel amplitudes in association with a w boson which all are proportional to the ckm matrix element @xmath37 .",
    "the ratio of associated wt production cross section to the sum of all top production cross sections is 5% for parton - parton interactions , while it is 50% in photoproduction . in @xcite",
    "two topologies were studied , namely @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the signal cross section after selection cuts of about 44  fb with a signal to irreducible background ratio of 0.6 suggest that this mechanism and hence @xmath37 may be easily measurable even with luminosity of 1  fb@xmath12 .    at lhc",
    "the exclusive single top quark photoproduction can only occur via flavour changing neutral current processes which are not present at tree level of sm but appear in many extensions of sm such as two higgs - doublet models or r - parity violating supersymmetry .",
    "the final state of this @xmath40 process is composed of a b - jet and a w boson . in @xcite",
    "the leptonic @xmath41 topology was studied and only photoproduction @xmath42 background considered . with an integrated luminosity of 1",
    "fb@xmath12 the expected limits for anomalous couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 at 95% cl are greatly improved with respect to existing best estimates .      in photoproduction of jets ,",
    "the fraction of the photon , @xmath45 , and proton , @xmath46 , four - momentum carried by a parton involved in binary hard scattering is calculated using the energies and angles of jets in the central detector and of the protons in the fpds .",
    "the direct photon processes are characterized by @xmath47 and resolved photon processes by @xmath48 .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have constrained the region @xmath49 for diffractive photoproduction . at lhc",
    "we expect to reach values of @xmath46 and @xmath45 of an order of magnitude lower than at hera .",
    "furthermore , the diffractive photoproduction of dijet systems at the lhc promises to shed light on the issue of the qcd factorization breaking recently reported in the same process by the h1 experiment @xcite .",
    "exclusive @xmath6 photoproduction , @xmath50 can be studied using fpds @xcite , although only one proton can be tagged due to the low mass of the @xmath6 .",
    "the cross section is expected to be approximately 1.25  pb for the decay channel @xmath51 and is sensitive to the same skewed unintegrated gluon densities of the proton as the cep of higgs boson . measuring",
    "this process thus helps to constrain the @xmath5 as the soft survival factor is expected to be close to 1 .",
    "the @xmath50 process can also occur via odderon exchange and this channel could be the first evidence for the odderon s existence .",
    "the fp420 r&d collaboration @xcite , with members from atlas , cms and lhc studied the possibility of installing high precision tracking and timing detectors at 420  m from the ip .",
    "detection of the protons will be achieved by two 3d silicon detector stations at each end of the fp420 region .",
    "this novel technique provides high radiation - resistive detectors close to the beam with an insensitive area as small as 5  @xmath52 m and with a resolution of about 15  @xmath52 m .",
    "the tracking and timing detectors will be attached to a movable beam pipe .",
    "as the beam pipes in the 420  m region are contained in an interconnecting cryostat and the sensitive detectors are best operated at room temperature , a new connection cryostat has been designed using a modified arc termination module at each end .",
    "the afp project ( atlas forward proton ) @xcite is a combined effort to install fpds at 220 and 420  m from the ip of atlas .",
    "the 420  m region has been described above and the proposed equipment for the 220  m region is very similar ; differences are mainly in no need to change the cryostat and an addition of a detector to be used for l1 trigger .",
    "the detectors will be read out by standard abcnext chip being developed for the silicon detectors in atlas .      with the position resolution of 15  @xmath52 m",
    "we expect a mass resolution of the order of 12% for the 420 + 420 and about 3% for the 420 + 220 configurations over a mass range of 120200  gev . for given dipole apertures and collimator settings and a thin window of 200 @xmath52 m ,",
    "the expected @xmath53 range is 0.0020.02 for 420 + 420 and 0.010.15 for the 420 + 220 configuration .",
    "the low-@xmath53 ( and therefore low mass ) acceptance depends critically on the distance of approach of the active area of the sensitive detectors from the beam .",
    "the final distance of approach will depend on the beam conditions , machine - induced backgrounds and collimator positions , and the rf impact of the detector on the beams . at 420",
    "m the nominal operating position is assumed to be between 5 and 7.5  mm , at 220  m it is between 2.0 and 2.5  mm .",
    "for masses above about 120  gev , the 220  m detector adds to the acceptance with increasing importance as the central mass increases .",
    "the differences between atlas and cms acceptances for the 420 + 420 as well as 420 + 220 configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ mh - acc ] ) are due to a different crossing angle which is in the vertical plane for ip1 ( atlas ) and horizontal plane at ip5 ( cms ) .",
    "the most prominent background to many diffractive physics analyses comes from an overlap of two soft sd events from pile - up and one nd event produced at a hard scale .",
    "fast timing detectors with an expected sub-10 ps time resolution corresponding to a vertex resolution of better than 2.1 mm should be able to assign a vertex to the proton detected in the fpd and to reject about 97% of cases that appear to be cep events but where the protons in reality originated from coincidences with pile - up events .",
    "presently two detector options are studied , namely quartz and gas cerenkov which may be read out with a constant fraction discriminator allowing the time resolution to be significantly improved compared to usual electronics .",
    "due to a limited l1 trigger latency , detectors at 420  m are far away from the central detectors to be included in the l1 trigger in normal running conditions , while detectors at 220  m can in principle be included .",
    "the trigger strategy depends on the mass of the diffractively produced object @xcite .",
    "demanding standard l1 triggers such as those for high mass h@xmath54ww / zz or high-@xmath55 dijet trigger would result in an acceptable output rate which may be further reduced by requiring the double proton tag at 220  m. triggering on low mass objects is more difficult but in principle feasible as documented in @xcite where diffractive l1 triggers for a case of h  @xmath54  b@xmath13  at @xmath56=120  gev have been proposed .",
    "if the fpd trigger at 220  m is capable of triggering only on hits in the inner 4  mm part and if the l1 calorimeter is capable of defining exclusivity criteria using @xmath57 and @xmath1 , then the final output rate is well below a 2  khz limit at @xmath58@xmath16s@xmath12 and slightly above this limit at @xmath59@xmath16s@xmath12 .",
    "other reductions are under study @xcite .",
