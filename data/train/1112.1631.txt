    "in the past few years there has been a remarkable progress in the determination of fermion masses and mixing @xcite , involving advances both in theory and experiment . in the quark sector , input from experiment includes the knowledge of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , together with the measurement of the rephasing invariant angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the framework of the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "these results constrain the location of the vertex of the unitarity triangle to a small region .",
    "the measurement of the angle @xmath10 is specially important since it provides clear evidence that the cabibbo- kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite is complex , even if one allows for the presence of new physics beyond the sm @xcite . in the leptonic sector ,",
    "non - vanishing neutrino masses and mixing has been established @xcite . however , there are still important open questions like the nature of the neutrino mass spectrum ( normal hierarchy , inverted hierarchy or quasi degenerate ) , the determination of whether neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles , as well as the search for leptonic cp violation . in this respect ,",
    "the recent evidence in favour of a non - vanishing value of @xmath11 , provides the hope of discovering leptonic cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "it is well known that having a non - vanishing @xmath11  is a necessary requirement in order to have leptonic dirac - type cp violation , which is detectable in neutrino oscillations .    in spite of these developments",
    ", one does not have yet a standard theory of flavour .",
    "one may adopt a bottom - up approach and try to discover a symmetry principle from the observed pattern of fermion masses and mixing .",
    "one of the difficulties that one encounters in following this approach , stems from the fact that there is a large redundancy in the yukawa couplings @xmath12 , @xmath13  which generate the quark masses @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "one can make weak - basis ( wb ) transformations which change @xmath14 , @xmath15 , but do not alter their physical content .",
    "the above considerations also apply to flavour models which postulate the existence of so - called `` texture - zeros '' .",
    "it is clear that these zeros only exist in a particular wb .",
    "the above redundancy in yukawa couplings and fermion mass matrices motivates the use of wb invariants , i.e. functions of quark masses which do not change when one preforms a wb transformation .",
    "these wb invariants are very useful in the analysis of cp violation , where they have been derived from first principles @xcite and have been applied to both the quark @xcite and lepton @xcite sectors , including leptogenesis , as well as to the higgs sector @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the main features of the pattern of fermion masses and mixing can be expressed in terms of simple relations involving only wb invariants .",
    "we introduce the concept of `` alignment '' , which can be understood in the following way . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the quark sector , where small flavour mixing is indicated by experiment .",
    "small mixing implies that there is a wb where both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are close to the diagonal form . however , experiment shows more than that , it tells us that the quark mass matrices are aligned in flavour space , meaning that there is a basis where @xmath16 and @xmath14 is close to @xmath17 and not to @xmath18 , for example .",
    "obviously , only the relative ordering of the eigenvalues of @xmath14 , @xmath15 is physically meaningful , since by making a wb transformation , one can change simultaneously the eigenvalue ordering in @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    at this point",
    ", it is worth recalling that in the context of the sm , the yukawa couplings leading to @xmath14 and @xmath15 are entirely independent , there is no `` dialog '' . between @xmath12 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , in the context of the sm , or its minimal supersymmetric extension , alignment is in no way more `` natural '' than misalignment .",
    "quite on the contrary , if one considers the manifold of matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 leading to `` small mixing '' as previously defined , the probability of having alignment is only 1/6 .    in this paper we will show how wb invariants can distinguish not only between small mixing and large mixing , but also between alignment and misalignment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : . in the next section ,",
    "we consider the quark sector , where we illustrate the usefulness of wb invariants for two and three generations . in section 3 , we apply wb invariants to the study of some anstze for quark mass matrices , while in section 4 we briefly study the lepton sector , showing in particular how the observed pattern of leptonic mixing can be obtained through a set of conditions on wb invariants .",
    "our conclusions are contained in section 5 .",
    "for simplicity and in order to explain the concept of alignment and its connection to weak - basis invariants , we consider first the case of two generations .",
    "the three important features of quark masses and mixing are :    \\(i ) hierarchical quark masses ,    \\(ii ) small mixing ,    \\(iii ) alignment .",
    "we consider separately each one of these features , emphasizing that they are logically independent , at least in the context of the sm .",

    "the hierarchy of lepton masses may also be expressed in terms of invariants of @xmath213 . for the charged leptons",
    "one may use essentially the same invariants as the quarks . for the neutrinos , the invariant @xmath214}{tr[h_{\\nu } ] ^{2 } }   \\label{hier2n}\\ ] ] may distinguish normal hierarchy corresponding to @xmath215 from inverted hierarchy ( @xmath216 ) and degeneracy ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "the invariant @xmath218\\ det[h_{\\nu } ] } { \\left ( \\chi [ h_{\\nu } ] \\right ) ^{2 } }   \\label{hier3n}\\ ] ] may also be used to distinguish inverted hierarchy when @xmath219 is small from degeneracy when @xmath220 .",
    "furthermore , for normal hierarchy , it can distinguish the cases when one of the two smaller masses is much small then the other one , @xmath221 , or the case when these two small masses are of the same order . in this case",
    "@xmath222  is of order one@xmath223 thus , we have @xmath224      for definiteness , let us assume that neutrinos have normal hierarchy , with @xmath225 .",
    "next , we show that one can use a set of wb invariants of the lepton sector in order to fix the leptonic mixing matrix . in the limit , @xmath226 ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath227\\ tr[h_{l}h_{\\nu } ] -tr[h_{l}^{2}h_{\\nu } ] } { \\chi [ h_{l}]\\ tr[h_{\\nu } ] } = \\frac{\\frac{m_{1}^{2}}{m_{3}^{2}}\\    the experimental data show that the leptonic mixing matrix is close to the tribimaximal mixing @xcite . in particular , it is shown that @xmath228 is small . from eq .",
    "( [ limit - v13 ] ) , it follows that this can be guaranteed by having @xmath229 . on the other hand , the associated invariant @xmath230 , obtained by interchanging @xmath231 and @xmath232 yields in the limit @xmath233 : @xmath234\\ tr[h_{\\nu } h_{l}]-tr[h_{\\nu } ^{2}h_{l}]}{\\chi [ h_{\\nu } ] \\ tr[h_{l}]}=\\frac{\\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{m_{\\tau } ^{2}}\\ |v_{21}|^{2}+|v_{31}|^{2}}{1+\\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{m_{\\tau } ^{2 } } }   \\label{v13n}\\ ] ] by putting @xmath235 , one has @xmath236 as in the tribimaximal mixing .",
    "then , computing the leptonic invariant equivalent to that of eqs .",
    "( [ i10 ] , [ chia3 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath237\\right| = \\left| v_{23}\\right| ^{2}+\\left| v_{13}\\right| ^{2}+o\\left ( \\left ( \\frac{m_{2}}{m_{3}}\\right ) ^{4}\\right ) \\label{chian}\\ ] ] which must be near @xmath238 for tri - bimaximal mixing . with @xmath239 , @xmath230 and @xmath240 $ ] and the unitarity of @xmath241 one can ensure that the mixing is near to the tri - bimaximal mixing : if @xmath242 is small and @xmath243 is near @xmath238 , then @xmath244 must also be near to @xmath238 .",
    "since @xmath245 is near to @xmath246 , it follows that @xmath247 is near to @xmath248 and then @xmath249 and @xmath250 are near to @xmath251 and @xmath248 respectively .",
    "we have thus shown how to obtain the observed pattern of leptonic mixing through a set of invariant conditions .",
    "we pointed out that the use of weak - basis invariants can avoid the well known redundancy of free parameters in the flavour structure of mass matrices .",
    "these invariants are specially useful when one opts for a bottom - up approach to the study of the flavour structure of yukawa couplings and fermion mass matrices .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the pattern of fermion mixing both in the quark and lepton sectors can be expressed in terms of relations only involving weak - basis invariants .",
    "we have also pointed out the observed alignment of the up and down quark mass matrices in flavour space can also be guaranteed through a weak - basis invariant condition . it was emphasized that in the context of the sm , the above alignment in no way follows automatically from the yukawa couplings structure , since @xmath12 and @xmath19  are independent . on the other hand ,",
    "this alignment may arise naturally , e.g. in left - right symmetric theories or in @xmath252 , where @xmath12 and @xmath19  may be approximately proportional to each other .    in summary , wb invariants may play an important rle in a systematic search for patterns of fermion mass matrices consistent with experiment and may thus help to uncover a possible flavour symmetry chosen by nature .",
