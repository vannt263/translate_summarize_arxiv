    "the standard central limit theorem ( clt ) is a cornerstone of probability theory @xcite .",
    "it establishes that a sum of independent ( identical ) random variables , under a suitable rescaling , converges to a gaussian distribution .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in the formulation of statistical thermodynamics and also provide a rigorous basis for assuming gaussian statistics for describing fluctuations in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems .",
    "there exist a few remarkable examples where the standard clt was generalized .",
    "the gaussian attractor arises when considering independent random variables with a finite second moment .",
    "as is well known , when this condition is raised up the attractor becomes a levy distribution @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gumbel distribution arises from the study of extreme value statistics and describes the fluctuations of the largest value in a large set of identically distributed independent random variables gumbel .",
    "interestingly , this problem can in general be related with the statistics of random sums of correlated random variables @xcite .",
    "departure from gaussian statistics was also analyzed for global correlations where the characteristic function of the total sum is defined by a non - multiplicative fourier structure @xcite .",
    "recently it was argued that the presence of global correlations in stationary equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems is a situation where nonextensive statistical mechanics may applies @xcite .",
    "consistently , many theoretical effort was devoted to finding global memory mechanisms that lead to attractors defined by @xmath0-gaussian probability densities hilhorst , qhanel , qcentrallimit , rodri , qurnas , plastino .",
    "these statistical objects also arise from maximizing tsallis entropy @xcite , from superstatistical models @xcite , as well as from specific transformations of gamma distributed random variables @xcite .",
    "global correlations are a mechanism that may lead to departures from gaussian statistics .",
    "nevertheless , establishing a generalization of the clt on the basis of  only this feature is a formidable task .",
    "in fact , to our knowledge , there not exist general rigorous mathematical criteria for splitting correlations in weak ones ( leading to gaussian statistics ) and stronger ones ( departure from normal distribution ) .",
    "therefore , as in the previous literature bertin , baldowin , tsallisbook , rapisarda , tirnakli , ruseckas , qhanel , qcentrallimit , rodri , qurnas , plastino , hilhorst , one is naturally forced to study particular cases . of special interest",
    "is to find generalizations that rely on simple correlation mechanisms or symmetries , which in turn also allow defining or studying its domain of attraction . in general , this last issue is hard to solve .    in this paper",

    "similar interchangeable random variables finetti , jaynes , hewit , heath , kingman are considered .",
    "this property or symmetry , originally introduced by de finetti @xcite in probability theory , is defined by random variables whose joint probability density is invariant under arbitrary permutations of its arguments .",
    "the main goal is twofold .",
    "first , we give a general characterization of possible correlations mechanisms consistent with interchangeability .",
    "this objective is achieved by characterizing the correlations not through the joint probability densities but through the transition probabilities .",
    "these functions say us how the probability density of a given variable depends on the previous values assumed by the rest of the random variables .",
    "we demonstrate that these objects obey a set of hierarchical equations that resemble a chapman - kolmogorov equation for markovian chains feller , vankampen , gardiner . from this result",
    "we construct different correlation models which allow us to achieve the second main goal , that is , the characterization of the departure from gaussian statistics as well as to study their domain of attraction . for a class of urn models norman , pitman , queen , restaurante , we demonstrate that their domain of attraction is as wide as in the standard case .",
