    "most scenarios for the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) involve a combination of energy deposition in the matter surrounding the nascent proto neutron star  ( pns ) and multi - dimensional hydrodynamic flows .",
    "examples for means of energy transfer to the sn ejecta are the prompt bounce shock , neutrinos , magnetic fields and acoustic waves . in the neutrino - heating mechanism neutrinos tap the gravitational potential energy released during collapse and deposit a part of it behind the stalled shock . this process is enhanced and thus supported by non - radial fluid flows triggered by hydrodynamic instabilities like convection and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )    it is safe to assume that the collapsing stellar core will possess a magnetic field of some ( uncertain ) strength and topology .",
    "this assumption is supported by observational evidence for the presence of surface magnetic fields of up to @xmath3 in white dwarfs , which resemble in many respects the iron cores of evolved massive stars @xcite .",
    "furthermore , neutron stars created in sne may be endowed with magnetic fields @xmath4 g ( pulsars ) to @xmath5 g ( magnetars ; see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless , the possible influence of the field on the explosion is less clear .",
    "the main reason for the small number of conclusive investigations into this topic is that important effects are expected to occur only when the magnetic field is roughly in equipartition with the kinetic energy of the gas flow , a condition corresponding to extremely strong fields similar to those observed in magnetars .",
    "this makes full mhd simulations including a treatment of the important neutrino physics in the sn core indispensable .",
    "stellar evolution calculations , predicting only weak pre - collapse magnetic fields @xcite , render the prospects for magnetically affected explosions very much dependent on the amount of field amplification happening during and after collapse .",
    "rapid differential rotation may amplify a weak seed field quite generically to dynamically relevant values , e.g.  by winding up a poloidal field ( a process linear in time ) or , exponentially in time , by the magneto - rotational instability ( mri , for a review , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the potential relevance of the latter in supernova cores was first pointed out and explored by @xcite .",
    "magneto - rotational explosions , theoretically discussed by @xcite , have been studied in various approximations , e.g.  by @xcite .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations employing ( detailed ) microphysics ( neutrinos and a sophisticated high - density equation of state ) have been performed by @xcite and by @xcite and @xcite . while the former used a multi - group flux - limited diffusion treatment for the neutrino transport in a newtonian framework , the latter approximated the effects of neutrino radiation by a parametrisation of the pre - bounce deleptonisation of the core .",
    "albeit using simplified neutrino physics , the high - resolution global simulations of @xcite addressed one of the most severe problems in numerical models of magneto - rotational collapse , viz .",
    "the extremely high resolution required to resolve the fastest growing mri modes .",
    "however , according to stellar - evolution models , the majority of progenitors is expected to rotate slowly .",
    "although many stars on the upper main sequence show a surface rotation period close to the critical value for mass shedding , they will most likely lose most of their angular momentum during their subsequent evolution , e.g.  by strong stellar winds or magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "non - rotating cores , albeit lacking the above - mentioned efficient channels for amplification , may experience field growth by several effects :    1 .   due to the extremely low resistivity of the sn core matter ,",
    "the magnetic field lines are frozen in the flow .",
    "hence , the compression of the gas during the collapse is accompanied by an increase of the field strength by roughly three orders of magnitude , while the topology of the field does not change .",
    "2 .   after bounce",
    ", convection develops in the pns and the surrounding hot - bubble region . breaking down into three - dimensional turbulence",
    ", convection may provide the @xmath6 effect responsible for a small - scale dynamo amplifying the field on length scales comparable to the scale of turbulent forcing , i.e.  the size of convective eddies @xcite .",
    "however , the generation of a large - scale field , e.g.  on the scale of the pns , probably requires a non - vanishing kinetic helicity of the turbulent flow , which can most naturally be accounted for by ( differential ) rotation ( see , e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and subsequently @xcite have demonstrated that the standing - accretion - shock instability , growing through acoustic and advective perturbations that form a positive feedback cycle between the shock wave and the deceleration region above the pns , has the potential to amplify the magnetic field by up to four orders of magnitude .",
    "dynamically relevant field strengths ( in which case the field reaches at least 10% of equipartition with the kinetic energy ) can be reached only when the pre - collapse field in the stellar core is sufficiently strong .",
    "non - radial fluid motions triggered by these instabilities can excite perturbations of the magnetic field propagating as alfvn  waves along the field lines .",
    "the outward propagation of alfvn  waves excited close to the pns has to compete with the accretion of gas towards the centre . assuming that the accretion flow decelerates in this region continuously , @xcite argue that there must be an _",
    "alfvn  point _ at which the alfvn  speed equals the accretion velocity , and the propagation of the wave ( measured in the lab frame ) comes to a rest .",
    "they show that alfvn  waves are amplified exponentially at such a stagnation point . for the conditions of a supernova core",
    ", the amplification should be most efficient for a magnetic field strength of a few @xmath7 g and could yield final fields of the order of @xmath8 g. dissipation of the wave energy can increase the entropy of the gas , thus modifying the dynamics in the accretion region . for even stronger fields ,",
    "the alfvn  point can be close to the shock wave . in this case , @xcite find that the explosion can be driven solely by the energy deposited by the dissipation of alfvn  waves .",
    "this process transmitting energy from the ( convectively active ) pns to the much less dense surrounding medium bears a strong similarity to the proposed mechanism for heating the solar corona by alfvn  waves emerging from the solar surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "previous simulations of magnetohydrodynamic stellar core collapse have used a wide variety of methods to treat the effects of neutrinos : in the simplest models , they were either ignored ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or treated by simple parameterizations or local source terms ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; more complex approaches include trapping / leakage schemes ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , multi - dimensional , energy - dependent flux - limited diffusion @xcite or the isotropic - diffusion source approximation , which distinguishes between trapped and free - streaming components to avoid the treatment of stiff source terms @xcite . in our approach to radiation - magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) , we employ a new multi - dimensional and energy - dependent scheme for the neutrino transport in supernova cores , namely a two - moment solver for the neutrino energy ( lepton number ) and momentum equations with an analytic closure relation @xcite .",
    "two - moment closure schemes for neutrino transport were also applied in relativistic simulations of black hole - torus systems by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and in stellar core collapse by @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of this work to extend and improve our previous study @xcite . employing a more detailed analysis",
    ", we investigate the relevance of field amplification mechanisms like those in points ( i)-(iv )  concerning their importance for the evolution and potential revival of the stalled shock by core - collapse simulations including a reasonably good treatment of the relevant microphysics .",
    "in particular , we will study the field growth connected to convective and sasi activity in the post - shock layer and the role of energy transport and dissipation by alfvn  waves . to this end , we perform mhd simulations of collapse and post - bounce evolution of the core of a star of 15 solar masses @xcite . varying the strength of the initial field , we can determine different regimes and mechanisms of field amplification and identify the back - reaction of the field onto the flow and the ultimate onset of an explosion .",
    "in contrast to current models of stellar evolution , which predict predominantly toroidal magnetic fields @xcite , we start our simulations from purely poloidal initial fields .",
    "this choice is in part motivated by the use of similar initial fields in previous studies of core collapse ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , in axisymmetric models neglecting rotation , there is no topological difference between the @xmath9- and @xmath10-components of the field , and a field containing the radial and the @xmath9-component is qualitatively equivalent to a field consisting of all three components .",
    "hence , we do not expect this choice of the initial field geometry to have a crucial influence on our results .",
    "this article is organised as follows : sect.[sek : model ] describes our physical model and the numerical methods ; sect.[sek : init ] introduces the initial conditions ; sect.[sek : results ] presents the results of our simulations ; sect.[sek : sumcon ] gives a summary of the study and draws some conclusions .",
    "we assume that the evolution of the gas and the magnetic field is described by the equations of newtonian ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , @xmath11 describing the conservation of mass , electron - lepton number , gas momentum , total energy of the matter , and magnetic flux , respectively .",
    "in addition to these evolutionary equations , the magnetic field has to fulfil the divergence constraint , @xmath12 the symbols used in this system have standard meanings : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are mass density , electron fraction , velocity , magnetic field , gas pressure , and the gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "the total energy density is defined as the sum of internal energy density , @xmath16 , kinetic energy density , and magnetic energy density , @xmath17 , and the total pressure contains the contributions of the gas pressure and the magnetic pressure , @xmath18 .",
    "the source terms @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , account for the exchange of ( net ) electron number , energy , and momentum between the gas and the neutrinos , respectively , and will be discussed below .",
    "we use a finite - volume code based on the constrained - transport formulation of the equations of newtonian ideal magnetohydrodynamics and employing high - resolution monotonicity - preserving reconstruction schemes of @xmath21 order @xcite and the hll riemann solver within the musta framework @xcite .",
    "the stellar material is described by the equation of state ( eos ) of @xcite with a compressibility of @xmath22 at high densities above @xmath23 . below that threshold",
    ", we use the treatment of the vertex simulations as applied in @xcite including leptons , nuclei ( si and ni ) , and radiation .",
    "we approximate general relativistic gravity by version a of the tov potential of @xcite .",
    "we will outline the basics of our treatment of neutrino physics in the following . for a detailed description of the transport scheme and its implementation",
    ", we refer to a forthcoming publication by just , obergaulinger , & janka .",
    "we solve the comoving - frame energy - dependent , multi - dimensional moment equations for the energy density , @xmath24 , and energy flux , @xmath25 , of neutrinos of energy @xmath26 ( the subscript @xmath6 distinguishes between neutrino flavours ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( the neutrino pressure tensor ) and @xmath29 are the second and third angular moments of the neutrino distribution function and @xmath30 denotes the fluid velocity , respectively .",
    "in addition to energy and momentum conservation ( in the absence of source terms ) , the neutrino numbers need to be conserved as well , if sources and sinks do not play a role .",
    "this is not automatically guaranteed by numerical schemes that solve the moment equations for the energy density and energy flux . however , with a suitable discretisation scheme for equations ( [ gl : rt-0mom ] ) and ( [ gl : rt-1mom ] ) , this problem can be overcome ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum translates into the following relations for the source terms in the fluid equations : @xmath31 the source term for the conservation equation of net electron number , eq.([gl : mhd - y_e ] ) , follows from the source term for energy , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "presently only electron neutrinos and antineutrinos are considered , i.e.  @xmath34 .",
    "the source terms , @xmath35 , include the interaction rates of neutrinos with the gas by emission , absorption , and scattering reactions ; we use a reduced set of processes , viz .",
    "1 .   emission and absorption of electron neutrinos by neutrons , 2 .",
    "emission and absorption of electron anti - neutrinos by protons , 3",
    ".   elastic scattering of all neutrinos off nucleons , 4 .",
    "emission and absorption of electron neutrinos by heavy nuclei , 5 .",
    "coherent elastic scattering of all neutrinos off heavy nuclei , 6 .",
    "inelastic scattering of neutrinos off electrons and positrons .    in our implementation of these processes",
    ", we follow @xcite . due to their stiffness , we solve these source terms implicitly and split them off from the other parts of the conservation equations by an operator - split step .    despite the simplified treatment of neutrino - matter interactions , in the context of the questions focussed on in this paper ,",
    "the scheme provides a reasonably good representation of the neutrino effects that play a role during core collapse , bounce , shock propagation and in the accretion layer behind the stalled supernova shock .",
    "moreover , it is a computationally efficient treatment of the neutrino transport , and two - dimensional simulations up to several hundred milliseconds after bounce are well feasible .    furthermore , fluid - velocity dependent effects such as the @xmath36 work associated with diverging flows appear in the equations as well .",
    "to close the system of moment equations , we have to specify the tensor of the second moment , @xmath37 , for which we employ the maximum - entropy closure due to @xcite . using a tensorial generalisation of a one - dimensional _ eddington factor _ , our method is generically multi - dimensional .",
    "we note that our set of equations goes beyond the usual diffusion ansatz , in which the system of moment equations is truncated at the level of the energy equation and closed by expressing the flux in terms of the gradient of the energy density , mostly connecting diffusion and free - streaming limits by a flux limiter . retaining the first two moment equations , our scheme leads to a hyperbolic system , which can be solved by common methods such as high - resolution shock - capturing methods .    in the models presented here ,",
    "we include only electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos and neglect pair processes and muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "this simplification affects to a certain degree the cooling of the pns , and hence its contraction .",
    "although this effect modifies the surrounding layers where much of the field amplification takes place , these modifications are not sufficiently strong to change our main results concerning the processes relevant for field amplification beyond the level of quantitative corrections .",
    "we expect the corrections to be of a similar magnitude as the ones due to other uncertainties that affect the pns cooling such as the possibility of a stiffer nuclear equation of state .",
    "the `` stiffness '' of the neutron - star eos and the corresponding faster or slower contraction of the pns can , however , have a decisive influence on the development of an explosion , which is favoured or develops faster for a soft eos with more compact pns @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is therefore not the determination of explosion conditions of 2d stellar cores with magnetic fields in the most `` realistic '' manner ( also the simplifications applied in our treatment of neutrino interactions would conflict with such an aim ) but the assessment of field amplification mechanisms and of the influence of strong fields on the development of an explosion in comparison to the non - magnetic case .",
    ". for simplicity , only one quadrant is shown . ]",
    "the main purpose of our simulations is the differential analysis of the effects of variations of the initial magnetic field on the collapse and post - bounce evolution of a stellar core until explosion when otherwise all parameters are kept equal .",
    "we select the core of a star of 15.0 @xmath0 @xcite and map the pre - collapse model to a grid of @xmath38 zones . in the axisymmetric simulations ,",
    "@xmath39 lateral zones were distributed uniformly in @xmath9 between the north and south pole . up to a radius of @xmath40 ,",
    "the radial grid was uniform with a grid width of @xmath41 . for higher",
    "radii , the grid width was set to @xmath42 , resulting in an aspect ratio close to unity for grid cells .",
    "the outer radius of the grid was @xmath43 . at a radius of @xmath44 ,",
    "the grid width is @xmath45 .",

    "we discretise the energy dependence of the neutrino distribution function with @xmath47 energy bins .",
    "the first zone of the energy grid covers the energy range @xmath48 $ ] , and the grid width of the other 15 zones is given by @xmath49 .",
    "the grid extends to a maximum energy of @xmath50 .",
    "the topology of the magnetic field at the onset of collapse is highly uncertain . on the main sequence , field amplification by ,",
    "e.g. ,  gradual contraction of the star or convection competes with the loss of magnetic energy in stellar winds and in work the magnetic field does by exerting torques on the stellar matter . in the absence of rotation",
    ", stars lack an important ingredient of most large - scale dynamos .",
    "in such a case , they may be dominated by a small - scale turbulent field rather than a large - scale field .",
    "nevertheless , we assume a simple initial field , viz .  a modified dipole ( fig.[fig : b - init ] ) .",
    "while this may not be the most likely field configuration in real stellar cores ( though it resembles the poloidal component of the field topology found by @xcite simulating the magnetohydrodynamics of stellar interiors ) , it represents a favourable configuration for the alfvn - wave amplification mechanism we are interested in because of the large , coherent radial component allowing for the radial propagation of alfvn  waves .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the field is replaced by a more complex small - scale field in the regions of the core affected by hydrodynamic instabilities such as convection and the sasi .",
    "hence , we deem the influence of such an artificial choice for the initial field on our results not crucial .",
    "the field is the same as the one used by @xcite , defined by a vector potential of the form @xmath51 we set the normalisation radius @xmath52 defining the location of the dipole to @xmath53 and vary the parameter @xmath54 setting the field at the centre of the core to values between @xmath55 and @xmath56 g , i.e.  in a range considerably above that found by @xcite for rotating progenitors .",
    "in particular the strongest initial fields can , thus , not be representative for typical pre - collapse cores .",
    "the models are called ` bb ` , where the number @xmath57 is the decadic logarithm of @xmath54 .",
    "fig.[fig : b - init ] displays the initial field of model ` b10 ` . for comparison",
    ", we also performed simulations of a non - magnetic model in spherical symmetry as well as axisymmetry ( models ` s15 - 15 ` and ` b0 ` , respectively ) .",
    "we assume open boundary conditions at the outer radius of our grid .",
    "there we extrapolate the mass density and the radial velocity of the gas in such a way that the mass accretion rate in the ghost zones , @xmath58 , varies linearly with radius .",
    "we start the presentation of the simulation results with a description of the evolution of models without magnetic fields in spherical symmetry and axisymmetry , models ` s15 - 1d ` and ` b0 ` , respectively .",
    "they serve us as reference cases to which we will compare the results of the two - dimensional magnetised models .",
    "furthermore , they allow for a comparison to existing simulations that use more accurate treatments of neutrino interactions .",
    "we have performed a spherically symmetric ( 1d ) simulation of the same @xmath59 progenitor star that we employ for the rest of the models in our paper .",
    "this simulation shows an overall qualitative ( and in many aspects good quantitative ) agreement with results obtained with more sophisticated neutrino - transport schemes and including all neutrino flavours .",
    "a detailed comparison will be provided by just et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "as expected , the spherically symmetric model does not yield a successful sn explosion .",
    "instead , the core collapses after @xmath60 of post - bounce accretion .",
    "we note that we can not treat the evolution of this final collapse stage within the framework of our pseudo - relativistic treatment of gravity , but all diagnostic parameters indicate the onset black - hole formation , driven by continued accretion of collapsing stellar matter .",
    "deviations from spherical symmetry start to show up in the axisymmetric version of the non - magnetic model , ` b0 ` , after bounce .",
    "we display the time evolution of angularly averaged specific entropy and lateral velocity in mass - shell plots in fig.[fig : b0-mshell ] .",
    "the angular averages of the absolute value of the non - radial velocity , visible in the bottom half , indicate where hydrodynamic instabilities develop .",
    "two potentially unstable regions appear very clearly :    1 .",
    "convective instability inside the pns is limited in many simulations to a region below the neutrinospheres ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these simulations ,",
    "convection basically develops only where the ledoux - criterion for instability is fulfilled .",
    "although the ledoux - unstable region has a very similar shape in our model , non - radial mass motions are not limited to this region in our case , but cover basically the entire outer layers of the pns , from a density of @xmath61 to the neutrinospheres .",
    "this peculiar difference is most likely a consequence of the omission of @xmath62 and @xmath63 neutrinos . we take it as a matter of fact and",
    "will mainly discuss how the unstable region reacts to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the so - called hot - bubble region behind the stalled shock wave exhibits unstable flows due to convection and the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) .",
    "the relative importance of these two instabilities is currently a matter of intense investigations ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in the case of the instability inside the pns , a closer discussion of this problem is not the topic of our work , but we focus on the magnetic field amplification associated with these non - radial flows .",
    "non - radial mass motions in the gain layer cause shock deformations and oscillations on a moderate scale . for a long time , the minimum , mean , and maximum shock radii follow the trend of the spherical model and recede gradually .",
    "the first @xmath64 after bounce are characterised by oscillations of the shape of the shock ( measured , e.g.  by the difference between minimum and maximum shock radius ) . later",
    ", shock recession comes to a halt .",
    "the minimum and average shock radius never decrease below 100 km , and expand after @xmath65 . at this point , the post - shock instabilities and shock oscillations start to become more violent again .",
    "the shock adopts an increasingly bipolar form .",
    "finally , it expands , and a successful explosion sets in .",
    "since this reduces the mass accretion onto the pns , it does not undergo collapse as in the spherical version of the model .",
    "we note that the exact time of the onset of explosion will certainly depend on the detailed shock oscillations that develop in the phase of shock expansion and , thus , will have a stochastic nature .",
    "our results for this model should be understood in the same spirit as the spherical model , i.e.  as a reference point for the following discussion of the magnetic models and not as a detailed investigation of the physics of the hydrodynamic instabilities and the neutrino physics .",
    "irrespective of its cause , physical or as a result of our approximations , we take advantage of the long delay until the explosion sets in , because it allows us to follow the evolution of the magnetic field for a long time before the post - shock flows are disrupted .",
    "thus we may identify magnetic effects that might be suppressed in a model exploding earlier , e.g.  due to neutrino heating .",
    "based on this dynamical evolution , we introduce for further reference the following regions commonly used in ccsn theory :    _ ihsp _ : : :    the _ inner hydrodynamically stable pns",
    "_ extends from the origin to    roughly the radius where the density of the gas drops below    @xmath66 .",
    "_ pcnv _ : : :    this inner core is surrounded by the _ pns convection zone _ ,    characterised by a negative gradient of the electron fraction and a    flat or slightly negative entropy gradient .",
    "the outer boundary of this    layer is associated with the location of the minimum of the    @xmath67 profile .",
    "_ cool _ : : :    in the _ cooling layer _ outside the pns convection zone , the accreted    matter suffers a net energy loss due to the production of neutrinos .    at its bottom",
    ", the flow is decelerated and settles onto a stable layer    on the `` surface '' of the pns .",
    "_ gain _ : : :    the _ gain region _ is stirred by hot - bubble convection and sasi    activity . the gain radius , which defines the transition from neutrino    cooling below to neutrino heating above , coincides approximately with    the upper boundary of the stable layer . because of neutrino heating ,    the gain layer develops a negative entropy gradient and thus postshock    convection .",
    "the sasi activity , however , takes place in a larger    volume , encompassing parts of the neutrino - cooling layer as well .",
    "sasi    modes are amplified between the shock as an outer boundary and an    inner boundary layer , where the accretion flow gets decelerated ( see ,    e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this happens typically between neutrinosphere and    gain radius .",
    "furthermore , convective overshooting may extend to    regions below the gain radius .    unless stated otherwise , we define these regions based on angularly averaged profiles .",
    "the resulting radii separating the four regions are therefore only an approximate representation of the more complex two - dimensional borders of the regions .",
    "for instance , convective overshooting in the _ cool _ region leads to rather high non - radial kinetic energies also below the average gain radius .",
    "models ` b08 ` , ` b10 ` and ` b11 ` ( @xmath68 , respectively ) exhibit very similar dynamics compared both to each other and to the non - magnetised reference model .",
    "we will focus in the discussion on model ` b10 ` .",
    "we simulated model ` b10 ` until a post - bounce time @xmath69 .",
    "the structure of the core during the post - bounce evolution is the same as that of model ` b0 ` shown in fig.[fig : b0-mshell ] .",
    "we will present the discussion of the evolution of the magnetic field in the regions introduced above in the following .",
    "the regions inside of the pns ( regions _ ihsp _ , _ pcnv _ , and _ cool _ ) are visible in fig.[fig : b10-pns - mshell ] , and the time evolution of the angular average values of the alfvn  ( solid lines ) and flow speeds ( dashed lines ) in these regions is displayed in the _ top _ panel of fig.[fig : b10-pns - b - tevo ] .",
    "accretion of matter ( cf .",
    "the grey trajectories of angularly averaged mass shells in fig.[fig : b10-pns - mshell ] ) leads to an increasing mass of the pns and partially powers the neutrino emission .",
    "the pns ( for which we take the iso - density line @xmath70 as a proxy ) contracts to a radius around @xmath71 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the extent and intensity of the hydrodynamically unstable flows inside the pns is the same as in the non - magnetic model , i.e.  we do not find a notable influence of the magnetic field on the hydrodynamics .",
    "consequently , the average field strength in the _ ihsp _ region is basically constant ; see the black line in fig.[fig : b10-pns - b - tevo ] ( _ top _ ) - the increase after @xmath72 is not caused by field amplification in this region , but by a slow transport of magnetic energy across the iso - density surface of @xmath73g@xmath74 from the convectively active region .    overturning motions in the convectively unstable region , on the other hand , have a strong effect on the magnetic field .",
    "snapshots forming a time series of the first @xmath75 of the evolution of the pns are displayed in fig.[fig : b10-pns - ye - bfield-1 ] .",
    "the innermost @xmath76 are stable with velocities remaining close to zero there , and the magnetic field retains its initial topology . outside of this radius ,",
    "a few large convective rolls develop consisting of upflows of high ( blue ) and downflows of low ( red ) @xmath67 and entropy .",
    "they twist and stretch the magnetic field lines and amplify the field in region _",
    "pcnv _ until a stationary level is reached .",
    "the solid green line with diamonds in the _ top _ panel of fig.[fig : b10-pns - b - tevo ] presents a volume average of the alfvn  speed , @xmath77 , defined as @xmath78 the steep early rise before @xmath79 is a geometric effect as the _ pcnv _ is established .",
    "afterwards , the mean field increases moderately and levels off at a value around @xmath80 , where @xmath81 represent the ( volume ) average . ] , corresponding to an alfvn  speed of a few times @xmath82 .    in principle , a natural scale for the final magnetic energy achieved by convective field amplification could be set by the kinetic energy of the convective rolls . in our model",
    ", however , the magnetic energy falls short of this upper limit by about two orders of magnitude : the alfvn  speed is at least an order of magnitude lower than the flow speed .",
    "this shortfall coincides with a particular geometry of the field : the field is rather weak in the interior of the convective region , but strong in its upper and lower boundaries layers , as can be seen in the profiles of the _ bottom _ panel of fig.[fig : b10-pns - b - tevo ] and the upper part of fig.[fig : b10-pns - mshell ] . inside the convective region _",
    "pcnv _ , a profile of the r.m.s .",
    "field strength roughly @xmath83 is established at late times .",
    "the power of the profile decreases considerably , i.e.  convection does not lead to field amplification , or , at least , is unable to compensate the loss of magnetic flux from this region due to losses across the boundary of the convective layer and resistive dissipation and diffusion , leading to a field far from equipartition with the kinetic energy .",
    "although our simulations are run in ideal mhd , i.e.  without an explicit physical resistivity , inevitably the numerical discretisation leads to errors which can behave similarly to a physical resistivity ( for a thorough discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "we find strong indications for the influence of numerical resistivity in the development of closed magnetic field lines in the interior of these overturning cells ( e.g.  around @xmath84 in panel _ ( d ) _ of fig.[fig : b10-pns - ye - bfield-1 ] ) .",

    "though the agreement is not overwhelming , we find that the time - scale criterion reproduces the order of magnitude and the trends reasonably well . the amplification time is longer than the estimates @xmath136 ( dashed lines ) , because the actual efficiency of amplification is reduced by the advection through the gain layer . during the entire post - bounce evolution",

    "hence , our models allow for a fairly reliable assessment of the main mhd effects in self - consistent sn core models in the presence of all basic dynamical features found in supernova simulations , e.g.  the stagnation of the prompt shock wave , pns and hot - bubble convection , and the sasi activity .",
    "we will discuss remaining major limitations below .",
    "the principal results of our simulations and the main conclusions to be drawn from them are :    1 .",
    "non - magnetic and weakly magnetised models were followed for a post - bounce evolution of about 800 ms , during which the shock exhibits different phases of more or less regular oscillations of its dipole mode , corresponding to post - shock flows dominated by the sasi or convection .",
    "the mean shock radius contracts to values slightly above 100 km , until it starts to expand again and , finally , reaches more than 1000 km , at which point we stopped the simulations .",
    "similar to the results of @xcite and @xcite , this transition to explosion can be characterised by the development of one large bubble of high entropy . in agreement with @xcite , we find that this corresponds to a pronounced widening of the distribution of volume - filling factors of the relative entropy contrast .",
    "the magnetic field is amplified kinematically by the turbulent flows developing due to convection and the sasi .",
    "the amplification factor does not depend on the initial field unless it reaches , starting from a high initial value , equipartition with the kinetic energy and thus the maximum possible energy that can be attained .",
    "the maximum field we observe locally is a few times @xmath252 at the base of the pns convection layer . in the pns convection zone , the magnetic field",
    "is transiently amplified by the overturning flow , but suffers losses due to the expulsion of magnetic flux from convection cells . as a consequence , the pns is surrounded by a layer of strong field mostly parallel to its surface . if no changes of the magnetic topology occur as the pns cools and our 2d results can be confirmed by 3d simulations , the neutron star formed in the explosion will be magnetically shielded , in contrast to what is usually assumed in models of structure , cooling , and evolution of neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such a geometry might have important consequences for accretion on the pns and it might open up the possibility of powering explosive events in the magnetosphere triggered by impulsive reconnection .",
    "furthermore , it is similar to the field configurations used by by @xcite to explain the thermal luminosity of isolated neutron stars .",
    "when falling through the non - spherical accretion shock , the magnetic field is bent by lateral flows , creating a component parallel to the shock .",
    "these structures are advected towards the pns convection zone .",
    "the field accumulates there , leading to a layer of strong magnetic fields .",
    "since the structures are associated with a strong lateral component of the field , this layer is dominated by the @xmath9-component of the field .",
    "we find that the field amplification achieved by the turbulent flows is the result of the competition between the radial advection and the overturning flows and , hence , the growth of the field is connected to the ratio of the advection time scale to the time scale of eddy turnover .",
    "the field carried by a fluid element can only be amplified as long as the fluid parcel is inside the region of vortex motion .",
    "hence , fast turbulent flows in a slowly accreting layer are most conducive to field amplification .",
    "this effect , rather than the feedback of a magnetic field amplified to equipartition with the flow , sets the maximum to the field strength that our models with weak initial fields can reach .",
    "in fact , the final fields remain far below the kinetic energy across the entire spectrum of modes .",
    "4 .   due to the non - radial field geometry ,",
    "alfvn  waves propagate at constant radius rather than upwards .",
    "therefore , we do not find an alfvn  surface in the accretion flow , although there are sub- as well as superalfvnic regions in this layer .",
    "this limits the efficiency of the amplification mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "conditions for the latter effect are more favourable if accretion occurs through a sufficiently steady columns . in our axisymmetric models , this is the case mostly along the polar axis where the geometry enforces radial fields and flows .",
    "an alfvn  surface forms in the radial field of the accretion column at a radius depending on the initial field strength . for fields of @xmath253",
    "initially , we observe that perturbations created in the pns convection zone propagate along the field upwards into the accretion column , but a clear identification of their contribution to the amplification of the field and the energy transport was not possible",
    ". 5 .   for the strongest initial field , @xmath254 ,",
    "the combined kinetic and magnetic energies and stresses in the post - shock layer are similar to the ones for weak initial fields , but the contributions of magnetic and kinetic terms are now roughly equal . consequently , the field is able to shape the post - shock flow .",
    "the alfvn  speed equals the flow speed , and thus magnetic forces couple large volumes and favour the formation of a flow dominated by low - order multipole modes , viz .  a quadrupolar pattern of accretion columns at the poles and near the equator .",
    "furthermore , magnetic tension suppresses the disruption of these flow structures .",
    "consequently , the shock oscillations of this model show an extraordinary regularity , large amplitudes , and a low frequency . in this model with its special flow topology",
    ", we find the most pronounced shock expansion of all models , setting in @xmath255 earlier than for weak fields .",
    "similar to non - magnetic models , the explosion geometry is dominated by large high - entropy bubbles , but in contrast to the weak - field case , these bubbles are seeded by the low - order modes enforced by the magnetic field rather than slowly developing from the convective / sasi modes .",
    "strong initial fields in the progenitor core of @xmath256 thus favour an earlier onset of the explosion .    though limited to non - rotating models in axisymmetry ,",
    "our study is similar in scope to that of @xcite , and our main results are in agreement with theirs .",
    "we find , consistent with their results , efficient amplification of the magnetic field in the unstable regions of the hot bubble and the pns , and , in particular , along the symmetry axis , where the flow is forced into stable , narrow accretion columns .",
    "furthermore , all pre - collapse initial fields weaker than @xmath257 are amplified by roughly the same average factor in our models , while dynamic backreaction limits the amplification of stronger initial fields to smaller average factors .",
    "this threshold of the pre - collapse field strength above which the amplification is limited by feedback corresponds to field strength at the surface of the pns similar to the one reported by @xcite ( cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "having in mind the dependence of the field growth rate on the ratio between advection and eddy - turnover times , we may speculate that the different factors of magnetic field growth in their and our models are caused by strongly different sizes of the gain layers and different accretion profiles .",
    "besides many similar aspects , we have to note a striking difference between our results and the ones by @xcite : they find a complete suppression of the sasi by their strongest magnetic field , while in our models , the sasi is able to operate even for the strongest initial fields , albeit with a modified geometry . among the differences in the setup of the two sets of simulations ,",
    "the one most likely cause of such a strong discrepancy may be the chosen initial geometry of the magnetic field .",
    "while @xcite start with a strictly radial field ( split monopole ) , our initial fields are generated by an off - centre dipole and , thus , have strong non - radial components .",
    "studies of the evolution of the sasi in a magnetised medium by @xcite and @xcite show that the interaction between the magnetic field and the sasi modes entails stabilising as well as destabilising effects , but their relative importance depends on the field geometry .",
    "the destabilising effects are strongest for a non - radial field and absent for a radial field .",
    "this indicates a possible origin of the differences between our simulations and those by @xcite , although this issue requires a closer investigation .    in summary",
    ", our results suggest that magnetic field amplification to interesting strengths can efficiently take place during stellar core collapse even in the absence of rotation .",
    "in addition to an enhancement due to compression by the radial collapse , we find that non - radial fluid flows associated with convection and sasi activity , and the interaction of alfvn  waves in the accretion funnels can amplify the initial iron - core fields .",
    "present stellar evolution models @xcite predict a field strength in slowly rotating pre - collapse iron cores of the order of @xmath258@xmath259 g and a predominantly toroidal field geometry . because a large - scale dynamo is less likely to operate inside a non - rotating core",
    ", cores should generically possess even weaker and less ordered fields in the limit of very slow rotation than for rapid rotation .",
    "starting with fields of the mentioned strength as an upper limit , field strengths of typical pulsars ( @xmath56@xmath7 g ) can be reached .",
    "magnetar fields of @xmath260@xmath8 g result when the progenitor core is assumed to posses a pre - collapse field between a few @xmath261 g and @xmath56 g . only in the latter case ,",
    "the fields around the nascent neutron star obtain dynamical importance and might have an influence on the supernova explosion mechanism .",
    "though offering some insight into the magnetic - field evolution in non - rotating magnetised cores , our study has several important shortcomings :    1 .   we have used a new solver for the neutrino transport with simplified neutrino - matter interactions , constraining ourselves to electron neutrinos and antineutrinos . while the accuracy of such a simplification in comparison to more complete neutrino treatments will have to be assessed in a separate study , we do not deem this a problem for the presented investigation because we are able to capture the most important dynamical effects in a supernova core .",
    "2 .   to save computational costs ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves to axisymmetric simulations . in the light of the anti - dynamo theorems ,",
    "this is a severe limitation leading to a wrong , possibly too low , level of amplification of the field in the turbulent regions .",
    "furthermore , our models do not allow for the development of shear layers associated with non - axisymmetric spiral modes of the sasi , which may also be a site of efficient amplification of the magnetic field ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   axisymmetry may also affect the amount to which the magnetic flux is expelled from the pns convection zone .",
    "moreover , axisymmetry restricts the dynamics of the accretion flows , favouring the development of very stable accretion columns along the poles .",
    "as we have described , field amplification shows very distinct features in and below these columns .",
    "we presume that the dynamics in three dimensions is more similar to what we have seen in off - axis accretion flows , i.e.  less stable alfvn  surfaces and less efficient amplification of alfvn  waves .",
    "very strong initial fields of the order of @xmath254 lead to high field strengths that are able to dominate the post - shock accretion flow .",
    "this might establish coherent , stable accretion columns even in 3d .",
    "for such fields , our axisymmetric results may hence be a reasonable approximation .",
    "5 .   turbulent field amplification may be very sensitive to dissipation effects , physical and numerical .",
    "our models , based on _ ideal _ mhd , neglect dissipation by physical viscosity and resistivity , but are computed on relatively coarse numerical grids , corresponding to excessive numerical dissipation .",
    "this is at least partially confirmed by a resimulation of one of our weak - field models on a grid with twice the standard resolution , which shows a magnetic energy in the gain layer twice as large as in the standard model , whereas most other variables change only weakly .",
    "6 .   therefore , we are not able to fully resolve the turbulent ( inverse ) cascades of magnetic and kinetic energy and helicity covering many orders of magnitude in wave number in a supernova core .",
    "the effect of insufficient resolution on alfvn  waves is probably less serious although their wave number should increase as they approach the alfvn  point , requiring enhanced resolution .",
    "simulations of cores at a resolution corresponding to numerical viscosity and resistivity below the physical scales of these dissipative effects are by far too expensive today , and will remain so for a long time . to tackle this difficulty ,",
    "a combination of different approaches would be desirable , viz .",

    "<S> we study the amplification of magnetic fields in the collapse and the post - bounce evolution of the core of a non - rotating star of 15 @xmath0 in axisymmetry . to this end , we solve the coupled equations of magnetohydrodynamics and neutrino transport in the two - moment approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - collapse magnetic field is strongly amplified by compression in the infall . </S>",

    "<S> consequently , the resulting amplification factor of order five is the result of the number of small - eddy turnovers taking place within the time scale of advection through the post - shock layer . due to this limit </S>",
    "<S> , most of our models do not reach equipartition between kinetic and magnetic energy and , consequently , evolve similarly to the non - magnetic case , exploding after about 800 ms when a single or few high - entropy bubbles persist over several dynamical time scales . in the model with the strongest initial field we studied , @xmath2 , for which equipartition between flow and field is achieved </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic tension favours a much earlier development of such long - lived high - entropy bubbles and enforces a fairly ordered large - scale flow pattern . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this model , after exhibiting very regular shock oscillations , explodes much earlier than non - magnetic ones .    </S>",
