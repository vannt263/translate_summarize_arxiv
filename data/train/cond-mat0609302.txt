    "as it was shown by meyer _ at al . _ in 1975  @xcite , the origin of ferroelectric ordering in smectic - c@xmath3  ( sm - c@xmath3 ) liquid crystals with the spontaneous polarization normal to the tilt plane is closely related to the reduction of symmetry caused by chirality of the tilted sm - c@xmath3  phase .",
    "this phase is thus naturally ferroelectric and the sm - c@xmath3  liquid crystals are also known as the _ ferroelectric liquid crystals _ ( flc ) ( a detailed description of flcs can be found e.g. in a collection of reviews  @xcite and in a more recent monograph  @xcite ) .    over the past three decades flcs",
    "have been attracted considerable attention not only as a vital issue in the condensed matter physics but also as promising materials for applications in electro - optic switching devices .",
    "the first such device was due to clark and lagerwall  @xcite .",
    "they studied electro - optic response of flc cells confined between two parallel plates subject to homogeneous boundary conditions and made thin enough to suppress the bulk chiral sm - c@xmath3   helix .",
    "it was found that such cells    the so - called _ surface - stabilized ferroelectric liquid - crystal _ ( ssflc ) cells    exhibit high - speed , bistable electro - optical switching between orientational states stabilized by surface interactions .",
    "the response of chiral sm - c@xmath3   liquid crystals to an applied electric field is characterized by fast switching times due to linear coupling between the field and the spontaneous polarization .",
    "there is also a threshold voltage necessary for switching to occur and the process of bistable switching is typically accompanied by a hysteresis .",
    "the switching times and the threshold voltages may considerably vary depending on the wave form , the amplitude and the frequency of applied ( driving ) voltages .    in early studies",
    "@xcite , it was found that the competition between elastic , electrostatic and surface energies may result in different regimes of switching and field induced transitions in flc cells .",
    "certain regimes such as the high voltage regime can be described using the theoretical approach based on the assumption that director and polarization fields are spatially homogeneous .",
    "this approach provides uniform switching models where the effects of electrostatic and surface interactions are incorporated into an effective potential governing the dynamics of switching .",
    "such models can be readily applied to interpret experimental data .    in particular , the uniform model of switching supplemented with an elastic - like term was examined in  @xcite as a useful tool to describe experimental behavior of the polarization reversal current in ssflc cells .",
    "similarly , the uniform theory was applied to determine the rotational viscosity and the anchoring energy strength from the experimental results on the response time measured as a function of pulse voltage in ssflc cell  @xcite .",
    "the field - reversal method suggested in  @xcite to measure the spontaneous polarization , the switching time , the rotational viscosity and the dc conductivity also relies on the uniform model .",
    "( recent discussions , applications and generalizations of uniform models can be found e.g. in  @xcite . )    in this paper we are aimed to study the effects of surface anchoring energy in switching dynamics of asymmetric ssflc cells where nonidentical aligning films impose different boundary conditions at the substrates .",
    "the effect of our particular concern is the frequency dependent shift of the hysteresis loop observed in our experiments .    in the theoretical part of the paper ,",
    "we adapt a systematic approach and examine predictions of the uniform theory where the effects of asymmetry are caused by the polar contribution to the anchoring energy potential .",
    "the voltage thresholds in relation to the driving frequency are studied by using the method suggested to explore the properties of periodic solutions to the dynamical equation .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we derive the effective potential and formulate the model .",
    "the simplified case with the anchoring energy neglected is discussed so as to clarify the assumptions taken to obtain frequency dependent threshold voltages .",
    "analysis of the switching dynamics is performed in sec .",
    "[ sec : switch - dyn ] .",
    "we present the approach that uses the parameterized half - period mappings for the approximate model to study the time - periodic solutions of the dynamical equation .",
    "these solutions are called the cycles and related to the fixed points of the composition of the half - period mappings .",
    "the method is applied to the case of square wave voltages .",
    "analytical relations for the conditions of complete switching , the switching times and the critical frequency bounding the region of cycles from above are obtained . for sine - wave and triangular voltages ,",
    "we comment on the numerical procedure and show that , qualitatively , the results remain unchanged .    experimental details and the results of electro - optical measurements for the switching voltage thresholds are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : experim ] . the experimental data and the theoretical results of sec .  [ sec : switch - dyn ] are used to model the process of switching and to estimate the polar anchoring parameter .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we present our results and make some concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    "we extend our analysis to the dynamical model with the double - well effective potential and study the branches of stable and unstable cycles .",
    "in this section we introduce necessary notations and describe the model that takes into account the effects due to aligning films .",
    "the equation of motion governing switching dynamics in asymmetric ssflc cells are derived and the asymmetry induced polar contribution to the anchoring energy is found to play an important part in the problem frequency dependence of the switching voltage thresholds is analyzed using a simplified model as an example demonstrating the key points underlying subsequent theoretical considerations .",
    "we consider the flc cell with a planar arrangement of planar smectic layers usually referred to as the _ bookshelf _ geometry .",
    "this geometry is schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bookshelf ] .",
    "it is characterized by the director field @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the molecular cone angle , @xmath6 is the azimuthal angle around the smectic cone , @xmath7 is the outward ( inward ) normal to the upper ( lower ) substrate of flc cell , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 is the cell thickness .",
    "the vector of the polarization , @xmath11 , and the electric field inside the cell , @xmath12 , are given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization .",
    "the external driving voltage @xmath15 is characterized by the amplitude @xmath16 , the frequency @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the period ) and the @xmath18-periodic function of time @xmath19 describing the waveform of the applied voltage .    for sinusoidal ( sine - wave ) driving voltages , the waveform function @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 whereas @xmath18-periodic continuations of the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 give the waveform functions for the triangular and square - wave forms , respectively .",
    "similar to nematic liquid crystals ( nlc ) , when a flc layer is brought into contact with aligning substrates , the energy of the flc molecules in the interfacial layer and thus the surface tension will be orientationally dependent .",
    "the anisotropic part of the surface tension    the so - called _ anchoring energy _    gives rise to the phenomenon known as _ anchoring _",
    ", i.e. , surface induced alignment of the flc director along the vector of preferential orientation referred to as the _",
    "easy axis_.    phenomenologically , the expression for the anchoring energy can be written as a linear combination of the invariants constructed from the surface normal , @xmath7 , the flc director , @xmath24 and the unit polarization vector @xmath25 . for flc cells ,",
    "this gives the anchoring energy expressed in terms of the scalar products @xmath26 and @xmath27 as follows @xmath28_{y=\\nu d/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) is the strength of nonpolar anchoring at the upper ( lower ) substrate ; similarly , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the polar anchoring strength at the upper and lower substrate , respectively .",
    "the first term in square brackets on the right hand side of eq .   represents the rapini - papoular surface potential  @xcite preserving equivalence between @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "this equivalence , however , can be broken due to effects of polar ordering in the interfacial layer  @xcite .    as opposed to the case of nematic liquid crystals , where the effects of surface induced polarity are mainly caused by the quadrupole - dipole interaction  @xcite",
    ", one might expect that in flcs the dominating factor is the electrostatic interaction of the spontaneous polarization @xmath11 with the surface charges or dipoles .",
    "so , the polar anchoring term on the right hand side of eq .   is taken to be proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "this term introduces dependence on the polarity of the polarization resulting from the ferroelectric polar surface interaction .",
    "when the director field   is spatially homogeneous , the anchoring energy   takes the simplified form @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . from eq .",
    "it is seen that , for symmetric cells with @xmath38 , the polar terms add to zero . in asymmetric flc cells , the _ polar anchoring parameter _ ,",
    "@xmath39 , is generally non - vanishing .    in figure",
    "[ fig : poten - phi ] , the potential   is plotted in relation to the azimuthal angle @xmath6 .",
    "it is illustrated that there are two local minima : @xmath40 ( the up state with @xmath41 ) and @xmath42 ( the down state with @xmath43 ) .",
    "when @xmath44 , the minima are not energetically equivalent and one of the minima represents the metastable state .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to obtain the relation @xmath45 as the condition for the configurations with @xmath40 and @xmath42 to be metastable . if the metastability condition   is broken the anchoring potential has only one minimum .",
    "similar results were previously reported in refs .",
    "@xcite and the effects of asymmetry induced by the polar anchoring in switching dynamics will be of our primary concern . throughout the paper we shall assume that , in the zero - field case , the up and down states are both metastable and the condition   is satisfied .    in general ,",
    "the polar anchoring energy is known to be of considerable importance in the understanding of static and dynamical behavior of chiral smectics in confined geometries .",
    "for example , it may lead to the discontinuous fredericksz transitions  @xcite and is found to give rise to the surface electroclinic effect  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the polar anchoring strength was also estimated from the experimental data on the static dielectric susceptibility , the voltage coercivity and the relaxation time  @xcite .    in a more recent theoretical investigation  @xcite into the effects of polar anchoring , which induces ferroelectric ordering close to the bounding surfaces of an antiferroelectric liquid crystal cell , it was found that such ordering may result in a coexistence of multiple zero - voltage ground states .",
    "as far as the ssflc cells are concerned , the polar part of the anchoring energy was considered theoretically in the papers  @xcite dealing with the so - called `` thresholdless '' or `` v - shaped '' switching mode of the optical response to an applied voltage .",
    "it was found that monostable structures exhibiting the v - shaped switching can be formed as a result of the polarization charge self - interaction accompanied by the effects of the insulating alignment layers .    to see this",
    ", we briefly discuss a simple double - layer model .",
    "the starting point is the standard expression for the electrostatic part of the flc free energy per unit area @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the area of the substrates , @xmath48  fm@xmath49 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath50 is the flc dielectric tensor .    for flc sandwiched between two insulating layers , we neglect the conductivity of flc and use the boundary conditions for the normal component of the electric displacement field , @xmath51 , to obtain the relations @xmath52 where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the dielectric constant of the lower ( upper ) insulating layer and @xmath55 is the electric field inside the layers .",

    "we can now use eq .   to eliminate the electric fields , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , from the expression   and",
    "relate the electric displacement field to the external electric field , @xmath60 , as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",

    "can be simplified giving the relation @xmath64 recently obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of identical substrates .",
    "evidently , this relation implies that the electric field inside the flc layer , @xmath65 , deviates from the applied electric field , @xmath60 , due to the presence of the aligning substrates . as it was emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , this effect plays an important part in describing the v - shaped switching mode .    alternatively , eq .",

    "represents the energy of self - interacting polarization charges .",
    "now we neglect the dielectric anisotropy of flc , @xmath68 , and consider the energy @xmath69 defined as a sum of the effective and the anchoring energies . after substituting eqs .   and   into the energy  ,",
    "it can be seen that there are two effects caused by the aligning layers : ( a )  reduction of the applied electric field : @xmath70^{-1 } e_{0}$ ] , and ( b )  renormalization of the nonpolar anchoring strength induced by the polarization self - interaction : @xmath71^{-1 } \\varepsilon_0^{-1 } p_{{\\mathrm{s}}}^2 $ ] .",
    "the latter is the effect that may result in breaking the metastability condition   thus leading to the formation of monostable structures exhibiting the thresholdless switching  @xcite .",
    "since such a possibility as well as v - shaped switching is beyond the scope of this paper , we shall use the energy   without changing notations for the renormalized values of @xmath60 and @xmath72 .",
