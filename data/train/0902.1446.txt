    "one of the basic unsolved problems of dissipative quantum mechanics and quantum transport through mesoscopic systems is the nonequilibrium kondo model . in its simplest version ,",
    "it consists of a spin-@xmath1 system coupled via exchange processes to the spins of two fermionic reservoirs , which are kept at two different chemical potentials @xmath2 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo ] . besides the importance of the kondo model for many aspects of strongly correlated fermion systems ( see ref .   for an overview ) , it was suggested to realize this model in transport experiments through quantum dots.@xcite this has been achieved @xcite with the particular advantage of full control over all parameters such as temperature , voltage , magnetic field , and exchange couplings . the central idea is to lower temperature and bias voltage such that only one single - particle level of a quantum dot will contribute to transport .",
    "adjusting the gate voltage such that charge fluctuations of this level are suppressed ( coulomb blockade regime ) , the dot can either be occupied by a spin up or a spin down electron , and the spin can fluctuate via second - order cotunneling processes , leading precisely to the model depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kondo ] . in this realization ,",
    "one obtains an antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of the order @xmath3 ( in dimensionless units ) , where @xmath4 is the density of states in the reservoirs , @xmath5 denotes the tunneling amplitude ( hopping parameter ) between the leads and the dot , and @xmath6 is the energy of the virtual intermediate state ( charging energy ) .     quantum system coupled via exchange to two reservoirs . @xmath7 and @xmath8 involve exchange between the spins of the left / right reservoir with the local spin , and @xmath9 transfers a particle from one reservoir to the other during the exchange process . ]    in equilibrium ,",
    "the kondo model has been analyzed by various many - body methods ( for an overview , see ref .  ) and can be solved exactly by bethe ansatz @xcite or conformal field theory.@xcite powerful numerical techniques such as the numerical renormalization group have been developed @xcite from which all thermodynamic and spectral properties can be calculated .",
    "the basic physics can already be understood from poor man scaling arguments.@xcite if all exchange couplings are the same @xmath10 , one obtains the renormalization group ( rg ) equation @xmath11 with the solution @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the kondo temperature and @xmath14 denotes an effective exchange coupling corresponding to an effective band width @xmath15 of the reservoirs ( @xmath16 is the original band width ) . for the antiferromagnetic case @xmath17 ,",
    "one obtains an enhancement of the exchange coupling by reducing the effective band width until @xmath15 reaches @xmath13 , where @xmath14 diverges .",
    "this indicates a logarithmic enhancement of the linear conductance for temperatures above the kondo temperature ( weak - coupling regime ) , and a complete screening of the dot spin by the reservoir spins below @xmath13 ( strong - coupling regime ) . in the latter case",
    ", it can be shown that the conductance becomes unitary , i.e. , @xmath18 , at zero temperature @xmath19 and zero bias voltage @xmath20 .    in nonequilibrium",
    ", the kondo model is not yet solved completely .",
    "some numerical techniques have already been developed to describe either the time evolution of an out - of - equilibrium initial state by using time - dependent numerical renormalization group ( td - nrg ) ( ref .  ) or to describe the stationary current in the presence of a bias by using nrg in a scattering wave basis @xcite or using an iterative real - time path integral approach.@xcite scattering wave bethe ansatz methods based on the lippmann - schwinger equation are currently under way to solve the single - impurity anderson model in nonequilibrium.@xcite concerning analytical rg methods , it has been emphasized that it is important to understand how the rg equations are cut off by the bias voltage and by relaxation and dephasing rates.@xcite the problem can be stated as follows .",
    "performing perturbation theory in the bare exchange coupling @xmath21 ( disregarding for the moment the differences between @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ) , logarithmic terms occur , which , at zero temperature and depending on the physical observable under consideration , have the form [ we indicate only the order in the exchange coupling leaving out numbers of @xmath25 and other physical energy scales from @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the prefactor ] @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",

    "@xmath36 is the band width of the reservoirs and @xmath27 is the bare magnetic field .",
    "@xmath37 denotes the number of particles transferred between the reservoirs and @xmath31 characterizes whether spin flip processes occur or not .",
    "the points @xmath38 correspond to resonance positions , where certain higher - order processes are allowed by energy conservation , e.g. , the value @xmath39 corresponds to the onset of inelastic cotunneling processes.@xcite higher - order terms with @xmath40 have so far not been discussed in the literature for the kondo model , but are generically expected @xcite ( for other models in the charge fluctuation regime , corresponding terms have been calculated in ref .  ) . for given perturbation order @xmath41 , the allowed values for @xmath42 depend on the value of @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath43 it is known that @xmath44 . even in the weak - coupling regime @xmath45",
    "the logarithmic terms can lead to a breakdown of perturbation theory if @xmath46 is small enough such that @xmath47 . furthermore , at resonance @xmath38 , the logarithmic terms even diverge .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to resum the logarithmic terms in an appropriate way using rg and , at the same time , introduce the physics of relaxation and dephasing rates to cut off the divergencies at resonance .",
    "this idea has been proposed in ref .  .",
    "in a first step , within a standard poor man scaling approach , one resums all leading order logarithmic terms of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 depends on the physical observable under consideration [ see eq .",
    "( [ log_pert ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to an effective exchange coupling @xmath50 , given by eq .",
    "( [ solution_poor_man_scaling ] ) evaluated at @xmath51 : @xmath52 in a second step , one tries to expand the physical observable systematically in powers of the effective coupling constant @xmath50 , leading to a series with terms similiar to eq .",
    "( [ log_pert ] ) , but with the replacements @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if , in addition , one cuts off the resonances by an appropriate relaxation or dephasing rate @xmath55 , a new series of the form @xmath56 is expected , where @xmath57 is the renormalized magnetic field . as pointed out in ref .",
    "this perturbation series in @xmath50 is well - defined for @xmath58 , because the maximum value of the logarithm at resonance is given by @xmath59 , where we have used the rough estimate @xmath60 based on a simple dimensional analysis .",
    "therefore , at resonance , we expect terms of the form @xmath61 which are not dangerous since @xmath62 if @xmath58 ( note that @xmath63 ) .",
    "the leading order result is the term @xmath64 ( denoted as one - loop in this paper ) , whereas the first logarithmic correction @xmath65 is the first subleading term ( denoted as two - loop in this paper ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a well - defined two - loop rg approach to work out the above - described procedure .",
    "thereby we will apply a recently proposed real - time renormalization group method in frequency space ( rtrg - fs).@xcite this method has the advantage that formally exact rg equations can be set up in nonequilibrium which include the relaxation and dephasing rates in all resolvents appearing on the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of the rg equations .",
    "furthermore , in leading order , precisely poor man scaling equation ( [ poor_man_scaling ] ) is obtained .",
    "this provides the possibility to proceed in two steps : first one expands the exact rg equations systematically around the poor man scaling solution for @xmath66 , and , in the second step , one solves the rg equations perturbatively in @xmath50 for @xmath67 .",
    "as we will show in this paper , in both steps two - loop terms are important to obtain the first logarithmic corrections beyond leading order . in the first step , two - loop terms arising from higher - order terms on the r.h.s . of the rg equation",
    "generate terms @xmath68 which depend only weakly on the voltage and are incorporated into a redefinition of the coupling constant @xmath50 ( or , equivalently , the kondo temperature ) .",
    "these terms lead to an overall increase ( or decrease ) in the physical observable under consideration but show no interesting dependence on voltage or magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , in the second step , logarithmic contributions of form ( [ log_rg ] ) are generated which give rise to a logarithmic enhancement ( suppression ) at resonance .",
    "this means that the various two - loop terms ( leading all to terms of the same order of magnitude ) can be systematically divided into important and unimportant terms concerning their dependence on voltage and magnetic field . in accordance with results of refs .   and",
    ", we emphasize that it is very important to include the frequency dependence of the vertices generated from the first step @xmath66 since this influences the prefactor of the logarithmic contributions calculated in the second step @xmath69 .    in one - loop order ( but including certain two - loop terms from the frequency dependence of the vertices ) , the conductance and the magnetization have been calculated previously for the nonequilibrium kondo model .",
    "pioneering works are refs .   and  , where the slave particle approach was used in combination with the keldysh formalism and quantum boltzmann equations .",
    "the rg was formulated only on one part of the keldysh contour and a real - frequency cutoff was used . in these works , it was investigated how the voltage and the magnetic field cut off the rg flow and it was emphasized that the frequency dependence of the vertices is important to obtain the first logarithmic contributions beyond leading order . in fact , the result of the present paper concerning the conductance and the magnetization is precisely the same as that of refs .   and  , up to the redefinition of the kondo temperature .",
    "this means that we will prove in this paper that all two - loop contributions neglected in refs .   and   do not influence the prefactor of the first logarithmic correction beyond leading order . furthermore , in refs .   and",
    ", diagrams connecting the upper with the lower part of the keldysh contour have been neglected . within these works , it was therefore not possible to describe the cutoff of the logarithmic terms by relaxation and dephasing rates on a full microscopic level . in this paper",
    ", we will show how this can be achieved within rtrg - fs , which provides a consistent formalism to calculate the line shape at resonance and to see whether the spin relaxation rate @xmath70 or the spin dephasing rate @xmath71 cuts off the logarithmic divergencies ( in ref .",
    ", the latter question was adressed only in bare perturbation theory and zero magnetic field ) .",
    "in addition , in this paper we will also discuss the anisotropic case and calculate the spin relaxation / dephasing rates together with the renormalized @xmath0 factor up to the first logarithmic contribution ( corresponding to a three - loop calculation in conventional rg methods ) .",
    "besides the known reduction in the magnetic field in first order in @xmath14,@xcite we find that the renormalized magnetic field in second order in @xmath14 is proportional to logarithmic terms similiar to eq .",
    "( [ log_rg ] ) with a significant dependence on voltage and magnetic field .",
    "we propose an experimental setup with a weakly coupled third lead to measure the voltage dependence of the renormalized @xmath0 factor .",
    "moreover , we find that the logarithmic terms of @xmath71 and @xmath34 are controlled by @xmath70 , whereas those of @xmath70 are controlled by @xmath71 . in the anisotropic case",
    "this leads to the effect that the logarithmic resonances of @xmath72 become sharper with decreasing @xmath73 since @xmath70 does not contain any terms proportional to @xmath74 in second order . furthermore , we will show that the susceptibility depends only weakly on the tranverse coupling @xmath73 and the logarithmic resonances even survive in the limit @xmath75 .",
    "the anisotropic kondo model has recently been proposed to be realizable in low - temperature transport through single molecular magnets @xcite and experiments are starting to investigate such systems.@xcite since the transverse coupling is induced by small magnetic quantum tunneling terms , giving rise to rather small kondo temperatures , the susceptibility might be an interesting physical quantity to measure signatures of the kondo effect even for very small values of @xmath73 .    using flow equation methods,@xcite a consistent two - loop approach including the cutoff by spin relaxation / dephasing rates has been presented in ref .   for the isotropic kondo model in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "within this method , the cutoff from the rate @xmath55 occurs due to a competition of certain one - loop and two - loop terms on the r.h.s . of the rg equation for the vertex .",
    "this is a completely different picture compared to rtrg - fs , where the cutoff parameter @xmath55 together with the voltage occurs already in the one - loop terms as an additional term in the denominator of the resolvents .",
    "thus , the rtrg - fs method is closer to conventional poor man scaling and the physics of relaxation and dephasing rates occurs naturally as a resummation of a geometric series similiar to self - energy insertions in green s function techniques . in this sense",
    "the rtrg - fs method proves that conventional scaling equations ( properly generalized to the keldysh contour ) can account for the cutoff of the rg flow by rates and the voltage .",
    "furthermore , the rtrg - fs method provides a generic proof in all orders of perturbation theory in the renormalized vertices that the various cutoff scales @xmath76 are the physical relaxation and dephasing rates governing the time evolution of the reduced density matrix of the quantum system .",
    "the rtrg - fs method used in this paper has been proposed in ref .   and is a natural generalization of an earlier developed real - time rg method.@xcite as described in detail in ref .",
    ", many technical improvements have been incorporated , the main ones being a formulation of the rg in pure frequency space , integrating out the symmetric part of the fermi distribution function before starting the rg , and formulating the nonequilibrium rg on the imaginary frequency axis . as a consequence , the rates determining the cutoff of the rg flow",
    "obtain the right scale , and it is possible to show generically that relaxation and dephasing rates cut off the rg flow in all orders of perturbation theory and within all truncation schemes .",
    "furthermore , the dependence on the keldysh indices can be completely avoided , and one can calculate the time evolution and the nonequilibrium stationary state in pure matsubara space without the need of any analytic continuation .",
    "the latter idea has first been proposed in ref .   in the context of nonequilibrium functional renormalization group within the keldysh formalism .",
    "a particular advantage of the rtrg - fs method is that relaxation and dephasing rates occur naturally as the negative imaginary part of the eigenvalue of the kernel determining the kinetic equation of the reduced density matrix , and do not arise from more involved combinations of self - energies and vertex corrections as in slave particle formalism.@xcite furthermore , it is straightforward to calculate the time evolution from rtrg - fs since the rg gives directly the result for the kernel in laplace space .",
    "for generic problems with spin and/or orbital fluctuations , it was described in ref .   how to solve the rg equations analytically in the weak coupling regime up to one - loop order .",
    "in this paper we will provide the technically much more involved two - loop case , which is necessary to calculate consistently the important logarithmic terms at resonance discussed above , see eq .",
    "( [ log_rg ] ) .",
    "the result will be applied to the calculation of the conductance and the magnetic susceptibility of the anisotropic kondo model in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , we will also analyze quantities characterizing the time evolution of the kondo model .",
    "thereby , we will concentrate on the calculation of the dominant exponential decay of the magnetization in two - loop order , which is determined by the spin relaxation and dephasing rates @xmath77 and the renormalized magnetic field @xmath57 . finally , in addition to ref .",
    ", we will generically show that precisely these physical quantities control all resonant line shapes ( in ref .",

    "also the prefactors of the logarithmic terms depend on @xmath935 and therefore become smaller for growing @xmath921 .",
    "we have presented a systematic and analytic weak - coupling analysis in two - loop for a generic quantum dot coupled to reservoirs via spin or orbital fluctuations .",
    "we have used a nonequilibrium rg formalism in liouville space ( or , equivalently , on the keldysh contour ) , which is a natural and formally exact generalization of conventional poor man scaling methods .",
    "the essential difference between the rtrg - fs method and other rg formalisms in nonequilibrium @xcite is the fact that rtrg - fs analyzes the dynamics of the reduced dot density matrix in laplace space by calculating an effective dot liouvillian . in each step of the rg approach an effective kinetic equation",
    "is obtained .",
    "the rg equations are coupled differential equations for the kernel determining this kinetic equation and for the vertices in liouville space .",
    "the structure in liouville space is essential for the generation of dissipation and to obtain the _ transport _ relaxation and dephasing rates together with the _ transport _ oscillation frequencies of the various exponentially damped modes ( rather than quantities of quantum decay theory , which describe the decay of a discrete dot state into the reservoir continuum ) .",
    "technically , it is known from the keldysh formalism @xcite that dissipation ( or the collision term of a quantum boltzmann equation ) is generated by diagrams connecting the upper with the lower part of the keldysh contour .",
    "therefore , to get the correct transport rates and the precise position of resonances from the oscillation frequencies , it is essential to include these contributions in the theory and , at the same time , combine it with rg methods to get rid of logarithmic divergencies .",
    "we note that the rtrg - fs formalism is not based on the usual keldysh formalism as , e.g. , methods based on slave particles @xcite or nonequilibrium functional rg methods.@xcite since the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian contains strong interactions , the rtrg - fs integrates out only the noninteracting reservoirs but takes the correlation effects on the quantum dot exactly into account .",
    "this leads to a natural formalism in terms of liouville operators and vertices in liouville space , which we have combined with quantum field theoretical methods of diagrammatic representations and rg . in this sense",
    ", we have combined the advantages of liouville operator techniques ( providing very compact notations for the time evolution of the reduced density matrix in laplace space ) , diagrammatic methods ( to identify and calculate irreducible blocks leading to the oscillation frequencies and the relaxation / dephasing rates ) , and rg methods ( reorganizing the perturbation theory in such a way that logarithmic divergencies are absent ) . in particular , it is possible to prove generically in all orders of perturbation theory and within all truncation schemes that the cutoff scales for the vertices are the physical relaxation and dephasing rates of the exponentially decaying modes of the reduced density matrix of the dot .",
    "this provides a reliable calculation of the line shape at resonances .",
    "in addition , one obtains the kernel of the kinetic equation in laplace space from which the time evolution into the stationary state can be calculated .",
    "it is important to note that the possibility to calculate the time evolution is closely related to the fact that we obtain a systematic theory for the line shape at resonances , since the oscillation frequencies and the relaxation / dephasing rates governing the exponential decay of the _ time evolution _ are the _ same _ scales which determine the resonance positions and the cutoff of logarithmic divergencies at resonances for _ stationary _ quantities such as , e.g. , the magnetization or the conductance .    in comparism to previous formulations of rtrg ( refs .   ) ( where the physics of cutoff scales by relaxation / dephasing modes was also included ) , the recently proposed rtrg - fs method @xcite is a formulation in pure matsubara frequency space and avoids the need of the keldysh indices after a first discrete rg step where the symmetric part of the fermi distribution is integrated out .",
    "the main advantage of this development is the possibility to prove that the perturbation theory in the renormalized vertices on the r.h.s .",
    "of the rg equation is a well defined series in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "essential for this proof is the fact that the imaginary part of the denominators of all resolvents consists of a sum of strictly positive matsubara frequencies ( bounded from above by the cutoff ) , the cutoff scale @xmath15 , and some positive relaxation or dephasing rate @xmath185 . as a consequence , it is possible to solve the rg equations analytically in the weak - coupling regime by a systematic perturbative expansion in the renormalized couplings .",
    "in this paper , we have described this procedure for a generic quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime where spin and/or orbital fluctuations dominate the transport properties .",
    "we have included all two - loop contributions to calculate physical quantities up to the first logarithmic contribution at resonances .",
    "we have shown that the latter are well defined after renormalization and can be treated within perturbation theory in the renormalized couplings .",
    "we have applied the formalism to the anisotropic kondo model at finite magnetic field and finite bias voltage .",
    "we calculated stationary properties ( magnetic susceptibility and conductance ) and the parameters characterizing the exponentially damped modes of the time evolution ( renormalized magnetic field , spin relaxation and dephasing rate ) .",
    "in comparism to the case of zero magnetic field ( which was treated within flow equation methods already in ref .   for the isotropic kondo model ) , the central issue is the calculation of logarithmically enhanced contributions at the resonance positions @xmath828 and @xmath889 .",
    "the one - loop leading order theory of ref .",
    "was able to obtain these logarithmic contributions but it was not shown how to include microscopically the cutoff scales from relaxation and dephasing modes into the rg formalism .",
    "furthermore , the renormalization of the magnetic field was not taken into account and the calculation was restricted to the stationary values of the magnetic susceptibility and the conductance ( the spin relaxation and dephasing rates were calculated only perturbatively in the bare coupling and in the absence of a magnetic field in ref .  ) . in this paper",
    ", we have included the renormalization of the magnetic field in @xmath650 and @xmath795 together with the spin relaxation and dephasing rate in @xmath381 and @xmath794 .",
    "this provides a consistent theory for the resonance position and the line shape at resonance , and answers the question which rate occurs in the various logarithmic terms . for stationary quantities , the obvious physical result that the spin dephasing rate cuts off the logarithmic contributions is obtained . for the rates and the renormalized field itself",
    ", it turns out that the spin relaxation rate determines the resonant line shape for the spin dephasing rate and the @xmath0 factor , whereas the spin dephasing rate controls the resonant line shape for the spin relaxation rate .",
    "in addition , it turns out that the logarithmic enhancements or suppressions at the resonance @xmath824 are quite different for the various physical quantities regarding the symmetry for @xmath819 and @xmath821 .",
    "the @xmath0 factor shows a symmetric suppression , the conductance an asymmetric enhancement , the suspectibility shows only an enhancement for @xmath821 , the derivative @xmath938 of the spin relaxation rate only an enhancement for @xmath877 , and the corresponding quantity for the spin dephasing rate only a suppression for @xmath905 .",
    "we proposed an experimental setup with a weakly coupled probe lead to measure the logarithmic suppression of the renormalized @xmath0 factor as function of voltage @xmath26 or magnetic field @xmath27 .",
    "this has to be contrasted to the usual measurement of the @xmath0 factor at resonance @xmath793 from the position of the cotunneling- and kondo - enhanced conductance peak , which provides the @xmath0 factor only for one special value of the voltage . in the anisotropic case ,",
    "we find the obvious result that all logarithmic contributions involving the transverse coupling are suppressed for increasing longitudinal coupling since the renormalization of the transverse coupling is reduced .",
    "however , for the magnetic susceptibility this does not hold since the transverse coupling cancels out in the prefactor of the logarithmic terms .",
    "therefore , the logarithmic enhancements become larger for the susceptibility if one increases the longitudinal coupling .",
    "this result might be helpful to find kondo physics in transport through single molecular magnets , where the transverse coupling can be smaller than the longitudinal one .",
    "concerning the line shape at resonance when increasing the longitudinal coupling , it turns out that the logarithmic features become less pronounced if the spin dephasing rate determines the line shape , whereas it becomes sharper when the spin relaxation rate is involved .",
    "the reason is that the spin dephasing rate involves a voltage - induced term @xmath939 , which increases with increasing longitudinal coupling , whereas the spin relaxation rate involves only the transverse coupling in order @xmath381 .",
