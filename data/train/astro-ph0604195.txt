    "<S> einstein s general relativity will break down at very high energies in the early universe when quantum effects are expected to be important </S>",
    "<S> . if inflation @xcite happens at the very early time and if the period of inflation lasts sufficiently long , then the effects of quantum gravity should in principle leave an imprint on the primordial spectrum of perturbations , since the wavelengths of perturbations emerged from short distances in the early stages of inflation are stretched to the cosmic scales observable today by the rapid expansion during inflation . though we lack a complete theory of quantum gravity presently , we can still look for the hint of these quantum gravity imprints through cosmological experiments such as wmap and sdss . since string / m theory is a promising framework for quantum gravity </S>",
    "<S> , it is of interest to explore specific stringy corrections to the spectrum of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> many authors have considered and discussed this problem . </S>",
    "<S> for the first discussion on the trace of the trans - planckian effect in the primordial spectrum of perturbations see @xcite ; for a review containing a comprehensive list of references see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it should be pointed out that the possible effects of quantum gravity in the spectra of fluctuations in inflationary cosmology may be induced by the consequences of a basic stringy effect , namely the space - time uncertainty relation @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the physical space - time coordinates and @xmath8 is the string scale . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that this space - time uncertainty principle may yield inflation from pure radiation . </S>",
    "<S> a more modest approach was pioneered in @xcite , where the consequences were studied by imposing eq.([stunc ] ) into the action for cosmological perturbations on an inflationary background . on a general ground , </S>",
    "<S> if inflation is indeed affected by physics at a scale close to string scale or a related scale , it can be expected that space - time uncertainty must leave traces in the cmb power spectrum @xcite . the primordial power spectrum based upon the noncommutative inflation model </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been given in @xcite , and the explicit calculation indeed shows that the effects can be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard concordance @xmath9cdm model , which can arise from an inflationary background cosmology in which the quasi - exponential expansion of space is driven by a scalar field , still provides a fairly good fit to the recent three - year wmap @xcite and earlier observations . assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power law spectrum , the wmap three - year data require a spectral index that is significantly less than the harrison - zeldovich - peebles scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests , for power law inflationary models , a detectable level of gravity waves . </S>",
    "<S> however , many inflationary models can only predict a much smaller gravity wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the wmap three - year data can place significant constraints on inflationary models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the chaotic inflationary model with the inflaton potential , @xmath3 , has been tested in light of the current data , with the result that the data prefer the @xmath12 model over the @xmath13 model , assuming a power - law primordial power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> when allowing for a running spectral index , the data will favor a large negative running index and a large tensor amplitude ( characterized by @xmath14 , the ratio of the tensor to scalar power spectrum ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is rather hard to produce a large absolute value of the running spectral index within the framework of the usual slow - roll inflationary models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the confirmation of this suggestive trend is very important for our understanding of the early universe physics , especially of the quantum gravity relevant physics .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been mentioned that the cmb anisotropies may carry a signature of the very early universe corrections from the space - time uncertainty principle motivated by string theory , and can be used to place constraints on the parameters appearing in the noncommutative inflation model . </S>",
    "<S> a recent paper @xcite shows that the noncommutative inflation model can nicely produce a large running spectral index . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> some concrete noncommutative inflation models such as the chaotic inflation and power - law inflation have also been re - examined . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the usual chaotic inflation model can only predict the negligible amount of running index , @xmath15 . though the noncommutative chaotic inflation model can realize a considerable running index , for the @xmath12 model and the @xmath13 model , the authors of @xcite find that a low number of @xmath0-folds , say @xmath16 , is required . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , this is fairly unnatural since such low values of @xmath1 may not be sufficient to resolve the naturalness problems such as the flatness and the horizon puzzles . </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable range of @xmath1 has been derived in @xcite , that is @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model can provide a large negative running spectral index within the reasonable range of @xmath1 , provided that the value of @xmath2 in the potential @xmath3 is enhanced , say @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we perform a likelihood analysis to find the best - fit values of the parameters of the noncommutative chaotic inflation model to the wmap results of the spectral index and its running . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are able to constrain the noncommutative model so as to place limits on the space - time noncommutativity in the string scale .    the space - time noncommutative effects can be encoded in a new product , star product , replacing the usual algebra product . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of a homogeneous and isotropic background will not change and the standard cosmological equations based upon the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric remain the same : @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced planck mass . if @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the scalar field shall slowly roll down its potential . define some slow - roll parameters , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 , then the slow - roll condition can be expressed as @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the stringy space - time uncertainty relation leads to changes in the action for the metric fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the action for scalar metric fluctuations can be reduced to the action of a real scalar field @xmath30 with a specific time - dependent mass which depends on the background cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> thus the modified action of the perturbation led by the stringy space - time uncertainty relation can be expressed as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the total spatial coordinate volume , a prime denotes the derivative with respect to the modified conformal time @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the comoving wave number , and @xmath35 @xmath36 here @xmath8 is the string length scale , @xmath37 and @xmath38 denotes a new time variable in terms of which the stringy uncertainty principle takes the simple form @xmath39 , using comoving coordinates @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of general relativity corresponds to @xmath41 .    in @xcite , the power spectrum in the noncommutative space - time of the curvature perturbation , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the scalar metric perturbation in longitudinal gauge , has been calculated by evaluating the time when fluctuations are generated </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the noncommutative parameter , @xmath46 and @xmath47 takes the values when the fluctuation mode @xmath34 crosses the hubble radius , and @xmath48 is the string mass scale . </S>",
    "<S> then the spectral index of the power spectrum of the scalar fluctuations and its running can be given , @xmath49 @xmath50 when @xmath51 or @xmath52 , the noncommutative parameter @xmath53 , eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ index ] ) and ( [ running ] ) reproduce the results of general relativity in the commutative case . the tensor - scalar ratio is also given , @xmath54 on the other hand , the best fit results of the three - year wmap data only for the @xmath9cdm model with both a running spectral index and tensor modes are @xcite @xmath55 and @xmath56 the fit of the wmap data shows that a large negative running spectral index is favored by the data , and if allowing for a running index , then models with large tensor components are consistent with the data .    </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic inflation has the potential of the form @xmath57 with @xmath2 a positive integer and @xmath58 dimensionless , which provides a way of descending from the planck scale with chaotic initial field conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slow - roll parameters are related to the number of @xmath0-folds @xmath1 of inflation between the epoch when the horizon scale modes left the horizon and the end of inflation by @xmath59 in the noncommutative case , the spectral index and its running as well as the tensor - scalar ratio can be expressed as @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 it can be seen that the running of the spectral index is always negative for the chaotic inflation model . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the power spectrum is always a red spectrum in the usual commutative case . </S>",
    "<S> but it will become blue if @xmath63 in the noncommutative chaotic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> for the chaotic inflation in the usual commutative case , the amount of the running of the spectral index is negligible , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in @xcite , this model in the quadratic case @xmath12 and in the quartic case @xmath13 have been tested by using three - year wmap data assuming a power - law primordial power spectrum , with the result that the data rule out rather firmly @xmath65 . however , the chaotic inflation in the noncommutative case will be capable of producing a large enough running of the spectral index provided that choosing a noncommutative parameter @xmath66 properly , as shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors of @xcite only analyzed the simplest cases of noncommutative chaotic inflation model , i.e. the cases of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and found that in order to realize a large running of the index for matching the wmap data roughly , a rather low @xmath0-folding number @xmath1 is required , say @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> such a low value of @xmath1 , however , seems fairly unnatural as confessed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> actually , reasonable value of @xmath1 should be around 50 , as demonstrated in @xcite , @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that in order to reconcile this conflict within the noncommutative framework the model parameter @xmath2 should be enhanced to @xmath4 .     and </S>",

    "<S> the best fit happens at @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . ]    utilizing the noncommutative chaotic inflation results ( [ index ] ) and ( [ running ] ) to fit the fixed values of spectral index and its running , for instance the wmap central values @xmath75 and @xmath76 , gives a constraint relationship between the noncommutative parameter @xmath66 and the potential parameter @xmath2 , namely @xmath77 , and then obtains the constraint relationship of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this case is plotted in figure [ fig : constraints ] , as indicated by the black solid lines . </S>",
    "<S> the plot explicitly shows that the value of @xmath1 increases with the value of @xmath2 , and @xmath70 is nearly linear . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that @xmath77 becomes nearly flat when @xmath2 goes beyond 10 . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the tensor - scalar ratio @xmath14 and the noncommutative parameter @xmath66 in this case can also be obtained , as shown in figure [ fig : rmu ] , the black solid line . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model can predict a rather big gravitational wave , @xmath78 , which is within the range of the wmap and can be confirmed by the upcoming experiments eventually . if the @xmath0-folds @xmath1 is taken to be a reasonable value , say 54 , then we get @xmath79 , @xmath73 and @xmath80 , as shown in figures [ fig : constraints ] and [ fig : rmu ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that here @xmath2 is restricted to be an integer and is not needed to be an even number . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also consider the uncertainties of @xmath81 and @xmath82 in ( [ scalarwmap ] ) simply . </S>",
    "<S> we take two cases into account , @xmath83 and @xmath84 as well as @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and show the results in figures [ fig : constraints ] and [ fig : rmu ] , represented by the red dashed lines and green dotted lines , respectively . according to @xmath71 </S>",
    "<S> , we have , for these two cases respectively , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 as well as @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , fitting the wmap three year results and at the same time considering a reasonable @xmath0-folds @xmath1 , we conclude that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model should have a potential parameter @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , the noncommutative chaotic inflation predicts a rather big gravitational wave , @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform a likelihood analysis to find the best - fit values of the model parameters , including @xmath2 , @xmath66 and @xmath1 , to the wmap three - year results . according to the wmap results of the spectral index and its running ( [ scalarwmap ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood values of model parameters can be derived by evaluating the @xmath94-distribution . </S>",
    "<S> first , we assume a rather large range for the @xmath0-folds @xmath1 , @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood analysis shows that the best fit happens at @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we assume a more reasonable range for the @xmath0-folds , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the best fit for this case happens at @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distributions of the likelihood values of @xmath2 and @xmath66 are shown in figure [ fig : likelihood ] . in a word , </S>",
    "<S> the wmap three year results require a large @xmath2 for the noncommutative chaotic inflation .    in summary , we analyze the noncommutative chaotic inflation model by means of the wmap three year results . </S>",
    "<S> noncommutative inflation is a modification of standard general relativity inflation which takes into account some effects of the space - time uncertainty principle motivated by ideas from string theory . </S>",
    "<S> this effect of quantum gravity of the very early universe may in principle lead to some corrections to the primordial power spectrum of perturbations and thus leave an imprint in the cmb anisotropy measurements . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the noncommutative inflation model can account for the wmap three year results gracefully . in this paper , we show that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model can provide a large negative running of the spectral index within a reasonable range of @xmath0-folding number @xmath1 , provided that the value of @xmath2 in the potential @xmath3 is enhanced roughly to @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the noncommutative chaotic inflation model predicts a rather big gravitational wave which may be tested by the upcoming experiments . </S>"
