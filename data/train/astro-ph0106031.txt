    "292  ( 1154 ) is a southern supernova remnant ( snr ) , discovered in the radio band ( milne 1969 ; shaver & goss 1970 ) , with a radio spectral index intermediate between that of a typical shell - type and crab - type remnant ( goss et al .  1979 ) .",
    "optically the spectrum is dominated by oxygen and neon emission lines ( goss et al .",
    "1979 ) covering a wide range , @xmath62000 km s@xmath8 , in velocity ( murdin & clark 1979 ) . 292  is , therefore , an oxygen - rich snr , of which there are only two other examples in the galaxy ( cassiopeia a and puppis a ) and a handful elsewhere ( e.g. , n132d , e0540@xmath969.3 , and e0102.2@xmath97219 in the magellanic clouds ) .",
    "it is believed that 292is a young snr with an age @xmath101600 yr in which the supernova ejecta have not yet fully mixed with the swept - up circumstellar material and thus may represent a slightly older version of cas a.    recent developments suggest that 292  is , in fact , a composite remnant , i.e. , one showing both thermal emission from sn ejecta , as well as a synchrotron nebula powered by a rapidly rotating neutron star .",
    "wallace & gaensler ( 1997 ) presented a high resolution 20-cm radio map of the snr from the australia telescope , which shows a bright , extended nebula near the center with a flatter spectrum ( @xmath11 ) than elsewhere in the remnant ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "pulsar - powered plerions , like the crab nebula , have traditionally been distinguished from their shell - type cousins by their flatter radio spectra . recently",
    "torii , tsunemi , & slane ( 1998 ) have reported on the 292  data .",
    "in addition to the thermal emission at soft x - ray energies , above @xmath63 kev they found a hard x - ray source with a power - law spectrum , unresolved at  angular resolution and positionally consistent ( within the usual  position uncertainty of 40@xmath1 ) with the extended , flat - spectrum radio component mentioned above . although not conclusive , these observations suggest that a synchrotron nebula powered by the spin - down of a central pulsar possibly lurks within 292 .",
    "this finding is quite important , since it would allow us to conclusively associate the young , oxygen - rich snr 292  with a core - collapse , massive star sn explosion . indeed",
    "only one other oxygen - rich remnant , snr e0540@xmath969.3 in the large magellanic cloud , is known to contain a rapidly spinning pulsar .",
    "292  was observed with the back - side illuminated chip ( s3 ) of the  advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) ( garmire et al .",
    "1992 ; bautz et al .",
    "1998 ) on 11 march , 2000 , as part of the penn state gto program .",
    "observations were taken in full frame mode with a readout time of 3.2 s. we filtered the data for times of flaring background or bad aspect solution , applied the bad pixel map , and verified that the level 2 events had been gain - corrected using the gain map appropriate to the focal plane temperature at the time of observation ( @xmath9120 c ) . the effective deadtime - corrected exposure time",
    "after time filtering was 43026.6 s.    the s3 chip was used in order to take advantage of its soft response and good spectral resolution .",
    "the pointing direction was set so that as much of the remnant at possible fell on this chip .",
    "the remnant is slightly larger than @xmath13 in diameter so complete coverage was not possible ; small portions of the remnant toward the south and west were not imaged .",
    "in addition , we point out that the imaging quality varies across the s3 field of view . for this observation of 292the aimpoint and its surrounding region of @xmath14 imaging (",
    "50% encircled energy radius ) is on the eastern half of the remnant . at the extreme northern and southern extent of the snr ,",
    "image quality has degraded to @xmath6@xmath15 , while on the extreme western edge it has become @xmath6@xmath16 .",
    "in figure 1 we show images of 292  in soft ( left panel ) and hard ( right panel ) x - ray bands .",
    "the soft x - ray image shows a highly structured and filamentary remnant with features on all scales from arcminutes to arcseconds . the brightest emission is mostly confined to an irregular `` belt '' that runs in an east - west direction across the remnant .",
    "these features tend to be quite narrow ( @xmath103@xmath1 ) in the transverse ( generally north - south ) direction .",
    "comparison of separate images made in energy bands containing the strong o , ne , and mg k@xmath17 lines reveals complex spectral variations with position .",
    "the integrated spectrum of the remnant ( figure 2 ) shows that lines from these species , in addition to si and s , dominate the x - ray emission .",
    "iron appears not to be a major constituent of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "there is no significant fe k - shell emission : the equivalent width of a narrow line feature with energy between 6.4 and 6.9 kev in the integrated acis - s spectrum is @xmath18200 ev ( at 95% confidence ) .",
    "we defer a more detailed quantitative discussion of the thermal emission from 292  to a future study .    in the higher energy band ,",
    "we spectacularly confirm the previous radio and x - ray evidence for a plerion in 292 . embedded within a diffuse nebula approximately 1@xmath19 in radius",
    ", we find a point - like source at position @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which we designate cxou  j112439.1@xmath9591620 ( hereafter the `` pulsar candidate '' ) .",
    "we verified absolute positions in the acis image by identifying two serendipitous x - ray sources with optical stars ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) from the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "our resulting x - ray positions are accurate to @xmath181@xmath1 .",
    "figure 3 shows a smoothed 48 kev x - ray image centered on the pulsar candidate .",
    "this band was chosen to isolate the hard nebular emission and represents a compromise between obtaining sufficient signal from the nebula and avoiding contamination by the generally softer thermal emission .",
    "the pulsar candidate , located near the peak of the diffuse emission , has a fwhm extent of 1.3@xmath1 , while the unrelated source nearby ( which is at roughly the same off - axis angle ) has an extent of 1.1@xmath1 , which we take to infer that the pulsar candidate has an extended component ( perhaps a terminal wind boundary ) .",
    "( neither source shows an obvious optical counterpart in the digitized poss . ) as the insert to fig .  3 shows",
    ", the x - ray emission from the immediate vicinity of the pulsar candidate is rather complex with a symmetric , extended component ( out to a radius of @xmath61.5@xmath1 ) embedded in a ridge of emission that is aligned nearly east - west . on larger scales ,",
    "the pulsar candidate is centered on an arcminute - long ridge of fainter emission that is also oriented in roughly the east - west direction .",
    "the pulsar candidate is located about 0.9@xmath19 from our eyeball estimate of the geometric center of the remnant , which is indicated by the plus sign on fig .",
    "3 .    within a radius of 2.5 pixels ( 1.23@xmath1 ) centered on the position of the pulsar candidate we obtain a total of 3326 acis - s events for a count rate of @xmath24 s@xmath8 .",
    "background , both instrumental and from the rest of 292  itself , was sufficiently small in this aperture to be neglected .",
    "an absorbed power - law provided an acceptable fit to the  data .",
    "numerical values from the fits are given in table 1 and the spectrum is plotted in fig .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes of the pulsar candidate are @xmath25 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath8 ( 0.24 kev band ) and @xmath27 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath8 ( 28 kev band ) .",
    "detection of pulsed emission would clearly confirm the pulsar hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately the low time resolution implicit in the acis timed exposure mode makes detection of rapid pulsations impossible .",
    "we searched unsuccessfully for pulsed emission from the vicinity of the pulsar candidate in the  hri and pspc data . in neither data",
    "set was the candidate detected as a resolved source , due to the poorer angular resolution of these instruments , the strong soft thermal x - ray emission , and the low statistical signal .",
    "in addition there have been no reports of pulsed x - ray emission from 292  from either asca or rxte .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse nebula is significantly contaminated by the remnant s soft thermal emission within annular apertures even rather close to the pulsar candidate .",
    "for example , the aperture extending over 3@xmath1 ",
    "5@xmath1 unmistakeably shows soft thermal emission ( i.e. , prominent lines of o , ne , and mg ) , which introduces significant uncertainty into the derived spectral properties of the hard , diffuse nebula .",
    "nevertheless out to a radius of 20@xmath1 we were able to confirm that the spectrum above 3 kev is a power law with photon index in the range @xmath28 . because of the thermal contamination it was not possible to determine if the photon index of the nebular emission steepened with radius .",
    "such an effect has been seen in other crab - like snrs with  ( e.g. , g21.5@xmath90.9 ; slane et al .",
    "2000 ) and is expected for an extended synchrotron nebula powered by a central pulsar .    the total x - ray flux of the diffuse nebula is an important observable that we estimated in the following manner . in the 48 kev band",
    "the radial profile of the diffuse nebula centered on the pulsar candidate fell roughly as an exponential with radius .",
    "the profile was summed out to the radius where the emission was twice the background level , which yielded a total count rate of 0.145 s@xmath8 . for comparison the pulsar candidate count rate in the same energy band",
    "is only 0.0074 s@xmath8 , while at the other extreme , the total background subtracted rate from 292  is 0.2188 s@xmath8 .",
    "thus the diffuse nebula accounts for 66% of the total 48 kev flux from the remnant .",
    "we assumed the nebular spectral parameters to be the same as those of the pulsar candidate in order to convert the band - limited count rate to fluxes . the estimated nebular spectrum is shown in fig .  2 ( as the middle curve ) .",
    "our estimates of the unabsorbed fluxes from the nebula are @xmath29 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath8 ( 0.24 kev band ) and @xmath30 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath8 ( 28 kev band ) .",
    "the hard band flux would increase by only about 10% if we assume that the nebula s spectrum is steeper , with @xmath31 like the crab .",
    "the increase in the soft band flux in this case would be much larger , about a factor of 2 .",
    "we have presented evidence for a point - like source embedded in a diffuse nebula , both of which exhibit featureless hard x - ray emission and are spatially coincident with a flat - spectrum radio source in the snr 292 .",
    "these features are the classic signatures of a young rapidly - rotating pulsar and its associated synchrotron , or pulsar wind , nebula .",
    "the spin - down energy loss rate of the pulsar can be estimated using the established correlation between this quantity and the nebular x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , seward and wang 1988 ) . from our flux estimate",
    "we obtain an unabsorbed luminosity ( 0.24 kev band ) of @xmath32 ergs s@xmath8 , assuming the hi absorption distance of 4.8 kpc ( saken , fesen , & shull 1992 ) , which implies only a modest spin - down energy loss rate of @xmath33 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "based on this estimate , then for a braking index @xmath34 , and assuming that the current spin period @xmath35 is much longer than the initial value , the remnant age implies @xmath36 ms and a spin - down rate @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to a surface magnetic field strength @xmath38  g , which is quite large .",
    "this value is reduced if we relax the constraint that @xmath39 .",
    "we note that there are considerable uncertainties in this estimate , including the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( see , e.g. , chevalier 2000 ) .",
    "clearly discovery of the pulsed emission from the new pulsar candidate is of highest priority .",
    "observations optimized for fast timing using the hrc on  have been approved for observation in cycle 2 and will be carried out soon .",
    "the pulsar candidate is not directly at the geometric center of the remnant , suggesting that it has moved since birth .",
    "its implied transverse speed of @xmath6@xmath42 is in good agreement , given our uncertainties , with the mean birth velocity of pulsars of @xmath43 ( lyne & lorimer 1994 ) . concerning the uncertainties in our velocity estimate we note that it is likely that the blast wave has expanded more slowly toward the southeast in 292 .",
    "this is where the optical emission is most intense and thus where the density of the ambient interstellar medium should be highest .",
    "if true this would shift the true center of the remnant toward the southeast and thereby reduce the implied transverse velocity of the pulsar candidate .",
    "we note that there is no evidence in the x - ray band for a bow shock preceding the pulsar candidate in this , or any , direction .    to summarize , the  data reveal the effects of a central pulsar on three spatial scales in 292 : an unresolved source ( the pulsar candidate itself ) ; a compact resolved region of x - ray emission surrounding the point source and an extended pulsar wind nebula .",
    "the compact emission near the pulsar ( see insert to fig .  3 ) shows a symmetric component , @xmath61.5@xmath1 ( 0.035 pc ) in size , as well as an elongated ridge of emission covering roughly @xmath44 ( @xmath45 pc ) .",
    "such compact , but resolved , components have been seen by near the central compact objects in other known pulsar - wind nebula , specifically the crab ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 ) and g21.5@xmath90.9 ( slane et al .",
    "2000 ) . these structures , on scales of tenths of parsecs , have been interpreted as arising from the pulsar wind termination shock ( e.g. , rees & gunn 1974 , kennel & coroniti 1984 ) . on larger scales",
    "the triangular morphology of the extended pulsar wind nebula in 292bears considerable similarity as well to the overall shape of the crab nebula .",
    "the physical sizes are similar as well .",
    "the bright portion of the nebula in 292  between the light and dark contours in fig .  3 is roughly 1 pc across , which is just about the same size as the long extent of the so - called x - ray torus in the crab nebula .    during its first year of operation",
    "has discovered point - like sources within the two youngest galactic oxygen - rich supernova remnants ( cas a and g292.0 + 1.8 ) that are likely the compact remnants of these sn explosions .",
    "the compact object in cas a remains mysterious ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "2000 ) , while the one in 292  appears to have characteristics that are consistent with a young rapidly - rotating pulsar like the crab pulsar .",
    "interestingly enough cas a and 292 also differ in the properties of their x - ray emitting ejecta .",
    "cas a is dominated by si- and fe - rich ejecta that were likely produced by explosive o- and si - burning ( hughes et al .",
    "2000 ) . in 292 ,",
    "on the other hand , we have been unable to find evidence for either of these particular types of nucleosynthetic yields , while the most common ejecta features are rich in o , ne , and mg .",
    "further study should reveal whether these differences in the x - ray emitting ejecta are due to an evolutionary or age effect or whether they signal more fundamental differences in the stellar progenitors .",
    "such studies using  will offer us a new window on the connection between compact objects and the sn progenitors that form them .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad astronomical database maintained by the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg .",
    "financial support was provided by nasa contract nas8 - 38252 ( psu ) , nasa contract nas8 - 39073 ( sao ) , and  grant go0 - 1035x to rutgers .",
