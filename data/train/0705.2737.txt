    "the theoretical study of the dynamics of a particle moving in a rapidly oscillating potential has been an active field of research for the past 50 years @xcite . in 1951",
    ", kapitza showed that rapidly oscillating potentials can have a stabilizing effect on dynamical systems @xcite , which he demonstrated utilizing an inverted pendulum whose suspension point was forced to oscillate vertically . for high enough frequencies and large enough amplitudes of this oscillation",
    "the upwards position of the pendulum becomes stable .",
    "kapitza showed that the pendulum feels a time independent _ effective _ potential that has a local minimum at the pendulum s upwards position and thus imparts stability upon it .",
    "this phenomenon has since been termed `` dynamic stabilization '' . in 1958 , paul used the principle of dynamic stabilization to trap charged ions by alternating electric fields @xcite .",
    "ions trapped within a paul trap have and continue to be used in the development of frequency standards , other fundamental measures @xcite and quantum information @xcite . + in order to grasp all the possible applications that are offered by atoms which are trapped by rapidly oscillating potentials , a descriptive theory of their dynamics is indispensable .",
    "for the motion of ions in a paul trap such a theory is given by mathieu s theory , which provides the exact solution of the ion s classical equations of motion in terms of the tabulated mathieu functions @xcite .",
    "however , this theory is restricted to potentials of harmonic shape which are oscillated sinusoidally only . besides this",
    ", mathieu s theory does not raise intuition regarding the atom s dynamics hindering the discovery of new phenomena . for these purposes , kapitza s theory of the effective potential has thus far been suitable , sufficiently explaining the stabilization of the inverted pendulum @xcite .",
    "this theory has since been generalized to arbitrary rapidly oscillating potentials @xcite and extended to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we describe a different phenomenon , which illustrates that the motion of a particle trapped by a rapidly oscillating potential with a vanishing time average significantly depends on the potential s initial phase for arbitrarily high frequencies of its oscillation .",
    "we discover that this phenomenon can not be explained by the effective potential theory which we find to be incomplete .",
    "therefore , we derive the necessary completion in order to describe this phenomenon . + kapitza s effective potential theory is based on a separation of the particle s motion into a slow and a fast changing part . for high frequencies of the potential s oscillation",
    "this separation can be performed in such a way that the slow part is governed by a time independent potential while the fast part has a vanishing time average and a negligible amplitude . in kapitza",
    "s theory it is concluded that the particle s real motion is approximately described by its slow part , such that the real motion can be obtained by replacing its time dependent equation of motion by the time independent equation of motion of the slow part .",
    "however , doing so requires replacing the particle s initial conditions by the corresponding initial conditions of the slow part . if these two sets of initial conditions significantly differ from each other , the replacement of the initial conditions is a crucial point in the determination of the real motion . in the context of adiabatic elimination",
    "a significant difference between the initial conditions of the full problem and the model problem is called an `` initial slip '' @xcite . + we show in our problem that there is an initial slip even for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential s oscillation . as a result",
    ", the approximate determination of the particle s real motion must be performed in two independent steps : firstly the real initial conditions have to be transformed and then the time independent equation of motion of the slow part must be solved for these transformed initial conditions . in kapitza",
    "s theory the transformation of the initial conditions is omitted .",
    "we explicitly derive this transformation and show that it significantly depends on the oscillating potential s initial phase for arbitrarily high frequencies .",
    "this explains the found phenomenon that the particle s motion depends on the initial phase .",
    "+ the phenomenon is clearly manifested in the particle s stability region ( i.e. the region in phase space that contains all initial conditions of the particle leading to subsequent trapping by the oscillating potential ) for which we derive an analytical formula .",
    "furthermore , we show that the phenomenon offers the possibility to manipulate particles , that are trapped by rapidly oscillating potentials , in a simple and controlled manner . for example , modification of the oscillating potential s phase at some point in time by a discrete value ( inducing a phase hop ) results in a change of the trapped particle s average energy .",
    "we explicitly calculate this change in energy and show that it is significant for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential s oscillation . for",
    "the special case of a sinusoidally oscillated arbitrary potential we also show that  in the framework of classical physics  it is significant even for arbitrarily low energies of the trapped particle .",
    "+ we confirm all theoretical findings in this paper by numerical simulations .",
    "for this purpose , we consider two simple examples : a particle moving inside an oscillating gaussian - shaped potential and inside an oscillating parabola - shaped potential . we also propose a simple experiment to validate our findings .",
    "+ throughout the paper we use one - dimensional formalism , but the results presented here can be directly applied to two and three dimensions in cases where the motion is separable @xcite .",
    "for high dimensional oscillating potentials where the particle s motion in not separable and in particular chaotic , new phenomena may occur that are not discussed here @xcite .",
    "in this section , we derive an approximate theory for the motion of a particle that is moving inside a rapidly oscillating potential .",
    "this is done in two steps : firstly , we formulate a model problem with a time independent `` effective '' equation of motion and then we show that this model problem possesses initial slip and derive the necessary transformation of the real problem s initial conditions to the corresponding initial conditions of the model . with the obtained theory",
    "we then verify the stated phenomenon of the dependence of the particle s motion on the initial phase of the oscillating potential .",
    "finally , we describe a clear manifestation of this phenomenon and its main consequences .",
    "+ newton s equation for a particle with mass @xmath0 that is moving inside a one - dimensional rapidly oscillating potential @xmath1 can be written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes the time average part of @xmath1 and @xmath4 its oscillating part and @xmath5 its time modulation function which has period @xmath6 , unity amplitude and vanishing time average over one period .",
    "the frequency of the potential s oscillation is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the initial phase of the oscillating potential @xmath1 .",
    "derivatives with respect to coordinates are denoted by primes and with respect to time by dots .",

    "if the frequency @xmath7 is very large compared to the other time scales of the system , the time dependent equation of motion ( [ realeom ] ) can be replaced by a time independent _ effective _ equation of motion that yields the period - averaged motion of the particle @xcite .",
    "this effective equation of motion can be obtained by separating the motion @xmath11 of the particle into a sum of a slow part @xmath12 , which depends on the slow time @xmath13 , and a fast part @xmath14 , which depends on the fast time @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 @xmath12 and @xmath14 will be referred to as the slow and the fast motion , respectively . for large frequencies",
    "@xmath7 , the amplitude of the fast motion @xmath17 can be assumed to be small , since due to its inertia , the particle does not have the time to react to the force which is induced by the oscillating potential , before this force changes sign . according to @xcite ,",

    "+ the effective equation of motion ( [ effeomfishman ] ) defines a simplified model of the original problem .",
    "we now show that it possesses initial slip . for that matter , we compare both the position @xmath11 with its period - average @xmath12 and the velocity @xmath33 with its period - average @xmath34 determined by the original and the model problem , respectively .",
    "( for a numerical example see sec@xmath21 iii , fig@xmath21 [ trajectories ] . )",
    "we restrict ourselves to the physically interesting case of a particle that is trapped by a rapidly oscillating potential with a vanishing time average ( i.e. @xmath35 ) .",
    "the position @xmath12 and the velocity @xmath34 of the period - averaged motion are determined by equation ( [ effeomfishman ] ) .",
    "thus , for the particle to be trapped , the effective potential ( [ effectivepotential ] ) must have a local minimum .",
    "the spatial width of this local minimum determines the spatial confinement of the particle , and is , according to eq@xmath21 ( [ effectivepotential ] ) , independent of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the position @xmath12 of the trapped particle s slow motion is of the order @xmath36 . according to ( [ xi ] ) ,",
    "the position @xmath37 of its fast motion is of the order @xmath38 and therefore in the limit of large @xmath7 negligible compared to the position @xmath12 of its slow motion .",
    "this means that , for large @xmath7 , one can approximate @xmath39 ( see fig@xmath21 [ trajectories](a ) ) . + the depth of the effective potential s local minimum determines which kinetic energies the trapped particle can have .",
    "it is , according to eq@xmath21 ( [ effectivepotential ] ) , of the order @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the velocity @xmath34 of the particle s slow motion is of the order @xmath22 .",

    "therefore , the velocity @xmath40 of the trapped particle s fast motion is for large @xmath7 not negligible compared to the velocity @xmath34 of its slow motion . as a result , even for large @xmath7 , it is @xmath42 ( see fig@xmath21 [ trajectories](b ) ) , such that in general it is @xmath43 .",
    "this shows that there is an initial slip .",
    "+ this observation explains that in order to determine the particle s period - averaged motion with the effective equation of motion ( [ effeomfishman ] ) for given initial conditions @xmath44 and @xmath45 the initial condition transformation @xmath46 with @xmath47\\right]_{\\tau=0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has to be performed , whereas the contribution of @xmath48 in eq@xmath21 ( [ trafo ] ) can not be neglected .",
    "expression ( [ xi0dododo ] ) depends on the term , which is a function of the initial phase @xmath8 of the oscillating potential @xmath1 .",
    "the initial condition transformation ( [ trafo ] ) therefore depends on @xmath8 , which implies that the resulting period - averaged motion @xmath12 of the particle also depends on @xmath8 ( for a numerical example , see sec@xmath21 iii , fig@xmath21 [ trajectoriesdifferentphi ] ) .",
    "further inspection of expression ( [ xi0dododo ] ) shows , that it also depends on the initial position @xmath44 of the particle .",
    "this implies that the degree of dependence of the particle s motion on the initial phase is determined by the particle s initial position . in the special case that the term vanishes , the initial conditions of the slow motion , @xmath49 , equal the real initial conditions , @xmath50 , and",
    "there is no initial slip . in this case , the motion of the particle is determined by the time independent effective potential ( [ effectivepotential ] ) alone . since @xmath51 $ ] is @xmath6-periodic and has vanishing average , there always exist two phases @xmath52 $ ] for which and vanish .",
    "thus , for every given rapidly oscillating potential , there exist two phases for which the motion of any particle inside this potential is determined only by its time - independent effective potential . +",
    "the significance of the highlighted dependence of a particle s motion on the initial phase is manifested in the particle s stability region , which illustrates the particle s trapping condition .",
    "the stability region is the smallest region in phase space that contains all initial conditions of the particle leading to subsequent trapping by the oscillating potential . since the effective potential ( [ effectivepotential ] ) in equation ( [ effeomfishman ] ) is time independent",
    ", the principle of energy conservation can be invoked for its calculation . for a trapping effective potential",
    "we define @xmath53 as the position of the bottom of the trap and @xmath54 as the position of the trap boundary .",
    "thus , the initial conditions @xmath49 belong to the stability region if they obey the inequality @xmath55 substituting eq@xmath21 ( [ trafo ] ) , solving for @xmath45 , and neglecting terms of higher order than @xmath22 yields @xmath56\\right]_{\\tau=0}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\!\\pm\\frac{1}{m\\omega}\\sqrt{\\overline{\\left(\\int^\\tau [ f(\\tau)]\\right)^2}}\\sqrt{v_1'(l)^2-v_1'(x(0))^2},\\ \\ \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which defines the stability region for large @xmath7 .",
    "the right - hand side of eq@xmath21 ( [ thesis ] ) consists of a phase dependent and a phase independent term which are both of the same order , such that the stability region significantly depends on the phase @xmath8 for arbitrarily large @xmath7 . in sec@xmath21 iii",
    ", we explicitly calculate the stability region for different @xmath8 for two numerical examples . + in the preceding paragraphs we showed that , due to the dependence of the fast motion s initial velocity @xmath48 on the initial phase @xmath8 and due to the significant coupling between the particle s slow motion @xmath12 and @xmath48 , the particle s slow motion @xmath12 is significantly coupled to @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath8 can therefore be used to manipulate the particle s motion .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is modified instantaneously by a discrete value @xmath57 ( a phase hop ) , the position @xmath12 of the particle s slow motion will , on the time scale of the slow motion , change in a non - smooth manner and the velocity @xmath34 will , on this time scale , change non - continuously by a discrete value , @xmath58 . according to eq@xmath21 ( [ trafo ] ) , this change is given by @xmath59 with @xmath60-\\int^{\\tau}[f(\\tau\\!+\\!\\varphi)]\\right]_{\\tau=\\omega t_{\\textrm{\\tiny ph}}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 denotes the time at which the phase hop is induced .",
    "this change in the velocity of the particle s slow motion results in an instantaneous change @xmath62 ( on the slow time scale ) of the period - averaged total energy @xmath63 of the particle , which is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the velocity of the slow motion right before the phase hop . as can be seen from equations ( [ phasehopvelocity ] ) and ( [ phasehopenergy ] ) ,",
    "@xmath66 is of the same order ( @xmath38 ) as @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the period - averaged total energy @xmath63 of a trapped particle can be significantly manipulated by a phase hop for arbitrarily large @xmath7 . + as an example , we calculate @xmath62 for the special case @xmath67 , and assume that the phase hop is induced at a time @xmath68 for which @xmath69_{\\tau=\\omega     t_{\\textrm{\\tiny ph}}}=0 $ ] ( which is the case twice each period of the fast motion ) , and for which the kinetic energy of the slow motion equals three - quarters of the total period - averaged energy , that is ( this is the case four times each period of the slow motion ) . due to energy conservation of the slow motion , it is .",
    "we further assume that the size of the phase hop @xmath57 equals , such that @xmath70_{\\tau=\\omega     t_{\\textrm{\\tiny ph}}}=1 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath71 where the minus sign holds for @xmath72 and the plus sign for @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath62 is therefore independent of @xmath7 and proportional to @xmath63 , so that the relative change , , is independent of @xmath63 ( note , that this holds only in the limit of large @xmath7 and small @xmath63 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to take away more than two thirds of a trapped particle s energy or to give more than five thirds of its energy by inducing a phase hop for arbitrarily high frequencies and  in the framework of classical physics  for arbitrarily low energies ( for numerical examples see sec@xmath21 iii , fig@xmath21 [ singlephasehop ] and fig@xmath21 [ phasehopseries ] ) . in sec@xmath21 iv",
    ", we propose an experiment which may verify this result .",
    "in this section , we consider two simple examples in order to demonstrate the phenomenon found in the preceding section and to compare the derived analytical predictions to results of numerical simulations .",

    "we choose @xmath113 and @xmath114 so that in eq@xmath21 ( [ parabolapotential ] ) the reference frequency @xmath115 as well as the maximum instantaneous potential depth @xmath116 are the same as in ( [ gaussianpotential ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the particle s stability region  once by using the derived equation ( [ thesis ] ) and once by applying mathieu s theory .",
    "equation ( [ thesis ] ) yields @xmath117 a graph of this analytical prediction of the stability region is shown in fig@xmath21 [ stabreg2 ] ( solid curves ) for different @xmath8 .",

    "dotted curve : for @xmath84 ( red).,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    it can be seen that the stability regions of the particle have the shape of an ellipse .",
    "figure [ stabreg2 ] shows a very good agreement of our derived theory and the mathieu theory . in order to confirm the accuracy of the numerical simulations which we performed for the oscillating gaussian - shaped potential in the preceding paragraph , we repeated these simulations for the parabola - shaped potential finding that the obtained results were identical to those obtained from mathieu s theory .",
    "all main results which we demonstrated for the oscillating gaussian - shaped potential were found also for the oscillating parabola - shaped potential .",
    "in this section , we propose an experiment to verify our theoretical results .",
    "consider an ensemble of atoms that is trapped inside a rapidly oscillating potential with a vanishing time average , whose amplitude is chosen such that the ensemble uniformly fills its stability region .",
    "hence the fraction of atoms which remain trapped after a phase hop of the oscillating potential is induced is equal to the mutual overlap of the stability region with the initial time given by the time right before the phase hop and the stability region with the initial time given by the time right after the phase hop . this overlap is exactly determined by equation ( [ thesis ] ) .",
    "it is a function of the time @xmath61 when the phase hop is induced and of the size @xmath118 of the phase hop .",
    "figure [ overlap ] shows this overlap for a two - dimensional oscillating gaussian - shaped potential .     with the stability region of initial phase @xmath119 for different @xmath61 as a function of @xmath57 obtained from the two - dimensional extension of equation ( [ thesis ] ) for an oscillating gaussian - shaped potential .",

    "the overlap of the stability regions is given in units of their total volume.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] +    one can see that , regardless of @xmath61 , at least @xmath123 of the atoms will leave the trap for appropriate @xmath118 . therefore , when measuring the ratio between the numbers of trapped atoms before and after the phase hop for different phase hop sizes , one can expect a clear signal from the experiment .",
    "in conclusion , we investigated the classical dynamics of a particle moving inside a rapidly oscillating potential with a vanishing average .",
    "we found , that the motion of such a particle significantly depends on the oscillating potential s initial phase in the case that the particle is trapped .",
    "the effective potential theory described in the literature failed to describe this phenomenon .",
    "we found that this theory is incomplete .",
    "it states that the motion of the particle is determined by a time independent effective potential , whereas we could show that this is true only if the particle s initial conditions are transformed according to a non - negligible transformation which is significant even for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential s oscillation .",
    "we derived this transformation and showed that it depends on the potential s initial phase which explains the found phenomenon .",
    "we also showed that there always exist two initial phases of the oscillating potential such that the transformation can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the effective potential theory in its previous form , which omits this transformation , can only describe these two special cases correctly .",
    "the phase dependence offers a new possibility to significantly manipulate the dynamics of a trapped particle .",
    "we explicitly calculated the change in a particle s energy caused by a phase hop in the potential s modulation function .",
    "we found that it is significant for arbitrarily high frequencies of the potential s oscillation and  in the framework of classical physics  for arbitrarily low energies of the particle .",
    "it is the subject of future research to find applications of this novel tool of particle manipulation .",
    "the results presented in this article , should also be extended to the quantum regime .",
