    "the vorticity - velocity formulation of the 3d navier - stokes equations ( nse ) reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the velocity and @xmath3 is the vorticity of the fluid ( the viscosity is set to 1 ) .",
    "a comprehensive introduction to the mathematical study of the vorticity can be found in @xcite .    in 2d ,",
    "the vortex - stretching term , @xmath4 , is identically zero , and the nonlinearity is simply a part of the transport of the vorticity by the flow .",
    "this allowed the authors to adopt to 2d a general mathematical setting for the study of turbulent cascades and locality in _ physical scales _ of 3d incompressible viscous and inviscid flows introduced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , to establish existence of the enstrophy cascade and locality in 2d @xcite .",
    "since the vortex - stretching term is not a flux - type term , the only way to establish existence of the enstrophy cascade in 3d in this setting is to show that its contribution to the ensemble averaging process can be suitably interpolated between integral - scale averages of the enstrophy and the enstrophy dissipation rate .",
    "this is where _ coherent vortex structures _",
    "come into play .",

''",
    "this remark was followed by a discussion on dynamical role , as well as statistical signature of vortex filaments in turbulent flows .",
    "several ( by now classical ) directions in the study of the vortex dynamics of turbulence  both in 2d and 3d  are presented in chorin s book _ vorticity and turbulence _",
    "( cf . @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the approach exposed in @xcite is essentially discrete ( probabilistic lattice models ) ; on the other hand , the first rigorous continuous statistical theory of vortex filaments was given by p .-",
    "l . lions and majda in @xcite .",
    "local anisotropic behavior of the enstrophy , i.e. , self - organization of the regions of high vorticity in coherent vortex structures  most notably vortex filaments / tubes  is ubiquitous .",
    "in particular , local alignment or anti - alignment of the vorticity direction , i.e. _ local coherence _ , is prominently featured in turbulent flows .",
    "a strong numerical evidence , as well as several theoretical arguments explaining the physical mechanism behind the formation of coherent structures  including rigorous estimates on the flow directly from the 3d nse  can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "one way to look at the phenomenon of local coherence of the vorticity direction is to interpret it as a manifestation of the general observation that the regions of high fluid intensity are  in the vorticity formulation  _ locally _ ` quasi 2d - like ' ( in 2d , the vorticity direction is _ globally _ parallel or antiparallel ) .",
    "the rigorous study of _ geometric depletion of the nonlinearity _ in the 3d nse was pioneered by constantin when he derived a singular integral representation for the stretching factor in the evolution of the vorticity magnitude featuring a geometric kernel depleted by coherence of the vorticity direction ( cf .",
    "this was followed by the paper @xcite where constantin and fefferman showed that as long as the vorticity direction in the regions of intense vorticity is lipschitz - coherent , no finite - time blow up can occur , and later by the paper @xcite where beirao da veiga and berselli scaled the coherence strength needed to deplete the nonlinearity down to @xmath0-hlder .",
    "a full _ spatiotemporal localization _ of the vorticity formulation of the 3d nse was developed by one of the authors and the collaborators in @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle to the full localization of the evolution of the enstrophy was the spatial localization of the vortex - stretching term , @xmath5 .",
    "an explicit local representation for the vortex - stretching term was given in @xcite , and the leading order term reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the levi - civita symbol and @xmath8 is a spatiotemporal cut - off associated with the ball @xmath9 .",
    "the key feature of ( [ vstloc ] ) is that it displays both _ analytic _ ( via a local non - homogeneous div - curl lemma @xcite ) and _ geometric _ ( via coherence of the vorticity direction @xcite ) _ cancelations _ , inducing analytic and geometric _ local depletion of the nonlinearity _ in the 3d vorticity model .",
    "( for a different approach to localization of the vorticity - velocity formulation see @xcite . )",
    "the present work is envisioned as a contribution to the effort of understanding the role that the geometry of the flow and in particular , coherent vortex structures , plays in the theory of turbulent cascades .",
    "more precisely , we show  utilizing the aforementioned localization within the general mathematical framework for the study of turbulent cascades in physical scales of incompressible flows introduced in @xcite ( in this case , via suitable ensemble - averaging of the local enstrophy equality )  that _ coherence of the vorticity direction _",
    ", coupled with a suitable condition on a modified kraichnan scale , and under a certain modulation assumption on evolution of the vorticity , leads to existence of 3d enstrophy cascade in physical scales of the flow .",
    "this furnishes a mathematical evidence that , in contrast to 3d energy cascade , 3d enstrophy cascade is locally _ anisotropic _ , providing a form of a reconciliation between leonardo s and kolmogorov s views on turbulence on the _ enstrophy level_.    it is worth pointing out that our theory of turbulent cascades in physical scales of 3d incompressible flows is on the _ energy level _",
    "@xcite consistent both with the k41 theory of turbulence and the onsager s predictions on existence of the _ inviscid _ energy cascade ( and consequently , with the phenomena of _ anomalous dissipation _ and _ dissipation anomaly _ ) , as well as with the previous rigorous mathematical work on existence of the energy cascade in the wavenumbers @xcite .",
    "in particular , on the energy level , it does not ` see ' geometric structures .",
    "it is only here , i.e. , on the enstrophy level , that the role of coherent vortex structures is revealed . a distinctive feature of our theory that makes incorporating the geometry of the flow and in particular , local coherence possible is the fact that the cascade takes place in the actual physical scales of the flow . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is nothing in the k41 theory that would contradict existence of the 3d enstrophy cascade ; on the other hand , given that k41 takes place primarily in the fourier space , i.e. , in the wavenumbers , formulating conditions ( within k41 ) faithfully reflecting various geometric properties of the flow is a much more challenging enterprise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 recalls the ensemble - averaging process introduced in @xcite , and section 3 the spatiotemporal localization of the evolution of the enstrophy developed in @xcite .",
    "existence and locality of anisotropic 3d enstrophy cascade is presented in section 4 .",
