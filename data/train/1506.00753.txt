    "the multiset of empirical frequencies of the symbols observed in the @xmath1 samples is a straightforward estimate of the multiset of probabilities in @xmath0 ; this estimate corresponds to the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of @xmath0 .",

    "however , for the purposes of this paper , we view the pml distribution purely as an interesting mathematical object .    the problem of determining the pml distribution ( henceforth termed the `` pml problem '' ) of a given pattern @xmath8 appears to be computationally hard @xcite@xcite .",
    "in part , this is because the underlying optimization problem is not convex .",

    "we show that for all sufficiently large @xmath6 , the degree-@xmath6 optimization problems admit a phase transition phenomenon very similar to that described above for the pml problem . while this falls just short of proving that the bethe approximation itself admits such a phase transition , it lends strong support in favour of this assertion .",
    "the bulk of our proof of the existence of phase transitions in the degree-@xmath6 optimization problems involves analyzing a certain probability distribution , denoted by @xmath19 , on the set of @xmath4 non - negative integer matrices with all row and column sums equal to @xmath6 .",

    "vontobel further proved that the sum - product algorithm ( belief propagation ) can be used to find this minimum , and hence @xmath143 , highly efficiently .",
    "since the bethe permanent is often a very good proxy for the actual permanent @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , having an efficient algorithm to compute it is particularly useful .    for a pattern @xmath8 of size @xmath35 and a probability distribution @xmath67}$ ] , @xmath48 ,",
