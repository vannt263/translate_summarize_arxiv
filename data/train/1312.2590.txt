    "with the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite and a vibrant experimental program to measure its couplings and quantum numbers , significant progress is being made in our understanding of the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the existence of a higgs particle with standard model ( sm)-like properties accentuates the hierarchy problem .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry ( susy ) provides one of the most compelling solutions to the hierarchy problem , and it is intriguing that the higgs boson mass , @xmath1 gev , lies within the range predicted by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "however , with the completion of the 8 tev run at the lhc , new strong limits have been placed on a variety of susy scenarios and spectra .",
    "for example , searches based on several jets in association with large missing transverse energy have lead to bounds on squarks and gluinos in the tev range  @xcite . while we continue pursuing even heavier superpartners in canonical susy models , it is critical that we do not overlook possible loopholes in the experimental searches that may be present in non - standard scenarios .",
    "one interesting example in this regard is a very light bottom squark with a mass well below the kinematic lep bound of 100 gev .",
    "such a light sbottom has been considered on numerous occasions in the past , including studies of its effects on the precision electroweak data  @xcite , the tevatron measurement of the bottom quark cross section  @xcite , new higgs boson decay channels  @xcite , and myriad related phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was observed that a light sbottom can mediate large spin - independent dark matter scattering cross sections which may be relevant for some of the anomalies in the direct detections experiments  @xcite .",
    "regardless of any particular phenomenological motivation , it is of general interest to understand the constraints on this scenario and the allowed regions of parameter space .",
    "the focus of the present work is an investigation of the constraints on the sbottom parameter space implied by the precision electroweak and higgs signal strength data . as we will discuss in detail below",
    ", these constraints only weakly depend on the assumed decay mode of the lightest sbottom .",
    "therefore , conservative , robust statements can be made with regard to the allowed parameter space .",
    "this is in contrast with limits from direct searches at colliders , which strongly depend on the assumptions regarding the superpartner spectum and sbottom decay channels .",
    "we find that the combination of electroweak and higgs data restrict the parameter space to a special region in which the sbottom couplings to the @xmath0 and higgs boson are suppressed .",
    "furthermore , these constraints imply that the second sbottom should be lighter than about 300 gev if the lightest sbottom has a mass of 15 gev or less . concerning the precision electroweak data",
    ", we stress the importance of the measurement of the total hadronic cross section at the @xmath0 pole , @xmath2 , which , independent of any particular model , places a strong constraint on any new decay modes of the @xmath0 boson .    in light of these model independent constraints",
    ", we provide a survey of the existing collider constraints on a canonical scenario in which the lsp is a neutral fermion , such as a bino , gravitino , or singlino .",
    "we particularly emphasize the importance of the direct searches for the second sbottom .",
    "searches are suggested to cover the remaining holes in the sbottom parameter space .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightsbottom ] with a description of the sbottom sector and the radiative corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ewpd ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] we investigate the constraints from the precision electroweak and the higgs signal strength data , respectively , on the sbottom parameter space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stops ] we discuss the effects of the stops on the @xmath3 parameter and higgs mass .",
    "we then combine these model independent constraints in sec .",
    "[ sec : combined ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : collider ] we discuss the collider constraints on light sbottoms . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "we begin by describing our conventions for the sbottom sector . in terms of the gauge eigenstates @xmath4 , the sbottom mass matrix is given at tree level by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the left- and right - handed squark soft mass parameters , @xmath8 is the soft trilinear coupling , @xmath9 is the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter , @xmath10 is the ratio of up and down type higgs vacuum expectation values , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume all parameters are real .",
    "the physical sbottom mass eigenstates are related to the gauge eigenstates through the orthogonal transformation : @xmath13 where the mixing angle @xmath14 satisfies @xmath15 and lies in the range @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath17 can receive substantial corrections at one loop @xcite , which are important for the light sbottom regime considered in this work .",
    "the correction can be written in terms of the parameter @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 this corrects the sbottom mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbottom - mass ] ) .",
    "the dominant effect occurs in the off - diagonal term , which becomes @xmath20 . rather than",
    "compute @xmath18 directly , we will instead find it useful to define the effective parameters , @xmath21 in this way , one can absorb the radiative corrections to the sbottom masses into a redefinition of @xmath8 and @xmath22 and use the tree - level equations for the masses and mixing angles in the sbottom sector .",
    "we note that a complete removal of the @xmath23 dependence is not possible , since it appears also in the diagonal mass entries in  ( [ eq : sbottom - mass ] ) . however , the term proportional to @xmath24 is numerically small and the @xmath25-term contribution is proportional to @xmath26 which is approximately constant for @xmath27 , so that we can safely use eq .",
    "( [ eq : effective parameters ] ) in the regime of interest .",
    "one may further worry that a mismatch can occur in the couplings of the sbottom to other fields .",
    "for our purposes , the couplings of the higgs to the sbottoms will be important when we examine the constraints imposed by the higgs signal strength data .",
    "in particular , the coupling @xmath28 , which is given in the appendix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfermion - higgs ] ) contains the same factor @xmath29 , that appears in the off - diagonal entry of the sbottom mass matrix , and thus the @xmath18 correction can be absorbed in this coupling using eq .",
    "( [ eq : effective parameters ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the stop mass matrix and couplings to the higgs are independent of @xmath22 in the large @xmath22 limit .",
    "therefore , we can safely use the effective parameters to absorb the radiative corrections to the bottom yukawa coupling . for the remainder of this paper",
    "we will therefore use the tree level formulae for the sbottom masses , mixing angles , and couplings , substituting the effective parameters defined above in  ( [ eq : effective parameters ] ) and neglecting small corrections to this approximation which are of order @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will also drop everywhere the ",
    "eff \" subscript , although the use of the effective parameters  ( [ eq : effective parameters ] ) is implied .",
    "as we will see , this approach allows for an analytical comprehension of the predictions and constraints on the parameters of the model , which is more difficult to obtain with a parameter space scan .",
    "in this section we study the impact of sbottoms lighter than @xmath32 on precision electroweak measurements .",
    "such sbottoms can be produced in the decays of @xmath0 bosons via @xmath33 and through the continuum reaction @xmath34 and will therefore enter into the predictions for a variety of precision observables .",
    "however , in order to make sharp predictions , it is necessary to understand how the sbottom decay products are  counted \"  that is , whether the sbottom events populate the signal regions defined in the various analyses underlying the measurements of the precision observables .",
    "this is a difficult question on two fronts .",
    "first , the reconstruction of the sbottom is model dependent and requires assumptions about the decay channel of the sbottom and masses of the sbottom and its decay products .",
    "second , the lep experiments employed a complex and evolving set of strategies to perform these measurements .",
    "for instance , for the measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at aleph , several algorithms were developed to effectively identify @xmath37 quarks , including the presence of a high momentum lepton ( presumed to originate from a @xmath38-hadron )  @xcite , a lifetime tag based on longevity of the @xmath38-hadron  @xcite , and multivariate analysis of event shape variables  @xcite .",
    "it is likely that certain sbottom decays would populate these signal regions , but to properly address this issue would require a detailed simulation of these algorithms that goes beyond the scope of this paper .    to simplify the analysis",
    ", we will make a reasonable assumption about how the sbottom is `` counted '' by the experiments at lep and slc .",
    "we can conceive of the following possibilities :    1 .",
    "_ `` invisible '' sbottom _ : _",
    "i.e. _ , the sbottom events do not populate the signal regions in searches entering into the precision measurements .",
    "this may happen , _",
    "e.g. _ , if the sbottom decays via @xmath39 in the compressed kinematic regime , @xmath40 , such that the @xmath37 quark is too soft to pass basic event selection cuts for hadronic @xmath0 decays  @xcite .",
    "hadronic sbottom _ : this can occur , for instance , if the sbottom decays through an r - parity violating @xmath41 coupling to jets .",
    "_ sbottom counted as a @xmath37 quark_. this will happen , for example , in the stealth kinematic regime , @xmath42 and the sbottom decays via @xmath39 .    in the next subsection , sec .",
    "[ subsec : sbottom - ewpd ] , we will describe the predictions for the precision electroweak observables for the three sbottom reconstruction scenarios listed above . following this",
    "we will present a quantitative analysis of the constraints obtained through a global fit to the precision data .",
    "in particular , we will see that for very light sbottoms with masses below about 15 gev , the lightest sbottom must be largely decoupled from the @xmath0 boson in order to provide a good description of the data .",
    "this conclusion is conservative and robust , _",
    "i.e. _ , it does not depend on which hypothesis is made regarding the sbottom reconstruction .        if the lightest sbottom is  invisible \" , _",
    "i.e. _ , it does not populate any of the visible search channels that enter in the precision measurements , it will still affect the prediction for the total @xmath0 boson width , which is exquisitely measured from the @xmath0 lineshape  @xcite .",
    "a light sbottom leads to the new decay channel , @xmath43 which is kinematically allowed provided @xmath44 .",
    "the partial decay width for the process ( [ zdecaysbottom ] ) , @xmath45 , is given by @xmath46 where the coupling @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 note that this coupling vanishes for a mixing angle @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for mixing angles near this decoupling region , the new decay mode ( [ zdecaysbottom ] ) is suppressed and the predictions for the precision observables are close to their sm values .",
    "away from the decoupling region , however , there will be dramatic departures from the sm predictions due to the new decay mode ( [ zdecaysbottom ] ) .",
    "as an example , a light purely right - handed sbottom ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) yields a contribution to the total width of @xmath52 mev . for comparison ,",
    "the measured value is @xmath53 gev  @xcite , while the sm prediction from the gfitter group @xmath54 gev  @xcite .",
    "thus , a pure @xmath55 is marginally allowed by this measurement alone .    in fact , a more constraining measurement in this scenario is the total hadronic cross section at the @xmath0 pole , @xmath2 .",
    "the prediction for this observable is also modified by the presence of light sbottoms , since the cross section on the resonance depends on the total @xmath0 boson width .",
    "the prediction for this observable is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the total hadronic width of the @xmath0 , and in the last step we have used @xmath59 .",
    "the measured value and sm prediction for this observable are  @xcite ,  @xcite : @xmath60 which disagree at the @xmath61 level .",
    "one observes from eq .",
    "( [ sigmahad - inv ] ) that the presence of the light sbottom only serves to increase the tension as it strictly decreases the theory prediction .",
    "for example , a 15 gev purely right - handed sbottom leads to a prediction @xmath62 nb , which is at odds with the measured value of the @xmath63 level and is therefore disfavored .",
    "we note that this observable was not considered in the recent paper  @xcite invoking a light sbottom to mediate a large neutralino direct detection cross section , and strongly constrains their scenario .",
    "+ we pause here to emphasize that , independent of any particular model , that the total hadronic cross section @xmath2 yields a stronger constraint on a new contribution to the @xmath0 boson invisible width .",
    "if we take the data and sm theory predictions at face value , then demanding that these observables agree to within @xmath64 we find that @xmath65 ( 5.6 ) mev from @xmath2 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "alternatively , one might be skeptical about the @xmath67 sigma discrepancy in @xmath2 . even in this case , if we demand that the new physics contribution to these observables is less than 2 times the combined experimental and theoretical uncertainty , then we obtain @xmath68 ( 5.4 ) mev .",
    "if the sbottom decays to hadrons then one expects that it will contaminate the hadronic width of the @xmath0 boson , @xmath58 .",
    "the hadronic width enters into a number of precision observables , including @xmath66 and @xmath2 already discussed above , as well as @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the leptonic width of the @xmath0 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( defined analogously ) . as in the case of  invisible \"",
    "sbottom decays discussed above , the total peak hadronic cross section measurement is particularly constraining .",
    "the prediction for @xmath2 in this case is @xmath73 where in the second line we have assumed @xmath74 and have used the sm predictions for the hadronic and total widths .",
    "note that the hadronic sbottom leads to a lower value of @xmath2 than in the sm , but the suppression is not as severe as in the case of the invisible sbottom ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigmahad - inv ] ) ) .",
    "for example , a 15 gev purely right - handed sbottom leads to a prediction @xmath75 nb , which is lower than the experimental value by about @xmath76 .",
    "finally , it may happen in some scenarios that the sbottom mimics a @xmath37 quark through its decay .",
    "in addition to the effects described in the hadronic sbottom case above , there are a few additional observables which are affected in the case that a sbottom is reconstructed as a @xmath37 quark , as we now discuss .",
    "the first observable to consider is the forward - backward asymmetry of the bottom quark @xmath36 . in general the forward - backward asymmetry",
    "is defined as @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "if the sbottom is counted as a @xmath37 quark , then the reaction @xmath80 will contribute to this asymmetry .",
    "since the sbottom is a scalar , the forward and backward cross sections for sbottom pair production are identical , and thus sbottom pair production will only contribute to the total cross section for @xmath81 production .",
    "in other words , the effect of the sbottom is to strictly increase the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : afb ] ) , thus lowering the prediction for @xmath36 with respect to the sm prediction .",
    "this is quite intriguing given the longstanding @xmath82 discrepancy in the measured and predicted values of @xmath36 , which are respectively given by  @xcite ,  @xcite : @xmath83 since the sm prediction ( [ eq : afbb - sm ] ) is larger than the measured value ( [ eq : afbb - exp ] ) , a small sbottom pair production cross section will improve the agreement between theory and data .",
    "another observable that is affected in this scenario is @xmath35 , the ratio of the @xmath93 partial width to the total hadronic width .",
    "the prediction is given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is given in eq .",
    "[ eq : z - sbottom - decay ] . as of september 2013",
    ", the predictions and measured values for @xmath35 are  @xcite @xmath96 which are consistent at the 1.2@xmath97 level . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rb ] ) above it is clear that the sbottom contribution can only lead to a larger prediction for @xmath35 than the sm , which if small , will improve the agreement even further .",
    "we now investigate quantitatively the constraints from the precision electroweak data on a light sbottom under each of the possible sbottom reconstruction hypothesis presented at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : ewpd ] .",
    "our results are based on a global fit to the precision electroweak data , which closely follows the fit of the gfitter group  @xcite .",
    "there are 19 observables entering into the fit and 6 fit parameters ( five sm parameters plus the sbottom mixing angle @xmath14 ) leading for 13 degrees - of - freedom ( d.o.f . )",
    ". we will investigate four different sbottom masses @xmath98 = ( 5.5 , 15 , 25 , 35 ) gev . a detailed description of the experimental observables and sm theory predictions that enter into the fit can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "for the sm theory predictions for @xmath66 and @xmath2 we employ the recent numerical parameterizations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which include the complete two - loop electroweak corrections .",
    "an important issue is the treatment of @xmath99 in the fit . the standard procedure , which is followed by the lep electroweak working group  @xcite , the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , and gfitter  @xcite is to allow @xmath100 to float in the fit , thereby providing an independent determination of this parameter .",
    "however , in the light sbottom scenario there is typically a strong preference for low values of @xmath100 , which raises the sm prediction for @xmath2 towards the measured value . due to this strong pull towards low values ,",
    "we constrain @xmath100 in our fit as we now discuss .",
    "besides the precision electroweak data , there are a number of other measurements of @xmath100 , including determinations from tau decays , lattice qcd , deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , heavy quarkonia , and hadronic event shapes ; see the pdg  @xcite and the recent review  @xcite for more details .",
    "the most recent world average , which includes a subset of the various @xmath100 measurements , is @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "however , the central value of @xmath100 must take into account the light sbottom contribution to its running , which is relevant in the extraploation of the dominant low energy determinations of @xmath100 to the scale @xmath102 . running from the scale @xmath103 gev to @xmath104",
    ", we find that the sbottom induces an upward shift @xmath105 . in our fits",

    "next we examine the fit results for a light sbottom assuming that it is  invisible \" , _ i.e. _ , not counted in visible channels , which are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewpd - inv ] . especially for very light sbottoms , we observe that consistency with the data requires a mixing angle that is close to the decoupling value , @xmath115 .",
    "away from this value , _",
    "e.g. _ , for mostly right - handed sbottoms ( @xmath116 ) or for highly mixed and left - handed sbottoms , the total peak hadronic cross section @xmath2 is much too small compared to the measured value , yielding a poor global fit .",
    "another general feature that is obseved in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewpd - inv ] is that the allowed parameter space opens up for larger sbottom masses , which can easily be understood as a consequence of the phase space suppression in the @xmath33 width in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z - sbottom - decay ] ) .    for the case of the hadronic sbottom ,",
    "the results of the fit are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewpd - had ] . as in the case of the `` invisible '' sbottom just discussed , there is a strong preference for a mixing angle near the decoupling value @xmath115 .",
    "large mixing angles @xmath117 are disfavored regardless of the sbottom mass , while for light sbottoms below about 25 gev , purely right - handed sbottoms @xmath116 are also disfavored . again , the main culprit is @xmath2 , which becomes much smaller than the experimental value for mixing angles away from the decoupling value . note that in comparision to the  invisible \" sbottom there is a broader region around the decoupling value that provides a good description of the data .",
    "this is because the increase in @xmath58 as @xmath14 becomes smaller raises the prediction for @xmath118 , bringing it in better agreement with the measured value .",
    "this partly compensates the increased tension in @xmath2 and @xmath35 as @xmath14 is decreased .",
    "lastly , we consider the case in which the sbottom is counted as a @xmath37 quark . the results for this case are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewpd - b ] .",

    "this is indicated by the two local minima in the total @xmath108 ( solid grey ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : ewpd - b ] .",

    "we stress , however , that it is likely challenging to construct a scenario in which such a heavy @xmath77 can mimic a @xmath37-quark , since the emitted @xmath37 quarks may be softer or more acoplanar than if directly produced . on the other hand , it is possible for a light @xmath77 to mimic a @xmath37 quark , and we will discuss such a scenario in sec .",

    "let us therefore consider these cases in some detail .      in the compressed regime , @xmath40 ,",
    "the lsp carries most of the momentum of the sbottom while the @xmath37 quark is fairly soft .",
    "however , @xmath235 pairs will , in the absence of initial state radiation ( isr ) , be produced back - to - back , and therefore the missing momentum in such events will be suppressed since the two lsps emitted in the decay also travel back - to - back .",

    "in such events the sbottoms pairs are boosted and the lsps are therefore misaligned , leading to a significant missing momentum .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite investigated the constraints from the cms monojet search  @xcite , concluding that sbottoms heavier than about 24 gev are ruled out .",
    "furthermore , the lhc sbottom searches  @xcite looking for 2 @xmath37-jets and missing transverse energy often consider signal regions with an additional hard jet to attack the compressed regime and could be sensitive to such a light sbottom , particularly because the production rate is enormous .",
    "we are aware of a forthcoming study considering the limits from the lhc sbottom searches on very light sbottom pairs produced in association with a hard jet  @xcite .",
    "besides direct production of the lightest sbottom , one can look for signatures of the second sbottom @xmath229 , which as emphasized already , must be lighter than about 300 gev if the first sbottom is below 15 gev .",
    "for instance , the atlas sbottom search  @xcite places a limit @xmath236 , under the assumption of a @xmath237 branching ratio for the decay @xmath238 . in the presence of a very light first sbottom @xmath77 , there will be additional decay modes @xmath239 , @xmath240 .",
    "this will lead to an @xmath241 suppression in the branching ratio @xmath242 which , however , will generally not be sufficient to evade the constraints on a 300 gev sbottom . one way to evade the constraints on @xmath229 pair production from these searches would be to consider a gravitino or singlino lsp , since the decay rate @xmath243 would be suppressed in such a case . however , in this case , one should consider alternative channels involving the @xmath0 boson in the @xmath229 decay .",
    "in particular , the signature may show up in susy searches with leptons or searches for heavy @xmath244 quarks ( which decay via @xmath245 ) .",
    "we will return to the constraints from @xmath244 searches momentarily .",
    "looking forward , it would be useful for atlas and cms to develop searches with the aim of explicitly probing the lightest sbottom , perhaps by taking advantage of events with hard isr .",
    "it would also be desirable to search for the second sbottom decaying via @xmath239 which are relevant for a gravitino or singlino lsp .",
    "such searches could exploit the dilepton pairs from the @xmath0 , in addition to the @xmath37-jets and missing transverse energy .      besides the compressed regime , another kinematic region which is not covered by sbottom searches at @xmath234 colliders is the stealth regime , @xmath246 , so named following refs .",
    "@xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the lsp emitted in the decay of the sbottom is very soft , and the sbottom is essentially indistinguishable from a @xmath37 quark .",
    "note that this provides one concrete mechanism by which a sbottom would be counted as a @xmath37 quark in the precision electroweak measurements .",
    "first , we note that a very light bino in this case is ruled out by searches for invisible decays of @xmath247(1s ) .",
    "sbottom exchange will mediate the annihilation decay @xmath248 . using the results of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the branching ratio @xmath249 .",
    "a search from babar  @xcite in events containing @xmath250 leads to the constraint @xmath251 in order to evade the bound , a mixing angle of @xmath252 is needed , which is well outside the region allowed by the precision electroweak data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : combined-1 ] for @xmath121 gev ) .",
    "thus , a pure bino lsp is ruled out in this scenario . in principle , it may be possible to weaken this bound by allowing a large admixture of higgsino in the lightest neutralino eigenstate , but then one must contend with other challenges , such as new @xmath0 and higgs decays to neutralino pairs and the expectation of very light charged states .    instead , one can consider a gravitino or singlino lsp . in this case , we expect that the second sbottom will preferentially decay via @xmath239 , @xmath240 rather than directly to the lsp",
    ". therefore , since the @xmath77 will be reconstructed as a @xmath37 quark , the signature of second sbottom @xmath229 will be very similar to that of a heavy @xmath244 quark which decays via @xmath253 , @xmath254 .",
    "searches for @xmath245 have been carried out by atlas  @xcite , cms @xcite , and cdf  @xcite .",

    "the cms searches explicitly cover masses above 350 gev but may also have sensitivity to lighter sbottoms .",
    "naive extrapolation of these limits to lower @xmath229 masses would seem to rule out additional parameter space , although a more detailed study is needed to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "the collaborations should carry out searches to explicitly cover the possibility of a second sbottom which mimics a @xmath244 quark , but has a lower production rate .",
    "furthermore , since the lightest sbottom is mostly left - handed , there is also a light stop in the spectrum , which will dominantly decay via @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , the stop will mimic in all respects a fermionic top partner , @xmath256 , but with a much lower production rate .",
    "we have given a cursory discussion of the collider constraints on the very light sbottom scenario in the case that the lsp is neutral fermion .",
    "the scenario appears to face strong constraints , particularly if @xmath123 gev , since in this case the second sbottom should be lighter than about 300 gev and is constrained by various searches at colliders .",
    "however , a detailed study and recasting of existing searches should be performed to see if any allowed regions exist .",
    "one possible way out of these limits is to consider additional light states in the spectrum , _",
    "e.g. _ , electroweakinos , which may open up new decay modes for the second sbottom .",
    "additionally , one could consider the lightest sbottom to be the lsp and decay through a small r - parity violating coupling .",
    "for example , if the sbottom decays through a @xmath41 operator to a pair of jets , then the direct collider constraints on the scenario will be quite weak due to the huge qcd background .",
    "in this paper we have investigated a scenario containing a very light sbottom with mass @xmath257 .",
    "we have focused on the indirect , but less model dependent constraints obtained from the sbottom contributions to the precision electroweak and higgs signal strength measurements . particularly for a light first sbottom with mass below about 15 gev , these combined datasets leave open a small region of parameter space and predict that the second sbottom is below about 300 gev .",
    "however , if the first sbottom is a bit heavier , then the mass of the second sbottom can be raised to much higher values .",
    "the conclusions above are drawn under the assumption that the sbottom is `` counted '' as a @xmath37-quark . in this case",
    "the precision constraints coming from the production of sbottoms through the new decay @xmath33 and the continuum process @xmath258 are the weakest .",

    "<S> we investigate the phenomenological viability of a very light bottom squark , with a mass less than half of the @xmath0 boson mass . </S>",
    "<S> the decays of the @xmath0 and higgs bosons to light sbottom pairs are , in a fairly model independent manner , strongly constrained by the precision electroweak data and higgs signal strength measurements , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints are complementary to direct collider searches , which depend in detail on assumptions regarding the superpartner spectrum and decays of the sbottom . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if the lightest sbottom has a mass below about 15 gev , compatibility with these measurements is possible only in a special region of parameter space in which the couplings of the lightest sbottom to the @xmath0 and higgs are suppressed . in this region , </S>",
    "<S> the second sbottom is predicted to be lighter than about 300 gev and can also be searched for directly at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also survey relevant collider searches for canonical scenarios with a bino , gravitino , or singlino lsp in the compressed and stealth kinematic regimes and provide suggestions to cover remaining open regions of parameter space . </S>"
