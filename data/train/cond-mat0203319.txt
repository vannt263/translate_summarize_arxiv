    "the prospect of quantum computing ( qc ) has caused great excitement in condensed matter physics .",
    "if a set of qubits can be maintained in a coherent , controllable many - body state , certain very difficult computational problems become tractable . in particular , successful qc would mean a revolution in the areas of cryptography @xcite and data - base searching @xcite .",
    "in addition , it would mean a great advance in general technical capabilities , since the control of individual quantum systems and their interactions would represent a new era in nanotechnology .",
    "however , from a practical point of view , a dilemma presents itself immediately . on the one hand ,",
    "one wishes to control quantum degrees of freedom using external influences , since that is how a quantum algorithm is implemented , and to measure them , since that is the output step .",
    "on the other hand , the system must be isolated from the environment , since random perturbations will destroy the quantum coherence that is the whole advantage of qc .",
    "this is the isolation - control dilemma , and it leads to a very rough figure - of - merit @xmath1 for any quantum computer . if we define the decoherence time @xmath2 as the time it takes to lose quantum coherence , and the clock speed @xmath3 ( roughly the inverse of the time to run a logic gate ) , then the figure of merit is @xmath4 and a practical machine should satisfy @xmath5 at least . if the clock speed is limited only by standard electronics , then we may be able to achieve @xmath6 .",
    "this would imply that @xmath7 is a lower limit for the decoherence time .",
    "the dilemma has not yet been solved , though a number of solutions have been proposed .",
    "a particularly attractive solution is to use spin degrees of freedom as qubits .",
    "nuclear spins interact relatively weakly with their environment because the coupling , proportional to the magnetic moment , is small .",
    "yet there has grown up a sophisticated technology ( nmr ) for the manipulation of the spins , and some rudimentary computations have been performed @xcite .",
    "readout is the main difficulty with this approach , since the field created by a single moment is tiny , and pure states can not be achieved in the macroscopic samples used .",
    "electron spins also interact weakly with the environment in some circumstances : relaxation times in excess of @xmath8 have been measured for donor bound states of phosphorus - doped silicon ( si : p ) @xcite . the corresponding manipulation technology ( esr )",
    "has also reached a high level of sophistication , but the magnetic moment of the electron exceeds that of the nucleus by 3 orders of magnitude , which presents problems of isolation .",
    "readout should be easier than for nuclei , since detection of single electron charges is certainly possible @xcite , and spin - dependent detection is not far out of the reach of current technology .",
    "solid - state implementations of qc are particularly attractive because of the possibility of using existing computer technology to scale small numbers of qubits up to the @xmath9 or so that would be needed for nontrivial computations .",
    "the first paper to propose using the electron spin in a quantum dot subjected to a strong dc magnetic field was that of loss and divincenzo @xcite .",
    "kane @xcite proposed employing the nuclear spin in the si : p system as the qubit .",
    "a specific structure consisting of silicon - germanium ( sige ) layers was proposed by vrijen _",
    "this structure incorporates the idea that the @xmath10-factor of an electron can be changed by moving it in a ge concentration gradient , allowing individual electron to be addressed by the external ac field .",
    "a different sige structure has been proposed by friesen _",
    "this structure is designed so that the electron number on the dots , and the coupling between the dots , can be carefully controlled .",
    "solid - state implementations must also face the isolation - control dilemma .",
    "decoherence times must exceed the @xmath11 number in the actual physical structures that are needed for the operation of quantum algorithms .  in this paper , we examine whether this can be the case for some of the existing proposals based on electron - spin qubits .  in the process , we hope to learn something about modifications to these structures that can increase @xmath2 .",
    "we shall focus on low temperature operation , since , as we shall see , this will probably be necessary in order to obtain sufficiently large @xmath2 .",
    "we can build on a large body of work , both theoretical and experimental , from the 1950 s and 1960 s on esr in doped semiconductors .  in a series of papers , feher and collaborators @xcite investigated the relaxation time for the spin of electrons bound on donor sites in",
    "lightly doped si . at sufficiently low temperatures , the relaxation time",
    "@xmath12 is dominated by single - phonon emission and absorption . in the presence of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , this can relax the spin , causing decoherence .",
    "the theory was worked out by hasegawa @xcite and roth @xcite .",
    "it must of course be recognized that this spin - lattice relaxation time is not necessarily to be identified with the decoherence time .",
    "the decoherence time is the shortest time for any process to permanently erase the phase information in the wavefunction .",
    "this may mean the phase for a single spin , but it also means that the relative phases of the wavefunctions of different spins must also be preserved , so that processes that cause mutual decoherence must also be taken into account .",
    "the actual decoherence time is the minimum of all of these times .",
    "a spin relaxation time in excess of @xmath11 is a necessary , not a sufficient , condition for the viability of a solid - state electron - spin qc proposal .",
    "a qc must have precise input as well as an accurate algorithm .",
    "preparation of the spin state is often proposed to be done by thermalization of the spin system at a low temperature .",
    "the time to do this actually sets an _",
    "limit on the relaxation time of whatever processes thermalize the spins to the lattice .",
    "a limit of perhaps @xmath13 @xmath3 is a reasonable requirement .",
    "this paper focuses on @xmath12 , the time for relaxation of the longitudinal component of the magnetization , by spin - phonon interactions .",
    "these processes cause real spin - flip transitions .",
    "they occur at random times and thus indubitably cause decoherence .",
    "in addition to these processes characterized fully by @xmath12 , there are processes which introduce random phase changes in the spin wavefunctions .",
    "to characterize all such processes by a single  dephasing time ",
    "@xmath14 will usually not be sufficient for understanding the operation of a multi - qubit system @xcite .",
    "difficulties of definition arise , and care must be taken to specify which phase is involved and to what extent it is randomized .  for a single spin system there is no ambiguity .",
    "the @xmath15 density matrix @xmath16for the qubit with cylindrical symmetry involves only 2 independent parameters @xmath17 , and @xmath18  the time dependence of @xmath17 after a system preparation is exponential with decay constant @xmath12 and represents the return of the longitudinal component of the magnetization to its equilibrium value .",
    "the decay is due to inelastic transitions of the type calculated in this paper .",
    "@xmath19 on the other hand , is nonzero only if the preparation of the spin state has a transverse component : @xmath20  the decay of this quantity represents the irreversible conversion of this state to an incoherent mixure of  up  and  down  states .  again , this is genuine decoherence of the spin state , since the phase information can not be recovered .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath19 when the spin is in a strong field has been calculated by mozyrsky _",
    "@xcite using a markovian approximate master equation .",
    "they find that the time scale of the decay due to spin - phonon coupling is very short , of the order of the time for a phonon to cross the electron s wavefunction , which is about @xmath21 .",
    "but the decay is incomplete , with @xmath19 retaining all but @xmath22 of its original value . their calculation was for si : p ,  but a very similar result should hold for the dot case .",
    "decoherence at this level is certainly acceptable for quantum computing .",
    "these authors also pointed out that the decay of the remainder of @xmath23 is due to the spin - flip processes computed in this paper .  if @xmath14 is defined as the dominant decay time of the off - diagonal density matrix element , then @xmath24 for spin - phonon processes .    a quite different source of decoherence is the hyperfine coupling to nuclear spins .",
    "the nuclear spins produce an effective random magnetic field on the electrons .",
    "very recent calculations using semiclassical averaging techniques @xcite have obtained a very short relaxation time @xmath25 for gaas - based dot systems in a strong field .",
    "this represents the decay of the transverse magnetization of an ensemble of dots .",
    "this is a dephasing time , but _ not _ a decoherence time .",
    "the electrons spins precess in what is effectively the frozen field of the nuclei .",
    "this field is spatially random , and the differential precession of the electron spins leads to the magnetization decay .",
    "however , this is not an irreversible loss of the phase information of the collective wavefunction .",
    "spin echo exeriments are a very beautiful demonstration of precisely this point .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening  presents challenges for the calibration and operation of quantum computers , but does not destroy coherence .    finally , in any implementation based on electron",
    "spin qubits , there will certainly exist small interactions between the spins themselves .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction , for one , can not be avoided , and there may be indirect spin - spin interactions mediated by the gates .",
    "a recent paper suggests that these interactions set the fundamental time scale @xmath26 for si quantum dot implementations of qc @xcite .",
    "these interactions do produce experimental broadening of esr lines in experiments on bulk systems , and this might be taken as decoherence . in our view , however , these interactions do not destroy the coherence of a state .",
    "the system is the set of all the qubits . during the course of a quantum algorithm they are collectively in a pure state ( in principle ) .",
    "any decoherence that destroys the purity of the state comes from averaging over the unknown states of the environment .",
    "the broadening that comes from dipole - dipole interactions comes , in nmr and esr calculations , from averaging over the states of the system itself , which is not an appropriate method for calculating decoherence .",
    "the effect of qubit - qubit interactions that can not be turned off is to complicate the quantum algorithm .",
    "a quantum algorithm is a unitary transformation that must always include the effect of the system hamiltonian ( including dipole - dipole interactions ) in addition to external operations . in every case except for very simple ones , this algorithm must first be computed , presumably with the help of a classical computer .",
    "this step in qc may be termed `` quantum compilation '' .",
    "the issue that qubit - qubit interactions raise is not one of decoherence , but rather whether the determination of the algorithm , the complation step , becomes prohibitively difficult .",
    "this could happen for two reasons .",
    "one is that the interactions are so poorly known that they can not be corrected for .",
    "it seems likely that quantum error correction can resolve this difficulty .",
    "a second and more interesting possibility that the interactions convert the computation of the algorithm itself into a problem that grows exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "we regard this as an open question and a deep one , that combines many - body theory with algorithm design and error correction .",
    "we note that in nmr implementations the interaction between the qubits also can not be turned off , but it can be canceled by refocusing @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to evaluate the importance of spin - phonon coupling as a source of decoherence in quantum dot qubits .",
    "fundamentally , the issue is whether the long relaxation times @xmath27 observed at low temperatures in bulk si : p carry over to sige dots proposed for qc . in sec .",

    "si - ge heterostructures are utilized widely in the digital electronics industry , and presently have the shortest switching times of any device .",
    "one reason for their success lies in the ability to engineer structures of near perfect purity , with control over thicknesses and interfaces that approaches atomic precision  a technological tour - de - force .",
    "an equally key achievement has been the harnessing of strain as a tool to control band offsets in heterostructure devices .",
    "this paper presents calculations of spin relaxation for real sige structures such as those proposed by vrijen _",
    "_ @xcite and friesen _ et al .",
    "accordingly , we have calculated the electron wavefunctions in quantum wells , which is needed as input for these calculations .",
    "details of these calculations are presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will not be repeated here . in this section",
    "we only describe those aspects of the calculations that are germane to spin relaxation .",
    "quantum wells are constructed by sandwiching a very thin layer of one material between two others .",
    "electrons can be confined in the quantum well layer when the conduction band offsets produce a potential well .",
    "the key to this technology is therefore to understand the band structure of the various layers . in this section",
    "we will consider a particular class of wells formed of pure si , sandwiched between barrier layers of sige .",
    "we will find that this is optimal from the standpoint of spin coherence .",
    "metallic gates or impurities create zero - dimensional bound states that define a quantum dot .",
    "we first review briefly effective mass theory for dots in pure , unstrained si , then unstrained sige , and finally strained si .    in pure si ,",
    "the @xmath28 conduction band minima occur near the symmetry points @xmath29 , in the directions @xmath30 . in a perfect si crystal",
    "these minima are six - fold degenerate , the valleys being equivalent .  in the dot",

    "to the extent that the scale of variation of @xmath32 is much longer than the atomic spacing there are six nearly degenerate ground states .",
    "this is referred to as the  valley degeneracy  .",
    "the wavefunctions can be written as@xcite @xmath33here , @xmath34 is a bloch function of the form @xmath35where @xmath36 are the six @xmath28 minima @xmath37 ( we shall always use this ordering ) , and @xmath38 are periodic functions with the same periodicity as the crystal potential @xmath39 .",

    "sec : decoherence ] .",
    "this formalism is a good approximation for both dot and impurity bound states , as the valley splitings are much smaller than the energy scales in [ eq : envelope ] .",

    "the relaxation time @xmath12 is defined by @xmath105  @xmath106 .",

    "these are :  ( 1 ) spin rotation symmetry , meaning that the electron spin can not be flipped by a phonon ; this symmetry is broken by soc ; ( 2 ) time - reversal symmetry , meaning that one state can not be changed into its time - reversed partner by emission or absorption of a phonon ; this symmetry is broken by the external magnetic field ; ( 3 ) point group symmetries ; these are partially broken when strain is applied .",
    "the spin rotation symmetry would rule out phonon - mediated transitions between the two states entirely if there were no spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) .",

    "the most obvious is the single - particle potential that binds the electron .",
    "the gate potential is much smoother than the hydrogenic potential of the impurity .",

    "( in fact a naive estimate of the enhancement is a factor of 400 . )",
    "on the other hand , the structures we consider have strong lattice strain .",
    "this partly lifts the valley degeneracy and also reduces the matrix elements , which decreases the rate .",
