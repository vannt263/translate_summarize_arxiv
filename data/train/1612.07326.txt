    "the observational evidence of extreme co excitation in u / lirgs is explained by a combination of several heating models of interstellar medium ( ism ) which consists of cosmic - ray dominated regions ( crdrs ) , photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) , x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ) , and/or mechanically dominated regions ( mdrs ) , because coarse single - dish beams ( @xmath11 10  kpc ) are not possible to distinguish many molecular conditions @xcite .",

    "the outer disk is only detected in extended pa @xmath19 and soft x - ray emission @xcite , indicating a site of moderate star formation relative to the ring ( but we still have missing flux for extended , low surface brightness co  ( 65 ) emission ) .",
    "all co  ( 10 ) peaks outside the starburst ring coincide with the peaks detected in pa @xmath19 ( figure  [ figure_1]c ) .",

    "this is consistent with the velocity modeling with tilted concentric rings provided by @xcite .",
    "the velocity field and dispersion of the starburst ring smoothly connect to those of the outer disk , which indicates that the kinematics ( e.g. , position angle , inclination ) are similar .",
    "we identify non - circular motions in a region with a length of 9(@xmath1 3  kpc ) that is extended from north to south of the disk ( dashed lines in figure  [ figure_2]b ) in all co images , except for the co  ( 65 ) .",

    "the peak radius shifts toward outside as the co transition shifts to lower-@xmath0 , showing a radial excitation gradient in the starburst ring ( see section  [ radex ] ) . in figure  [ figure_3]b , as a comparison , we plot the normalized radial distribution of the radio - to - fir sed of ngc  1614 with the same angular resolution and mrs .",
    "all of the continuum emission ( synchrotron , free - free , and cold dust ) are more compact than the lower-@xmath0 co transitions , but the sizes are similar to the extent of the co  ( 65 ) emission .",

    "the low s / n high - velocity wings ( figure  [ figure_2b]b and [ figure_2b]c ) are consistent with the presence of a putative outflow suggested by @xcite .",
    "we investigate the pvd of the aca - combined image along the north - south ( along the kinematical major axis with a width of 134 ; figure  [ figure_5]e ) and east - west direction ( along the kinematical minor axis with a width of 46 ; figure  [ figure_12b]a ) through the radio nucleus @xcite . along the major axis , we found more extended components than the @xmath12-clipped co  ( 10 ) image .",
    "the aca data shows features that are consistent with bar - induced inflow motions predicted by @xcite . in contrast , as shown in the pvd along the minor axis which emphasizes low surface brightness components within the 46 width , there are high - velocity components around the nuclear region . since the high - velocity components show the same spatial and spectral distributions as the molecular gas outflow suggested by @xcite , we regard the high - velocity components as the molecular gas outflow .",
    "we constructed the integrated intensity image of the blueshifted ( 4340 - 4460  km s@xmath18 ) and redshifted ( 4940 - 5000  km s@xmath18 ) outflows in figure  [ figure_12b]b .",

    "the peak position of each line ratio is located at 1east of the nucleus .",
    "since it coincides with the eastern part of a possible ionized and molecular gas outflow @xcite , the high line ratio component might be due to the interaction between the outflow and the starburst ring .",
    "strong outflow can heat surrounding ism kinematically .",
    "this results in highly excited ( i.e. , low-@xmath0 depopulation ) or highly turbulent ( i.e. , low optical depth ) molecular gas around the shock interface , and thus high line ratios .",

    "the single - phase model shows a radial gradient of the gas kinetic temperature from 70 to 20  k and the h@xmath22 column density from 10@xmath119 to 10@xmath149 @xmath50 with peaks at the starburst ring .",

    "4 .   the two - phase radex model for the starburst ring shows a good agreement with a cold gas component of @xmath1 19  k and a warm gas component of @xmath10 70  k , while there are number of assumptions at this stage .",
    "this is consistent with the two - phase dust ism ( @xmath1 35  k and @xmath1 110  k ) revealed by high - resolution ( @xmath21 05 ) mid - ir and far - ir observations and two - phase modelings for other nearby u / lirgs .",

    "considering that the observed star - forming activities are not enough to power the warm gas component inferred from the two - phase radex , we suggest mechanical heating from supernovae and stellar winds as an alternative power source .",
    "the summation between the cold molecular gas outflow rate ( ofr ) and the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the starburst ring is comparable to the cold gas inflow rate ( ifr ) , showing evidence of the balance between the molecular gas input and output at the starburst ring . assuming ifr , ofr , and sfr continue constantly , it takes dozens of myr to exhaust all h@xmath22 mass in ngc  1614",
