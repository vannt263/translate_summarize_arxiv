    "the origin of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) is still unknown .",
    "however , big progress on the understanding of this phenomenon has been achieved in past years due to the good quality data taken by current observatories .",
    "it is believed that uhecrs are accelerated in extragalactic objects and propagate through the universe to reach earth .",
    "the main source candidates are active galactic nuclei , radio galaxies , and gamma - ray bursts ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "it is also believed that at low energies the cosmic rays originate in galactic astrophysical objects like supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "therefore , the galactic - extragalactic transition of the cosmic ray flux should be located in an intermediate energy region .",
    "the cosmic ray energy spectrum observed at earth is a very rich source of astrophysical information .",
    "it can be roughly approximated by a broken power law with four spectral features : the knee at a few @xmath0 ev , the ankle at @xmath1 ev , the cutoff or suppression at @xmath2 ev , and a second knee at @xmath3 ev , recently reported by the kascade - grande collaboration @xcite .",
    "the origin of the suppression is not clear yet",
    ". it can be due to the interaction of the cosmic rays with the radiation fields in the intergalactic medium , on the route to earth , the inefficiency of the sources to accelerate particles at higher energies , or a combination of both effects .    the composition profile as a function of energy is also a valuable piece of information for the understanding of the origin of the cosmic rays .",
    "in this regard , the data collected by the pierre auger observatory , located in the southern hemisphere , shows a change that marks the beginning of a transition from light to heavy primaries @xcite .",
    "such a transition is not confirmed by the telescope array data , which is more compatible with a proton - dominated composition @xcite .",
    "however , the present statistics of the telescope array data is not enough to distinguish between the composition profile seen by auger and a proton - dominated case @xcite .",
    "note , however , that regarding composition the interpretation of the experimental data is based on shower simulations for which high energy hadronic interaction models , that extrapolate low energy data from accelerators up to the energy of the cosmic rays , are used .",
    "therefore , the composition determination is subject to systematic uncertainties coming from such extrapolation of the high energy hadronic interactions . in any case",
    ", there is a real possibility that nuclei heavier than protons dominate the energy spectrum at the highest energies .    at present , there is no identification of any cosmic ray extragalactic source .",
    "the data from the pierre auger observatory show an excess in the region of centaurus a @xcite .",
    "also , the data from the telescope array observatory show a hot spot located close to the supergalactic plane @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical significance of both excesses is still quite low , and more data are required to draw any solid conclusion .",
    "the trajectories of the charged cosmic rays are bent by their interaction with the galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "heavier nuclei are more affected by these magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the presence of heavy nuclei at the highest energies would make much more difficult the identification of the sources .",
    "the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) is poorly known ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "faraday rotation measurements show that in the core of galaxy clusters the magnetic field can take values between 1 and @xmath4 g .",
    "outside clusters , upper limits to the magnetic field intensity of the parallel component to the line of sight have been obtained by using rotation measurements @xcite : @xmath5 ng mpc@xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the coherence length .",
    "recently , a new and very promising technique to constrain the igmf has been developed .",
    "it consists in the study of the effects of a non - null igmf on the propagation of gamma rays originated in blazars .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that the application of this new method to the gamma - ray emission coming from the blazar pks 2155 - 304 , leads to the exclusion of strengths of the igmf in the range @xmath8 g at the 99 % confidence level , under the assumption of a 1 mpc coherence length .",
    "note that the two methods mentioned above which are used to investigate the igmf are based on physical principles quite different .",
    "while the methods based on gamma - ray observations of blazars make use of the broadening of the angular distribution of photons and the modifications of the energy spectrum at low energies in the case of blazars with hard spectra , the technique based on the observations of faraday rotation makes use of the rotation of the polarization plane of the polarized light emitted by extragalactic objects .",
    "as mentioned before , the sources of uhecr are not identified yet .",
    "therefore , different spatial configurations of the sources give different energy spectra and , in the case of heavy nuclei at the sources , different composition profiles at earth .",
    "these ensemble fluctuations have been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case in which the sources inject either only protons or iron nuclei .",
    "moreover , in those studies the igmf was neglected . in this work ,",
    "we study the influence of a non - null igmf on the ensemble fluctuations .",
    "we also consider pure proton and iron for the injected composition , which correspond to the two limiting cases .    the paper is organized as follow . in sec .",

    "the same behavior has been found for the ensemble fluctuations of the composition profile . also , the composition becomes lighter for increasing values of the igmf intensity .",
    "as in the case of the ensemble fluctuations of the energy spectrum , the differences with the null igmf case decrease for increasing values of energy .",
    "the increase of the ensemble fluctuations can be understood from the fact that cosmic rays propagating in a non - null igmf are injected by sources that are closer .",
    "this is caused by the increase of the path length of the particles combined with their interactions with the low energy photons of the radiation field present in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the lighter composition can be explained by the increase of the path length traveled by the particles in the presence of a non - null igmf .    it has been found that , for sources injecting heavy primaries , the presence of a non - null igmf largely increases the uncertainty on the inferred luminosity of the sources , when the mean value of the flux is used to represent the energy spectrum corresponding to a particular realization of the position of the sources . also , the uncertainty on the flux shape is in some energy regions much larger for the case of a non - null igmf .",
    "these uncertainties become smaller for increasing values of the density of sources . however , for the cosmic ray and igmf models considered in this work , even for densities of the sources of the order of @xmath90 mpc@xmath87 , these uncertainties are quite large .    regarding the possible observation with the next generation of cosmic ray observatories like jem - euso , it has been demonstrated that the ensemble fluctuations on the integral energy spectrum will be easier to be observed for models including the injection of heavy nuclei combined with a non - null igmf . in any case , at least for the models considered in this work , it seems possible to observe ensemble fluctuations , even for density of sources as large as @xmath148 mpc@xmath87 , in 5 years of observation with the jem - euso telescope in nadir mode .",
