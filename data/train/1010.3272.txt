    "real world networks , i.e. those found in nature and technology , typically have a complicated irregular structure and consist of a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units . coupled biological and chemical systems , neural networks , social interacting species , and the internet are only a few such examples @xcite . because of this complexity",
    ", the first approach to capturing the global properties of such systems has been to model them as graphs whose nodes represent elements of the network and the edges define a topology ( graph of interactions ) between these elements .",
    "this a principally a static approach to modeling networks in which only the structure of the network s interactions ( and perhaps weights associated to them ) are analyzed .",
    "an additional line of research has been the investigation of the dynamical properties of such networks .",
    "this has been done by modeling network via interacting dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "important processes that are studied within this framework include synchronization @xcite or contact processes , such as opinion formation and epidemic spreading .",
    "these studies give strong evidence that the structure of a network can have a substantial impact on its dynamics @xcite .",
    "regarding this connection , the impact of a dynamical network s underlying structure on its dynamics has been of recent concern . in this",
    "the spectrum of the network s adjacency matrix has emerged as a key quantity in the study of a variety of dynamical networks .",
    "for example , systems of interacting dynamical units are known to synchronize depending only on the dynamics of the uncoupled dynamical systems and the spectral radius of the network adjacency matrix @xcite . moreover",
    ", the eigenvalues of a network are important for determining if the dynamics of a network is stable @xcite .    to aid in understanding this interplay between the structure ( graph of interactions ) and dynamics of a network",
    "we introduce in this paper the concept of an _ isospectral graph transformation_. such transformations allow one to modify the structure of a network at the level of a graph while maintaining properties related to the network s dynamics .",
    "mathematically , an isospectral graph transformation is a graph operation that modifies the structure of a graph while preserving the eigenvalues of the graph s ( weighted ) adjacency matrix .",
    "we note here that besides modifying interactions , such transforms can also reduce or increase the number of nodes in a network . as not to violate the fundamental theorem of algebra",
    ", isospectral graph transformations preserve the spectrum of the graph ( specifically number of eigenvalues ) by allowing edges to be weighted by rational functions .",
    "we note that by allowing such weights it may appear that our procedure is trading the complexity of the graph s structure for complex edge weights . however , this is not the case .",
    "in fact , it is often possible isospectrally reduce a graph in such a way that the reduced graph s edges weights belong to a particularly nice set e.g. positive integers , real numbers , or the for unweighted graphs the weight set @xmath1 ( see theorem [ maintheorem ] ) .    for a graph @xmath2 with vertex set @xmath3 this",
    "is done by reducing or expanding @xmath2 with respect to specific subsets of @xmath3 known as structural sets ( see section 3.1 for exact definitions ) . as a typical graph has many different structural sets it is possible to consider different isospectral transformations of the same graph @xmath2 as well as sequences of such transformations as a reduced graph generally has its own structural sets .    in this regard , the flexibility of this procedure is reflected in the fact that for a typical graph @xmath2 it is possible to sequentially reduce @xmath2 to a graph on any nonempty subset of its original vertex set .",
    "this follows from an existence and uniqueness result regarding sequences of isospectral reductions .",
    "that is a typical graph @xmath2 can be uniquely reduced to a graph on any nonempty subset of its vertices ( see theorem [ theorem-1 ] and theorem [ theorem0.1 ] ) . because of this uniqueness , isospectral graph reductions can be used to induce new equivalence relations on the set of all graphs under some mild assumptions .",
    "namely , two graphs ( networks ) are _ spectrally equivalent _ if they can by isospectrally reduced to one and the same graph .    in the study of complex networks , there is a need to find ways of reducing complexity while maintaining some important network characteristic(s ) .",
    "this amounts to course graining or finding the right scale at which to view the network .",
    "isospectral network transformations , specifically reductions , serve this need by allowing one to view a network as smaller network with essentially the same spectrum .",
    "finding the right scale here then amounts to finding the right structural set over which to reduce the network .    of primary interest is the fact that isospectral network transformations suggest other useful transformations on interacting dynamical systems i.e. dynamical networks .",
    "an important example in this paper is a _ dynamical network expansion _ in which a dynamical network is modified in a way that preserves its dynamics but alters its associated graph structure .",
    "such transforms provide a new tool for the study of the interplay between the structure ( topology ) and dynamics of dynamical networks .",
    "much as general dynamical systems are investigated via change of coordinates , isospectral network transforms introduce a mechanism for rearranging the specific ( graph ) structure of a system while preserving its dynamics in an essential way . by so doing the original network s dynamics",
    "can be investigated by studying the transformed dynamical network .",
    "specifically , we generalize the results given in @xcite by showing in this paper that the existence of a global attracting fixed point of a network can be established by investigating one of its expansions when direct investigation of the network does not .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2 we present notation and some general definitions .",
    "section 3 contains the description of an isospectral graph transformation and results on sequences of such transformations .",
    "graph transformations over fixed weight sets and spectral equivalence are treated in section 4 .",
    "the proof of results contained in sections 3 and 4 are then given in section 5 . in section 6",
    "the behavior of dynamical networks is investigated via dynamical network expansions and the condition of global stability is obtained .",
    "section 7 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper we are primarily interested in the topology ( graph structure ) of dynamical networks .",
    "we consider the most general class of networks ( with fixed topology i.e. the graph of interactions does not change in time ) , namely those networks whose graph of interactions are finite , directed , with loops and with edge weights in the set @xmath4 .",
    "such graphs form the class @xmath5 .",
    "a graph @xmath6 is an ordered triple @xmath7 where @xmath3 and @xmath8 are the _ vertex set _ and _ edge set _ of @xmath2 respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 gives the _ edge weights _ of @xmath2 where @xmath10 if and only if @xmath11 .",
    "the set @xmath4 is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath12 $ ] be the set of polynomials in the complex variable @xmath13 with complex coefficients .",
    "the set @xmath4 is the set of rational functions of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 $ ] , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have no common factors ( roots ) , and @xmath18 .",
    "we note that the set @xmath4 is a subfield of the field of rational functions over @xmath19 .",
    "if the vertex set of the graph @xmath7 is labeled @xmath20 we denote an edge from @xmath21 to @xmath22 by @xmath23 . the matrix @xmath24 defined entrywise by @xmath25 is then the _ weighted adjacency matrix _ of @xmath2 . the _ spectrum _ or _ eigenvalues _ of a matrix @xmath26 are the solutions including multiplicities to the equation @xmath27 for the graph @xmath2 we let @xmath28 be the spectrum of @xmath29 .",
    "the spectrum of a matrix with entries in @xmath4 is therefore a generalization of the spectrum of a matrix with complex entries .",
    "moreover , as @xmath30 is the ratio of two polynomials @xmath31 let @xmath32 be the solutions including multiplicities of the equation @xmath33 .",
    "both @xmath28 and @xmath32 are _ lists _ of numbers .",

    "in this section we formally describe the isospectral reduction process and the associated isospectral graph expansions .",
    "we then give specific examples of this method and present some results regarding sequences of isospectral reductions and spectral equivalence of graphs .      as a typical graph @xmath6",

    "the flexibility and commutativity of such reductions is particularly useful . moreover ,",
    "isospectral reductions are also relevant to the theory of networks as they provide a flexible means of course graining networks ( i.e. viewing the network at some appropriate scale ) while simultaneously introducing new equivalence relations on the space of all networks .    the second type of transformations we presented in this paper were isospectral graph transformations over fixed weight sets . such transformations allow one to transform an arbitrary graph while preserving the graph s set of edge weights and spectrum along with the its spectrum .",

    "dynamical network expansions modify a dynamical network in a way that preserves network dynamics but alters its associated graph structure ( graph of interactions ) . in this paper",
    "we demonstrated that this procedure allows one to establish global stability of a more general class of dynamical networks than considered in @xcite .",
    "that is , such expansions provide more information and can be used to obtain stronger results regarding network dynamics than the original ( unexpanded ) network .",
    "lastly , the results of the present paper introduce various approaches to simplifying a graph s structure while maintaining its spectrum .",
    "therefore , these techniques can be used for optimal design , in the sense of structure simplicity of dynamical networks with prescribed dynamical properties ranging from synchronizability to chaoticity @xcite .",
