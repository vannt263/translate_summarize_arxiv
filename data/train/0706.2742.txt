    "closed string tachyons are very important spectra in string theory since they signal the decay of background space - time geometry into others , thus it is likely that these tachyon condensations play crucial roles in quantum gravity .",
    "however , compared with the developments of open string tachyon condensation @xcite , the dynamics of closed string tachyon condensation is not so well - understood , despite with the pioneer work done for the localized closed string tachyon in ale spaces @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "significant progresses have been made on ads / cft correspondence @xcite , which gives a useful tool to understand the nature of quantum gravity from the well - defined gauge theory point of view .",
    "therefore , we could expect to obtain a lot of insights by investigating the fate of localized closed string tachyons if we embed them into asymptotically ads spaces .",
    "first let us recall the known results on the condensation of localized closed string tachyon .",
    "for instance , superstrings on @xmath9 were analyzed in @xcite , where the orbifold is constructed as the two dimensional plane divided by the symmetry of @xmath10 rotation .",
    "the target space is a cone and closed strings can be localized at the tip of the cone .",
    "suppose we choose odd @xmath11 and anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions , then the spectrum of closed strings includes no bulk tachyons but localized tachyons .",
    "an amazing conjecture was given in @xcite that a localized tachyon condensation leads @xmath9 into @xmath12 with odd @xmath3 and finally the system ends up with the stable supersymmetric flat vacuum .",
    "the conjecture was confirmed by various ways , such as , d - brane probes , worldsheet rg - flow , and so on . in particular",
    ", exact gravity solutions describing the decay of @xmath9 were obtained in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the condensation of localized closed string tachyons in superstring theory on @xmath13 with @xmath14 , which is constructed by the @xmath15 dimensional ads space with the identification of @xmath10 rotation .",
    "the orbifold procedure gives rise to a fixed point at the center , and we can construct systems with no bulk tachyons but with tachyons localized at the fixed point by choosing proper spin structures as for @xmath9 case . considering localized tachyon condensations in asymptotic ads spaces , we can make intriguing observations which can not be seen for the cases of flat space orbifolds . due to the warped factor",
    ", the effect of closed string tachyons is localized around the fix point of ads orbifold , and hence the back - reaction by tachyons induces only normalizable modes but not non - normalizable modes .",
    "this implies that the localized tachyon condensation changes only bulk physics but not the boundary conditions .",
    "this should be compared to the @xmath9 case , where the boundary conditions are altered through the tachyon condensation .",
    "in fact , it was argued in @xcite that the localized tachyon condensation of @xmath0 deforms the geometry into so - called eguchi - hanson soliton @xcite with the same boundary conditions as for the ads orbifold .",
    "this fact is actually very important since in an asymptotically ads space we can deal with all the geometries with the same boundary condition at the same time .",
    "for instance , we can discuss the thermal phase structure of gravity theory in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "utilizing the ads / cft correspondence , we can discuss the condensation in terms of dual gauge theory . in the global coordinates ,",
    "the boundary of @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the time direction and the @xmath20 dimensional sphere , respectively .",
    "since the orbifold action acts also on the boundary of @xmath16 , the dual gauge theory is defined by the orbifold of gauge theory on @xmath17 .",
    "one of the important facts for the orbifold gauge theory is that the theory has many vacua labeled by the holonomy matrix along its non - trivial cycle .",
    "it is natural to propose that the condensation of localized tachyon is dual to the assignment of non - trivial holonomy , because it is known that the deformation by normalizable modes corresponds to giving expectation values to dual operators .",
    "notice that this is related to the fact that the localized tachyon condensation does not change the boundary condition as mentioned before . in this way , we can analyze the tachyon condensation in terms of dual gauge theory as a transition between different vacua .",
    "in particular , the casimir energies for the vacua of dual gauge theory on @xmath21 were computed in @xcite , and it was found that they reproduce quite well the masses of dual geometries .",
    "one of the purpose of this paper is to extend the analysis on the localized tachyon condensation of @xmath0 @xcite into the case of @xmath1 . up to now only the comparison between the static geometries deformed by localized tachyon condensation and",
    "the vacua of dual gauge theory has been done .",
    "so we would like to investigate the dynamics of localized tachyon condensation both from the bulk and boundary points of view . in section [ ads3 ]",
    "we study the localized tachyon condensation on @xmath1 with odd @xmath11 .",
    "first we observe that the geometry after the tachyon condensation is @xmath2 with odd @xmath22 and the final geometry is given by @xmath23 without orbifolding .",
    "next we study the decay of @xmath1 following a dilaton pulse , which is induced by a localized tachyon condensation .",
    "we solve numerically the einstein - dilaton equations in order to obtain a time - dependent gravity solution describing the decay .",
    "the gauge theory dual to @xmath1 is defined on @xmath24 , and the holonomy matrix along the spatial cycle leads to different vacua .",
    "the casimir energies for the vacua of the gauge theory are computed and exact matches are found between the casimir energies and the masses of dual geometries . in section [ ads5 ]",
    "we first review the result of @xcite , where it was discussed that @xmath0 decays into eguchi - hanson solution @xcite .",
    "the dual gauge theory is defined on @xmath5 , and the vacua with different holonomy correspond to the different geometries deformed by localized tachyon condensation . in subsection [ gauge5 ]",
    "we construct instanton solutions of the orbifold gauge theory on @xmath5 with the help of instanton solutions on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the instanton solutions interpolate different vacua , which are dual to the transitions between different geometries .",
    "we start from extending the results of @xcite into @xmath1 case .",
    "we find that the decay process of @xmath1 is quite similar to the one of @xmath9 , namely , @xmath1 decays into @xmath2 with @xmath3 and ends up with pure @xmath23 .",
    "making use of this similarity , we analyze in subsection [ gravity ] the dynamics of localized tachyon condensation .",
    "a localized tachyon condensation leads to a dilaton pulse , which travels from the fixed point into the ads boundary .",
    "the back - reaction of this dilaton pulse induces the decay of @xmath1 into @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "we try to find a time - dependent gravity solution describing the decay in a numerical way .",
    "the boundary of @xmath1 is given by @xmath24 , and the dual gauge theory is defined on the boundary . in subsection [ gauge3 ]",
    "we define the dual gauge theory and find the spectrum for various vacua with non - trivial holonomy .",
    "the casimir energies of the vacua are computed , and they are shown to match precisely with the masses of dual geometries .",
    "let us consider type iib superstring theory on @xmath25 .",
    "in the global coordinates , the metric of @xmath23 is given by @xmath26 the orbifold of @xmath23 can be constructed from the identification of @xmath27 , which gives rise to a fixed point at @xmath28 . following the arguments of @xcite on @xmath9 , we can construct the configuration with no bulk tachyons and only tachyons localized at @xmath28 by assuming an odd integer @xmath11 and anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions .",
    "here we have used the fact that local properties do not depend on the curvature of ads space . from the experience of the flat orbifold case ,",
    "it is natural to guess that the condensation of localized tachyon deforms the orbifold @xmath1 into @xmath2 with odd @xmath3 and finally into the stable supersymmetric vacuum with @xmath23 .",
    "it is very difficult to prove this conjecture since we do not fully understand the localized closed string tachyon .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain several supports for this conjecture if we utilize the properties of asymptotic ads space .",
    "suppose that the potential of localized tachyonic modes has various minima at finite configurations .",
    "then the tachyon condensation leads to the deformation of normalizable modes , which ends up with a deformed geometry with the same boundary condition .",
    "in fact , we can show that @xmath29 can be deformed into @xmath2 with odd @xmath3 without changing the boundary behavior .",
    "moreover , we observe that the background mass decreases as @xmath30 becomes small and the smallest mass is given by @xmath23 within the configurations with fixed boundary condition .    in order to describe the @xmath2 geometry with a fixed boundary condition ,",
    "it is not appropriate to use the metric with the identification @xmath31 since the boundary condition manifestly depends on the choice of @xmath30 .",
    "instead we use the following metric as @xmath32 the period of @xmath33 is set as @xmath34 and the parameter @xmath35 is related to @xmath36 as @xmath37 utilizing the coordinate transformation @xmath38 we can indeed rewrite the above metric into the form of with the periodicity @xmath39 .",
    "the boundary behavior of the metric in the form does not depend on the parameter @xmath40 , therefore we can express all the orbifolds @xmath2 @xmath41 with the same boundary condition as for @xmath29 .",
    "notice that @xmath30 should be odd since only the case with odd @xmath30 is consistent with the anti - periodic conditions for fermions at the ads boundary .",
    "an advantage to embed into an ads space is that the mass of geometry is well - defined in an asymptotically ads space . utilizing this fact we can analyze the stability of geometries by comparing the masses of geometry .",
    "here we follow the methods developed in @xcite . for an asymptotically ads space we can expand the metric for large @xmath42 as @xmath43 where @xmath44 contains the lower powers of @xmath42 .",
    "then the mass of geometry can be computed by using the formula @xcite @xmath45 with the three dimensional newton constant @xmath46 .",
    "we find from the metric @xmath47 thus the mass of the geometry is given by @xmath48 from this mass formula , we can show that the mass of geometry is largest for the original geometry with @xmath49 and becomes smaller as we decrease @xmath30 .",
    "the final geometry should be given by @xmath23 with @xmath50 , which is stable since it has the smallest mass and no localized tachyon .",
    "furthermore , the supersymmetry is recovered in the final geometry .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we have conjectured that the localized tachyon condensation leads to the decay of the orbifold @xmath1 into @xmath2 @xmath41 with a smaller deficit angle .",
    "the dynamical process may be given as follows .",
    "tachyons localized at the fixed point could roll down the potential and reach to minima .",
    "the energy due to the tachyon condensation would be carried out by a dilaton pulse from the center to the boundary of the ads orbifold .",
    "the dilaton pulse can serve as a moving domain wall , and the geometry decays into @xmath2 @xmath41 after the pulse passed away . for @xmath51",
    "this scenario was conjectured in @xcite and the exact gravity solution was found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that it is difficult to analyze the condensation of closed string tachyon in general , since the condensation changes the background itself and we do not know how to deal with this case . an advantage to localize",
    "the tachyon is that the effects of tachyon condensation are confined in a stringy regime , and hence we can safely use the classical gravity description to describe the decay of the ads orbifold for later time . as mentioned above",
    "we assume that the effect of localized tachyon induces a dilaton pulse traveling from the center to the ads boundary .",
    "thus now the problem is to find out the solution of graviton - dilaton system corresponding to the decay of ads orbifold with a dilaton pulse .",
    "the action we consider for graviton and dilaton is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ricci scalar with respect to the metric @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the dilaton field .",
    "the determinant is denoted as @xmath56 , and the ricci tensor will be represented as @xmath57 .",
    "the negative cosmological constant is related as @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ ads3 ] ) and we fix it as @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 for a while .    from the action for graviton and dilaton ,",
    "we can read off the equations of motion for graviton as @xmath61 and for dilaton as @xmath62 in order to solve the einstein - dilaton equations , we set up an initial configuration at an initial time @xmath63 , and follow the evolutions of metric and dilaton by solving these equations .",
    "since the @xmath64 components of einstein equations ( [ einsteineq ] ) contain only terms at most involving first derivative with respective to time @xmath65 and contain no second or higher time derivatives , we treat these equations as constraint equations for initial data .",
    "this is because these equations do not tell anything about time evolution .",
    "we treat the rest , spatial components of einstein equations , which involve second order time derivatives , as dynamical evolution equations .",
    "since some components of einstein equations are treated as constraint equations , now the number of differential equations is smaller than that of degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , we have to remove several components of metric by utilizing the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry",
    ". we can always choose the metric in the form of @xmath66 here we have removed @xmath33-dependence of the metric by making use of the symmetry of the system .",
    "the dilaton field is also set to be independent of @xmath33 .",
    "the conformal transformation of @xmath67 is a residual diffeomorphism which does not change the form of , and the residual gauge can be fixed by assigning appropriate boundary conditions at @xmath28 and initial configuration at the initial time @xmath63 .    in terms of the metric form , the geometries before and after the tachyon condensation are given as follows .",
    "the metric of the initial geometry @xmath29 is @xmath68 which is obtained by replacing @xmath42 of with @xmath69 by coordinate transformation @xmath70 and rewriting @xmath71 . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the ads boundary is located at @xmath72 .",
    "after the tachyon condensation the geometry is proposed to be @xmath2 , whose metric can be written as @xmath73 with @xmath74 as before .",
    "actually it is convenient for the later purpose to rewrite as @xmath75 by rescaling coordinates as @xmath76 .",
    "if we take @xmath77 limit , then the metric reduces to the one used in @xcite for @xmath9 . as a result , comparison to @xmath9 is more manifest in this metric , even though the radial boundary is shifted along the tachyon condensation from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "let us write down the explicit form of equations of motion by using the metric .",
    "the constraint equations arise from @xmath80 components of einstein equations as @xmath81 which do not include second derivatives at it should be the case . here",
    "we have used @xmath82 such that the equations become simpler . note that the @xmath83 component is empty due to the @xmath33-independence .",
    "we will use below these equations to set up initial configurations and to check the reliability of our computation .",
    "the non - trivial parts of evolution equations come from @xmath84 and @xmath85 components as @xmath86 it is possible to solve these equations directly , but it might be useful take a linear combination of einstein equations to make the equations simpler .",
    "notice that the einstein equations can be reduced to a simpler form in this case as @xmath87 we pick up @xmath88 and @xmath89 components as evolution equations @xmath90 where we have used @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , there is no dependence of dilaton in the @xmath89 component . in this notation ,",
    "the equation of motion for dilaton is written as @xmath93 in the following we will try to solve the three evolution equations and for three unknowns @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , this is equivalent to solve and since we have just picked up a specific linear combination .    in order to solve the evolution equations we have to set up boundary conditions at @xmath72 .",
    "this choice is reliable only when we follow the evolution before the dilaton pulse reaches to the boundary as below .",
    "] at the center @xmath28 and an initial configuration at @xmath63 .",
    "at @xmath28 we set @xmath95 since the cycle of @xmath33 should shrink at @xmath28 .",
    "then the regularity of requires the neumann boundary condition as @xmath96 at @xmath28 .",
    "we also assign @xmath97 at @xmath28 , which follows the regularity of .",
    "this condition should be related to the regularity of since we have just picked up a linear combination .",
    "now that we are trying to solve second order differential equations for three unknowns , we should assign 6 initial conditions for @xmath98 and @xmath99 at @xmath63 . at the initial time",
    "we have argued that the tachyon condensation makes a dilaton pulse , which should be determined from the string theory computation in principle .",
    "since it is a rather hard task , we simply assume that the localized tachyon induces a static dilaton pulse with the gaussian form as @xmath100 the normalisation @xmath101 and the width @xmath102 of the pulse should be related to the localized tachyon condensation and therefore to the decay process .",
    "we also assume that the decay starts from a static configuration and hence we set @xmath103 at @xmath63 .",
    "the other intimal conditions are for @xmath104 and @xmath105 at @xmath63 .",
    "due to the assumption of static initial configuration , the second equation of vanishes .",
    "therefore , once we fix one of the initial conditions , then the other is determined from the first constraint equation .",
    "we fix it from the flat space limit .",
    "near @xmath28 we can neglect the cosmological constant , thus the change of metric can be close to the one in @xcite .",
    "they fix @xmath106 , independent of dilaton pulse , with the help of the residual diffeomorphism , thus we may set @xmath107 at @xmath63",
    ". then @xmath104 at @xmath63 is determined by solving the first constraint equation .",
    "because of this choice of initial configuration , we expect that the decay of @xmath1 is closed to the one of @xmath9 at least near @xmath28 .",
    "in particular , the metric of the final geometry should be given as in .",
    "right now we have sufficient boundary conditions to solve the three evolution equations and .",
