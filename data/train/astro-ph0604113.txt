    "special circumstances are required to produce a long gamma - ray burst ( grb ) . while it has now been firmly established that these events result from the death of very massive stars ( e.g. , galama et al .",
    "1998 ; stanek et al .  2003 ) , there are two crucial features that distinguish progenitors of long grbs from the vast majority of other core collapse supernovae .",
    "first , there is strong evidence that grbs are highly beamed ( e.g. , stanek et al .",
    "1999 ; rhoads 1999 ) ; second , the optically detected supernovae are all type ic , lacking both hydrogen and helium in their spectra ( e.g. , stanek et al .  2003 ; modjaz et al .  2006 ; mazzali et al .  2006 ; mirabal et al .",
    "this combination of properties explains why they are so rare .",
    "the presence of a jet naturally implies rapid core rotation , which has been suggested by theoretical studies ( e.g. , woosley 1993 ) ; it is also easier for a jet to penetrate the thin envelope of a star that has experienced strong mass loss .",
    "however , the extensive mass loss ( increasing with metallicity ) required to produce type ic supernovae would normally also cause extensive angular momentum loss . in this paper , we directly assess whether such special circumstances exist by directly comparing grb hosts metallicity to the metallicity of star forming galaxies in the local universe .",
    "studies of grb hosts at @xmath8 reveal that they are underluminous compared to the general population of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , le floch et al .",
    "2003 ; fruchter et al .",
    "2006 ) , suggesting that grbs occur preferentially at low metallicities .",
    "in our analysis we study the five low redshift ( @xmath9 ) grbs , a complete sample of `` local '' bursts identified so far . in all cases these grbs",
    "were followed by well - documented supernovae .",
    "this sample now includes grb060218 , whose host is fainter than the small magellanic cloud ( modjaz et al .",
    "there are several reasons why this sample is worth a separate study .",
    "good abundance information exists for the hosts of all five events , and it can be compared directly and using the same techniques to the sample of local star - forming galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) spanning approximately the same redshift range .",
    "the highest redshift in the sample , @xmath10 , corresponds to look back time of @xmath11 of the age of the earth , about the time when life on earth could be affected by grb radiation . at these small distances",
    "we might also see other impacts of grbs , such as production of cosmic rays and shell remnants .",
    "with five well - studied events at hand , for the first time there are enough data in this interesting redshift range to make a direct and statistically significant empirical study .",
    "this investigation complements the high-@xmath4 studies and it _ directly _ addresses the properties of nearby grbs and their hosts , in case they are different .",
    "the main result of our analysis is to show that the oxygen abundances of the five hosts , which range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 of the solar value , are much lower than would be expected if local grbs traced local star formation independently of metallicity .",
    "we conclude that grbs are restricted to metal - poor stellar populations , in agreement with recent theoretical models of their progenitors ( e.g. , yon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) , and that the milky way and other large spirals have been too metal - rich to host grbs for the last several billion years ( see also langer & norman 2006 ) .",
    "we discuss several implications of this result .",
    "we also find that the @xmath14ray isotropic energy release , @xmath6 , for these five grbs declines with increasing oxygen abundance of the host galaxy , and suggest that the oxygen abundance threshold for a `` cosmological '' grb ( visible at high redshifts ) may be as low as 0.15 of the solar value .",
    "are the properties of long duration grb hosts unusual compared with the properties of normal galaxies in the local universe ?",
    "we can address this question by comparing the physical characteristics of local grb hosts directly to the same quantities for local galaxies in the sdss .",
    "tremonti et al .  (",
    "2004 ) determine metallicities for a large sample of sdss galaxies from their spectra .",
    "the redshifts of that sample are restricted to @xmath1 , providing a good comparison sample to the local grb hosts .",
    "the metallicities are derived by a likelihood analysis which compares multiple nebular emission lines ( [ ] , h@xmath15 , [ ] , h@xmath16 , [ ] , [ ] ) to the predictions of the hybrid stellar - population plus photoionization models of charlot & longhetti ( 2001 ) .",
    "a particular combination of nebular emission line ratios arises from a model galaxy that is characterized by a galaxy - averaged metallicity , ionization parameter , dust - to - metal ratio , and 5500  dust attenuation . for each galaxy ,",
    "a likelihood distribution for metallicity is constructed by comparison to a large library of model galaxies .",
    "the median of this distribution is taken to be the galaxy metallicity , and the width of the distribution is taken to be the error on the metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig_tremonti ] shows the galaxies from the extended sample of  73,000 star - forming sdss galaxies studied by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in the metallicity - luminosity plane .",
    "we now add to this diagram the local grb hosts .",
    "the large filled dots in figure  [ fig_tremonti ] mark the locations of three previous grb / sn hosts ( sn1998bw , sn2003dh , sn2003lw ) with values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 taken mostly from sollerman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ( see table  1 for references ) .",
    "in addition , we show the host of a very recent grb060218/sn2006aj , whose host galaxy has @xmath19 and sub - smc luminosity ( modjaz et al .",
    "we also add a host of grb020903 ( soderberg et al .",
    "2005 ; bersier et al .",
    "2006 ) , which had a clear supernova signature in its light curve , and was at fairly low redshift @xmath10 .",
    "oxygen abundance for the host of grb020903 has been recently measured by hammer et al .",
    "the symbol areas for the grb points in figure  1 are scaled with isotropic @xmath20-ray energy release @xmath21 for each burst ( see table  1 ) , ranging from @xmath22ergs for grb 980425 to @xmath23erg for grb030329 .",
    "there seems to be a progression of @xmath6 towards lower energies with increasing oxygen abundance , which we will discuss later in the paper .",
    "as discussed in sollerman et al .",
    ", the applied @xmath24 metallicity diagnostic ( following kewley & dopita 2002 ) , which employs emission line ratios of [ ] , [ ] and h@xmath15 , is double - valued .",
    "the degeneracy between the lower and upper oxygen abundance branch can be broken by taking into account other emission lines , e.g. , [ ] .",
    "for the host of grb030329 , sollerman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) could not break the degeneracy due to the non - detection of [ ] , so they stated two possible values for @xmath18 , namely 8.6 and 7.9 .",
    "using the published line ratios by sollerman et al .  and gorosabel et al .  ( 2005 ) , we consult nagao , maiolino & marconi ( 2006 ) who point to another emission line diagnostic , namely [ ] @xmath25@xmath26[]@xmath27 , that can give leverage in distinguishing between the two branches .",
    "according to nagao et al .",
    ", when that ratio is above 2 , the lower branch is favored , and we find a value of 2.11 for that ratio . the lower value of @xmath28 for the host of grb030329 is also preferred by gorosabel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and seems more likely given its low luminosity ",
    "the upper branch would predict a much brighter host galaxy according to the luminosity - metallicity relationship . for grb020903 hammer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) derive @xmath19 , using the effective temperature method .",
    "that method has a significant offset from the kewley & dopita ( 2002 ) scale , so using the published values of line fluxes in table  1 of hammer et al .",
    "we apply the prescription of kewley & dopita and obtain @xmath29 . if we were instead to use the formula from the very recent work of kewley & ellison ( 2006 ) to convert from the effective temperature method to the kewley & dopita method , we would add an offset of @xmath30dex , in excellent agreement with the previous value .",
    "we therefor adopt the final value of oxygen abundance of @xmath31 for the host of grb020903 .",
    ".properties of the local grbs / sne and their hosts [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    we conclude that even this fairly small sample of low-@xmath4 grb hosts is sufficient to show that grbs do not trace the overall star formation in the local universe ( and do no trace mass at extremely high confidence ) . instead ,",
    "grbs arise preferentially in the lowest metallicity systems . in figure  [ fig_tremonti ]",
    ", it is striking that grb 031203 , which has the brightest host galaxy , resides in a system that is extremely metal - poor compared to other galaxies of its luminosity .",
    "equally intriguing is the trend for brighter grbs to occupy the lowest metallicity hosts .",
    "figure  [ fig_gamma ] illustrates this point directly , plotting the isotropic @xmath14ray energy release @xmath6 against @xmath32 ( for an earlier , indirect attempt to correlate @xmath6 with host metallicity see fig.1 in ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "the low energies of the low-@xmath4 grbs have been discussed by many authors ever since the discovery of grb 980425 . in principle",
    "the low values of @xmath6 could arise from beaming effects , with the proximity of the bursts allowing us to see them further off - axis , but cobb et al .",
    "( 2006 ) argue persuasively against this interpretation .",
    "if @xmath6 is reasonably representative of the true energetics of these low-@xmath4 grbs , then figure  [ fig_gamma ] suggests that there may be a threshold for producing truly `` cosmological '' grbs that are bright enough to be seen to high redshift , at an oxygen abundance @xmath33 , roughly 0.15 of the solar abundance .",
    "we caution that this trend is rather speculative given the current data , unlike the main result of our of paper , i.e. , that local grbs occur only in metal - poor galaxies .",
    "our findings for local grbs are in qualitative agreement with the studies showing that high - redshift grbs reside in underluminous galaxies ( e.g. , le floch et al .",
    "2003 ; fruchter et al .",
    "the advantage of studying the local sample is that we can focus directly on metallicity , which appears to be the critical physical parameter , and we can compare the grb host metallicities to those measured in local star - forming galaxies . the arguments in  2 and  3 indicate that long grbs occur only in low metallicity environments , and therefore do not occur in `` normal '' galaxies that are comparable to the milky way in mass and metallicity .",
    "this has a number of implications , some of which have been discussed independently by langer & norman ( 2006 ) based on an entirely different line of argument involving higher-@xmath4 grbs .",
    "our results agree well with recent theoretical work on grb progenitors .",
    "the collapsar model , where the grb is created by an accretion disk around a rotating black hole , requires the core angular momentum of the progenitor to be dynamically important at the time of collapse .",
    "this requirement sets severe limits on core angular momentum loss , which would normally accompany the substantial mass loss associated with the wolf - rayet stars thought to be the progenitors of typical type ic supernovae .",
    "two viable channels have been proposed , both of which avoid the red supergiant phase .",
    "first , interactions with a close binary companion can strip the envelope too rapidly for the core to be spun down ( see podsiadlowski et al .  2004 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "second , a single star that rotates rapidly enough can experience fully mixed evolution ( yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) and avoid the red supergiant phase entirely .",
    "the latter mechanism also avoids core contraction during the hydrogen and helium burning phases , which would further shield the core from angular momentum loss associated with magnetic fields ( spruit 2002 ; however , see denissenkov & pinsonneault 2006 ) . with either of these mechanisms ,",
    "however , grbs would not be expected for high iron abundances because of strong mass and angular momentum loss during either the main sequence or the wolf - rayet phase ( heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "yoon & langer ( 2005 ) and woosley & heger ( 2006 ) estimate that an iron abundance of about 0.1 solar is a maximum threshold for such a mechanism .",
    "the existence of a strong metallicity threshold therefore provides support for recent theoretical models of the formation of long grbs , and with better statistics we may be able to distinguish between the different formation channels .",
    "the iron abundance is more important than the oxygen abundance in this regard because iron provides much of the opacity for radiation - driven stellar winds ( e.g. , pauldrach , puls , & kudritzki 1986 ) .",
    "our use of oxygen as a proxy for metallicity may therefore underestimate the significance of the abundance trends that we observe .",
    "the earliest generations of stars are known to be enhanced in [ o / fe ] relative to the solar mixture ( lambert , sneden & ries 1974 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that the grb host galaxies are even more iron - poor than they  are oxygen - poor .",
    "the specific frequency of wolf - rayet stars relative to o stars is an order of magnitude higher in high metallicity spirals than it is in systems such as the smc ( maeder & conti 1994 ) . since normal type ic supernovae",
    "are associated with wolf - rayet progenitors , the low metallicity of the five local grb hosts is even more significant , as type ic supernovae in general trace metal - rich star formation .",
    "an upper limit on metallicity for long grbs has a number of other consequences .",
    "grbs are unlikely to be a source of cosmic rays in the milky way ( a possibility discussed by , e.g. , dermer 2002 ) , and they can play only a limited role in cosmic ray production in the low - redshift universe",
    ". searches for grb remnants in nearby large galaxies ( e.g. , loeb & perna 1998 ) are expected to yield few , if any , detections .",
    "we also argue that asymmetric supernovae remnants observed in the milky way did not result from recent grb explosions ( e.g. , fesen et al .",
    "2006 ; laming et al .",
    "it also follows that late - time non - detections of radio emission from local core - collapse supernovae ( e.g. , soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) , while providing interesting constraints on their physics , do not provide information on the beaming or circumstellar environments of grbs .",
    "these core - collapse sne are most likely located in higher metallicity galaxies that are unlikely to produce a grb .",
    "a grb occurring in the last billion years within a few kiloparsecs from earth has been invoked as a possible cause for a mass extinction episode ( e.g. , thomas et al .  2005a , b ) .",
    "our results make this scenario most unlikely  by the time the earth formed , the milky way disk was already too metal - rich to host a long grb .",
    "sn1998bw / grb980425 , the only local event to happen in a fairly metal - enriched galaxy , was also by far the weakest localized grb ever , with at least 10,000 times lower energy than a typical @xmath8 grb . as such",
    ", it would not cause mass extinction at several kpc from earth .",
    "the same can be said about short grbs , which are not only less frequent than long grbs ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) , but also less energetic and less beamed ( e.g. , grupe et al .  2006 ; panaitescu 2006 ) .",
    "short grbs are also not concentrated to star - forming regions , thus on average they are much further away from any life - hosting planets ( e.g. , bloom & prochaska 2006 ) . in addition ,",
    "planet - hosting stars are on average even more metal rich than the sun ( e.g. , santos , israelian & mayor 2004 ) , making long grbs an even less likely source of life extinction events in the local universe .",
    "so to finish with a bit of good news , we can probably cross grbs off the rather long list of things that could cause humankind to `` join the dinosaurs '' on the extinct species list .",
