    "the _ ab initio _ calculation of hadron mass spectra and observables in terms of their underlying quark and gluon degrees of freedom remains a significant challenge to theoretical physics .",
    "bound state problems in a quantum field theory such as qcd are inherently non - perturbative .",
    "hadron problems are also many - body in nature and must be solved at strong coupling . due to the complexity of the problem , seemingly simple quantities , such as the proton magnetic moment , have not yet been accurately calculated .",
    "observables of interest include the mass spectrum of the hadronic system ( in particular `` exotic '' states with quantum numbers beyond the constituent quark model ) , along with properties of the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "these include transition and decay rates , electric and magnetic moments , form factors , structure functions and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) @xcite is a promising tool for tackling hadron problems from first principles .",
    "blfq is a hamiltonian - based approach that combines the advantages of light - front dynamics @xcite with modern developments in _ ab initio _ nuclear structure calculations , such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite .",
    "the similarity of light - front hamiltonian quantum field theory to non - relativistic quantum many - body theory allows the quantum field theoretical bound state problem to be formulated as a large , sparse matrix diagonalization problem .",
    "state - of - the - art methods developed for ncsm calculations can then be used to address hadronic systems @xcite .",
    "the diagonalization of the light - front hamiltonian in a fock - space basis yields the mass eigenstates of the system , along with amplitudes for evaluating non - perturbative observables .",
    "recent works have successfully applied blfq to the single - electron problem in qed in order to evaluate the electron anomalous magnetic moment both with @xcite and without @xcite an external trap .",
    "another recent application evaluates the electron gpds @xcite .",
    "in addition , blfq has been extended to time - dependent strong external field problems ( tblfq ) such as non - linear compton scattering @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the positronium system as a test case for applying blfq to self - bound systems .",
    "our primary purpose is to confirm that blfq is capable of generating the expected bohr spectrum of positronium , including relativistic effects such as the hyperfine splitting of the ground state .    for this initial test case",
    ", we implement a two - body effective interaction that operates only in the lowest fock sector .",
    "the effective interaction implements the one - photon - exchange kernel necessary for coulomb binding , but neglects the fermion self energy . in future applications involving dynamical photons in the basis",
    ", a non - perturbative renormalization scheme will be needed to deal with fermion self - energy effects .",
    "we intend to use the results of this calculation as a benchmark for implementing a fock - sector dependent renormalization scheme .",
    "we begin by introducing the basic elements of blfq , such as our choice of basis and truncation scheme .",
    "we then detail the derivation of the two - body effective interaction and solve for the spectrum of positronium using this interaction . finally , we examine in detail the dependence of the results on the regulators of our theory .",
    "preliminary results were reported in refs .",
    "in principle , hadron observables can be evaluated by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy - momentum 4-vector operator . in blfq",
    ", we express the operator @xmath3 in light - cone gauge .",
    "the operator @xmath3 then plays the role of the hamiltonian operator in non - relativisitic quantum mechanics . as such , it is sometimes referred as the `` light - cone hamiltonian '' @xmath4 .",
    "( note that in this convention the `` hamiltonian '' has energy squared units . )",
    "this operator can be derived from any field theoretical lagrangian via the legendre transform . in blfq , eq . is expressed in a truncated basis , and the resulting finite - dimensional matrix is diagonalized numerically .",
    "one then examines the trends in observables as the basis truncation is relaxed to estimate the results in the infinite matrix ( or `` continuum '' ) limit .",
    "of course @xmath5 , being field theoretical in origin , contains terms which change particle number .",
    "thus the basis space for performing a diagonalization must be expanded to include states with any number or species of particles .",
    "for example , the positronium wavefunction could be expressed schematically as @xmath6 when @xmath5 is derived from the qed or qcd lagrangian , the resulting interactions change particle number by at most two .",
    "the resulting matrix will then be extremely sparse for a many - body calculation .      in order to numerically diagonalize @xmath5",
    ", the infinite dimensional basis must be truncated down to a finite dimension . in blfq , three separate truncations are made .",
    "first , the number of fock sectors in the basis is truncated .",
    "this truncation will be based on physical as well as practical considerations .",
    "for instance , positronium is expected to be fairly well described by the lowest few sectors .",
    "thus , in this introductory work , we limit ourselves to only the @xmath7 and @xmath8 sectors .",
    "we do not make any attempt here to examine the limit of increasing the number of fock sectors .    secondly , we discretize the longitudinal momentum by putting our system in a longitudinal box of length @xmath9 and applying periodic boundary conditions ( bcs ) . specifically , we choose periodic bcs for bosons and anti - periodic bcs for fermions .",
    "thus @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an integer for bosons , or a half - integer for fermions . for bosons ,",
    "we exclude the `` zero modes '' , i.e. @xmath12 . in the many - body basis , all basis states are selected to have the same total longitudinal momentum @xmath13 , where the sum is over the particles in a particular basis state . we then parameterize @xmath14 using a dimensionless variable @xmath15 such that @xmath16 . for a given particle @xmath17 ,",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 due to the positivity of longitudinal momenta on the light - front @xcite , fixing @xmath20 also serves as a fock space cutoff and makes the number of longitudinal modes finite @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath20 determines our `` resolution '' in the longitudinal direction , and thus our resolution on parton distribution functions .",
    "the longitudinal continuum limit corresponds to the limit @xmath21 . finally ,",
    "in the transverse direction , we employ a 2d harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis . on the light - front",
    ", the generating operator for the 2d ho basis can be expressed as @xmath22 here , and elsewhere , the boldface type is reserved for 2d transverse vectors .",
    "each value of @xmath23 in determines a unique complete and orthonormal basis . by defining the",
    "new coordinates @xcite @xmath24 we can write the generating operator as @xmath25 .",
    "\\label{eq : gen_op}\\ ] ] we see that @xmath26 generates a basis of energy scale @xmath27 . in this work ,",
    "we use eq . to define the 2d ho basis states .",
    "the momentum - space eigenfunctions of eq .",
    "are @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the generalized ( or `` associated '' ) laguerre polynomial .",
    "the basis is made finite by restricting the number of allowed oscillator quanta in each many - body basis state according to @xmath32 the transverse continuum limit corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we use an `` m - scheme '' basis .",
    "that is , our many body states have well defined values of the total angular momentum projection @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fermion spin , but they do not have a well - defined total angular momentum @xmath36 .    the choice of the 2d ho basis for blfq was made with the hadrons in mind . the ho",
    "potential is a confining potential , and therefore its wavefunctions should form an ideal basis for systems subject to qcd confinement .",
    "however , it is well known that the ho basis is not ideal for the coulomb problem , due to the mismatch of the asymptotic behaviors of the wavefunctions ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the ho wavefunctions have gaussian tails , while the hydrogen wavefunctions have a slower exponential decay .",
    "we therefore expect slow convergence in the positronium problem .      in blfq",
    ", we construct our many - body basis in single - particle coordinates .",
    "the rationale for doing this is its straightforward generalization to a basis of many particles . in principle ,",
    "relative ( jacobi ) coordinates could be used , but this process rapidly becomes intractable as the particle number is increased , due to the need for proper symmetrization of the basis states .",
    "of course , for the two - particle positronium system jacobi coordinates would be ideal .",
    "however , viewing the positronium problem only as a test case for our larger framework , here we nonetheless choose to work in single - particle coordinates .",
    "since our basis is constructed in single - particle coordinates , the center - of - mass ( cm ) motion of the system is contained in our solutions .",
    "the use of the ho basis combined with the @xmath37 truncation is a great advantage here since it allows for the exact factorization of the wavefunction into `` intrinsic '' and `` cm '' components , even within a truncated basis .",
    "the cm motion can then be removed from the low - lying spectrum by introducing a lagrange multiplier ( also known as the lawson term ) to the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the extra term essentially makes cm excitations very costly energetically therefore removing spurious cm excitations from the low - lying spectrum .",
    "when the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of the coordinates exact cm factorization is achieved for all eigenstates , even in a basis with arbitrary numbers of sectors , which is the reason for the introduction of these coordinates @xcite .",
    "the cm motion is then governed by @xmath38 the cm motion can be removed from the low - lying spectrum by adding a lagrange multiplier proportional to @xmath39 to the hamiltonian to get @xmath40 where @xmath41 . in practice , one selects @xmath42 to be large enough that @xmath43 is well above the excitation spectrum of interest .",
    "demonstrations of the exact cm factorization within blfq are given in refs .",
    "we truncate the fock space to include only @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "we wish to formulate an effective potential acting only in the @xmath7 space that includes the effects generated by the @xmath8 space . in the formalism of effective potentials , we consider the @xmath44 space to be the @xmath7 space and @xmath45 space to be the @xmath8 space .",
    "let @xmath46 be the operator that projects onto the @xmath44 space , and @xmath47 be the operator that projects onto the @xmath45 space .",
    "in addition to the effective interaction , the complete hamiltonian will also include those terms from @xmath48 which act directly in the two - particle space : @xmath49 .",
    "this contains two pieces .",
    "first , it contains the two - particle kinetic energy .",
    "secondly , it contains the light - front instantaneous photon exchange interaction .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath50 where states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are states in @xmath44 space ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the basis states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are eigenstates of the free hamiltonian ( i.e. @xmath53 ) with eigenvalue @xmath54 where the sum runs over particles ( of mass @xmath55 ) in the state @xmath51 .",
    "we choose the bloch form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian @xcite is given by : @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{eq : bloch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath57 is the light - cone hamiltonian introduced above .",
    "states @xmath51 and @xmath52 are states in @xmath44 space ( @xmath7 ) , while state @xmath58 is in the @xmath45 space ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we have written eq . in the notation traditionally used for effective potentials in non - relativistic quantum mechanics calculations .",
    "one must remember , though , that both the `` hamiltonian '' @xmath59 and the `` unperturbed energy '' @xmath60 have energy squared units in our formalism . note that if @xmath61 this reduces to the usual formula from second - order energy shift in perturbation theory .",
    "the derivation of , based on a perturbative expansion of the okubo - lee - suzuki effective hamiltonian @xcite , is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since we are interested in primarily the effects of repeated photon exchange , we will only include those combinations of terms in @xmath62 and @xmath63 which generate the photon exchange .",
    "we neglect the combinations which result in the photon being emitted and absorbed by the same fermion .",
    "that is , we do not incorporate the fermion self - energy .",
    "in addition , we work with unit - normalized eigenstates and a fixed value of the coupling constant .",
    "details are presented in the appendix .      the instantaneous photon exchange interaction @xmath64 contains a singularity of the form @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the incoming ( outgoing ) fermion ( see eq . ) . in light - front @xmath68-matrix perturbation theory , the amplitude for electron - positron scattering via a dynamical photon contains a term identical to the instantaneous photon exchange interaction , but with opposite sign .",
    "thus the instantaneous interaction is cancelled _ in its entirety _ , leaving behind the familiar equal - time feynman amplitude @xcite . from this perspective , the instantaneous photon exchange interaction exists only to cancel this singularity in the light - front electron - positron scattering amplitude .",

    "@xcite state that the origin of the instability can be traced to a particular term in the effective interaction ( or one - photon exchange kernel ) which tends to a non - zero constant , in momentum space , at asymptotically large momentum transfer , corresponding to a dirac delta potential in coordinate space .",
    "since the 2d dirac delta potential well has no bound states of finite binding energy @xcite , this leads to a divergence .",
    "the same divergent term is indeed present in our effective interaction .",
    "numerically , we find that the ground state energy is unstable with increasing @xmath37 , but stable with respect to @xmath20 for a fixed @xmath37 . the divergence can be removed by introducing a counterterm .",
    "@xcite argues that such a counterterm can be understood as accounting for the effects of the @xmath87 fock sector .",

    "we will refer to the resulting interaction as the `` regulated '' effective interaction .",

    "in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath92 and @xmath93 states of positronium scales as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the fine structure constant . at physical coupling , the expected hyperfine splitting and even the binding energy are then uncomfortably small relative to the precision of our numerical integrals .",
    "since we would like to use the hyperfine splitting to test our blfq results , we use a large coupling of @xmath0 to exaggerate both the binding energy and the hyperfine splitting .",
    "we then compare our results not to experiment , but to the predictions of non - relativistic quantum mechanics at this unphysical value of @xmath95 .",

    "scalapack software @xcite was used for the diagonalization . in this particular implementation of blfq ,",
    "the resulting matrix is quite dense .",
    "however , in future applications involving multiple fock sectors , the matrix will be extremely sparse .",

    "the total angular momentum operator is dynamical .",
    "in addition , manifest rotational invariance is lost in our calculation due to fock sector truncation , as well as the different discretizations in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",

    "<S> we present the first application of the recently developed basis light - front quantization ( blfq ) method to self - bound systems in quantum field theory , using the positronium system as a test case . within the blfq framework </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a two - body effective interaction , operating only in the lowest fock sector , that implements photon exchange , neglecting fermion self - energy effects . </S>",
    "<S> we then solve for the mass spectrum of this interaction at the unphysical coupling @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectrum is in good agreement with the expected bohr spectrum of non - relativistic quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> we examine in detail the dependence of the results on the regulators of the theory . </S>"
