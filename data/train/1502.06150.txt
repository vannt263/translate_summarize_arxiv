    "the collaboration has recently confirmed with high precision the cr positron fraction anomaly previously observed by pamela @xcite .",
    "the data show a rise of the fraction up at energies @xmath210  300gev , followed by a possible plateau at higher energies @xcite , which can not be described by conventional models of @xmath4 production by collisions of cr hadrons with the interstellar matter ( ism ) . in these models , the primary crs ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath5 , ,",
    ", , or ) are accelerated by supernova remnants ( snrs ) via diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanisms up to @xmath2pev energies to power - law spectra @xmath6 . their subsequent propagation is described by means of an energy - dependent confinement time @xmath7 ( or diffusion coefficient @xmath8 ) , and their collisions with the ism give rise to _ secondary _ crs such as , , , @xmath4 , or @xmath9 @xcite . at @xmath10gev ,",
    "this picture predicts power - law spectra for primary nuclei , @xmath11 , and decreasing secondary - to - primary ratios , _",
    "e.g. _ , the boron - to - carbon : @xmath12 , where @xmath130.30.7 , @xmath142.02.4 , and @xmath152.7 .",
    "the high - energy spectrum of cr leptons is further steepened by radiative losses , with characteristic time - scale @xmath16 .",
    "given all the positrons are from secondary origin , the positron fraction is expected to decrease similarly to other secondary - to - primary ratios , in remarkable contrast with the observations .",
    "explanations of the rise may include either dark - matter particles annihilation or decay , or nearby astrophysical sources @xcite . among the second class",
    ", it has been proposed that high energy positrons may be produced through hadronic interactions of cr protons undergoing dsa inside _ old _ snrs @xcite .",
    "yet , if secondary positrons are produced and accelerated by this mechanism , other secondary species ( such as nuclei or @xmath9 ) will also be produced from cr nuclei interacting with the gas .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this mechanism leads to an increase of the ratio at @xmath17100gev per nucleon .",
    "however the current ratio data decrease with energy , indicating that the _ old _ snr scenario ( hereafter osnr ) should be ruled out @xcite .    on the other hand , the spectra of primary cr elements",
    "have been measured up to @xmath2pev energies and beyond .",
    "recent data on cr protons and nuclei revealed a remarkable spectral hardening at @xmath2tev energies which stimulated great interest @xcite . according to the pamela data on and @xcite ,",
    "the change of slope is located at @xmath18230gv of rigidity ( _ i.e. _ , momentum - to - charge ratio ) with a very sharp transition , which is not seen by other experiments .",
    "while the sharpness of such breaks is under debate , the cr spectral hardening at @xmath191tev per nucleon is established by several experiments such as cream and atic @xcite .",
    "the proposed explanations invoke acceleration mechanisms @xcite , diffusion effects @xcite , or the superposition of local and distant sources @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we argue that the osnr scenario is incomplete in order to account for the observations of cr hadron spectra . whether the osnr represents a single source or a population of sources with the characteristics required for producing secondary @xmath3 ( _ i.e. _ , low shock speed and damped magnetic fields ) , it can not provide the flux of cr hadrons observed in the @xmath2tev  pev energy region , so that an additional high - energy component of cr accelerators is needed .",
    "we propose a two - component snr scenario where the high - energy part of the cr flux is provided by a galactic ensemble of snrs , hereafter gsnr , that are on average younger and more efficient when accelerating primary hadrons at high energies ( but are unable to accelerate secondaries ) .",
    "a key consideration is that the local flux of light cr nuclei depends on the large - scale structure of the galaxy , reflecting the contribution of a large population of snrs and their histories @xcite . for @xmath1910gev , their escape rate , @xmath20 ,",
    "is generally larger than their spallation rate in the ism @xmath21 so that their propagation is limited only by the size of the diffusion region . in contrast , light leptons are subjected to radiative cooling , due to synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering , which limits significantly the range that they can travel before reaching the solar system @xcite .",
    "their characteristic distance is approximately @xmath22 , confined to @xmath21kpc at energy above @xmath2100gev ( depending on the propagation parameters ) , which would legitimate the osnr approach .",
    "thus , while the observed @xmath3 can be largely produced by only one or few nearby sources , the total spectrum of cr protons and nuclei may well result as the sum two snr components : the nearby osnr component , which would dominate the flux below @xmath2100gev , and the gsnr ensemble , which would provide the high - energy flux up to the knee . as we will show , a two - component model gives a good description of the primary cr spectral hardening and it has an impact on the spectral shape of the ratio , which is now determined as the superposition of several contributions .",
    "the spectrum of crs accelerated in snrs is computed analytically using the linear dsa theory and including the secondary production terms due to hadronic interactions .",
    "we follow our calculation scheme in @xcite , which has been proven to be equivalent to that of @xcite . in the shock rest - frame ( @xmath23 ) , the upstream plasma flows in from @xmath24 with speed @xmath25 ( density @xmath26 ) and the downstream plasma flows out to @xmath27 with speed @xmath28 ( density @xmath29 ) .",
    "the compression ratio is @xmath30 . for a nucleus with charge @xmath31 and mass number @xmath32 ,",
    "the dsa equation reads : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the phase space density , @xmath35 is the diffusion coefficient near the snr shock , @xmath36 is the fluid velocity and @xmath37 is the total destruction rate for fragmentation with the interaction cross - section @xmath38 . the ambient density @xmath39 is assumed to be composed by 90% and 10% , similarly to the average ism , in both sides of the shock .",
    "the source term is represented by @xmath40 . for primary nuclei @xmath41 , _ i.e. _ ,",
    "the ambient particle injection occurs immediately upstream the shock at momentum @xmath42 , where @xmath43gv for all species .",
    "the @xmath44-constants are abundance factors , determined from the data .",
    "the source term for secondary fragments produced by spallation of heavier ( @xmath45labeled ) nuclei is of the type @xmath46 , where the partial rates of fragmentation are @xmath47 . using the subscript @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) to indicate the quantities in the upstream ( downstream ) region , the downstream solution of each nucleus",

    "the first term of eq.[eq::fullsolutionatshockfront ] gives the acceleration spectrum of primary particles at the shock , of the form @xmath58 .",
    "the second term describes the production and acceleration of cr fragments and it is coupled with the equations of heavier nuclei .",
    "the amount of secondary nuclei production depends on the snr properties via @xmath59 .",
    "their spectrum is of the form @xmath60 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath61 times harder than the primary source spectrum . for having an efficient acceleration of all particles",
    ", the condition @xmath62 must be fulfilled in the whole momentum ( or rigidity ) range considered @xcite . for bohm - type diffusion ( @xmath63 ) , this condition can be also expressed as @xmath64 . at @xmath65",
    "one has @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ , destructive interactions dominate over acceleration . in case of no interactions ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) the usual dsa solution @xmath69 is recovered for primary nuclei , while the secondary cr production vanishes . the total cr flux produced by the snr",
    "is obtained by integration in its volume : @xmath70 the exponential cut - off @xmath71 is used to explicitly account for the maximum momentum attained by the snr , due to the finite time of the dsa process @xmath72 , and it is assumed to occur at the same rigidity for all crs in the accelerator : @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 can be roughly estimated from equating @xmath57 with @xmath75 , which gives @xmath76 , though it is usually left as free parameter determined from the data @xcite .",
    "we stress that the steady - state description given here is an effective simplification of a more complex physical problem where the shock properties evolve with time .    for the galactic propagation",
    ", we use an analytical approach of cr diffusion and nuclear interactions , where the effects of energy changes are disregarded @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is modeled as a disc of half - thickness @xmath77 containing the ism gas ( number density @xmath78 ) and the cr sources .",
    "the disc is surrounded by a cylindric diffusive halo of half - thickness @xmath79 and zero matter density .",
    "for each cr nucleus , the transport equation reads : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is its number density as function of the @xmath82-coordinate , @xmath83 is the galactic diffusion coefficient and @xmath84 is the destruction rate in the ism at velocity @xmath85 and cross section @xmath38 .",
    "the source term @xmath86 includes the snr contributions , @xmath87 , and term for secondary production in the ism from spallation of heavier ( @xmath45 ) nuclei : @xmath88 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is taken as @xmath89 , spatially homogeneous , where @xmath90 expresses its normalization at @xmath914gv .",
    "we solve eq.[eq::transport1d ] for all nuclei ( from to ) after assuming stationarity ( @xmath92 ) , boundary conditions ( @xmath93 ) , and continuity condition across the disc .",
    "the differential fluxes at earth are given by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , evaluated at @xmath96 , is of the type @xmath97 .",
    "the quantities @xmath98 , @xmath83 , @xmath86 and @xmath99 depend on energy or rigidity too . to account for the solar modulation",
    ", we employ the _ force - field _",
    "approximation @xcite using the parameter @xmath100mv for a medium - level modulation strength .",
    "there are many parameters that determine the osnr source spectra .",
    "we follow the benchmark model of @xcite , that provides good fits to the leptonic data , assuming that the bulk of the @xmath3 flux is produced by this type of osnrs .",
    ". source and transport parameter sets . [ tab::parameters ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     all relevant parameters are listed in tab.[tab::parameters ] . in particular",
    "we adopt @xmath1011@xmath102 g , @xmath1031tv , @xmath10416 , and @xmath1055@xmath10610@xmath107cms@xmath108 , where @xmath109 parametrizes the deviation of @xmath35 from the bohm value due to magnetic damping .",
    "these values are typical for snrs at their late evolutionary stages .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered also scenarios with higher values of @xmath74 , fixed at 3 tv and 10 tv , which can in principle discriminated with @xmath4 data at higher energy . in fig.[fig::ccpositronflux ] we compare these predictions with the new high - energy data released by @xcite .",
    "the data suggest that models with high @xmath74 ( @xmath210tv or higher ) are disfavored .",
    "we also note that the value @xmath74=1tv is consistent with the naive estimate made from equating @xmath57 with @xmath75 . at this point",
    "it is clear that a pure osnr scenario , which describes well the @xmath2gv - tv observations , can not account for the cr hadronic flux observed at @xmath2tv - pv rigidities .",
    "this is also the rigidity region where the spectra are found to be harder .",
    "this consideration motivated us to introduce a second component for the cr hadron spectra at high energies , _",
    "i.e. _ , the gsnr component , representing the large - scale population of distant snrs . typical parameters for gsnrs with strong shock and amplified magnetic fields are @xmath11010@xmath111cms@xmath108 , @xmath112100@xmath102 g , and @xmath1135pv .",
    "it is easy to see that , from these values , gsnrs are unable to produce and accelerate secondary @xmath3 or li - be - b .",
    "furthermore , the resulting cr spectra are totally insensitive to their exact values ( and to the type of diffusion ) so that the only relevant gsnr parameters are the source spectral indices . for both components , osnr and gsnr , the slope @xmath114 and theirnor normalization are chosen to match the data on primary spectra after propagation .",
    "the source parameter @xmath114 is degenerated with the transport parameter @xmath115 , but the latter can been tested against the ratio . as in @xcite and",
    "related works , for @xmath116 we use a source spectral index steeper by 0.1 compared to that of heavier nuclei .",
    "this is a known issue , possibly ascribed to an @xmath117dependent injection efficiency in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "the relative source abundances are those adopted from previous studies @xcite and we use the same values for the two snr components .",
    "the contributions of the two components , determined from the data , are taken as 85% for the osnr and 15% for the gsnr flux at 1gev /",
    "n , for all elements .",
    "leptonic spectra from gsnr are expected not to contribute significantly to the high - energy flux , which is the case if these sources are placed at distances @xmath118kpc @xcite .",
    "the data at @xmath17tev energies require the gsnr spectra to be harder than those from the osnr : we adopt @xmath1194.1 and @xmath1204.0 .",
    "this is in fact encouraging , because the basic dsa predictions , supported by @xmath121ray observations of young snrs , favor @xmath1224.0  4.2 @xcite . with this setup , in fig.[fig::cchadronspectra ]",
    "we plot the model predictions for and fluxes as function of kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "the two components of the flux are shown , _",
    "i.e. _ , split as @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the data are well described by the model , which interprets the tev spectral hardening in terms of a smooth transition between the osnr and the gsnr component , but the fine structures of the pamela data can not be recovered .",
    "these sharp breaks seem also to be in contrast with the preliminary results of .",
    "we eagerly await the final results on and spectra at high energy , that will hopefully clarify how and where the spectral transition take places .",
    "we now come to the ratio .",
    "figure[fig::ccnucleispectra ] shows the and fluxes ( top ) and the ratio ( bottom ) compared with recent data , including the new data from pamela @xcite .",
    "the carbon flux , mostly primary , is also of the type @xmath125",
    ". it also experience a spectral hardening that is well reproduced by the model .",
    "the spectrum , entirely secondary , can be ideally split into @xmath126 , where the first component is the one produced inside the osnr , and the second arises in the ism via collisions of heavier nuclei such as , , or .",
    "thus , the ism component @xmath127 can be split again into @xmath128 ( produced by collisions of osnr - emitted nuclei ) and @xmath129 ( by gsnr - emitted nuclei ) . in previous osnr ",
    "related works such as @xcite , the ratio is always meant as @xmath130 .",
    "remarkably , while the ratio @xmath130 starts rising at @xmath131100gev per nucleon ( as expected by a pure osnr scenario ) , the ratio of the two - component model @xmath132 decreases with energy in good agreement with the data .",
    "the trend of our ratio is similar to the one from conventional propagation models ( long - dashed line ) where only gnrs component is considered .",
    "this effect can be understood from the top panel of the figure : at @xmath2100gev / nucleon , when the onsr component of would become relevant enough to provide a signature ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath133 ) , the total fluxes of and are both dominated by the gsnr components , @xmath129 and @xmath134 respectively .",
    "thus , in our two - component scenario , the ratio does not constrain secondary production in snr , as the presence of the gsrn component breaks the connection between the positron fraction and the secondary - to - primary nuclear ratios .",
    "we have tested the calculation using different values of @xmath74 . but",
    "due to a degeneration with the osnr parameter @xmath114 , the parameter @xmath74 can not be constrained much within the precision of the data .",
    "our results for the ratio seem to be quite robust : once accounting for the gsnr component , it decreases with energy as @xmath12 ( giving only little wiggles around the energy @xmath135 , see fig.[fig::ccnucleispectra ] ) . for @xmath1131tv or less ,",
    "the spectra of and experience deviations from the power - law behavior below the tev region that should be measurable by .",
    "our work is motivated by two outstanding problems in cr physics : the origin of the rise in the positron fraction at @xmath1910gev , and the nature of the @xmath2tev spectral hardening in cr hadrons .",
    "we revisited the onsr scenario , proposed for the positron fraction anomaly , in order to account for the high - energy observations of cr hadron and nuclei . in osnr models , secondary particles such as positrons and light - nuclei",
    "are produced and accelerated inside snrs via hadronic interactions . in order to be able to match the @xmath3 data ,",
    "these old - snrs must have particular properties in terms of environmental parameters ( such as strongly damped magnetization , or relatively high gas density ) and predicts features in the b / c ratio that are not observed . in this letter",
    ", we have argued that the osnr scenario is incomplete for explaining the flux of cr hadrons at @xmath2tev  pev energies .",
    "the osnr can account for the leptonic flux and for the gev - tev production of cr hadrons , but the flux at higher energies has to be provided by a population of distant and young sources that are able to efficiently accelerate crs up to the knee .",
    "these sources are unable to produce secondary crs ( due to magnetic field amplification ) and they do not contribute significantly to the high - energy leptonic flux ( due to the large distance ) . within this picture the spectral hardening of cr hadrons is interpreted as a signature of the transition between the local osnr component and the galactic ensemble .",
    "the spectra of all primary nuclei are predicted to harden .",
    "taking into account the contribution of the two populations , we found that the predicted ratio show no prominent signatures : it decreases with energy in accordance with the existing data . in conclusion , this generalized scenario may explains the absence of signatures in the ratio while accounting for the observed signatures in primary cr hadrons .",
    "a quantitative inspection will be done with a proper modeling of leptonic and hadronic spectra arising from a realistic time - space distribution of their sources .",
    "it will be crucial , for achieving this goal , to have precision data on cr protons and nuclei in the energy region where the spectral transition takes place ."
