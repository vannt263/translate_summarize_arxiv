    "magneto - electric ( me ) multiferroics are materials with long - range electric and magnetic order .",
    "@xcite understanding how multiple order parameters coexist and couple is interesting in and of itself .",
    "however , me multiferroics also have potential applications to magnetic storage , novel circuits , sensors , microwave and high - power applications .",
    "@xcite achieving strong me coupling between _ net _ magnetization and _ net _ electric polarization is particularly important for applications . to date however , multiferroics are rare , and those with significant me coupling even more so .",
    "transition magnetic oxides have been attracting the most attention in this field recently due to their relatively high magnetic ordering temperatures and tendency to form large electric polarizations .",
    "@xcite those with the strongest me coupling have complex spin textures that break spatial - inversion symmetry ( sis ) and alter the lattice so as to generate an electric polarization .",
    "@xcite the trouble is that many of these complex spin textures do nt produce any net magnetization .",
    "ca@xmath8mncoo@xmath1 @xcite was recently found to exhibit a net hysteretic magnetization below 14 k , coupled to a ferroelectric polarization that is suppressed in magnetic fields of 10 t. this compound forms chains of alternating mn@xmath3 @xmath2 and co@xmath4 @xmath9 ions , with the chains in turn arranged in magnetically frustrated triangles .",
    "magnetic exchange is mediated via oxygens that form edge - sharing octahedra around each ion .",
    "an @xmath5 magnetic structure along mn - co chains breaks spatial inversion symmetry and induces electric polarization .",
    "although an @xmath5 spin configuration is found in zero magnetic field , a net magnetization with hysteresis is observed in applied magnetic fields .",
    "here we present results on a new compound , lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 in which we also observe @xmath5 magnetic order along co - mn chains , that creates an electric polarization .",
    "we address the issue of how this antiferromagnetic structure can produce a net magnetization . although the magnetic field - coupled electric polarization of lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 is smaller than in ca@xmath8mncoo@xmath1 , partially due to its polycrystalline nature , the transition temperature for lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 is higher ( 35 k ) , and the magnetic field required to suppress electric polarization is lower ( 1.2 t ) , bringing us a step closer to useful temperatures and magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic structure is also simpler with no frustrated triangular arrangement of the co - mn chains ( see figures [ spins ] and [ structure ] ) , thus unraveling the physics is more straightforward . in lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 both co@xmath4 and mn@xmath3",
    "spins are @xmath2 instead of co@xmath4 @xmath9 and mn@xmath3 @xmath2 , and the oxygen octahedra are corner - sharing rather than edge - sharing .",
    "these suggests that the @xmath5 magnetic structure coupling to electric polarization can be a wide - spread mechanism for coupling of net magnetism and electric polarization and can be pushed in the direction of useful temperatures and magnetic fields for applications .",
    "we synthesized a polycrystalline sample of lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 by a nitrate decomposition method using lu@xmath0o@xmath8 ( aldrich , 99.9% ) , co(no@xmath8)@xmath06h@xmath0o ( aldrich , 98% ) , and mn(no@xmath8)@xmath05h@xmath0o ( aldrich , 98% ) as starting materials .",
    "we performed numerous syntheses to obtain a pure sample because there is frequently a small quantity of lu@xmath0o@xmath8 .",

    ", the ac susceptibility shows a small frequency - dependence indicative of slow spin dynamics .",
    "the onset of the frequency dependence arises at the same temperature below which a bifurcation between the zfc and fc @xmath59 curves occurs .",
    "though not shown here , the zfc magnetization relaxes in the direction of the fc magnetization with a time constant of a few hours .",
    "the observed slow spin dynamics are reminiscent of spin glass type behavior occurring below 35 k.    magnetization vs magnetic field @xmath63",
    "hysteresis curves are shown in figure [ mvsh]a , at 2 , 3 , and 4 k for magnetic fields up to 13 t. at 2 k , ferromagnetic - like hysteresis is observed , with a very sudden switching of the magnetization occurring at a coercive magnetic field of 1.21 t. a plateau - like feature is seen between 1.2 and 3 t , as indicated with arrows .",
    "the switching behavior of the magnetization broadens in @xmath32 for the data at 3 and 4 k and the plateau disappears .",
    "the magnetization does not fully saturate by 13 t ; a moment 4.5 @xmath55 is achieved at 2 k and 13 t. hysteresis curves to higher magnetic fields were measured in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 t at the nhmfl , as shown in figure [ mvsh]b .",
    "this pulsed magnetic field data shows that the expected full moment of @xmath64/formula unit is achieved by 60 t and 0.5 k. the identical coercive magnetic field of 1.21 t is obtained , although on the fast time scales of these pulsed magnetic field data , the reversal of the magnetization appears broader .",
    "the data shown is a combined plot of measurements from pulses with peak magnetic fields of 5 , 15 , and 60 t. since the measured quantity in the extraction coil magnetometer is d@xmath65/d@xmath35 , the sudden magnetization reversal at 1.21 t results in a very large d@xmath65/d@xmath35 signal that saturates the data acquisition system for the 60 t pulse .",
    "however , it is not useful to reduce the amplification or use a smaller sample in the 60 t pulse because a high sensitivity is needed to precisely measure the data near the 60 t peak magnetic field , where d@xmath32/d@xmath35 is smaller and @xmath63 is also saturating",
    ". instead , we measured the magnetization reversal with smaller d@xmath32/d@xmath35 pulses by reducing the peak magnetic field to 5 and 15 t. in figure [ mvsh]b , data for pulses with 5 , 15 , and 60 t peak magnetic fields are shown superimposed , with the data from the 60 t pulse only shown between 5 and 60 t.    our semiconducting , polycrystalline samples of lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 are slightly conductive at room temperature , making electric polarization and dielectric constant measurements difficult . however , with decreasing temperature the conductance decreases , reaching less than 0.1 ps below 100 k as measured with an anderleen - hagerlin capacitance bridge .",
    "the change in electric polarization with magnetic field @xmath66 was measured in pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 t after electrically poling the sample by first cooling the sample from 70 to 4 k in an electric field and then removing the electric field and shorting the two sides of the sample before measuring .",
    "poling electric fields of 2 mv / m were used for the data shown , and @xmath66 was found to be linear for poling electric fields between 0 and 2.5 mv / m .",
    "the measured signal , d@xmath67/d@xmath35 , and the integrated @xmath66 are shown in figure [ pvsh]a , b .",
    "the measured @xmath68 is constant for magnetic fields between 0 and 1.6 t ( 2.6 t below 1.5 k ) , then drops suddenly and continues to drop at a slow and continuous rate up to 60 t ( see inset ) . on the downsweep of the magnetic field and on subsequent @xmath66 measurements",
    "we observe almost no @xmath32-dependence ( the second shot after poling shows 2% of the original @xmath66 , and subsequent shots show no resolvable @xmath66 ) .",
    "a significant @xmath66 can only be observed again after re - poling .",
    "we interpret this as a magnetic field - induced _ suppression _ of most of the electric polarization .",
    "@xmath66 was measured for both @xmath33 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath34 and the same results were found in these polycrystalline samples .",
    "data for both magnetic field directions at 4 k and up to 60 t are shown in the inset to figure [ pvsh]a .",
    "all the rest of the data shown was measured with @xmath69 .",
    "the inset to figure [ pvsh]b shows the temperature dependence of @xmath68 between @xmath70 and 15 t. the onset of @xmath66 occurs around 30 k.    the dielectric constant as a function of temperature and magnetic field is shown in figure [ dielectric]a for frequencies of 10 khz and 1 mhz .",
    "it exhibits a broad peak near 35 k , which is the same temperature below which splitting between the zfc and fc magnetization curves arises , frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility occurs , and @xmath66 becomes nonzero .",
    "the peak in the dielectric constant is completely suppressed in an applied magnetic field of 14 t.",
    "we interpret our results as follows : below 43 k , long - range magnetic order sets in , observed as a significant kink in the magnetization and a peak in the specific heat .",
    "below 35 k , an electric polarization can be induced by poling in an electric field , and glassy magnetic dynamics and a hysteretic magnetization also occur .",
    "consistent with this picture , a peak in the dielectric constant appears near 35 k ( see figure [ dielectric ] ) .",
    "neutron diffraction data at 4 k and @xmath70 identify a ferroelectric @xmath5 configuration of spins along chains of alternating @xmath2 mn@xmath3 and @xmath2 co@xmath4 spins in the c - axis ( see figure [ spins ] ) .",
    "this spin configuration is likely the result of frustration between nearest - neighbor and next - nearest neighbor magnetic exchange interactions with opposite sign , similar to ca@xmath8mncoo@xmath1 @xcite .    in the following we use the term `` domain boundary '' to refer to the boundary between @xmath6 and @xmath7 spins along the c - axis .",
    "since there are two types of ions ( co@xmath4 and mn@xmath3 ) , there are also two types of domain walls : the ones that are centered on a co@xmath4-mn@xmath3 bond and the ones centered on a mn@xmath3-co@xmath4 bond . these different domain walls carry opposite electric polarizations because they break the local spatial inversion symmetry in opposite ways . in other words ,",
    "the ferromagnetic domains walls carry an internal degree of freedom of electric polarization due to the small structural distortions caused by the magnetostriction effects induced by the wall .",
    "this leads to the coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity .",
    "in particular , a perfect @xmath5 phase can be thought of as a condensation of domain walls whose electric polarizations are all aligned .",
    "if the sample is cooled through its transition in an electric field , it stores a net electric polarization by inducing more domains walls with one polarization than with the opposite .",
    "this electric polarization is mostly destroyed in applied magnetic fields above 1.5 t , with an additional small electric polarization persisting to 60 t. once destroyed , the sample must be re - poled ( cooled again through @xmath43 in an electric field ) to regenerate the maximum electric polarization .",
    "the dielectric constant measurements also confirm the strongly magnetic field - dependent nature of the electric polarization , with the peak near 35 k completely suppressed in applied magnetic fields of 14 t.    while the @xmath5 spin configuration does not produce a net magnetization , we suggest that in applied magnetic fields the domain walls slide apart due to the close proximity to a ferromagnetic instability . as the domain walls become less dense ,",
    "the electric polarization is also suppressed .",
    "commensurate configurations such as @xmath71 might lock in , resulting in plateaus in the magnetization .",
    "one plateau is observed near 1/3 saturation magnetization at 2 k. magnetization data on single crystals as well as neutron diffraction data in magnetic fields are needed to test this scenario .",
    "we note that the condensation of domain walls in the @xmath5 leads to infinitely small domain walls and the domains themselves are as small as 7 angstroms ( c - axis lattice parameter ) . by contrast , conventional domain walls induced by dipole - dipole interaction in ferromagnets and multiferroics can be tens to hundreds of nm wide with domains that can be up to hundreds of mm wide . in lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 , the condensation of domain walls that leads to the @xmath5 configuration likely results from frustration between nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "consequently , in comparison to conventional ferromagnets , the domain walls in lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 are far smaller and also more mobile due to the proximity to a ferromagnetic instability .",
    "this increased mobility may account for the spin glass - like frequency - dependence of the ac susceptibility below 35 k. an alternate explanation for the net hysteretic magnetization in magnetic fields is that spins tilt out of the c - axis .",
    "however this is less likely to fully explain the hysteresis and slow relaxation of the magnetization .",
    "although the coercive magnetic field for switching the magnetization is 1.21 t and most of the electric polarization is destroyed at 1.6 t , saturation magnetization is not reached until @xmath72 t , and the electric polarization continues to show a small net contribution up to this magnetic field .",
    "a likely explanation is that the 9% mn - co site interchange determined from the neutron scattering data results in some mn - mn and co - co nearest neighbor pairs . in related compounds ,",
    "co - co and mn - mn nearest neighbor superexchange interactions are antiferromagnetic , thus they would locally pin the domain boundaries between `` up '' and `` down '' regions of spins .    finally we should mention that la@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 is another close relative of lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 that has been studied since the 1950s .",
    "in this material , confusion reigned for a long time @xcite due to the presence of multiple phases with different mn and co valences , as well as mn - co site interchange .",
    "these problems resulted in different magnetic ordering temperatures , saturated moments , and different degrees of thermoelectric power .",
    "these structural problems mostly ensued when the oxygen deficiency @xmath38 was greater than 0.02 , allowing co@xmath73 and mn@xmath73 to form , as well as from mn - co site interchange . in the case of our lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1",
    ", we see only one magnetic phase and iodometric titrations indicate that @xmath74 .",
    "we do however see co - mn site interchange of about 9% , which could create local antiferromagnetic interactions as discussed .",
    "in summary , lu@xmath0mncoo@xmath1 is a new member of the multiferroic oxides , showing magnetic order below 43 k , and ferroelectricity below 35 k that is strongly coupled to a net magnetism .",
    "an @xmath5 arrangement of the spins in zero magnetic field breaks spatial inversion symmetry and induces electric polarization .",
    "we suggest that the domain walls between @xmath6 and @xmath7 regions slide in an applied magnetic field due to close proximity to a ferromagnetic instability , resulting in net ferromagnetic - like magnetization with a coercive field of 1.21 t that switches between states of approximately 1/3 saturation magnetization .",
    "a magnetization of @xmath606 @xmath55/formula unit is eventually reached by 60 t consistent with the @xmath2 spin for both co@xmath4 and mn@xmath3 ions .",
