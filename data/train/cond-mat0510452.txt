    "vibronic coupling may lead to rotations , conformational changes , atomic rearrangements , and chemical reactions induced by the electronic current  @xcite .",
    "it is directly relevant to the junction heating problem and can manifest itself in polaron - type localization effects and inelastic signals in current - voltage spectra . @xcite while weak inelastic signatures are observed in measurements of conductance with strong electronic coupling between the molecule and leads , stronger vibronic peaks with pronounced phonon sidebands ( we use the term phonon to describe any vibrational excitation ) may be observed when this coupling is weak .",
    "a full franck - condon envelope has been observed with weak molecule - electrode interactions at both termini  @xcite .",
    "studies of electron - phonon interaction have a long history  @xcite , however new points for consideration arise in biased current carrying junctions .",
    "the interpretation of electronic transport in molecular junctions has until recently has been made largely in the context of multi - channel scattering problems  @xcite , which disregards the influence of the contact population ( manifestations of the pauli principle blocking of scattering channels , change of electronic structure , etc . ) on inelastic process .",
    "such approaches also disregard the influence of the electronic subsystem on the phonon dynamics .",
    "a systematic framework describing transport phenomena of many - particle systems which can take these effects into account can be developed based on the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) formulation@xcite .",
    "phonon - assisted electron transport in molecular systems can be classified by the relative time and energy scales of the processes involved .",
    "the electron lifetime in the junction should be compared to the relevant vibrational frequency@xcite , while the strength of the electron - phonon coupling should be judged relative to electronic matrix elements ( coupling to contacts and/or between isolated parts of the molecular system ) .",
    "it is useful to consider separately the limits of weak and strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the first corresponds to non - resonant phonon - assisted electron tunneling mostly encountered in experiments on inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets )  @xcite . with the development and advances in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) ,",
    "iets has proven invaluable as a tool for identifying and characterizing molecular species within the conduction region .",
    "the use of migdal - eliashberg theory@xcite is justified in this case , whereupon the lowest non - vanishing ( second ) order perturbation in electron - phonon coupling on the keldysh contour leads to the born approximation ( ba ) for electron dynamics .",
    "this approach using ba or its self - consistent ( in electron green function ) flavor was used in several theoretical studies  @xcite . in a recent publication  @xcite",
    "we used an advanced version of this scheme , self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for both electron and phonon green functions , to describe features ( peaks , dips , line shape , and line width ) of the iets signal , @xmath2 , as a function of the applied voltage @xmath3 .",
    "sometimes scba is used also in the resonant tunneling regime  @xcite .",
    "this usage is valid only if electron - phonon interaction is weak , so that no essential inelastic features ( e.g. polaron formation ) can be studied in this case .",
    "the other limit is realized in cases of resonant tunneling , which is characterized by longer electron lifetime in the junction ( though it still may be short relative to the characteristic phonon frequency ) and stronger effective electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the perturbative treatment breaks down in this case which may result in formation of a polaron in the junction .",
    "signatures of resonant tunneling driven by an intermediate molecular ion appear as peaks in the first derivative @xmath4 and may show phonon subbands  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical studies of this situation in tunneling junctions are available  @xcite .",
    "most of them  @xcite are based on scattering theory consideration , others  @xcite are based partially on the negf methodology .",
    "however these works disregard the fermi population in the leads as mentioned above .",
    "another approach , the non - equilibrium linked cluster expansion ( nlce ) , is based on generalization of the linked cluster expansion to nonequilibrium situations  @xcite .",
    "this approach takes the contact population into account , but appears to be unstable for diagrammatic expansion beyond the lowest order .",
    "note also that in all the cases mentioned above the phonon subsystem is assumed to remain in thermal equilibrium throughout the process .",
    "the rate equations approach often used in the literature for the case of weak coupling to the leads  @xcite is essentially a quasiclassical treatment , having an assumption that the tunneling rate is much smaller than decoherence rates on the molecular subsystem . while the approach is useful in describing e.g. @xmath5 center of mass motion as is done in ref .",
    ", the intramolecular vibrations we are interested in here may have a much longer lifetime , thus making the rate equations approach inappropriate .",
    "an attempt to generalize single particle approximation of refs .   was presented in ref .  , where an eom method was used .",
    "another interesting approach uses numerical renormalization group methodology to study inelastic effects in conductance in the linear response regime  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an approximate scheme for treating electronic transport in cases involving intermediate to strong electron - phonon coupling in tunnel junctions .",
    "we employ the keldysh contour based description , which treats both electron and phonon degrees of freedom in a self - consistent manner .",
    "this approach is close in spirit to nlce  @xcite in using a cumulant expansion ( when finding an approximate expression for phonon shift operators correlation function in terms of phonon green functions ) .",
    "however unlike nlce the proposed scheme is stable and self - consistent , i.e. the influence of tunneling current on the phonon subsystem is taken into account .",
    "it reduces to the scattering theory results in the limit where the molecular bridge energies are far above the fermi energy of the leads and provides a scheme for analyzing the effect of the electronic current on the energetics in the vibrational space in resonance tunneling situations ( the issue will be discussed elsewhere ) .",
    "derivation of equations is based on eom method , which makes our approach similar to ref .  .",
    "however we go beyond it in taking into account renormalization of phonon subsystem due to coupling to tunneling electron .",
    "thermal relaxation of the molecular phonons , not taken into account in  @xcite , is also introduced in our consideration .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and describe the approximations made .",

    "the electron on the resonant level ( electronic energy @xmath9 ) is linearly coupled to a single vibrational mode ( phonon ) with frequency @xmath10 , henceforth referred to as the `` primary phonon '' .",

    "we go a step further by dressing these terms in the spirit of standard diagrammatic technique  @xcite .",

    "is based on the migdal - eliashberg theory , which is known to break down in the case of intermediate to strong electron - phonon coupling  @xcite , this finding should be critically examined .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] confirm the conclusions of mitra  et  al .",
    "note also that the cause of the previous erroneous predictions is neglect or oversimplified description of hole transport  @xcite in @xcite .",
    "finally , in the case where the couplings to the two contacts are proportional to each other , @xmath131 , the current through the junction for resonant level model can be obtained as an integral over dos  @xcite , @xmath132\\ ] ] in the case of small source - drain voltage , where @xmath133 is a smooth function of @xmath134 , the current characteristics are determined by @xmath98 .",
    "we can therefore demonstrate the `` floating '' behavior of phonon sidebands in a contour plot of the dos vs. energy and electron level position ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "parameters of the calculation here are the same as in fig .",
    "figure  [ fig6]a shows the zero - order result , while figure  [ fig6]b presents a self - consistent calculation .",
    "one sees that the phonon sidebands disappear around the position of fermi level @xmath135  ev .",

    "[ fig5 ] . note that since the effect is present already in the zero - order situation ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]a ) , it can be studied analytically .",
    "we find , that for low temperatures ( @xmath136 ) one can not see phonon sidebands in the current - voltage characteristic while changing gate voltage unless @xmath137 ( see appendix  [ appe ] ) .",
    "within a non - equilibrium green function formalism on the keldysh contour , we have developed an approximate self - consistent procedure for treating a phonon - assisted resonant level model in the case of intermediate to strong electron - phonon interaction , where the strength of this interaction is determined relative to the bridge - contacts coupling .",
    "our scheme goes beyond earlier considerations of this problem by taking into account the mutual influence of the electron and phonon subsystems . in zero - order and in a single electron transport situation ( fermi energies in the leads far above or far below the bridge level so that the latter is full or empty , respectively ) it is similar to other approaches  @xcite .",
    "however in the case of a partially filled resonance level even the zero - order of the self - consistent scheme extends previous calculations ( at least in low temperature regime ) in treating correctly hole transport .",
    "our approach is also similar in zero - order to the nlce scheme proposed in  @xcite , since both use cumulant expansion on the contour .",
    "however while nlce appears to be problematic when going to the second cluster approximation , the present scheme is rather stable when higher order correlations are included by the self - consistent procedure .",
    "we have presented several numerical examples and compared results to those of earlier studies .",
    "the self - consistent calculation is found to yield drastically different results as compared to the zero - order theory in the case of strong electron - phonon interaction and in the region of a partially filled electronic level . in particular",
    ", it leads to shifts ( in position and height ) of peaks in the conductance vs. source - drain voltage plot and to phonon absorption signals even at low temperatures , that probably result from heating of the primary phonon by the electronic flux .",
    "the non - equilibrium electron dos and the electron distribution show a similar structure , with peaks associated with phonon emission and absorption .",
    "finally , we confirm the statement of ref .",
    "that current measured in a gate voltage experiment , when source - drain voltage is fixed at some small value , will not produce peaks in current vs. position of electron level plot , as was erroneously suggested in  @xcite . since the statement in  @xcite",
    "is based on application of the migdal - eliashberg theory , known to break down in the case of intermediate to strong electron - phonon interaction , our confirmation seems to be essential .",
    "together with previous work  @xcite , which deals with the weak electron - phonon interaction case in a self - consistent manner , this provides tools for describing both resonant ( intermediate to strong interaction ) and off - resonant ( weak interaction ) tunneling regimes in molecular junctions .",
    "straightforward generalization of the present scheme would involve retaining mixed terms in deriving the equation of motion for the phonon green function ( appendix  [ appc ] ) , thus abandoning the non - crossing approximation ( i.e. introducing vertex corrections ) .",
    "one could also go beyond second order in electron - phonon coupling in the cumulant expansion ( appendix  [ appb ] ) or in coupling to the contacts in eoms ( appendices  [ appc ] and [ appd ] ) .",
    "development of a scheme spanning the entire range of parameters in the nonequilibrium situation is a goal for future work .",
