    "* ) , and therefore exceed the predictions of our model .      in this section",
    "we summarize the main qualitative differences between this work and previous studies of the ohmic heating mechanism .",
    "the total dissipated power , given by the efficiency @xmath85 , depends on the speed of atmospheric flows . @xcite and @xcite assume fiducial speeds of @xmath253 , which result in @xmath254 .",
    "however , @xcite advocate for a discontinuous drop of order @xmath255 in the dissipated power over the wind zone edge , which is absent in the model of @xcite .    in this work",
    "we studied the decay of atmospheric winds with depth , by comparing the advective and radiative timescales .",
    "in contrast to previous studies @xcite our treatment is valid for optical depths above unity .",
    "we found that the winds decay as a power law with pressure , allowing us to replace the discontinuity of @xcite with a continuous drop , and to relate the wind zone depth @xmath129 ( which is an arbitrary parameter in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the atmospheric scale height .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we do not choose a constant fiducial wind speed , and therefore a constant efficiency , but rather calculate the wind speed by comparing the thermal forcing ( due to the day - night temperature difference ) to the coriolis force ( relevant for @xmath256 ) and to the magnetic drag ( relevant for @xmath242 ) .",
    "this analysis leads us to replace the constant @xmath85 with an efficiency which rises to a maximum of @xmath257 at @xmath78 , and then drops at higher equilibrium temperatures due to the reduction of wind speeds by the magnetic drag .",
    "our variable @xmath85 model is similar to @xcite , with two main differences : we consider the balance between the thermal forcing and the coriolis force instead of the nonlinear advective term @xmath258 ( our low rossby number approximation is more appropriate in this case , see section [ subsec : winds_currents ] ) , and we do not treat the planet s magnetic field as a free parameter , but rather couple it to the planet s rotation rate , and therefore to its equilibrium temperature . despite these differences , our model qualitatively reproduces the results of @xcite , as seen by comparing our equation to their figure 4 .",
    "another new ingredient in our work is the analytic translation of a given heat dissipation efficiency to an inflated planet radius .",
    "most previous studies calculate the ohmically heated planet evolution using stellar evolution codes , with the exception of @xcite , who numerically integrate a simplified model based on @xcite . in this work , however , we calculate the planet s evolution using a generalization of a simple analytic theory , derived in .",
    "this analytical approach provides a broader understanding of the scaling laws governing hot - jupiter inflation .",
    "one interesting example of an insight gained by our analytical model is the qualitative shape of the @xmath259 curve plotted in figure [ fig : power_law ] .",
    "specifically , how come the inflation increases with temperature , while the heating efficiency @xmath260 drops due to the magnetic drag at high temperatures , as explained above ?",
    "the answer is obtained by considering equation , which indicates that the inflation is determined by two competing factors .",
    "while the efficiency decreases , the increasing @xmath261 opacity pushes the radiative - convective boundary ( in the final equilibrium state ) to lower pressures ( since @xmath184 ) , raising the temperatures of the inner adiabat ( this effect is represented by the @xmath262 term in the equation ) .",
    "quantitatively , due to its high maximal efficiency @xmath263 , our model predicts somewhat more inflated planets in the range @xmath264 , compared with the constant @xmath265 model of @xcite , as seen by comparing our figure [ fig : power_law ] and their figure 5 .",
    "however , the differences between the two models are modest ( @xmath266 ) , due to the relatively weak dependence of the inflated radius on the efficiency @xmath267 , the sharp drop of the efficiency at @xmath242 , evident from equation , and the somewhat flatter heating profile of @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite , on the other hand , predicts higher inflations , due to the absence of a drop in their heating profile ( see figure [ fig : eps_eff ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , by comparing our figure [ fig : power_law ] to their figures 6 - 8 , we find that the differences are partially compensated by the lower efficiencies @xmath268 and the somewhat steeper heating profile of @xcite , and amount to @xmath269 for @xmath270 planets .",
    "in the previous sections we assumed that planets cool and contract from high temperatures ( and therefore large radii ) under the influence of both stellar irradiation and additional power deposition ( e.g. ohmic dissipation ) . however , another possible scenario ( due to migration on long timescales , for example ) involves dissipation mechanisms that come into play only once the planet has already cooled and contracted to a relatively small radius ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "* and references within ) .",
    "it is clear from the discussion in section [ sec : power_law ] that the final equilibrium temperature profile of the planet is given by figure [ fig : scheme_center ] , with central temperature @xmath271 , even if the planet had initially @xmath272 ( the general equilibrium profile , in case the energy deposition does not reach the center , is given in appendix [ sec : other_cases ] ) .",
    "however , although planets cool down ( and contract ) or heat up ( and expand ) to the same temperatures ( and radii ) , imposed by the stellar irradiation and the heat deposition , we show below that the timescales to reach equilibrium are different . in figure",
    "[ fig : reinflate ] we present a schematic plot of the reheating ( and therefore re - inflation ) of a planet from an initial central temperature @xmath18 ( assuming the planet has cooled for a few gyr in the absence of power deposition ) to a final equilibrium central temperature @xmath273 , imposed by the energy deposition . as",
    "seen in figure [ fig : reinflate ] , the planet heats up from the outside in .",
    "this result , which is also evident from numerical calculations by @xcite , is due to both the increase in heat capacity and final temperature with depth and the decrease in deposition with depth , so the heating rate is @xmath274 .",
    "this outside - in heating implies that models , which exploit the entire heat deposited in the convective region to heat up the planet , overestimate the reheating rate ( see , e.g. , the recent work by * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : reinflate ] ]    the time to heat the planet s center , which determines the re - inflation timescale is given by @xmath275 it is instructive to compare this timescale to the cooling timescale of initially hot planets to the same equilibrium central temperature . due to the decrease of the internal luminosity with central temperature ,",
    "the cooling timescale is also determined by the final equilibrium temperature @xmath271 , as seen by combining equations and @xmath276 where the last equality is due to the condition @xmath277 , which is fulfilled in the final cooling stage ( see section [ sec : power_law ] and figure [ fig : scheme_center ] ) . by combining equations and we find @xmath278 with the numerical value calculated using @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 .",
    "since the typical cooling time to a radius of @xmath282 is @xmath76 ( see , e.g. , figure [ fig : power_law ] ) , the long heating timescales of @xmath283 ( for @xmath284 , which matches inflation to @xmath282 ) imply that planets can only be mildly re - inflated with ohmic dissipation ( up to about @xmath285 ) , and that they do not reach their final equilibrium temperature ( see * ? ? ? * for similar results ) .",
    "in this work we analytically studied the effects of additional power sources on the radius of irradiated giant gas planets .",

    "* ) may reveal the nature of the additional heat deposition mechanism , if exists , and provide a step toward solving the observed radius anomalies .    for a quantitative example",
    ", we focused on the suggested ohmic dissipation mechanism , which stems from the interaction of atmospheric winds with the planet s magnetic field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "this mechanism can be described by a power law @xmath204 in the planet s interior , and a reduction of @xmath293 in the efficiency , due to the slimness of the wind zone .",
    "we therefore found that the threshold efficiency in this case is @xmath294 , in accordance with previous numerical studies .    assuming a constant efficiency of 3% , we estimated inflated radii which are similar to the numerical predictions of @xcite .",
    "however , we challenged the assumption of a constant efficiency , made in previous studies , and examined the correlation between the efficiency and the equilibrium temperature .",
    "we found that the efficiency rises with temperature , due to the increase in electrical conductivity , to a maximum of @xmath295 at @xmath78 , and then drops due to the magnetic drag ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "in addition , we argue that if these planets are indeed inflated by the ohmic mechanism then they have already reached their final equilibrium state ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , and that the energy deposition must have suspended their contraction , and could not have re - inflated them from a smaller radius , since re - inflation timescales are too long ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "nonetheless , some extremely inflated planets have radii which exceed the predictions of our model .",
