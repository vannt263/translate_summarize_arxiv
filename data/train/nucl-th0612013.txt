    "a promising approach to the nucleon electromagnetic ( em ) structure at low and moderate momentum transfers consists in employing constituent quark models ( cqms ) in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) .",
    "different forms of rqm , such as the instant , front , and point forms , have been used by various authors ( e.g. , in refs .",
    "realistic descriptions of the em nucleon form factors were specifically obtained with the goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) cqm .",
    "working within the point form , the electric and magnetic form factors of both the proton and the neutron were described in surprisingly good agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the electric radii and magnetic moments of all the octet and decuplet baryon ground states were reproduced as well  @xcite . by an analogous calculation",
    "also the axial nucleon form factors could be explained consistently  @xcite . until now , it remains as a puzzle why the direct quark - model predictions in point form fall so close to experiment in all aspects of the electroweak nucleon structure , especially since simplified spectator - model current operators have been employed and no additional parametrizations have been introduced .",
    "it is noteworthy that the point - form results are also very similar to the parameter - free predictions of the instanton - induced ( ii ) cqm of the bonn group that were calculated in a completely different approach along the bethe - salpeter formalism  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the reproduction of the baryon em properties gave impulse to studies of strong decays of baryon resonances along the same formalisms .",
    "however , the corresponding decay widths are not described equally well  @xcite .    in order to clarify the situation we undertook a closer inspection of the point - form spectator model ( pfsm ) in ref .",
    "we demonstrated along the strong decay widths that some significant effects may be caused by ambiguities connected to the fact that a unique spectator - model construction can not be obtained by imposing poincar invariance alone .",
    "it was already observed before that further constraints should be included  @xcite .",
    "this property is inherent to any form of rqm and in this paper we specifically discuss the effects of such ambiguities in the instant form spectator model ( ifsm ) and the pfsm .",
    "we address the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors at momentum transfers up to @xmath0 gev@xmath1 .",
    "first we introduce the construction of instant - form and point - form spectator - model currents and characterize their particular properties .",
    "we then derive their nonrelativistic limits and show that both , ifsm and pfsm , lead to the same result , namely , the well - known nonrelativistic impulse approximation ( nria ) .",
    "we provide a comparison of the ifsm , pfsm and nria predictions of the gbe cqm  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we examine the effects from different realistic cqms relying on distinct quark - quark dynamics . in particular , we discuss the pfsm results by the gbe cqm in relation to the ones of a one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) cqm , namely the relativistic version of the bhaduri - cohler - nogami ( bcn ) cqm  @xcite as parametrized in ref .",
