    "while comparisons of dibs with other gas - phase species will , of necessity , continue to employ correlations between dib equivalent widths and integrated sight line column densities , the underlying complex structure of the ism ( and the relevant physical and chemical processes ) should be kept in mind .",
    "because correlations between @xmath19(dib ) and @xmath14(x ) reflect both the general increase of all interstellar species with @xmath14(h@xmath15 ) and the multiple factors affecting the abundances of the dib carrier and species x , attention should be given not only to @xmath21 , but to the slope of the relationship and to the scatter and residuals relative to the best fit .",
    "suitable ratios can be used to remove the mutual general dependence on @xmath14(h@xmath15 )  to isolate specific factors affecting the relationship .",
    "while very few dibs have been investigated in detail so far , a few conclusions seem fairly secure : ( 1 ) most of the stronger dibs arise primarily in diffuse atomic gas , but the weaker c@xmath12-dibs are associated with denser , more molecular gas ; ( 2 ) many dibs are correlated better with @xmath13 and @xmath14(h@xmath15 ) than with any individual atomic or molecular species  though several are well correlated with h and some of the narrower dibs are well correlated with na  i and k  i ; ( 3 ) the broader dibs generally have smaller correlation slopes ( e.g. , vs. h@xmath15 ) than the narrower dibs  and may be less sensitive to @xmath28 and more broadly distributed spatially ; ( 4 ) strong radiation fields appear to weaken many of the dibs ( vs. h@xmath15 ) in several regions ( sco - oph , trapezium ) ; additional metallicity - related effects further weaken the dibs in the magellanic clouds ; and ( 5 ) the @xmath19(5797.1)/@xmath19(5780.5 ) ratio ( and possibly others ) can be indicative of @xmath28 .",
    "observations of the dibs in `` unusual '' environments ( e.g. , toward herschel  36 and hd  62542 ) can provide valuable constraints on dib behavior .    with the advent of larger surveys ( many dibs and/or many sight lines )",

    "automated measurement of the dibs  taking into account telluric and stellar absorption and differences in the dib profiles  will be necessary ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
