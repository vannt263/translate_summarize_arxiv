    "the quantum key distribution ( qkd ) based on the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics provides a way for two distant parties , usually named alice ( sender ) and bob ( receiver ) , to share keys for encryption that can be absolutely secret in principle .",
    "generally , we say , a communication channel is secure in the sense that any eavesdropper can be detected by the authorized communication partners .",
    "initially , the discussions and experimentally demonstrations on qkd were concentrated within the setting of discrete variables ( dv ) .",
    "there have been two basic schemes for qubit - based dv qkd , which are the sending of states from non - orthogonal bases , such as the original ",
    "bb84 protocol  proposed in 1984 by bennett and brassard @xcite , and those based on sharing entanglement between the sender and receiver , such as ekert s scheme ( e91 ) @xcite .",
    "so far , a plenty of dv qkd schemes have been presented and its potential application in the long distance secure communication have been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . however , the data transmission rates and the detection efficiency of single photons in dv qkd schemes are strongly restricted by the today availably technical resources . for pursuing high secret key rates , the continuous variable ( cv )",
    "qkd has attracted extensive interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "in addition , another motivation to deal with cv qkd is that the mature technology in quantum optics utilizing continuous quadrature amplitudes of the quantized electromagnetic field , including the preparation , manipulation and measurement of quantum states , can be used directly in cv quantum communication to provide efficient implementation . due to the lack of fast and efficient single - photon detectors available at the moment ,",
    "the nearly unit quantum efficiency of bright - light photodetectors at high speeds becomes the most attractive character for the explorers of cv qkd .",
    "on the other hand , the unconditionalness of cv entangled states emerged from the nonlinear optical interaction in an unconditional fashion is a valuable feature .",
    "earlier , in 1993 j. kimble s group in pasadena accomplished the first experiment on quantum communication based on cv entanglement , in which the idea about the quantum secure communication was involved although the security of the protocol was not analyzed carefully @xcite .",
    "later , the cv entangled states has been successfully applied in various quantum communication protocols to demonstrate the unconditional quantum teleportation , entanglement swapping , quantum dense coding , and so on @xcite .",
    "a variety of cv qkd schemes employing the entanglement of the amplitude and phase quadratures of optical fields were successively proposed . in the scheme proposed by ralph @xcite the entangled epr fields , which are created by combining two independent amplitude - squeezed electromagnetic fields ,",
    "are sent to bob along with their local oscillators .",
    "a random phase shift is added to one of the fields to prevent an eavesdropper from retrieving the information by simple interference at a beam - splitter .",
    "reid proposed a similar scheme exploiting the quadrature entangled fields , in which the protection against eavesdropping is provided by observing a bell inequality violation @xcite . in ref . [ 15 ] , the quantum keys are generated by measuring randomly the amplitude or the phase quadrature of one of the entangled epr optical beams .",
    "any disturbance introduced by an eavesdropper will degrade the correlations and hence possibly be detected .",
    "k. bencheikh et al . proposed a qkd protocol based on cv entanglement , in which the quantum key generation is achieved by distributing each mode of epr entangled optical beams to sender and receiver who perform instantaneous measurements of quadratures @xcite .",
    "the quantum correlation between the measurement outcomes are used to constitute the bits of the random secret key . in these protocols ,",
    "50% of the bits at least are rejected because the base incompatibility and both of epr entangled beams can be intercepted .",
    "obviously , for a given noisy channel the optimal individual attack is to take a fraction of the transmitted signal beam , which equals the line losses at sender s site and then send the remainder to receiver through own lossless line . in this case , the eavesdropper is totally undetected , and gets maximum possible information according to the no - cloning theorem .",
    "although in the above mentioned schemes the two - mode entangling optical fields are utilized , both of the entangling modes can be intercepted , so the security will not be more enhanced than that using a single mode coherent state of light when the optimal attack is used , which has been theoretically demonstrated in ref . [",
    "however , if only one of the entangling modes can be attacked and the other one can be exploited by the authorized receiver merely the entanglement will be helpful for increasing the mutual information between alice and bob and nothing to eve .",
    "based on this idea we propose a cv qkd scheme using the quadrature entanglement of two modes in which the security is enhanced and the transmission efficiency of the secret key is increased due to utilizing quantum dense coding communication .    according to the condition of information theory for secure communication , i.e. , for enabling extraction of a secure key using the error correction techniques and the privacy amplification @xcite , the mutual information between alice and bob , @xmath0 , must exceed the information that either of them shares with eve ( eavesdropper ) , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it has been proved in ref . [ 16 ] that the condition @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) is always violated for the transmission losses beyond 3 db ( 50% ) whatever the carriers of the information are the coherent , the squeezed or the entangled states of light . in the successively completed cv qkd experiments , the 3 db loss limit was beaten by utilizing classical techniques , such as the method of the reverse reconciliation @xcite or the post - selection procedure @xcite .",
    "is it possible to beat the apparent 3 db loss limit only using the presently available quantum resources without demanding either the advanced and the unrealized quantum techniques ( quantum memories and entanglement purification et al . ) or the above mentioned classical methods ?",
    "we note , in all communication schemes discussed by ref .",
    "[ 16 ] the information is transmitted unidirectionally from alice to bob . in this case , the noise added in alice s side cancels out because it disturbs equally eve and bob .",
    "therefore , the security of these protocols does not rely on the noise feature of the used light beams . especially , in the nonmodulated cv qkd scheme",
    "using einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entangled beams proposed by silberhorn et al .",
    "@xcite , alice keeps one of the epr beams and sends the other to bob . however , the photocurrent signals detected by alice are opened on the classical channel , such that it is logically equivalent to a randomly modulated squeezed light beam thus brings no any improvement of security @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a round - trip transmission cv qkd scheme based on epr entanglement .",
    "a source producing epr entangled light beams with the quadrature amplitude and phase correlations is placed inside the station of bob .",
    "only one of the epr beams ( signal beam ) is sent to alice and the other one ( idler beam ) is retained by bob and never opened even its classical photocurrents . for enhancing transmission capacity",
    "we embed the benefits of cv quantum dense coding @xcite in the cv qkd scheme as that done by degiovanni et al . at the dv protocol @xcite .",
    "two sets of independent random numbers are modulated on the amplitude and phase quadratures of alice s epr beam , respectively , then she sends the modulated signal beam back to bob . at bob",
    ", the two sets of signals are simultaneously decoded under the aid of the retained epr beam with the homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "since each half of the epr beams has huge noise individually and the correlation noises between a pair of epr beams are below the shot noise limit ( snl ) , if there is no too much excess noise added in the beams the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) in alice s signal beam must be lower than that decoded by bob with the correlation measurements @xcite .",
    "we found , in this scheme the condition of @xmath4 can be satisfied even when the transmission losses exceed 3 db if higher epr correlation is utilized .",
    "the security of the proposed system is based on the determinative cv entanglement of epr light beams and the quantum no - cloning theorem .",
    "two kinds of eavesdropper attack will be discussed : 1 .",
    "the individual quantum - tap attack to the modulated signal beam on the way from alice to bob or to both unmodulated and modulated beams using an optical beam - splitter according to the requiement of optimal cloning .",
    "2 . the intercept - resend or partial intercept - mixing attack to the non - modulated beam on the way from bob to alice using the simulated epr beams produced by eve .",
    "the calculated results proved that the higher epr entanglement is helpful to beat the 3 db loss limit in the proposed scheme .",
    "the regions of the secure raw secret key , ( @xmath5 ) @xmath6 , as the functions of the line transmission and the epr entanglement correlation factor are calculated .",
    "additionally , like the no - switching cv qkd scheme presented in refs .",
    "[ 17 ] and [ 20 ] , the usual random switching between measurement bases is not required and thus the channel capacity can be significantly improved due to the application of quantum dense coding method .",
    "further , in the dense coding cv qkd scheme we utilize the bright epr beams with the anticorrelated amplitude quadratures and the correlated phase quadratures as well as the bell - state direct detection technique proposed and used in our previous papers @xcite , therefore the local oscillation optical beam is not needed in the bob s measurements for extracting the secret keys . naturally , the protocol dispenses with the technical limitation on the communication bandwidth placed by the local oscillator switching and is relatively simple to implement . here",
    "we should mention although the proposed protocol can beat the loss limit of 3 db in principle , however due to practical difficulties to produce quadrature entangled light with high entanglement degree and highly susceptibility of cv entanglement to loss the reachable communication distance has to be strictly limited by the available entanglement quality .",
    "it has been theoretically demonstrated that the entanglement of a cv resource , though being degraded on a transmission line with loss never vanishes completely for any degree of the loss , thus once the technologies of cv entanglement distillation and purification are exploited the drawbacks will be possible to be overcome @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section the cv qkd system",
    "is described .",
    "the security against the quantum - tap attack and the intercept - resend attack are discussed in the third and the fourth section , respectively .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in the fifth section .",
    "the schematic of the proposed cv qkd system is shown in fig .",
    "the bright epr optical beams , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , with the anticorrelated amplitude quadratures and the correlated phase quadratures are produced from an entanglement source . for experiments , this kind of epr beams",
    "can be obtained with a nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier ( nopa ) below the pump threshold operating in the state of deamplification , which has been well described in ref .",

    "entangled optical beams produced from a nopa operating at deamplification , the variances for each individual beam ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) and the correlation variances are determined by the correlation factor @xmath17 ( or called squeezing factor ) , which depends on the strength and the time of parametric interaction @xcite , @xmath18 @xmath19 where we have assumed that the two modes , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are totally balanced during the process of measurements and this requirement is easily achieved in the experiments .",
    "the values of @xmath17 are taken from 0 to 1 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 correspond to the ideally perfect correlation and no any correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 from nopa have the orthogonal polarizations and can be separated with a polarizing - beam - splitter ( pbs ) .",

    "the extracted beam from @xmath25 ( @xmath7 ) is detected by the balanced - homodyne - detector hd@xmath22 ( hd@xmath23 ) for checking the possible eavesdropper on the way from bob to alice , which will be discussed in section iv . like the cv coherent state",
    "quantum cryptography protocol presented in refs .",
    "[ 18 ] and [ 20 ] , for the optimal information rate both amplitude and phase are modulated with gaussian random numbers @xcite .",
    "alice draws two random real numbers , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , from gaussian distributions with zero mean and a variance of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "then she modulates the amplitude and phase quadratures of the transmitted @xmath7 from r@xmath23 by @xmath26 and @xmath30 with the amplitude ( am ) and phase ( pm ) modulators , respectively .",
    "alice transmits the modulated signal mode @xmath7 back to bob .",
    "we assume that the channel transmission efficiencies from bob to alice and from alice to bob without the presence of eve are identical and equal to @xmath31 .",
    "bob demodulates simultaneously the modulated amplitude ( @xmath26 ) and phase ( @xmath30 ) signals using the bell - state direct detection under the help of the retained mode @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the bell - state direct detection system consists of a 50 - 50 beam - splitter ( bs ) , a pair of photoelectric detectors ( d@xmath22  and d@xmath23 ) , two radio - frequency splitter ( rf1 and rf2 ) , a @xmath32  phase shifter ( ph ) , a positive and a negative power combiner ( @xmath33  and @xmath34 ) . the beams @xmath35  and @xmath36  interfere on the beam - splitter ( bs ) and then the output beams @xmath37  and @xmath38  are directly detected by d@xmath39  and d@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 stands for the vacuum noise added in the quantum channel due to losses .",

    "in the followings we will calculate the physical conditions for satisfying @xmath4 .",
    "it has been theoretically demonstrated by curty et al .",
    "@xcite that the presence of detectable entanglement in a quantum state effectively distributed between alice and bob is a necessary precondition for successful key distillation . in the proposed scheme , the quantum entanglement of quadratures shared by alice and bob is always existent and detectable so far as the original epr entanglement is not exhausted totally by the line losses .",
    "the existence of cv entanglement between alice and bob provides the base of security for the proposed protocol .",
    "the absolute theoretical security of cv qkd protocols against any type of attack has already been proven @xcite .",
    "here we do not address the issue of unconditional security and also do not involve the collective attack , which requires the quantum memory that is not easy to be prepared in today technical condition .",
    "we consider security against individual attacks only .",
    "obviously , at the loss limit the optimal individual attack is that eve replaces the lossy channel by a perfect one with an adapted beam splitter to mimic the losses and then generate a cloned signal with a fidelity depending on the beam splitter transmission . in this case",
    "eve is totally not detected and gets the maximum possible information according to the no - cloning theorem which is the maximum information amount allowed by the laws of physics .",

    "it is obvious from the equations of snr , for the channel with very high losses ( @xmath85 ) the snr will only depend on the variances of the modulated signal , @xmath28 or @xmath29 , thus all figures cross to the same point on @xmath86 axis [ @xmath87 in the case of @xmath77 ] .",

    "the significant reduction of the snrs will clearly reveal the presence of eve also .",
    "although eve might obtained more information by means of the correlation measurement using the epr beams prepared by herself , her presence will be also revealed . of course , if eve has perfect entangled beams and perfect quantum memory the eavesdropping scheme might be better than that totally intercepting . for more detailed discussion",
    "we have to compare the information amounts respectively obtained by bob and eve in this case and find the region for the secure transmission , which have been over the range of this paper .",
    "we proposed a round - trip transmission cv qkd scheme based on the epr entanglement of optical beams .",
    "we mixed the advantage of cv dense coding into qkd , thus the secret key rate is significantly improved . due to bob s simultaneously measuring both amplitude and phase quadratures the randomly switching between measurement bases",
    "is not required , such that the serious technical limitation on the communication bandwidth placed by the local oscillator switching and the technical difficulty of precisely controlling the phase of a local oscillator are not existent any more .    at last , we should mention , although the epr optical beams with the anticorrelated amplitude and correlated phase quadratures are discussed in the paper , the scheme and all calculations are appropriate also to the epr optical beams with the correlated amplitude and anticorrelated phase quadratures ( @xmath155 snl , @xmath156 snl ) , which can be produced from an optical parametric amplifier operating at amplification @xcite . in this case ,",
    "bob only needs to substitute the bell - state direct detection with two sets of the normal balanced homodyne detector as described in the original cv dense coding paper @xcite .",
    "several possible attack schemes have been discussed , however the unconditional security for the proposed protocol has not been demonstrated .",
    "although eve s eavesdropping technologies are various , the discussed attack schemes are representative and usually used .",
    "especially , the discussions about beam - splitter attack are based on the optimal individual attack allowed by the no - cloning theorem of quantum mechanics , thus have common significance .",
    "the theoretical demonstration of unconditional security for the proposed scheme is beyond the scope of the paper and might be remained to be an open question .    due to the sensitivity of the optical quantum entanglement to losses the application of the proposed scheme in the long - distance communication",
    "is limited .",
    "however the proposed scheme have shown the possiblility to beat the loss limit of 3 db using the cv epr entanglement .",
    "along with the development of quantum optical technology the higher and higher determinative cv entanglement can be reached , so the potential of the proposed scheme in future application is expected .                                                                                      am - amplitude modulator , pm - phase modulator , r - reflection rate of the beam - splitter r@xmath22 and r@xmath23 , pbs - polarization beamsplitter , hd - homodyne detection system , @xmath31-channel efficiency , ph-@xmath32  phase shifter , rf - radio - frequency splitter .      fig .",
