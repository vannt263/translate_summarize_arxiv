    "the investigation of the symmetry of the superconducting order parameters is currently one of the most exciting problems in the field of high-@xmath3 research .",
    "@xcite many experiments suggest that the order parameter is anisotropic .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the observation of @xmath4 phase shifts in corner junctions @xciteis consistent with a @xmath5 symmetry of the gap function , although another experiment  @xcite favors a more conventional @xmath0-wave pairing . on the other hand , the occurrence of a finite tunneling current perpendicular to the planes @xcite seems to be incompatible with @xmath1-wave symmetry in a simple picture",
    ". in view of this debate ,",
    "it is important to develop alternative experimental techniques which are able to discriminate between the various symmetries of the gap function . in particular , it is interesting to measure the symmetry of the gap function without the necessity of a tunneling contact , which always includes the problems of a residual magnetic field , trapped flux in the tunneling circuit , or singularities in the supercurrent flow at the corner  @xcite .    on the other hand , optical second harmonic generation has widely been used as a probe for two dimensional optical , electronic and structural properties at various interfaces such as solid - vacuum , solid - gas , solid - solid , solid - liquid , or liquid - gas  @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr - effect has become a new nonlinear optical method for the investigation of low - dimensional magnetic structures  @xcite .",
    "this effect is interface sensitive within the electric dipole - approximation and directly probes , unlike methods based on raman scattering , low - energy magnetic excitations ( @xmath6 mev ) using optical interband transitions ( @xmath6 ev ) .",
    "in contrast to linear optical techniques , the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect yields an excellent signal to noise ratio , since it is free of linear nonmagnetic background radiation .",
    "this advantage manifests itself both in the large magnetic intensity contrast upon magnetization inversion , @xmath7 of about 40 % for fe surfaces@xcite compared to a linear effect of typically 0.1 % and in a giant nonlinear kerr rotation @xmath8 which , depending on the chosen kerr - configuration , can be tuned up to 90@xmath9 nearly at will  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to an enhancement by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude compared to the usual linear kerr rotation , which is even reduced in thin films .",
    "thus , it allows for the determination of the magnetic interface symmetry , including the magnetic `` easy axis ''  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the symmetry of the nonlinear optical susceptibility is strongly affected by a magnetization or an external applied magnetic field .",
    "@xcite thus it is of considerable interest to extend the symmetry analysis of the nonlinear magneto - optical response to the superconducting state for different symmetries of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "therefore , we propose in this paper a new theory for the nonlinear optical response of a superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field , which is able to distinguish between certain symmetries of the gap function and might stimulate corresponding experiments . in the following , we present our theory and show that indeed a symmetry dependent contribution to the magneto - optical response without tunneling contact results in optical second harmonic generation .",
    "although it is , due to the gauge invariance , impossible to measure the phase of the superconducting order parameter without tunneling contact , it is still possible to measure its symmetry , not solely its magnitude .",
    "this results from the interference of different pairing amplitudes in the dipole matrix elements of the _ three _ transitions in nonlinear optics . due to the surface sensitivity of nonlinear optics for systems with bulk inversion symmetry",
    ", one can take advantage of the broken inversion symmetry at the surface .",
    "this is of interest , because cooper pairing , together with the always present spin - orbit coupling , is then no more purely singlet- or triplet - like .",
    "the interference of the singlet and triplet pairing states , which is linear in spin - orbit interaction , leads to the symmetry sensitive contribution of the nonlinear optical response for systems in an external magnetic field .",
    "note that the possible importance of mixed singlet and triplet pairing states at the interface of a tunneling contact between a heavy fermion and a conventional superconductor has already been discussed by fenton@xcite . in order to obtain a more systematic insight into these phenomena ,",
    "we perform the description of a superconductor at the surface of a bulk inversion symmetric system , including spin - orbit interaction and give a group - theoretical classification of the irreducible representations of the gap function .",
    "this is of importance for a detailed calculation of the tensor elements of the nonlinear optical susceptibility which is performed in the second part of the theory .",
    "finally , we present our results concerning the symmetry dependence of the corresponding experiment and discuss in detail the differences of the line shapes of the optical spectra . we find that it is possible to discriminate between an isotropic @xmath0-wave , a @xmath10- or @xmath11- wave and a @xmath12- wave .",
    "however , no symmetry dependent differences between the @xmath10- and the @xmath11- waves occur , which are actually the most discussed symmetries of the high - t@xmath2 systems .",
    "nevertheless nonlinear magneto - optics is shown to be an alternative and complementary method to gain insight into the symmetry of the superconducting gap function .",
    "the strategy of this section is to calculate the effects of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductivity on the nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor @xmath13 , which are due to ( a ) the modification of the bandstructure and thus the resonance denominators and ( b ) due to the symmetry of the superconducting order - parameter affecting the wave functions of the optical electric - dipole transition matrix elements .",
    "thus , we proceed as follows : ( i ) first we set up the superconducting bcs - type hamiltonian and perform its group theoretical analysis . in order to obtain the desired sensitivity of nonlinear optics to the symmetry of the gap function",
    "this requires , as it will turn out , the simultaneous absence of inversion symmetry , presence of an external magnetic field breaking time reversal , and spin - orbit interaction coupling singlet and triplet pairs .",
    "( ii ) making use of this symmetry classification and the mentioned constraints we then calculate the nonlinear magneto - optical response in @xmath0- and @xmath1- wave superconductors from the appropriate current - current - current correlation function and propose a suitable experimental geometry for the observation of this new nonlinear magneto - optical effect in superconductors .    in our theory for the nonlinear magneto - optical response of unconventional superconductors ,",
    "the superconducting state is described within the bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian with arbitrary pairing symmetry and in a magnetic field @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 with the four - component nambu spinor @xmath16 .",
    "here , @xmath17 is the creation operator of an electron with momentum @xmath18 , band index @xmath19 and spin @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21 matrix @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of @xmath23 block matrices : @xmath24 the block matrices are expanded in terms of the unit matrix @xmath25 and the vector of the pauli matrices @xmath26 .",
    "this notation is close to that of sigrist and ueda  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is characterized by the gap function @xmath27 .",
    "we neglect any diamagnetic , i.e. meissner effect of the magnetic field , but assume a large penetration depth at the surface and no influence of the vortex structure to the optical spectrum .",
    "this seems to be reasonable at least for the excitations in the interband regime discussed in this paper .",
    "@xmath28 is decomposed in the usual way in singlet states ( @xmath29 ) and triplet states ( @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 the symmetry of @xmath32 and @xmath33 with respect to the transition from @xmath18 to @xmath34 is a direct consequence of the pauli principle .",
    "since we consider the states at a surface , @xmath18 refers to the two dimensional in - plane momentum .    below the transition temperature @xmath3 ,",
    "the symmetry of a system is reduced compared to the high temperature phase .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath35 of the high temperature phase is determined by the symmetry operations which keep the hamiltonian for @xmath36 invariant .",
    "we consider a system which is for @xmath37 invariant with respect to the group @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the point group , time reversal operation and the gauge group of multiplication of electron creation operator by an arbitrary phase , respectively .",
    "@xcite . in the ordinary case",
    "the normal - state gauge symmetry is broken at the superconducting phase transition , i.e. the residual symmetry group is @xmath42 .",
    "this is called a conventional superconductor . in unconventional superconductors however , the symmetry is lower than @xmath42 . at the transition temperature ,",
    "the bcs - gap equation is an eigenvalue equation and consequently , an eigenvector @xmath43 belongs to one of the irreducible representations @xmath44 of the group @xmath35 . if @xmath44 is the unit representation @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 for systems with inversion symmetry ) conventional superconductivity occurs . in all other cases",
    "the superconductivity is unconventional . in order to discuss the various symmetry states of the order parameter",
    ", one has to generate all irreducible representations of the gap function , where , due to spin - orbit coupling , the spin degrees of freedom can not be transformed independently from the spatial ( orbital ) coordinates .",
    "for various point groups this symmetry classification has been performed  @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the inversion operation @xmath47 is an element of the group @xmath35 .",
    "since we are interested in the investigation of superconducting properties with surface sensitive nonlinear optical experiments , we have to take the effect of broken inversion symmetry into account . in order to be specific",
    ", we consider the surface of a tetragonal system ( bulk point group d@xmath48 ) with residual point group @xmath49 .",
    "this group has five irreducible representations : four of dimension one ( @xmath45 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and one of dimension two ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the isotropic @xmath54 and and anisotropic @xmath55s - waves transform as @xmath45 , the @xmath5-wave as @xmath51 , the @xmath56-wave as @xmath52 , a @xmath57-wave as @xmath50 and the @xmath58 , @xmath59 waves as @xmath53 .    in order to classify the irreducible representations of the gap function",
    ", we have to analyze the transformation properties of @xmath28 .",
    "applying an element @xmath60 of the point group to @xmath61 , the following transformation of the singlet and triplet part results : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 is the representation of @xmath64 which transforms the coordinates .",
    "if one considers the transformation of a pauli spinor with respect to a combination @xmath65 of the inversion operation @xmath66 and a rotation @xmath67 , only the rotational part has to be applied to the spinor , i.e. the representation of @xmath60 in spin space is @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , for the vector in spin space @xmath69 , the representation @xmath70 , where the inversion operation is replaced by the identical transformation , has to be applied .",
    "therefore , one finds in the _ bulk _ of a system with inversion symmetry : @xmath71 , since the vector @xmath72 is not affected directly by the inversion operation .",
    "the minus sign results from the inversion of @xmath18 to @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , in the _ bulk _ , the singlet and triplet part belong to different irreducible representations and either singlet or triplet superconductivity occurs . in distinction to this , a coexistence of singlet and triplet pairing states is possible for systems without inversion symmetry , i.e. at the _",
    "surface_. now , the in - plane inversion operation can be realized by a rotation ( rotation by @xmath4 with @xmath73-axis as rotation axis ) .",
    "this rotation transforms the vector @xmath72 to @xmath74 and the minus sign of the transformation @xmath75 is canceled .",
    "consequently , the irreducible representations of the gap function at the _ surface _ contain both , singlet and triplet parts .    from these considerations one obtains the irreducible representations of the gap function from the simultaneous clebsch - gordon coupling of orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the results for the simultaneously occurring singlet and triplet part of the pairing amplitude are given in the table .",
    "sigrist and rice  @xcite calculated the irreducible representations of the tetragonal group @xmath76 . since @xmath77 , it is straightforward to check the above results by reducing the subduced representations of @xmath76 .",
    "one finds : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 which leads to the results of the table . here ,",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath83 refer to the irreducible representations of @xmath76 with even and odd parity .",
    "the irreducible representations of table  [ tab1 ] are the possible symmetry states of a superconductor on the surface of a tetragonal system and with spin orbit interaction .",
    "if one neglects the spin orbit coupling , the spin and orbital degrees of freedom transform separately and the singlet and triplet pairing states decouple again .",
    "therefore , for a bulk singlet superconductor , the simultaneously occurring triplet part at the surface is of the order of the spin - orbit interaction , and vice versa . in heavy fermion systems",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is large , but even in transition metals one expects this quantity to be of the order of 50 mev which , although being smaller , has nevertheless dramatic consequences such as the reorientation of the magnetic easy axis in thin ferromagnetic films upon the increase of the film thickness or the rise of the temperature .",
    "finally , we expect the spin - orbit induced triplet part to be observable if one considers a surface sensitive experiment such as second harmonic generation .    based on these group theoretical classifications , we calculate now the nonlinear magneto - optical susceptibility tensor of a superconductor and focus on the interference of the simultaneously occurring singlet and triplet part of the gap function .",
    "the optical response in second harmonic generation can be obtained from the nonlinear current - current - current correlation function : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fermi function and the spectral function @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 @xmath88 is the @xmath89-th component of the current operator @xmath90 and @xmath91 is the density of states matrix with hamiltonian @xmath92 of eq .",
    "the trace has to be performed with respect to all single particle states , i.e. the momentum ( @xmath18 ) , band ( @xmath93 ) , spin ( @xmath94 ) and nambu degrees of freedom . in the following , we consider only interband transitions @xmath95 , and the limit of the dipole approximation @xmath96 can be performed without special care for plasmonic excitations .",
    "the evaluation of the trace of eq .",
    "[ nolispec ] is straightforward with the knowledge of the unitary transformation @xmath97 , which diagonalizes @xmath92 and @xmath98 . in the following we discuss @xmath97 for a bulk singlet superconductor in the limit of weak spin - orbit interaction @xmath99 and weak external field because the phase sensitive contributions of the optical response vanish if either @xmath99 or the magnetic field is zero . for weak external magnetic field ,",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath100 where @xmath101 @xmath102 is the absolute mangnitude of @xmath14 and @xmath103 denotes the trace in spin space .",
    "@xmath61 belongs to one of the irreducible representations of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "analogously , the unitary transformation is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the transformations which diagonalize @xmath22 for @xmath37 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "this is correct up to first order in @xmath99 and @xmath14 .",

    "(  [ eigens ] ) .    in order to express the current operator in terms of the nambu spinors",
    ", we have to consider the behavior of the matrix element @xmath122 under the simultaneous transformation @xmath123 and @xmath124 : @xmath125 although the phase factors @xmath126 depend on the choice of the phase of the wannier functions , all observable quantities like @xmath127 are independent of this choice .",

    "(  [ currnam ] ) into the quasiparticle representation , where @xmath131 is diagonal .",
    "consequently , the trace @xmath134 has to be performed with respect to the nambu and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "nonlinear optics and in particular nonlinear magneto - optics offers a unique method to probe low - lying excitations close to the fermi - level with optical photons , since shg , which involves three photons , takes advantage of an additional degree of freedom that is absent in linear optics .",
    "thus it allows to use conventional monochromatic , intense , and tunable pulse laser sources in the ps to fs regime such as mode - locked ti - sapphire lasers . besides , in nonlinear interband optics , there is no collective plasmon background which is material insensitive and",
    "may severely hamper the interpretation of linear optical experiments .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves to a special interband excitation process .",
    "we consider the transition from the initial state @xmath135 with energy @xmath136 , below the fermi energy to the intermediate state @xmath0 at the fermi level ( which is the only superconducting state ) and to the final state @xmath137 with energy @xmath138 above @xmath139 , i.e. we consider @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 . a possible , but not necessary , origin of the states @xmath135 and @xmath137 might be due to the mott - hubbard splitting of the hybridized cu 3d@xmath143 and o 2p@xmath144 orbitals . since the intermediate state is the only state with superconducting coherence , we skip the band index of the matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 . performing finally the traces in eq .",
    "(  [ tr1 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the zero field susceptibility tensor in second harmonic generation within the superconducting state which gives already a contribution without spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the nonvanishing tensor elements for @xmath149 are the same as in the normal state ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "this results here from the transformational properties of the three matrix elements @xmath151 , which transform as the corresponding combination of the coordinates @xmath152 , even if a single matrix element e.g. @xmath153 does not transform like @xmath154 .",
    "the functions @xmath155 result from the numerous combinations of fermi functions and energy denominators which occur by performing the traces in spin and nambu space . @xmath156 is the new contribution of the magneto - optical kerr effect in the superconducting state .",
    "this can be seen from the symmetry relations of the magneto - optical susceptibility @xmath157 which depends on the superconducting gap function not only through its magnitude but also through @xmath158 itselfe .",
    "due to the additional triplet part however , the result is still gauge invariant .",
    "the function @xmath159 correspond to the @xmath155 for @xmath156 . considering a magnetic field parallel to the x - axis ( in plane ) ,",
    "the nonvanishing elements of @xmath160 are : @xmath161 .",
    "this results from the combination of the transformation properties of the normal state matrix elements and of the symmetry sensitive term @xmath162 .",
    "(  [ vmatrix ] ) , the @xmath18-dependence of the latter results from the irreducible representations given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the above matrix elements lead to a rotation of the polarization of the incident light due to the interference of the singlet and triplet states at the surface of a superconductor .",
    "thus nonlinear magneto - optics , unlike linear optical probes , provides indeed an optical method to discriminate different superconducting pairing symmetries by exclusively employing the effect of optical photons to low energy excitations . in the next paragraph , we discuss the numerical results of the above model bandstructure for the most realistic experimental setups and show how experiments can distinguish between certain symmetries of the gap function using nonlinear magneto - optics .",
    "in this section we discuss the numerical results obtained for the tensor elements @xmath163 of second harmonic generation without magnetic field and @xmath164 which gives rise to the rotation of the polarization plane for an applied magnetic field parallel to the @xmath165-axis .",
    "for simplicity we neglect the dispersion of the initial and the final state and consider solely the @xmath18-dependence which results from the superconducting gap function .",
    "the momentum summations are performed within the two dimensional brillouin zone using @xmath166 @xmath18-points .",
    "the calculations are performed for a magnetic field of @xmath167 ( corresponding to a field induced band splitting of 0.5 mev ) and a temperature of @xmath168 .",
    "the magnitude of the singlet part of the gap function is assumed to be @xmath169 .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the dipole matrix elements is estimated to be 10@xmath170 m. all results presented here are not sensitive to the specific set of parameters chosen , but are typical for reasonable values of the corresponding energy scales .",
    "this was checked by systematically varying the dependence of the nonlinear susceptibility on the magnitude of the gap function , the magnetic field , the position of the initial and final states @xmath171 and @xmath172 , the temperature and the linewidth broadening @xmath173 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( b ) , we show @xmath174 and @xmath175 for an isotropic @xmath0-wave . for the conventional shg",
    ", we find a line shape similar to the real part of a lorentzian , which is typical for a three level system discussed in this paper .",
    "more interestingly , the fine structure of the peak , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) clearly shows the energy scale of the superconducting gap . comparing this behavior with the kerr signal @xmath175 of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , one finds that the interference of the singlet and triplet pairing states leads to a line shape with several pronounced zeros and with a fine structure that yields , besides the energy scale of the superconducting gap , also excitations which result from the magnetic field splitting . in all our calculations ,",
    "this line shape was exclusively observed for an isotropic @xmath0-wave and can be considered as a fingerprint of this symmetry .    in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] , the corresponding results for the anisotropic @xmath0-wave and the @xmath11-wave are shown .",
    "although the result for the conventional shg is similar to that of the isotropic @xmath0-wave , a totally different line shape of the kerr signal results .",
    "this is due to the symmetry dependent prefactor in @xmath176 and can be used to discriminate these two symmetries from the isotropic @xmath0-wave .",
    "furthermore the fine - structure of these two symmetries is very different from the isotropic @xmath0-wave . due to the occurrence of nodes in the gap , not only a peak but",
    "a whole broad band between @xmath177 and @xmath178 is observable .",
    "this range is surprisingly given by twice the superconducting gap magnitude .",
    "unfortunately , there are only slight differences between the two symmetries shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this is due to the similar @xmath18-dependence of the triplet part given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "only the fine structure of the peaks displayed in the insets of fig .  [ fig2](b ) and  [ fig3](b ) exhibits a clear difference , where the anisotropic @xmath0-wave has a clear zero at @xmath178 which is more or less smeared out for the @xmath11 wave .    in this context",
    "it is of importance to compare these results to the usual nonlinear kerr effect in the normal state in an external applied field which can be easily estimated using previous results by pustogowa _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as @xmath179 here , the incident photon energy @xmath180 at resonance is 3 ev , while the energy splitting @xmath181 caused by the external magnetic field @xmath102 is 0.5 mev ( see above ) . for this small value of @xmath181 , the formula given in appendix c of the paper by pustogowa _",
    "_ yields a linear dependence .",
    "thus , we find @xmath182 due to the absence of a spontaneous magnetization . from this estimate , it follows that the observability of the new contribution to the nonlinear kerr effect is clearly guaranteed for the anisotropic s - wave .",
    "although , the intensities of the other symmetries are smaller than the estimated value of the usual nonlinear kerr effect in both the normal and superconducting state , we believe that this effect is still observable for the following reason : due to the neglect of the dispersion of the states in our model bandstructure , the disapperance of the signal results from cancellations of contributions of the order of magnitude of the anisotropic s - wave in the @xmath183-summation .",
    "this is due to the artificially high symmetry of this bandstructure .",
    "the simplified description of the high - t@xmath2 materials is used because the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the strong interdependence of the lineshape of the nonlinear magneto - optical susceptibility and the symmetry of the superconducting state .",
    "a more realistic bandstructure immediately leads to larger intensities of @xmath184 , while keeping the characteristics of the line shapes of the spectra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we finally show our results for the @xmath56 symmetry .",
    "although , this symmetry does not seem to be the most probable candidate for the high - t@xmath2 materials , it shows most clearly the symmetry dependence of the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect .",
    "in contrast to the anisotropic @xmath0-wave and the @xmath11 wave , there occurs a sign change between the magnetic and nonmagnetic optical spectrum .",
    "this is observable since the sign of the kerr spectrum determines the direction of the rotation of the polarization axis , i.e. the kerr angle .",
    "furthermore , the satellites shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig4](a ) and ( b ) cover only the range from @xmath177 to @xmath185 , i.e. only one times the gap magnitude .    for the existence of a finite kerr signal ,",
    "it is necessary to break time reversal symmetry and to apply an external magnetic field .",
    "this enables one to keep any direction of the field fixed and to study the anisotropy of the effects discussed in this paper . however , due to the strong but short - ranged antiferromagnetic correlations it might also be possible to take advantage of the locally broken time - reversal symmetry of the high - t@xmath2 materials .",
    "since a finite kerr signal is expected for certain long - range ordered antiferromagnets  , a pump - and - probe experiment ( on a time scale faster than the average lifetime of the local spin configurations @xmath186 ) could be able to resolve the influence of the neighboring spins on the site which is excited by the optical excitation .",
    "furthermore , for a practical realization of the experiment , one has to take into account the possible heating effects of the incoming light on the sample , which might lead to a local disappearance of the superconducting state . in view of the comparable excitation energies of the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect in ferromagnets",
    ", we believe that this effect is of minor importance , since for fs laser pulses sample heating is of the order of 10 k and thus negligible .",
    "this simple estimate is readily obtained from the comparison of laser heating with ns pulses  @xcite yielding intensities of 100 mwm@xmath187 and temperature rises of the order of 100 k and typical fs measurements of the nonlinear kerr - effect  @xcite which operate at laser powers as low as 100 mw focused on spot diameters of 100 @xmath188 m .    in conclusion",
    ", we presented a theory for the nonlinear magneto - optical response of superconductors .",
    "the surface sensitivity of this experiment is of particular interest for the simultaneous occurrence of singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes .",
    "therefore , a suitable material for this experiment is the bi@xmath189sr@xmath189cacu@xmath189o@xmath190 compound , where almost no reconstruction of the cleaved surface ( bi - o layer ) occurs , and where the existence of the superconducting state in the upper cuo@xmath189 layer was clearly shown in photoemission experiments .",
    "since , due to difficulties in the manufacture of the tunneling contacts , all corner junction experiments where so far performed with yba@xmath189cu@xmath191o@xmath192 samples , this gives also insight into the _ symmetry _ of another class of cuprate compounds .",
    "note that furthermore the surface sensitivity does not depend on the actual depth beneath the surface where superconductivity starts , since the electronic symmetry of the superconducting state surface is of relevance in this context which may or may not be perfectly identical to the physical surface",
    ". on the other hand the new nonlinear magneto - optical effect proposed in this paper may also be of considerable importance for interfaces between @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductors .",
    "furthermore , we performed a group - theoretical classification of the irreducible representations of the gap function at the surface of a tetragonal system .",
    "based on this theory , we showed that the interference of singlet and triplet pairing states in a magnetic field leads to a new contribution to the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr signal which is sensitive to certain _ symmetries _ of the superconducting order parameter rather than only to its _",
