    "transport through mesoscopic systems , such as quantum dots , can be achieved through a periodic time - dependent modulation of the system .",
    "this is referred to as _ pumping_. in the regime of adiabatic pumping , the modulation is slow , such that the system can _ almost _ immediately follow the driving .",
    "a directed transport through quantum dots in the absence of a stationary bias ( or , alternatively , also an additional pumping contribution on top of or opposite to transport due to a stationary bias ) is then possible only if there are at least two independent pumping parameters at work .",

    ", we aim to identify additional spectroscopy features in the pumping noise . in the time - independent case with an external bias , there are two system - intrinsic noise contributions , namely thermal ( johnson - nyquist ) and shot noise , where the latter can help to determine the nature of the charge carriers and their statistics .",

    "we , furthermore , consider the case of having an additional , possibly time - dependent , external bias .",
    "for a certain pumping prescription we find in the low - bias regime that the pumping noise is finite even if the time - averaged pumping current , namely its dc component , vanishes .",

    "electrons can tunnel from the leads onto the quantum dot , where the tunneling matrix element is given by the , possibly time - dependent , parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the tunnel coupling strength is characterized by the rates @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and the density of states of lead @xmath12 , @xmath34 . in the following we set @xmath35 .",
    "we want to derive the zero - frequency current noise for the above introduced model , taking into account the coulomb interaction without any further approximation , and treating the case where the quantum system is weakly coupled to the reservoirs .",

    "the current operator @xmath55 simply acts as an external vertex which can be connected to the previously introduced tunneling vertices , via tunneling lines .",

    "now we take the initial time @xmath42 ( before which we suppose the system and the leads to be decoupled ) to the limit @xmath76 . the reason why we did not take this limit previously ,",
    "is that the different integral expressions in eq .",
    "( [ eq_noisepart_det ] ) do not converge separately for this limit .",
    "this is due to the fact that the propagator @xmath77 does not have a finite support , meaning that the propagator does not vanish in the limit @xmath78 going to infinity .    the discussed object , @xmath17 , is periodic in time and it ,",
    "furthermore , enables us to perform in a subsequent step a systematic adiabatic expansion of the noise with respect to time @xmath15 .",

    "_ adiabatic pumping _ , which we focus on ,",
    "this time dependence is taken to be periodic and slow enough such that the system can always almost follow the time - dependent modulation .",
    "this means that the time - scale set by the driving is much larger than the lifetime of electrons in the system . for a small - amplitude modulation of the single - level quantum dot investigated here",
    ", this reduces to the condition @xmath79 ; we will discuss more general conditions later in this section .",

    "( [ eq_noisepart_det ] ) , for the limit of slow driving . to this end",
    "we will perform an expansion in the driving frequency , taking into account the zeroth and the first order in @xmath7 .",
    "the zeroth order , referred to as the instantaneous contribution , describes the situation where the system can be taken to always follow the parameter modulation .",
    "this means that all parameters are frozen to time @xmath15 .",
    "an `` adiabatic correction '' , in first order in @xmath7 , accounts for the actual delay with respect to the instantaneous solution .",

    "we can deduct from the above equations , that in order to justify the adiabatic expansion of the kinetic equation for a general setting , one has to take into account two relevant time scales .",
    "for one there is the dynamics of the density matrix , dominated by tunnelling processes due to coupling to the reservoirs .",
    "since the effect of the tunnel coupling is incorporated in the kernel @xmath51 , the relevant time scale is directly related to the inverse of the magnitude of @xmath51 .",

    "also the current through the system has an instantaneous contribution and a first - order - in - frequency , adiabatic correction .",
    "the first - order correction is exactly the pumping current , in which we are mainly interested . in analogy to the kinetic equation one can compute the current of the system by the respective adiabatic expansion of the current kernel and the reduced density matrix @xmath98 the reduced density matrix , obtained from eqs .",

    "namely , when going away from the electron - hole symmetric point , the pumping noise changes from positive to negative ( negative to positive ) when pump and bias work in the opposite ( same ) direction .",
    "this fact also manifests in the symmetry relations , eqs .",

    "in this paper , we developed a formalism for the calculation of the zero - frequency pumping noise in the adiabatic driving regime in the presence of strong coulomb interaction and a non - equilibrium due to an arbitrary externally applied bias voltage .",
    "we found analytic expressions for the pumping noise containing expectation values of the dot occupation and the current , which are _ local in time_. this allows us to individuate contributions originating from thermal noise , shot noise and pumping noise .    in a first step we applied the developed formalism to the case of pure pumping , in absence of an external bias voltage , up to second order in the tunnel coupling @xmath119 . in zeroth order in the driving frequency ,",
    "the zero - frequency noise fulfills a time - averaged version of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we find that for the correction in first order in the driving frequency , the fluctuation - dissipation theorem breaks down , _ uniquely due to the nonvanishing coulomb interaction_. this is true already in first order in the tunnel coupling @xmath119 .",
    "we study the characteristic properties of the pumping noise based on an analysis of the adiabatic correction of the fano factor .",
    "we find that it exhibits information about the coupling asymmetry to the leads and has a distinct feature , i.e. , a step with a sign change , at the electron - hole symmetric point .",
    "interestingly , the adiabatic correction of the fano factor is insensitive to the specific choice of pumping parameters .",
    "in the second part of this manuscript we addressed the pumping noise in the presence of a finite - possibly large - bias , and eventually including a magnetic field .",
    "we computed an explicit analytical expression for the pumping noise valid for arbitrary bias and magnetic field strength , as well as an arbitrary choice of time - dependent parameters .",
    "based on these we were able to show how the charge dynamics , and ( in the case of a finite magnetic field ) their interplay with spin dynamics , appear in the noise . in the specific case of pumping with gate and bias voltage as time - dependent parameters in particular in presence of a magnetic field , we find that there can be pumping noise in the absence of pumped charge .",
    "the appearance of this additional noise signal can be used to identify whether the time - resolved pumping current vanishes or whether it averages out after one period .",

    "<S> we investigate current - current correlations of adiabatic charge pumping through interacting quantum dots weakly coupled to reservoirs . to calculate the zero - frequency noise for a time - dependently driven system , possibly in the presence of an additional dc bias </S>",
    "<S> , we perform within a real - time diagrammatic approach a perturbative expansion in the tunnel coupling to the reservoirs in leading and next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this formalism to study the adiabatic correction to the zero - frequency noise , i.e. , the pumping noise , in the case of a single - level quantum dot charge pump . </S>",
    "<S> if no stationary bias is applied , the adiabatic correction shows coulomb - interaction - induced deviations from the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the adiabatic correction to the fano factor carries information about the coupling asymmetry and is independent of the choice of the pumping parameters . </S>",
    "<S> when including a time - dependent finite bias , we find that there can be pumping noise even if there is zero adiabatically pumped charge . </S>",
    "<S> the pumping noise also indicates the respective direction of the bias - induced current and the pumping current . </S>"
