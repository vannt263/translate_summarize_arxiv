    "over the past few years various authors have considered the possibility of large extra dimensions as a solution to the discrepancy between the @xmath1 tev scale of standard model physics and the apparent mass scale associated with gravitational interactions @xmath2gev@xmath3 . in these models ,",
    "the standard model particles are confined to a 3 + 1 dimensional brane whilst gravity is free to inhabit all 3 + 1+n dimensions .",
    "the expression for the observed value of g in four dimensions is given by @xmath4 @xmath5 and so it is possible to obtain arbitrarily small values of the higher dimensional fundamental scale @xmath6 provided the radii @xmath7 of the higher dimensions are large enough .",
    "factorisable higher dimensions ( for example higher dimensions compactified on @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) have associated with them an infinite tower of massive kk states which can be produced during high energy scattering of standard model particles on the brane , a phenomenon which may be investigated at the lhc @xmath10 .",
    "the possibility of this kk mode generation has already led to strong constraints on the size and number of higher dimensions from astro - particle physics .",
    "as one of the mechanisms expected to be responsible for the generation of the kk modes is gravi - bremsstrahlung from nucleon - nucleon scattering , the core of a supernova would seem to be a good place to look for the effect .",
    "however , the observed neutrino pulse from supernova 1987a successfully accounted for most of the energy of the collapse .",
    "it was therefore possible to place constraints on the energy lost via this mechanism to kk modes and consequently the radius and number of the extra dimensions @xmath11 .",
    "one would expect the same mechanism to apply to nucleon - nucleon scattering in the early universe ] .",
    "the kk modes corresponding to phenomenologically interesting values of the size of the extra dimensions have lifetimes larger than the age of the universe @xmath12 and dissipate as matter , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "this extra injection of matter leads to an earlier matter - radiation equality which in turn leads to a more rapid decline in the cmb temperature .",
    "the increased cooling rate means that by the time the cmb has cooled to 2.73k the universe is still be much too young to hold the objects we observe in ours .",
    "it is these constraints that are investigated in this paper .",
    "in @xmath14 the angle averaged emmissivity of the plasma into kk modes @xmath15 from a non - degenerate gas of nucleons is shown to be given by the expression @xmath16 where t is temperature , @xmath17 is the isospin averaged nucleon mass @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 is given in the appendix , and the radius of the large extra dimensions r is given by rearranging equation ( @xmath20 ) @xmath21 in ( @xmath22 ) the nucleon - nucleon cross section @xmath23 is evaluated at the peak of the centre of mass energy distribution @xmath24 where @xmath25 so the cross section is evaluated at @xmath26 .",
    "the total s - wave nucleon - nucleon scattering cross section is given by @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the scattering length and @xmath30 is the effective range .",
    "we can obtain approximate values for these parameters by using those experimentally observed for the neutron - neutron @xmath31 channel , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "now we can express the cross section at the peak of the energy distribution in mev@xmath34 @xmath35^{2}}\\ ] ] where t is measured in mev . at this stage",
    "it is worth noting that although the cross section decreases with temperature by a factor of about 2 between 1 mev and 200 mev we will still expect the emissivity to be very temperature dependant because of equation ( [ emiss ] ) .",
    "in order to ensure that we are correct in using the normal 4 dimensional frw equations for our cosmology , we need to make sure that the density of matter in the bulk remains lower than the fundamental planck density @xmath36 by the factor @xmath37 @xmath38 . in this paper where we start with no kk modes , the total density in the bulk",
    "is given by the density lost from the brane divided by the volume of large extra dimensions .",
    "assuming a toroidal compactification manifold these constraints reduce to @xmath39 this inequality is easily satisfied throughout our calculations .",
    "secondly , the rate at which radiation energy density on the brane will evaporate into kk modes in the bulk was obtained in @xmath4 by dimensional analysis .",
    "one can then obtain a temperature at which the cooling of radiation is dominated by this evaporation into the bulk as opposed to the normal cooling due to cosmological expansion .",
    "this temperature , @xmath40 , serves as a maximum temperature up to which the universe can be considered normal. comparing cooling rates : @xmath41 we are only considering events which occur below 170 mev and the case with one large extra dimension has been ruled out by gravitational experiments for all but very high values of @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , only the case with 2 large extra dimensions has a value of @xmath40 below 170 mev and then only for values of @xmath6 below approximately 8 tev which have been ruled out by the supernova work @xmath11 .",
    "having checked the above two validity arguments we can continue with the analysis .",
    "the energy conservation equation for the kk modes in an expanding universe is @xmath42 to convert this into a differential equation with respect to temperature , we use the standard expression for the radiation dominated epoch , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the plasma @xmath45",
    ". these degrees of freedom are given in the appendix .",
    "the radiation energy density is written @xmath46 then we can write @xmath47 the temperature range over which we shall consider the production of kk modes will be from the end of the qcd phase transition ( 170 mev ) downwards . the temperature sensitivity of the kk mode generation rate means the vast majority of any mode production occuring in this range will take place at temperatures just below @xmath48 , or whatever upper temperature we run the equations from .",
    "because the detailed calculations of @xmath14 have been made for the nucleon - nucleon system , we should only use them once the qcd phase transition is over .",
    "that is not to say that there will be no kk mode production by gravi - bremsstrahlung before the phase transition in the quark - gluon plasma for a first approach to this calculation ] , merely that that has not been explicitly calculated at the time of publication and the cosmology of a universe with large extra dimensions becomes increasingly uncertain as one pushes back towards higher energies .",
    "the constraints obtained in this paper will assume that there are no kk modes excited at @xmath48 , only those generated below this temperature will be considered .",
    "inclusion of any kk modes generated above @xmath48 would only strengthen the constraints obtained below .",
    "the qcd phase transition is well below the nucleon mass threshold so the neutrons and protons are non - relativistic and the distribution boltzmann . @xmath49 here g is the number of degrees of freedom , 4 for a nucleon , and @xmath17 is the mass of the nucleon .",
    "any chemical potential corresponding to baryon number conservation will already be small and will decrease with the expansion so will not be included in these calculations .    finally there is a multiplicity factor @xmath50 which takes into account the fact that both n - n and n - p scattering will give rise to kk modes .    bringing these results together",
    ", the rate of energy density generated in the form of kk modes with respect to temperature @xmath51 will be given by @xmath52        the ratio of time vs. the epoch of radiation - matter equality @xmath53 is @xmath45 @xmath54 and the temperature of radiation @xmath55 is inversely proportional to the scale factor @xmath29 . we know that the temperature of the cosmic microwave radiation today is equal to @xmath56 mev . if we also assume that the minimum age of the universe is @xmath57 as determined by the mean observed age of globular clusters @xmath58 then by using equation ( @xmath59 ) we can obtain a maximum temperature for @xmath60 , the temperature at radiation - matter equality .",
    "@xmath61 this is the limit we have to ensure is not broken by an early @xmath53 due to overproduction of kk modes .",
    "limits on the minimum value of @xmath6 obtained for n=2 , 3 and 4 for values of @xmath48=100 , 135 and 170 mev are shown in table @xmath62 .",
    "these values of @xmath48 are quite low and therefore conservative as a higher @xmath48 rapidly increases the number of modes produced .",
    "an example of a situation previously permitted by sn1987a calculations was @xmath63 tev .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] this is no longer permitted even if one assumes that @xmath48 is as low as 100 mev as it leads to an unacceptably high @xmath60 .",
    "if one allows the kk mode production to begin at 170 mev then @xmath6 must be greater than @xmath64 tev for n=2 .",
    "this is no longer a solution of the hierarchy problem .    even if one were to claim that the calculations in this paper were only valid for temperatures far below the qcd phase transition there would still be many other mechanisms by which kk modes could be produced via the bremsstrahlung or annihilation processes of other particles @xmath65 .",
    "it is possible that these constraints could be avoided by some new cosmological evolution which occurs above 1 mev to repect nucleosynthesis but at a temperature below about 100 mev to avoid overproduction of kk modes . until that is achieved",
    "gravi - bremsstrahlung processes in the context of large extra dimensions appear to be at odds with cosmology .",
