    "one suggestion is that scattering from the plateau borders is responsible for the diffusing light@xcite .",

    "this is an indication that fulfilling plateau s second and third laws is of minor importance when one tries to understand the role of liquid films for diffusive transport of light in foams .",
    "even the slight curvature of the films might not be very important since in the ray optics approach it just introduces some additional randomness in the relevant surface normal which varies across the film .",

    "<S> the origin of diffusive transport of light in dry foams is still under debate . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the random walks of photons as they are reflected or transmitted by liquid films according to the rules of ray optics . </S>",
    "<S> the foams are approximately modeled by three - dimensional voronoi tessellations with varying degree of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> we study two cases : a constant intensity reflectance and the reflectance of thin films . especially in the second case </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in the experimentally important regime for the film thicknesses , the transport - mean - free path @xmath0 does not significantly depend on the topological and geometrical disorder of the voronoi foams including the periodic kelvin foam . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the detailed structure of foams is not crucial for understanding the diffusive transport of light . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our theoretical values for @xmath0 fall in the same range as the experimental values observed in dry foams . </S>",
    "<S> one can therefore argue that liquid films contribute substantially to the diffusive transport of light in dry foams . </S>"
