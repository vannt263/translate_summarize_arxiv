    "the discovery of extremely luminous transients in the last years led to their classification as superluminous supernovae , or slsne @xcite . in many of these events ,",
    "the light curve is tens of days wide , so the total radiated energy is of order @xmath4 erg .",
    "the radius of the photosphere at peak luminosity is @xmath5 cm , as inferred from the observed temperature , assuming blackbody emission .",
    "these high values of radiated energy challenge our understanding of the energy source and the conversion mechanism of available energy to radiated energy .",
    "the standard model of core collapse supernovae is that the explosion initiates a shock wave which propagates through the progenitor and deposits about half of the explosion energy as thermal energy and half as kinetic energy of the ejecta ( for a strong shock in an ideal gas ) .",
    "red supergiant ( rsg ) supernovae progenitors have a typical initial radius of @xmath6 cm .",
    "for such a progenitor , as the shock reaches the stellar surface the star is highly opaque , so most of the thermal energy is transformed to kinetic energy of the ejecta via adiabatic expansion , and the fraction of thermal energy which escapes as radiation when the expanding ejecta becomes transparent is roughly @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "other progenitors are even more compact .",
    "therefore , in order to explain the radiated energy in slsne , we must either assume an energy source much larger than @xmath4 erg ( typical for core collapse sne ) , or find a more efficient mechanism of transforming the explosion energy to radiation .",
    "there have been several suggestions of efficient mechanisms for converting the explosion energy into emerging radiation @xcite .",
    "these suggestions are all based upon extensive pre - explosion mass - loss - a wind - by the progenitor star which expels matter to large radii , comparable with @xmath8 . in principle",
    "this can be the result of a burst of mass loss or of a steady wind .",
    "this matter contributes to the radiated energy in two complimentary manners .",
    "the extended mass defines an effective radius @xmath9 , over which the shock deposits the explosion energy ( essentially , creating a `` bloated '' star ) . with this larger radius , less of the thermal energy is lost through adiabatic expansion , and a larger fraction @xmath10 of this energy emerges as radiation .",
    "in addition , this material interacts with the expanding ejecta .",
    "this interaction converts kinetic energy of the expanding ejecta back to thermal energy via shocks propagating forward through the wind material and backward through the ejecta @xcite . in the roughest approximation ,",
    "this interaction between the ejecta and the wind can be regarded as a plastic collision between an ejecta mass @xmath11 moving at a certain velocity and a `` stationary '' wind mass @xmath12 . in this approximation",
    ", a fraction @xmath13 of the ejecta kinetic energy will be converted to shock energy .",
    "if these shocks deposit the energy at a radius @xmath14 then it will escape as radiation without suffering significant adiabatic losses .",
    "we conclude that an excess mass of @xmath15 extending to a radius @xmath14 can convert a substantial portion of the explosion energy to radiated energy and therefore explain the high luminosities of slsne with a conventional @xmath4 erg energy source .",
    "most of the previous works on supernova explosions in a dense mass loss @xcite used simple approximations which allow analytical order of magnitude estimations .",
    "some of these works also drew conclusion from the self - similar solutions of @xcite , which describe the interaction of an expanding ejecta with a wind in the limit where the wind mass is small , @xmath16 , so only the outer layers of the ejecta interact with the wind , and @xmath11 does not create a natural scale in the dynamics . for a more accurate relation between parameters of the star - wind system and the observed light curve ,",
    "a self - consistent hydrodynamic calculation is required .",
    "early numerical calculations of supernova explosion into a dense wind have been carried out by @xcite , and more systematically by @xcite .",
    "these works do not cover well the regime @xmath15 which is of interest in the current work , in order to achieve a high efficiency in terms of generating a luminous light curve .",
    "one exception is the very recent work of @xcite , who conducted several numerical calculations of a light curve for the specific case of sn 2006gy : they considered the relevant mass regime for a similar but different case of a shell set at a standoff distance @xmath8 from an exploding star .    in principle the circumstellar material ( csm ) can be the result of a steady wind or a burst of mass loss during the last stages of the stars evolution .",
    "when the wind is steady the final configuration is a star enclosed in a continuous envelope , while a burst ends with a thin shell of matter situated at some distance from the star . in this work we focus on the steady wind scenario ,",
    "for which the density profile is well defined ( @xmath17 dependence ) , and can be motivated by various aspects of late stages of stellar evolution ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we use hydrodynamic diffusion calculations to conduct a general survey of the relations between the light curve and the progenitor and wind parameters .",
    "we focus on the particular case of a steady wind generated during the last stages of the progenitor star s evolution , so the wind essentially extends from the surface of the star .",
    "our goal is to keep the model as simple as possible , and therefore we adopt many simplifying approximations , which while still sufficient to investigate the key features of light curves in the interacting ejecta and wind scenario , are also simple enough to be instructive and the results are easily understood .",
    "the simplifications we applied are detailed below .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in   [ sec : progenitors ] we present our model for general slsn progenitor systems . in ",
    "[ sec : qualitativepicture ] we consider the qualitative relations between the system parameters and the observed light curve , and analytically examine various limits of the problem .",
    "the hydro - diffusion code is described in   [ sec : the_code ] and numerical results are presented in ",
    "[ sec : numerical_results ] .",
    "the observed light curves of three specific candidates for an interacting ejecta and wind scenario , sn 2005ap , sn 2006gy , and sn 2010gx are analyzed and reproduced in   [ sec : observations ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in our scenario the progenitor systems is composed of two parts : the gravitationally bound compact star , and the outer material which is created by pre - explosion mass loss .",
    "both are characterized by their total masses and respective density profiles .",
    "since the supernova explosion induces temperatures much higher than the initial star temperatures , and ejecta velocities much higher than the initial wind velocity , both the star and wind are approximated as initially stationary and cold .",
    "the explosion can then be treated as an instantaneous release of thermal energy @xmath18 at the center of the star ( @xmath19 ) .    for systems in which the photosphere lies at @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 the details of the structure of the progenitor star are unimportant in terms of the resulting light curve , since the star can be considered as a point object .",
    "none the less , we do want to allow also for calculations of systems where the wind mass is much smaller than the ejected mass , mainly for comparison with other works which investigated these cases ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we follow @xcite by modeling the progenitor star by a polytrope with radius @xmath22 , mass @xmath23 , and polytropic index @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is suitable for convective envelopes , like those in rsgs , while @xmath26 is used to describe radiative envelopes , such as those in blue supergiants ( bsgs ) .",
    "we approximate the star by applying the lane - emden equation to the whole star , not only to the outer envelope .",
    "thus , @xmath22,@xmath23 , and @xmath24 completely determine the initial density profile of the star .",
    "note that since the lane - emden equation is applicable only for the envelope , @xmath23 actually denotes the envelope mass , and not the star mass .",
    "all these approximations are valid since the inner structure of the mantle has little effect on the shock wave propagation .",
    "the mantle can be considered as a point mass which is added artificially ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in terms of size , a @xmath27 progenitor should actually be modeled by a @xmath28 structure , to allow for the @xmath29 mantle .    for the wind density profile ,",
    "we follow @xcite and @xcite and consider a steady wind with mass loss rate @xmath30 and wind velocity @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting density profile is @xmath32 we impose this wind density profile by continuously attaching it to the polytropic structure of the star at a radius where the polytrope and equation coincide . for the parameters chosen in this work ,",
    "this wind base radius is essentially at @xmath22 .",
    "the wind is assumed to continue to an outer radius @xmath33 so that its total mass is @xmath34 for @xmath35 , which is the case of interest in this work , equation is reduced to @xmath36 for numerical convenience , we smooth the wind edge at @xmath33 . instead of cutting the wind abruptly at @xmath33 , we extend the wind to a larger radius @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( we usually choose @xmath39 ) and change the wind density profile from equation to @xmath40 with @xmath41 providing a sharp power law .",
    "the details of this smoothing have a minor effect on the results .    since the light curve is mostly dominated by the structure of the wind material , we mostly survey the wind parameters and fix the parameters of the star .",
    "we choose a star with @xmath42 cm , @xmath43 , and @xmath25 .",
    "these values are representative of a typical rsg .",
    "we study the case @xmath35 , for which the value of @xmath22 has little effect on the light curve .",
    "the value of @xmath24 ( 3/2 or 3 ) also does not effect the results in the regime of interest .",
    "however , the value of @xmath23 does has a significant effect on the light curve , and the choice of @xmath27 is arbitrary .",
    "some consequences of changing @xmath23 are discussed in   [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the motivations described in   [ sec : introduction ] lead to the choice @xmath44 cm ( the relation @xmath45 is justified in   [ sec : qualitativepicture ] ) and @xmath46 , which , using equation , sets @xmath47 .    to summarize , our progenitor system is thus modeled by 4 parameters : the star mass @xmath23 , the explosion energy @xmath18 , the wind outer radius @xmath33 , and the wind density coefficient @xmath48 from equation . after fixing the star mass , we are left with 3 parameters which determine the properties of the light curve .",
    "the supernova explosion initiates by a strong shock wave , which when close to the edge of the star becomes radiation dominated .",
    "diffusion of energy carried by radiation causes the shock to develop a finite width with optical depth @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is the shock velocity and @xmath51 the speed of light .",
    "this optical depth can be intuitively understood by equating the hydrodynamical time scale and the diffusion time scale over the shock front . at large optical depths from the surface , @xmath52 , the shock wave",
    "can still be treated as an ideal discontinuity , and diffusion can be neglected .",
    "when the shock approaches the surface , and @xmath53 , energy can escape by diffusion to the surface , and and the shock dissolves ; the purely hydrodynamical ( with diffusion neglected ) solutions are no longer valid . at this stage",
    "the shock is said to `` breakout '' .",
    "shock breakout through the outer layers of a bare star has been discussed in several works .",
    "these rely on the self similar solution found by @xcite for a planar shock propagating through the steeply declining density profile at the edge of the star ; see @xcite for a complete derivation .",
    "@xcite expanded this self similar solution to include diffusion and thus calculate a light curve under these conditions , again - for the plane - parallel case . in the presence of an extended wind , due to a pre - explosion mass loss from the progenitor , shock breakout must be considered in spherical symmetry .",
    "as the outgoing ejecta plows through the wind and slows down , it drives a forward shock through the wind and a reverse shock that propagates back into the ejecta , and it is the combined shock profile which eventually breaks out as it reaches a low optical depth region in the wind .",
    "our focus is on the case where @xmath15 , so the entire ejecta participates in the shock breakout , and the light curve is the result of the breakout through the opaque wind @xcite .",
    "while no self - similar solution exists for the general case , we can still quantify several important conclusions about the typical time scale of the light curve .",
    "we can also draw some insight from the two extreme limits where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if the wind mass is much larger than the ejecta mass , the dynamics are similar to the sedov - taylor explosion , but with a power law ambient density instead of a constant one . in the opposite extreme limit ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the self - similar solution of @xcite can be used to model the combined forward and reverse shock .",
    "for such a configuration only the initial light curve will be the result of shock breakout through the wind @xcite , followed by the main light curve driven by the internal energy held by the bulk of the ejecta . in the following",
    "we examine the estimates that can be made about the resulting light curve from these solutions and other considerations ; the qualitative picture we draw serves to clarify the numerical results presented in the later sections .      as the forward shock propagates through the wind , it breaks out when it reaches optical depth @xmath56 .",
    "we adopt the assumption of constant opacity , which is appropriate for electron ( thompson ) scattering ( a similar assumption was adopted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath57 is , of course , composition dependent , ranging between @xmath58 for hydrogen free matter and @xmath59 for pure hydrogen ( we usually used @xmath60 which is appropriate for a 70% hydrogen composition ) . in this case of constant opacity",
    "the optical depth from a radius @xmath61 to the edge of the wind is given by @xmath62 therefore , the shock breaks out at radius @xmath63 which satisfies @xmath64 following @xcite we denote @xmath65 and rewrite equation as @xmath66    @xcite discussed the breakout at the two limits : @xmath67 our focus is on the intermediate case of @xmath68 , which appears to be motivated by observations .",
    "note that as long as the wind mass is of order the ejecta mass , the shock velocity naturally tends to @xmath69 , so for the parameters chosen in ",
    "[ sec : progenitors ] , @xmath70 cm .",
    "the main features of the observed light curve are total radiated energy , the peak luminosity and the typical width .",
    "the three are connected , of course , through the emission of the thermal energy at shock breakout by photon diffusion through the wind .",
    "being an integral quantity , the total emitted energy , @xmath71 is expected to follow the plastic collision picture described in ",
    "[ sec : introduction ] giving the simple relation @xmath72    the typical timescale in the light curve must depend not only on integral quantities , but on the details of the wind profile as well .",
    "we estimate the time it takes the shock energy to diffuse to the surface following breakout as follows .",
    "first , we note that the photons do not diffuse all the way from @xmath63 to the surface , but rather to the radius of the photosphere @xmath8 which is located at @xmath73 ( specifically @xmath74 for eddington s approximation ) .",
    "using equation , @xmath8 is given by @xmath75 for the case @xmath76 , equation yields @xmath77 . according to equation @xmath78 in this case as well , so the shock breaks out very close to the edge of the wind and we can assume a constant diffusion coefficient @xmath79 and a diffusion distance ( see equations , , and assuming @xmath80 ) of @xmath81 which results in a diffusion time @xmath82 in the opposite limit , @xmath83 , and so @xmath84 . since the shock velocity is far from relativistic , we also have @xmath85 .",
    "these relations imply , according to equation , that @xmath86",
    ". in this case shock breakout evolves through the diffusion of radiation to the photosphere , and the diffusion time can be estimated by considering the change of the density - dependent diffusion coefficient @xmath87 after substituting a @xmath88 density profile the integration yields @xmath89 combining this result with equations and gives a general expression for the diffusion time for any @xmath33 . by substituting @xmath90 from equation and @xmath8 from equation , and using @xmath86 we summarize the diffusion time at both limits : @xmath91 \\frac{\\kappa k}{c}\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{v_{\\rm sh}}\\frac{1}{1+\\left[\\kappa k / r_w\\right]}\\right)-1\\right ] & r_w\\gg r_d \\end{cases}.\\ ] ] equation gives a diffusion time which is monotonically increasing with @xmath33 in both limits , but more mildly at large @xmath33 . for @xmath92",
    "the diffusion time reaches an asymptotic value of @xmath93\\sim\\frac{\\kappa k}{c}\\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{v_{\\rm sh}}\\right).\\ ] ]    the expression @xmath94 , sometimes with the logarithmic correction mentioned , was used in previous works @xcite to estimate the order of magnitude of the light curve time scale .",
    "indeed , for @xmath95 ( see   [ sec : progenitors ] ) , this time scale is @xmath96 days , which is consistent with the time scale in the relevant observations @xcite .",
    "however , since we are interested in the regime where @xmath97 and @xmath33 are of the same order of magnitude , a more careful analysis is necessary and we must take into account the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath33 , which is evident in equation . note that the parameters chosen in   [ sec : progenitors ] do dictate that @xmath99 , which means , according to equation , that the radius of the photosphere @xmath8 is roughly the wind radius @xmath33 .",
    "thus , our choice of @xmath100 cm , motivated by the observed photosphere radius ( see   [ sec : introduction ] ) is self consistent .    in general",
    ", the shock velocity changes with radius , and we can roughly estimate that in the regime @xmath15 @xmath101 with @xmath102 is the accumulated mass enclosed by @xmath63 . when @xmath50 is a function of @xmath63 , and therefore a function of @xmath33 the functional dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath33 can be more complex than presented in equation .",
    "nonetheless , we can gain significant insight by relateing @xmath50 to the progenitor system parameters in the limits where self - similar solutions exist .",
    "the fundamental point is that for a fixed value of @xmath48 , the limit @xmath83 also corresponds to @xmath54 , while in the opposite case of @xmath103 we also have a low mass wind , @xmath55 .    in a very massive wind dimensional analysis",
    "similar to the sedov - taylor problem ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be applied , leading to a shock radius and shock velocity which evolve as @xmath104 however , since in this limit breakout occurs at @xmath90 , independent of @xmath33 , the shock velocity at breakout is also independent of @xmath33 .",
    "equation provides a qualitative understanding of the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath48 and @xmath18 ; neglecting the logarithmic correction , we have ( for @xmath83 ) @xmath105    for a very low mass wind , @xmath106 can be found with the alternative self - similar solution of @xcite who studied the interaction of ejecta , with the unshocked density profile @xmath107 , and wind with density profile @xmath108 . in our case @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "can be related ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the polytropic index @xmath24 : @xmath111 ( for @xmath26 ) or @xmath112 ( for @xmath25 ) .",
    "the shock propagates in time with radius @xmath113 and with velocity given by @xmath114 combining equation with equation results in an inverted dependence of the diffusion time on @xmath48 in the regime @xmath103 : @xmath115 in this regime @xmath78 and , using equation , we have @xmath116 this is a weak dependence on @xmath33 , which would result in a small deviation from the relation @xmath117 of equation .",
    "the inversion of the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath48 between limits ( linear in @xmath48 for @xmath83 and inverse for @xmath103 ) suggests a weak dependence on @xmath48 for the intermediate regime .",
    "we note that , in theory , if the sedov - taylor solution were applied to the @xmath103 case , by combining equation with equation , we would also have the @xmath118 dependence , implying the robustness of this result .",
    "we conclude that when identifying the limits of @xmath83 and @xmath103 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , then at both limits @xmath50 is approximately constant ( a different constant for each limit ) , justifying equation .",
    "we expect the region @xmath15 to exhibit some deviation from these time scale estimates .",
    "we have written a 1d lagrangian computer program in order to calculate the shock propagation and light curve . in this section",
    "we describe the code in brief .",
    "the code uses the standard von neumann and richtmyer staggered mesh method @xcite to solve the nonrelativistic equations of motion .",
    "the energy equation is solved implicitly , and the radiative flux is added to the hydrodynamics assuming local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and in the diffusion approximation ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more specifically , the code solves the following energy equation ( implicitly , solving a tridiagonal equation system ) :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the specific energy , @xmath121 the specific volume and @xmath122 is the pressure .",
    "@xmath123 denotes the radiative flux , with @xmath124 as the diffusion coefficient , and @xmath125 the radiation constant .",
    "the temperature @xmath126 in equation is the temperature of the fluid ( a result of the lte assumption ) . in the case of constant opacity ,",
    "the mean free path satisfies @xmath127 .",
    "gravitation can be neglected for the description of the shock propagation and breakout , since @xmath128 .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) is that of a perfect gas , with radiation terms added to the pressure and energy : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the gas constant divided by the molar mass . in the examples shown in this section we choose @xmath131 , suitable for monoatomic gas and @xmath132 which corresponds to a fully ionized mixture of hydrogen and helium with primordial ratios . in the context of shock",
    "breakout the energy and pressure of the fluid are dominated by radiation after the shock passage and during the period of adiabatic expansion which follows , so these terms have a minimal effect on the equation of state and the light curve .",
    "the assumption of thermal equilibrium and the validity of the diffusion approximation are reasonable for nonrelativisitc shocks @xcite , and we rely on them here for our estimates .",
    "we do note that near the photosphere during shock breakout @xcite transport , rather than diffusion , is a more appropriate description of the photon propagation , which we will apply in future work .    as a code check",
    ", we calculated several test problems with our program and compared the results to known solutions . among the test problems we considered",
    "are the self similar interaction of ejecta and wind @xcite , elliot s extension to the sedov - taylor explosion which includes radiative flux @xcite , and planar shock breakout @xcite .",
    "we present our results for the planar shock breakout in the appendix .",
    "we present an example of a calculation in figures [ fig : tmp_prof ] and [ fig : tmp_prof_curve ] .",
    "figure [ fig : tmp_prof ] shows the temperature profiles at different times .",
    "the transition from a discrete shock front to breakout at @xmath56 , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : qualitativepicture ] , is evident in the late time ( 50 days after explosion ) profile . in figure",
    "[ fig : tmp_prof_curve ] the corresponding light curve is presented .",
    "it can be seen that the emergence of a light curve and its duration correspond to the shock breakout time scales .      as a final test",
    ", we compared our numerical results with those of @xcite who also studied the effect of a wind on light curves .",
    "their work focused on less dense winds and using a more complex numerical model which we do not try to reproduce .",
    "however , we can compare our calculations to the progenitor - wind model which is the most relevant to the regime studied in the current work : model s15w2r20m1e3 , marked as @xmath133 in figures 3,4 of @xcite , which has a wind mass of @xmath134 . in figure",
    "[ fig : moriya ] we show a comparison between the light curve calculated with our code and their results .",
    "our light curve was calculated using the progenitor profile given in figure 3 of @xcite , which is slightly different from our standard @xmath43 progenitor ( see   [ sec : progenitors ] ) .",
    "the resulting relevant light curve parameters ( peak luminosity , time duration , and total radiated energy ) are the same up to few percents .",
    "in this section we study the light curves calculated with the code and conduct a parameter survey in order to map the dependence on the important parameters .",
    "we also verify that the analytical limits presented in   [ sec : qualitativepicture ] are recovered , and use them to gain insight to the results .      following a convergence test ,",
    "we model the compact star part of the progenitor system with @xmath135 cells , geometrically decreasing in size @xmath136 toward the outer edge with a quotient @xmath137 .",
    "the wind is divided into @xmath138 cells , geometrically increasing in size ( with a constant quotient @xmath139 ) toward the outer wind edge .",
    "the innermost wind cell is of the same size as the outermost star cell .",
    "the size of the innermost wind cell , together with @xmath140 , determine @xmath141 .",
    "in these calculations we use the smoothing parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( see   [ sec : progenitors ] ) . generally , we set @xmath144 cm , except for very low values of @xmath33 , for which we had to reduce the star radius , @xmath22 , in order to remain in the regime @xmath145 .",
    "additionally , we had to change the resolution for convergence and to disable the wind edge smoothing ( see   [ sec : progenitors ] ) .",
    "these changes have an effect only at very low @xmath33 .",
    "we relate the diffusion time scale @xmath98 with the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the light curve .",
    "this choice is independent of the low luminosity `` tail '' at late times , which arises in part from the continued interaction of the shock wave and the wind @xcite , and is sensitive to the shape of the wind cutoff profile .",
    "the results , for @xmath146 erg , @xmath147 , and a wide range of @xmath33 are shown in figures [ fig : range_small ] and [ fig : range_big ] .",
    "both figures demonstrate that the calculated light curves do indeed reproduce the analytic timescales at the appropriate limits .",
    "the fit is very good at low values of @xmath33 , while at high values there is some deviation from equation .",
    "the reason is that the simplified treatment of diffusion in the code extends all the way to @xmath33 , whereas our analytic estimates were based on emission from a @xmath148 ( or @xmath74 ) surface .",
    "a more exact fit of the numerical results is therefore found with a revised analytical estimate of the diffusion time using equation , and substituting @xmath149 : @xmath150=\\frac{\\kappa k}{c}\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{v_{\\rm sh}}\\frac{r_w}{\\kappa k}\\right)-1\\right].\\ ] ] unlike equation , equation does not reach an asymptotic value at @xmath151 .",
    "correspondingly , our numerical calculations which do not take into account the photosphere at @xmath73 are inexact in this sense . however , since we deal with the regime @xmath99 , the difference between equations and is small ( see figure [ fig : range_big ] , which even approaches @xmath152 ) , so the numerical treatment of the photosphere is sufficient for our purposes in the current work .",
    "as is obvious from the qualitative discussion in ",
    "[ sec : qualitativepicture ] and from figures [ fig : range_small ] and [ fig : range_big ] , the range of @xmath33 of interest in this work ( @xmath100 cm ) can not fit well to any of the analytical limits .",
    "henceforth we conduct a numerical parameter survey in this range .",
    "we begin by examining the relation between the diffusion time , @xmath98 , and the parameters of the progenitor system , namely @xmath18,@xmath48 and @xmath33 , whereas for simplicity we fix @xmath43 .",
    "we study the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath33 for a nominal calculation with @xmath153 erg and @xmath154 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath18 and @xmath48 is studied by repeating the calculations with other values of @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : time_k ] and [ fig : time_e ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath98 with increasing @xmath33 is understood qualitatively by equation .",
    "quantitatively , we see that @xmath98 is strongly dependent on @xmath33 throughout the relevant range , so the approximation @xmath157 @xcite can serve only as an order of magnitude estimate .",
    "this behavior is also evident in figure 9 of @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : time_k ] , the dependence of the diffusion time on @xmath48 is in good agreement with the analysis of   [ subsec : ltdiff ] . at large @xmath33 ,",
    "the diffusion time increases roughly linearly with @xmath48 , but for lower @xmath33 the dependence becomes weaker and is finally inverted , as expected in low mass wind ( see equations , ) , yielding smaller diffusion times for larger values of @xmath48 .",
    "we also recover the @xmath118 relation expected at low @xmath33 ( again , see equation ) . the dependence becomes weaker at larger @xmath33 , as might be expected from equation .",
    "the other feature in the light curve which we relate to the parameters of the progenitor system is the total radiated energy .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_lum ] shows the dependence of the radiated energy on @xmath48 for different values of @xmath158 and for a fixed @xmath159 cm .",
    "we calculate the radiated energy by integrating the light curve until the luminosity drops to 0.1% of the maximum luminosity .",
    "the behavior exhibited in figure [ fig : energy_lum ] is qualitatively understood by the plastic collision relation ( equation ) , thereby saturating when @xmath160 .",
    "using , @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "we digress and discuss the shape of the light curve because the total radiated energy is not always reliably observed .",
    "when observations are limited to the vicinity of peak magnitude and do not track low luminosities , the shape of the light curve must be modeled theoretically to asses its total energy .",
    "one such model uses the observed peak luminosity @xmath163 and the observed fwhm of the light curve , and , assuming a gaussian light curve @xcite , @xmath164 .",
    "we plot this estimate of the radiated energy ( using the calculated peak luminosity and the fwhm of the calculated light curve ) as dashed lines in figure [ fig : energy_lum ] .",
    "it is obvious from figure [ fig : energy_lum ] that as the wind becomes more dense , this simple estimate deviates more from the total radiated energy ( compare the solid and dashed lines in figure [ fig : energy_lum ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the late time `` tail '' strongly deviates from a gaussian form , and includes much more energy than predicted by a gaussian approximation .",
    "this tail is partially powered by continued interaction of the shock wave and wind @xcite and thus becomes more prominent and contains more energy .",
    "we can conclude that total energy estimates based on observations should be done carefully , and that a gaussian fit must be treated as a lower limit if only the vicinity of the peak region of the light curve is observed .      in this work we focus on winds with radius @xmath100 cm .",
    "the justification we gave for this choice is the observed photosphere radius @xmath165 cm and the relation @xmath45 which is valid for @xmath15 ( see   [ sec : qualitativepicture ] ) .",
    "one of the conclusions of the numerical results is that the observed light curve time scale gives another constrain on @xmath33 .",
    "we demonstrate this point in figure [ fig:2010timescale ] , where we show the light curves calculated for three combinations of @xmath48 and @xmath33 , all of which satisfy @xmath166 g , so that the total wind mass is kept constant .",
    "the intermediate model with @xmath159 cm is used below to fit sn 2010gx ( see   [ sec : observations ] ) , while the other two are more compact and extended winds ( note that for the extended wind , the approximation @xmath99 which our code assumes is marginal ) . by keeping the total wind mass constant the efficiency of converting a given explosion energy to radiated energy is fixed ( for a given progenitor star mass ) and so the light curve time scale becomes a direct indicator of the wind radius .",
    "it is obvious that for time scales of @xmath167 days , as is the case of sn 2010gx , the models with the more compact and more extended winds are ruled out .",
    "in this section we relate our model to slsne observations .",
    "specifically , we focus on three events : sn 2010gx , sn 2006gy and sn 2005ap . our goal is to ascertain that a steady wind model can provide a viable explanation for the observed slsne light curves , and to constrain the likely parameters of the progenitor system . in general ,",
    "previous works which considered a star - wind system @xcite provided only order of magnitude correlation between the steady wind model and the observations .",
    "very recently , @xcite have presented a specific numerical model for sn 2006gy where the ejecta interacts with a a distant shell ( rather than a steady wind ) , and we comment on the similarities and differences regarding this specific object below .",
    "we take the data for sn 2010gx from @xcite .",
    "the measured luminosity and temperature imply a blackbody radius @xmath168 cm at peak luminosity .",
    "since the photosphere lies close to the wind edge ( see   [ sec : qualitativepicture ] ) , we choose a model with @xmath159 cm ( the photosphere expands following the passage of the shock ) .",
    "we find that the light curve is recovered well when setting the other parameters to be @xmath147 and @xmath169 erg .",
    "the quality of the fit is shown in figure [ fig : sn2010gx ] , which compares the calculated and observed light curves .",
    "it is noteworthy that we do include a correction for the difference in arrival times of photons originating from different positions on the photosphere @xcite .",
    "this effect on the time scales is @xmath170 , which is about a day , and therefore negligible in the cases considered here .",
    "the corresponding blackbody temperature for the calculated light curve is compared with temperatures inferred from observations in figure [ fig : sn2010gx_tmp ] .",
    "we emphasize that the calculated blackbody temperatures are recovered using the luminosity , @xmath171 , and identifying the photosphere , @xmath172 , with the position where the optical depth is @xmath74 , @xmath173 clearly this determination of the blackbody temperature is a crude one , and , in fact , the blackbody assumption must generally be considered only as an approximation @xcite .",
    "therefore , we view the fit between calculated and observed temperatures as indicative that our model is compatible with observations ..    considering the simplifications of our approach , we do not attempt to find a `` best fit '' model for the progenitor system , but rather demonstrate that a plausible range exists .",
    "moreover , we emphasize that the wind parameters we choose to fit are not unique",
    ". if we fix @xmath159 cm , as implied by the temperature measurement , we have a considerable degree of freedom to choose @xmath48 .",
    "the reason is the weak dependence of the diffusion time on @xmath48 for this @xmath33 , as seen in figure [ fig : time_k ] .",
    "the total radiated energy is also not strongly effected by an increase of @xmath48 , as seen in figure [ fig : energy_lum ] .",
    "this is because @xmath174 is close to the saturation region of equation and figure [ fig : energy_lum ] .",
    "more specifically , a different model with @xmath175 ( double the chosen value ) , results in a light curve with the same peak luminosity as the model in figure [ fig : sn2010gx ] and fwhm wider by only 15% .",
    "in addition , we tested a model with @xmath176 , which is appropriate for a hydrogen poor csm , as indicated by sn 2010gx observations @xcite .",
    "this change has a small ( less than 10% ) effect on the light curve and a negligible effect on the temperature , due to the change from inverse to linear dependence on @xmath57 in equation ( which results in a weak dependence at @xmath177 ) .",
    "we take the data for sn 2006gy from @xcite .",
    "the measured luminosity and temperature imply a blackbody radius @xmath178 cm at peak luminosity .",
    "if we do not consider the temperature constraint , a model which fits the light curve can be found . the model with @xmath179 cm , @xmath180 , and @xmath146 erg , which reasonably fits the light curve except for the tail ,",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig : sn2006gy ] ( solid black line ) .",
    "we shall distinguish this model as model a. the wind mass in this model is @xmath181 , which is similar to the estimates of previous works @xcite .",
    "model a may fit the light curve , but since @xmath33 in this model is larger than the implied blackbody radius , it deviates from the temperature measurements , as can bee seen in figure [ fig : sn2006gy_tmp ] .",
    "we find that a model in a different range of the progenitor parameters can be chosen to reproduce the observed temperatures ( assuming a blackbody emission ) and the peak luminosity , but at the expense of generating a light curve which is too narrow .",
    "one such model , distinguished as model b , is also plotted in figures [ fig : sn2006gy ] and [ fig : sn2006gy_tmp ] . in this model",
    "we set @xmath182 cm , @xmath147 , and @xmath183 erg .",
    "the light curve is narrow due to the strong dependence of the diffusion time on @xmath33 , which allows little freedom ( see   [ sec : time_scale ] ) . as a result",
    ", we can not find a single model which fits well both the light curve and the measured temperature .",
    "this is easily understood by considering the analysis in   [ sec : relation ] .",
    "if we use the wind radius fixed by the observed peak luminosity and temperature , then for a given progenitor star only two free parameters remain : @xmath48 and @xmath18 .",
    "model b ( which assumes the observationally inferred @xmath33 ) is adjusted to reproduce the observed peak luminosity , but it results in a narrow light curve , yielding a total radiated energy which is too low . the total radiated energy can not be increased by increasing @xmath48 , because at @xmath147 the efficiency of converting the explosion energy is already close to the asymptotic value ( see figure [ fig : energy_lum ] ; we note that in this figure @xmath159 cm ; for @xmath182 cm , asymptotic efficiency is reached for even smaller values of @xmath48 , due to the larger wind mass ) . stipulating a larger explosion energy @xmath18 can account for the total radiated energy , of course , but it is not a solution , since it leads to even narrower light curves , due to larger expansion velocities ( see figure [ fig : time_e ] ) . in theory",
    ", the desired effect can be obtained by increasing both the total energy and @xmath48 ( the latter compensating for the narrowing of the light curve , since it generates a more massive wind ) .",
    "however , the dependence of the diffusion time on @xmath48 is weak for @xmath33 in the range of interest ( see figure [ fig : time_k ] ) , and we determine that in order to reproduce the observations , an unrealistically heavy wind mass ( hundreds of solar masses ) is required .",
    "we note that the fit with observations can not be improved by stipulating a larger mass for the progenitor star .",
    "while an increasing @xmath23 leads to a decrease in @xmath50 and thus to wider light curves , it works to reduce the efficiency of converting the explosion energy to radiation .",
    "we found that even tripling @xmath23 ( together with @xmath12 , to keep the efficiency ) , which again results in unrealistically large masses , does not widen the light curve enough .",
    "in essence , it appears difficult to reconcile both the observed light curve and temperature of sn 2006gy with a steady wind model , since the light curve time duration implies a wind radius @xmath33 that is different from the one inferred by the photosphere radius .",
    "the reason may be the blackbody interpretation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which effects the calculated temperature , an inaccurate assumption of full ionization ( which effects the opacity , and therefore the photosphere radius ) , or an indication that a different model , perhaps with a different csm profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , is required .",
    "other , similar , models for sn 2006gy have been suggested in previous works .",
    "@xcite suggested a steady wind model with estimated parameters @xmath184 cm , @xmath185 erg and @xmath186 , resulting in @xmath187 .",
    "these parameters are similar to the ones we adjusted .",
    "note that the large @xmath33 in this model results in a low blackbody temperature , as in our model a. @xcite considered a pulsational pair instability scenario , where a shell of @xmath188 was ejected to a radius of @xmath189 cm prior to the explosion . in this model",
    ", the photosphere radius remains relatively low ( this is due to the shell density profile and the large radii , which allow for a lower optical depth for the same csm mass ) but apparently not low enough to fit to the temperature measurement .",
    "@xcite try to explain sn 2006gy with a semi - analytical model based on the self - similar solutions of @xcite .",
    "however , their model has a low wind mass ( @xmath190 compared to @xmath191 ejecta mass ) , and a small csm radius ( @xmath192 cm , albeit with a different power law ) , which does not allow to recover the typical time scale in sn 2006gy .",
    "this discrepancy is noted by @xcite , who calculated the @xcite model numerically .",
    "@xcite suggest their own models for sn 2006gy , which include interaction with csm shells which are not due to steady winds , but rather a finite shell situated at a standoff distance form the star ( see their models d2 and f1 ) .",
    "the csm in these models extends to larger radii compared to our models ( @xmath193 cm ) , and contain less mass ( @xmath194 ) , which is compensated by a greater ejecta energy ( @xmath195erg ) .",
    "a more detailed comparison with these different models is beyond the scope of the current work , but we emphasize that our model a fits the light curve with at least the same quality as the other numerical models .",
    "one of the important aspects of @xcite is the comparison of effective and color temperatures ( their figure 8) .",
    "the significant difference between the two temperatures may be the reason why a simple blackbody approximation can not account for the observed temperature .",
    "the light curve data for sn 2005ap is taken from @xcite and the temperature is taken from @xcite .",
    "the measured luminosity and temperature imply a blackbody radius @xmath196 cm at peak luminosity .",
    "we choose a model with @xmath159 cm , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 erg .",
    "the calculated and observed light curves are plotted in figure [ fig : sn2005ap ] , and the ( calculated and observed ) temperatures are plotted in figure [ fig : sn2005ap_tmp ] .",
    "the fit of the model to the observations is marginal , and suffers from problems similar to the fit to sn 2006gy , but more mildly .",
    "the model is a bit too narrow and the calculated temperature is a bit too low .",
    "this implies some discrepancy between the wind radius imposed by the diffusion time scale and the blackbody radius imposed by the temperature and maximum luminosity .",
    "we note that that as in   [ sec : sn2010gx ] , the results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath57 , which is set to be smaller due to lack of hydrogen ( as indicated by * ? ? ?",
    "the discrepancy is again difficult to resolve by a different choice of parameters in the context of our model , but is more likely to be solved if we allow for corrections to the blackbody assumption and interpretation of observations . as in the case of sn 2006gy ,",
    "if we do not constrain @xmath33 by the implied blackbody radius ( because of the non equilibrium conditions for example ) , it is easy to fit the light curve better by increasing @xmath33 .",
    "in this work we considered a scenario for superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) based on shock breakout from the interaction of an ejecta from an exploding star and a massive envelope of circumstellar material , presumably emitted from the star prior to the explosion .",
    "we focused on a steady wind model for this csm , which dictates a @xmath199 density profile , and on massive winds , which have a total mass @xmath12 comparable with the ejected mass , @xmath11 . the latter assumption allows for shock breakout in which the entire ejecta participates , leading to an efficient conversion of the explosion energy to bolometric luminosity .",
    "this efficiency is required to explain the total energy observed in some slsne without resorting to high energy explosion mechanisms .",
    "our approach combines analytical limits and numerical hydro - diffusion calculations of the bolometric light curve .",
    "thus we improve upon previous works which considered a massive wind in the context of slsne with order of magnitude estimates @xcite .",
    "we note that the numerical calculations are absolutely necessary for producing reliable results in a @xmath200 scenario , since the analytical limits can not be applied . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical model includes only the fundamental physics of the problem , and so the principle trends are easily understood .",
    "our calculations are in agreement with more complex numerical models ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    specifically , we related the main features of the observed light curve to the parameters of the progenitor system - the star and the wind .",
    "as expected , we explicitly find that a large wind mass does allow to efficiently convert the energy of the explosion into a bolometric light curve , and that this efficiency naturally saturates when @xmath201 .",
    "however , we demonstrate that in this scenario the width of the light curve is strongly dependent on the cutoff distance of the wind , @xmath33 .",
    "quantitatively , we show that in order to recover a time scale of tens of days seen in the most energetic slsne , the wind outer radius must be of order a few @xmath3 cm .",
    "this result is consistent with the scenario of a steady mass loss of a few @xmath202 during the last 1000 years of the star s evolution @xcite .",
    "we applied our model to three slsne , namely sn 2010gx , sn 2006gy and sn 2005ap , which exhibited luminosities as high as several @xmath0 ergs with time scales of tens of days .",
    "we find that the light curves of these objects can be understood in terms of a supernova in a heavy wind scenario , where the progenitor star has a mass of @xmath203 and the wind mass is in the range @xmath204 .",
    "the efficient conversion of the ejecta kinetic energy to radiation in this scenario enables us to reproduce the light curves with energies in the standard range of @xmath205 erg , and , as mentioned above , with winds extending to radii of @xmath206 cm .",
    "assuming blackbody emission , our model reproduces the observations in sn 2010gx , but underestimates the temperatures measured in sn 2006gy , and to some extent in sn 2005ap as well .",
    "a similar trend was found in the other works mentioned above as well , and may be the result of a frequency dependent ( rather than constant ) opacity , differences between the effective and color temperatures , or both .",
    "we note that a separate subclass of slsne , where the peak luminosity is high but the time scales are shorter , such as sn 2008es @xcite may also be explainable with a steady wind model . in this case",
    "the wind mass must be significantly lower than the ejecta mass , so the initial wind optical depth may be small .",
    "we plan to investigate such systems numerically in future work .",
    "we do not explicitly compare our results with an alternative , but similar , scenario , where the ejecta interacts with a single shell , situated at some distance from the star , presumably a result of a short period of enhanced mass loss . clearly , a massive shell can be equally efficient in converting the explosion energy to radiation @xcite .",
    "differentiating between both scenarios must involve a wider parameter survey ( especially since in the shell model its position and density structure can be assumed independently ) , and probably some additional physics in the numerical model as well .    another issue which requires further work is a non - thermal component from shock breakout through the thick wind .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite pointed out that during breakout the shock is likely to become collisionless , hence creating a higher energy , non - thermal component in the spectrum .",
    "these works vary considerably concerning their estimates regarding the fraction of the total non - thermal energy eventually emitted from breakout , but obviously , if this fraction is sizable , there will be some impact on the bolometric light curve",
