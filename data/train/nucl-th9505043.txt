    "the effective chiral lagrangian including baryons , which corresponds to an expansion in increasing powers of derivatives of the meson fields and quark masses , has been successful in understanding many properties of the meson - baryon system at low energies @xcite .",
    "since the pion mass is small , properties of the pion - nucleon system are well described close to threshold .",
    "recently , the @xmath7 chiral lagrangian has also been applied to the @xmath8 system @xcite . in both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 cases ,",
    "the low energy ( s - wave ) interaction is relatively weak and the leading term of the lagrangian ( linear in the meson four - momentum @xmath11 ) is the main one . in this article",
    "we examine the @xmath12 system within the context of the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 cases , the @xmath12 system is a strongly interacting multichannel system with an s - wave resonance , the @xmath3 , just below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "terms of higher order in @xmath11 will therefore play a more pronounced role in the interaction .",
    "in fact the dynamical generation of such a resonance necessarily leads beyond any finite order expansion of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the motivation for nevertheless applying the effective chiral lagrangian to the @xmath13 system is two - fold : first , to explore whether it provides driving terms with sufficiently strong attraction to generate a resonance at the right energy ; secondly , to test the theory in the @xmath0 sector and to obtain information about the parameters of the lagrangian not accessible in the @xmath14 or @xmath10 interactions . at low energies ,",
    "the @xmath15 and proton can scatter into six different @xmath16 and pion - hyperon channels , and the data place constraints on the relative interaction strengths among the different channels . since each of the different terms of the chiral lagrangian has its own particular su(3 ) structure ,",
    "this six - channel system is a good testing ground for the theory and enables one to obtain estimates of the lagrangian parameters .",
    "the presence of the @xmath3 resonance requires that one needs to go to infinite order in a certain class of rescattering diagrams .",
    "thus to build up the resonance we are led to constructing a potential model to handle the calculation .",
    "a potential model was previously applied to the @xmath16 system @xcite , and the approximations necessarily involved in using this method are expected to be quite reasonable , since the resonance dominates the interaction . in order to connect the chiral lagrangian to the potential model approach ,",
    "we construct a meson - baryon potential which in the born approximation has the same s - wave scattering amplitude as the effective chiral lagrangian , up to order @xmath1 .",
    "two different forms of the potential , one local and one separable , are investigated .",
    "this potential is iterated in a lippmann - schwinger equation , and the free parameters of the lagrangian are adjusted to fit a wide variety of low - energy data of the kaon - baryon system .",
    "an additional constraint is placed on the parameters so that the isospin even @xmath9 s - wave scattering length is consistent with its experimental value .",
    "we find that parameters from lagrangian terms up to order @xmath1 are sufficient to fit the data .",
    "in particular , the observed properties of the @xmath3 resonance are reproduced remarkably well .",
    "furthermore as a consistency check , we calculate the @xmath17 s - wave phase shift ( strangeness @xmath18 sector ) from the parameters obtained in fitting the @xmath16 system .    in the second section",
    "we describe the effective chiral lagrangian and the potential model , and in the third section we discuss our results . in each section",
    "we consider interaction terms of order @xmath11 and then of order @xmath1 , where @xmath11 stands for the meson four - momentum . in the final section",
    "we discuss the limitations and some qualitative aspects of the calculation .",
    "the effective low - energy lagrangian density for interacting systems of pseudoscalar mesons and baryons can be written generally as @xcite    @xmath19    corresponding to increasing number of derivatives ( external momenta ) and quark masses .      in the relativistic formalism",

    "the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath7 axial vector couplings , whose accepted values are @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite , together with @xmath31 . through goldberger - treiman relations they determine the pseudovector meson baryon coupling strengths .",

    "the four - velocity @xmath35 permits fixing a particular reference frame which we choose to be the meson - baryon center of mass system .",
    "an observer in that frame is characterized by @xmath36 .",
    "this part of the interaction , eq.(5 ) is the current algebra , or weinberg - tomozawa , term @xcite .",
    "the tree approximation of this term agrees with the experimental values of the s - wave scattering length to within @xmath37 for @xmath14 and to within @xmath38 for the @xmath10 system . in the @xmath39 channel",
    "this weinberg - tomozawa term is repulsive .",
    "the lagrangian also applies to the @xmath40 interaction .",
    "here , the current algebra term produces an attractive interaction .",
    "the @xmath3 resonance just below the @xmath41 threshold could be resulting from this attractive term .",
    "we investigate this possibility in the next section .",
    "in addition to the order @xmath11 terms mentioned above , the tree graphs of the relativistic lagrangian @xmath42 give rise to s - wave meson - baryon amplitudes at order @xmath1 ( and higher ) . these order @xmath1 terms are relativistic ( @xmath43 ) corrections from the covariant derivative piece and the born graphs involving the axial coupling terms ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition to these order @xmath1 pieces , we have to consider the most general form of the chiral effective lagrangian @xmath44 .",
    "the complete relativistic version involving all terms allowed by chiral symmetry can be found in @xcite . in the heavy baryon formalism",
    "its form is simpler , and the relevant s - wave terms are @xcite :    @xmath45    where    @xmath46    the matrix @xmath47 is proportional to the quark mass matrix and has only diagonal elements ( see appendix i ) . using the gell - mann , oakes , renner relation in the isospin limit for the pseudoscalar mesons , the diagonal elements of @xmath47 are @xmath48 .",
    "the axial matrix operator @xmath49 is given by    @xmath50    all contributions of @xmath44 at tree level are of order @xmath1 .",
    "the next order @xmath51 involves loops .",
    "the amplitudes for all channel couplings up to order @xmath1 , which also include the relativistic corrections , are given in appendix ii .",
    "the constants in front of the various terms are not determined from chiral symmetry , but need to be determined from experiment .",
    "the first two , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , can be determined from the baryon mass splittings since to order @xmath1 :    @xmath54    and    @xmath55    one obtains @xmath56 gev@xmath57 and @xmath58 gev@xmath57 .",
    "data restricts the range for the constant @xmath59 , since it is related to the @xmath9 sigma term .",
    "to order @xmath1 we have :    @xmath60    and the strangeness content of the proton to this order is given by :    @xmath61    thus , @xmath59 can not be greater than @xmath62 gev@xmath57 since otherwise the strangeness content of the proton would be negative .",
    "we also did not allow @xmath59 to be less than @xmath63 gev@xmath57 , which keeps @xmath64 less than about @xmath65 mev @xcite .",
    "data from interactions among the meson - baryon octet ( i.e. the @xmath13 interaction ) gives information regarding the double - derivative parameters , the @xmath66-terms in eq.(6 ) .",
    "the notation in eq .",
    "6 was adopted since if @xmath47 is proportional to the unit matrix ( i.e. @xmath67 ) , terms with the same subscripts have the same relative su(3 ) strengths .",
    "the motivation for studying the @xmath13 system is to see how well the effective chiral lagrangian describes the experimental data in this strangeness sector , and to obtain estimates for the `` @xmath66 '' parameters of eq.(6 ) . since the interaction supposedly produces a resonance just below the @xmath4 threshold , a certain class of diagrams needs to be summed to infinite order to produce a pole at the appropriate energy .",
    "thus , the chiral perturbation expansion for the scattering amplitude is not feasible , and we adopt a potential model approach .",
    "we connect the two formalisms in the following way : _ the pseudo - potentials are constructed such that up to order @xmath1 they have , in the born approximation , the same s - wave scattering amplitude as the chiral lagrangian_. in the last section we discuss some of the limitations of using this potential approach .",
    "the above prescription for obtaining a potential from the chiral lagrangian gives a unique zero - range potential of the form :    @xmath68    where the @xmath69 and @xmath70 label the six meson - baryon channels + ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "here @xmath72 is the total center - of - mass energy of the system , @xmath73 is the mass of the baryon in channel @xmath69 , and @xmath74 is the reduced energy of channel @xmath69 in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "explicitly ,    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the mass and @xmath77 is the energy of the meson in channel @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath78 are determined directly from the effective chiral lagrangian and are given in appendix ii .",
    "the kinematic factor @xmath79 is needed to obtain the proper relativistic flux factor in the differential cross section . the differential cross section from initial channel @xmath70 to final channel @xmath69 in the born approximation",
    "is :    @xmath80    where we have used eq.(12 ) in the last step , and @xmath81 stands for the meson momentum in the center of mass frame .    in order to dynamically produce the @xmath3 resonance ,",
    "the potential must be iterated to infinite order . here",
    "we use a lippmann - schwinger equation . to obtain a finite result",
    ", a cut - off or inverse range scale , denoted by @xmath82 , needs to be introduced in the potential .",
    "we examine two ways of parameterizing the finite range of the potential while keeping the born term the same : a local potential and one separable in the incoming and outgoing relative momenta . for the local potential between channel",
    "i and j we use a yukawa form :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 . in our analysis , we found a satisfactory solution for the local potential using only a single common range @xmath85 mev for all channels .",
    "for the yukawa potential the parameter @xmath82 can be interpreted as an average `` effective mass '' that represents the spectrum of exchanged particles in the t - channel mediating the interaction .",
    "the value of @xmath82 found here for the @xmath86 channel is reminiscent of typical two - pion ranges .    for comparison",
    "we also examine a separable potential of the momentum space form :    @xmath87    where @xmath81 is the center - of - mass momentum for channel i. the potentials are inserted into a lippmann - schwinger equation . for the local potential , this equation is solved in coordinate space :    @xmath88    for the separable potential we use the lippmann - schwinger equation ( for the s - wave ) in momentum space :    @xmath89    which can then be solved analytically .",
    "the t - matrix resulting from this equation is related to the nonrelativistic scattering amplitude @xmath90 .",
    "the total s - wave cross section for the channel @xmath91 is thus given by    @xmath92    keeping only the born term and using a zero range potential , i.e. @xmath93 , this cross section becomes :    @xmath94    which agrees with the result of eq.(14 ) .    for our applications , the local potential is the more physical one , since it permits an interpretation in terms of t - channel exchange processes .",
    "for example , vector meson exchange has the same basic su(3 ) structure as the current algebra term .",
    "however , it is useful also to examine the separable potential for a qualitative analysis and to check for model dependencies .",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the results of our analysis and the values of the `` @xmath66 '' parameters turn out to be very similar for the two different potentials .",
    "hence the physics described here is not sensitive to the specific form of the potential .",
    "since the weinberg - tomozawa ( current algebra ) term is known to be the largest one in the s - wave @xmath9 interaction , it is instructive to examine how well the interaction due to this term alone reproduces the available data in the @xmath0 sector .",
    "so we start by examining the current algebra term by itself first , and then add terms involving order @xmath1 in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the potential for this term is obtained by setting all the `` @xmath95 '' and `` @xmath66 '' parameters to zero in @xmath78 and neglecting the relativistic corrections in eq.(2 ) .",
    "the only free parameters are the inverse ranges @xmath96 .",
    "first we investigate if the current algebra term alone will produce a resonance or quasi - bound state . to do this , we use a common range @xmath82 for all channels .",
    "the results are shown in table i , where we list the energy of the quasi - bound state formed for different parameters @xmath82 . as can be seen , if the range parameter of the interaction for the local potential is larger than 300 mev then a quasi - bound state is indeed formed below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "the range of the interaction is roughly @xmath97 fm . for the separable potential , the same resonance below the @xmath4 threshold",
    "is produced for a value of @xmath82 greater than 400 mev .",
    "thus , a potential derived from chiral dynamics with interaction ranges commensurate with the meson - baryon system _ necessarily produces a quasi - bound state or resonance below or near the @xmath4 threshold_.    how well does the current algebra piece predict the other low energy data ? first we consider the scattering data .",
    "we have performed a @xmath98 analysis on the low energy scattering data @xcite as follows : first a common range @xmath82 was picked , then the value of the decay constant @xmath99 was determined to produce a resonance at 1405 mev .",
    "then the total cross sections were calculated , compared with the available experimental data , and a chi - square per data point , @xmath100 , was determined .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 was varied until @xmath100 was minimized .",
    "note that since the energy is low , only the @xmath101 partial wave needs to be considered .",
    "the results are shown in table ii .",
    "we see that for both potentials , a fairly good fit , @xmath102 , to the scattering data is possible . for the local potential",
    ", the mimimum came out to be at @xmath103 mev , which almost coincides with the pseudoscalar meson decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the current algebra term alone , when iterated using a common off - shell range parameter , gives agreement with six scattering channels and produces an i=0 resonance at 1405 mev . for the separable potential ,",
    "a @xmath98 minimum was found at @xmath104 mev .    for the @xmath105 sector ,",
    "the un - iterated current algebra term gives zero for the @xmath86 and @xmath106 fm for the @xmath107 s - wave scattering length .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath86 scattering length is indeed very small . to obtain the experimental value of @xmath108 fm for the @xmath107 scattering length , range parameters @xmath109 mev for the local and @xmath110 mev for the separable potential",
    "were needed .    in examining the threshold branching ratios ,",
    "the situation is not so good for the current algebra term alone .",
    "the hadronic threshold branching ratios are @xcite :    @xmath111    they place tight constraints on the relative potential strengths of the @xmath12 system .",
    "two of the branching ratios are in fair agreement with experiment , however , the strangeness plus double charge exchange branching ratio @xmath112 is far off .",
    "experimentally , the channel @xmath113 is produced 2.4 times as often as @xmath114 in the decay at threshold .",
    "note that the current algebra piece in lowest order gives zero for the @xmath115 interaction . in terms of chiral power counting",
    "the numerator goes as @xmath116 and the denominator as @xmath1 , and the ratio @xmath112 is formally suppressed .",
    "experimentally this is not the case , which demonstrates the limits of using a chiral perturbation expansion for the low energy @xmath12 system .",
    "we let the ranges vary for each channel to see if it was possible to fit both the scattering data and the three threshold branching ratios .",
    "no fit was found .",
    "next we examine if it is possible to match the data by including the terms of order @xmath1 .",
    "one can not vary @xmath59 and the `` @xmath66 '' parameters arbitrarily to fit the @xmath12 data , since the chiral lagrangian applies to all meson - baryon interactions . for two s - wave scattering lengths ( @xmath117 and isospin - even @xmath9 ) the current algebra term gives zero and",
    "the leading term is order @xmath1 .",
    "experimentally , these scattering lengths are small : @xmath118 fm @xcite and @xmath119 fm @xcite . since @xmath59 and the `` @xmath66 '' parameters are the leading terms for these two scattering lengths , we restrict their values in the search to be compatible with the experimental results .",
    "the @xmath9 isospin - even and @xmath117 scattering lengths are given in appendix ii to order @xmath51 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "for the @xmath120 scattering length , the range in the potential can be adjusted to fit the experimental value of @xmath108 fm .",
    "the search was done as follows : first the nine parameters @xmath59 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and the range(s ) were chosen .",
    "then a value for @xmath99 was determined which produced a resonance at 1405 mev .",
    "the total @xmath98 for the scattering data to the six channels , the three threshold branching ratios , and the scattering lengths @xmath126 and @xmath127 was calculated . in order to have the pion decay constant @xmath99",
    "be near 93 mev , the term @xmath128 was added to the @xmath98 function .",
    "the nine parameters were varied until the @xmath98 was minimized .",
    "the search was carried out using minuit @xcite , and some parameters were restricted in the search .",
    "the range parameters @xmath82 were limited to vary between 300 and 900 mev .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 was allowed to vary between @xmath62 and @xmath63 gev@xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath129 less than @xmath65 mev and @xmath130 greater than zero .",
    "it is interesting that for the local potential all the best - fit parameters were within the ranges set .",
    "a value of @xmath131 gev@xmath57 corresponds to @xmath132 mev , which turns out to coincide with the empirical analysis @xcite .",
    "satisfactory fits were found for both the local and separable potentials using appropriate range parametrizations . for the separable potential ,",
    "the best fit was found using three different ranges for the @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath16 channels .",
    "for the local potential a good fit is obtained using only one common range for all channels .",
    "the values of the `` best fit '' parameters for the two cases are listed in table ii . in table",
    "iii we list the @xmath135 for the scattering data along with the values for the threshold branching ratios . in figs . 2 - 6 we plot the total cross sections to the various channels , as well as the @xmath136 mass spectrum for the two fits .",
    "the total @xmath98 can be slightly improved for the local potential by using three different ranges as in the separable case .",
    "however , the lagrangian parameters do not change significantly .",
    "thus , we focus our attention on the single range fit , since it reproduces the data well and has the least number of parameters .",
    "also , the preferred value @xmath137 mev lies between the mass of a vector meson and that of two pions .",
    "this value is in line with the physics of the process , since such t - channel exchanges are believed to dominate the interaction .",
    "as can be seen from table ii , the lagrangian parameters turn out to be very similar for both the local and separable potential fits .",
    "this is probably because the range of energies investigated here is small , and thus the results are not sensitive to the form of the potentials",
    ". if other potential forms were used , similar values for the lagrangian parameters would probably be obtained .",
    "thus , the most important parameters in the fit are `` @xmath59 '' and the `` @xmath66 s '' . to our knowledge , our results are the first estimates of the double - derivative `` @xmath66 '' parameters .",
    "although there are six lagrangian parameters , their freedom to vary is restricted .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is confined to stay between @xmath63 and @xmath62 gev @xmath57 as discussed above . requiring @xmath126 and @xmath127 to be near zero ,",
    "reduces the effective degrees of freedom to three .",
    "thus , a fit to the diversified data of the @xmath16 system with only one common range parameter ( for the local potential ) is remarkable .",
    "as can be seen table ii , the double - derivative `` @xmath66 '' parameters are mostly negative .",
    "the negative sign is needed to cancel the quark mass `` @xmath95 '' terms in @xmath126 and @xmath127 in order to obtain the near zero experimental values of these quantities ( see appendix ii ) .",
    "this same cancelation is also desirable in the @xmath16 system , since the iterated current algebra term by itself does a fairly good job at fitting the data .    for the @xmath10 system ,",
    "the @xmath86 scattering length was incorporated in the fit and is near zero .",
    "the scattering length remains essentially zero when the potential is iterated .",
    "the `` best fit '' parameters also apply to the @xmath10 interaction in the @xmath107 channel , where the experimental value of the scattering length is @xmath138 fm @xcite . for the local potential ,",
    "the @xmath107 potential is given by eq.(15 ) with the @xmath78 replaced by the @xmath139 from appendix ii .",
    "the born scattering length for the `` best fit '' parameters gives @xmath140 fm , and iteration of the potential reduces this value .",
    "thus by choosing an appropriate range for this channel , the scattering length can be made equal to the experimental result .",
    "a range parameter of @xmath141 mev reproduced the experimental value of @xmath142 fm .",
    "we note that this range also gives reasonable agreement with the energy dependence of the @xmath107 s - wave phase shift as shown in fig .",
    "we plot the s - wave phase shift as a function of kaon laboratory momentum for this fit by the solid line .",
    "the dots correspond to the phase shift taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have investigated if there were any other satisfactory fits to the data by using different starting points for the search .",
    "we also tried three different ranges with the local potential , and found one fit with @xmath143 mev for the @xmath16 channel , but with very similar values for the lagrangian parameters as in table ii . in fig .",
    "2 we plot the s - wave @xmath39 phase shift for this fit by the dashed line . in this case , @xmath144 mev , and the energy dependence agrees even better with martin s phases @xcite .",
    "the overall best fit used three ranges for the local potential and produced a @xmath145 for all the data , but again with similar values for the lagrangian parameters .",
    "we note that the parameters were fitted to the data using a potential model , and need to be interpreted in this context .",
    "we briefly comment on possible limitations of the potential model approach when comparing with a chiral perturbation expansion .    when iterating the potential in the lippmann - schwinger equation , four - dimensional loop integrals are not calculated in all completeness .",
    "the energy part of the integral is integrated out , producing a propagator appropriate for the three remaining dimensions .",
    "all multiple scatterings include only `` ladder '' graphs .",
    "crossed graphs are not included in our calculation in the iteration process , and the meson - meson interaction is neglected .",
    "this is expected to be a reasonable approximation , since the energies are low , the mass of the kaon is relatively large , and the resonance at @xmath146 mev dominates the @xmath12 interaction at low energies . the s - matrix we obtain in the potential model is unitary , and has a pole at the @xmath3 resonance . the born amplitudes respect crossing symmetry , but the full amplitudes can not be extended too far in energy away from the region investigated here , since neglecting crossed graphs in the iteration of the potential violates crossing symmetry .",
    "it is encouraging , however , that the s - wave @xmath147 scattering length and the energy dependence of the phase shift are reproduced reasonably well even though only the born amplitudes respect crossing symmetry .    in a systematic chiral perturbation expansion amplitudes",
    "are expanded in powers of meson energies .",
    "the terms up to order @xmath1 for s - wave scattering are given entirely in terms of the current algebra term , the `` @xmath95 '' and `` @xmath66 '' parameters and relativistic corrections to order @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath51 contribution is given by single loops involving just the current algebra term and higher order counter terms .",
    "however , using a potential model with a cut - off introduces an additional length scale .",
    "this is most easily seen by examining the separable potential for which an analytic solution exists . for a single",
    "channel separable potential , the scattering amplitude is given by :    @xmath148^{-1},\\ ] ]    and the scattering length is thus :    @xmath149^{-1 } .\\ ] ]    here @xmath150 includes both the current algebra term ( order @xmath11 ) and the tree level terms of order @xmath1 . by expanding the denominator , the next power of `` @xmath11 '' after",
    "@xmath1 is @xmath151 .",
    "thus , it is not possible to compare terms from the potential model used here with those of a chiral perturbation expansion beyond order @xmath1 .",
    "however , one can use the above equation to estimate how a chiral perturbation series might converge for the @xmath39 s - wave scattering amplitude .",
    "to order @xmath11 the scattering length is @xmath152 fm .",
    "using the `` best fit '' parameters of the separable potential , the @xmath1 terms contribute @xmath153 fm to the scattering length .",
    "thus @xmath154 fm .",
    "order @xmath51 and higher terms need to be large to bring the scattering length close to the experimental value . for",
    "the separable potential one can calculate the contribution of the once iterated current algebra piece , which in a chiral perterbation expansion is the @xmath51 term . to obtain @xmath155 fm , the experimental value , one needs @xmath156 mev , making the @xmath157 term equal to @xmath158 fm .",
    "thus , we see here that the once iterated current algebra term can be as large the order @xmath11 term .",
    "eq.(23 ) is instructive in comparing the difference between the @xmath18 and @xmath0 @xmath17 interactions .",
    "the current algebra terms have opposite sign , negative for @xmath147 and positive for @xmath4 . for the @xmath39 case ( @xmath159 ) the multiple scattering reduces the scattering length from the born result in accord with experiment .",
    "since @xmath150 is roughly twice the experimental value , a short range ( large @xmath82 ) is needed for the multiple scattering to produce a large enough correction .",
    "this short range is also desirable in obtaining the correct energy dependence of the s - wave phase shift , for which there is a small effective range . for the @xmath41 case ( @xmath159 ) ,",

    "the @xmath3 produced in the potential model derived here is a bound state in the @xmath16 ( @xmath86 ) channel and a resonance in the @xmath160 channel .",
    "it is instructive to verify this in terms of the @xmath16 and @xmath133 wave functions . in fig.3",
    "we plot these wave functions , taken at the energy corresponding to the peak of the @xmath133 mass spectrum , for the best - fit one parameter local potential ( i.e. with @xmath137 mev ) .",

    "historically there has been a disagreement between the scattering length extracted from the scattering data versus the @xmath4 1s atomic level shift . in our analysis",
    "as well , the real part has the opposite sign as the atomic level shift results . in figure 4",
    "we plot the real and imaginary part of the scattering amplitude near and below the @xmath4 threshold for both the local and separable potential .",
    "the structure below threshold is typical of a resonance .",
    "the @xmath4 scattering length we obtain is @xmath164 fm , and in the isospin limit setting @xmath165 and @xmath166 we get @xmath167 fm .",
    "the experimental data is still controversial @xcite , so we did not include it in our fits .",
    "it is important to obtain a reliable value for the level shift , since if further experimental analysis confirms earlier results , chiral dynamics will be in disagreement with the data .",
    "in general , more scattering data would also be useful in further testing the predictions based on chiral dynamics , since the experimental data for the scattering channels are quite old , and for some channels not very extensive .",
    "we have applied the effective chiral lagrangian to the strangeness @xmath0 sector of the @xmath12 interaction by constructing a pseudo - potential from the lagrangian , such that this potential used in the born approximation has the same s - wave scattering amplitude as the chiral lagrangian up to order @xmath1 .",
    "this potential model approach successfully produces the @xmath3 resonance just below the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "a number of lagrangian parameters were adjusted to fit the available low energy @xmath12 data , with constraints from the @xmath18 @xmath17 system and the isospin even @xmath9 scattering length .",
    "satisfactory results were found using both local and separable potential forms , and a good fit was obtained using only one common range parameter for all channels in the local potential .",
    "the lagrangian parameters turned out roughly the same for both potential forms used .",
    "to our knowledge the values obtained here are the first estimates of some of these parameters .",

    "channel one corresponds to the @xmath171 state , channel two to @xmath172 , channel three to @xmath114 , channel four to @xmath173 , channel five to @xmath41 , and channel six to the @xmath174 state .      where @xmath176 and @xmath177 denote the pion and kaon energy respectively in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "the pion and kaon masses are labeled as @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the quantities labeled @xmath180 and @xmath181 include the relativistic correction to the current algebra piece to order @xmath1 and are :          where the index @xmath82 ( or @xmath186 ) stands for pion or kaon .",
    "these terms arise from the born graphs involving the axial vector couplings which have an octet baryon exchanged in the `` s '' or `` u '' channel .",

    "note that @xmath188 .",
    "the @xmath189 terms in @xmath184 deserve some explanation .",
    "baryon exchange in the u - channel leads to logarithmic singularities in the partial wave amplitudes below threshold . in the @xmath9 case it gives rise to the so - called short nucleon cut @xcite extending from @xmath190 to @xmath191 . in the heavy mass limit ,",
    "both logarithmic branch points in the @xmath176-plane coalesce and give rise to a pole singularity .",
    "the presence of subthreshold singularities restricts the kinematic range for the potential approach to be applied . in this analysis",

    "in fact , when we neglected the s- and u- channel baryon exchange amplitudes entirely , we obtained a good fit to the data with similar values for @xmath59 and the `` @xmath66 '' parameters as in table ii .            where @xmath197 is the axial vector coupling constant .",
