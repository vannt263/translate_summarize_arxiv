    "the study of groups of galaxies as dynamical systems is interesting not only _ per se _ , but also because groups can be used to set constraints on cosmological models ( e.g. frenk 1990 ; weinberg & cole 1992 , zabludoff 1993 ; zabludoff & geller 1994 , nolthenius 1994 , 1997 ) and on models of galaxy formation ( frenk 1996 ; kaufmann 1997 ) .",
    "groups are also interesting sites where to look for interactions of galaxies with their environment , in order to obtain information on galaxy evolution processes ( postman & geller 1984 , allington - smith 1993 ) .",
    "group catalogs identified in redshift space are increasing both in number and size ( cfa2n , rpg ; ssrs2 , ramella 1998 ; perseus - pisces , trasarti battistoni 1998 ; lcrs , tucker 1997 ) . at the same time",
    ", cosmological n - body simulations are reaching the resolution required to allow replication of the observational techniques for the identification of groups .",
    "in particular , frederic ( 1995a , b ) uses n - body simulations to evaluate and compare the performances of commonly used group finding algorithms .    among the main properties of groups , the velocity dispersion is of particular interest .",
    "it is easy to measure and it is well suited for comparison with the predictions of cosmological n - body models ( frenk 1990 ; moore 1993 ; zabludoff 1993 ) .",
    "distributions of velocity dispersions of nearby groups are now well determined with rather small statistical uncertainties given the large size of the samples .",
    "ramella 1995 and ramella 1996 survey the redshifts of candidate faint members of a selection of nearby groups and find that the velocity dispersion of groups is stable against inclusion of fainter members .",
    "in other words , the velocity dispersion estimated on the basis of the fewer original bright members is a good indicator of the velocity dispersion obtained from a better sampling of the same group .",
    "in this paper we identify and analyze groups of galaxies in the recently completed esp survey ( vettolani 1997 ) .",
    "the esp group catalog is interesting because of its depth ( @xmath9 ) and because it samples a new independent region of the universe .",
    "esp is a nearly bi - dimensional survey ( the declination range is much smaller than the right ascension range ) , five times deeper than either cfa2 ( geller & huchra 1989 ) or ssrs2 ( da costa 1994 ) .",
    "the volume of the survey is @xmath10 at the sensitivity peak of the survey , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 at the effective depth of the sample , @xmath13 .",
    "even if the volume of esp is of the same order of magnitude of the volumes explored with the individual cfa2 , ssrs2 , and perseus - pisces samples , it intercepts a larger number of structures .",
    "in fact , the strip geometry is very efficient for the detection of large scale structures within redshift surveys ( de lapparent 1988 ) .",
    "in particular we determine the distribution of the velocity dispersions of groups and show that our result is reliable in spite of the particular geometry of the esp survey ( two rows of adjacent circular fields of radius @xmath14 arcmin , see figure 1 of vettolani 1997 ) .",
    "an important aspect that distinguishes the esp group catalog from the other shallower catalogs is that we have the spectra of all galaxies with measured redshift .",
    "it is already well known that emission line galaxies are rarer in rich clusters than in the field ( biviano 1997 ) .",
    "the relation between the fraction of emission line galaxies and the local density is a manifestation of the morphology ",
    "density relationship observed for clusters ( dressler 1980 ) , a useful tool in the study of galaxy evolution . with the esp catalog",
    "we explore the extent of the morphology density relationship in the intermediate range of densities that are typical of groups at a larger depth than in previous studies .",
    "we note that preliminary results of a search for groups in the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman 1996 ) have been presented by tucker ( 1997 ) .",
    "the properties of these groups , as distant as ours , are difficult to compare with those of our esp groups and with those of shallower surveys because lcrs a ) is a red band survey ( esp and shallower surveys are selected in the blue band ) , b ) it is not simply magnitude limited , and c ) it does not uniformly sample structures in redshift space . in particular",
    ", the different selection criteria could have a strong impact on the results concerning the morphology - density relation , the luminosity segregation , and the possible differences between the luminosity functions of member and non - member galaxies .",
    "in section 2 ) we briefly describe the data ; in section 3 ) we analyze the effect of the esp geometry on the estimate of the velocity dispersion of groups ; in section 4 ) we summarize the group identification procedure ; in section 5 ) we present the esp group catalog ; in section 6 ) we analyze properties of groups that are relevant to a characterization of the large scale structure ( lss ) ; in section 7 ) we analyze the properties of galaxies in groups and compare them to the properties of `` field '' galaxies ( _ i.e. _ galaxies that have not been assigned to groups ) and `` cluster '' galaxies ; in section 8) we identify esp counterparts of aco and/or edcc clusters ( lumsden 1992 ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section 9 ) .",
    "the eso slice project ( esp ) galaxy redshift survey is described in vettolani ( 1997 ) .",
    "the data of the full sample together with a detailed description of the instrumental set - up and of the data reduction can be found in vettolani ( 1998 ) .",
    "here we only briefly describe the survey .",
    "the esp survey extends over a strip of @xmath15 ( strip a ) , plus a nearby area of @xmath16 ( strip b ) , five degrees west of the main strip , in the south galactic pole region ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively ; @xmath2 ) .",
    "each of the two strips is covered with two rows of slightly overlapping circular fields of angular radius @xmath17 arcmin , the separation between the centers of neighboring circles being 30 arcmin .",
    "each field corresponds to the field of view of the multifiber spectrograph optopus at the 3.6 m eso telescope that was used to obtain almost all of the spectra ( the mefos spectrograph was used in the last esp run ) . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that the circular fields are tangent , with an angular radius of 15 arcmin : this simplification has no consequences on the galaxy sample .",
    "the total solid angle of the spectroscopic survey is 23.2 square degrees .",
    "the galaxy catalog consists of all ( candidate ) galaxies brighter than the limiting magnitude @xmath18 listed in the edinburgh ",
    "durham southern galaxy catalogue ( heydon  dumbleton et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range 3730  to 6050 , with an average pixel size of 4.5 .",
    "galaxy redshifts are measured by cross  correlating sky - subtracted spectra with a set of 8 template stars observed with the same instrumental set - up used to obtain the galaxy spectra . in this paper",
    "we use emission line redshifts only for galaxies with no reliable absorption line redshift .",
    "the median internal velocity error is of the order of @xmath19 . from a comparison of our 8 templates with three sao radial velocity standard stars we estimate that the zero  point error should be smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "the total number of confirmed galaxies with reliable redshift measurement is 3342 .",
    "the completeness of strip a and strip b are estimated to be 91% and 67% respectively .",
    "to all practical purposes , the projection of the esp survey on the sky consists of two rows of adjacent circular optopus fields of radius 15 arcmin and a separation of 30 arcmin between adjacent centers .",
    "the angular extent of groups and clusters at the typical depth of the survey ( @xmath21 ) are comparable , or even larger , than the size of the optopus fields .",
    "therefore , most systems falling into the survey s volume are only partially surveyed .",
    "the main effect of the `` mask '' of optopus fields is to hide a fraction of group members that lie within or close to the strip containing the mask ( the optopus fields cover 78% of the area of the `` un - masked '' strip ) .",
    "because of the hidden members , several poor groups may not appear at all in our catalog .",
    "on the contrary , our catalog might include parts of groups that are centered outside the esp strip .",
    "these problems notwithstanding , we expect to derive useful information on the most important physical parameter of groups , the velocity dispersion , .",
    "our estimate of the parent velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , is based upon the sample standard deviation @xmath23 . the sample standard deviation defined as",
    "@xmath24 is a nearly unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersion ( ledermann , 1984 ) , independent of the size @xmath25 of the sample .",
    "we make the standard assumptions that a ) barycentric velocities of members are not correlated with their real 3d positions within groups , and that b ) in each group the distribution of barycentric velocities is approximately gaussian . because the position on the sky of the optopus mask is not related to the positions of groups , its only effect is to reduce at random @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , using an unbiased estimate of the velocity dispersion , the mask has no effect on our determination of the average velocity dispersions of groups .",
    "the effect of the mask is to broaden the distribution of the sample standard deviations .",
    "the variance of the distribution of sample standard deviations varies with @xmath25 approximately as @xmath26 ( ledermann , 1984 ) .",
    "this distribution , proportional to the @xmath27 distribution , is skewed : even if the mean of the distribution is unbiased , is more frequently underestimated than overestimated .    while it is easy to predict the effect of the mask on the determination of the velocity dispersion of a single group , it is rather difficult to predict the effect of the mask on the observed distribution of velocity dispersions of a sample of groups with different `` true '' velocity dispersions and different number of members . in order to estimate qualitatively the effect of the mask on the shape of the distribution of velocity dispersions ,",
    "we perform a simple monte carlo simulation .",
    "we simulate a group by placing uniformly at random @xmath25 points within a circle of angular radius @xmath28 corresponding , at the redshift of the group , to the linear projected radius @xmath29 = 0.5 .",
    "this radius is the typical size of groups observed in shallow surveys ( e.g. rpg ) .",
    "we select the redshift of the group , @xmath30 , by random sampling the observed distribution of esp galaxy redshifts .    in order to start from reasonably realistic distributions , we set @xmath25 and the velocity dispersion , , by random sampling the relative histograms obtained from our esp catalog .",
    "we limit the range of to 3 @xmath31 @xmath32 18 and the range of to 0 @xmath32 @xmath31 1000 .",
    "we lay down at random the center of the simulated group within the region of the sky defined by extending 15 arcmin northward and southward the `` un - masked '' limits of the esp survey .",
    "we then assign to each of the points a barycentric velocity randomly sampled from a gaussian with dispersion centered on @xmath30 .",
    "we compute the velocity dispersion , @xmath33 , of the velocities .",
    "finally , we apply the mask and discard the points that fall outside the mask .",
    "we discard the whole group if there are fewer than 3 points left within the mask ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "if the group `` survives '' the mask , we compute the dispersion @xmath35 of the @xmath36 members . on average , 78% of the groups",
    "survive the mask ( this fraction corresponds to the ratio between the area covered by the mask and the area of the `` un - masked '' strip ) .",
    "the percentage of surviving groups depends on the exact limits of the region where we lay down at random groups and on the projected distribution of members within @xmath29 . for the purpose of the simulation ,",
    "the fraction of surviving groups is not critical .",
    "we repeat the procedure 100 times for @xmath37 = 231 simulated groups ( the number of groups identified within esp ) . at each run",
    "we compute the histograms n(@xmath36 ) and n(@xmath35 ) .    in figure 1",
    "we plot the input distribution n(@xmath25 ) thin line together with the average output distribution , @xmath38n(@xmath36)@xmath39 ",
    "thick line. errorbars represent @xmath40 one standard deviation derived in each bin from the distribution of the 100 histograms n(@xmath36 ) ; for clarity we omit the similar errorbars of n(@xmath25 .",
    "the factor @xmath41 normalizes the output distribution to the number of input groups .",
    "the two histograms in figure 1 are clearly very similar since n(@xmath25 ) is within one sigma from @xmath38n(@xmath36)@xmath39 for all values of .",
    "we point out here that the similarity between the input and output histograms does not mean that the surviving groups have not changed .",
    "in fact only about 63% of the triplets survive the mask while , for example , 88% of the groups with 5 members and 98% of those with 10 members `` survive '' the mask .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of our simple simulation for the velocity dispersion .",
    "the thin histogram is the input `` true '' distribution n(@xmath42 ) .",
    "the dotted histogram is the average `` observed '' distribution obtained without dropping galaxies that lie outside the optopus mask , n(@xmath33 ) .",
    "this is the distribution we would observe if the geometry of the survey would be a simple strip .",
    "the third histogram ( thick line ) is the average output distribution in presence of the optopus mask , @xmath38n(@xmath35)@xmath39 ( errorbars are @xmath40 one - sigma ) . the input distribution n(@xmath42 ) ,",
    "the distribution n(@xmath33 ) , and the distribution @xmath38n(@xmath35)@xmath39 are all within one - sigma from each other .",
    "in particular the two distributions we observe with and without optopus mask are undistinguishable ( at the 99.9% confidence level , according to the ks test ) .",
    "the low velocity dispersion bins are slightly more populated in the `` observed '' histograms because the estimate of the `` true '' is based on small .",
    "note that in the case of real observations , some groups in the lowest bin will be shifted again to the next higher bin because of measurement errors .",
    "our results do not change if we take into account the slight dependence of from observed within our esp catalog : also in this case the effect of the mask is negligible .    in conclusion , the simulation confirms our expectation that the optopus mask has no significant effect on the shape of the distribution of velocity dispersions .",
    "we identify groups with the so - called friend - of - friend algorithm ( fofa ; huchra & geller , 1982 ) as described in rpg .",
    "we implement here the cosmological corrections required by the depth of the sample ( @xmath43 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use h@xmath44 = 100 mpc@xmath45 and @xmath46 .    for each galaxy in the magnitude limited esp catalog",
    ", the fofa identifies all other galaxies with a projected comoving separation @xmath47 and a line - of - sight velocity difference    @xmath48    here @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the velocities of the two galaxies in the pair .",
    "all pairs linked by a common galaxy form a `` group '' .",
    "the two parameters , are scaled with distance in order to take into account the decrease of the magnitude range of the luminosity function sampled at increasing distance .",
    "the scaling is    @xmath51    and    @xmath52    where    @xmath53^{1/3 } , \\eqno ( 5)\\ ] ]    @xmath54    and @xmath55 is the absolute magnitude corresponding to @xmath56 at a fiducial velocity @xmath57 .",
    "we compute @xmath58 with the mattig ( 1958 ) expression , where @xmath59 . finally , @xmath60 is the @xmath61correction `` weighted '' with the expected morphological mix at each redshift as in zucca ( 1997 ) .",
    "the scaling is the same for both and and it is normalized at the fiducial velocity @xmath57 = 5000 , where 0 = @xmath62 ) and 0 = @xmath63 ) .",
    "in particular , a given value of 0 corresponds to a minimum number overdensity threshold for groups , .",
    "the luminosity function we use is the schechter parametrization with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 mpc@xmath67 computed for esp galaxies by zucca ( 1997 ) .",
    "we do not consider galaxies with velocities @xmath68 because the linear extension of the survey in the direction of the declination is smaller than the typical size of a group for @xmath695000 .",
    "we also limit the maximum depth of our group catalog to @xmath70 . beyond this limit",
    "the accessible part of the luminosity function becomes very small and the scaling of the fofa linking parameters excessively large .",
    "the main characteristics of the distribution of galaxies within the volume of the universe surveyed by esp ( vettolani 1997 ) are very similar to those observed within shallower , wider angle magnitude limited redshift surveys .",
    "for this reason we expect that the conclusions on the fine - tuning of fofa reached by ramella 1989 , frederic 1995a , and rpg will hold true also for esp . in particular , rpg show that within the cfan2 redshift survey the choice of the fofa parameters is not critical in a wide region of the parameter space around (= 80 , 0 = 350 ) . with our luminosity function and fiducial velocity , we obtain = 80 for 0 = 0.26 mpc , a value comparable to the 0 value used for cfan2 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that the same results of the exploration of the parameter space will hold also for the esp survey .",
    "in order to verify our expectation , we run fofa with the following five pairs of values of the linking parameters selected among those used by rpg : (= 80 , 0 = 250 ) , (= 80 , 0 = 350 ) , (= 80 , 0 = 600 ) , (= 60 , 0 = 350 ) , (= 100 , 0 = 350 ) . based on rpg ,",
    "these pairs of values are sufficient to give an indication of the stability of the group catalogs in the parameter space ( , ) .",
    "the number of groups in the five cases is n@xmath71 = 217 , 231 , 253 , 239 , and 217 respectively .",
    "we plot in figure 3 the observed distributions of the velocity dispersions of the five group catalogs .",
    "we compare the distribution obtained for (= 80 , 0 = 350 ) thick histogram in figure 3  with the other four distributions and find that the only significant difference ( 99.9 % level , according to the ks test ) occurs with the distribution obtained using the largest velocity link , 0 = 600 ( dotted histogram ) .",
    "this value of the velocity - link produces an excess of high velocity dispersion systems .",
    "frederic 1995a , ramella 1989 , and rpg argue that these high velocity dispersion systems are likely to include a significant number of interlopers ( galaxies with high barycentric velocity that are not physically related to the group in real space ) .    on the basis of the results of our tests ,",
    "we choose the catalog obtained with = 80 ( 0 = 0.26 ) and 0 = 350 as our final esp group catalog .",
    "this choice offers the advantage of a straightforward comparison between the properties of esp catalog and those of the cfa2n ( rpg ) , and ssrs2 ( ramella 1998 ) catalogs .",
    "we identify 231 groups within the redshift limits @xmath72 . these groups contain 1250 members , 40.5 % of the 3085 esp @xmath73 galaxies within the same range .    in table 1",
    "we present our group catalog . for each group",
    "we list the i d number ( column 1 ) , the number of members ( column 2 ) , the coordinates @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( columns 3 and 4 respectively ) , the mean radial velocity in corrected for virgo infall and galactic rotation ( column 5 ) , and the velocity dispersion ( column 6 ) .",
    "we compute the velocity dispersion following the prescription of ledermann ( 1984 ) for an unbiased estimator of the dispersion ( see previous section ) .",
    "we also take into account the cosmological expansion of the universe and the measurement errors according to the prescriptions of danese ( 1980 ) .",
    "the errors we associate to the redshifts are those output by the rvsao cross - correlation procedure multiplied by a factor 1.6 .",
    "this factor brings the cross - correlation error in rough agreement with the external error estimated from repeated observations ( vettolani 1998  here we do not distinguish between emission and absorption line redshifts ) .",
    "table 1 is available only in electronic form via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr ( 130.79.128.5 ) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/abstract.html .    in the case of 24 groups ,",
    "the correction of for the measurement errors leads to a negative value . in column 6 of table 1",
    "we give the error as an upper limit to for these groups .",
    "not all galaxies in the region of the sky covered by the esp survey have a measured redshift . of the original target list , 444 objects",
    "are not observed , and 207 objects have a noisy spectrum , insufficient for a reliable determination of the redshift . in table 1",
    "we give , for each group , the ratio of these objects to the number of members ( column 7 ) . in computing these rates ,",
    "we assign to each group the objects without redshift whose ( @xmath7 , @xmath76 ) coordinates fall within the angular region defined by the union of the circular regions obtained by projecting on the sky circles of linear radius @xmath77 centered on all group members .",
    "there are groups that are separated along the line - of - sight but that overlap once projected on the sky .",
    "if an object without redshift lies within the overlap region , we assign the object to both groups .",
    "there are 67 groups that do not contain any object of the photometric catalog without measured redshift . on the other hand , in the case of 51 groups the number of objects without redshift equals , or exceeds , the number of members .",
    "these groups are mostly triplets and quadruplets . only 14 out of the 51 ( possibly ) highly incomplete groups have @xmath78 5 .",
    "most of these groups are located in the relatively small region b of the redshift survey ( vettolani 1998 ) , which is the least complete ( completeness level = 71% ) .",
    "finally , we estimate that only 8 out of 231 groups are entirely contained within one optopus field . by `` entirely contained '' we mean that none of the circles of projected linear radius @xmath79 centered on the member galaxies crosses the edges of the optopus fields .",
    "in this section we discuss properties of esp groups that can be used to characterize the lss and that set useful constraints to the predictions of cosmological n - body models .",
    "the first `` global '' property of groups we consider is the ratio , @xmath80 , of their number to the number of non - member galaxies within the survey . for esp",
    "we have @xmath81 = 0.13 @xmath40 0.01 , for cfa2n rpg find @xmath82 = 0.13 @xmath40 0.01 , for ssrs2 ramella 1998 find @xmath83 = 0.12 @xmath40 0.01 .",
    "clearly the proportion of groups among galaxies is the same in all three independent volumes of the universe surveyed with esp , cfa2n and ssrs2 . because cfa2n and ssrs2 mostly sample only one large structure while esp intercepts several large structures , our result means that the clustering of galaxies in groups within the large scale structure is homogeneous on scales smaller than those of the structures themselves .",
    "we point out that , on the basis of our simple simulation , we do not expect the optopus mask to affect the determination of @xmath80 .",
    "we now consider the ratio of member to non - member galaxies , @xmath84 . within esp",
    "we have @xmath85 = 0.68 @xmath40 0.02 ; within cfan and ssrs2 , the values of the ratio are @xmath86 = 0.81 @xmath40 0.02 and @xmath87 = 0.67 @xmath40 0.02 respectively . quoted uncertainties are one poissonian standard deviation . according to the poissonian uncertainties , @xmath85 and @xmath87",
    "are undistinguishable .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is significantly different from the other two ratios .",
    "however , the real uncertainty in the ratio of members to non - members is higher than the poissonian estimate because the fluctuations in the number of members is dominated by the fluctuations in the smaller number of groups .",
    "moreover , the total number of members is strongly influenced by few very rich systems .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to eliminate two clusters , virgo and coma , from cfa2n in order to reduce the value of @xmath86 to @xmath86 = 0.70 @xmath40 0.02 , in close agreement with the ratio observed within esp and ssrs2 .    in conclusion , groups are a remarkably stable property of the large - scale distribution of galaxies . once the richest clusters are excluded , the abundances of groups and of members relative to that of non - member or``field '' galaxies are constant over several large and independent regions of the universe .",
    "we plot in the top panel of figure 4 the cone diagram ( @xmath7 vs @xmath88 ) for the 3085 esp galaxies within 5000 @xmath89 60000 . in the bottom panel of figure 4",
    "we plot the cone diagram of the 231 esp groups .",
    "figures 4 shows that groups trace very well the galaxy distribution , as they do in shallower surveys ( @xmath90 12000 ) .",
    "note that in figure 4 we project adjacent beams , not a strip of constant thickness .",
    "the topology of the galaxy distribution in redshift space has already been described by vettolani ( 1997 ) and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the most striking features are the voids of sizes @xmath91 50  and the two density peaks at @xmath92 18000 and @xmath93 30000 .",
    "these features are also the main features of the group distribution .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the redshift distributions of groups ( thick histogram ) and galaxies ( thin galaxies ) , divided by the total number of groups and by the total number of galaxies , respectively . in figure 6",
    "we plot number densities of galaxies in redshift bins .",
    "number densities are computed using the @xmath94 estimator of davis & huchra ( 1982 ) : all the details about the density estimates are given in zucca 1997 .",
    "we vary the size of the redshift bins in order to keep constant the number of galaxies expected in each bin based on the selection function .",
    "the top panel is for member galaxies , the middle panel is for isolated and binary galaxies , and the bottom panel is for all esp galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines represent the @xmath40 one sigma corridor around the mean galaxy density .",
    "it is clear from figure 5 that the redshift distributions of groups and galaxies are undistinguishable ( 98 % confidence level ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the number density in redshift bins of members and all galaxies are highly correlated ( figure 6a and 6c ) .",
    "more interestingly , the number density distribution of non - member galaxies is also correlated with the number density distribution of all galaxies ( figure 6b and 6c ) . in particular , the two density peaks at @xmath93 18000 and @xmath93 30000 of the number density distribution of all galaxies are also identifiable in the number density distribution of non - member galaxies , even if with a lower contrast .    we know from the previous section that groups are a very stable global property of the galaxy distribution within the volume of the esp and within other shallower surveys . here",
    "we show that a tight relation between non - member galaxies and groups exists even on smaller scales .",
    "our result is particularly interesting in view of the depth of the esp survey and of the number of large structures intercepted along the line - of - sight .",
    "we now discuss the velocity dispersions of esp groups . according to our simulation in section 2 , the effect on the velocity dispersions of the optopus mask",
    "is statistically negligible .",
    "the median velocity dispersion of all groups is @xmath4 = 194 ( 106,339 ) .",
    "the numbers in parenthesis are the 1st and 3rd quartiles of the distribution .",
    "poor groups with @xmath38 5 have a median velocity dispersion @xmath95=145 ( 65,254 ) , richer groups have @xmath96=272 ( 178,399 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the median velocity dispersions of cfa2n and ssrs2 are @xmath97 = 198 ( 88,368 ) and @xmath98 = 171 ( 90,289 ) .",
    "we take the values of the velocity dispersions for the cfa2 and ssrs2 groups from ramella ( 1997,1998 ) . in order to compare these velocity dispersions with ours ,",
    "we correct them for a fixed error of 50 ( corresponding to an rvsao error of @xmath91 35 ) and multiply them by @xmath99 .",
    "we note that , because of the optopus mask , the comparison of the velocity dispersions of `` rich '' and `` poor '' groups within esp with those of similar systems within cfa2n and ssrs2 is not meaningful",
    ". a fraction of esp `` poor '' groups may actually be part of `` rich '' groups .    in figure 7 we plot ( thick histogram ) the distribution of the velocity dispersions , @xmath100 ,",
    "normalized to the total number of groups .",

    "it is interesting to point out that @xmath102 and @xmath103 do differ significantly ( 97% level ) , @xmath102 being richer of high velocity dispersion systems ( marzke , 1995 ) .",

    "one interesting question is whether the environment of a galaxy has a statistical influence on the presence of detectable emission lines in the galaxy spectrum .",

    "these `` pseudo - groups '' dilute the properties of real bound triplets and quadruplets with `` field '' galaxies , artificially increasing the value of @xmath114 .",
    "this effect , in our survey , is partially counter - balanced by the triplets and quadruplets that are actually part of richer systems cut by the optopus mask . considering that rich systems are significantly rarer than triplets and quadruplets",
    ", we estimate that the value of @xmath114 we measure for triplets and quadruplets should be considered an upper limit .",
    "our catalog also includes esp counterparts of 17 clusters listed in at least one of the aco , acos ( abell 1989 ) or edcc ( lumsden 1992 ) catalogs ( section 8 , table 3 ) .",
    "for these clusters @xmath118 = 0.25 ( 63 out of 256 galaxies ) .",
    "the number of members of these systems is not a direct measure of their richness because of the apparent magnitude limit of the catalog and because of the optopus mask .",
    "however , because they include all the richest systems in our catalog and because they are counterparts of 2-d clusters , it is resonable to assume that they are intrinsically rich .",
    "we remember here that biviano ( 1997 ) find @xmath114 = 0.21 for their sample of enacs clusters.the fact that for esp counterparts of clusters we find a lower value of @xmath114 than for the other rich groups ( @xmath119 = 0.36 without clusters ) , further supports the existence of a morphology - density relation over the whole range of densities from clusters to the `` field '' .    many systems of our catalog are not completely surveyed , therefore the relationship between @xmath114 and the density of the environment we find can only be considered qualitative",
    ". however , while incompleteness certainly increases the variance around the mean result , we do not expect severe systematic biases . in order to verify that incompleteness does not affect our results",
    ", we consider the subsample of 67 groups that contain no esp objects without measured redshift .",
    "we obtain for this subsample the same relationship between group richness and fraction of emission line galaxies we find for the whole catalog .      within esp",
    "we identify 12 seyfert 1 galaxies and 9 seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we identify type 1 seyferts visually on the basis of the presence of broad ( fwhm of a few @xmath120  km  s@xmath45 ) components in the permitted lines .",
    "our list is complete with the possible exception of objects with weak broad lines which are hidden in the noise .",
    "the identification of type 2 seyferts is not straightforward , because it is based on line ratios and usually requires measurements of emission lines which fall outside our spectral range : only the f([o  iii]@xmath1215007)/f(h@xmath122 ) ratio is available from our spectra , and it is therefore impossible to draw a complete diagnostic diagram ( baldwin 1981 , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) . we classify tentatively as type 2 seyferts all emission line galaxies with @xmath123$\\lambda$5007)}/\\hbox{f(h$\\beta$)})\\ge 0.7 $ ] : this threshold cuts out almost all non - active emission line galaxies , but also many narrow - line agn with a medium to low degree of ionization .",
    "thus the list of possible seyfert 2 galaxies is almost free of contamination , but should by no means be considered complete .",
    "the origin of the seyfert phenomenon could be related to the interaction with close companions ( balick & heckman 1982 , petrosian 1982 , dahari 1984 , mackenty 1989 ) , or to a dense environment ( kollatschny & fricke 1989 , de robertis 1998 ) .",
    "observational evidence is , however , far from conclusive .",
    "for example , seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies have been found to have an excess of ( possibly ) physical companions compared to other spiral galaxies by rafanelli ( 1995 ) .",
    "laurikainen & salo ( 1995 ) agree with rafanelli ( 1995 ) about seyfert 2 galaxies , but reach the opposite conclusion about seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "in our case , 7 ( 33% ) out of 21 seyferts are group members . for comparison , 460 ( 34% )",
    "emission line galaxies ( not including seyfert galaxies ) are group members and 879 are either isolated or binaries .",
    "clearly , within the limits of our relatively poor statistics , we find that seyfert galaxies do not prefer a different environment than that of the other emission line galaxies .    in order to test the dependence of the seyfert phenomenon on the interaction of galaxies with close companions rather than with the general environment , we compute for all seyferts and emission line galaxies the projected linear distance to their nearest neighbor , the @xmath124-distance .",
    "we limit the search of companions to galaxies that are closer than 3000 along the line of sight .",
    "we find that the distribution of @xmath124-distances of the sample of seyfert galaxies is not significantly different from that of all emission line galaxies .",
    "we also consider the frequency of companions at projected linear distances @xmath125 mpc .",
    "we have 7 seyfert galaxies with such a close companion ( 33% ) and 315 ( 23% ) emission lines galaxies .",
    "one of the 7 seyferts is a member of a binary systems , the remaining six seyferts are members of groups . even if , taken at face value , the higher frequency of close companions observed among seyfert galaxies supports a causal connection between gravitational interaction and the seyfert phenomenon , these frequencies are not significantly different .",
    "we note that members of close angular pairs ( @xmath126 arcsec ) in the original target list for esp , are more frequently missing from the redshift survey than other objects ( vettolani 1998 ) .",
    "this bias , due to optopus mechanical constraints , could hide a possible excess of physical companions of seyfert galaxies .    in order to estimate",
    "how strongly our result could be affected by this observational bias , we identify the nearest neighbors of seyfert and emission line galaxies from a list including both galaxies with redshift and objects that have not been observed .",
    "when we compute projected linear distances to objects that have not been observed , we assume that they are at the same redshift of their candidate companion galaxy .",
    "as before , we do not find significant differences between the new @xmath124-distributions of seyferts and .",
    "this result demonstrates that the higher average incompleteness of close angular pairs does not affect our main conclusions : a ) seyfert galaxies within esp are found as frequently within groups as other emission line galaxies , b ) seyfert galaxies show a small but not significant excess of close physical companions relative to the other emission line galaxies .",
    "we point out again that the sample of seyferts is rather small and the statistical uncertainties correspondingly large .",

    "we conclude that luminosity segregation is at work in the esp survey : galaxies in the dense environment of groups are , on average , brighter than `` field '' galaxies .",
    "galaxies in groups are also less likely to have detectable emission lines in their spectra . in fact , we find a gradual decrease of the fraction of emission line galaxies among members of systems of increasing richness : the morphology - density relation clearly extends over the whole range of densities from groups to clusters .    as a final note",
    ", we identify 12 seyfert 1 galaxies and 9 seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we find that : a ) seyfert galaxies within esp are members of groups as frequently as other emission line galaxies , and b ) seyfert galaxies show a small but not significant excess of close physical companions relative to the other emission line galaxies .",
    "we point out again that the sample of seyferts is rather small and the statistical uncertainties correspondingly large .",
