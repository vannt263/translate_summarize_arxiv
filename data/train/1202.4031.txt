    "in the near future advanced gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors , like advanced ligo ( aligo)@xcite , advanced virgo ( avirgo)@xcite and the japanese kagra  @xcite will be operative , allowing us to regularly observe gravitational wave signals . nowadays there is a growing awareness that coincident observations of gw signals and electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts will play a crucial role in the future of gw astronomy allowing us to distinguish between the cases of environmental rather than astrophysical origins of events in the data with a relatively low signal .",
    "such observations will also be very important for astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "as an example , information regarding the supernova engine could be obtained by gw signals from core - collapse supernovae , gw signals coincident with gamma - ray bursts could help in determining the nature of the progenitor , and signals from a binary coalescence allow us to measure independently the distance and redshift to the source @xcite .",
    "this possibility will help us to determine the hubble parameter to within a few percent @xcite .    because the major part of electromagnetic observatories are intrinsically directional , a possible approach to perform multi - messenger observations is to localize the position of the source from the gravitational wave observations as quickly and accurately as possible to use electromagnetic observatories to follow up the event",
    ". then the first goal of gw astronomy would be to extract the sky location from the gravitational wave signal with enough accuracy . however , conversely to electromagnetic telescope , gravitational wave detectors are sensitive to most of the sky and it is not possible to obtain directional information of a short duration gw source from a single gw detector . indeed",
    "the location of a gw signal is primarily obtained using triangulation methods based on the observed time delays of the signal at different detectors and , for this reason , a network of two or more detectors is crucial for multi - messenger astronomy . with the new era of network with three or more advanced detectors a better localization capability will be surely achieved .",
    "for example , a challenging project to follow up gravitational wave sources from initial gw detectors using electromagnetic telescopes is already underway @xcite .",
    "localizing the gw sources with a good accuracy is not enough to perform multi - messenger observations , it must be done as rapidly as possible .",
    "fortunately , the improvement of sensitivity in advanced detectors allow some gw signals from inspiral binaries to stay in the aligo sensitive band for several minutes , giving the possibility of an early detection .    regarding em detection , a great number of electromagnetic observatories with a a field of view ( fov ) of around ten  square degree like pan starrs , palomar transient factory , lofar , skymapper and many others ( see @xcite for an overview ) are being specifically designed for transient phenomena .",
    "obviously a good estimate of localization accuracy in the case of early detected gw signals will help us to understand the feasibility of the future follow - up searches .    in this work",
    "we examine the ability of gravitational wave detectors to detect and localize transient signals _ before _ the coalescence .",
    "we perform a monte carlo simulation of sources distributed uniformly in space for two different mass scenarios with the ligo - virgo ( lv ) and ligo - virgo - kagra ( lvk ) detector network .",
    "we compute the probabilities to detect a merger prior to coalescence , and the associated sky area .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : sources ] the source population is described for this investigation , and section  [ sec : detection ] describes how we calculate the snr values of the simulated sources and how to obtain the sky area .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] will summarize the results which are discussed in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this work we will consider non spinning inspiral waveforms",
    ". only the inspiral part of the waveform is used , which ends at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) with frequency @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the speed of light , @xmath3 is the gravitational constant and @xmath4 is the total mass of the merger system .",
    "the frequency evolution of the waveform can be written as  @xcite    @xmath5    where    @xmath6    and @xmath7 is the symmetric mass ratio .",
    "( [ eq : ft])-([eq : theta ] ) can be used to find the frequency of the system as a function of time .",
    "a measured signal @xmath8 can be written as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the + and @xmath12 polarization of the signal from the source , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the antenna response factors , which depend on the relative orientation between the location of the binary to the antenna  @xcite .",
    "as these factors depend on the location of the source relative to the detector , they are time dependent . even for a low - mass binary system and a detector threshold of 10  hz",
    ", the time the signal stays in the sensitive band of a detector is well below an hour .",
    "as most of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is accumulated close to coalescence , the effects of earth rotation can be neglected .",
    "we consider two populations of sources , one consisting of double neutron stars ( ns  ns ) with masses of 1.4@xmath15 each , and one consisting of a neutron star with a black hole ( ns  bh ) , with masses of 1.4@xmath15 and 10@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "for the advanced detectors we assume two lower cutoff frequencies , one at @xmath16  hz and a more optimistic at @xmath17  hz .",
    "systems consisting of two black holes are not considered in this work , as the signal would coalesce at much smaller frequencies and the time spend in the sensitive detection band would be very short . furthermore , it is unlikely that such systems would produce bright electromagnetic counterparts .",
    "the merger rate is assumed to follow the stellar birth rate in spiral galaxies , which can be determined by blue galaxy luminosities  @xcite .",
    "however , there is reason to believe that the blue luminosity alone is not a good tracer of the merger rate , since a significant delay between the formation of the compact objects and their coalescence is expected .",
    "therefore we assume a substantial fraction of merger to take place in old elliptical galaxies @xcite . since the range to which advanced detectors are sensitive is hundreds of mpc , it is safe to assume a spatially uniform distribution of merger sources .",
    "to find a signal in the data , we use standard matched filter algorithms  @xcite . the snr of the signal is    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the complex conjugate of @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the power spectral density ( psd ) function of the detector .",
    "the anticipated noise curves for advanced ligo @xcite and advanced virgo  @xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "[ powers ] . as the japanese kamioka gravitational wave detector ( kagra )",
    "might also be operational later in this decade , it is important to include this detector in this investigation .",

    "power spectrum for advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra . ]    the central idea of this work is to estimate the accumulated snr of a gw source before the coalescence of the system at the isco frequency .",
    "this is done by changing the upper limit on the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : snr0 ] )    @xmath26    and then using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft ] ) to determine the maximum frequency @xmath27 as a function of time .",
    "the snr can be expressed as  @xcite    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    represents the response of an antenna in the direction of the source , @xmath30 being the angle between the axis of orbital angular momentum of the binary and the line of sight to earth .",

    "the network antenna power pattern describes the network relative sensitivity in different directions .",
    "crosses represent 10000 detected sources ]     over the sky for a four - detector network , consisting of the two aligo detectors , avirgo and the japanese kagra detector .",
    "the network antenna power pattern describes the network relative sensitivity in different directions .",
    "crosses represent 10000 detected sources . ]",
    "we now examine two different detector networks .",
    "the first network is made up of advanced ligo and advanced virgo ( lv ) , while the second network includes the japanese kagra detector ( lvk ) .",
    "the expected psd for advanced ligo , advanced virgo and kagra is used to calculate the estimated snr of a source .",
    "a signal is considered to be _ detected _ by the network , if the recovered snr exceeds a threshold of 7 in each detector of the network  @xcite .",
    "although a reasonable detection of a signal can be made with two detectors alone , useful triangulation can only be done with three or more detector sites in the network .",
    "the response of the three - detector network to sources in the sky is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : response - network ] .",
    "this plot shows the response of a given position above earth to the lv network .",
    "each cross in this figure represents a source in the sky that is being detected by the simulation , i.e. for which the recovered snr is at least 7 in each detector .",
    "[ fig : response - network4 ] shows the same result for the lvk network .",
    "the colorscale shows the network antenna power pattern @xmath31  @xcite , where @xmath32 goes over each detector .",
    "this is a generalization of the antenna power pattern for a network of detectors .",
    "it describes the relative sensitivity of the network in different directions .     and signal bandwidth @xmath33 as a function of time prior to merger .",
    "although a large fraction of the snr is accumulated well before the coalescence , the bandwidth increases significantly at later times .",
    "the signal of a ns ",
    "ns binary enters the sensitive band at 52 seconds prior to coalescence ( for a 30  hz lower frequency cutoff ) , while it is 12 seconds for a ns  bh signal . ]",
    "given a list of detected sources , it is now possible to estimate the accuracy of localization for each source . for the purposes of this work",
    ", we assume the localization is achieved entirely by triangulation between the detectors although the individual amplitudes of the signal provide additional information at the @xmath010% level  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the observed time of coalescence @xmath34 depends on the snr of the signal and the bandwidth @xmath35 of the detector s response .",
    "an approximation of this relationship can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath36    the timing accuracy is inversely proportional to the snr @xmath37 and the effective bandwidth @xmath38 of the source .    the approximations used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ accuracy ] ) break down at low snr , where second order effects become important . for a single detector snr threshold of 7",
    ", this approximation differs from the exact calculation by @xmath010% , which is within the accuracy of this work ( see right panel of fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "there were several analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite attempts to obtain a relation between time accuracy and the sky area .",
    "we will follow the analytic way laid out in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain an approximate area given the observation of a binary signal .",
    "we approximate the area at a given confidence level cl as    @xmath39/\\cos{\\theta}\\;,\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the errors associated with the eigen - directions of the matrix describing the location accuracy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , and @xmath42 is the angle between the normal of the plane spanned by the three detectors and the direction to the source .",
    "since the two ligo detectors have comparable sensitivity and the light - travel time from each ligo site to virgo is about the same ( 27 ms ) , it is possible to simplify the analytical sky location expression of ref .",
    "@xcite by taking the timing accuracy @xmath43 of the two ligo detectors to be identical , but allowing the virgo timing @xmath44 to differ .",
    "using a median angle as @xmath45 , the @xmath46 confidence level sky area @xmath47 is    @xmath48    note , that with a network composed of three detectors , the sky area is degenerate since such a network can not discriminate between a location above or below the plane spanned by the detectors .    since the error on the arrival time of a signal can be determined for each detector by using the bandwidth , it is important to note the properties of bandwidth before the coalescence .",
    "the dependence of the bandwidth and the snr prior to coalescence is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr_band ] .",
    "although the snr rises reasonably fast before the time of the merger , the bandwidth stays at very small values even very close to the merger because of the steep rise of the seismic wall in the power spectrum of the advanced detectors at lower frequencies ( see fig .",
    "[ powers ] ) .",
    "the approximation described in the previous section to obtain the sky area in the case of a three detector network can not be applied to networks with four or more detectors .",
    "thus a different approach must be taken when dealing with a network with more detectors . in that approach",
    ", the whole sky is tiled into equidistant sky points , and the expected time delay between each detectors @xmath49 is calculated for each point @xmath50 .",
    "the time residual for each detector combination is    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the observed light - travel time and @xmath53 is the error on the expected timing accuracy given as @xmath54 for detectors @xmath47 and @xmath55 . by computing the residual sum of squares over each detector combination _ combo _",
    ",    @xmath56    a probability can be assigned to each sky point @xmath50 :    @xmath57    after normalization of this quantities , all sky areas corresponding to the sky points are summed until the desired confidence level is reached . the resulting area @xmath58 is the sky area where the source is located at the given confidence level .",
    "this method is described in more detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : snr_band ] shows the evolution of the accumulated snr and frequency bandwidth over the course of the inspiral for the ns ",
    "ns and the ns  bh case . in the case of a ns ",
    "bh binary , the snr is accumulated much closer to coalescence compared to a ns ",
    "ns binary ( see table  i ) . since the gravitational wave signal from a ns ",
    "bh binary has smaller frequencies close to coalescence than a ns ",
    "ns binary , these systems reach the sensitive spectral part of a detector later , resulting in slower accumulation of snr . another interesting fact is the moment in which s signal enters the detector band .",
    "a signal from a ns ",
    "ns binary enters the sensitive band about 52 seconds prior coalescence , while it is only 12 seconds for a ns  bh system , given a frequency threshold of 30  hz . if the frequency threshold is at 10  hz , the ns  bh enters the detector band 215 seconds before coalescence .",

    "the work presented above shows that inspiral signals from the merger of two compact objects can be detected and localized _ before _ its coalescence .",
    "although the majority of snr is accumulated in the last moments before coalescence , an early detection and localization could become very likely with advanced detectors .",
    "two gw detector networks have been considered , one consisting of the two aligo and the avirgo detectors , and one network with the japanese kagra in addition .",

    "ns are detectable at @xmath010 seconds prior to coalescence , while this number becomes @xmath00.6% for ns ",
    "bh sources . as the expected number of coalescences detectable with advanced ligo / virgo is around 50 per year for ns ",
    "ns binaries , it might be possible to detect a few of such sources at about 10 seconds before the coalescence .    having made a detection , the sky area must be computed from the observed signal . if the signal is observed with the 3-detector network , the sky areas are typically hundreds of square - degrees , which makes it very unlikely to have an array of telescopes pointed in time to the correct direction .",
    "however , when including kagra the prospects of early detection and location become much more likely . as kagra introduces a very long additional baseline to the network , avoids the ambiguity of a 3-detector network , and provides additional information to determine the sky area , it seems possible a single 10 square - degree telescope is enough to observe the sky area around the coalescence .",
    "the question arises if there is enough time to process the gw data , and to send a notification to participating telescopes . with data - processing tools currently developed for advanced ligo / virgo , the data - analysis time",
    "can be reduced to virtually zero time .",
    "the time required to send the data between the detector sites and to the telescopes can also assumed to be sufficiently small .",
    "the most time consuming step seem to be the telescope pointing itself , but current telescopes are able to accomplish the pointing within a few seconds . finally , optical observations during the coalescence of two compact objects seems possible .",
    "even if a coincident gw / optical observation is possible only in a very few cases per year , this opens incredible scientific possibilities .",
    "it may become possible to directly test the connection of binary mergers with gamma - ray bursts , and to constrain models of their central engines .",
    "grb outflow models can be tested , the geometry of the outflow , and tests of lorentz invariance and tests of general relativity in the strong field regime become possible .",
