    "the focus is on specific details of , and relationships between , the various encodings of triangulations : ( i ) we discuss the efficiency of the binary encoding , and derive the minimum lattice size necessary to encode all triangulations with at most to @xmath72 forks distributed over @xmath73 spatial slices ; ( ii ) we will translate the pachner moves to operations on the integer string encoding .",
    "the pachner moves are transformations in the set of triangulations which are ergodic , that is , any two triangulations are related by a finite sequence of pachner moves .",
    "this connection can be used to verify the ergodicity of the pachner moves in 1 + 1 dimensions ; ( iii ) we show how to utilize the integer string encoding and the corresponding symmetry operations introduced in the main paper to single out integer strings representing unique triangulations ; and ( iv ) we compare the degeneracies arising from the binary and integer string encoding .      the minimum lattice size necessary to encode all triangulations @xmath0 up to @xmath72 forks distributed on @xmath73 spatial slices",
    "is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "to show this , let us temporarily put aside the requirement that there is at least one fork on every spatial slice , equivalent to the requirement that @xmath3 contains every element in @xmath104 at least once .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath105 , where all elements @xmath106 are the same , maximizes @xmath107 , where @xmath62 is a vector of length @xmath108 , such that @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "consequently , by reintroducing the constraint to have at least one fork per spatial slice , the string @xmath3 that will result in the largest @xmath111 , has as many elements of the same kind , that are @xmath112 d - forks on a single spatial slice @xmath113 .",
    "it is best to study this case using the dual brick picture , where it is straightforward to see that d - forks , @xmath114 , for @xmath115 , can be moved freely in both directions by using operations ( i)-(iii ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : latticesize ] ) . therefore any of the @xmath116 d - forks can be absorbed in a sequence that contains already one @xmath113 , and thus the number of sequences necessary to encode _ all _ possible triangulations with @xmath72 forks distributed on @xmath73 spatial slices is @xmath112 . according to the mapping ,",
    "( 7 ) in the main text , every sequence in @xmath65 corresponds to one row in the corresponding @xmath1 .",
    "the pachner moves are certain operations that when applied on a triangulation @xmath0 generate other triangulations @xmath117 .",
    "they are claimed to be ergodic , i.e. for any pair of triangulations , there always exists a sequence of pachner moves that one can apply on one triangulation that yield the other . for foliated triangulations in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "there are only two such moves ( called rule 1 and rule 2 , see fig .  1 of the main text ) .",
    "here we define the pachner moves in the integer string description , that is , transformations on the integer strings which correspond to applying the pachner move on the corresponding triangulation , as the following diagram illustrates . @xmath118^{\\textrm{pachner } } \\ar[r ] \\quad & \\quad t^ { * }   \\ar[r ] \\quad & \\quad s \\ar[d]^{\\textrm{``integer pachner '' } } \\\\ t '   \\ar[r ] \\quad & \\quad ( t')^ { * } \\ar[r ] \\quad & \\quad s ' \\\\ } \\label{diagram2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        the action of rule 1 ( r1 ) is easily understood in the dual triangulation , where it simply exchanges the order of two neighboring consecutive d - forks . in the integer description",
    "it corresponds to the following operation @xmath119{\\mbox{r1 } } ( \\dots , s_{i+1},s_{i},\\dots).\\ ] ] where @xmath120 .",
    "rule 2 ( r2 ) has an equally simple equivalent , @xmath121{\\mbox{r2 } }     ( \\dots,(n-1),n , n,(n+1),\\dots),\\ ] ] duplicating a d - fork and placing it right next to it .",
    "it is thus clear that r1 and r2 connect different equivalence classes in the string encoding .",
    "this demonstrates the ergodicity of the pachner moves in 1 + 1 dimensions : starting from the minimal string @xmath122 , successive application of r1 and r2 generate all possible strings , and hence all possible triangulations .",
    "[ fig_pachner_dual_fork ] shows the action of the `` integer pachner moves '' on triangulations mentioned in the main text .",
    "to evaluate the path integral of cdt in any dimensions analytically , one has to first single out triangulations which are representatives of their equivalence classes .",
    "we demonstrate how this procedure can be done in integer string encoding .",
    "first , note that to encode all triangulations of size @xmath123 distributed over @xmath73 spatial slices , one has to generate all strings containing at least @xmath73 forks and at most @xmath72 of them containing each element of @xmath124 at least once .",
    "we then apply symmetry operations ( i)-(iii ) as illustrated in the following example .",
    "consider all triangulations containing up to 5 forks distributed over 3 spatial slices .",
    "we require at least one fork on every spatial slice ; the smallest ( in terms of 2-volume ) triangulations contain 3 forks .",
    "the procedure to find the representatives for the equivalent classes is the following :    1 .",
    "generate all possible integer strings of lengths @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , with elements in @xmath128 ; 2 .",
    "consider only strings that contain every element @xmath129 at least once ( so that only connected triangulations are taken into account ) ; 3 .",
    "apply symmetry operations to single out unique triangulations / integer strings : if two integer strings are related by a sequence of the symmetry operations ( i  ii ) they are in the same equivalence class .",
    "one representative of each equivalence class give all unique histories / triangulations .",
    "it is best to demonstrate this at hand of an example .",
    "what are the representatives of triangulations containing 4 forks distributed over 3 spatial slices ? from basic combinatorics we are left with nine valid integer string encodings : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "let us to begin with focus on the dual triangulations with one extra d - fork on the third row , i.e.  @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 . utilizing the symmetry operations",
    "we can show that @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , and consequently @xmath140 and @xmath141 are redundant , and @xmath139 is a representative .",
    "similarly we get @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "altogether we can for example single out the following representatives : @xmath139 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "next we present the binary and the integer description for this set of triangulations explicitly . for the binary description",
    "we need to consider arrays of size @xmath150 ( see above ) .",
    "there is only one way to distribute 3 forks on 3 spatial slices , such that @xmath151      after applying the symmetry operations we are left with four representatives : @xmath152      after applying the symmetry operations we are left with 12 representatives : @xmath153",
    "the binary and the integer encoding differ in the size of their configuration spaces . to show this ,",
    "let us for a moment relax the constraint of only considering connected triangulations to get a rough estimate of the size of the configuration space . for @xmath154 we can simplify the minimum lattice size required to encode all triangulations to @xmath155 .",
    "thus the number of triangulations in the binary encoding is growing @xmath156 , while the size of the integer encoding grows @xmath157 .",
    "since both encodings are ergodic ( in the sense of containing all triangulations with @xmath72 forks distributed over @xmath73 spatial slices at least once ) the binary encoding is less efficient than the integer encoding . the integer encoding has the additional advantage that the degeneracies of the configuration space are related to algebraic symmetry operations acting on the strings ( see above ) .",
    "this can be demonstrated with the help of the following example .",
    "consider the integer string @xmath158 , representing a triangulation with coordination number @xmath159 everywhere except at the boundaries .",
    "even for this trivial example the mapping to a binary encoding is not unique , if the lattice size is larger then @xmath160 . in fig .",

    "<S> _ conclusion and outlook_. we have presented a binary encoding of discrete space - time in 1 + 1 dimensions . to this end , we have borrowed the discretization method of cdt and shown how to compute various quantities of interest of this theory in the binary description . </S>",

    "<S> this approach has several potential applications . to begin with </S>",
    "<S> , it provides a natural framework for quantization . </S>",
    "<S> forks , the elementary geometrical unit , constitute independent classical degrees of freedom or normal modes of discrete space - time . in the quantized theory , the presence or absence of a fork </S>",
    "<S> will be interpreted as elementary excitations of a quantum lattice gas </S>",
    "<S> . these excitations will give rise to quantum fluctuations and , more generally , to quantum states representing superpositions of different space - times . despite using a time foliation , </S>",
    "<S> our approach to quantizing space - time is conceptually different from cdt quantum gravity , which is based on a path integral formulation .    </S>",
    "<S> discretization of space - time was introduced as a regularization tool to compute the path integral of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> if one considers discrete space - time as _ real _ , then forks could be seen as fundamental constituents of space - time , namely as basic geometric structures that connect events . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum formulation of this theory would naturally introduce quantum correlations in space - time .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , from an experimental perspective , by implementing quantum lattice gas models in the way we have introduced them , one could realize quantum simulations of fluctuating space - time . </S>",
    "<S> such quantum simulators , analog or digital , could be used to simulate models of quantum gravity in modern quantum optics laboratories , e.g. using ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices or ion - traps @xcite .    </S>",
