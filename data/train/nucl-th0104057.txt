    "stochastic and monte carlo methods for bound states , however , are performed directly using position vectors in configuration space . also in momentum space",

    "benchmark calculations based on different algorithms for the 3n continuum both below@xcite and above@xcite the deuteron threshold already exist .",
    "the complicated calculation of few - body continuum states can be avoided in the evaluation of reaction cross sections , even in the presence of realistic forces @xcite .",
    "in fact the transition strength can be calculated in an alternative way , where only bound state techniques are needed @xcite .",
    "there are a few analytical solutions of 3n bound states@xcite for square - well potentials , against which numerical solutions have been checked , but they are far from possessing the complexity of realistic nuclear forces . in the four - body system",
    "we are only aware of benchmark calculations for four bosons  @xcite .",
    "benchmark calculations are extremely useful to test methods as well as calculational schemes .",
    "they are also often of interest for a general readership , since they may help to solve analogous problems in other fields .",
    "we think that this is particularly the case for the quite complex four - fermion system . here",
    "we would like to address the four - nucleon ( 4n ) bound - state problem using the av8@xmath0 nn potential@xcite which is a simplified , reprojected version of the fully realistic argonne av18 model@xcite , but still has most of its complexity , e.g. , the tensor force is built in .    in sec .",
    "2 the different methods are briefly introduced and the results are presented in sec . 3 together with a brief summary .",
    "in order to solve the bound four - nucleon system we employ the faddeev - yakubovsky equations(fy)@xcite , the coupled - rearrangement - channel gaussian - basis variational method ( crcgv)@xcite , the stochastic variational method(svm ) with correlated gaussians@xcite , the hyperspherical harmonic variational method(hh)@xcite , the green s function monte carlo(gfmc)@xcite method , the no - core shell model(ncsm)@xcite , and the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonic method(eihh)@xcite .",

    "we truncate the partial waves at a 2-body total angular momentum @xmath15 , all other orbital angular momenta at @xmath16 , and the sum of all angular momenta at @xmath17 . in this truncation",
    "we keep 1572 angular momentum and isospin combinations ( often called channels ) .",
    "this is sufficient to guarantee convergence of our results as given in sec .",
    "the diagonalization is performed by a modified lanczos method@xcite .",
    "recent results for realistic nn potentials , and including three - nucleon forces , are given in @xcite .",
    "the coupled - rearrangement - channel gaussian basis variational method was proposed by kamimura @xcite to solve the coulombic three - body problem of the muonic molecular ion @xmath18 , within an accuracy of seven significant figures for the energy of the very loosely bound @xmath19 state ; this accuracy was required for the comparison with experimental data on the muon catalyzed fusion cycle .",
    "use of basis functions that spanned all the three rearrangement jacobian coordinates was essential to the high - precision calculation .",
    "the method was also applied to three - nucleon bound states @xcite and was found to accomplish a much more rapid convergence in the binding energy with respect to the number of the three - body angular momentum channels ( see fig .",
    "5 of @xcite ) .",
    "the method was also successfully used to make another high - precision coulomb three - body calculation of the anti - protonic helium atom ( @xmath20 ) in highly excited meta - stable states with @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the calculation agreed with the high - resolution laser spectroscopic data within seven significant figures so that the mass of antiproton was derived to two orders of magnitude better precision than published values .",

    "eigen - energies and wave - function coefficients @xmath44 s are determined by solving the schrdinger equation with the rayleigh - ritz variational principle .",
    "it is to be emphasized that truncation is not made for the partial waves of the @xmath23 interaction , in contrast to the faddeev - yakubovsky method , but is done only for the angular momenta of basis functions , as in most variational methods .",
    "this makes it possible to accomplish a very quick convergence ; the result in sec .",
    "uses @xmath45 ( this is the same as in the case of the three nucleon bound states , mentioned above ) .",

    "contains @xmath58 nonlinear variational parameters .",
    "the total spin , total orbital angular momentum and intermediate coupling quantum numbers are also variational parameters in the sense that one has to include all possibilities which improve the energy .",
    "we have a large number of parameters to be optimized and it is not at all clear how to select the optimal quantum numbers",
    ".    this variational basis is nonorthogonal , none of the components is indispensable , and one can replace a component by a linear combination of others .",
    "this gives us an excellent opportunity to use a stochastic optimization procedure . to optimize the variational basis we used the `` stochastic variational method '' @xcite . in the svm one",

    "the number of basis states used in the calculations is about 150 for the triton and 300 for the alpha particle .",
    "very small bases already give quite acceptable results , for the alpha particle , for example , 50 basis states give the binding energy within 1 mev .",
    "the svm results seem to be convergent in the model space defined with 300 basis states and the partial - wave truncation with @xmath59 .",
    "we have tried to increase the accuracy by adding 700 more states and by including the partial waves up to @xmath60 but the results are practically unchanged .",
    "the 1000 bases give only 2 kev gain in energy .",
    "the enlargement of the basis improves the expectation values , especially that of the kinetic energy operator , but this change is canceled by a similar change in the central potential .",
    "we think that the upper bound provided by the svm calculation is very close to the exact energy .",
    "the accuracy achieved with few basis dimension is due to the use of the correlated gaussian basis and the efficient optimization procedure .",

    "moreover , the hh functions having the lowest orbital angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) have been included first .",

    "the chief advantage of these methods is that they can be extended to larger nuclei .",
    "more computationally efficient versions of the algorithm have been introduced and calculations extended up to a=8  @xcite .    convergence of the ground - state energy is governed by the spectra of the hamiltonian .",
    "calculations reported here were performed to @xmath85 .",
    "since the first excited state of @xmath86he is above 20 mev , any errors in @xmath79 are damped out by at least @xmath87 , an order of magnitude .",
    "in fact our studies show that the errors in @xmath79 correspond to much higher excitation energies and @xmath88 converges by @xmath89 .",
    "the gfmc method allows us to compute mixed expectation values of the form @xmath90 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "this gives the exact ground state energy if @xmath91 is large enough .",
    "expectation values of other quantities , such as pieces of the hamiltonian , are often obtained through a linear extrapolation in the error of the trial wave function : @xmath92 though it is possible to go beyond this approximation .",

    "we make an approximation by using just a two(three)-body effective interaction , which is obtained by applying the lee - suzuki approach to the two(three)-nucleon system using @xmath96 with the sums restricted to two(three ) nucleons , but with the @xmath53 in the interaction term kept fixed to , e.g. , @xmath75 for @xmath86he .",

    "the effective two(three)-body interaction , then replaces the interaction term in @xmath96 .",
    "we note that the effective interaction , by construction , converges to the original bare interaction as the basis space is increased and , thus , the ncsm calculation converges to the exact solution with the basis - space enlargement .",
    "in fact , it converges much faster than the corresponding bare interaction calculation performed in the same basis .",
    "eventually , the @xmath53-nucleon @xmath5-space calculation can be performed either in a slater - determinant single - particle ho basis or in a properly antisymmetrized jacobi - coordinate ho basis .",
    "the latter is used in the present @xmath86he calculation . in the past",
    ", we applied this approach successfully to the @xmath86he interacting by the cd - bonn nn potential .",
    "it turns out that the convergence with the av8@xmath0 is significantly slower .",
    "the limitation to a two - body effective interaction is inadequate in the @xmath5-spaces that we could access ( @xmath97 ) .",

    "then from the total hamiltonian one can extract a `` two - body '' hamiltonian of particles @xmath53 and @xmath106 ) @xmath107 which , however , contains the hyperspherical part of the total kinetic energy .",
    "since the hh functions of the @xmath105 system are eigenfunctions of @xmath108 one has an explicit dependence of @xmath109 on the quantum number @xmath110 of the residual system , i.e. @xmath111 . applying the hermitian version of the lee - suzuki method @xcite to @xmath109 one gets an effective hamiltonian @xmath112 .",

    "the solution of the schrdinger equation converges faster to the true one .",
    "the hh formulation leads to various advantages : ( i ) @xmath98 itself is @xmath62 dependent , therefore it contains some information on the `` medium '' , ( ii ) because of the above mentioned @xmath110 dependence the ( a-2 ) residual system is not a pure spectator , and ( iii ) an additional confining potential is not needed , since the presence of @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ hh2 ] ) automatically confines the two - body system to the range @xmath117 .",

    "of course for the calculation of the mean value of the hamiltonian , i. e. @xmath120 , one already makes use of an effective operator , namely @xmath121 .",

    "furthermore , in this work we omit the electromagnetic part of the interaction .",
    "the potential is local and its spin and isospin dependences are represented by operators .",
    "because of its form it is tractable for all of the calculational schemes described above .",
    "the potential consists of 8 parts : @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 stand for spin - spin , isospin - isospin , tensor and spin - orbit interactions @xcite respectively , and @xmath127 are radial functions of yukawa- and wood - saxon types .",
    "the av18 and av8 are defined with @xmath128=41.47108mev @xmath129 , computed from the average of the proton and neutron masses .",
    "most of the results reported here were obtained using the traditional value of 41.47 ; this results in a change in @xmath130 of only @xmath131 2.6 kev , far less than the estimated errors in the various methods .",
    "first , we compare the binding energy results @xmath120 , the expectation values of the kinetic and potential energy and the radii in table [ table2 ] .",
    "we find good agreement for @xmath120 within 3 digits or within 0.5 % .",
    "this is quite remarkable in view of the very different techniques and the complexity of the nuclear force chosen . except for ncsm and eihh ,",
    "the expectation values of @xmath132 and @xmath133 also agree within 3 digits .",
    "the ncsm results are , however , still within 1 % and eihh within 1.5 % of the others , but note that the eihh results for @xmath132 and @xmath134 are obtained with bare operators .",
    "the uncertainty in the ncsm results is of the same size , i.e. , 1mev , as that for the gfmc .",

    "the hh calculation includes about 4500 states with @xmath135 .",
    "the states with @xmath136 give a contribution to the binding energy of approximately @xmath137 mev .",
    "it is to be noticed that the hh spin - isospin states @xmath138 having @xmath139 but constructed with the @xmath33type jacobi coordinates are linearly dependent on those considered in the expansion and therefore it is unnecessary to include them .",

    "the mean values of different operators , evaluated for @xmath142 consisting of 2775 basis states and @xmath144 mev , were computed using effective operators as the use of bare operators is completely insufficient , in particular for the @xmath145 and @xmath132 .",
    "note that we have here @xmath146 close , but not exactly equal to @xmath147 , due to approximations used .",
    "overall , the ncsm results are less accurate than the other methods .",
    "the ncsm convergence rate is rather slow for the av8. however , the method is flexible to handle also non - local realistic potentials like the cd - bonn with a faster convergence rate due to a softer repulsive core .",

    "the eihh calculation is carried out with @xmath149 , ( about 3000 hh states ) .",
    "the error estimate is based on the convergence with respect to @xmath119 , i.e. difference of results for @xmath150 and 20 .",
    "an inspection of table i shows that @xmath120 and radius are converged to a very high precision ( @xmath120 : 0.04 % , radius : 0.007 % , not shown in table i ) . on the contrary @xmath151 and @xmath152",
    "still change by about 1 % from @xmath150 to @xmath149 .",
    "of course , by construction of the eihh method , also @xmath151 and @xmath153 have to converge to the true result . in order to have a higher precision one can proceed in two ways : ( i ) increase of @xmath119 , ( ii ) use of effective operators . particularly advantageous",
    "is the use of effective operators , since it allows us to make rather precise calculations with a small number of basis functions ( see discussion of eihh result for fig .",
    "1 ) . as table",
    "i shows it is not necessary to use effective operators for long - range observables like the radius , while observables that contain short range information ( high momentum contributions ) , like @xmath151 and @xmath153 , should , in principle , be calculated with effective operators .",
    "a more detailed test of the wave function is to evaluate the expectation values of the eight individual potential energy operators in eq .",

    "1 . the agreement among the fy , crcgv , svm , hh and ncsm is essentially perfect . for the eihh it is necessary to use an effective operator in order to obtain good convergence also for @xmath157 fm . due to the use of rather unsophisticated computers , the eihh calculation for @xmath158",
    "is performed with the rather low @xmath119 value of 12 ( about 400 hh states ) ; however , a rather good agreement with the other methods is already obtained at this low value .",
    "finally , we show in table [ table5 ] the probabilities for finding the three different total orbital angular momenta in our 4n model system .",
    "the agreement among the different methods is very good with a small excursion in ncsm .    to summarize",
    ", we have demonstrated that the schrdinger equation for a four - nucleon system can be handled quite reliably by different methods leading to very good agreement in the binding energy , in expectation values of the kinetic and potential energies and in simple wave function properties .",
    "the av8@xmath0 nn potential encompasses most of the complexity of realistic nn forces and , thus , the benchmark calculations are highly nontrivial and demonstrate the maturity and reliability of various methods .",
    "these results are good foundations for further investigations of nuclear structure for more complex systems and/or for other nn interaction models .",
    "we have chosen the av8@xmath0 potential because it can be handled without any approximation by all of our methods .",
    "more realistic nn potentials such as av18@xcite , cd - bonn  @xcite and nijmegen i , ii  @xcite pose additional difficulties for at least some of the methods .",
    "there are new operator forms with higher order derivatives or very strong nonlocalities .",
    "also some of the potentials are defined partial wave by partial wave .",
    "whereas in the four- body system the fy and ncsm schemes can handle all types of nn potentials directly , the gfmc method relies on av8 and treats the difference to av18 in perturbation theory .",
    "the svm can in principle treat any local potential , such as av18 , but the @xmath123 terms require additional computational effort .",
    "also the remaining methods , hh , crcgv and eihh can handle more complicated potentials , although at present applications have been restricted to local potentials .",
    "gfmc , ncsm , svm and eihh have already obtained solutions for @xmath159 , whereas fy up to now has been restricted to @xmath160 .",
    "an advantage of the methods , crcgv and eihh , is that they do not need as heavy computational facilities as the other methods .",
