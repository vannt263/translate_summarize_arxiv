    "fatigue refers to the changes in material properties caused by repeatedly applied loads @xcite .",
    "fatigue is quite universal and affects a broad range of materials from metals @xcite to biomaterials such as adhesion clusters of cells @xcite . in metals ,",
    "the microscopic events associated with fatigue depend on the load and usually weaken the material .",
    "for example , if loads are above a certain threshold , microscopic cracks form at stress concentrators such as the surface , persistent slip bands , and grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "eventually a crack reaches a critical size , propagates , and the structure fractures @xcite . here",
    ", we address the question of fatigue in a soft material namely a colloidal gel . under a constant stress , colloidal gels ,",
    "like many other viscoelastic solids such as foams or emulsions , flow only above a critical stress referred to as the yield stress @xmath1 .",
    "this stress - induced fluidization is involved in virtually any application of colloidal gels , and it is essential to correctly measure and control this yield stress to ensure the safe and proper use of the material .",
    "yet it has been shown in recent years that many phenomena may affect the way a material yields @xcite .",
    "slippery boundary conditions may induce the solid - body motion of the material without bulk fluidization @xcite . long and complex transient regimes may show coexistence of fluid and solid phases before a liquid - like stationary state is reached @xcite . in particular colloidal gels",
    "are prone to so - called `` delayed yielding '' where it may take a very long time for a weak gel to yield under a constant stress @xcite . for instance , a gel can fail under its own weight after several hours or days @xcite .",
    "this `` gravitational collapse '' has been associated to the progressive weakening of the gel network due to thermally activated localized rearrangements @xcite or to the interplay between the poroelasticity of the gel and gravitational compression @xcite .",
    "delayed yielding has also been investigated in gels subjected to a constant shear stress imposed by a rheometer , including carbon black gels @xcite , thermo - reversible protein gels @xcite or weak gels of polystyrene particles @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the gels are eventually fluidized after complex transient regimes .",
    "these dynamics have been related to activated processes : the applied shear stress @xmath2 decreases the energy barrier for bond breakage leading to failure times that decrease exponentially with @xmath2 @xcite . in this work we focus on the interplay between fatigue and yielding of carbon black gels under cyclic shear , a phenomenon which is comparatively much less documented in soft matter than the case of constant load .    in a previous paper devoted to large amplitude oscillatory shear stress ( laostress ) experiments",
    "@xcite , we have first shown that the classical procedure to determine the yield stress @xmath1 displays surprising results . in an oscillatory experiment at a constant frequency @xmath3 , where the amplitude @xmath0 of the shear stress is ramped up with time @xmath4",
    ", @xmath1 is defined as the stress amplitude at which the loss modulus @xmath5 overcomes the elastic modulus @xmath6  @xcite . in carbon black gels , @xmath1 depends on the velocity of the applied stress ramp @xcite : @xmath1 decreases as the ramp rate increases .",
    "this result is inconsistent with physical aging , where both @xmath6 and @xmath1 have been shown to increase@xcite .",
    "this rate dependence of @xmath1 is here one of the hallmarks of fatigue . to better characterize this fatigue - induced yielding , we performed further laostress experiments@xcite , this time keeping the stress amplitude constant to @xmath7  pa .",
    "an extensive time - resolved analysis of the strain response , of the rheological fourier spectra , and of standard lissajous plots ( stress vs strain or shear rate ) coupled to simultaneous ultrasonic imaging , showed that the gel dynamics involved two different timescales , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is associated with failure at the walls , and @xmath10 with a slower heterogeneous fluidization involving solid  fluid coexistence until the whole sample becomes liquid - like .",
    "the spatial heterogeneities observed as the gel slowly fluidizes suggested a fragmentation of the initially solid - like gel into macroscopic domains eroded by the surrounding fluidized suspension .    here",
    ", we thoroughly address the influence of the stress amplitude and of the frequency , as well as that of the carbon black concentration , on such a scenario . in sect .",
    "[ s.materials ] , we first recall the sample preparation method and the specifications of the apparatus for combining standard laostress rheology and ultrasonic imaging in order to probe the local displacement within carbon black gels during laostress experiments . in sect .",
    "[ s.results ] , we show that @xmath10 results from the accumulation of multiple yielding processes : the gel first remains solid , at @xmath9 it starts sliding against the walls , at @xmath11 it displays a bulk solid  fluid coexistence , and at @xmath10 it is finally fully fluidized . while the raw times @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 seem to display two different behaviours for low vs high stresses @xmath0 as also observed under a constant load in refs .",
    "@xcite , scaling the durations of the successive yielding processes @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 with @xmath0 allows us to describe the whole stress range within a single scaling .",
    "these results are further discussed in sect .",
    "[ s.discuss ] where we compare our data with an extension of the delayed failure model @xcite to oscillatory shear ( appendix 2 ) and with the basquin law .",
    "the extension of the delayed failure model is based on activated processes and predicts that the characteristic durations decrease exponentially with @xmath0 , whereas the basquin law predict a power - law behaviour .",
    "both models fit our data well given the small accessible range for @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we report a surprising behaviour of the parameters of the delayed yielding model and the basquin law when varying the concentration of the gel and the frequency of the oscillations .",
    "carbon black ( cb ) particles are colloidal , carbonated particles with a typical size range of 85 to 500  nm @xcite that result from the partial combustion of hydrocarbon oils .",
    "these particles are widely used in the industry for mechanical reinforcement or to enhance the electrical conductivity of plastic and rubber materials @xcite . when dispersed in a mineral oil ( density 0.838  g.@xmath14 , viscosity 20 mpa.s , sigma aldrich ) , these cb particles ( cabot vulcan xc72r of density 1.8  g.@xmath14 ) are weakly attractive with interactions of typical strength @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the botzmann constant and @xmath17  is the absolute temperature . from a dispersed state , the particles aggregate to form sample - spanning networks of fractal dimension @xmath18 even at very low concentrations @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on such gel - forming dispersions at weight concentrations of 4 , 6 and 8%  w / w .      the mechanical properties of colloidal gels are typically measured using standard rheology experiments .",
    "our rheological measurements are performed in a taylor  couette cell with smooth , polymethyl methacrylate ( pmma ) walls ( height 50 mm , rotating inner cylinder radius 48 mm , fixed outer cylinder radius 50 mm , gap width 2 mm ) with a stress - controlled rheometer ( arg2 , ta instruments ) .",
    "the temperature is controlled by a water circulation around the taylor  couette cell and fixed to @xmath19 @xmath20c for all experiments . to ensure a reproducible initial gel state , each measurement",
    "is prepared using the following sequence of steps : ( i )  we preshear the suspension at 1000  s@xmath21 and then at -1000  s@xmath21 for 20  s each to break up any large aggregates .",
    "( ii )  we let the gel rest so that it can restructure by applying a zero shear rate for 2  s and then a zero shear stress for 10  s. ( iii )  we probe the viscoelastic properties of the gel by monitoring the elastic modulus @xmath6 and loss modulus @xmath5 for 60  s at a very low stress in the linear regime ( @xmath22 pa at @xmath23 hz ) .",
    "( iv )  the sample is left to rest again for 10  s by applying a zero shear stress , which allows for possible residual stresses stored during the previous steps to relax @xcite .",
    "finally , the laostress experiment is started by applying a sinusoidal stress of amplitude @xmath0 and frequency @xmath3 starting at time @xmath24 .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details , especially on internal stresses and on issues with inertia during laostress .",
    "several techniques allow for local flow characterization under shear , e.g. rheo - optics @xcite , particle tracking @xcite , magnetic resonance imaging @xcite or ultrasonic velocimetry @xcite . here , we use high - frequency ultrasonic imaging @xcite , a technique that is fast enough to follow the yielding dynamics while being insensitive to the opaqueness of the cb gel @xcite .",
    "to provide ultrasonic contrast the gel is seeded with 1% w / w hollow glass spheres ( potters sphericel , mean diameter 6  @xmath25 m , mean density 1.1  g.@xmath14 ) .",
    "this technique is implemented on the taylor ",
    "couette experiment described in sect .",
    "[ s.rheol ] . a linear array of 128 piezoelectric transducers , immersed in the water tank and facing the outer cylinder of the taylor ",
    "couette device , sends short ultrasonic pulses with a central frequency of 15  mhz that propagate in a vertical plane inclined by about 10@xmath26 from the normal to the outer cylinder . while traveling through the taylor  couette cell , these pulses get scattered by the hollow glass spheres suspended within the cb gel . for each incident plane pulse , the backscattered signal , corresponding to the interferences of the various echoes from the hollow glass spheres , is recorded by the transducer array , leading to an `` ultrasonic speckle '' signal with 128 measurement lines and typically 800 points sampled at 160  mhz .",
    "the data analysis consists in first processing the speckle signal into a beam - formed speckle image @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the radial direction across the gap ( @xmath29 being taken at the rotating inner cylinder and @xmath30  mm at the fixed outer cylinder ) and @xmath31 is the vertical direction ( @xmath32 corresponding to about 10  mm from the top of the taylor  couette device )",
    ". then two successive speckle images are cross - correlated in order to get the tangential displacement @xmath33 as a function of @xmath28 and @xmath31 . here",
    "we set the time interval between two speckle images to five laostress oscillation periods .",
    "this allows us to map the displacement @xmath34 of the cb dispersion between successive states separated by five oscillation cycles over 32  mm along the vertical direction @xmath31 with a resolution of 250  @xmath25 m and over the 2-mm gap with a resolution of 100  @xmath25 m in the radial direction @xmath28 .",
    "this temporal and spatial resolution is ideal for following the yielding dynamics of the cb dispersion under laostress without focusing on the intracycle dynamics @xcite . for full technical details , we refer the reader to refs .",

    "like in the taylor  couette geometry , to ensure a reproducible initial state , each measurement is carried out by ( i )  preshearing the suspension at 700  s@xmath21 then at -700  s@xmath21 for 60  s in each direction , ( ii )  manually shearing the gel until normal forces cancel out , ( iii )  letting the gel rest again for 30  s and ( iv )  measuring @xmath6 and @xmath5 within the linear regime and checking that the normal force remains zero . finally , we start the laostress experiment .",
    "calibration experiments have shown that we can neglect the contribution of the centrifugal force to the measurements of @xmath43 provided that the shear rate is below 700  s@xmath21 .",
    "we checked that the shear rate never exceeded 100  s@xmath21 during the laostress experiments .",

    "this means that from one cycle to the other ( or at least every five cycles since the displacement is only sampled at 0.2  hz ) , the hollow glass spheres , and thus the gel material , returns into exactly the same position .",
    "together with the fact that @xmath37 , we interpret this as the behaviour of a homogeneous solid that adheres to the walls of the taylor  couette cell .",
    "this regime is only observed at low stress amplitudes , typically for @xmath49  pa [ see figs .",
    "[ figrheo](a ) and [ figusv](a ) for @xmath44  pa ] . for larger",
    "@xmath0 one directly observes the following second regime , i.e. one effectively has @xmath50 . for @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath33 is either zero in the bulk yet with significant values at the walls [ see @xmath52  s in fig .  [ figusv](a ) ] or shows a homogeneous non - zero value in the bulk [ see @xmath53  s in fig .  [ figusv](b ) ] .",
    "this indicates that the gel has yielded near the walls at time @xmath54 , thus creating fluidized lubrication layers at the walls although the bulk material remains solid .",
    "consequently , we observe a plug - like flow with @xmath55 for low stress but non - zero , constant displacement at higher stress amplitudes , which points to a global drift of the solid - like gel from one cycle to the other and to slippage at the walls .",
    "third , for @xmath56 , @xmath33 is constant over regions spanning a large amount of the cell gap yet separated by regions where @xmath33 shows large , fluctuating and apparently random values . as already discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , this is typical of a solid  fluid coexistence . indeed in fluidized zones , the hollow glass spheres seeding the dispersion show irreversible displacements from one oscillation cycle to the other due to their density mismatch with the cb gel .",
    "these displacements lead to decorrelation of successive ultrasonic speckle signals and thus to large erratic variations of @xmath33 . at low @xmath0 , this solid  fluid coexistence seems to occur preferentially along the vorticity direction [ see @xmath57  s in fig .",
    "[ figusv](a ) ] , whereas at higher @xmath0 , we observe a more classical coexistence in the radial direction [ see @xmath58 and 290  s in fig .",
    "[ figusv](b ) ] .",
    "the fluidized zones progressively grow and invade the whole sample until full fluidization is reached at @xmath59",
    ". finally , the cb suspension flows like a liquid thereafter for @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ figtau ] , we report the three characteristic times , @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , for different values of the imposed stress amplitude of the laostress experiment determined using the ultrasonic imaging technique .",
    "yielding was only observed in the range  @xmath61  pa . for lower values of the stress amplitude ,",

    "@xmath65 , denoted by  ( c ) , the material is heterogeneous exhibiting a coexistence of fluid - like and solid - like regions .",
    "the solid - like zones get progressively eroded by the fluid - like zones until the entire gel is fluidized at @xmath66 . a similar erosion process has been observed in laponite gels in shear - rate controlled experiments @xcite . at both _",
    "low _ and _ high stresses _ , @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 seem to follow an exponential law of type @xmath67 .",
    "the situation is complex as one can define four different @xmath68 related to @xmath11 and @xmath10 at low and high stresses . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath68 at high stresses associated with @xmath10 is interpreted as the stress barrier necessary to be overcome so that the gel yields . in the creep experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , a similar behaviour is observed and @xmath68 associated with @xmath10 is modeled in the delayed yielding framework @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the change of slope between the low and high stress regime is attributed to a change of the average number of particles involved in the weakest link of the gel network mesh .",
    "we believe that applying the delayed yielding model on @xmath10 is however inappropriate and that @xmath10 corresponds here to an accumulation of multiple yielding processes .",
    "on top of this complex spatiotemporal yielding behaviour , we observe the presence of normal forces . in fig .",
    "[ fign ] , we measure the normal force @xmath43 in the _ high stress _",
    "regime during a laostress experiment in a cone  plate geometry .",
    "we observe that @xmath45 at @xmath24 s : the gel directly yields at the wall , which is consistent with the high stress experiments in the taylor  couette geometry .",
    "we observe dramatic irreproducible fluctuations of the normal force . in our opinion",
    ", the value of the normal force might be related to residual stress within the gel @xcite .",
    "however , as soon as the gel partially fluidizes in the bulk , for @xmath56 , we consistently measure a negative normal force .",
    "this effect is robustly observed in all experiments as we varied the frequency @xmath3 or the imposed stress amplitude @xmath0 .    to understand the effect of the normal forces on the erosion process during the solid",
    " fluid coexistence , we assume that deformations within the gel are small , and we use the linearized theory of elasticity for the strand network which is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the gel is supposed uniform but partially fills the gap .",
    "such a model is derived is appendix 1 and demonstrates how normal forces directly affect the stress state within the solid fraction of the solid  fluid coexistence .",
    "we find that the presence of a negative normal force increases the maximum principal stress within the gel .",
    "therefore , if the normal force is independent of the applied stress @xmath0 , the correction to @xmath0 induced by the presence of normal forces only shifts @xmath10 to lower stresses but does not affect the scaling .",

    "the shaded area corresponds to the standard deviation.,width=283 ]      having excluded the normal forces to explain the different behaviour at low and high stresses , we turn our attention to the duration of each yielding process .",
    "we note that at _",
    "low stresses _ , all the characteristic times have a similar value @xmath70",
    ". however , at _ high stresses _ the presence of lubrication layer seems to split those characteristic times apart from one another .",
    "given the fact that in addition to @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 and @xmath9 , we can define the duration of each event and compare the _ low stress _ and _ high stress _ regimes .",
    "@xmath9 corresponds to the duration over which the gel remains entirely solid .",
    "@xmath71 is the duration of the fatigue regime when the gel slips at the wall but remains solid in bulk .",
    "@xmath72 is the duration of solid  fluid coexistence . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtaus ] , the discrepancy between low and high stresses vanishes when those three durations are plotted as functions of the stress amplitude @xmath0 . we have therefore fitted the data with a single exponential or a single power law for each one of the three durations . given the narrow range of experimentally accessible values of @xmath0 , it is difficult to discriminate between exponential and power - law fits ( see table  [ tab_1 ] for the values of the best fit parameters in both cases ) .",
    "still , this scaling allows us to distinguish three successive yielding phenomena : yielding at the wall , bulk yielding and clusters yielding .",
    "the gel hierarchically yields in time and each successive yielding process requires a higher stress barrier @xmath68 or a lower exponent @xmath73 .",
    "w / w under laostress at a frequency of @xmath23  hz . the characteristic times @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are determined from ultrasonic imaging and define the boundaries between different states encountered during the fatigue process : ( a ) solid - like state , ( b ) plug - like flow i.e. solid - body displacement with slip at the walls , ( c ) solid  fluid coexistence along the vorticity direction , and ( d ) a fluid - like state .",
    "solid lines are exponential fits based on table  [ tab_1].,width=283 ]",
    "gaining insight into the physical principles governing our experiments from a theoretical perspective remains a challenge .",
    "the entire process shows multiple yielding time scales , which suggests that many mechanisms are at play .",
    "the gel first yields at the wall : interaction between the wall and the gel should thus be taken into account .",
    "the gel then yields heterogeneously in the bulk , producing large clusters that eventually fluidize , which suggests that a mean - field theory is inappropriate . keeping those difficulties in mind , and given the fact that no theoretical approach currently responds to all those criteria , we examine two models : the basquin model and the delayed failure model . both models rely on a mean - field approach .",
    "we shall therefore apply them on homogeneous processes only , such the duration @xmath80 of the initial solid regime and that of the fatigue regime @xmath81 .",
    "the power - law behaviour of the yielding characteristic times is reminiscent of the empiric basquin law  @xcite , where @xmath82 .",
