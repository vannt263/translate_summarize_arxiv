    "understanding the mechanisms of diffraction at large energies is one of the main topics in qcd @xcite .",
    "this interest comes from the possibility that the fundamental problems of qcd in the diffractive processes are related to the perturbative and nonperturbative quark - gluon interactions .",
    "one of such problems is the role of the complex structure of qcd vacuum in parton scattering .",
    "a well - known fact is that at large energies the dominant contribution to the parton - parton scattering cross sections comes from the exchange which has the vacuum quantum numbers . at",
    "small momentum transfers this exchange can be successfully described by the famous pomeron which has @xmath1 and even signature .",
    "if the virtualities of the quarks and gluons are large enough , then the hard bfkl pomeron , based on pqcd , would play an important role .",
    "when the virtualities of the partons are small , the qcd vacuum structure becomes very important , where the soft pomeron contribution is dominant phenomenologically .",
    "the relations between the soft pomeron properties and the qcd vacuum structure are widely under discussion @xcite .",
    "the most interesting idea is relating the unusual properties of the pomeron trajectory , e.g. , its high intercept and small slope , with the existence of the _ scale _ anomaly in qcd @xcite .",
    "there is another class of diffractive process , i.e. , the hard diffraction at large @xmath2 and small virtualities of initial and final particles , which has been much less studied experimentally and theoretically . in this process",
    ", colourless exchanges between partons are involved having large momentum transfers .",
    "the simplest example of such reactions is elastic hadron - hadron scattering at large @xmath2 .",
    "it should be mentioned that the first data from isr on @xmath3 elastic scattering at large @xmath2 have already shown some unexpected results , e.g. , only one diffractive minimum was observed instead of the set of minima anticipated from the multi - pomeron exchange picture . in order to explain such phenomena , the odderon exchange hypothesis , which has @xmath4 and intercept @xmath5 , has been suggested @xcite .",
    "the peculiarity of such exchange is in its negative charge parity , which should lead in particular to the difference between the @xmath3 and the @xmath6 scattering cross sections at large energies .",
    "however it was also claimed that the modern data on @xmath3 and @xmath6 elastic scattering could be explained without introducing the odderon exchange at least at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "new data on large @xmath2 hard diffraction are now available from hera @xcite .",
    "these data show unusual energy dependence of the cross sections for vector meson electromagnetic production and thus call for new ideas as they are difficult to explain within the conventional mechanisms based on the soft pomeron exchange .",
    "recently we suggested a mechanism @xcite to understand these data by introducing a new anomalous @xmath0 exchange in regge theory , which corresponds to an effective trajectory with a high intercept @xmath8 and small slope @xmath9 .",
    "this exchange has the quantum numbers of the flavor - singlet axial - vector @xmath10 meson , i.e. , @xmath11 and odd signature , and can be considered as the natural partner of another anomalous regge trajectory , i.e. , the pomeron , which has even signature and the same parities @xmath11 .",
    "moreover we have shown that the @xmath0 exchange allows us to understand the anomalous behavior of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath12 at low @xmath13 and the universal behavior of the differential cross sections for elastic @xmath3 and @xmath6 scattering at large momentum transfers .",
    "the quantum numbers of this trajectory ( @xmath1 ) are different from those of the odderon ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and can be verified by experimental measurements on several spin - dependent cross sections @xcite .",
    "among the possible effective quark - quark interactions , there are only two kind of vertices , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which survive at high energies and whose lorentz structure does _ not _ lead to the quark helicity - flip process at large energy @xmath16 and small momentum transfer @xmath17 .",
    "the spin - flip property of the quark - quark scattering is very important for the high energy behavior of the corresponding scattering amplitude because any spin - flip amplitude should be suppressed by additional factors @xmath18 due to total angular momentum conservation .",
    "therefore only the above mentioned lorentz structures can lead to non - vanishing cross sections at large energies in the forward scattering limit .",
    "the vector - like structure @xmath19 has been suggested many years ago as a possible effective interaction induced by the soft pomeron exchange @xcite .",
    "this structure has enjoyed much success in the description of many hadron - hadron , lepton - hadron and photon - hadron reactions at small @xmath20 region ( @xmath21 gev@xmath22 ) , as well as their total cross sections , once the phenomenological pomeron trajectory and form factors are used .",
    "however the possible existence of the other important structure @xmath15 has not been noticed seriously until ref .",
    "it should be emphasized that the effective interactions for both anomalous exchanges have the structure of the product of two vector or axial - vector currents : @xmath23 for the pomeron and @xmath24 for the @xmath0 exchange .",
    "the similarity of the lorentz structure of both exchanges has probably a deep origin .",
    "the pomeron current is expected to be connected with the non - conserved dilaton current whose divergence is given by the scale anomaly , and the @xmath0 anomalous exchange is related to the non - conserved axial vector current whose divergence is given by the axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the connection between these anomalous exchanges would also be natural in susy qcd where only some definite chiral combinations @xmath25 correspond to superfields @xcite , which leads to an expectation that these trajectories are degenerate in susy qcd .    on the hadronic level the anomaly manifests itself in unusual decay rates .",
    "the famous example is the axial anomaly in @xmath26 decay due to triangle graph contribution to the transition amplitude .",
    "the large mass of the @xmath27 meson is also related to the large mixing of this flavor singlet with gluons due to axial anomaly .",
    "recently it was suggested that abnormal properties of pomeron trajectory would be explained by the large mixing between glueball and @xmath28 trajectories @xcite . in the axial vector channel",
    "the lowest meson state with the appropriate quantum numbers , @xmath29 and @xmath1 , is the @xmath10 .",
    "this flavor - singlet axial vector meson can couple to the quarks through mixing with a two gluon state due to triangle anomaly . in accordance with the landau - yang theorem the coupling of @xmath30 state to two gluon state vanishes for on - shell gluons",
    ". therefore the intermediate gluons should be highly virtual to give a contribution to the @xmath31 coupling and we thus consider @xmath31 vertex as _ point - like_.    the diffractive electromagnetic production of vector mesons is one of the appropriate processes for testing different perturbative qcd and qcd - inspired nonperturbative models for quark - quark scattering .",
    "recently new experimental data on photo- and electro - production of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 mesons at large energyies @xmath35 gev , and large momentum transfers , up to @xmath36 gev@xmath22 in elastic production and up to @xmath37 gev@xmath22 in low - mass dissociation , have been reported @xcite . at small @xmath20 and large @xmath38 ,",
    "the fixed - target photoproduction data have been described successfully within the soft pomeron exchange models with the universal pomeron trajectory @xmath39 .",
    "but the reported new data violate this universality at large @xmath20 region @xcite . in order to describe such observations in terms of regge trajectories , an additional pomeron , called _ hard _ pomeron , with the trajectory",
    "@xmath40 has been proposed @xcite .",
    "however it is not yet certain whether this approach can also describe the energy independence of the elastic @xmath3 and @xmath6 cross sections at large energies and momentum transfers .    in a recent paper @xcite we have shown that the anomalous @xmath0 exchange can describe both the elastic hadron - hadron and @xmath41 photoproduction cross sections in a consistent way . in the calculation of the @xmath0 exchange contribution to @xmath32 and @xmath34 photoproduction ,",
    "we have assumed a specific phenomenological form factor in the @xmath42 vertex , which we would like now to relax .",
    "furthermore the strength of this vertex was fixed from the decay width of @xmath43 , which is a questionable procedure for parameters to be used in high energy scattering where the quark structure of the hadrons is important .",
    "moreover the absence of experimental data on the @xmath44 decay did not allow us to estimate the @xmath45 exchange contribution to @xmath33 meson photoproduction .",
    "-0.5 cm    in this work we use a method similar to that used to calculate the pomeron exchange contribution to vector meson production in ref .",
    "we then generalize the approach to include the @xmath0 exchange process in the same production amplitude .",
    "one important feature of this approach is that we have less parameters for photoproduction and that it can be generalized straightforwardly to electroproduction .",
    "the pomeron exchange contribution in the electromagnetic production of vector mesons is presented in fig .",

    "energy reads @xmath46 ^ 2 f(t , q^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath47 accounts for the nonlocality of the pomeron - quark vertex .    -0.5",
    "cm    the contribution of the @xmath0 exchange to vector meson electromagnetic production ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1diag ] ) is obtained in a similar manner as in the calculation of the pomeron exchange amplitude .",
    "the main difference lies on the substitution of @xmath48 matrix in the effective pomeron - quark vertex by @xmath49 in the effective @xmath0-quark vertex .",
    "note that we do not have any new free parameters for this exchange since the coupling constant @xmath50 is fixed by @xmath51 which can be obtained using a constituent quark picture for the nucleon wave function .",
    "it should be mentioned that this relation is different from the additivity of the pomeron coupling , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "( [ gnn ] ) implies is that the axial vector coupling is sensitive only to the spin of the particle . in our calculation",
    "we use @xmath53 that is obtained from the analyses of the @xmath0 contribution to the proton spin ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . then the final form for the @xmath0 exchange contribution to transverse virtual photoproduction cross section is ( for @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) @xmath56 ^ 2 , \\label{cross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the flavor singlet axial vector form factor of the nucleon . in fig",
    "[ fig : diff0 ] we present the calculated differential cross sections for vector meson ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) photoproduction together with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the parameters are @xmath58 gev@xmath59 , @xmath60 gev@xmath59 and @xmath61 gev@xmath22 .",
    "-0.5 cm    one can see that our model reproduces the experimental data successfully .",
    "it should be mentioned that the @xmath0 contribution dominates over that of the pomeron in the large @xmath20 region .",
    "this dominance is closely related to the slow decrease of the flavor singlet axial vector form factor of the nucleon with respect to @xmath20 as compared with that of the electromagnetic form factor , and to the different slopes of the trajectories .",
    "the recent report on vector meson photoproduction at large @xmath2 in proton dissociation by the zeus collaboration @xcite shows a surprising behaviour of the differential cross sections .",
    "the differential cross section data have very hard @xmath2 dependence .",
    "the observed data have @xmath62 dependence instead of the @xmath63 dependence which is expected from the pqcd approach . within our model",
    "the dominant contribution to the proton dissociation at large @xmath2 comes from the @xmath0 exchange between the proton quarks and the quark - antiquark pair arising from the photon .",
    "it was mentioned that it would be a good approximation to consider the @xmath0-quark vertex as a point - like vertex .",
    "thus the main difference between the @xmath0 contributions to elastic [ eq . ( [ cross ] ) ] and dissociative production of vector mesons is the absence of the proton form factor in the formula for the differential cross section , @xmath64 ^ 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the distribution of @xmath66-quark ( @xmath67 ) in the proton , @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the mass of the dissociative system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeusdis ] we show the results of our calculation together with preliminary zeus data @xcite .",
    "we have used the zeus cut @xmath70 and lo grv98 @xcite partonic distributions .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is rather good .",
    "the deviation at large @xmath2 may be due to the manifestation of non - zero ( although small ) slope of the @xmath0 trajectory ( dashed line ) or the deviation from the locality of the @xmath0-quark vertex .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath0 anomalous trajectory contribution to vector meson electromagnetic production and have shown its important role in differential cross sections at large momentum transfers .",
    "the proton dissociation at large @xmath2 is one of the processes where the contribution from the @xmath0 exchange is very large .",
    "we have shown that the additional anomalous trajectory can explain preliminary zeus data reasonably .",
