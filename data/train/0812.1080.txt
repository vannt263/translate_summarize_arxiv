    ", there has been a renewed interest in hilbert geometries and many research papers were published , see @xcite to cite just a few of them .",
    "a natural question is to classify hilbert metrics up to bilipschitz maps or up to quasi - isometries . in this direction , it was shown by colbois and verovic @xcite that if @xmath9 is @xmath10 with positive gauss curvature , then the hilbert metric is bilipschitz to the @xmath11-dimensional hyperbolic metric . in a similar spirit , it was shown in @xcite that the volume entropy of an @xmath11-dimensional convex body with @xmath12 boundary equals the volume entropy of hyperbolic space , which is @xmath13 . since the volume entropy is an invariant under bilipschitz maps , the hilbert metric of a body with @xmath12 boundary can not be bilipschitz to a normed vector space .    on the other extreme , hilbert metrics of polygons",
    "are bilipschitz to normed spaces , as was shown by colbois , vernicos and verovic @xcite . elaborating an argument of foertsch and karlsson @xcite , colbois and verovic @xcite showed that if the hilbert metric of a compact convex body is quasi - isometric to a normed vector space ( in particular , if it is bilipschitz ) , then the body is a polytope ( recall that a polytope is the convex hull of a finite number of points ) .",
    "this raised the question whether the converse holds in general , i.e. if the hilbert metric of any polytope is quasi - isometric ( or bilipschitz ) to a normed vector space .",
