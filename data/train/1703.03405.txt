    "<S> it is shown that calculation of the momentum fisher information of the quasi - one - dimensional hydrogen atom recently presented by a saha , b talukdar and s chatterjee ( 2017 025103 ) is wrong . </S>",
    "<S> a correct derivation is provided and its didactical advantages and scientific significances are highlighted .    </S>",
    "<S> .7 in    recently , a calculation of the position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 fisher informations was presented for i ) a linear harmonic oscillator , ii ) a quasi - one - dimensional hydrogen atom and iii ) an infinite potential well @xcite . by general definition @xcite , these quantum - information measures for arbitrary one - dimensional ( 1d ) structures are defined as [ fisher1 ] @xmath2 </S>",

    "<S> real position wave function @xmath8 and associated eigen energy @xmath14 are found from the 1d schrdinger equation : @xmath15 with @xmath16 being a mass of the particle and @xmath17 being an external potential .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we point out that for the infinite potential well of the width @xmath18 the fisher informations were calculated before @xcite where the position component was evaluated directly from eq .   whereas for finding @xmath19 an elegant and didactically instructive method was used ; namely , since for this geometry both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are real , the integrand in eq </S>",

    "<S> turning to the discussion of the quasi-1d hydrogen atom , it has to be noted that a problem of the quantum motion along the whole @xmath3 axis , @xmath25 , in the potential @xmath26 , despite its long history , still remains ( owing to the strong singularity at the origin and concomitant difficulty of matching right and left solutions at @xmath27 ) a topic of debate and controversy , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and literature cited therein . </S>",
    "<S> a situation is somewhat simplified when one confines the motion only to the right half space terminated at @xmath27 by the infinite barrier . </S>",

    "<S> upon introducing coulomb units where energies and distances are measured in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively @xcite , and momenta  in units of @xmath32 , one arrives at the differential equation @xmath33 whose general solution for the negative energies , @xmath34 , corresponding to the bound states , reads : @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are kummer , or confluent hypergeometric , functions ( we follow the notation adopted in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> remaining part must decay sufficiently fast at infinity . from the properties of the kummer function @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it follows that it is possible only when its first parameter is equal to the nonpositive integer what immediately leads to the energy spectrum coinciding with the 3d hydrogen atom @xcite @xmath42 whereas the corresponding waveform simplifies to @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , being a generalized laguerre polynomial @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> , the product of the two informations stays the same for all levels . </S>",
