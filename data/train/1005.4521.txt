    "in the standard model ( sm ) , fermions acquire masses via spontaneous breakdown of su(2 ) gauge symmetry . however , the values of fermion masses and the observed hierarchical fermion spectra are not understood within the sm .",
    "this results in thirteen free parameters in the sm which includes three charged lepton masses , six quark masses and the four parameters of the ckm matrix .",
    "the symmetries of the sm do not allow non - zero neutrino masses through renormalizable yukawa couplings . however ,",
    "non - zero neutrino masses can be introduced via non - renormalizable higher dimensional operators presumably having their origin in physics beyond the sm .",
    "radiative and seesaw mechanisms often supplimented by additional inputs like texture zeros and flavor symmetries are widely discussed mechanisms for fermion mass generation .",
    "these mechanisms , most often , complement and reinforce each other . in the ongoing decade , significant advances have been made in understanding these mechanisms .",
    "in particular texture zeros and flavor symmetries have provided quantitative relationships between flavor mixing angles and the quark / lepton mass ratios .",
    "it has , now been realized that the `` see - saw gut '' scenario , on its own , can not provide a complete understanding of the flavor structure of the quark and lepton mass matrices and new physics seems to be essential perhaps in the form of new symmetries mainly in the lepton sector .",
    "moreover , a unified description of flavor physics and cp - violation in the quark and lepton sectors is absolutely necessary .",
    "this can be achieved by constructing a low energy effective theory with the sm and some discrete non - abelian family symmetry and , subsequently , embedding this theory into grand unified theory ( gut ) models like so(10)@xcite .",
    "for this reason , the discrete symmetry will have to be a subgroup of so(3 ) or su(3)@xcite .",
    "the search for an adequate discrete symmetry has mainly focussed on the minimal subgroups of these groups with at least one singlet and one doublet irreducible representation to accommodate the fermions belonging to each generation .",
    "one such subgroup is the quaternion group @xmath0@xcite which not only accommodates the three generations of fermions but also explains the rather large difference between values of 2 - 3 mixings in the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "discrete quaternion groups have been extensively studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a subgroup of @xmath1 . a two - dimensional representation of @xmath0 is provided by the eight unimodular unitary matrices ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) where @xmath6 is the @xmath7 unit matrix and ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are the pauli matrices .",
    "there are five irreducible representations of @xmath0 corresponding to the five conjugacy classes in which the elements of @xmath0 are divided and are conveniently denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the su(2 ) decomposition of these irreducible representations is given by @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the irreducible representations @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 having the same group properties are equivalent and are , hence , interchangeable . the basic tensor product rule for @xmath0 is @xmath7 = @xmath19 .",
    "the quarks and leptons can be differentiated by assigning them to different irreducible representations of @xmath0 in the following manner :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the flavor index .",
    "the higgs doublets have the following @xmath0 assignments : @xmath23    @xmath24    electroweak symmetry breaking generates the charged fermion mass terms @xmath25 and the neutrino mass terms @xmath26 .",
    "the entries in the fermion mass matrices are associated with @xmath0 assignments of the corresponding fermion bilinears leading to    @xmath27    and    @xmath28    the @xmath11 contribution in the 2 - 3 sector of the majorana neutrino mass matrix is forbidden because of the symmetry of the mass matrix .",
    "nonzero entries in the neutrino mass matrix are induced by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higgs triplets transforming in the corresponding @xmath0 irreducible representation .",
    "these triplet vevs are induced by trilinear couplings of the type @xmath29@xcite .",
    "two higgs doublets generate the masses for charged fermions .",
    "at least four higgs triplets are needed to correctly reproduce the current neutrino data .",
    "nonzero mixing in the solar sector requires the vevs of @xmath30 .",
    "the other two higgs triplets @xmath31 and @xmath32 must transform in two different 1-dimensional representations of @xmath33 for which four distinct choices are possible corresponding to @xmath33 assignments relative to @xmath34 and @xmath35 viz . (",
    "i ) @xmath36 ( ii ) @xmath37 ( iii ) @xmath38 ( iv ) @xmath39 .    the resulting majorana neutrino mass matrices@xcite corresponding to the above @xmath0 assignments are    @xmath40    @xmath41    in the charged lepton basis .",
    "out of these four possible scenarios for the majorana neutrino mass matrix , the scenario @xmath42 and @xmath43 are excluded by the present experimental data on neutrino masses and mixings@xcite .",
    "in fact , scenario @xmath44 and @xmath42 correspond to two texture zero neutrino mass matrices studied extensively in the literarture@xcite and leptogenesis in these two scenarios have been investigated@xcite .",
    "however , the hybrid scenario @xmath45 is a new scenario predicted by the @xmath0 symmetry with a normal hierarchy of neutrino masses and non - zero 1 - 3 mixing angle@xcite . in this scenario",
    ", equalities between mass matrix elements can coexist with texture zeros .",
    "it is extremely important to investigate the connection between the textures of fermion mass matrices and the observables of flavor mixing .",
    "discrete quaternion groups have been extensively applied to flavor physics@xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , important to subject models based on @xmath0 , in particular , to the test of a viable leptogenesis to explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "leptogenesis is based on the @xmath46 asymmetry generated through out of equilibrium lepton number violating decays of heavy majorana neutrinos resulting in a lepton asymmetry which is subsequently transformed into a baryon asymmetry via @xmath47 violating sphaleron processes and depends on the structure of majorana neutrino mass matrix . in the present work ,",
    "we study the cp asymmetry in the hybrid scenario @xmath45 predicted by @xmath0 symmetry and examine its implications for leptogenesis and the resulting baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "we consider the following neutrino mass matrix with a hybrid texture resulting from @xmath0 symmetry : @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are complex , in general . in the framework of type - i",
    "seesaw mechanism@xcite , the effective light neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix and @xmath56 is the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the number of physical seesaw parameters contained in @xmath57 and @xmath58 on the right hand side is double the number of parameters in the low energy neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 . as a result ,",
    "the reconstruction of the seesaw is not possible solely from low energy neutrino physics and one requires additional observables .",
    "one such observable which can be used in reconstructing the seesaw is the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) .",
    "the seesaw matrices @xmath57 and @xmath58 are totally unknown and even the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath53 is not completely known . in the absence of a complete knowledge of @xmath53 and @xmath58 , there are an infinite number of possibilities for the seesaw dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath57 resulting in the so - called seesaw degeneracy@xcite . therefore , to facilitate the reconstruction of the seesaw , one is constrained to make additional assumptions about the seesaw matrices motivated by some specific models .",
    "however , in general , in the absence of a specific model in hand , the best one can do is to parametrize one s ignorance and that was the approach followed by casas and ibarra culminating in the so - called casas - ibarra ( ci ) parametrization@xcite given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 are light neutrino masses ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 are right handed majorana neutrino masses ) , @xmath64 neutrino mixing matrix and @xmath65 is a complex orthogonal matrix .",

    "baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) poses a puzzle for particle physics as well as cosmology .",
    "even though the standard model ( sm ) has all the ingredients@xcite necessary for the dynamical generation of baryon asymmetry , it fails to explain the observed baryon asymmetry as the sm cp - violation is too small to generate the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) is not strongly first order as required for successful baryogenesis .",
    "baryogenesis , thus , requires new physics beyond the sm essentially in the form of new sources of cp - violation and must either provide a departure from thermal equilibrium in addition to the electroweak phase transition or modify the electroweak phase transition itself .",
    "some of the possible new physics mechanisms are affleck - dine mechanism@xcite , gut baryogenesis@xcite and baryogenesis via leptogenesis@xcite etc .. out of these scenarios , the last one is particularly appealing since there is a plethora of reasons to believe that the sm is only a low energy effective theory and there are strong indications of new physics at a higher energy scale . the experimental evidence for massive neutrinos , the dark matter puzzle apart from the fine tuning problem of the higgs mass and the gauge coupling unification are some of these reasons for invoking physics beyond the sm .",
    "it is , particularly interesting to note that the mechanism of baryogenesis via leptogenesis is motivated by some of the reasons listed above . in this mechanism ,",
    "heavy singlet neutrinos are introduced via the seesaw mechanism whose yukawa couplings provide new sources of cp - violation essential for a viable leptogenesis .",
    "the rates of these new yukawa interactions can be slow enough to generate departure from thermal equilibrium .",
