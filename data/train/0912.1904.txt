    "this paper describes the coefficients in an asymptotic expansion of the logarithm of the partition function , @xmath3 , @xmath4 for certain ensembles of random hermitian matrices .",
    "( see theorem [ eqmsthm ] for a precise statement . )",
    "as is familiar from general contexts of statistics and probability theory , these coefficients contain a great deal of information about expectations and correlation functions with respect to the gibbs measure that underlies the given random matrix ensemble . in our context",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of @xmath5 ( often called the _ free energy _ ) as the size , @xmath0 , of the matrices becomes large .",
    "these ensembles , and hence the asymptotic coefficients @xmath6 , as well , depend on a coupling parameter @xmath2 ( the analogue of the inverse temperature in the classical setting of the canonical ensemble ) .",
    "it is natural to view the @xmath7 as generating functions for the just - mentioned expectations and correlation functions and therefore it is of value to know as much as possible about how these coefficients depend on the coupling parameters .",
    "we will derive general closed form expressions for _ all _ of the coefficients , viewed as generating functions , in our asymptotic expansions as well as in certain derivatives of these expansions .",
    "we will show that , with only a couple exceptions , they are all rational functions of a single irrational ( algebraic ) function of @xmath2 which we denote by @xmath8 .",
    "more succinctly , we will see that , for @xmath9 , @xmath10 it is a standard and fairly elementary fact that a generating function is rational if and only if its sequence of coefficients eventually ( i.e. , beyond a certain order ) satisfies a _ linear _ recurrence relation @xcite .",
    "the generating functions , such as @xmath7 , that we will describe are not rational in @xmath2 ; however , the result just mentioned suggests that if @xmath6 is indeed rational in @xmath8 , then it should in fact be possible to recursively construct it from @xmath8 .",
    "this is , in effect , the viewpoint which guided our derivation of the rational form of the @xmath6 and other generating functions that arise as coefficients in asymptotic expansions closely related to our partition function expansions ( see theorems [ egratl ] and [ result ] ) . for the fundamental function , @xmath11 itself , we are able to describe it very explicitly from several different perspectives . for instance , it is itself the generating function for _ generalized catalan numbers _ which are familiar constructs in _",
    "enumerative combinatorics_.    putting all this together , our results provide a fairly detailed and systematic understanding of the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions for the random matrix ensembles that we study .",
    "while this is interesting in and of itself , there is another level of applications for these results .",
    "the correlation functions that we are discussing also have a combinatorial interpretation related to _",
    "diagrammatic expansions _ that are familiar in statistical physics .",
    "the @xmath7 can be topologically identified as generating functions that count labelled maps .",
    "roughly speaking , a _ map _ is an embedding of an oriented graph into a compact , oriented and connected surface @xmath12 with the requirement that the complement of the graph in the surface should be a disjoint union of simply connected open sets .",
    "a labelled map is a map on which the vertices of the embedded graph have been ordered .",
    "( two such labelled maps are equivalent if the respective graphs can be smoothly deformed into one another within the surface . )",
    "the @xmath13 taylor coefficient of @xmath7 is an integer equal to the number of distinct equivalence classes of maps to a compact , oriented riemann surface of genus @xmath14 that can be constructed using exactly @xmath15 vertices and where each vertex has the same valence .",
    "( this valence is given by a weight associated to the coupling parameter .",
    "see section [ diffweights ] and theorem [ thm:01 ] . ) the results presented in this paper yield recursion formulae for the coefficients of these generating functions , now viewed as counting functions for labelled maps , that are based on the partial fractions expansions of the rational forms of the @xmath6 and related generating functions",
    ".    of particular interest is the new light that this application sheds on a 20 year old problem stemming from the physics literature on 2d quantum gravity @xcite . in mathematical terms",
    "this problem asks for the detailed description of a particular _ double - scaling limit _ of the random matrix partition function .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the history and background .",
    "we can give an idea of the contribution of our work to this problem by mentioning that @xmath11 is the profile of the self - similar solution to an inviscid burgers equation ( see section [ ibe ] ) . from the method of characteristics",
    "one may conclude that @xmath11 has an analytic continuation to the complex @xmath2-plane minus a branch cut that extends from @xmath16 to a critical value @xmath17 along the negative real axis .",
    "this critical time is in fact the _ shock time _ at which the burgers caustic starts to form .",
    "one then defines the double - scaling limit to be the limit in which @xmath18 within a sector of the complex plane with @xmath19 while at the same time @xmath20 so that the similarity variable @xmath21 remains fixed at some finite , non - zero value ( @xmath22 is a constant to be determined ) . because of our rationality result , we are , first of all , able to conclude that the coefficients , @xmath7 , all have the same envelope of holomorphy as @xmath11 , which is the above mentioned slit plane with a common singularity at @xmath23 .",
    "but , more strikingly , what we find in the double scaling limit , is that the dependence on the combinatorial information in @xmath11 washes out , so that all that remains in the limit is the information that can be deduced from the structure of @xmath6 as a rational function of @xmath8 , and that rational structure is what we describe in this paper .",
    "one may study the asymptotics of the free energy directly in the double - scaling limit .",
    "this in fact was done , for a particular ensemble , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) via a riemann - hilbert representation of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the exponential weight that determines the gibbs measure for the matrix ensemble under consideration .",
    "they find that this riemann - hilbert problem can be deformed into the riemann - hilbert problem for the first painlev transcendent ( pi ) with respect to the parameter @xmath24 in the double - scaling limit . through this",
    "they are , roughly speaking , able to relate the double scaling limit of @xmath25 to an asymptotic expansion of pi in a sector of the @xmath24 plane .",
    "our approach is also based on the riemann - hilbert problem for orthogonal polynomials , but we develop explicit expressions for the double scaling asymptotics of the partition function , for a very general class of ensembles , in terms of our representations of the map counting functions as rational functions of @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with the results for the special case considered in @xcite and therefore gives , for the first time as far as we aware , a _ direct and explicit _ interpretation of the coefficients for the pi asymptotic expansion in terms of the graphical enumeration of labelled maps .",
    "this connection opens up some interesting new directions for investigation that will be briefly discussed in section [ dsii ] .",
    "the rest of this introduction will amplify upon and detail the themes that have just been sketched .",
    "the ensembles of interest in this paper are a sub - family of what are known as the unitary ensembles ( ue ) of random matrices ; the common space of these ensembles is the space , @xmath26 , of @xmath27 hermitian matrices , @xmath28 .",
    "the gibbs measures for the ensembles we consider are given by the following family of probability measures , @xmath29\\right\\ } dm,\\,\\ , \\mbox{where}\\\\ \\label{i.001b } v_\\nu(\\lambda ; \\ t_{2\\nu } ) & = &   \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^{2 } +   t_{2\\nu } \\lambda^{2\\nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the parameter @xmath30 is assumed to be such that the integral converges .",
    "for example , one may suppose that @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath32 , which serves to make @xmath33 be a probability measure , is called the _ partition function _ of this unitary ensemble . because the trace , tr , is invariant under conjugation and since @xmath28 is hermitian , this partition function reduces to an expression which is proportional to the following multivariate density expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath34 of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 \\right\\ } } d^{n } \\lambda.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath36 differs from @xmath37 only by an overall factor which is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "( that is because the reduction to eigenvalues comes from a change of variables on @xmath28 that conjugates it to a diagonal matrix ; given the invariance of the trace under conjugation , the effect of this variable change is only seen in @xmath38 and does not involve @xmath2 . ) in all our considerations , we will always be working with @xmath39 .",
    "so from this perspective , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are equivalent .    for the coupling weight @xmath40",
    ", we will henceforth often drop the subscript @xmath41 and just write @xmath42 ; similarly , for the coupling parameter @xmath30 we will usually drop the subscript @xmath43 and just write @xmath2 .",
    "which value of @xmath41 is intended should be clear from context .",
    "( however see section [ diffweights ] for further comment . )    in studying asymptotic questions we will always assume that @xmath0 and @xmath15 go to infinity together such their ratio @xmath44 remains constant at a finite , non - zero value . when @xmath45 , the gibbs measure ( [ rmt ] ) is the measure for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue )",
    ". we will typically want to work with a rescaling of our matirx ensembles given by @xmath46 and which we will refer to as the _",
    "fine scale_. in terms of this calibration , the probability measure at @xmath45 is    @xmath47\\right\\ } da.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the general partition function associated to the measure @xmath33 , or equivalently the integral ( [ i.001 ] ) , can be expressed as an expectation with respect to the gue ensemble .",
    "first observe that    @xmath48\\right\\ } dm\\\\ \\nonumber & = & n^{-n^2/2 } \\int_{\\mathcal{h}_n }   \\exp\\left\\{-   \\,\\ , \\mbox{tr } [ 1/2 \\ , a^2 + \\frac{t}{n^{\\nu-1 } } a^{2\\nu}]\\right\\ } da\\\\ \\nonumber & = & 2^{n/2 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)^{n^2/2 }   \\,\\ , \\mathbb{e}_{\\mu_0}\\left ( \\exp\\left\\{- \\frac{t}{n^{\\nu-1}}\\mbox{tr } [ a^{2\\nu}]\\right\\}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 denotes the expectation with respect to the measure ( [ gue ] ) .",
    "it is then natural to define a function that interpolates naturally between the matrix and eigenvalue representations of the partition functions :    @xmath50\\right\\}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is called the @xmath13 scaled _",
    "tau function_. the _ unscaled _ tau function is @xmath52 .",
    "a primary motivation for carrying out the detailed asymptotic analysis of the integrals ( [ i.001 ] ) is the insight it yields into current problems of asymptotic combinatorics , specifically related to graphical enumeration .",
    "the work here builds on the systematic asymptotic analysis of ( [ i.001 ] ) that was carried out in @xcite .",
    "in particular we take as our starting point the following two theorems from this prior work .",
    "@xcite [ eqmsthm ] there is a constant @xmath53 such that for ( complex ) @xmath2 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 and for @xmath44 in a neighborhood , @xmath56 , of @xmath57 , one has a uniformly valid asymptotic expansion @xmath58 as @xmath20 .",
    "the meaning of this expansion is : if you keep terms up to order @xmath59 , the error term is bounded by @xmath60 , where the constant @xmath61 is independent of @xmath62 and @xmath2 in the domain @xmath63 . for each @xmath64 ,",
    "the function @xmath65 is a locally analytic function of @xmath2 in a ( complex ) neighborhood of @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , the asymptotic expansion of @xmath2-derivatives of @xmath66 may be calculated via term - by - term differentiation of the above series .",
    "@xmath67    in @xcite , the result was stated only for the special case when @xmath57 . however , it is straightforward to extend this result to the more general setting stated here and this was explained in @xcite .",
    "for the later parts of this paper ( sections 3 and higher ) we will take @xmath57 so that @xmath68 . in this case we will denote the partition function @xmath69 by just @xmath70 and @xmath7 will denote @xmath71 . @xmath67    our focus will be on the coefficients , @xmath7 , which have a direct combinatorial meaning that we now briefly explain .",
    "the @xmath6 enumerate labeled maps .",
    "this has already been described in the opening paragraphs of the introduction . here",
    "we will give the formal and more precise definition .    a _ map _",
    "@xmath72 on a compact , oriented and connected surface @xmath12 is a pair @xmath73)$ ] where    * @xmath74 is a connected 1-complex ; * @xmath75 $ ] is an isotopical class of inclusions @xmath76 ; * the complement of @xmath74 in @xmath12 is a disjoint union of open cells ( faces ) ; * the complement of the vertices in @xmath74 is a disjoint union of open segments ( edges ) .",
    "we introduce the notion of a _",
    "g - map _ which is a map in which the surface @xmath12 is the closed , oriented riemann surface of genus @xmath14 and which in addition carries a labeling ( ordering ) of the vertices .",
    "[ thm:01]@xcite [ geomasymp ] the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion ( [ i.002 ] ) satisfy the following relations .",
    "let @xmath14 be a nonnegative integer .",
    "then @xmath77 in which each of the coefficients @xmath78 is the number of g - maps with @xmath79 @xmath43-valent vertices .",
    "due to this interpretation , the asymptotic expansion ( [ i.002 ] ) is often referred to as the _ genus expansion_.",
    "it is natural to inquire whether there is a generating function representation for _ unlabeled _ maps .",
    "after all it is these objects that would seem to have the more purely geometric character . indeed if it were the case that the action of relabeling a labeled map always produced a distinct other labeled map , then for each unlabeled map with @xmath79 vertices , one would have @xmath80 distinct labeled maps and @xmath81 ( the _ actual _ taylor coefficients of @xmath7 up to a sign ) would give the count of unlabeled maps .",
    "however , it can happen that a relabeling produces the same labeled map and hence this way of counting is not generally valid .",
    "there are some ad hoc fixes for this but we will not go into these since that would take us too far from our main thrust ; but , it is worth noting that the kinds of isotropies that cause the problem tend to be restricted to low values of the parameters .",
    "so for certain asymptotic considerations , such as the behavior of these coefficients as @xmath82 , the effect of the isotropies `` wash out '' .",
    "see section [ other ] for a related discussion .",
    "one may also ask about the consideration of more general weights , for instance of the form @xmath83 which would correspond to allowing for odd valences and , moreover , for _ mixed _ valences when there are two or more non - vanishing coupling constants , @xmath84 .",
    "in fact versions of both theorems [ eqmsthm ] and [ thm:01 ] were proven in this generality in @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper could , in principle , be developed in greater generality along these lines .",
    "however , to avoid over - complication of the main ideas we will restrict attention here to the case of pure ( but arbitrary ) , even valence .",
    "there is another ( discrete ) parameter , @xmath41 , in the partition function ( [ i.001 ] ) that determines the exponential weight @xmath85 in the associated measures .",
    "( graphically it determines the uniform vertex valence of the maps enumerated by the @xmath6 . )",
    "the associated coupling parameter @xmath2 in the weight should more properly be denoted by @xmath30 to distinguish the different weights . however , as is evident from statements in previously cited theorems of this introduction , we have in general suppressed the dependence on @xmath41 in expressions related to @xmath86 or derived from it . in part",
    "this is to avoid cumbersome notation . in all results and arguments presented in this paper ,",
    "@xmath41 is a fixed parameter .",
    "it does not appear in any of the scalings we discuss .",
    "the role that @xmath41 plays should always be clear from context .",
    "but there is a more salient structural reason why it is natural to omit the explicit @xmath41-dependence : the formulae for coefficients in the genus expansion that we derive all have a _ universal _ character in @xmath41 ; that is to say , the structure of each of these formulae is that of a global meromorphic function of an irrational algebraic function @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 ) . although @xmath41 does appear as a discrete parameter in each of these functions",
    ", it does not alter that function s essential meromorphic form .",
    "for example , we will show ( see theorem [ egratl ] ) that , for @xmath9 , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a polynomial of degree @xmath91 .",
    "in particular , the integer - valued functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 are independent of @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , in all cases , the explicit dependence on @xmath41 in such formulae can be completely determined by a finite number of specializations at specific values of @xmath41 ( @xmath41 is a positive integer ) .",
    "similar structural properties will be shown to hold for the coefficients of related asymptotic expansions .",
    "the generating functions that we will describe are not rational in @xmath93 ; however , as has already been mentioned , we will show that they are rational functions of a fundamental generating function @xmath87 .",
    "this breaks the problem of describing these generating functions into two parts .",
    "the first is to determine the rational functions as explicitly as possible to the point that one could say something about the associated recursion relation or some other explicit finite description .",
    "the main point of the present paper is to make progress on this part of the problem .",
    "the second part is to describe @xmath87 .",
    "although it is not rational we are actually able , based on @xcite , to deduce very explicit information about this algebraic function .    over the course of this and the next section we will present four different ways of defining @xmath87 , all of which play a role in describing and applying the structure of the coefficients of the genus expansion and related geometric expansions .",
    "these four different characterizations are    * as a generating function for the generalized catalan numbers ( section [ gcn ] ) ; * as the leading order term in the large @xmath0 expansion of the recurrence coefficients for monic orthogonal polynomials with respect to the exponential weight @xmath94 ( section [ recurrence ] ) ; * as the self - similar solution of an inviscid burgers equation ( section [ ibe ] ) ; * in terms of the endpoints of the support for the equilibrium measure of the large @xmath0 limit of random hermitian matrices ( section [ z0-eqmeas ] ) .",
    "based on the previous paragraphs , there are several ways in which we can talk about the generating functions in the genus expansion . when we want to think of them directly as functions of the coupling parameter we will write @xmath7 or equivalently @xmath95 ( assuming , when we do this , that @xmath57 ) .",
    "when thinking of its structure as a function of @xmath8 we will write @xmath96 or , sometimes , @xmath97 . finally the two perspectives are related by @xmath98 .",
    "similar conventions will apply to related expansion coefficients such as the @xmath99 first described in section [ recurrence ] .      the first steps toward elucidating the structure of the generating functions @xmath7 were taken in @xcite .",
    "there , differential equations for these functions were derived that made it in principle possible to recursively solve for the @xmath6 in terms of a distinguished combinatorial generating function denoted @xmath87 .",
    "the differential equations in question will be reviewed in section [ background ] , but we want first to give a brief overview of the results of this paper and how they depend on prior work .",
    "we begin with our first description of the fundamental analytic function @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath100    ( section [ ibe ] explains where this expansion comes from . )",
    "when @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the @xmath103 catalan number . for general @xmath41",
    "these are the _ generalized catalan numbers _ which play a role in a wide variety of enumerative combinatorial problems . for a discussion of these applications",
    "see @xcite .      in @xcite the first few coefficients of ( [ i.002 ] ) were calculated explicitly : @xmath104    the expression for @xmath105 given in @xcite contained additional terms involving possible constants of integration .",
    "the authors were able to rule out the presence of these other terms for most , but not all , values of @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is a consequence of the results presented here ( theorem [ egratl ] ) that these terms are absent for all values of @xmath41 and hence the expression for @xmath105 given above is universally valid .",
    "@xmath67    there are several striking features common to these first few coefficients .",
    "first , they are all _ abelian _ functions of the single variable @xmath8 .",
    "( an abelian function is a function that can be represented as an iterated path integral of a rational function .",
    "the rational functions are a minimal subclass of the class of abelian functions . )",
    "second , the singularities of these functions are restricted to @xmath106 .",
    "third , the coefficients of these generating functions can be determined by substitution of the generating function for the higher catalan numbers , @xmath87 , into these abelian functions .    finally ,",
    "although the coefficients of these representations do depend ( rationally over @xmath107 ) on @xmath41 , they have a universal character ; in particular , one should note that knowledge of the coefficients for relatively few values of @xmath41 suffices to completely determine these functions for all values of @xmath41 .",
    "the four above - stated features were established in @xcite ( see theorem [ emp ] of this paper ) to hold for all the genus expansion coefficients .",
    "but we will show that the coefficients , @xmath6 , are even more tightly structured than these properties might suggest :      [ egratl ] for @xmath9 the coefficients of ( [ i.002 ] ) are rational functions of @xmath8 of the form @xmath108 where @xmath90 is a polynomial of degree @xmath91 whose coefficients are rational functions of @xmath41 over the rational numbers @xmath107 . the exponent @xmath92 and the degree @xmath91 are non - negative integers to be determined .",
    "once the rational expression for @xmath6 has been determined , the map counts @xmath109 may be read off directly by methods of classical function theory .",
    "this will be demonstrated for a related counting problem in section [ counts ] .",
    "more could undoubtedly be said about the structure of the @xmath6 , but that will be developed elsewhere .",
    "we turn next to a related map enumeration problem which also has applications to the theory of orthogonal polynomials with exponential weights .",
    "let @xmath110 denote the @xmath13 monic orthogonal polynomial with respect to the exponential weight @xmath111 .",
    "these polynomials satisfy a three - term recurrence relation of the form @xmath112 further background on these orthogonal polynomials and their relation to the partition functions ( [ i.001 ] ) is presented in the appendix .    in @xcite it was shown that , as a consequence of theorem [ eqmsthm ] ,    @xcite [ ii.002 ] the recurrence coefficients for the monic orthogonal polynomials with weight @xmath94 have a full asymptotic expansion , uniformly valid for @xmath113 and @xmath44 in a neighborhood , @xmath56 , of @xmath57 , of the form @xmath114 where @xmath115 ( see section [ fs ] for the explanation of this scaling ) and @xmath116    this result gives us our second interpretation of @xmath8 : it is the leading order term in the large @xmath0 expansion of the recurrence coefficient @xmath117 . the fact that this leading coefficient does indeed coincide with ( [ z0 ] ) follows from the derivation that will be reviewed in section [ ibe ] .",

    "<S> this paper develops a deeper understanding of the structure and combinatorial significance of the partition function for hermitian random matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients of the large @xmath0 expansion of the logarithm of this partition function , also known as the _ genus expansion _ , </S>",
    "<S> ( and its derivatives ) are generating functions for a variety of graphical enumeration problems . </S>",
    "<S> the main results are to prove that these generating functions are in fact specific rational functions of a distinguished irrational ( algebraic ) function , @xmath1 , of the generating function parameter , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this distinguished function is itself the generating function for the catalan numbers ( or generalized catalan numbers , depending on the choice of weight of the parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is also a solution of the inviscid burgers equation for certain initial data . </S>",
    "<S> the shock formation , or _ </S>",
    "<S> caustic _ </S>",
    "<S> , of the burgers characteristic solution is directly related to the poles of the rational forms of the generating functions .    as an intriguing application , </S>",
    "<S> one gains new insights into the relation between certain derivatives of the genus expansion , in a _ double - scaling limit _ , and the asymptotic expansion of the first painlev transcendent . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a precise expression of the painlev asymptotic coefficients directly in terms of the coefficients of the partial fractions expansion of the rational form of the generating functions established in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these insights point toward a more general program relating the first painlev hierarchy to the higher order structure of the double - scaling limit through the specific rational structure of generating functions in the genus expansion . </S>",
    "<S> the paper closes with a discussion of the relation of this work to recent developments in understanding the asymptotics of graphical enumeration .    as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> , these results also yield new information about the asymptotics of recurrence coefficients for orthogonal polynomials with respect to exponential weights , the calculation of correlation functions for certain tied random walks on a 1-d lattice , and the _ large time _ asymptotics of random matrix partition functions . </S>"
