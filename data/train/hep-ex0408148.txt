    "the anomalous @xmath27-value of the electron and muon , @xmath29 and @xmath3 , played an important role in the development of particle physics and continue to serve as fundamental quantities for testing the validity of the standard model and putting stringent constraints on speculative theories beyond the standard model .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is measured to the precision of 4 parts per billion ( ppb ) .",
    "this value is currently the most precise measurement of fine structure constant @xmath30 .    for the muon , because the muon mass @xmath31 is larger than the electron mass @xmath32 , the contribution to @xmath3 from heavier particles such as hadrons or weak vector bosons through virtual processes is greater than that to @xmath29 typically by a factor of @xmath33 .",
    "this sensitivity enhancement of @xmath3 applies generally also for postulated new particles such as supersymmetric particles .",
    "hence , the measurement of @xmath7 provides us more information than that of @xmath29 though @xmath7 is less well known than @xmath29 .",

    "more than 120 probes are used in the analysis because of their good qualities .",
    "the average measurements from those fixed probes during the trolley run is calibrated with respect to the trolley measurements .",
    "the muon distribution is taken into account by using the field value at the center of the muon distribution .",
    "the radial muon distribution is measured by fast rotation with uncertainty of 1  mm .",
    "the vertical muon distribution is symetric around the central plane determined by electric quadruples , and the uncertainty is 2  mm .",
    "the contributions to the total systematic error from different sources are given in table  [ tb : berror ] for 2001 run . and",

    "however , the leading order of hadronic contribution @xmath99@xcite can be determined directly from the annihilation of @xmath5 to hadrons through a dispersion integal @xmath100 in which @xmath101 is the energy in the center of mass frame , @xmath102 is a kinematic factor and @xmath103 the value @xmath104 can be indirectly determined using data from hadronic @xmath6 decays , the conserved vector current hypothesis , plus the appropriate isospin correction . in principle , the large statistics of @xmath6 decay data could improve the precision of @xmath7(had ) .",
