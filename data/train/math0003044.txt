    "this work was motivated by the paper of shkalikov @xcite concerning the analysis of the semi - classical airy operator , together with our computer simulations of the associated discrete problem using the numerical package matlab . specifically , we examined the operator @xmath0 given formally by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and both @xmath3 , @xmath4 are small .",
    "in @xcite it is shown rigorously that as @xmath5 the spectrum of @xmath6 becomes dense inside an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the y - shaped subset of @xmath7 defined by @xmath8,[-i,1/\\sqrt{3}]\\qquad\\mbox { and   } \\qquad [ 1/\\sqrt{3},\\infty),\\ ] ] where we use @xmath9 $ ] to denote the line segment joining @xmath10 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this paper confirms our surprising numerical results , which suggested that when an arbitrarily small jump discontinuity is inserted into the otherwise linear ( purely imaginary ) potential , and then the semi - classical parameter @xmath11 allowed to go to @xmath12 , the asymptotic spectrum of @xmath0 turns out to be completely different from that of @xmath6 ( see figure 1 and corollary [ c1 ] ) .",
    "several papers @xcite have been written about the operator @xmath6 - a major motivation being that it is a model operator for the ` orr - sommerfeld ' problem @xcite .",
    "the operator also defines the ` squire model for the couette flow ' in hydrodynamics ; and in its own right , defines the semigroup which is the solution of the so - called ` torrey equation ' @xcite , related to the diffusion of magnetic fields .",
    "thus , although the spectrum of this non - self - adjoint operator displays sometimes strange and singular behaviour , it must not be dismissed as a ` pathological ' example from pure mathematics since it has important applications - for example , in magnetic resonance imaging devices .",
    "it is well known that a basis for solutions of the so - called ` airy equation ' @xmath13 is given by any two of the airy functions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the analytic investigation of the eigenvalues will involve examining the asymptotic behaviour of certain airy functions , where the expressions we use are wkb - type approximations .",
    "we will show that the eigenvalues lie inside a certain subset of the complex plane , which is intimately related to the @xmath17 @xmath18 ( or @xmath19 @xmath20 ) of the problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proof will depend upon showing that for all @xmath21 outside this subset , the eigenvalue problem @xmath22 has a well - defined green s function . as in @xcite ,",
    "our analysis uses the concept of the @xmath23 @xmath24 which we will describe in section [ s1 ] .",
    "in section [ s2 ] we analyse the spectral behaviour in the semi - classical limit @xmath5 for a general complex - valued , piecewise linear potential .",
    "the surprising result is that each linear segment of the potential gives rise to a characteristic ` y - shaped ' set of eigenvalues ; and the spectrum of the operator is contained within the superposition of these ` y - shaped ' sets . from the point of view of applications",
    ", this means that whilst the asymptotic spectrum is theoretically computable for an idealised linear potential ; in practice , any @xmath25 small deviation from the ideal can @xmath26 change the spectrum .",
    "one way of expressing this for an operator @xmath27 is in terms of the @xmath28 @xmath29 : @xmath30 i.e. the contour sets of the resolvent norm , with the convention that @xmath31 implies @xmath32 for many non - self - adjoint operators it has been demonstrated @xcite that the pseudospectral sets become very large as some parameter varies , even though @xmath33 may be far from the spectrum of the operator .",
    "this is equivalent to saying that the spectrum is computationally unstable .",
    "our aim in this paper is to demonstrate for a relatively transparent case , the mechanism behind this phenomenon ; we believe the results to be capable of extension to a more general class of piecewise analytic potentials .",
    "in section [ s3 ] we provide an analysis of the simultaneous limit as @xmath5 and @xmath34 together .",
    "in this section we describe the characteristic determinant of the operator @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 acting on @xmath37 with dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath4 small , and @xmath38 the complex valued , @xmath39-times piecewise linear function @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and the @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 complex constants .",
    "the domain of the operator is given precisely by @xmath45:f(-1)=f(1)=0,f'\\in c[-1,1 ] \\mbox { and } f''\\in l^2(-1,1)\\}\\ ] ] where the primes @xmath46 denote differentiation with respect to @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is initially to be interpreted in the distributional sense .",
    "a direct substitution shows that a basis of solutions for the differential equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 ; and @xmath51 , @xmath52 are complex constants , is given by any two of the airy functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 it follows that , in order to construct an eigenfunction of the operator @xmath35 , we seek constants @xmath56 @xmath44 such that the function @xmath57 satisfies all of the domain conditions ( [ boundconds1 ] ) , where    @xmath58    with @xmath59 . for each @xmath44 , the functions @xmath60 are defined similarly , except that a different choice of @xmath61 is to be taken from @xmath62 .",
    "in addition to satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath63 , @xmath64 must also be continuously differentiable , even at the points @xmath65 . from the power series definition @xcite",
    ", it is clear that the airy functions @xmath66 are analytic on the whole of @xmath7 , and so the requirement that @xmath64 be continuously differentiable reduces to the @xmath67 simultaneous ` matching ' conditions @xmath68 and @xmath69 the boundary conditions @xmath63 demand that @xmath70 and @xmath71 thus finding a solution of the differential equation @xmath72 which satisfies all of the domain conditions ( [ boundconds1 ] ) , involves solving the matrix equation @xmath73 @xmath74 for the constants @xmath75 note that we are taking the left- and right - hand limits at the points @xmath65 , although here and subsequently we will abuse the notation in order to add clarity , and simply write @xmath76 etc .",
    "it is the determinant of the matrix on the left - hand side of ( [ matrix1 ] ) that we shall call the characteristic determinant of the eigenvalue problem defined by @xmath35 .",
    "for our proofs in the next section , we will need some notation and basic properties of the airy functions . in all that follows we",
    "let the argument function @xmath77 take principal values i.e. @xmath78.\\ ] ] if @xmath79 , the subsets @xmath80 of @xmath7 are to be constructed as follows : take the lines @xmath81 as @xmath82 ranges in @xmath83 , to their point of intersection , @xmath84 say .",
    "then , from @xmath84 extend the infinite line defined by the set of @xmath85 such that @xmath86 the motivation for this set will become clear during our proofs ; in fact , it will be seen to comprise a curve asymptotic to the line @xmath87 note for now , however , that ( [ equals ] ) is @xmath11-independent .",
    "the @xmath88-neighbourhood of any subset @xmath89 of @xmath7 will be defined by @xmath90 we will use the well - known @xcite asymptotic expansion of the airy function @xmath66 , giving the wkb - type approximation : @xmath91 as @xmath92 , valid for @xmath93 ; and where the principal value of @xmath94 is taken . following the notation of olver ( see @xcite ) , we define @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 ( suffixes enumerated modulo 3 ) .",
    "one can check that for all complex @xmath33 ( and taking principal values ) , we have @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 then , putting @xmath101 the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics1 ] ) show that as @xmath92 , @xmath102 decreases exponentially for @xmath103 , and increases exponentially for @xmath104 .",
    "the boundaries of the sectors @xmath105 i.e. the rays @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 , are known as the stokes lines ( or principal curves ) of the problem @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the airy equation @xmath13 the stokes lines are defined to be the values of @xmath33 such that @xmath109 and denote the boundaries of the @xmath19 @xmath110 @xmath111 etc .",
    ", inside of which the asymptotic expression ( [ asymptotics1 ] ) is valid for each @xmath61 .",
    "we will call the suffix @xmath61 ` allowable ' for any given @xmath112 , if @xmath113",
    "the following is a generalisation of the argument used in @xcite for the potential @xmath114 , and will form a lemma for our main theorem .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath115 be the complex valued linear potential given by @xmath116\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath51 are complex constants ; @xmath117 , @xmath118 are as defined in ( [ defu ] ) , and @xmath119 $ ] , @xmath120 .",
    "let @xmath121 be given and @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath122 then @xmath123 as @xmath5 .    a simple scaling and translation of the operator @xmath35 allows us , without loss of generality , to assume that @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 . that is , we assume @xmath127 by elementary trigonometry , one can check that we then have @xmath128 or @xmath129 recalling our definition of the airy functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 ( [ defu ] ) , we put @xmath130 and can rewrite ( [ asymptotics1 ] ) explicitly in terms of @xmath11 .",
    "then , taking the modulus we obtain @xmath131 @xmath132 as @xmath5 , valid for @xmath133 . therefore , in order to estimate the moduli of the airy functions @xmath134 in the limit @xmath5 , it is sufficient to examine the behaviour of the functions @xmath135 for @xmath136    the basic idea of our proof is to show that for @xmath21 outside an arbitrarily small @xmath88-neighbourhood of @xmath137 , one can assign allowable values of @xmath138 and @xmath61 from @xmath62 ( in the sense of ( [ allowable ] ) ) such that the inequalities @xmath139 and @xmath140 hold in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "this will then be enough , by ( [ asyh ] ) , to ensure that @xmath141 and @xmath142 are of different orders of magnitude as @xmath5 , thus implying ( [ state1 ] ) .    using the statements of the previous section ;",
    "for all values of @xmath21 such that @xmath143 does not lie within an @xmath88-neighbourhood of any of the stokes lines , and @xmath144 , @xmath145 lie in different principal domains , one can always obtain ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , and the asymptotics ( [ asyh ] ) will be valid . however , for @xmath21 lying in the sector having its apex at @xmath84 , and bounded by the rays @xmath146 @xmath147 , it is easy to check that @xmath148 both lie in the same principal domain , for each @xmath59",
    ". then it is also straightforward to check that as @xmath47 ranges from @xmath149 to @xmath150 , the function @xmath151 which has been at the heart of our analysis , has a single maximum / minimum .",
    "together with the identities ( [ id1 ] ) , ( [ id2 ] ) and ( [ id3 ] ) , this means that there @xmath152 be values of @xmath21 such that equality holds in both ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) - no matter what choices of @xmath138 and @xmath61 are made .",
    "thus , ( and without loss of generality assuming @xmath153 , ) the set of @xmath21 satisfying @xmath154 lies in @xmath137 .",
    "we now examine this set in more detail . expanding the taylor series",
    ", we have @xmath155 and @xmath156 as @xmath157 .",
    "dividing through by @xmath158 , this means that ( [ gameq ] ) will hold if and only if @xmath159 as @xmath157 .",
    "putting @xmath160 , this is equivalent to the requirement @xmath161 as @xmath162 .",
    "but then @xmath163 as @xmath162",
    ". by our definition of @xmath84 , @xmath164 lies at the intersection of two stokes lines , and so @xmath165 showing that @xmath84 certainly lies in the set of @xmath21 satisfying ( [ gameq ] ) .",
    "therefore , we deduce that @xmath137 contains a curve from @xmath84 asymptotic to the positive real - axis .    finally , we must examine what happens when @xmath33 does lie on one of the stokes lines .",
    "firstly , suppose @xmath166 , corresponding to @xmath21 lying on the ray centred at @xmath167 and passing through @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath168 are allowable , and one checks that if @xmath21 lies on the segment @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 .",
    "it follows by ( [ id2 ] ) that @xmath171 and so ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) can not hold .",
    "however , if @xmath21 lies on that part of the ray which extends past @xmath84 ( but not @xmath172 itself , ) then @xmath173 , and @xmath174 causing ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) to hold for @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "an entirely similar argument holds when @xmath177 , corresponding to @xmath21 lying on the ray centred at @xmath178 and passing through @xmath84 using ( [ id1 ] ) , with @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "finally , the case where @xmath181 is taken care of using ( [ id3 ] ) , which shows that we may use allowable values @xmath149 and @xmath12 to obtain ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .    in the case @xmath182 ; @xmath183 lies on the real - axis , and the figure @xmath184 has three @xmath185 ` arms ' .",
    "when @xmath186 , the symmetric case , @xmath187 is the semi - infinite interval @xmath188 , as is well - known from the theory of self - adjoint operators .",
    "we now give our main result .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath36 act on @xmath37 with dirichlet boundary conditions , where @xmath4 is small , and @xmath38 is the complex valued n - times piecewise linear function @xmath40 with @xmath189 and the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 complex constants .",
    "we assume for each @xmath190 that if @xmath191 , then @xmath192 .",
    "put @xmath193 , and , using our earlier notation @xmath194 let @xmath121 and @xmath195 be given .",
    "then @xmath196 for all small enough @xmath4 .",
    "our proof involves an analysis of the behaviour of the characteristic - determinant , i.e. the left - hand side of ( [ matrix1 ] ) , as @xmath5 .",
    "we give a proof for the case @xmath197 ; the general case follows by a similar argument . for @xmath197 ,",
    "the characteristic - determinant is given by @xmath198 and we must prove that for certain values of @xmath85 , this determinant does not vanish as @xmath5 .",

    "now , let @xmath121 and @xmath195 be as given in the statement of the theorem .",
    "taking any @xmath207 we can use the results of proposition [ t2 ] to show that ( [ chardet1 ] ) is non - zero in the limit as @xmath5 . indeed , by the proof of proposition [ t2 ] , we can ensure that the asymptotic estimates @xmath208 @xmath209and @xmath210 hold , as @xmath5 .",
    "then , using the standard asymptotic expansions of the airy functions @xcite , which give @xmath211 and @xmath212 as @xmath92 , valid for all @xmath33 such that @xmath93 ; we see that , if @xmath213 then @xmath214 as @xmath92 . comparing this last expression with ( [ asymptotics ] ) , and using @xmath215 to mean that @xmath216 we obtain @xmath217 moreover ,",

    "similar estimates apply to each of the remaining three terms in ( [ chardet2 ] ) i.e. @xmath231 @xmath232 @xmath233(u_{11}(-1)u_{12}(x_1)u_{22}(x_1 ) u_{21}(x_2)u_{31}(1)u_{32}(x_2)),\\ ] ]    @xmath234 @xmath232 @xmath235(u_{11}(-1)u_{12}(x_1)u_{22}(x_1 ) u_{21}(x_2)u_{31}(1)u_{32}(x_2))\\]]and @xmath236 @xmath229 @xmath237(u_{11}(-1)u_{12}(x_1)u_{22}(x_1 ) u_{21}(x_2)u_{31}(1)u_{32}(x_2))\\ ] ] as @xmath5 . collecting these estimates together",
    ", we see that the characteristic determinant ( [ chardet1 ] ) tends asymptotically towards @xmath238 as @xmath5 . the airy functions @xmath14 have countably many negative real zeros , @xcite ; and so by our choice of @xmath21 outside @xmath239 together with the proof of proposition [ t2 ]",
    ", we are assured that none of the airy functions @xmath223 vanishes .",
    "therefore , the determinant ( [ chardet1 ] ) does not vanish in the limit as @xmath5 , provided the ` constant ' terms @xmath240 our choice of @xmath21 ensures that each of the individual constant terms @xmath220 is non - zero .",
    "moreover , reviewing the proof of proposition [ t2 ] and the identities ( [ id1])-([id3 ] ) , we see that the choices for @xmath138 and @xmath61 are not uniquely determined .",
    "therefore , it is always possible to ensure that ( [ eqncon ] ) holds , even when @xmath115 is continuous at some or all of the @xmath241 .",
    "for example , if it happens that @xmath242 , then we choose @xmath138 and @xmath61 so that the constants @xmath243 and @xmath244 take different signs ( by the calculations immediately above ( [ sim1 ] ) ) . thus , we deduce that such @xmath21 can not be an eigenvalue .",
    "it now just requires the following compactness argument to complete the proof .",
    "let @xmath245 denote the open ball centred at @xmath33 , with radius @xmath88 .",
    "our argument so far shows that for any @xmath246 such that @xmath247 we have @xmath248 for all @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is some positive constant dependent upon @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath251 so that @xmath252 is compact .",
    "then for all @xmath253 @xmath254 and so @xmath255 but by compactness this means that there exists a finite sub - covering @xmath256 taking @xmath257 to be @xmath258 , we deduce that for all @xmath259 we have @xmath260 and this is equivalent to the statement of the theorem .",
    "an important but subtle point , to note is that the zeros of @xmath261 as a function of @xmath21 , are @xmath262 the same as the zeros of ( [ chardet1 ] ) .",
    "however , by a similar argument to that of shkalikov @xcite ( i.e. using ( [ asymptotics ] ) ) , one can readily show that along each of the bounded arms of the y - shaped figures making up @xmath89 , the zeros ( eigenvalues ) do converge as @xmath5 to form a dense set .",
    "finding an asymptotic expression for the density of spectral points along the infinite lines ( in the direction of the positive real - axis ) appears to be a much more difficult problem ; and we have no results yet in that direction .    to illustrate theorem [ t1 ] , in figure 3 we show a matlab plot of the discretised version of the problem where the potential @xmath263    we now return to the operator @xmath0 defined in the first section .",
    "[ c1 ] let @xmath0 be the non - self - adjoint operator defined by @xmath264 acting on @xmath37 with dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath4 , and @xmath265 with @xmath3 .",
