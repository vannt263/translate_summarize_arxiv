    "this section has two purposes .",
    "firstly , we review some well - known phenomena in order to motivate subsequent developments . after that",
    ", we provide a background of the phenomena with some notation , terminology and notions .",
    "_ * volatility smiles . * _ in a nutshell , vanilla options with different maturities and strikes have different volatilities implied by the well - known formula of @xcite . implied volatility is quoted as the market expectation about the average future volatility of the underlying asset over the remaining life of the option . thus compared to historical volatility it is the forward looking approach .    for many years",
    ", practitioners and academics have tried to analyse the volatility smile phenomenon and understand its implications for derivatives pricing and risk management . in @xcite , their link between the real - world and risk - neutral processes of the underlying would be complete by non - traded sources of risk .",
    "@xcite found that the dynamics of the risk premium , when volatility is stochastic , is not a traded security . a number of models and extensions of , or alternatives to , the black - scholes model , have been proposed in the literature : the local volatility models of @xcite , @xcite ; a jump - diffusion model of @xcite ; stochastic volatility models of @xcite , @xcite and others ; mixed stochastic jump - diffusion models of @xcite and others ; universal volatility models of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others ; regime switching models , etc .    from a hedging perspective",
    ", traders who use the black - scholes model must continuously change the volatility assumption in order to match market prices .",
    "their hedge ratios change accordingly in an uncontrolled way : the models listed above bring some order into this chaos . in the course of time , the general consensus , as advocated by practitioners and academics , is to _ choose _ a model that produces hedging strategies for both vanilla and exotic options resulting in profit and loss distributions that are sharply peaked at zero .",
    "we argue that such a model , if recovered ( or implied ) from option prices , by no means nearly explains this phenomenon , but is a means only to describe the implied volatility surface .    _",
    "* convexity adjustments . *",
    "_ one of many well - known adjustments is the convexity adjustment - the implied yield of a futures and the equivalent forward rate agreement contracts are different .",
    "this phenomenon implies that market participants need to be paid more ( or less ) premium .",
    "the common approach , as used by most practitioners and academics , is to adjust futures quotes such that they can be used as forward rates .",
    "naturally , this approach depends on an model that is used for this purpose . for the extended vasicek known as @xcite and @xcite model ,",
    "explicit formulae can be derived .",
    "the situation is different for models whose continuous description gives the short rate a log - normal distribution such as the @xcite and @xcite models : for these , in their analytical form of continuous evolution , futures prices can be shown to be positively infinite @xcite and @xcite . in subsequent developments ,",
    "we shall offer a different approach to this phenomenon .",
    "_ * parallel derivative markets .",
    "* _ in an economic system , a financial market consists of a risk - free money account , _ primary _ and _ parallel _ markets .",
    "examples of primary markets are stocks and bonds , and examples of parallel markets are derivatives such as forward , futures , vanilla options , credits which are derived from the same primary asset .",
    "market makers can trade and make prices for derivatives in a parallel market without references to another .",
    "the framework is as follows : a complete probability space @xmath0 with a filtration @xmath1 satisfying the usual conditions of right - continuity and completeness .",
    "@xmath2 denotes a fixed and finite time horizon ; furthermore , we assume that @xmath3 is trivial and that @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a continuous semimartingale representing the price process of a risky asset .",
    "the absence of arbitrage opportunities implies the existence of an probability measure @xmath6 equivalent to the probability measure @xmath7 ( the real world probability ) , such that @xmath8 is a @xmath6-martingale .",
    "denote by @xmath9 the set of coexistent equivalent measures @xmath6 .",
    "a financial market is considered such that @xmath10 .",
    "uniqueness of the equivalent probability measure @xmath6 implies the market is _",
    "complete_. the fundamental theorem of asset pricing establishes the relationship between the absence of arbitrage opportunities and the existence of an equivalent martingale measure and in a basic framework was proved by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the modern version of this theorem , established by @xcite , states that the absence of arbitrage opportunities is  essentially \" equivalent to the existence of an equivalent martingale measure under which the discounted ( primary asset ) price process is a martingale .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider only one horizon of uncertainty @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "a _ contingent claim _ , or a _ derivative _",
    ", @xmath12 is a payoff at time @xmath13 , contingent on the scenario @xmath14 .",
    "the derivative has the special form @xmath15 for some function @xmath16 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 is referred to as the primary ( or the ` underlying ' ) .",
    "more generally , @xmath17 depends on the whole evolution of @xmath8 up to time @xmath13 and is a random variable @xmath18    in financial terms , every contingent claim can be replicated by means of a _ trading strategy _ ( or interchangeably known as _ hedging strategy _ or a _ replication portfolio _ ) which is a portfolio consisting of the primary asset @xmath8 and a risk - free money account @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be a predictable process and an adapted process , respectively . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the amounts of asset and money account , respectively , held at time @xmath24 . in this section , for ease of exposition , we assume that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "the _ value _ of the portfolio at time @xmath24 is given by @xmath27 for @xmath26 .",
    "it can be shown that the trading strategy @xmath28 is _ admissible _ such that the value process @xmath29 is square - integrable and have right - continuous paths and is defined by @xmath30 for @xmath26 . for @xmath6-almost surely , every contingent claim @xmath17 is attainable and admits the following representation @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] . moreover , the strategy is _ self - financing _ , that is the cost of the portfolio ( also known as derivative price ) is a constant @xmath33 @xmath34 the constant value @xmath33 represents a perfect replication or a _",
    "perfect hedge_.    thus far , we have presented the well - known mathematical construction of a hedging strategy in a complete market where every contingent claim is attainable . in a complete market ,",
    "derivative prices are unique - no arbitrage opportunities exist .",
    "derivatives can not be valuated in a parallel market at any price other than @xmath33 .    from financial and economic point of view",
    ", the phenomena imply that the market is _ incomplete _ , arbitrage opportunities exist and may not be at all eliminated .",
    "a derivative can be valued at different prices and hedged by mutually exclusively trading in risky assets ( or derivatives ) in parallel markets where market makers engage in market activities : investments , speculative trading , hedging , arbitrage and risk management .",
    "in addition , market makers expose themselves to market conditions such as liquidity , see for instance @xcite .",
    "we argue that exposure to the variability of market activities , market conditions and generally to uncertain future events constitutes a basis of arbitrage opportunity which we shall call _ intrinsic risk_.    in general , market incompleteness is a principle under which every contingent claim bears intrinsic risks . let us postulate an assumption as a basis for subsequent reasonings and discussions .",
    "+ * assumption .",
    "* _ the market is incomplete and there exist intrinsic risks embedded in every contingent claim . _",
    "+ while the assumption is theoretical , it is rather realistically a proposition with the phenomena as proof .",
    "in a mathematical context , let @xmath35 be the set of all intrinsic risks , that is the set of all real valued functions on @xmath36 .",
    "denote by @xmath37 the measure to the intrinsic risk @xmath38 on the scenario @xmath14 . as a measure of intrinsic risk",
    ", @xmath39 is a mapping from @xmath35 into @xmath40 . as a basic object of our study",
    ", @xmath39 shall therefore be the random variable on the set of states of nature at a future date @xmath13 .",
    "generally , @xmath39 depends on the evolution of the primary asset up to time @xmath13 and may also depend on the contingent claim : @xmath41 the superscript indicates the dependence of a particular contingent claim @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to a new representation of @xmath17 @xmath42 we now introduce the kunita - watanabe decomposition @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a square - integrable martingale orthogonal to @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 . this representation of @xmath17",
    "have been extensively dealt with , see for example @xcite . by incompleteness , the derivative value @xmath48 represents a perfect hedge , which manifests an initial intrinsic value of risk @xmath49 . in relation to the hedging strategy",
    "( [ hgrepresenttation ] ) , the measure of intrinsic risk shall be considered as the value of all possible future capital which , required to control the risk incurred by the market maker ( such as hedger ) and invested in the primary asset , makes not only the contingent claim acceptable , but its valuation fair .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", market incompleteness implies that there exists in the set @xmath9 an equivalent measure , not necessarily a martingale and/or unique measure , that is assigned to a parallel market .",
    "thus , intrinsic risk may depend on the derivative and is not necessarily unique , as such its measure takes many forms some of which we shall consider for applications . in the remaining of this paper , we shall not discuss further on the abstract representations ( [ hgrepresenttation ] ) and ( [ hrep ] ) , but present them in a more descriptive ( down to earth ) framework - the continuous time framework .",
    "in this section we propose a continuous time financial market consisting of a primary price process @xmath8 and a risk - free money account @xmath50 .",
    "we shall define a measure of intrinsic risk and show that perfect hedging strategies can be constructed .",
    "we also show that the existence of intrinsic risk provides an internal consistency in pricing and hedging a contingent claim .",
    "let @xmath51 be a brownian motion on the complete probability space @xmath0 .",
    "the underlying price process of @xmath8 satisfies the sde @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are lipschitz continuous functions so that a solution exists .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 can be functions of @xmath8 .",
    "the price process of @xmath50 is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a lipschitz continuous function .",
    "we expand the portfolio value process ( [ portvalue ] ) as follows : @xmath59\\nonumber \\\\          & = & \\nu(t)v(t)dt + \\alpha(t)\\sigma(t)x(t ) dw(t),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a @xmath6-brownian motion and is defined by @xmath61 and @xmath62 here , @xmath6 is some martingale measure .",
    "indeed , the theory of the girsanov change of measure , see for example @xcite , shows that there exists such a martingale measure @xmath6 equivalent to @xmath7 and which excludes arbitrage opportunities .",
    "more precisely , there exists a probability measure @xmath63 such that @xmath64 and @xmath8 is a @xmath6-martingale .",

    "it is important to note that in the risk - neutral world the essential theoretical assumptions are : ( 1 ) the _ true _ price process ( [ xpsde ] ) is correctly specified and ( 2 ) prices of derivatives @xmath17 are drawn from this price process , that is derivative prices are uniquely determined by formula ( [ qvalformula ] ) .",
    "these assumptions , if not violated , lead to a complete market and the trading strategy ( [ qhedgestrat ] ) and the measure @xmath6 are unique .",
    "however , in practice as we argued earlier , these assumptions are strongly violated ; as a result market completeness and uniqueness of derivative prices are no longer valid .",
    "that is @xmath6 is no longer risk - neutral , but only an equivalent measure in the set @xmath9 .",
    "we now consider the representation ( [ hgrepresenttation ] ) in a continuous time framework , the measure of intrinsic risk can be defined , without loss of generality , in terms of changes in values in a future time interval @xmath71 $ ] as follows .    * definition . *",

    "thus , @xmath79 .",
    "analogously , @xmath80 is defined as an _ intrinsic price of risk_.    under @xmath77 measure , the price process of @xmath8 under @xmath77 is given by @xmath81 consequently the fair value of a contingent claim is given by the formula @xmath82",

    "\\frac{1}{d(t)}h(x(t ) ) \\right| \\mathcal{f}(t ) \\right].\\ ] ]    from a pragmatic standpoint , what is needed in determining prices of derivatives and managing their risks is to allow sources of uncertainty that are epistemic ( or subjective ) rather than aleatory in nature . in theory , the value of a derivative can be perfectly replicated by a combination of other derivatives provided that these derivatives are uniquely determined by the formula ( [ qvalformula ] ) .",
    "in practice , prices of derivatives ( such as futures , vanilla options ) on the same primary asset are not determined by ( [ qvalformula ] ) from statistically or econometrically observed model ( [ xpsde ] ) , but made by individual market makers who , with little , if not at all , knowledge of the _ true _ price process , have used their personal perception of the future .",
    "we argue further on this point as follows .",
    "if we let @xmath83 be the price process of a derivative in a derivative market ( such as futures in particular , @xmath84 $ ] , since its contract is not necessarily connected with a physical primary asset ) , @xmath85 must have an abstract dynamics and is assumed to satisfy a sde @xmath86 where @xmath13 denotes a fixed time horizon larger than or equal to the maturity of any contingent claim , @xmath87 is a lipschitz continuous function so that a solution exists .",
    "we now show that @xmath88 is a @xmath77-brownian motion - the source of randomness that drives the derivative price process @xmath85 .",
    "we introduce a change of time , see for example @xcite .",
    "let @xmath89 be a positive function such that @xmath90 which is finite for finite time @xmath91 and increases almost surely .",
    "define @xmath92 , let @xmath85 be a replacement of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath93 whose solution is given by @xmath94 with @xmath95 . rearranging the drift term leads to @xmath96 where @xmath97 here , we see the concurrence of the sdes ( [ xosde ] ) and ( [ yosde ] ) , the source of randomness @xmath88 is the very @xmath77-brownian motion ( [ zobrownian ] ) .",
    "we have just shown that the measure @xmath77 is subjective in the sense that the valuation of a contingent claim is not only subjected to the dynamics of the primary asset price , but also subject to an exogenous measure of risk @xmath98 .",
    "we shall call the measure @xmath77 the _ risk - subjective measure_. the connection between the risk - subjective measure and the risk - neutral measure described by ( [ zobrownian ] ) is far more precise than that found in @xcite .    an important note here is that the trading strategy ( [ oportmod ] ) is equivalent to the risk - free money account , that is the growth of portfolio value ( [ portvalue ] ) is at the risk - free rate @xmath99 . in terms of pricing and hedging , the presence of intrinsic risk",
    "imposes an internal consistency and implies that possible arbitrage exists in the market ( the primary market and its associated derivative markets ) .",
    "in this section , we shall first discuss some problems related to asset models in parallel markets so as to provide some background for subsequent applications .    in the light of intrinsic risk ,",
    "the sde ( [ yqsde ] ) in reality may represent a risky asset price process in parallel markets such as : ( 1 ) futures price process , or ( 2 ) an implied price process recovered from option prices where @xmath87 is the implied volatility .",
    "attempts of recovering the implied price process were pioneered , for examples , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "market makers indeed have dispensed with the correct specification ( [ xpsde ] ) and directly use an implied price process as a tool to prescribe the dynamics of the implied volatility surface .",
    "a practice of recovering an implied price process from observed derivative prices ( such as vanilla option prices ) and use it to price derivatives is known as _",
    "instrumental approach _",
    ", described in @xcite . a practical point that is more pertinent to the instrumental approach",
    "is that the prices of exotic derivatives are given by the price dynamics that can take into account or recover the volatility smile . with reference to intrinsic risk ,",
    "an implied price process is a mis - specification for the primary asset , this was discussed in @xcite and was shown that successful hedging depends entirely on the relationship between the mis - specified volatility @xmath87 and the true local volatility @xmath56 , and the total hedging error is given by , assuming zero risk - free rate , @xmath100 note that this hedge error resembles the term ( [ zetatimechge ] ) .",
    "clearly , the hedging error is an intrinsic price of risk presented as traded asset in the hedging strategy ( [ oportmod ] ) , but not in ( [ qhedgestrat ] ) .",
    "before we illustrate a number of applications for pricing and hedging with specific form of the measure of intrinsic risk , let us state a general result for derivative valuation .",
    "we have established the risk - subjective valuation formula ( [ ovalformula ] ) where the risk - subjective price process is given by ( [ xosde ] ) .",
    "the risk - subjective value @xmath101 of a contingent claim @xmath15 given by @xmath102\\ ] ] is a unique solution to @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the result is obtained by directly applying the feynman - kac formula .",
    "we have shown that the trading strategy ( [ oportmod ] ) yields the risk - free rate of return on the value of a derivative , and also the intrinsic risk is perfectly hedged by delta - hedging representation ( [ hrep ] ) .      as unpredictable as a market , prices in a parallel market ( such as futures and corresponding vanilla options )",
    "may not be driven by the same source of randomness that drives the primary asset ( such as stock and bond ) .",
    "motivated by results ( [ zetatimechge ] ) and ( [ hedgeerror ] ) , in the present framework it makes sense to formulate @xmath98 by an abstract form @xmath106 where @xmath56 is the volatility of the underlying asset , @xmath87 the volatility of a risky asset in a parallel market .",
    "we propose that @xmath98 takes a general form of an exponential family @xmath107 the parameter @xmath108 and @xmath104 . as a result ,",
    "( [ speczeta ] ) is a special case .",
    "+ _ remark .",
    "_ while the diffusion term @xmath56 accounts for the distributional property of the primary asset price , the exogenous term @xmath98 accounts for a phenomenon such as volatility smile .",
    "the existence of intrinsic risk appears to undermine the true probability distribution of the underlying , however it emphasises its important role in determining the values of derivatives .",
    "it ensures maximal consistency in pricing and hedging contingent claims that are path - dependent / independent and particularly derivatives on volatility ( such as variance swap , volatility swap ) .",
    "it insists on a realistic dynamics for the underlying asset as far as delta - hedge is concerned .      in practice , forward contracts",
    "are necessarily associated with the primary asset ( such as stock and bond ) and therefore their prices are determined by ( [ qvalformula ] ) and hedged by ( [ qhedgestrat ] ) . as was illustrated in the previous section , can be determined by ( [ ovalformula ] ) which includes a measure of intrinsic risk , @xmath98 , as a convexity adjustment .",
    "hedgers holding the primary asset in their hedging portfolio would receive dividends which are assumed to be a continuous stream of payments , whereas hedgers holding other hedge instruments ( such as futures , vanilla options ) do not receive dividends . in this case",
    ", @xmath98 can be considered as dividend yield and @xmath109 is the amount of dividend received in a time interval @xmath72 . @xmath98 may also be a non - negative function representing the hazard rate of default in a time interval @xmath72 , this well - known approach was proposed in @xcite and references therein .",
    "suppose that @xmath110 is the risk - free rate of return of a foreign money account and @xmath111 the measure of risk that accounts for volatility smile , ( [ risksubjectivepde ] ) is then a direct application to foreign market derivatives where @xmath112 .",
    "this is indeed the simplest application of risk - subjective valuation .      as an exogenous variable to the risk - subjective price process",
    "( [ xosde ] ) , @xmath98 of a particular form would become a mean of reversion .",
    "this is a desirable feature in a number of well - known interest rate models such as extended model of @xcite , @xcite model .",
    "with reference to the _ liquidity preference theory _ or the _ preferred habitat theory _ of @xcite , a term premium for a bond can be represented as a measure of intrinsic risk .",
    "it is well - known among both academic and practitioners that the standard complete market framework often failed , see for example @xcite",
    ". incomplete market framework becomes crucial in understanding and explaining well - known market anomalies . in this article",
    "we have introduced the notion of intrinsic risk and derived the risk - subjective measure @xmath77 equivalent to the real - world measure @xmath7 , where @xmath113 . at a conceptual level",
    ", the theory of girsanov change of measure allows us to recognise that the crucial role of @xmath77 , rather than the expectation @xmath114 $ ] , is assigned to the price of a derivative ( such as futures , vanilla option ) .",
    "in addition , the intrinsic risk as a structure is what needed to be imposed on the mutual movements of the primary and derivative markets so that , at least , the pricing and hedging derivatives ( such as swaps and caplets ) can be undertaken on a consistent basis .",
    "apart from such conceptual aspect , the measure @xmath77 does not undermine the role of the measure @xmath7 in that a lot of knowledge about the primary market is known at any given time @xmath24 .",
    "more precisely , the market s expectation ( predictions ) in terms of a measure @xmath77 at time @xmath24 is given by the conditional probability distribution @xmath115 \\mbox { on } \\mathcal{f}_{\\mathbb{s}}(t)\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the information available given by the primary market at time @xmath24 , and @xmath117 is the information generated by derivatives ( such as vanilla options ) with maturities @xmath118 .    a final remark : in view of the last financial crises , the market has evolved and there is an apparent need , both among practitioners and in academia , to comprehend the problems caused by an excessive dependence on a specific asset modeling approach , by ambiguous specification of risks and/or by confusions between risks and uncertainties ( volatilities ) . as a result , we presented a continuous time framework that , we believe , brings unity , simplicity and consistency to two important aspects : pricing with correctly specified model for a primary risky asset , and hedging risks that can be correctly understood and specified .",
    "in addition , the framework proposed in this article is rigorous in the sense that the true meanings of properties and relationships of intrinsic risk and volatility are self - consistent such that their values are not arbitrarily assigned nor should their properties be misused by ignorance .",
