    "for an electrochemical adsorption system , the forc method consists of saturating the adsorbate coverage @xmath0 in a strong positive ( for anions ; negative for cations ) electrochemical potential ( proportional to the electrode potential ) and , in each case starting from saturation , decreasing the potential to a series of progressively more negative `` reversal potentials '' @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loop ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the potential is increased back to the saturating value  @xcite .",
    "it is thus a simple generalization of the standard cyclic voltammetry ( cv ) method , in which the negative return potential is decreased for each cycle .",
    "this produces a family of forcs , @xmath2 , where @xmath0 is the adsorbate coverage , and where @xmath3 is the instantaneous potential during the increase back toward saturation . although we shall not discuss this further here , it is of course also possible to fix the negative limiting electrode potential and change the positive return potential from cycle to cycle .",

    "a positive value of @xmath6 indicates that the corresponding reversal curves are converging with increasing @xmath7 , while a negative value indicates divergence",

    "kmc simulations of lattice - gas models , where a monte carlo ( mc ) step corresponds to an attempt to cross a free - energy barrier , have been used to simulate the kinetics of electrochemical systems with discontinuous  @xcite or continuous  @xcite phase transitions in two dimensions .",

    "the sign convention is chosen such that @xmath17 favors adsorption , and negative values of @xmath18 denote repulsion while positive values denote attraction between adsorbate particles on the surface .",
