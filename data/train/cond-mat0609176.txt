    "<S> selecting nanocomposites for photonic switching applications requires optimizing their thermal , nonlinear and two - photon absorption characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we simplify this step by defining a compound figure of merit ( @xmath0 ) for nanocomposites of noble metals in dielectric based on criteria that limit these structures in photonic applications , i.e. thermal heating and two - photon absorption . </S>",
    "<S> the device independent results predict extremely large values of @xmath0 for a specific combination of the metal and insulator dielectric constant given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dielectric constant of the host and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the real and imaginary parts for the metal .    in </S>",
    "<S> recent years considerable research has gone into the study of all - optical switching devices for photonic applications where the requirement of the material had been a large @xmath5 ( nonlinear refractive index ) , low index change due to thermal effects , and small two - photon absorption ( tpa ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , there is significant interest in using nanocomposites comprising of metal nanoparticles in dielectric host for such applications because of their nonlinear response @xcite and because of their potential use in applications below the diffraction limited regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the selection of the metal - host system for a given application must be based on a careful evaluation of the key physical limitations in the interaction of light with matter . in this regard , there are two well accepted limitations . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the refractive index change due to thermal effects arising from light - matter interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second , which has been recognized as the ultimate limit for optical switching , is tpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there has been no effort to combine these effects into a figure of merit describing the metal nanocomposite material in photonic applications involving optical modulation @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we define a compound figure of merit ( @xmath0 ) as the product of the thermal fom ( @xmath6 ) and the tpa fom ( @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for choosing the product as compared to a linear combination comes from the strong correlation between the tpa and thermal effects . in general material </S>",
    "<S> having large tpa show small linear absorption and thermal effects and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is difficult to select materials for such applications based simply on the linear combination of the two effects . </S>",
    "<S> a common example of such a definition is that of the gain - bandwidth product used to optimize an op - amp . </S>",
    "<S> the the theoretical behavior for ag , au and cu nanoparticles embedded in an sio@xmath8 matrix were evaluated based on this @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the @xmath0 , which is device independent , shows that an extremely large value results at a specific combinations of the metal and host dielectric function given by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dielectric constant of the host and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the real and imaginary parts of the the dielectric constant of the metal . </S>",
    "<S> these results could simplify the process of materials selection for nanocomposites in photonic switching applications at desired wavelengths .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the criteria that conventional all - optical switching devices are based on generation of light induced phase shifts of the order of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 for a range of devices . </S>",
    "<S> the design in mind for these calculations is a mach - zehnder interferometer where @xmath12 , and the criterion for switching is given by @xcite:@xmath13    where @xmath14 is the switching intensity , @xmath15 is the length of the device , and @xmath16 is the wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> our first figure of merit requires that the thermal index change be a small fraction of the fast light - induced change ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal index change can be expressed by:@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the thermo - optic coefficient , @xmath20 is the specific heat , @xmath21 is the volume of the material heated by the light , @xmath22 is the density of the material and @xmath23 is the energy absorbed by the material per pulse , which is given by : @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cross sectional area of the device , @xmath26 is the linear absorption coefficient and @xmath27 is the duration of the switching pulse . by using eq . </S>",

    "<S> two - photon absorption can reduce the device throughput even if the linear absorption is small . a general criterion for this </S>",
    "<S> was developed by stegeman and co - workers @xcite based on eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : ppi ] and the two photon absorption coefficient @xmath29 as:@xmath30    based on this , we defined our next figure of merit to be:@xmath31 the behavior of this quantity is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : fomtpa ] to give : @xmath32 _ using this definition , an attractive combination of metal - dielectric would be one with a large value of the @xmath0_. it is natural to introduce this figure of merit because there could be materials with excellent thermal properties but very large @xmath33 , or vice versa , or various other combinations , including both high or both low . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand materials showing a trade off between moderate @xmath33 and moderate thermal heating may be excellent candidates for photonic applications where the only limitations will be device design and optimization .    using this new @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluated the response for metal nanocomposites . in these structures </S>",
    "<S> we have a lot of freedom in choosing and controlling @xmath26 , @xmath29 , and @xmath5 , which are the only free parameters in the above figure of merit . in the evaluation we assumed the following :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 , @xmath20 , and @xmath19 can be considered to be properties of the host only and are not influenced by the presence of the metal nanostructures ( i.e. _ dilute limit approximation _ ) ; 2 .   </S>",

    "<S> the particle diameters are such that quantum confinement effects due to intra - band dipole electronic transitions are negligible ; 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the nonlinear susceptibility comes from the inter - band electric dipole transition , and the contribution is negative , and purely imaginary .    with the above assumptions we calculated @xmath0 ( eq . [ eq : fomc ] ) for a metal nanocomposite , by noting the following : @xmath34}{4\\pi im[\\chi_{eff}^{(3)}]}\\label{eq : n2overbetalambda}\\ ] ]    where we have ignored , for the moment , the frequency dependence of the nonlinear susceptibilities . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 is the effective nonlinear susceptibility and is given in the context of mie s theory by:@xmath36 where @xmath37 is the volume fraction of the metal in the host matrix , @xmath38 is the third order susceptibility of the metal cluster , and @xmath39 is an enhancement factor produced by the dielectric confinement , which can be expressed as : @xmath40 where @xmath2 is the real dielectric constant of the host , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the real and imaginary dielectric constants of the metal nanoparticles respectively . using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : chieff ] in eq . </S>",

    "<S> as would be expected , this @xmath0 goes to zero under the highly absorbing conditions found at the plasmon resonance condition of @xmath49 . on the other hand , as fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ cap : figureofmerit](c ) , large maxima are observed in the wavelength range of @xmath50 to @xmath51 for the various metals using the parameters from table [ cap : optical - properties ] . </S>",
    "<S> the large maxima occur at the condition of : @xmath52 the wavelengths corresponding to these maxima for each metal are tabulated in table [ cap : location - of - peaks ] , and are compared to nearby peak positions in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 . a significant difference in wavelength of the @xmath0 to those in the thermal or tpa cases </S>",
    "<S> is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is especially important when put in the context of data communication bandwidths , where wavelength separations of 1 to 5 nm are routine . </S>",

    "<S> the real and imaginary components of the dielectric susceptibility of the metal in the high frequency limit ( @xmath53 ) are given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the contribution to the dielectric constant of the metal from bound charges and @xmath56 is the bulk plasmon resonance of the metal@xmath57 using the condition for the @xmath0 maxima and the condition for surface plasmon resonance given by:@xmath58    after some algebraic manipulation , the frequency @xmath59 at which the maxima in the @xmath0 occurs can be related to the surface plasmon frequency @xmath60 by the expression : @xmath61    in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : omegafom ] , the quantity on the right side is always positive , but the quantity on the left side can be positive or negative giving : @xmath62    therefore we find that the maxima in the @xmath0 can be located above or below the surface plasmon resonance . in the evaluation of eq . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is apparent that this crude model also predicts a shift in the peak position from @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 and actually predicts very well the @xmath67 position for the case of cu estimated from eq . </S>",

    "<S> recently there have been reports of lasing of au nanoparticles in water @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors estimated a surface plasmon resonance for their au - water system to be at 700 nm while the observed lasing occurred with various peaks located at 720 , nm or higher . using our model , </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated that the @xmath0 achieves a maximum for au nanoparticles in water at @xmath68 for an electron relaxation time of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> while this may be rather coincidental , it should be emphasized that the @xmath0 expressed by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ fomcfinal ] represents a situation where losses are minimized and the nanoparticles act as excellent scattering centers .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have defined a compound figure of merit @xmath0 for metal - dielectric nanocomposites that takes into account limitations to optical switching from thermal index changes and two photon absorption . as expected </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 is zero at the plasmon resonance when large absorption occurs but has extremely large values at a value of frequency which is dependent only upon the dielectric constants of the metal and dielectric . </S>",
