    "in the usual hierarchical structure formation model , pregalactic objects begin forming through gravitational instability in high - density regions and coalesce to form progressively larger structures ( e.g. , springel et al .",

    "massive clusters of galaxies , the largest self - gravitating systems in the universe today , saw the earliest major star formation and have been assembling for the longest time .",
    "the rapid merging and accretion in these dense environments has obscured much information about the early dynamical histories .",
    "however , high - resolution numerical simulations indicate that old metal - poor globular clusters ( gcs ) and diffuse stellar light provide reliable tracers of the earliest star - forming substructures ( moore et al .  2006 ; abadi et al .  2006 ) , including their spatial distributions and kinematics .",
    "in contrast , the surviving dwarf satellites likely originated at lower densities and were accreted later ( see font et al .",

    "; johnston et al .  2008 ) .",
    "gcs are especially useful tracers because they are abundant in all large galaxies and most dwarfs with masses of at least @xmath14 ( e.g. , peng et al .",

    "consistent with their being relicts of early accretion .",
    "harris & van den berg ( 1981 ) introduced the specific frequency @xmath5 ( the number of gcs per unit galaxy luminosity ) as a normalized measure of population richness .",
    "@xmath5 has been measured for galaxies of all morphological types and environments ( see reviews by harris 1991 , 2001 ; west et al .",
    "2004 ; brodie & strader 2006 ) , though most commonly in early - type galaxies , as spirals generally have much sparser gc systems . for early - type dwarfs",
    ", @xmath5 exhibits a large scatter , with values ranging from zero to @xmath3100 , and some tendency to increase as the luminosity decreases .",
    "conversely , for more luminous ellipticals , @xmath5 ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath310 , and tends to increase with luminosity .",
    "similar trends of @xmath5 with luminosity occur for early - type galaxies in both clusters and isolated environments ( e.g. , cho et al .  2012 ; alamo - martnez et al .",
    "the exception is for galaxies near the dynamical centers of massive clusters , where the total gc population often exceeds 10,000 , and the central cd galaxy may have @xmath16 ( harris et al .  1995 ; west et al .",
    "blakeslee et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the number @xmath17  of gcs in such systems scales approximately with cluster velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity , and other indicators of cluster mass , rather than with host galaxy luminosity .",
    "thus , the number per unit total ( halo ) mass shows much less variation than @xmath5 . mclaughlin ( 1999 ) found a similar scaling of @xmath17  in massive ellipticals with the baryonic mass ; blakeslee ( 1999 ) showed that the ratio of the scale factors was consistent with the expected baryon fraction .",
    "numerical models also predict an approximately constant frequency of old metal - poor gcs relative to total halo mass , depending on the degree of local variation in the epoch of reionization ( moore et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "peng et al .  (",
    "2008 ) studied @xmath5 and the stellar mass fraction contained in gcs for 100 early - type galaxies from the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) virgo cluster survey ( ct et al .",
    "they found that the gc stellar mass fraction tends to be larger in giant and dwarf galaxies , but is universally low at intermediate masses .",
    "such intermediate mass galaxies also appear to have been most efficient in converting baryons into stars ( e.g. , van den bosch et al .  2007 ;",
    "conroy & wechsler 2009 ; guo et al .",
    "thus , as previously found for central cluster galaxies , the @xmath5 and gc stellar mass fraction for the ensemble of virgo galaxies scale more closely with halo mass ( mainly dark matter ) than with the stellar mass or luminosity .",
    "the observed variations therefore indicate a variable field star formation efficiency following the gc formation epoch .",
    "spitler & forbes ( 2009 ) compiled a sample of galaxies with a wide range of masses in various environments and also concluded that there was a direct proportionality between the mass in gcs and the total halo mass .",
    "following this idea , georgiev et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) studied gc formation efficiencies within an analytical model that included mass - dependent feedback mechanisms .",
    "they found that the gc formation efficiency is roughly constant with halo mass , but @xmath5 and stellar mass fraction vary with the field star formation efficiency , which in turn depends on halo mass and is highest at intermediate values . in this model ,",
    "the increased scatter among dwarf galaxies was attributed to stochastic effects at low mass .",
    "however , peng et  al .  had found that the virgo dwarfs with high gc mass fractions were nearly all within 1  mpc of m87 , indicating that location plays a key role in determining the relative fractions of baryons in gcs and field stars in these systems .",
    "this could also be a consequence of the formation epoch , with gc formation efficiency being higher at early times ( e.g. , kruijssen 2012 ) .    in the coma cluster , peng et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found a very large population of intracluster globular clusters ( igcs ) , which are bound to the cluster potential , rather than to individual galaxies .",
    "limits on the amount of diffuse intracluster light ( icl ) imply a high @xmath5 for the igc population , similar to the values for high-@xmath5 cd galaxies and the centrally located virgo dwarfs .",
    "igcs appear to be a common feature of galaxy clusters : a significant population likely resides in abell  1185 ( jordn et al .  2003 ; west et  al .",
    "2011 ) , a cluster in which the cd galaxy is offset from the centroid of x - ray emission ; lee et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also report evidence for igcs in virgo . the igc populations are overwhelmingly metal - poor , with colors typical of gcs in dwarf galaxies and the outer regions of massive galaxies .",
    "because of their early formation and subsequent dissipationless assembly , the spatial density profile of the igcs is expected to trace the total cluster mass profile . however , because of their low surface densities and contamination from gcs bound to galaxies , it remains unclear whether they follow more closely the stellar light , the baryonic matter ( including the x - ray gas ) , or the dark matter distribution .",
    "observations thus far have been limited to nearby ( @xmath18 ) moderate mass clusters .",
    "further progress requires studying massive clusters with many thousands of gcs and well characterized baryonic and total mass density profiles .",

    "the final_residual image includes many smaller galaxies and residuals from larger galaxies that were difficult to model and not well represented by the sextractor background map . to remove these smaller ( but resolved ) structures , a very smooth image was created with the iraf task _ rmedian _ ( a ring median filter with inner and outer radii of  5 and 9  pix , respectively ) applied to the final_residual image .",

    "the gcs in a1689 should appear at @xmath41  ab . we therefore selected gc candidates as point sources having @xmath42 ; the faint limit is the magnitude where our detection is 50% complete in the innermost region of the cluster ( see below ) . from this combined selection",
    ", we obtained a sample of 8212 gc candidates ; figure  [ fig_xy_ngc ] shows their @xmath43 positions , which are strongly concentrated near the cd galaxy , but excesses of gc candidates are also visible around other cluster galaxies .      to quantify the completeness ,",
    "250000 artificial stars were constructed from the psf model and added 500 at a time with random @xmath44 positions .",
    "the origin of the polar coordinates was the center of the cd galaxy , and the uniform random distribution in @xmath45 yielded a higher density of sources near the cluster center , mimicking the actual sources . in adding the artificial sources",

    "we carried out this whole process twice , using two different magnitude distributions for the artificial sources : ( 1 ) a uniform , or box - shaped , distribution with @xmath46 ; ( 2 ) a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath4731.6 , @xmath481.5 , and the constraint @xmath49 ( more than a magnitude beyond the completeness limit ) .",
    "the latter case approximates the expected gclf in a1689 ( see sec .",
    "[ n_sn.sect ] ) ; both distributions are illustrated in figure  [ fig_completeness ] .    in the case of the uniform magnitude distribution , the fraction of recovered stars as a function of magnitude is well described by a function of the form : @xmath50\\ , , \\label{eq.pritchet}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the magnitude at which the completeness is 0.5 , and @xmath52 determines the steepness of the curve .",
    "this function @xmath53 is sometimes referred to as a `` pritchet function '' ( e.g. , mclaughlin et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in the case of the gaussian magnitude distribution",
    ", the fraction of recovered stars actually exceeds unity before the steep drop in completeness sets in .",
    "this excess of detected sources is due to eddington ( 1913 ) bias : as a result of the steeply rising luminosity function , measurement errors cause more faint sources to be scattered to brighter detection magnitudes , and relatively fewer bright sources to be scattered to fainter levels . in this case , including both magnitude bias and incompleteness , the recovered fraction was not well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq.pritchet ] ) .",
    "however , we found that it could be represented by the following modified version of the fermi function : @xmath54}}{1+\\exp{[a(m - m_0)]}}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the magnitude at which the completeness would be 0.5 for a standard fermi function ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the other parameters are linked , but in rough terms , @xmath57 controls the steepness of the cutoff , @xmath58 ( which must be @xmath59 ) affects where the departure above unity begins , and @xmath60 determines the amplitude of the departure .",
    "although the pritchet function and uniform magnitude distributions are widely used in the literature , our analysis indicates that these assumptions require great caution : when the actual counts follow a steeply rising luminosity function , incompleteness corrections based on a uniform magnitude distribution overestimate the number of real sources .",
    "we adopt the results from the artificial star tests with the gaussian magnitude distribution , since this more closely approximates the expected gclf .",
    "the magnitude distribution of background sources is also a rising function , more similar to the bright side of the gaussian than to the uniform distribution",
    ".    the ratios of recovered to added artificial stars as a function of recovered magnitude were calculated , and a modified fermi function was fitted to the completeness fractions in three annular regions : from 0 to 33 , from 33to 11 , and beyond 11 ( red circles in figure  [ fig_xy_ngc ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath55 found for these three regions are 29.30 , 29.35 , and 29.33 mag , respectively .",
    "after applying the completeness corrections , the number of gc candidates brighter than our adopted limit @xmath61 increases from 8212 to @xmath62 , or 6% .",
    "had we used the completeness estimates based on the uniform magnitude distribution , the increase would instead have been 14% , overestimating the final gc number by  7.5% .          to estimate the number of background contaminants , we first calculate the number of gc candidates per unit area as a function of radius ( figure  [ gcdens_radial ] ) .",
    "then , we fit to the surface number density profile , @xmath63 , a srsic function ( srsic 1968 ) plus the background  as a free parameter : @xmath64 \\right\\ } + bg,\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the effective radius that encloses half of the gc sample ; @xmath66 is @xmath67 at @xmath65 ; @xmath68 is the srsic index , which controls the shape of the profile ; and @xmath69 ( graham & driver 2005 ) .",
    "we found that the fitted srsic parameters and background were very sensitive to the radial range of the fit .",
    "this is partly because of deviations from a smooth profile , but also because the number density of sources continues to decrease as a function of radius , without reaching a constant level .",
    "however , the mean background within our adopted magnitude limits must be in the range @xmath70 arcmin@xmath71 ( the high value being the observed density in the outermost bins ) . after trying various radial cuts",
    ", we found the most robust value of  resulted by masking the regions around all the bright galaxies ( gray region in the right panel of figure  [ fig_xy_ngc ] , based on our luminosity model ) .",
    "this removes the concentrations of point sources associated with individual galaxies ; the remaining objects follow a shallower , smoother radial density profile , shown in the left panel of figure  [ gcdens_radial ] .",
    "the fitted background in this case was @xmath72 arcmin@xmath71 , which was within the broad range returned by the various fits prior to the galaxy masking ( see examples in left panel of figure  [ gcdens_radial ] ) .",
    "we adopt a conservative uncertainty of @xmath73  arcmin@xmath71 , where the error bar encompasses the unlikely case that all objects in the outermost radial bins are background objects .",
    "we note that after masking the bright galaxies , the remaining objects ( blue points in the left panel of figure  [ gcdens_radial ] ) may represent a smooth population of igcs in a1689 .",
    "if we integrate the srsic function for these putative igcs over the full area of the image ( including masked regions , since igcs would also be projected onto the galaxies ) , we find that 50% of the gc candidates are in this smooth component .",
    "of course , some of these objects will be associated with galaxies , since the spatial distributions of gcs are often more extended than the starlight .",
    "we therefore consider 50% to be an upper limit on the igc fraction within this central region .",
    "more detailed modeling of the gc distributions of individual galaxies , and wider coverage to trace the profile of the smooth component to larger radii , would help to refine this estimate .",
    "our estimate of the background is based on the outer parts of the acs / wfc image , but in the case of a1689 , it is necessary to make a radial - dependent correction for the effect of cluster lensing ( blakeslee 1999 ) .",
    "the gravitational field of a1689 affects the spatial and magnitude distributions of the background sources . following the formalism of broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , in the absence of lensing we expect a power - law distribution of background sources @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a constant , and @xmath76 is the logarithmic slope of the counts .",
    "the lensing magnifies the brightness of the sources by the position - dependent magnification factor @xmath77 , and thus shifts the source magnitudes brighter by @xmath78 .",
    "it also increases the surface area by the same factor , and thus decreases the surface density . as a result",
    ", the effect of the lens magnification can be approximated as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the observed ( lensed ) number density .",
    "generally , @xmath81 , so the background counts over a fixed magnitude range are decreased , or diluted , by a factor @xmath82 .",
    "the counts can also be amplified ( @xmath83 ) in regions where @xmath84 ( see broadhurst et al .",
    "1995 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the magnification @xmath77 depends on the distance and mass distribution of the lens , as well as on the distance to the source plane .",
    "in general , it can be written as : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the convergence and shear , respectively , for a given source distance .",
    "we use a non - parametric @xmath86 map for a1689 ( m.j .",
    "jee et al .",
    "2013 , in  prep . ;",
    "see also jee et  al .",
    "2007 ) , and since we are calculating the number densities in circular annuli , we adopt the spherical approximation @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the mean convergence interior to radius @xmath45 .",
    "taking @xmath90 ( e.g. , bentez et al .",
    "2004 ) , we finally derive the dilution factor @xmath91 as a function of radius ; the orange line in the right panel of figure  [ gcdens_radial ] represents the product of @xmath91 and the background at large radius .",
    "the background level  has been normalized to the outermost several bins ; interior to this , the dilution is both negative and positive , depending on radius .",
    "we note that coe et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also constructed a @xmath86 map for a1689 using their `` lensperfect '' algorithm , and they reported the best - fitting srsic model parameters for the radially averaged profile . as a check , we derived a background source dilution profile using coe et al.s srsic parameters ; the differences with respect the above analysis was less than 1% .",
    "finally , we use the radial surface density distribution to correct for the incomplete area coverage ( accounting for masked regions and incomplete outer annuli ) out to a projected radius of 400  kpc ( 130 ) .",
    "this increases the sample of gc candidates to 10,596 , and subtraction of the radial - dependent background contamination then gives a final sample of @xmath92 gc candidates with @xmath61 and @xmath93  kpc .",

    "this is probably an upper limit because gc formation likely occurred earlier in a1689 than in local clusters such as virgo , coma , or fornax ( see the related discussion in villegas et al .",

    "there is no significant star formation in the a1689 early - type galaxies that dominate this central field ( balogh et al .",
    "2002 ) , and stellar population models that match the colors of nearby giant ellipticals ( e.g. , 10  gyr , solar metallicity models of bruzual & charlot 2003 ) indicate that they have passively faded by about 0.20  mag since @xmath19 . assuming negligible destruction of gcs in this time ,",
    "the passive galaxy evolution will cause @xmath5 to become 20% higher at @xmath9 than at the observed epoch of a1689 .",
    "thus , the global value of @xmath119 within 400  kpc would correspond to @xmath120 at z=0 , after correcting for passive evolution , similar to the @xmath5 values observed for the central cd galaxies in the nearby virgo , coma , and hydra clusters ( tamura et al .  2006 ; peng et al .  2008 , 2011 ; harris et al .  2009 ;",
    "wehner et al .",
    "2008 ) . of course , for a more exact comparison",
    ", the @xmath5 values should be estimated on similar physical scales .",
    "blakeslee ( 1999 ) measured @xmath5 within apertures of 40 and 65kpc for the cores of six rich abell clusters ; he reported @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( with rms scatters of @xmath32 in both cases ) .",
    "the corresponding values for a1689 at z=0 are @xmath5(40)=10.6@xmath1030.4 and @xmath5(65)=11.5@xmath1030.5 , near the high end of the observed range for nearby massive clusters .",
    "in addition to the cumulative @xmath5 , it is also worth considering the behavior of the local @xmath5 .",
    "we have noted that the surface density distribution of gc candidates is not completely smooth , since they are preferentially located around the bright galaxies .",
    "this clustering causes the `` bump '' at @xmath123 ( 200 kpc ) in the gc radial density profile shown in figure  [ gcdens_radial ] .",
    "this feature in the gc density profile corresponds to a grouping of bright galaxies at this radius , as highlighted within the green annulus in the right panel of figure  [ snlocal_color ] .",
    "however , since the gcs are not perfect tracers of the stellar light , and their spatial concentrations are less sharply peaked than the galaxy profiles , an excess of galaxies at a given location tends to _ decrease _ the local value of @xmath5 , if the galaxies have a `` normal '' @xmath124 .",
    "therefore , at the same radius of 200  kpc where there is a `` bump '' in the number density of gcs , we actually find a `` dip '' in the local value of @xmath5 , as shown by the green band in the left panel of figure  [ snlocal_color ] .",
    "a corresponding dip occurs near 200 kpc in the cumulative @xmath5 distribution in figure  [ scumulative ] .",
    "the scaling of @xmath17  in brightest cluster galaxies with the total underlying mass within a common projected radius has been interpreted as a consequence of early universal gc formation efficiency in dense regions . using the value 0.71@xmath1030.22 gcs per @xmath125@xmath12(blakeslee 1999 ) ,",
    "our derived @xmath100 would predict a total mass of @xmath126@xmath12within 400 kpc in a1689 .",
    "however , this estimate depends on the gcs following the same radial profile as the total matter distribution . while observations indicate that their spatial distribution is more extended than the starlight , until now it has not been possible to test how they relate to the dark matter distribution .",
    "we explore these issues in the following section .",
    "with the goal of testing the existence of a universal gc formation efficiency in an extreme system such as a1689 , we compare the amounts of mass in this central field in the form of gcs , stars , hot intracluster gas , and total mass ( including dark matter ) .",
    "figure  [ gc_stars_icg_lens.ima ] provides a 2-d visual comparison of the number density of gcs , the galaxy luminosity model , the lensing - derived mass distribution , and the x - ray emission map .",
    "the symmetry and smoothness of the x - ray gas stand out ; this is not a resolution effect ( as evidenced by the compactness of the x - ray point sources in the image ) . to make quantitative comparisons ,",
    "we now derive the projected radial mass distributions for each component .             for the gcs",

    "the estimated total mass in gcs within this radius is therefore @xmath10=3.9@xmath11@xmath12 . for perspective",

    "of course , the assumption of a constant @xmath128@xmath132 at all radii is a first - order approximation .",
    "moreover , the @xmath133 , and thus the derived mass , can vary by @xmath330% , depending on the imf , but the choice of salpeter is reasonable for early - type galaxies ( e.g. , van  dokkum & conroy 2010 ; conroy & van  dokkum 2012 ) . finally ,",

    "the hot gas dominates the baryonic mass beyond the central @xmath161 kpc .    to investigate the radial run of the gc mass fraction relative to the other mass components , we plot in figure  [ ratios_plots ] the mass ratios for all possible combinations of the components in figure  [ massprofiles ] .",
    "the stellar mass fraction in gcs ( @xmath162 , panel @xmath163 ) increases by a factor of @xmath32.5 within the central 80  kpc , then levels off , consistent with the @xmath5 profile shown previously .",
    "however , compared to either the x - ray gas or total matter , the gc mass fraction decreases as a function of radius ( panels @xmath58 and @xmath57 , respectively ) ; the mass fraction in stars ( panels @xmath164 and @xmath154 ) shows a similar , even steeper , decline . as found in previous studies , the gas mass fraction ( panel @xmath165 ) appears to increase monotonically with radius .",
    "interestingly , the baryonic mass fraction ( ratio of baryons to total mass , panel @xmath166 ) reaches a minimum near 150  kpc , because the stellar mass is more concentrated than the dark matter , but the gas is more extended . this quantity has been studied extensively in galaxy clusters as an approximation to the baryonic mass fraction of the universe ( @xmath167/@xmath168 ) .",
    "for instance , lin et al .",
    "( 2012 ) measured baryon fractions for 94 galaxy clusters over a wide range redshift ; our value for a1689 in figure  [ ratios_plots ] agrees well with the results of this recent study .",
    "mclaughlin ( 1999 ) derived an average efficiency of gc formation per baryonic mass , i.e. , @xmath169@xmath128@xmath170/@xmath128@xmath171 , of 0.0026 within @xmath172 kpc . comparing mclaughlin s value with our estimate for the same radial range ( figure  [ ratios_plots]@xmath173 ) , we find @xmath174=0.0021 , which is within the scatter of the values found by mclaughlin .",
    "meanwhile , blakeslee ( 1999 ) reported a mean efficiency per total mass of @xmath175@xmath128@xmath170/@xmath128@xmath176 within @xmath177 kpc ; within this radius , we obtain @xmath178=1.8@xmath2810@xmath179 ( figure  [ ratios_plots]@xmath57 ) , in close agreement with the expected value . however , although the mass ratios within these relatively small radii are remarkably consistent with the `` universal '' efficiencies previously proposed in the literature , the global values are not . within 400 kpc ,",
    "we find @xmath180=0.00095 and @xmath181=6.1@xmath2810@xmath182 , both a factor of 3 lower than the values cited above . after converting to our assumed mean gc mass ,",
    "the results of spitler & forbes ( 2009 ) imply @xmath183 , about 30% lower than our value within 400  kpc but consistent within the errors ; however , it not clear what radius to use in this case .",
    "thus , we emphasize again the importance of comparing such ratios within the same physical radii .",
    "deep broadband imaging with _ hst_/acs ( @xmath290% complete to @xmath1 ) has revealed an extremely rich gc system in the center of the massive lensing cluster a1689 .",
    "the estimated total population of 162,850@xmath184 gcs within a projected radius of 400  kpc represents the largest system of gcs studied to date , six times the number within the same radius in the virgo cluster .",
    "the large error  bars are due to the uncertainty in the gclf parameters .",
    "although the gaussian form of the gclf is well calibrated for giant ellipticals in rich clusters , even with 20.9  hrs of integration , our data fall 1.6@xmath185 short of the gclf turnover ; we therefore sample only 10% of the gcs brighter than the turnover ( or 5% of the total population , assuming a symmetric gclf ) .",
    "thus , the large extrapolation yields a sizable systematic uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , this remains the largest gc system yet discovered , with at least a factor of two more than the next most populous systems , including coma and a3558 ( peng et al .",
    "2011 ; barber  degraaff 2011 ) .",
    "our analysis accounts for the effects of eddington bias , gravitational magnification of the background surface density , redshifting of the bandpass ( @xmath96  corrections ) , and passive evolution of the gclf .",
    "although it is possible that there has been some evolution in the shape of the gclf since @xmath0 , this would mainly occur by the destruction of low - mass gcs ( e.g. , jordn et al .  2007 ; mclaughlin & fall 2008 ) with little effect for the masses of objects near the gclf peak or brighter .",
    "our assumption of a symmetric gclf would therefore likely underestimate the population at @xmath0 , but the additional low - mass gcs would have little effect on our total mass estimates .",
    "the spatial distribution of gc candidates in the center of a1689 is not completely smooth ; there are obvious concentrations around the cluster galaxies . however , by masking the bright and intermediate - luminosity galaxies , we can trace an apparently smooth component , which comprises half of the total population when integrated over the field ( via the best - fit srsic model ) .",
    "if we identify these objects as belonging to a possible intracluster population of gcs , then there may be as many as @xmath380,000 such igcs within the central 400  kpc in a1689 .",
    "we consider this an upper limit , since some of these igc candidates are undoubtedly bound to individual galaxies .",
    "we plan to investigate this in more detail by modeling the gc distributions around individual galaxies .",
    "imaging to a similar depth at larger radii from the cluster center would also help in constraining the igc population .",
    "the cumulative @xmath5 increases from a value near @xmath186 within 10  kpc to @xmath187 ( not including systematic uncertainty from the gclf ) within 70  kpc .",
    "although the uncertainties in @xmath5 become large beyond 100 kpc , the profile appears to flatten , and the value within 150  kpc is @xmath188 . there is a clear dip in the cumulative @xmath5 around 200  kpc , before it rises again to @xmath7 within 300  kpc .",
    "the dip at 200 kpc occurs despite a local increase in the gc number density at the same radius ; it is caused by a subgrouping of several bright galaxies which appear to have a more normal @xmath189 ( as was shown by comparing the green regions in figure  [ snlocal_color ] ) .",
    "such galaxies contribute relatively more to the denominator of @xmath5 than to the numerator .",
    "this highlights the fact that cannibalization of normal cluster galaxies by the central cd will tend to decrease the @xmath5 , rather than increase it ; thus the high @xmath5 value must have been imprinted in the cluster core at early times .",
    "we have also noted that passive evolution of the galaxy luminosity since @xmath190 would cause the observed @xmath5 to increase by 20% at @xmath9 , but even with this effect , the high @xmath5 in a1689 would not be anomalous among cd galaxies in local clusters .",
    "remarkably , the mass in gcs within 400  kpc of the center of a1689 is equivalent to 60 - 80% of the total stellar mass of the milky way .",
    "integrated out to the virial radius of @xmath191  mpc , the total mass in gcs is likely twice that of the stars in our galaxy .",
    "of course , this is a small fraction of the total mass in a1689 .",
    "we have examined the mass profile of the gcs as a function of radius and compared it with the mass profiles of the stellar light , hot intracluster gas , and total lensing - derived matter content within this central field .",
    "the mass profile of the gcs is somewhat more extended than the stellar light , but more concentrated than the hot gas or dark matter .",
    "if the mass fraction is viewed as a gc formation efficiency , then the efficiency ( in terms of either baryonic or total mass ) decreases as a function of radius , and there is no `` universal '' value .    on the other hand , when compared within the same physical radii , the gc mass fractions with respect to the total and baryonic masses agree with the values found in samples of nearby clusters , all of which have masses lower than a1689 .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a universal gc formation profile within galaxy clusters .",
    "in contrast , lagan et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) estimated the stellar , intracluster gas , and total masses within @xmath192 for 19 galaxy clusters , and found a decrease in the stellar mass fraction with increasing total mass of the system .",
    "that is , more massive clusters had lower overall star formation efficiencies .",
    "taken together , these results are consistent with the view that the high @xmath5 values in cd galaxies are a consequence of `` missing '' stellar light in more massive clusters ( blakeslee 1997 ) , rather than an excess in the number of globular clusters .    finally , we note that in a recent study , surez - madrigal et al .",
    "( 2012 ) modeled the influence of the dark matter halo on molecular clouds at different locations within it .",
    "they found that the star formation efficiency of the clouds depends on the ambient density , and thus decreases with distance from the halo center , in qualitative agreement with our finding that gc formation efficiency decreases with radius . if the mass density profiles in galaxy clusters are approximately universal ( e.g. , navarro et al .  1997 )",
    ", then it would also make sense that the gc formation efficiency profile may follow a universal form .",
    "further studies of the gc , baryonic , and total mass profiles in galaxy clusters are needed to test this intriguing possibility .",
