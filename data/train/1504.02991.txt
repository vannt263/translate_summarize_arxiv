    "ever since its introduction by schrdinger  @xcite in the context of the epr paradox  @xcite , quantum entanglement has played a central role in quantum theory .",
    "while entanglement is responsible for the non - classical correlations leading to the violation of bell s inequalities  @xcite , it also plays a key role in quantum computing where it is connected with the exponential advantage of quantum algorithms over their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "studies of entanglement have led to a well developed mathematical theory of entanglement where positive maps ( p ) which are not completely positive ( cp )  @xcite and unextendable product bases ( upb )  @xcite play an important role  @xcite .",
    "these mathematical advances have led to the discovery of bound entangled states  @xcite : states from which one can not distill epr pairs although they are still provably non - separable .    quantum states ( pure or mixed ) are represented by positive definite hermitian operators @xmath2 with unit trace .",
    "for the special case when the rank of @xmath3 is one , it represents a pure state . for a bipartite composite system where states are defined on @xmath4 ,",
    "a state @xmath3 is said to be separable if it can be written as a convex sum : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are states in @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "a state is entangled , if it can not be written in the above form .",
    "the fundamental problem of determining whether a given state @xmath3 is separable or entangled remains open for general states of systems which are beyond @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    allowed quantum evolutions are those p maps which are cp .",
    "p maps which are not cp are not physically allowed quantum evolutions , because entangled states can lose their positivity when such a map is applied to one part of the system .",
    "therefore such maps act as entanglement witnesses .",
    "the partial transpose operation which is a particular entanglement witness , plays an important role in the identification of entangled states  @xcite .",
    "states which reveal their entanglement by acquiring one or more negative eigenvalues under partial transposition are called npt ( not - positive under partial transpose ) while the rest are called ppt ( positive under partial transpose ) .",
    "npt states are entangled while ppt states can be either entangled or separable . in @xmath10 and @xmath11 dimensional systems , it has been shown that a state is separable if and only if it is ppt  @xcite . therefore , in dimensions @xmath1 and larger , there are entangled states which are ppt  @xcite .",
    "these states in general require other entanglement witnesses to implicate their entanglement and can not be distilled to give epr pairs .",
    "such states ( with non - distillable entanglement ) are called ppt or bound entangled states .",
    "choi map and its generalizations have been used to detect the entanglement of certain classes of bound entangled states  @xcite . however , even for the @xmath12 system , the detection of bound entangled states is far from complete . local operations , including measurement and filtering , can not alter the status of the state from ppt to npt and therefore can be used to convert one npt state to another npt state or one ppt state to another ppt state .",
    "al . showed that , starting with a mixed entangled state of a @xmath13 system that does not violate bell inequalities , one can set up a local filtration scheme based on measurements such that the filtered states violate bell inequalities  @xcite . in this case",
    "only npt states were involved as there are no ppt entangled states for the @xmath13 case .",
    "these results have been extended , used and experimentally validated by a number of researchers  @xcite .",
    "our work is a generalization and extension of these results into the domain of ppt states of @xmath14 systems . in this work ,",
    "we introduce local filters which convert ppt entangled states not detectable by the choi map , to states which are detectable by the choi map .",
    "in particular we are able to show that the ppt states obtained from the upb can be converted into states detectable by the choi map .",
    "furthermore , we provide an explicit scheme for implementation of our filtration protocol via local projective measurements involving local ancillas .",
    "although the notation of entanglement is well defined for infinite dimensional spaces , we restrict ourselves to finite dimensional hilbert spaces in this paper .",
    "the material in this paper is arranged as follows : in section  [ filtration ] we describe our local filtration scheme .",
    "two examples are taken up in the section  [ filtration - ent ] where such schemes are used to manipulate entangled states .",
    "section  [ implementation ] describes a measurement - based scheme to realize the local filters while section  [ implementation - general ] describes the general scheme .",
    "section  [ implementation - two ] describes the implementation of filters used by gisin and section  [ implementation - three ] describes the implementation of filters on three - level systems .",
    "section  [ conc ] offers some concluding remarks .",
    "local filters are local non - unitary operators represented by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are invertible operators acting in the state spaces of their respective systems . given a bipartite quantum state @xmath18 , the filter acts on the state giving a new state @xmath19 which is a positive hermitian operator belonging to the same space and its trace",
    "can be brought to one by dividing by an appropriate positive number .",
    "for every invertible set of operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 we thus have a filter .",
    "let @xmath16 and @xmath17 be two full rank operators . then the map @xmath20 does not change the schmidt number of the state .",
    "terhal and horodecki  @xcite defined the schmidt rank of a general density matrix .",
    "a bipartite state @xmath3 has schmidt rank @xmath21 if    1 .",
    "for any ensemble decomposition of @xmath3 as @xmath22 where @xmath23 at least one of the vectors @xmath24 has schmidt rank @xmath21 .",
    "2 .   there exists a decomposition of @xmath3 where all vectors @xmath25 in the decomposition have a schmidt rank at most @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we need only to show that the schmidt number of pure bipartite states @xmath26 is invariant under the operation @xmath27 .",
    "the schmidt rank ( sr ) of @xmath28 is the matrix rank of @xmath29 . thus @xmath30 let @xmath31 and @xmath32 be the singular value decompositions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , where @xmath33 are unitary operators .",
    "then @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are mutually orthogonal bases of the first and second systems respectively . since @xmath16 and @xmath17 are of full rank , the diagonal matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are also of full rank , and the above assertion holds , i.e. @xmath39 is invariant under these operations .",
    "the above proposition further shows that , entanglement is not created or destroyed by the above operations .",
    "let us choose a standard basis @xmath40 , @xmath41 in an @xmath42-dimensional state space @xmath43 .",
    "any density operator @xmath44 can then be written as @xmath45 .",
    "transpose operation is defined through its action on @xmath3 @xmath46 a bipartite state @xmath3 is defined to be ppt if and only if @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the transpose operation defined on @xmath49 as described in equation  ( [ transpose ] ) .",
    "the ppt or npt character of a state is invariant under an invertible local filtration operation .",
    "now consider @xmath50 , @xmath51 to be be the standard basis in @xmath52 .",
    "we can write @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "we then have @xmath55 after the application of the transpose operation on the second system we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the complex conjugate of @xmath17 .",
    "this proves that ppt states remain ppt under a local filter defined in equation  ( [ filter ] ) .",
    "a similar argument holds for npt states .",
    "if the original state is entangled , the nature of its entanglement , ( npt or ppt ) does not change under the filtering operation .",
    "therefore for a given ppt entangled state , the filtered state is another ppt entangled state .",
    "it may turn out that even if the entanglement of the original state is not detectable by a given entanglement witness , the filtered state reveals its entanglement by the same witness .",
    "this thus allows us to generate new ppt entangled states from the old ones .",
    "consider a density operator for the system @xmath60 , defined by two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64 is the normalization constant and this @xmath3 is a unit trace density operator for @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the state is entangled for a range of values of @xmath62 and @xmath61 ; however it is not always detected by the choi maps given in equations  ( [ eqn:1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn:2 ] ) .",
    "for instance , set @xmath67 , then for @xmath68 , the state is not detectable by the choi map .",
    "consider a local filter @xmath69 the filtered state after the application of this filter is obtained as @xmath70 we now apply the choi map given in equation  ( [ eqn:1 ] ) on the first system via @xmath71 to the filtered as well as non - filtered density operator to obtain @xmath72 for the operator @xmath73 for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 , the minimum eigenvalue turns out to be negative , indicating that the state is entangled . on the other hand , the minimum eigen value of the operator @xmath76 which is obtained by the application of choi map without filtering , is positive .",
    "this shows that the local filter defined in equation  ( [ filter1 ] ) has converted the state @xmath77 whose entanglement was not detectable via the choi map into a state @xmath78 whose entanglement is detectable via the choi map .",
    "an important example of bound entangled states is provided by the well known upb construction known as ` tiles '  @xcite for a @xmath14 system @xmath79 the mixed state @xmath80 provides an example of a ppt entangled state  @xcite .",
    "choi maps , applied directly , can not detect the entanglement of such states .",
    "consider the local filter @xmath81 applying this filter gives a new filtered state given by @xmath82 we now apply the second choi map given in equation  ( [ eqn:2 ] ) on the second system via @xmath83 to the filtered as well as non - filtered density operator to obtain @xmath84 the operator @xmath85 has a negative eigen value which reveals the entanglement of @xmath86 while @xmath87 does not have a negative eigen value .",
    "this shows that the entanglement of the state @xmath86 is not directly revealed by the choi map , however , it can be filtered into a state that is detected by the choi map .",
    "this is directly related to the construction given in terms of the automorphisms in  @xcite and is much simpler than the construction given in  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the question of the physical interpretation and implementation of the local quantum filtration process introduced in the previous section .",
    "a filter is defined through its action given in equation  ( [ filter ] ) and comprises of invertible operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath16 acts locally on @xmath52 ( the hilbert space of alice ) and @xmath17 acts locally on on @xmath49 ( the hilbert space of bob ) .",
    "we choose the standard bases in @xmath52 and @xmath49 .",
    "each of these operators has a singular valued decomposition given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath90 are unitary operators and @xmath91 are diagonal with real positive definite diagonal entries .",
    "the unitary operators correspond to hamiltonian evolutions and can hence be physically realized in a straightforward way .",
    "we therefore focus here on the implementation of diagonal matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "consider the implementation of @xmath37 on @xmath52 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath92 $ ] has diagonal entries @xmath93 such that @xmath94 .",
    "we now show that such a @xmath37 can be implemented by first extending the hilbert space by adding one qubit as ancilla and then measuring an appropriate projection operator @xmath95 . to achieve this ,",
    "we first consider a set of @xmath42 orthogonal but un - normalized vectors of the form @xmath96 in the @xmath42 dimensional system hilbert space .",
    "we extend each of these vectors into a @xmath97 dimensional hilbert space to form a new set of vectors @xmath98 given by @xmath99 .",
    "in addition to being mutually orthogonal , these vectors are also normalized .",
    "thus we have constructed an orthonormal set of @xmath42 vectors in a @xmath97 dimensional hilbert space formed from the @xmath42-dimensional system and a two - dimensional ancilla .",
    "corresponding to each of these vectors , we can construct a projection operator @xmath100 given by @xmath101 where the @xmath102 matrices are given by : @xmath103 the projection operator obtained by adding these mutually orthogonal projectors is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 , is the original operator that we wanted to implement , @xmath106 is a complementary operator obtained from @xmath37 and @xmath107 represents the cross terms .",
    "now consider the system to be in an arbitrary state @xmath108 and the one - qubit ancilla to be in the state @xmath109 .",
    "consider a measurement of @xmath95 on this composite system .",
    "if the outcome of the measurement is positive , we retain the state .",
    "the state after such a selection is given by the action of the projection operator @xmath95 on the composite state : @xmath110        we further carry out a projective measurement of the projector operator @xmath109 on the ancilla qubit and retain the state only if the outcome is positive .",
    "we now discard the ancilla which is anyway decoupled from the system .",
    "this completes the implementation of the map @xmath37 on the system density operator @xmath108 .",
    "thus to realize the operator @xmath37 in the space of the system , we need to carry out two projective measurements : first measure the projector @xmath95 in the combined space of the system and ancilla and retain the state if the answer is positive and then make another measurement of the projector @xmath111 only in the ancilla space and retain the state if the outcome is positive . as mentioned earlier , to implement @xmath16 we need to implement the unitaries @xmath112 and @xmath113 which can be accomplished via the standard hamiltonian evolution .",
    "for the implementation of the map @xmath17 on the second system in the hilbert space @xmath114 we follow an analogous procedure . the non - unitary part represented by @xmath38 is implemented via two projective measurements after adding an ancilla qubit and the unitaries @xmath115 and @xmath116 involved in the singular decomposition of @xmath17 are implemented via a hamiltonian evolution .    in an actual implementation",
    "we require an ensemble with several copies of the shared state @xmath3 between alice and bob .",
    "the protocol works as follows :    * * step 1 : * alice implements the unitary @xmath113 on her part of the state and bob implements the unitary @xmath116 on his part of the state . *",
    "* step 2 : * alice and bob each attach a one - qubit ancilla prepared in a state @xmath117 , to their part of the state .",
    "alice measures projector @xmath95 corresponding to @xmath37 followed by a measurement of @xmath118 on her ancilla qubit .",
    "bob measures the projector @xmath119 corresponding to @xmath38 followed by a measurement of @xmath120 on his ancilla qubit .",
    "they retain the state if all the four measurements give positive results .",
    "otherwise they discard the state . * * step 3 : * if they retain the state in the previous step , each one of them discards the ancilla qubits and then alice implements @xmath112 on her part of the state and bob implements @xmath115 on his part of the state .",
    "they repeat this process on all the copies of @xmath3 to obtain the new filtered ensemble .",
    "this protocol obviously requires classical communication between alice and bob because they need to know the outcome of the measurements that the other performs .",
    "the situation is schematically depicted in figure  [ filterpic ] .",
    "an interesting example of quantum filtration was introduced by gisin  @xcite for an entangled mixed state of two spin-@xmath121 particles not violating the bell - chsh inequality . in this scheme by using a polarized beam splitter one can convert such an input state to an output state which remains entangled but , this time , its entanglement can be detected by a bell inequality violation .",
    "we recast this filtration scheme and connect it with our results .",
    "let us suppose that alice and bob share a @xmath13 system @xmath122 between themselves . interpreting the gisin filter in our formalism reveals that in that case @xmath123 , where the operators @xmath124 and @xmath125 are given by @xmath126 in the notation of reference  @xcite , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are two real numbers such that @xmath130 and @xmath131 so that @xmath132 .",
    "let us consider the implementation of the non - unitary operator @xmath124 .",
    "since the operator @xmath124 is acting locally , we need to look for the map @xmath133 since @xmath124 is a diagonal matrix ( @xmath134 ) , we do not need to undertake a singular value decomposition .",
    "we directly introduce two mutually orthogonal but un - normalized vectors @xmath135 as discussed in section  [ implementation - general ] , by adding a one - qubit ancilla these two - dimensional vectors can be extended into four - dimensional orthonormal vectors @xmath136 constructing the corresponding mutually orthogonal projectors results in @xmath137 the required projector @xmath138 is then given by @xmath139 here @xmath140 and @xmath141 are defined following the definitions below equation  ( [ theprojector ] ) .",
    "consider now the action of this projector on a state where the system is in an arbitrary state @xmath108 and the ancilla qubit is in the state @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath143 this is the result of measurement of @xmath95 on the composite system for the case when the outcome is positive . to extract the top left block of the above matrix",
    ", we perform another projective measurement in the ancilla space and retain it if the outcome of measurement of @xmath144 is positive .",
    "bob does a similar exercise to implement @xmath125 in his laboratory and both alice and bob retain the state only when the outcomes of measurement of all four projectors are positive .",
    "this completes the protocol .      in section  [ filtration - ent ] we demonstrated the role of local filters in strengthening the entanglement detection capabilities of entanglement witnesses for @xmath14 systems . here",
    "we delineate the implementation of such a filtration process for these systems .",
    "we begin by discussing the filtration on a single three - level system @xmath145 .",
    "we consider the following transformation @xmath146 where @xmath31 is the singular value decomposition of @xmath16 and @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "we now introduce three mutually orthogonal and un - normalized vectors , in a three - dimensional hilbert space @xmath149 now introducing a qubit as an ancilla and extending the above vectors in the composite hilbert space of 6 dimensions , we obtain @xmath150 which are orthonormal .",
    "the projection operators corresponding to these vectors are given by @xmath151 and can be written explicitly as @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 the projector @xmath95 corresponding to the operator @xmath155 is thus given by @xmath156 for any operator @xmath157 we use a one - qubit ancillary system in the state @xmath109 and measure the projector @xmath95 .",
    "this leads us to an equation which is the same as the equation  ( [ ar ] ) with @xmath124 and @xmath141 replaced by @xmath155 and @xmath158 .",
    "similarly we can do the analysis from bob s point of view and arrive at the projector @xmath119 corresponding to @xmath38 ( @xmath159 ) . using this projector and a one qubit ancilla",
    "he sets up his measurements .",
    "then they both follow the protocol steps 1 - 3 given in the last part of section  [ implementation - general ] to complete the filtration process and obtain the new joint density operator .",
    "in this work , we discussed the role of local filters in transforming one ppt entangled state to another ppt entangled state .",
    "it may turn out that the entanglement of the new state is detectable by a p map which is not cp while the entanglement of the original state is not detectable by the map .",
    "it is in this sense that local filters can enhance the power of an entanglement witness in detecting entanglement .",
    "we give two concrete examples where this actually occurs . in the first example",
    ", a new class of bound entangled states becomes detectable by the choi map and in the second example ppt entangled states in the orthogonal complement of upb become detectable by the choi map .",
    "we then undertook the analysis of these filtration schemes as explicit local projective measurements coupled with local unitaries .",
    "it turns out that we need to add a one - qubit ancilla for both the parties involved in order to implement the non - unitary part of these filters as local measurements .",
    "we have constructed explicit projection operators corresponding to the filters that we have used .    a point worth emphasizing",
    "is that these local filters do not change the npt or ppt status of a state .",
    "gisin exploited this fact to convert npt states of two qubits which do not violate bell s inequalities into the ones which violate bell s inequalities .",
    "we have used these filters to convert one ppt entangled state into another ppt entangled state such that the ppt entanglement is detectable by a given entanglement witness .",
