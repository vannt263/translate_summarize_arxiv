    "an efficient solution , known as the pagerank algorithm ( pra ) proposed by brin and page in 1998 @xcite , forms the basis of the google search engine used by the majority of internautes in everyday life .",
    "the pra is based on the construction of the google matrix which can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) : @xmath2 here the matrix @xmath3 is constructed from the adjacency matrix @xmath4 of directed network links between @xmath5 nodes so that @xmath6 and the elements of columns with only zero elements are replaced by @xmath7 .",

    "the right eigenvector at @xmath10 is the pagerank vector with positive elements @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "all www nodes can be ordered by decreasing @xmath15 so that the pagerank plays a primary role in the ordering of websites and information retrieval .",
    "the classification of nodes in the decreasing order of @xmath15 values is used by the google search to classify importance of web nodes .",
    "the information retrieval and ordering is based on this classification and we also use it in the following .",
    "it is interesting and important to note that by the construction the operator @xmath14 belongs to the class of perron - frobenius operators @xcite .",
    "such type of operators naturally appear in the ergodic theory @xcite and in the description of dynamical systems with hamiltonian or dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "the studies of properties of @xmath14 are usually done only for the pagerank vector which can be find efficiently by the pra due to a relatively small average number of links in www . at present",
    "google succeeds to operate with pagerank vectors of size of the whole www being of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "it is established that for large www subsets @xmath15 is satisfactory described by a scale - free algebraic decay with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pagerank ordering index and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the studies of pagerank properties are now very active in the computer science community being presented in a number of interesting publications ( see e.g. @xcite and an overview of the field in @xcite ) .",
    "while the properties of the pagerank are of primary importance it is also interesting to analyze the properties of the google matrix @xmath14 as a whole large matrix .",
    "such an analysis can help to establish links between the google matrix and other fields of physics where large matrices play an important role . among such fields we can mention the random matrix theory @xcite which finds applications for a description of spectra in complex many - body quantum systems and the anderson localization which is an important physical phenomenon for an electron transport in disordered systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a transition from localized to delocalized eigenstates also can take place in networks of small world type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the physical systems considered in @xcite all matrices are hermitian with real eigenvalues while the perron - frobenius matrices have generally complex eigenvalues .    a first attempt to analyze the properties of right eigenvectors @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and complex eigenvalues @xmath11",

    "there is a significant gap between @xmath10 of pagerank vector and @xmath23 of other vectors .",
    "we note that according to @xcite the university networks have @xmath24 close to @xmath25 but after randomization of links a large gap emerges in the spectrum of @xmath22 .",
    "this gap in @xmath26 was rather large and was not sensitive to a variation of @xmath0 in the interval @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the pagerank vector also was not very sensitive to @xmath0 while for real www it is know that @xmath15 is rather sensitive to @xmath0 due to existence of @xmath24 close to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "thus the results obtained in @xcite show that even if the google matrix is constructed on the basis of typical models of scale - free networks it is quite possible that its spectrum may have a large gap for @xmath27 thus being rather far from spectral properties of the google matrices of www .",

    "cm      as discussed above a nontrivial decay of the pagerank @xmath15 in our ulam network appears due to a dissipative nature of the map ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , since @xmath171 there is a global contraction of the phase space area by a factor @xmath172 after @xmath43 iterations of the map ( after its period ) .",
    "such a property is very natural for the continuous map but it is more difficult to see its signature from the matrix form of the perron - frobenius operator after the introduction of discreteness of the phase space .",
    "nevertheless this contraction can be extracted from the matrix @xmath14 taken at @xmath104 . to extract it we apply @xmath14 with @xmath104 to a homogeneous vector @xmath173 getting the new vector @xmath174 and count the number of nodes @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 is some positive number characterizing the level of the distribution .",
    "then the contraction of the network is defined as a fraction of such states : @xmath178 .",
    "the result of computation of the contraction factor for the ulam network of map ( [ eq2 ] ) for the sets @xmath55 , @xmath56 is shown in fig .",

    "the network contraction parameter @xmath179 is independent of @xmath180 in a large interval @xmath181 and it converges to the contraction value @xmath182 of a continuous map in the limit of large matrix size @xmath5 .",
    "= 4.2 cm = 4.2 cm    -0.2 cm    we think that the google matrix of www networks can be also characterized by a global contraction factor and it would be interesting to study its properties in more detail .",
    "however , this remains a task for future studies .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated that the perron - frobenius operator built from a simple dissipative map with dynamical attractors generates a scale - free directed network with properties being rather similar to the www .",
    "the networks and their google matrices are obtained on the basis of the ulam method for coarse - graining of the perron - frobenius operator and thus can be viewed as the ulam networks or ulam graphs .",
    "the google matrix of such ulam networks reproduces many properties of real networks with an algebraic decay of the pagerank and quasi - degeneracy of eigenvalues near unity for the google parameter @xmath104 . in this formulation",
    "the popular websites correspond to dynamical fixed point attractors which help to generate global scale - free properties of the network .",
    "the pagerank of the system becomes delocalized for @xmath0 smaller than a certain critical value , such a delocalization is linked to emergence of a strange attractor . even for",
    "@xmath0 very close to unity a moderate change of system parameters can drive the system to a strange attractor regime with a complete delocalization of the pagerank making the google search inefficient . in view of a great importance of the google search for www @xcite and its new emerging applications @xcite it may be rather useful to study in more detail the properties of the google matrix generated by simple dynamical maps .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that at the present state the google matrix of www is more stable in respect to variation of @xmath0 ( indications for that can be found e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "however , www evolves with time and may become more sensitive to changes of @xmath0 .",
    "also the google search can be applied to a large variety of other important networks ( see e.g. @xcite ) which may be more sensitive to various parameter variations .",
    "it is quite possible that the ulam networks discussed here only partially simulate the properties of the www .",
    "however , the ulam networks are easy to generate and at the same time they show a large variety of rich interesting properties .",
    "the parallels between the ulam networks and the actual www can be instructive for deeper understanding of both .",
    "therefore , we think that their further studies will give us better understanding of the google matrix properties . the studies of the ulam networks will also lead to a better understanding of intricate spectral properties of the perron - frobenius operators . the application of the thermodynamical formalism @xcite to the spectra of such operators can help to understand their properties in a better way .",
