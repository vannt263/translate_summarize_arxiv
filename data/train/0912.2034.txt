    "further understanding could be provided with molecular dynamics calculations that describe the evolution of an atomic system submitted to thermal annealing .",

    "in a first step , a model of graphene on sic(0001 ) is constructed . for the sake of simplicity",

    "the global agreement of the two calculations leads us to the conclusion that this empirical potential is perfectly suited for the study of graphene on sic .",
    "the level of order of the superstructure is even more pronounced , due to the methodology developed to find the minimum despite an empirical physical description of atomic interactions .",
    "if in this case , _ ab initio _ calculations were still affordable , the use of an empirical description will be essential to study larger systems with surface steps or perform molecular dynamics simulations at a given temperature in order to investigate the mechanism of si sublimation that results in the formation of graphene .",
    "in conclusion , the bonding of the graphene buffer layer to the si - terminated surface of sic has been studied using a modified version of the interatomic potential edip .",
    "the difficulty to find the equilibrium configuration has been emphasized , and a dedicated procedure has been developed in order to produce a starting configuration on the way to the minimum .",
    "the result presents high level of order and symmetry , with an hexagonal pattern formed of sticked circular and triangular regions and unbonded rods to release the misfit .",
    "the structure is coherent with the result obtained using an _ ab initio _ description and presents all the symetries identified in experiments .",
    "the physical description is therefore validated for further study on the graphitization process ."
