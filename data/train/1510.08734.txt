    "during the last few years , tremendous development in the ability to control ultra - cold gases , characterised by long - ranged dipolar interactions , confined in optical lattices @xcite has taken place .",
    "in particular , surprising results have been achieved in quantum gases composed of rydberg atoms @xcite , polar molecules @xcite or lanthanides such as erbium ( er ) @xcite .    from a theoretical perspective , long - range magnetic or electric dipolar interactions are considered as chief candidates for observing and controlling novel phases in quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "one of these phases is known as supersolidity , featuring both diagonal and off - diagonal order @xcite . as is well known , the interaction among defects is a key ingredient for driving such an intriguing phase .",
    "although in a quantum regime the defect interaction is still a problem not entirely understood in detail , it appears well established as , in some cases , supersolidity yields as a result of defects delocalisation @xcite . considering a classical regime",
    "only , some authors have emphasised that the effective defect interactions in a self - assembled crystal can be tuned from attractive to repulsive using an external periodic superlattice @xcite .    concerning a quantum regime ,",
    "recent studies have pointed out that the supersolid phase can be observed in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "for example , pollet _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied a complete phase diagram of a two - dimensional system composed of cold polar molecules on a triangular lattice .",
    "the authors proposed a phase diagram that featured a crystal , a superfluid , and , more important , a supersolid phase .",
    "however , even if these studies have improved knowledge of the concept of supersolidity remarkably , they still remain focused on single - band lattice models .",
    "quantum phases using approximations that take into account higher bands still remain a subject to be understood in full @xcite .    in this paper , we present the results concerning a boson dipolar system in continuous space where a potential lattice is imposed , in other words removing the usual tight - binding condition .",
    "in such a continuous limit , the band structure is not completely formed , roughly depending on the potential depth .    using exact quantum monte carlo methods",
    ", we studied the many - body system investigating different lattice depths and dipolar interaction strengths , considering a filling factor around @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the behaviour of the dipolar systems in shallow lattices changed drastically considering a commensurate and an incommensurate filling of the lattice potential . in the first case one can observe a simple superfluid - to - crystal quantum phase transition , as already discussed in refs",
    "concerning the second situation , incommensurability features a defect - induced supersolidity , as originally proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the article is organised as follows : in the section  [ sec2 ] we present the model hamiltonian and the quantum monte carlo methods applied .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section  [ sec3 ] . in particular",
    ", section  [ sec3a ] refers to the ground state configuration , while section  [ sec3b ] is devoted to a regime of finite temperature .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec4 ] a number of conclusions are presented .",
    "we considered an ensemble of bosons interacting via a dipole - dipole potential confined in a two - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "the system is described by a quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian as follows @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of a single particle , while @xmath3 is the distance between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 represents the characteristic strength of the interaction between two dipoles .",
    "the last term of the hamiltonian refers to an optical triangular lattice potential @xmath7\\ ] ] with @xmath8 being the lattice depth and @xmath9 the optical lattice constant . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we defined distances and energies in units of @xmath10 .    as mentioned before , the model proposed in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) was investigated using a quantum monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we sampled the density matrix of the system employing a path integral representation in continuous space .",
    "our code was based on the well - known worm algorithm @xcite . over the last decade , this technique has been successfully implemented for studying the quantum properties of different bosonic systems @xcite .",
    "an all - inclusive discussion of this methodology is provided in ref .",
    "moreover , as pointed out lately @xcite , the employment of repulsive dipolar interactions combined with trapping potentials does not involve any particular pathology throughout the sampling stage .",
    "the worm algorithm efficiently furnishes a numerically _ exact _ estimation of the statistical observables , such as , for instance , energy per particle , density distributions and superfluid fraction . in accordance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we defined the last estimator as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the winding number along the optical lattice in equation ( [ oplat])in and @xmath14 is the number of particles of the ensemble considered .",
    "we used up to @xmath15 particles and about 650 sites in order to exclude any finite - size effects .",
    "even if the algorithm works at finite temperature , an accurate extrapolation of the ground state limit ( i.e. @xmath16 ) may be reached as well . as a general rule ,",
    "this limit is approached when the structural and energetic properties of the system remain constant within the statistical error of the simulation .",
    "the phase diagram of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath17 has been intensively investigated over the last few years . at present , there is a general consensus that this phase diagram only presents a melting quantum phase transition from a triangular crystal to a homogeneous superfluid @xcite .",
    "the crystal - superfluid quantum phase transition results seem to be easily controlled by adjusting the dimensionless parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the averaged interparticle distance of the purely continuous system .",
    "et al . _ have identified the transition at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some aspects related to the transition order continue to be controversial . in particular , as discussed by spivak and kivelson @xcite , at the interface between the two phases , the system should feature a microemulsion phase . using a variational quantum monte carlo @xcite , moroni and boninsegni have recently pointed out that  for all practical purposes \" @xcite , the transition results of the first order , with a coexisting phase ( microemulsion ) mainly inaccessible for any possible experiment .    differently from the case",
    "just discussed , the limit @xmath21 presents a more complex but also more interesting phase diagram . here , between a superfluid and a crystal phase , pollet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identified a supersolid phase as well as a microemulsion as proposed in ref .",
    "the authors found that for a commensurate filling factor @xmath0 ( @xmath22 typically being the ratio between simulated particles and lattice size ) , the system displayed diagonal and off - diagonal long - range order concurrently .    in order to observe a supersolid phase , in this study we were interested in analysing the unexplored limit of finite @xmath8 , considering again the filling values @xmath0 ( commensurate filling ) and @xmath231/3 ( noncommensurate filling ) .",
    "the non - commensurate filling case was studied by introducing an interstitials density ranging from 0.02 to 0.04 .",
    "in addition , we focued our attention on the limit @xmath24 , in other words far from a free - space triangular lattice phase .",
    "-plane , for a system of dipolar bosons confined in a two - dimensional optical lattice with equation  ( [ oplat ] ) .",
    "the dots represent the 325 sites , in other words the potential minimum .",
    "the interaction is @xmath25 and the lattice depth is @xmath26 .",
    "( a ) @xmath27 ( no defects ) , and ( b ) @xmath28 ( density defect 0.036 ) . ]    figure  [ cofings ] depicts snapshots of the projection of world lines onto the @xmath29-plane for @xmath0 ( figure  [ cofings]a ) , with a density of defects ( interstitials ) equal to 0.036 ( figure  [ cofings]b ) .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath305 ) while the lattice depth corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "the representation in figure  [ cofings ] provides a functional way to sketch out the probability distribution of the many - body system in real space @xcite . below a superfluid transition temperature",
    ", the overlap of paths entails exchanges among bosons and superfluidity too .",
    "we observe in figure  [ cofings]a that particle paths are completely confined around the local minima of the lattice potential ( [ oplat ] ) , showing a stripe crystal ground state configuration .",
    "the situation changes if one introduces defects .",
    "figure  [ cofings]b depicts a configuration whereby a localised path occurs with delocalised ones .",
    "this coexistence implies the presence of a supersolid phase .",
    "( square ) , 3.34 ( circle ) , 5 ( diamond ) and 6.67 ( triangle ) . ]    figure  [ superfluid ] shows the superfluid fraction @xmath31 versus @xmath8 , considering the different values of @xmath32 , again for a commensurate ( figure  [ superfluid]a ) and an incommensurate ( figure  [ superfluid]b ) sample , respectively .",
    "analysing figure  [ superfluid]a , we see that only for @xmath33 the dipolar system persists in being superfluid ( @xmath34 ) over all the @xmath8 considered .",
    "however , by increasing @xmath32 we obtain a simple drop of the superfluid estimator from one ( homogeneous superfluid ) to zero ( crystal ) when the lattice depth turns deeper .",
    "such behaviour signalises a simple superfluid - to - insulating - crystal quantum phase transition .",
    "the snapshot configuration in figure  [ cofings]a is a representative example that shows how the lattice is forcing a crystal phase onto the system .",
    "in fact , for @xmath17 we have observed a superfluid phase for all the @xmath32 considered .",
    "figure  [ superfluid]b shows simulations introducing defects , again for different @xmath32 . here for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we notice that the presence of defects seems to remove only the transition , leaving the superfluid phase unchanged .",
    "moreover , for interaction strengths @xmath37 and 6.67 , @xmath31 does not show any fundamental changing with respect to the commensurate case . yet , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the ground state superfluidity leads to a @xmath40 superfluid behaviour , characterised by @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this set of parameters allows the system to move into a supersolid phase , as shown in figures  [ cofings]b .     for a crystal phase ( dashed line ) and a supersolid phase ( continuous line ) , using the same set of parameters as in figure  [ cofings ] . ]",
    "figure  [ gr ] reports the two - point density correlation function @xmath42 .",
    "such a function provides more qualitative information on a liquid or crystal phase .",
    "the figure still compares a commensurate ( dashed line ) and an incommensurate ( continuous line ) filling value , respectively . in either case",
    "the system perfectly mimics the lattice periodicity , with the first maximum representing the averaged interparticle distance for a stripe crystal .",
    "regarding the supersolid phase ( continuous line ) , @xmath42 still presents a robust modulation that becomes smoother at large distances due to a strong particle delocalisation throughout the lattice .       with a defect density equal to 0.036 considering @xmath43 ( a ) and @xmath26 ( b ) .",
    "@xmath28 ( open diamond ) and 212 ( full diamond ) . ]    now we discuss the temperature effects on the supersolid phase observed in figure  [ cofings]b and  [ superfluid]b .",
    "as one would expect , the stability of the condensate at finite temperature is a key feature for supporting realistic experiments . in order to clarify the behaviour in temperature , figure  [ fst ] depicts the superfluid fraction as a function of temperature , for @xmath43 ( figure  [ fst]a ) and 8 ( figure  [ fst]b ) , respectively . in accordance with figure  [ superfluid]b ,",
    "we take into account a dipole strength ( @xmath38 ) that furnishes a nonhomogeneous superfluidity for @xmath44 .",
    "we defined a reduced temperature @xmath45 , @xmath46 being the kinetic energy at the mean interparticle distance .",
    "considering first @xmath43 for an ensemble of @xmath28 dipoles , one sees that @xmath31 remains constant ( @xmath470.75 ) up to @xmath48 , revealing a critical behaviour at finite @xmath49 ( temperature phase transition ) .",
    "this , therefore , appears as entirely consistent with the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thoules ( bkt ) theory for a two - dimensional system with a continuous symmetry @xcite .",
    "it is well known that for a homogeneous gas of bosons , the transition temperature can be estimated at @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fst]b shows that this approximation yields a bkt regime for @xmath51 .",
    "the lowering of the bkt regime in temperature is strictly connected with the interaction strength showed in figure  [ fst ] , consistent with the results discussed in ref .",
    "figure  [ superfluid]b shows a similar physics for @xmath52 but with a lower superfluid fraction in the ground state ( @xmath470.22 ) .",
    "we observe that in the supersolid region , @xmath8 appears to influence @xmath53 only mildly .",
    "this , actually , is an interesting feature of dipolar bosons in an optical lattice . for @xmath54",
    ", we do not observe any superfluidity ( and consequently any @xmath53 ) , leading to the onset of a crystal phase .",
    "these results seem to be consistent with a first - order phase transition .",
    "it is worthwhile stressing that a crystal - to - supersolid first - order phase transition has been observed also for ultra - cold soft - core bosons @xcite and for dipolar bosons in triangular lattices @xcite as well .    finally , in order to exclude finite size effects , figure  [ fst ] compares two different system sizes , @xmath28 ( open diamond ) and @xmath55 ( full diamond ) .",
    "it clearly appears that superfluidity at finite temperature does not change within the statistical errors for both sizes .",
    "in this study we considered a two - dimensional dipolar bosonic gas in the presence of a weak triangular optical lattice .",
    "the results were obtained using an exact quantum monte carlo that implements the worm algorithm in continuous space .",
    "different from previous studies , we investigated a hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) modifying the depth of the optical lattice ( [ oplat ] ) and the strength of the dipole - dipole interactions . regarding a commensurate filling , we observed that the presence of a periodic potential did not change the phase diagram of the system for @xmath17 , in other words where the quantum gas simply shows a crystal - to - superfluid quantum phase transition .",
    "in contrast , the introduction of defects into the system was found to allow a clear defect - induced supersolidity .",
    "we also verified that this phase remained thoroughly solid even at finite temperature .",
    "finally , the supersolid mechanism here discussed fully agrees with the original definition of supersolid phase given by andreev and lifshitz @xcite . in this limit of density",
    ", our results therefore proved that the experimental realisation of this long - sought quantum phase can also be made using quantum dipolar gases in optical lattices ."
