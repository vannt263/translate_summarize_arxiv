    "the determination of constructible numbers with origami is a problem with an interesting development , that was completely solved only after the axiomatization proposed by huzita - justin ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the work by alpering - lang ( @xcite ) proved that the list of possible one - fold axioms was complete and settled a new scenario , where the role of new axioms was still emphasized .",
    "the axiomatic viewpoint seems a natural perspective for the study of other geometrical instruments .    in this work we present a general purpose formal language for the axiomatization of geometrical instruments .",
    "our formalization takes into account both the geometric and arithmetic properties of the instruments : the concept of _ tool _ formalizes an instrument as a set of axioms , while the concept of _ map _ formalizes the constructible points and curves of the instrument .",
    "our formalization provides a natural frame to express well - known results , but also leads to new relations between instruments .",
    "the key concepts of our language are introduced in section 2 . in section @xmath0 , we define _ geometric equivalence _ and _ virtual equivalence of tools _ and prove relations between the tools described in this work . in section @xmath1 we present an equivalence relation between maps and define an _ arithmetical equivalence of tools_. we conclude with an arithmetic classification of the tools described .",
    "a more extended version of this work can be found in @xcite as an evolution of a previous work ( cf .",
