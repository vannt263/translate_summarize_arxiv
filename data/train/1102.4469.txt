    "in this paper we consider the log - convexity of the rate region in 802.11 wlans .",
    "the rate region is defined as the set of achievable throughputs and we begin by noting that the 802.11 rate region is well known to be non - convex . this is illustrated , for example , in figure [ fig : rateregion ] for a simple two - station wlan ( where @xmath0 are described in section  [ sec : nm ] ) .",
    "the shaded region indicates the set of achievable rate pairs ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) where @xmath3 is the throughput of station @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that the maximum throughput achievable by the network when only a single station transmits ( the extreme point along the x- or y - axes ) is greater than that when both stations are active ( e.g. the extreme point along the @xmath6 line ) .",
    "this non - convex behaviour occurs because in 802.11 there is a positive probability of colliding transmissions when multiple stations are active , leading to lost transmission opportunities . in figure",
    "[ fig : lograteregion ] the same data is shown but now replotted as the log rate region , i.e. the set of pairs ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) . evidently , the log rate region is convex .",
    "our main result in this paper is to establish that this behaviour is true in general , not just in this particular example .",
    "that is , although the 802.11 rate region is non - convex , it is nevertheless log - convex . the implications of this for optimisation - based approaches to the design and analysis of fair throughput allocation schemes are discussed after the result .    in a wlan context , rate region properties have mainly been studied for aloha networks .",
    "the log - convexity of the aloha rate region in general mesh network settings has been established by several authors @xcite in the context of utility optimisation .",
    "all of these results make the standard aloha assumption of equal idle and busy slot durations , whereas in 802.11 wlans highly unequal slot durations are the norm e.g. it is not uncommon to have busy slot durations that are 100 times larger than the phy idle slot duration .",
    "this is key to improving throughput efficiency but also fundamentally alters other throughput properties since the mean mac slot duration and achieved rate are now strongly coupled .",
    "we note that a number of recent papers have considered algorithms that seek to achieve certain fair solutions ( proportionally fair , max - min fair ) in 802.11 networks , e.g see @xcite and references therein . for the wlan scenario in this paper",
    "we show how existence and uniqueness of fair solutions follows from log - convexity .",
    "stations and @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( i.e. for packet sizes where the packet transmission duration is 10 times larger than the phy idle slot duration ) . ]    . ]",
    "the 802.11e standard extends and subsumes the standard 802.11 dcf ( distributed coordinated function ) contention mechanism by allowing the adjustment of mac parameters that were previously fixed . with 802.11 , on detecting the wireless medium to be idle for a period @xmath11 , each station initializes a counter to a random number selected uniformly in the set \\{0 , ... , cw-1 } where cw is the contention window .",
    "time is slotted and this counter is decremented once for each slot that the medium is idle .",
    "an important feature is that the countdown halts when the medium becomes busy and only resumes after the medium is idle again for a period @xmath11 . on the counter reaching zero , the station transmits a packet .",
    "if a collision occurs ( two or more stations transmit simultaneously ) , cw is set to @xmath12 and the process repeated . on a successful transmission , cw is reset to the value @xmath13 and a new countdown starts for the next packet .",
    "again , each packet transmission in this phase includes the time spent waiting for an acknowledgement from the receiver .",
    "the 802.11e mac enables the values of @xmath11 ( called @xmath14 in 802.11e ) , @xmath13 and @xmath15 to be set on a per class basis for each station . throughout this paper",
    "we restrict attention to situations where @xmath14 has the legacy value @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , 802.11e adds a txop mechanism that specifies the duration during which a station can keep transmitting without releasing the channel once it wins a transmission opportunity . in order not to release the channel , a sifs interval is inserted between each packet - ack pair .",
    "a successful transmission round consists of multiple packets and acks . by adjusting this time",
    ", the number of packets that may be transmitted by a station at each transmission opportunity can be controlled .",
    "a salient feature of the txop operation is that , if a large txop is assigned and there are not enough packets to be transmitted , the txop period is ended immediately to avoid wasting bandwidth .",
    "we consider an 802.11e wlan with @xmath16 stations . as described in @xcite , we divide time into mac slots , where each mac slot may consist either of a phy idle slot , a successful transmission or a colliding transmission ( where more than one station attempts to transmit simultaneously ) .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the probability that station @xmath4 attempts a transmission .",
    "the mean throughput of station @xmath4 is then shown in @xcite to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21^t$ ] , @xmath22 is the mean frame payload size at station @xmath4 in bits and @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the phy idle slot duration , @xmath25 is the duration of a successful transmission ( including time to transmit the data frame , receive the mac ack and wait for difs ) and @xmath26 the duration of a collision . in this paper",
    "we prove useful analytical properties of the throughput expression ( [ eq : tput_exp ] ) .",
    "it will prove useful to work in terms of the quantity @xmath27 rather than @xmath17 . with this transformation",
    "we have that @xmath28 and @xmath29 and so @xmath30    _ rate region_. the rate region is the set @xmath31 of achievable throughput vectors @xmath32^t$ ] as the vector @xmath33 of attempt probabilities ranges over domain @xmath34\\times\\cdots\\times[0,\\bar{\\tau}_n]$ ] , where @xmath35 denotes the @xmath4th element of vector @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "in this paper we assume that the value of @xmath17 can be freely selected in the interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "this is a mild assumption .",
    "for example , suppose @xmath15 is set equal to @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the probability that there is a packet available for transmission when the station wins a transmission opportunity and so is related to the packet arrival rate .",
    "when a station is saturated we have @xmath42 .",
    "we note that the value @xmath41 here is similar to the quantity in @xcite also referred to as @xmath41 . by adjusting @xmath41 ( via the packet arrival process ) and/or @xmath13 , it can be seen that the value of @xmath17 can be controlled as required .",
    "_ log - convexity_. recall that a set @xmath43 is convex if for any @xmath44 and @xmath45 , there exists an @xmath46 such that @xmath47 . a set @xmath48 is log - convex if the set @xmath49 is convex .",
    "we begin in this section by assuming that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the all 1 s vector .",
    "this assumption is relaxed later on . for convenience we set @xmath52 with",
    "@xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the throughput expression can now be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57    we know that the rate region @xmath58 may be non - convex , but ask whether it is log - convex .",
    "let @xmath59^t$ ] .",
    "the rate region @xmath58 is log - convex if @xmath60 and @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 such that @xmath63 rearranging terms we get for every @xmath64 , @xmath65 note that here we restrict @xmath33 to @xmath66 rather than @xmath67^n$ ] .",
    "this involves no loss of generality since @xmath68 is a continuous function of @xmath33 .",
    "note that the @xmath69 term in ( [ eq : tput ] ) cancels on both sides of ( [ eq : sdef ] ) so the log - convexity result is independent of this term .",
    "we proceed by postulating that @xmath70 is of the form @xmath71 as the right side of ( [ eq : first ] ) does not depend on any particular @xmath4 .",
    "the log - convexity question is whether we can find @xmath72 satisfying @xmath73 substituting from ( [ eq : soln ] ) into ( [ eq : delta ] ) , then using the first expression in ( [ eq : xdef ] ) , and defining @xmath74 , we will need to solve for a @xmath75 such that @xmath76 recalling hlders inequality for two non - negative vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have using the second expression in ( [ eq : xdef ] ) that the right - hand side of ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) is positive and lower bounded by @xmath80 choosing @xmath81 it can be seen that this lower bound lies within the range of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) .",
    "considering the left - hand side of ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) in more detail , its second derivative is given by @xmath82 where product over an empty set is defined to be @xmath83 .",
    "since the second - derivative is positive for @xmath84 , it implies the ( strict ) convexity of the left - hand side of ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) . this quantity is unbounded and has range that includes @xmath85 .",
    "it follows that there exists a positive @xmath86 satisfying ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) , as required . indeed ,",
    "in general there may exist two values of @xmath86 solving ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) . to see this",
    "observe that the left -hand side is unbounded both as @xmath87 and as @xmath88 .",
    "the first - derivative is negative as @xmath87 and positive as @xmath89 , so we have a turning point @xmath90 , which due to the convexity of the function is unique .",
    "this turning point partitions the real line and two solutions to ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) then exist , one lying in @xmath91 and the other in @xmath92 .",
    "additionally , this argument also says that there exists at least one solution of ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) where @xmath93 .",
    "we have therefore established the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : one ] the rate region @xmath58 is log - convex .      we can extend the foregoing analysis to situations where the station attempt probability is constrained , i.e. the vector @xmath33 of attempt probabilities ranges over @xmath34\\times\\cdots\\times[0,\\bar{\\tau}_n]$ ] , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 . note that an upper bound on @xmath17 of @xmath35 results in an upper bound @xmath95 on @xmath96 .",
    "therefore if @xmath97 , then @xmath98\\times\\cdots\\times[0,\\bar{\\tau}_n/(1-\\bar{\\tau})_1]$ ] and for every @xmath99 $ ] we also have @xmath100 . from the proof of theorem  [ thm : one ] we know that there exists at least one @xmath93 that solves ( [ eq : soln2 ] ) . using that solution",
    "we find that @xmath101 so that @xmath102 .",
    "note that we can have different values of @xmath35 for every @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we have the following corollary to theorem  [ thm : one ] .",
    "the rate region @xmath31 is log - convex for every @xmath103^n$ ] .",
    "these log - convexity results allow us to immediately apply powerful optimisation results to the analysis and design of fair throughput allocations for 802.11 wlans . first , using ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) , the existence of a max - min fair solution immediately follows .",
    "we also have that any optimisation of the form @xmath104 can be converted into an optimisation @xmath105 where @xmath106 ( so , in particular , @xmath107 ) , @xmath59^t$ ] , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "provided @xmath110 and the @xmath111 are convex functions , the optimisation is a convex problem to which standard tools can then be applied . from this point of view",
    "it now follows that we can naturally extend the congestion and contention control ideas of @xcite to the more general scenario considered in @xcite .    in particular , for the standard family of utility fairness functions given for @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 by @xmath115 we have @xmath116 is concave for all @xmath117 . in the @xmath118 case",
    "we also get strict concavity of @xmath119 , and the existence and uniqueness of utility fair solutions immediately follows from our log - convexity result . for @xmath120",
    "an analysis of the boundary of the log rate - region also allows one to show uniqueness of the solution in the case of @xmath121 .",
    "in this paper we establish the log - convexity of the rate region in 802.11 wlans .",
