    "motivated by the construction of several gravitational wave detectors ( ligo , geo600 , tama300 and virgo ) great efforts have been conducted in the past years to compute the waves generated by binary black holes .",
    "we presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) a new method for getting quasi - stationary spacetimes representing binary black holes in circular orbits .",
    "see also paper i for a review on issues and previous works in this field .    the basic approximation is to assume the existence of an helical killing vector  : = + , where @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) is a timelike ( resp .",
    "spacelike ) vector which coincides asymptotically with the time coordinate ( resp .",
    "azimuthal coordinate ) vector of an asymptotically inertial observer .",
    "basically , it means that the two black holes are on circular orbits with orbital velocity @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is of course not exact because the emission of gravitational waves will cause the two holes to spiral toward each other . but",
    "this is a valid approximation as long as the time - scale of the gravitational radiation is much longer than the orbital period , which should be true , at least for large separations .",
    "the existence of @xmath3 enables us to get rid of any time evolution .",
    "we use the standard 3 + 1 decomposition of the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to a space metric that is conformally flat , i.e. of the form  : = ^4 , where @xmath4 is a scalar field and @xmath5 denotes the flat 3-metric @xcite .",
    "let us mention that the exact spacetime should differ from conformal flatness and that this assumption is only introduced for simplification and should be removed from later works .",
    "however it is important to note that it is consistent with the existence of the helical killing vector and the assumption of asymptotic flatness .",
    "the ten einstein equations then reduce to five equations , one for the lapse function @xmath6 , one for the conformal factor @xmath4 and three for the shift vector @xmath7 ( see paper i for derivation )  :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes covariant derivative associated with @xmath5 and @xmath10 the ordinary laplace operator .",
    "@xmath11 is the reduced extrinsic curvature tensor related to @xmath12 by @xmath13 and given by [ e : def_a ] ^ij = ( l)^ij , @xmath14 denoting the conformal killing operator applied to the shift vector ( l)^ij : = |d^i ^j + |d^j ^i -|d_k ^k f^ij .",
    "equations ( [ e : eq_lapse ] ) , ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) and ( [ e : eq_psi ] ) are a set of five strongly elliptic equations that are coupled .",
    "to solve such a system , we must impose boundary conditions . to recover the minkowski spacetime at spatial infinity , i.e. asymptotical flatness",
    ", the fields must have the following behaviors  :    @xmath15    as we wish to obtain solutions representing two black holes and not minkowski spacetime , we must impose a non - trivial spacetime topology . in paper",
    "i , we define the topology to be that of the real line @xmath16 times the 3-dimensional misner - lindquist manifold @xcite ; this defines two throats , being two disjointed spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 of radii @xmath19 and @xmath20 , centered on points @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( such that @xmath23 ) .",
    "following misner @xcite , lindquist@xcite , kulkarny _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , cook _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and others @xcite , we demand that the two sheets of the misner - lindquist manifold are isometric .",
    "moreover we choose the lapse function @xmath6 to be antisymmetric with respect to this isometry .",
    "we solve the einstein equations only for the `` upper '' sheet , i.e. only for the space exterior to the throats , with boundary conditions given by  :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the radial coordinates associated with spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "equations ( [ e : bound_lapse ] ) reflect the antisymmetry of the lapse function @xmath6 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the shift vector , given by eqs .",
    "( [ e : bound_beta ] ) , represent two black holes in _ corotation _",
    "( rotation synchronized with the orbital motion ) , which is the only case studied in this paper .",
    "those boundary conditions should be easily changed to represent other states of rotation ( like _ irrotation _ ) .",
    "equations ( [ e : bound_psi ] ) come from the isometry solely .",
    "the orbital velocity @xmath2 only appears in the boundary condition for the shift ( see eq .",
    "( [ e : beta_infinity ] ) ) . equations ( [ e : eq_lapse ] ) , ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) and ( [ e : eq_psi ] ) can be solved for any value of @xmath2 .",
    "so we need an extra condition to fix the right value for @xmath2 .",
    "this is done by imposing that , at spatial infinity , the metric behaves like a schwarzschild metric , i.e. by imposing that @xmath27 has no monopolar term in @xmath28  : [ e : condition_omega ] ^2 n ~1 + r. in other words , @xmath2 is chosen so that the adm and the `` komar - like '' masses coincides , those masses being given by @xmath29 as shown in @xcite and in paper  i this is closely linked to the virial theorem for stationary spacetimes .",
    "we will see later that this uniquely determines the orbital velocity , and that this velocity tends to the keplerian one at large separation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ s : numerical ] is dedicated to the presentation of the numerical scheme , that is based on multi - domain spectral methods . in sec . [",
    "s : tests ] we present some tests passed by the code , which encompass comparison with the schwarzschild and kerr black hole and the misner - lindquist solution @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ s : sequence ] we present results about a sequence of binary black holes in circular orbits .",
    "in particular we locate the innermost stable circular orbit and compare its location with other works .",
    "[ s : conclusion ] is concerned with extension of this work , for getting more complicated and more realistic results .",
    "the numerical treatments used to solve the elliptic equations presented above is based on the same methods that we already successfully applied to binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the sources of the equations being mainly concentrated around each hole we use two sets of polar coordinates centered around each throat ( see sec . [",
    "s : introduction ] ) .",
    "note however that the tensorial basis of decomposition is a cartesian one .",
    "for example , a vector field @xmath30 will be given by its components on the cartesian basis @xmath31 but each component is a function of the polar coordinates @xmath32 with respect to the center of one hole or the other .",
    "we use spectral methods to solve the elliptic equations presented in sec .",
    "[ s : introduction ] ; the fields are given by their expansion onto some basis functions .",
    "mainly , we use expansion on spherical harmonics with respect to the angles @xmath33 and chebyshev polynomials for the radial coordinate .",
    "let us mention that there exists two equivalent descriptions : a function can be given in the _ coefficient space _ ,",
    "i.e. by the coefficients of its spectral expansion , or in the _ configuration space _ by specifying its value at some collocation points @xcite .",
    "the sources of the elliptic equations being non - compactly supported , we must use a computational domain extending to infinity .",
    "this is done by dividing space into several types of domains  :    * a _ kernel _ , a sphere containing the origin of the polar coordinates centered on one of the throats . * several spherical _ shells _ extending to finite radius .",
    "* a _ compactified domain _ extending to infinity by the use of the computational coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "this technique enables us to choose the basis function so that the fields are regular everywhere , especially on the rotation axis and to impose exact boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "this has been presented with more details elsewhere @xcite .",
    "note that since the last domain extends to spacelike infinity , the surface integrals defining global quantities , such as ( [ e : m_adm ] ) and ( [ e : m_komar ] ) , can be computed without any approximation .",
    "this contrasts with other numerical methods based on finite domains ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .  1 therein ) .",
    "as two different sets of coordinates are used , one centered on each hole , we are left with two computational domains of this type , each describing all space and so overlapping .",
    "the sources of the equations being concentrated around the two throats , we wish to split the total equations ( [ e : eq_psi ] ) , ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) and ( [ e : eq_lapse ] ) into two parts , each being centered mainly around each hole and solved using the associated polar coordinates set .",
    "so an equation of the type @xmath35 will be split into @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 is constructed to be mainly concentrated around hole @xmath40 , and so well described by polar coordinates around this hole .",
    "therefore , the solved equations are  : @xmath41 where the values with no index represent the total values and the values with index @xmath40 represent the values `` mostly '' generated by hole @xmath40",
    "( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) .",
    "for example , we have @xmath44 , @xmath45 being concentrated around hole @xmath40 .",
    "doing so , the physical equations and sources are given by the sum of equations ( [ e : split_psi ] ) , ( [ e : split_beta ] ) and ( [ e : split_lapse ] ) for @xmath42 and @xmath46 .",
    "for more details about such a splitting of the equations into two parts we refer to @xcite .",
    "using spectral methods with spherical harmonics , the resolution of the scalar poisson equation reduces to the inversion of banded matrices .",
    "we already presented in details in @xcite the methods to solve such equations in all space , imposing regularity at the origin and exact boundary condition at infinity . in the case of black holes",
    "we wish to replace the regularity at the origin by boundary conditions on the spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 and to solve only for the part of space exterior to those spheres . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that , for each couple of indices @xmath47 of a particular spherical harmonic , we can calculate one particular solution in each domain , two homogeneous solutions in the shells and only one in the kernel ( due to regularity ) and one in the external domain ( due to boundary condition at infinity ) .",
    "the next step was to determine the coefficients of the homogeneous solutions by imposing that the global solution is @xmath48 at the boundaries between the different domains .    in the case of a single throat @xmath49 , the boundary condition is given by a function of the angles solely , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "one wishes to impose that the solution or its radial derivative is equal to @xmath51 on the sphere which corresponds respectively to a dirichlet or a neumann problem .",
    "we choose the kernel so that its spherical boundary coincides with the throat .",
    "so we do not solve in the kernel with represents the interior of the sphere .",
    "@xmath51 is expanded in spherical harmonics and for each couple @xmath47 , we use one of the homogeneous solution in the first shell to fulfill the dirichlet or neumann boundary condition . after that we are left with one particular solution in every domain , one homogeneous solution in the innermost shell and in the external domain and two in the other shells .",
    "the situation is exactly the same as when a solution was sought in all space and the coefficients of the remaining homogeneous solutions are chosen to maintain continuity of the solution and of its first derivative .",
    "so the generalization of the scheme presented in @xcite is straightforward and enables us to solve either the dirichlet or neumann problem , with any boundary condition imposed on the throat .",
    "we presented extensively two different schemes to solve the vectorial poisson equation ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) in all space in @xcite ( the oohara - nakamura @xcite and shibata @xcite schemes ) .",
    "we present here an extension of the so - called oohara - nakamura scheme to impose boundary condition a throat and to solve only for the exterior part of space .",
    "the shibata scheme has not been chosen because , the solution being constructed from auxiliary quantities , it is not obvious at all to impose boundary conditions on it .",
    "this is not the case with the oohara - nakamura scheme where the final solution is calculated directly as the solution of three scalar poisson equations .",
    "more precisely the solution of ( cf .",
    "[ e : split_beta ] ) ^i + |d^i |d_j ^j = v^i (= -1 ) is found by solving the set of three scalar poisson equations [ e : part_beta_vec ] ^i = v^i -|d^i , where @xmath52 is solution of [ e : part_chi_vec ] = |d_i v^i .",
    "let us mention that this scheme should only be used with a source @xmath30 that is continuous .",
    "we use the scalar poisson equation solvers with boundary condition previously described to solve for each cartesian component of ( [ e : part_beta_vec ] ) with the appropriate boundary conditions . but let us recall ( see @xcite ) that the oohara - nakamura scheme is only applicable if [ e : val_chi ] = |d_i ^i and that it only ensures that [ e : delta_chi ] ( -|d_i ^i ) = 0 .",
    "one can easily show that ( [ e : delta_chi ] ) implies ( [ e : val_chi ] ) if and only if [ e : bound_chi ] .",
    "|d_i ^i |_s , which is the boundary condition we must impose during the resolution of ( [ e : part_chi_vec ] ) to use this scheme .",
    "let us mention that @xmath52 being calculated before @xmath7 , we must use some iterative procedure .",
    "we first solve ( [ e : part_chi_vec ] ) with an initial guess of the boundary condition and then determine @xmath7 by solving ( [ e : part_beta_vec ] ) . using that value",
    ", we can determine a new boundary condition for @xmath52 , using ( [ e : bound_chi ] ) , and so a new @xmath7 .",
    "this procedure is repeated until it has sufficiently converged .",
    "the obtained @xmath7 is then solution of the vectorial poisson equation with either a dirichlet or neumann type boundary condition on the sphere @xmath49 .      in order to illustrate how boundary conditions are put on the two spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "let us concentrate on the dirichlet problem for the scalar poisson equation .",
    "one wishes to solve [ e : poisson_split_bound ] f = g , with the boundary conditions @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are arbitrary functions . as explained in sec .",
    "[ s : split ] , the total equation is split into two parts @xmath56 the equation labeled @xmath42 or @xmath43 , being solved on the grid centered around hole @xmath40 so that the sphere @xmath57 coincides with the innermost boundary of the first shell .    during the first step we solve eqs .",
    "( [ e : part_un ] ) and ( [ e : part_deux ] ) with the boundary conditions @xmath58 by means of the scalar poisson equation solver described in sec .",
    "[ s : scal_poisson ] .",
    "doing so , the total solution @xmath59 does not fulfill the boundary conditions ( [ e : bound_tot_un])-([e : bound_tot_deux ] ) .",
    "so we calculate the values of @xmath60 on the sphere @xmath18 and modify the boundary condition ( [ e : bound_auto_deux ] ) by @xmath61 .",
    "the same modification is done with the boundary condition ( [ e : bound_auto_un ] ) .",
    "then we solve once again for @xmath60 and @xmath62 .",
    "the whole procedure is repeated until a sufficient convergence is achieved .",
    "so we are left with a function @xmath63 which is solution of the poisson equation ( [ e : poisson_split_bound ] ) and which fulfills a given dirichlet - type boundary condition on two spheres ( [ e : bound_tot_un])-([e : bound_tot_deux ] ) .",
    "the same thing can be done for the neumann problem by modifying the boundary conditions using the radial derivatives of the functions @xmath64 .",
    "the same technique is applied for the vectorial poisson equation .",
    "let us mention that the iteration on the boundary conditions for @xmath7 , resulting from the presence of the two spheres , is done at the same time than the one on the quantity @xmath52 resulting from to the oohara - nakamura scheme ( see sec .",
    "[ s : vect_poisson ] ) .",
    "as seen in the previous section , we can solve elliptic equations with various boundary conditions in all the space exterior to two non - intersecting spheres @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "but a problem arises from the iterative nature of the total numerical procedure .",
    "suppose that after a particular step the lapse @xmath65 has been calculated by means of the two poisson equations ( [ e : split_lapse ] ) .",
    "from the very procedure of the elliptic solvers , @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 ) is known everywhere outside sphere @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) . if the next equation to be solved is the one for the shift vector split like ( [ e : split_beta ] ) , @xmath6 appears in the source term .",
    "we need to know the source everywhere outside the associated sphere @xmath57 ( @xmath68 ) which includes the interior of the other sphere .",
    "so we must construct fields that are known in the all space .",
    "after each resolution , the fields are filled as smoothly as possible inside the associated sphere . in our example , after the resolution of ( [ e : split_lapse ] ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are filled inside the spheres , so that the total function @xmath6 is known everywhere .",
    "the filling is performed , for each spherical harmonic @xmath47 , by the following radial function  :    * @xmath69 if @xmath70 is even , * @xmath71 if @xmath70 is odd ,    where the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 are calculated so that the function is @xmath48 across the sphere @xmath57 .",
    "the multiplication by the polynomial @xmath74 ensures that the function is rather regular at the origin .",
    "of course this choice of filling is not unique and the final result should be independent of the filling procedure , the fields outside the spheres depending only on the boundary conditions on those spheres .",
    "the choice of filling may only change the convergence of the numerical scheme .",
    "let us stress that even if the fields are known , regular and @xmath48 everywhere , they have a physical meaning only outside the throats .",
    "the filling is only introduced for numerical purposes .",
    "when one imposes corotation for the two black holes , that is a vanishing shift vector on the throats , isometry conditions ( 59 ) , ( 60 ) and ( 61 ) of paper i are trivially fulfilled .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case for ( 62 ) and ( 63 ) of paper i. we must find a way to impose that [ e : isometric ] .",
    "|_s_i = 0 .",
    "|_s_i = 0 in order to get a truly isometric solution .",
    "another problem comes from the computation of the reduced extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath11 by means of ( [ e : def_a ] ) . because of division by @xmath75 on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , we must impose that [ e : condition_regul ] .",
    "( l)^ij|_s_1 = 0 and .",
    "( l)^ij|_s_2 = 0 , so that the extrinsic curvature tensor is regular everywhere .",
    "because of the rigidity conditions ( [ e : bound_beta ] ) and for a truly isometric solution verifying ( [ e : isometric ] ) , the regularity conditions ( [ e : condition_regul ] ) are fulfilled if and only if [ e : derivee_beta ] . |_s_1 = 0 and . |_s_2 = 0 .",
    "so , to get a truly isometric and regular solution , both the value and the radial derivative of @xmath7 must be zero on the throats  : .",
    "|_s_i = 0 .",
    "|_s_i = 0 .",
    "but when solving eq .",
    "( [ e : eq_beta ] ) , one can only impose the value at infinity and one of those two conditions , i.e. we can only solve for the dirichlet or neumann problem , not for both .",
    "we choose to solve the equation ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) for the dirichlet boundary condition : @xmath76 on both spheres .",
    "doing so , the regularity conditions ( [ e : derivee_beta ] ) , as well as the remaining isometry conditions ( [ e : isometric ] ) , are not necessarily fulfilled .",
    "after each step we must modify the obtained shift vector to enforce ( [ e : derivee_beta ] ) and ( [ e : isometric ] ) .",
    "the part of the shift generated by the hole @xmath77 is modified by @xmath78 where @xmath25 is the radial coordinate associated with hole @xmath77 , @xmath19 the radius of the throat and @xmath79 an arbitrary radius , typically @xmath80 .",
    "the correction procedure is only applied for @xmath81 .",
    "let us mention that the function of @xmath25 in front of @xmath82 in eq .",
    "( [ e : beta_cor_def ] ) has been chosen so that it maintains the value of the shift vector on the sphere @xmath77 and its continuity ( @xmath48 function ) .",
    "the same operation is done for the other hole .",
    "after regularization , the shift vector satisfies ( i ) the rigidity condition ( [ e : bound_beta ] ) , ( ii ) the isometry conditions ( [ e : isometric ] ) , and ( iii ) the condition ( [ e : derivee_beta ] ) ensuring the regularity of the extrinsic curvature , but it violates slightly the momentum constraint  ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) .    as seen in paper  i , the regularity is a consequence of the equation [ e : div_beta ] |d_i ^i = -6^i|d_i .",
    "because this equation is not part of the system we choose to solve , we do not expect that the correction function is exactly zero at the end of a computation .",
    "but we will verify in sec .",
    "[ s : check_mom ] that it is only a small fraction of the shift vector ( less than @xmath83 ) , fraction which represents the deviation from eq .",
    "( [ e : div_beta ] ) ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an extended discussion ) .",
    "moreover , we will see in sec .",

    ", we can compute the tensor @xmath14 , which is zero on both throats . to calculate the tensor @xmath11",

    "this procedure enables us to compute the extrinsic curvature tensor everywhere , without any problem that could arise from a division by zero .      in the split equations ( [ e : split_lapse ] ) and",

    "the present work should be seen as a first step in trying to give some new insight to the binary black holes problem .",
    "the basic idea is to extend the numerical treatment beyond the resolution of the four constraint equations within a 3-dimensional spacelike surface .",
    "this is achieved by reintroducing time in the problem to deal with a 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the orbits are well defined by imposing the existence of a helical killing vector and the orbital velocity is found as the only value that equals the adm and the komar - like masses , a requirement which is equivalent to the virial theorem . according to us those are the two most important features of our method . the approximation of conformal flatness for the 3-metric has only been used for simplicity . sooner or later this problem will have to be solved using a general spatial metric and outgoing waves boundary conditions at large distances .",
    "the use of the inversion isometry to derive boundary conditions on the throats is also a weak assumption . in the future",
    ", it would be interesting to change the boundary conditions on the fields in order to investigate their influence on the results ( see e.g. @xcite for an alternative choice ) .",
    "besides , changing the boundary conditions on the shift vector should enable us to describe other states of rotation of the black holes , as has been recently proposed by cook  @xcite .",
    "the numerical schemes are basically the same as those which have been previously successfully applied to binary neutron stars configurations @xcite .",
    "they have been extended to solve elliptic equations with non - trivial boundary conditions imposed on two throats and exact boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "those techniques passed numerous tests and recover the schwarzschild and kerr solutions as well as the misner - lindquist one for two static black holes @xcite .",
    "a technical problem lies in the great number of coefficients needed to accurately describe the part of the sources located around the companion hole .",
    "this effect causes some lack of precision .",
    "but we can estimate the error it generates by varying the number of coefficients , and comparing the results .",
    "this is what we have done here , using @xmath221 coefficients in each of the 12 domains for the low resolution computations and @xmath222 coefficients for the high resolution ones .",
    "the accuracy , estimated from the generalized smarr formula , is below @xmath186 .",
    "another issue is the slight violation of the momentum constraint which arises from the necessity to regularize the shift vector .",
    "we have found that the modification of the shift vector with respect to the vector which satisfies the momentum constraint ( [ e : eq_beta ] ) is below @xmath83 , and that the error it induces in the momentum constraint equation is of the order @xmath186 . in view of the other approximations performed in this work , especially the conformal flatness of the 3-metric",
    ", we find this to be very satisfactory .    in this article",
    ", we have defined a sequence of binary black holes by requiring that the adm mass decrease is related to the angular momentum decrease via @xmath223 .",
    "this relation is true for the loss due to gravitational radiation , at least when one considers only the quadrupole formula .",
    "we have then found that the area of the apparent horizons ( irreducible mass ) is constant along the sequence , in agreement with the first law of binary black holes thermodynamics recently derived by friedman et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the location of the isco has been obtained and compared with the results from other methods @xcite .",
    "it turns out that our results match the 3-pn methods much better than previous numerical works .",
    "the differences between numerical studies and 3-pn approximations have often been explained by the use of the conformal flatness approximation in the numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "it seems to us that this is not the main explanation , for we are using this approximation .",
    "it certainly arises instead from the way @xmath2 is determined .",
    "another natural extension of this work is to use the obtained configurations as initial data for binary black holes evolution codes ( see @xcite for a review and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent results ) .",
    "initial data files containing the result of the present work are publically available on the cvs repository of the european union network on sources of gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "extraction of the wave - forms from a sequence would also be an interesting application @xcite .",
    "this work has benefited from numerous discussions with luc blanchet , brandon carter , thibault damour , david hobill , jrme novak and keisuke taniguchi .",
