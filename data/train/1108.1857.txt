    "rotating becs combined with a co - rotating ol exhibit a rich variety of vortex phases @xcite , which have two competing length scales : the two lattice spacings , one for the ol and the other for the vortex lattice .",
    "the central role of the ol is to pin vortices at its maxima .",
    "@xcite created a rotating square ol using a rotating mask , which provided a periodic pinning potential that was stationary in the rotating frame associated with the presence of vortices .",

    "figure [ vortexdynamics ] shows the time development of the condensate density for several values of the potential depth @xmath37 . for the shallow ol @xmath48 ,",
    "the dynamics are similar to those without the ol , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vortexdynamics](a ) .",
    "first , the surface of the condensate becomes unstable and generates surface ripples that propagate along the surface .",
    "then , the surface ripples gradually develop into vortex cores , and these vortices are pulled in toward the rotation axis to make a vortex lattice .",
    "the settled vortices are generally pinned by peaks of the ol . for @xmath49 [ fig .",
    "[ vortexdynamics](b ) ] , although vortices are also generated from the surface region , the condensate surface is disrupted to form density blobs rather than excited to form ripples .",
    "the vortices penetrate inside soon after the turn - on of the rotation .",
    "this is because quantized vortices accompany the density dips ( vortex cores ) so that they can easily penetrate into the condensate through the local density suppression caused by maxima of the ol .",
    "as the ol becomes much deeper , the system enters a regime of the josephson - junction array . here",
    ", fractions of the condensate are well localized at the potential minima and the overlap of the wave function between nearest - neighbor sites is very small .",
    "then , the dynamics of the condensate density are completely frozen during the overall vortex nucleation process ; only the phase is a dynamical degree of freedom . a typical example for @xmath50 is shown in fig .  [ vortexdynamics](c ) .",
    "even in this deep lattice , the vortices are nucleated from the periphery and settle very quickly as soon as the rotation is turned on .",

    "we find that this nucleation dynamic occurs for a relatively large lattice spacing @xmath57 . for @xmath54 but @xmath55 ( @xmath58 ) , for example , a different dynamical feature from fig .",
    "[ vortexdynamics](b ) arises as shown in fig .",
    "[ centernuc ] ; some vortices are created from the surface as usual , while others arise from vortex ",
    "antivortex pairs created by peaks of the ol moving inside the condensate .",
    "the phase profile at @xmath59 reveals the pair creation occurring at peaks of the ol [ the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ centernuc ] ] , because these vortices have circulations and anti - circulations of the phase .",
    "then , the anti - vortices quickly disappear by migrating outward and combining with other vortices",
    ". however , some vortices remain in pairs in the condensate and form a vortex lattice together with vortices coming from the condensate surface .",
    "we find that similar dynamics occur for different values of @xmath60 .",
    "this nucleation mechanism is similar to that of dragging the superflow through an obstacle potential @xcite or , more closely , stirring the condensate by a circularly moving narrow potential @xcite .",
    "these different dynamical origins of vortex nucleation can be understood by noting that the density fluctuation is frozen for a deep ol .",
    "this condition can be obtained when the energy spacing @xmath61 of a single well of the ol under the harmonic approximation becomes larger than the typical interaction energy @xmath62 .",
    "then we have @xmath63 for the density to freeze , where @xmath64 is the healing length .",
    "this estimation agrees fairly well with our numerical results because @xmath65 in our parameters ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) . the lattice spacing @xmath70 @xmath32 m employed by williams _",

    "( ii ) for the deep lattice ( @xmath78 ) , the equilibrium vortex number increased linearly as a function of the rotation frequency @xmath3 . this point ( ii ) indicated that the condensate radius @xmath79 was not affected by the centrifugal expansion incidental to a rotating bec in a harmonic potential , see eq .",
    "( [ feynmanrules ] ) below .     for several values of the potential depth @xmath37 .",
    "we count the number of vortices within the radius determined by peripheral sites at which the density peak has 10% of the central peak density .",

    "[ vortexnumber ] we show the vortex number @xmath81 in the equilibrium state as a function of the rotation frequency @xmath3 for several values of @xmath37 .",
    "this result was obtained by the dynamical simulation shown in the previous section with a sufficiently long time evolution to ensure the equilibration .",
    "we can see several features : ( i ) naturally , the vortex number @xmath81 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the experiment , it grows faster than a linear function for all @xmath37 .",
    "( ii ) in contrast with ref .",
    "@xcite , the vortex number @xmath81 also increases with increasing @xmath37 even at the same rotation frequency .",
    "this is because the tight confinement by the deep lattice effectively enhances the condensate radius @xmath79 under the condition of fixed 2d particle number @xcite .",
    "the vortex number thus increases with the radius because the lattice spacing of vortices is fixed by @xmath3 . however , this property is irrelevant to the @xmath3-dependence of @xmath81 , because this 2d artifact only affects the radius at @xmath69 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ vortexnumber ] , when we plot the vortex density taken by the condensate radius at @xmath69 , i.e. @xmath80 , all the plots are almost coincident .",
    "this also supports the feature ( i ) , namely , the scaling of @xmath81 on @xmath3 is independent of @xmath82 .",
    "( iii ) the critical rotation frequency for the first vortex nucleation is decreased as @xmath37 increases .",
    "however , it is still above @xmath83 even for the very deep lattice @xmath50 in contrast with the experiment @xcite . in the following , we consider these issues in more detail .",
    "our first concern is the critical rotation frequency of the vortex nucleation . to support our results ,",
    "we calculate the thermodynamic critical frequency @xmath84 that ensures thermodynamic stability of the stationary state with a single vortex at the origin @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the total energy for the single vortex state and the non - vortex state , respectively , and @xmath87 is the mean angular momentum of the single vortex state . since our ol of eq .",
    "( [ olpote ] ) has a sine form which has a minimum at the origin , we replace it with a cosine form with a maximum at the origin , which is suitable for calculating the energy of the single vortex state pinned at the center .",
    "note that this critical frequency is not relevant for the actual event of vortex nucleation seen in fig .",
    "[ vortexdynamics ] , because the surface instability dominates the vortex nucleation .",
    "nevertheless , we can obtain a lower bound of the critical rotation frequency because the critical rotation frequency @xmath88 associated with the surface instability is typically larger than @xmath89 of eq .",
    "( [ thermocrieq ] ) @xcite .     for the single vortex state as a function of the potential depth @xmath82 .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding energy difference ( numerator of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ thermocrieq ] ) ) and the mean angular momentum per atom ( denominator of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ thermocrieq ] ) ) . ]",
    "figure [ crifre ] shows that the critical rotation frequency @xmath89 decreases very slowly with @xmath37 and does not fall below 0.05 even at @xmath90 .",
    "we find that , although the energy difference @xmath91 decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath37 , @xmath92 also decreases together so that their ratio @xmath89 does not vanish . for sufficiently large @xmath37 ,",
    "there is little energy cost for a vortex to be positioned at the potential maximum , because an almost zero density region extends between the well separated condensate islands at the potential maxima .",
    "correspondingly , the overlap of the wave functions between nearest neighbor sites decreases significantly , which leads to the suppression of the current flowing between the sites .",
    "this reduces the atoms contributing to the mean angular momentum .",
    "thus , the dynamical simulations discussed in sec .  [ dynamics ] can not account for the observation by williams _",
    "@xcite , because the vortices always nucleate from outside of the surface and are prevented from invading into the bulk for @xmath93 . since no vortices were observed in a static ol ( @xmath69 ) @xcite , we can exclude the possibility of vortex nucleation due to thermal activation like the berezenskii  kosterlitz ",
    "thouless mechanism @xcite or interference between uncorrelated becs @xcite .",
    "once vortices nucleate , they are expected to have a long life time because of the strong pinning effect of the ol , even if they are thermodynamically unstable . a more detailed study including the effect of the strong fluctuation of the ol @xcite , or applying a more elaborate model such as the projected gp equation @xcite or stochastic gp equation @xcite to this problem is a challenge for future study .",
    "the second concern is the linear dependence of the vortex number @xmath81 as a function of the rotation frequency @xmath3 . for a superfluid rotating in a rigid container with radius @xmath94",
    ", the vortex number @xmath81 can be determined by feynman s relation @xmath95 @xcite . in the thomas  fermi limit and",

    "this result was expected to be caused by the effect of the ol , where the radial expansion may be suppressed by the small tunneling rate at the peripheral lattice sites because the number of atoms decreases there .",

    "[ vornumfit ] .",

    "intrinsically , @xmath120 should be a nontrivial function of @xmath82 through the typical condensate size @xmath121 along @xmath4-axis , because the condensate can escape along the longitudinal ( @xmath4- ) direction with increasing @xmath82 , which leads to increase in @xmath121 .",
