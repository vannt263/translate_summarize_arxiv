    "physical conditions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) have traditionally been studied using spectral lines from a variety of tracers including the 21  cm line and recombination lines of hydrogen in the radio regime , lyman lines of h  i , the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath1 and the atomic fine - structure lines such as c  i in the uv as well as a host of rotational lines from molecules in the mm wavelength regime .",
    "for example the kinetic temperature of the gas can be determined using either the h  i 21  cm line or the h@xmath1 uv lines , the pressure and cooling rates can be determined from the fine structure lines of c  i and c  ii@xmath6 etc .",
    "since many of these tracers co - exist in the diffuse ism , multi - wavelength observations would allow one to cross check different observational techniques as well as to derive a more complete understanding of the physical state of the ism .",
    "the gas temperature is a particularly well suited example of a parameter that can , in principle , be determined by observations at a variety of wavelengths . in the radio regime ,",
    "the classical method consists of observing the h  i 21-cm line in absorption towards a bright radio continuum source ; this , in conjunction with observations of the emission spectrum along a nearby line of sight allows one to measure the spin temperature ( t@xmath0 ) of the h  i . while the h  i spin temperature , strictly speaking , characterizes the population distribution between the two hyperfine levels of the hydrogen atom , it is often used as a proxy for the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "this is because , in high density regions , t@xmath0 is expected to be tightly coupled to the kinetic temperature via collisions , while in low density regions , resonant scattering of lyman-@xmath7 photons again may couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature @xcite .",
    "uv observations of the lyman and werner bands of h@xmath1 also allow one to determine the gas temperature .",
    "this is the so called `` ortho - para '' temperature ( t@xmath2 ) .",
    "the ortho - para temperature characterizes the population distribution between the ortho and para forms of the h@xmath1 molecule , and like the spin temperature , it too is expected to be coupled to the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "this happens mainly via proton exchange collisions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in regions where h  i and h@xmath1 co - exist",
    ", one might hence expect that the temperatures derived from radio ( i.e. t@xmath0 ) and uv observations ( i.e. t@xmath2 ) should match .",
    "however , there have been very limited multi - wavelength studies of this sort .",
    "the main reason for this is probably that a given line of sight is rarely suitable for observations at more than one wavelength .",
    "for example , uv observations are generally made toward bright nearby stars which have no detectable radio emission .",
    "this rules out complimentary 21-cm studies along these lines of sight .",
    "although a direct comparison of the two temperatures along a given line of sight is difficult it is still possible to compare the average properties of the two temperatures measured from different surveys .",
    "for example , using a large sample of uv spectra towards nearby stars , @xcite found the mean value of t@xmath2 to be @xmath8  k , which is in good agreement with the mean value of the 21-cm t@xmath0 in cnm .",
    "this lends support to the argument that both these temperatures trace the kinetic temperature of the gas .",
    "the recent large scale high sensitivity and high angular resolution radio surveys like the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) however do allow a way around the problem of finding lines of sight suitable for both uv and radio observations by identifying radio sources that happen to be close to the line of sight to uv bright stars .",
    "these radio sources are generally too faint for the classical single dish emission absorption studies , but are well suited for interferometers where the subtraction of the smooth background emission is automatically achieved . in this work we present the results of the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) 21-cm h  i observations toward 18 radio sources .",
    "our sample ( drawn from the nvss catalog ) , consists of 18 radio sources brighter than 100 mjy . for each source",
    ", we require that there should be a star within @xmath9 , along the line of sight to which t@xmath2 is available in @xcite .",
    "our 18 radio sources correspond to 16 distinct stars , two stars having two corresponding radio sources .",
    "the details are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the columns in table  1 are : ( 1 )  the name of the optical source and ( 2 )  the radio source , ( 3 )  the distances to the star , ( 4 )  the stellar co - ordinates , ( 5 )  the co - ordinates of the corresponding radio source , ( 6 )  the total h@xmath1 column density from @xcite , ( 7 )  the line of sight extinction , @xmath10 from @xcite , ( 8)  the ortho - para temperature and its error bars ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* as well as from our recalculations from their data , see below ) , ( 9 )  the h  i 21-cm spin temperature ( see section  [ temp ] for details ) and ( 10 )  the fractional difference between t@xmath2 and t@xmath0 . it is clear from table  1 that lines of sight in our sample span wide range of @xmath10 and n(h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the transverse separations of the lines of sight of corresponding uv and radio observations at the distance of the stars ranges from 0.1 to 12.0 pc",
    ".    for the 6 sight lines with n(h@xmath1)@xmath11 @xmath5 , no error bars for the column densities were available in @xcite . for these cases",
    ", we obtained the column densities of h@xmath1 in j=0 , and j=1 rotational levels of ground vibrational level using voigt profile fitted to the _ copernicus _ archival data .",
    "our estimated column densities agree well with that reported by @xcite and we use our computed errors as indicative values while calculating the excitation temperatures for these systems .",
    "the gmrt radio observations were conducted between july 0710 2002 .",
    "for all sources the observing frequency was 1419.4 mhz and the total bandwidth was 2  mhz with 128 spectral channels ( i.e. a velocity resolution of @xmath12 km  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "the total on - source time was 34 hour on each source .",
    "scans on standard calibrators were used for flux calibration , phase calibration and also to determine the bandpass shape .",
    "data analysis was done using aips . after flagging out bad data",
    ", the flux density scale and instrumental phase were calibrated .",
    "the continuum emission was then subtracted from the multi - channel visibility data set using the task uvsub .",
    "any residual continuum was then subtracted in the image plane by fitting a linear baseline to line - free regions using imlin .",
    "for the 21-cm emission spectra we took data from the leiden - dwingeloo survey @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of this survey is @xmath14 , i.e. larger than the separation between our target star and the corresponding radio source .",
    "the spectral resolution of the raw data is 1.030 km s@xmath13 , however we hanning smoothed these spectra to match the resolution of absorption spectra .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    in panel ( d ) we plot @xmath15 t / t as a function of maximum separation between optical and radio sightlines .",
    "we do not find any clear trend in this plot .",
    "we explore this issue further by collating in table  2 the cases where we have more than 1 radio source or star within a separation of @xmath16 .",
    "the columns in the table are ( 1 )  the name of the sources , ( 2 )  position , ( 3 )  separation of the lines of sight ( ds ) at the distance of the star , ( 4 )  n(h  i ) and ( 5 )  the temperature ( t@xmath2 or t@xmath0 ) measured along the line of sight",
    ". we find , among the cases where t@xmath2 @xmath17 t@xmath0 , the match generally improves with decreasing separation , though there are cases ( e.g. hd36861 ) where the temperatures do not match even for a separation of 1.45  pc .",
    "one should note however that the separations are computed assuming the gas is at the distance of the star , while in reality the gas could lie anywhere between us and the star .",
    "in this work we present the gmrt measurement of 21-cm spin temperature toward 18 radio sources that are close to 16 bright starts for which uv observations are available .",
    "we find the t@xmath0 and t@xmath2 trace each other within the observational uncertainties when n(h@xmath1)@xmath18 @xmath5 in 75 per cent of the cases .",
    "t@xmath2 is found to be higher than t@xmath0 for the sightlines with low h@xmath1 column density .",
    "@xcite have performed similar analysis like us towards three directions .",
    "there is one star in our sample ( hd  22951 ) that is in common with @xcite . for this sightline",
    "t@xmath2 = 63@xmath1914 k and we find consistent t@xmath0 = 77@xmath192 toward a radio source with a maximum separation of 1.35 pc .",
    "@xcite report t@xmath2 = 27@xmath1913 and 29@xmath1911 k toward nrao 140 and 3c93.1 that are separated by 14.6 and 9.5 pc respectively from the star .",
    "the spin temperature that they quote is that for a single cnm component along the line of sight .",
    "if we instead use the column density weighted average of all cnm components in the velocity range probed by the c  i absorption @xcite , the spin temperatures are 53 and 72  k , i.e. in agreement with t@xmath2 .",
    "a major concern is that we do not know if our temperature comparisons are for the same gas ; we have only a plausible matching between the h  i and h@xmath1 absorbing gas . as discussed above though",
    ", this matching is likely to be on the average correct .",
    "if this is so , then our findings mean that t@xmath0 and t@xmath2 do not vary much over distances of a few parsecs .",
    "this is in apparent contrast to the well known findings that the h  i 21-cm opacity varies on much smaller spatial scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resolution may be that the opacity fluctuations reflect not so much fine scale structure in the temperature as fine scale structure in the velocity and density fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is also possible that our averaging over the several line of sight components decreases the effects of small scale variations .",
    "another issue is related to the relatively large error bars in t@xmath2 .",
    "is it possible that all that our data is telling us is that the cnm has a characteristic temperature @xmath20  k , and that the general agreement between t@xmath2 and t@xmath0 merely reflects the fact that both the uv and radio observations are probing the cnm ? or does the temperature agreement actually extend to individual lines of sight , as we have been asserting ?",
    "a least - square linear fit using all 11 lines of sight for which t@xmath2 and t@xmath0 agree ( including both the radio sources close to hd22928 and hd143275 ) for t@xmath2 @xmath21t@xmath0 gives r@xmath22 .",
    "for all the lines of sight with h@xmath1 column density higher than our threshold , the least - square fit gives r@xmath23 .",
    "as a quantitative check , we have calculated the spearman correlation coefficient for increasingly larger subsamples . for a subsample with all 11 lines of sight for which t@xmath0 matches t@xmath2 , the correlation coefficient is maximum ( 0.648 ) .",
    "the corresponding significance is @xmath24 ( from a two - tailed test ) . for a subsample with all 14 lines of sight",
    "for which h@xmath1 column density is more than 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , the correlation coefficient is 0.545 . on the other hand when one includes lines of sight with n(h@xmath1 ) less than 10@xmath25 @xmath5",
    ", the correlation coefficient goes down to 0.406 ( for our complete sample ) . to summarize then , as per the spearman rank coefficient test , at the better than 95% level",
    ", there is a one to one relation between t@xmath2 and t@xmath0 for the 11 lines of sight with n(h@xmath1 ) higher than @xmath26 @xmath5 .",
    "agreement between t@xmath0 and t@xmath2 for high column density gas would mean that the ortho - para equilibrium is mainly due to exchange collisions and that t@xmath27 does not reflect the formation temperature .",
    "the absence of relation between the two temperatures when n(h@xmath1 ) is optically thin is consistent with the slow rate of exchange collisions compared to the h@xmath1 destruction rate and excess solomon pumping from j=0 and j=1 levels that make t@xmath2 deviate from the kinetic temperature and hence t@xmath0 .",
    "the observations presented in this paper were obtained using the gmrt which is operated by the national centre for radio astrophysics ( ncra ) of the tata institute of fundamental research ( tifr ) , india .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for prompting us into substantially improving this paper .",
