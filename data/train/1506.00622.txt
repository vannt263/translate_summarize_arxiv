    "since the introduction of one compact extra dimension in general relativity by kaluza and klein in the @xmath4 s , the interest in this subject has oscillated during the last century @xcite . the attention to the use of compact extra dimensions changed in the late @xmath5 s when membranes were proposed in the string theory context as a contour condition for open strings@xcite .",
    "the main result of these studies is the conception of a high dimensional space with extra dimensions where the four dimensional world being a surface . in this direction , at the beginning of this century , randall and sundrum ( rs ) proposed two models with warped geometry in ads space and delta - like branes @xcite .",
    "the so called type i model is compact with @xmath6 symmetry and was posed to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "the type ii is an alternative to compactification , with a large extra dimension .",
    "the addition of large extra dimensions brings a new problem : the confinement of the fields in the membrane .",
    "if the fields are not confined and able to scape to the extra dimensions this would be observed in the four dimensional world . in these models the confinement of the fields are treated in a very different way than in kk compactification , since the fields can not be expanded in discrete modes .",
    "however , one can make a standard separation of variables , in the five dimensional field equations , and obtain an one dimensional schrdinger - like equation where the eigenvalues are the mass of the field under consideration . since the free action is quadratic in the fields , the confinement is related to the square integrability of the solution to the schrdinger - like equation .",
    "the zero mode of the gravity field was shown to be localized by rs , providing a consistent massless theory of gravity in four dimensions .",
    "however , it was shown in the original paper that the zero mode of the gauge field is not localized due to its conformal invariance . as a consequence",
    "this became a drawback of the type ii model .",
    "for non - abelian gauge fields the problem is even worse . for this case",
    "there are cubic and quartic terms , and if one uses a standard gauge invariant theory in the bulk , the gauge invariance will be lost in four dimensions during the process of dimensional reduction since for the zero mode @xmath7 .    no matter the zero modes are localized or not , resonances can be seen over the membrane as possible unstable massive modes .",
    "this has been considered in a seminal paper in the same year of the original rs paper @xcite , and was done by the construction of a smooth version of the model to treat the singularity .",
    "after this , other smooth versions have been considered such as topological defects and kinks @xcite and resonances has been computed . on this subject ,",
    "a series of papers proposed a tool , commonly used in condensed matter , to analyze resonances : the transfer matrix method @xcite . with this tool",
    "a rich structure of resonances has been observed very clearly @xcite . despite the complicated form of the effective potential in smooth versions , analytical solutions has been found @xcite , and it was soon generalized @xcite . with this solution",
    "the transfer matrix method was tested and show to agree with the analytical results .    using a different approach ,",
    "many models has been proposed to solve the problem of zero mode localization of the @xmath8 gauge field .",
    "most of them use new degrees of freedom , and although consistent , this seems unnatural @xcite . in the search for models without new degrees of freedom , oda proposed that a topologically massive gauge field could solve the problem of zero mode localization @xcite .",
    "however , a massive gauge field is obtained over the membrane . following this , recently ghoroku _",
    "et al_. proposed the addition of two terms to the action : a standard mass term and a boundary mass term @xcite . by tuning the parameters ,",
    "a localized zero mode is obtained .",
    "recently , this model was generalized to include @xmath9 form fields and resonances was computed by the present authors @xcite . in all this models , although the five dimensional gauge invariance is lost in five dimension , it is recovered for the zero mode in four dimensions .",
    "but , soon it became clear that this mechanism does not work for non - abelian gauge fields and batell _ et al_. has shown that a boundary coupling to the field strength is also necessary @xcite .    although the ghoroku _",
    "et al_. and batell _ et al_. models provided the localization of the zero mode for gauge fields , it was not clear what was the origin of such couplings .",
    "the origin of these couplings were recently proposed @xcite , where the first was obtained by coupling the mass term with the ricci scalar . both of the ghoroku _",
    "et al_. model terms can be naturally generated when delta like membranes were considered .",
    "more than just generating the right couplings , it was discovered that the model also provided a simple analytical solution for the zero mode of the schrdinger - like equation .",
    "such analytical solution has the property of being valid for any conformal metric , being therefore valid for both , type i and ii rs scenarios .",
    "the interesting fact about this solution is that no degree of freedom was added , providing a more natural extension of the original rs model . because of this , the mechanism has been called `` geometrical localization '' . interestingly",
    ", the same mechanism was proven to work for @xmath9forms and elko spinors @xcite . moreover , by tuning the value of the couplings , analytical solutions were also found to these cases and localization of the zero mode was reached . with this generalization",
    ", a consistent vector field can be obtained from the dimensional reduction of the two - form field in five dimensions .",
    "apparently the addition of a non - minimal coupling with gravity seems to bring a bunch of interesting new results to the rs scenario .",
    "for example , in a recent paper the present authors realized a detailed study of resonances and obtained another very curious numerical result : geometrical localization do not generate resonances for the @xmath9forms @xcite .",
    "this is very curious since this is not the common behavior in theses scenarios .    when considering non - abelian fields the localization problem is not solved by coupling the mass term with the ricci scalar .",
    "for completeness of the geometrical localization model , it should be possible to find a geometrical origin of the batell _",
    "et al_. model , which couples the field strength with the boundary .",
    "in fact , the gravity origin of this coupling has been proposed recently in @xcite based on a non - minimal generalization of the gauge field proposed some time ago by horndeski @xcite .",
    "however , the model does not provide the localization of the zero mode . to solve this , a recent paper proposed a model which introduces the horndeski coupling plus the coupling with the mass term @xcite . with this",
    "we get a model that reduces to the batell _",
    "et al_. model when a delta like brane is considered .",
    "just as before , this model also provides analytical solutions , for arbitrary warp factor , to the zero mode of the schrdinger - like . in this way",
    ", the problem of zero mode localization of @xmath10 gauge fields is solved , providing a consistent gauge invariant theory in four dimensions for type i and ii rs models .",
    "an important point to be considered is that if the model is valid beyond first approximation .",
    "if we consider the full theory the coupling with ricci scalar will be a function of the brane coordinates and this would spoil gauge invariance . in a recent manuscript @xcite we showed that when we consider the full theory in fact gauge invariance is broken throughout an effective mass term .",
    "since the ricci scalar is coupled to the square of the gauge field , we will have a term proportional to @xmath11 over the brane",
    ". therefore the effective mass is given by @xmath12 .",
    "using einstein equation we know that @xmath13 . where @xmath14 is the density of energy and @xmath15 is the cosmological constant .",
    "this is very small and far below the present experimental upper bounds of the photon mass , @xmath16 .",
    "for example ,",
    "for the solar wind magnetic field @xmath17 t , which yields the lower present experimental constraint ( @xmath18 ) @xcite , we find that the photon mass is @xmath19 kg , considering the solar magnetosphere as a perfect fluid in the minkowskyan vacuum .",
    "this guarantees the validity of the model . despite the fact that we have not carefully analyzed the non - abelian case we can estimate the consistence with experimental bounds . in our recently published paper @xcite ,",
    "we have estimated the photon mass in the environment of a neutron star core as being   @xmath20 kg .",
    "however , we may think that such a mass is more appropriated related to the gluon one , since in that medium prevails this particle as well as quarks ( e.g. , quark - gluon plasma ) .",
    "we can compare this with the upper bounds for the gluon mass obtained in the literature , which go from @xmath21 to @xmath22 kg @xcite .",
    "therefore , the estimation based on our model satisfactorily suits to these limits .    in this manuscript",
    "we put forward the effort to understand the structure of geometrical localization .",
    "for this we generalize the previous coupling of the mass term with the ricci scalar @xcite .",
    "this is done by considering all the geometrical tensors which can be coupled with a mass - like term .",
    "since this term is quadratic and symmetric one must consider tensors with two symmetric indices .",
    "the possibilities are the ricci tensor @xmath23 and the einstein tensor @xmath24 . with this , the localizability of the zero mode of the gauge and of the reduced scalar fields can be studied .",
    "a detailed study of the massive modes by computing the resonances using the transfer matrix method is also performed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the second section presents a short review of the geometrical localization mechanism with the ricci scalar and how the transversal and longitudinal components of the gauge fields can be decoupled to obtain the schrdinger - like equation . in the third section",
    "all the needed geometrical objects used in the manuscript will be computed explicitly .",
    "the fourth section considers the coupling of the ricci tensor with the mass term and solve the mass equation analytically for the zero mode . in the fifth section we study the resonances for this coupling , considering three types of warp factors . in the sixth and seventh sections",
    "perform the same steps to the coupling with the einstein tensor . finally in the eighth section we present the conclusion and perspectives .",
    "in this section a short review of the geometrical localization mechanism is presented @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been achieved by considering the addition of a coupling between a mass term of a vector field and the ricci scalar .",
    "therefore , in five dimensions the gauge invariance is lost .",
    "this also breaks the conformal symmetry of the gauge field .",
    "however , it has been shown that a massless , gauge invariant , zero mode of the vector field can be obtained over the membrane .",
    "below we describe how this can be reached .",
    "the action is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the vector field , @xmath27 , the metric @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the ricci scalar .",
    "the equations of motion are therefore @xmath31    the task now is to show that the above equations will provide a localized zero mode . for this",
    "we must show that the transversal and longitudinal components of the vector field are decoupled .",
    "first of all , from the antisymmetry of eq .",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) we obtain the divergenceless condition @xmath32 . then split the field in two parts @xmath33 , where @xmath34 stands for longitudinal and @xmath35 stands for transversal with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . with this and",
    "@xmath38 we can show the following identities @xmath39 where @xmath40 , the prime means a @xmath41 derivative and all lower dimensional indexes will be contracted with @xmath42 , and the divergenceless condition can be written as @xmath43 this is an equation relating the scalar field and the longitudinal component of the vector field being crucial for the modes decoupling . now",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) can be divided in two . for @xmath44 @xmath45 and for @xmath46",
    "we get @xmath47    using now eqs .",

    "( [ m=00003dmu ] ) the equation for the transverse part of the gauge field @xmath49    now by separating the @xmath41 dependence like @xmath50 , using @xmath51 and performing the transformation @xmath52 we get the desired schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath53 which is localized for @xmath54 with solution @xmath55 . for the scalar field",
    "we must be careful since we have @xmath56    performing the separation of variables @xmath57 , defining @xmath58 , and using eq .",
    "( [ transverserelation ] ) we get a schrdinger equation for the massive mode of the scalar field with a potential given by @xcite @xmath59 with this potential we see that the zero mode of the scalar field solution is localized for @xmath60 .",
    "this shows us that we can not have both fields localized .",
    "when considering the reduced scalar field an equation will appear throughout the manuscript , therefore lets manipulate it in the general form @xmath61 or @xmath62    if we compare with the identity found in @xcite we get @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . with this",
    "we obtain @xmath66 with @xmath67 and the potential @xmath68 with our definition we see that @xmath69 and the final form of the potential is @xmath70    before considering the generalization to other couplings , in the next section we must yet review and obtain the necessary geometrical objects to be used in the manuscript .",
    "due to the variety of geometrical objects needed in this manuscript we use this section to obtain them .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath71 from where @xmath72 and the components of the curvature tensor are @xmath73 leading to the ricci tensor and scalar @xmath74    the other tensor that will be used in this manuscript is the einstein tensor that now can be easily obtained @xmath75    in subsequent sections we will consider warp factors which asymptotically recovers the rs metric , namely @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , we also give here explicitly all the geometrical quantities for this case .",
    "first we should note that @xmath77 and we get , by using the fact that @xmath78 , @xmath79 from the above we get @xmath80 and @xmath81    due to the simplicity of the expressions ( [ rmnrgeral ] ) and ( [ gmngeneral ] ) we can yet simplify it relating to trace expressions by @xmath82 and @xmath83    where we have used a bar to indicate that an index has been raised with @xmath84 , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86    the relation between objects with and without bar is given by @xmath87 . in the next section",

    "in this and in the next section we are going to use subscripts in order to avoid confusion . with this",
    "we get the equations of motion @xmath90 and from the antisymmetry of @xmath91 we get the divergence condition @xmath92 since the gauge freedom is lost , one must be careful in dealing with the above equations .",

    "( [ potp-1 g ] ) . because the components of the einstein tensor , eqs . ( [ gbdw ] ) and ( [ g5dw ] ) , vanishes at regular points near to the origin for all values of parameter @xmath156 , the potential diverges at these points .",
    "these kind of divergence does not allow us to use the transfer matrix method to compute the transmission coefficient and to evaluate the existence of unstable massive modes .",
    "finally we compute the transmission coefficient in another smooth brane scenario , one generated by a kink @xcite .",
    "the warp factor is given by @xmath157 where the variable @xmath158 relates with the conformal coordinate , @xmath41 , by @xmath159 the behavior of the potential of the transversal part of @xmath131-form field , eq .",
    "( [ potpg ] ) , with the above warp factor was illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : potrmn - kink ] . for massive modes , like in previous sections , we use the transfer matrix method to compute the transmission coefficient .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : trmn - kink ] , and exhibits a smooth behavior , indicating the non existence of unstable massive modes . as showed in detail the increases of probability near to @xmath189 is not a resonance peak .    for the scalar field , like the previous case",
    ", the components of einstein tensor vanishes at regular points , making the potential divergent at this same points .",
    "these kind of divergence does not allow us to use the transfer matrix method to compute the transmission coefficient and to evaluate the existence of unstable massive modes .",
    "in this paper we have generalized the geometrical localization mechanism .",
    "the strongest point of the model is that it solves the problem of gauge field localization without the addition of new degrees of freedom .",
    "the generalization was made by considering other kinds of couplings to the mass term of a vector field .",
    "since the mass term is quadratic and symmetric , we must consider only tensors with two symmetric indices .",
    "the possibilities are the ricci and the einstein tensors .",
    "since the mass term breaks gauge invariance we must show that it is recovered for the zero mode .",
    "for this we first split the vector field in its transversal and longitudinal components . for both couplings",
    "we then show that the components are decoupled in the equations of motion .",
    "this provides a consistent four dimensional , gauge invariant , equation of motion for the zero mode of the vector field .",
    "after this we analyzed the localizability of this zero mode .",
    "this is important for both rs models , providing a consistent way of obtaining a four dimensional , gauge invariant action , from a bulk action .",
    "we discovered that the ricci tensor provides us with a localized zero mode if we fix the coupling constant to @xmath190 .",
    "since the result is valid for any range in the integration and for any warp factor it is valid for rs i and ii . for the einstein tensor we showed that the solution is not localized .",
    "another important point of the paper is the discussion about the kind of couplings that can generate localization .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 and @xmath24 do not generate localized zero modes is at least curious .",
    "both have a null divergence .",
    "however , @xmath161 and @xmath23 generate a localized zero mode and these tensors do not have a null divergence .",
    "the above results points to the fact that tensors with null divergence can not generate localized zero modes for the gauge field .",
    "perhaps this is pointing to some yet unseen fundamental property of this kind of coupling .",
    "until a prove of this is found in general , it must be tested case by case .    despite the fact that the zero modes are localized , unstable massive modes can be seen over the membrane . for this analysis",
    "we have computed the transmission coefficient using the transfer matrix in order to find resonance peaks indicating the existence of these modes .",
    "we considered three different brane scenarios : delta - like , kink - like and domain - wall - like .",
    "the first case considered was the coupling with the ricci tensor . in rs , or delta - like , brane scenario",
    "the analytical solution of the schrdinger equation for massive modes shows that the transmission coefficient does not exhibits resonance peaks .",
    "also in this brane model we showed that the scalar field has no unstable massive modes on the brane , i.e , the transmission coefficient does not exhibits resonance peaks .    next the smooth scenarios were considered . in booth scenarios",
    "the schrdinger equation can not be solved analytically and we used the transfer matrix method to compute the transmission coefficient .",
    "the results indicated that no unstable massive modes of vector field can be found on the brane .",
    "also in smooth branes the computational method could no be applied to compute the transmission coefficient of scalar field .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ricci tensor vanish at regular points in booth smooth scenarios , making the potential divergent at these points .",
    "finally , the massive modes for the coupling with the einstein tensor were considered .",
    "we have shown that this coupling does not localize the massive and the zero modes of vector field .",
    "anyway we searched for unstable massive modes by computing the transmission coefficient . since the zero mode is non - localized , the coupling constant is not fixed , like in the ricci tensor case .",
    "this freedom allowed us to compute the transmission coefficient for some values of the coupling constant .",
    "like in previous cases , in rs scenario the transmission coefficient could be computed analytically for the vector field and for scalar field .",
    "booth coefficients does not exhibits resonances peaks , i.e. , no unstable modes of these fields can be found on the brane for all parameters used . as before , we considered the smooth brane cases . despite the presence of a most probable states for @xmath191",
    ", the result indicated that no resonance peaks appears for all parameters used in the numeric calculation .",
    "like in ricci tensor coupling case , the potential for scalar field diverges at regular points , making impossible the use of the transfer matrix method to compute the transmission coefficient in booth smooth cases . with all the above calculations",
    "got to the conclusion that geometrical couplings do not generate resonances . in a previous study",
    "some of us has considered the resonances for the ricci scalar case where this same pattern has been found .",
    "we should point that , just as in the analysis of the zero mode , until some general proof of this pattern is found , it must be tested case by case .",
