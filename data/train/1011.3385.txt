    "tracing the molecular gas content is an essential part of studying star formation in galaxies . molecular hydrogen , however , can not be observed directly except in hot and/or shocked environments because of its lack of dipole moments .",
    "consequently , co lines have been used via the `` co - to-@xmath0 conversion factor ( @xmath1 ) '' to calibrate the molecular gas quantity .",
    "measurements of @xmath1 are conducted mainly by comparing the dynamical mass and the co luminosity of a molecular cloud , and is known to be constant ( but with considerable scatter ) in the milky way at around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 in other environments is controversial , however .",
    "in particular , the study of @xmath1 and its dependence on metallicity in low metallicity environments have met severe difficulties . while @xcite and @xcite find an increasing @xmath1 with decreasing metallicity , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others find a constant value of @xmath1 within a range of metallicities .",
    "it is important to note , however , that previous studies which find a constant conversion factor are based on co observations at relatively high metallicities , i.e. , higher than @xmath3 \\sim 8.0 $ ] . in order to gain decisive information on the metallicity dependence of @xmath1 , observations at low metallicities",
    "is necessary .",
    "this has been a difficult task , however , because co has failed to be detected in galaxies with metallicity lower than @xmath3 \\sim 8.0 $ ] @xcite . the lowest metallicity galaxy with detected co is izw  36 , at @xmath3 \\sim 7.9 $ ] @xcite which is only tentative .",
    "attempts to detect co in low metallicity systems @xcite may have failed for two reasons ; 1 ) co fails to be a good tracer of molecular gas at such metallicities ( i.e. , a high conversion factor ) , or 2 ) molecular gas is actually less abundant in such galaxies . while the first explanation is supported from theoretical views @xcite ,",
    "the second explanation is less convincing , since star formation is still found in low metallicity dwarfs , and star formation requires gas at high densities .    in either case",
    ", calibrating @xmath1 requires an actual detection of co in these low metallicity systems .",
    "we have conducted a deep search for @xmath4 in the low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy ddo  154 , a member of the local group .",

    "the metallicity of @xmath6 = 7.67$](@xcite , @xcite ; ks01 ) , which is about 1/20 of our galaxy , places ddo154 as one of the most metal - deficient galaxies . basic properties of ddo  154 are presented in table [ ddo154prop ] .",
    "ddo154 is unique in that dark matter constitutes 90% of its dynamical mass , therefore giving it the name `` dark galaxy '' @xcite .",
    "stars account for only 2% of the dynamical mass , with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xcite , placing ddo154 one of the most gas rich galaxies known .",

    "sixteen hii regions were identified in ks01 , and the ratio of the present star formation rate to average past star formation rate ( birthrate parameter @xmath10 ) was found to be @xmath11 to @xmath12 , showing a quiescent phase .",
    "the gas consumption time is found to be over 200 gyr @xcite .",

    ", increasing the star formation efficiency @xmath50 to 1 is not sufficient .",

    "the schmidt - kennicutt law estimation of molecular gas implicitly derives the total molecular gas surface density within the unresolved region , including diffuse molecular gas that is not directly associated with region 2 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 estimation given here may still be biased towards a higher value as pointed out in @xcite . in order to mitigate such biases ,",
    "we have stressed the selection of conservative values whenever possible . the consistent lower limit on @xmath1 given from molecular gas estimation based on a individual molecular gas argument in equation ( 4 ) , may justify the use of such methods using an empirical star formation law .",
    "nevertheless , figure 4 alone should not be taken as an indication on @xmath1 at low metallicities , but as a representation of how co is undetectable at such metallicities , and the depth of the co observation given here .",
    "we have obtained sensitive spectra in search of co in ddo154 , a low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxy . in particular , the targeted hii region ( region 2 ) is expected to contain a detectable amount of molecular gas , if a galactic conversion factor is applicable in such low metallicity environments . using two large aperture single dish telescopes , however , we did not detect any significant co emission in region 2 .",
    "the obtained upper limit on the co intensity is one of the lowest in a low metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "we calculate the expected molecular column density from two views , one based on the schmidt - kennicutt law extrapolated to low densities , and another based on a local argument of a collapsing molecular cloud .",
    "both estimations gave similar values . applying a method used previously ( e.g. , @xcite ) and using conservative values in all assumptions , we derive a lower limit on the co - to-@xmath0 conversion factor which is at least 10 times higher than in the milky way .",
    "our results strongly support a an increasing conversion factor with decreasing metallicity , but inconsistent with a constant ( galactic ) conversion factor , unless the molecular cloud forms stars very efficiently ( all of the gas converted to stars ) at a timescale significantly shorter than @xmath60 years .",
