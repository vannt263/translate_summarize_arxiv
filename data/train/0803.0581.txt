    "we first show the effect of chiral symmetry restoration on the quark potential in hot and dense medium . with the parameter values in the model and in the pauli - villars regularization scheme , shown in the last section , the pole mass @xmath65 and width @xmath66 as functions of temperature at zero chemical potential are presented in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath86 . in chiral limit ,",

    "pions are bound states with zero width , but sigma mass is slightly larger than two times the quark mass .",

    "the meson masses get saturated when the temperature is high enough , this will lead to the saturation of the quark potential , see the following discussion .",
    "note that , the finite width plays a crucial rule in the chiral restoration phase . at @xmath89 , quarks become almost massless , and pions and sigma satisfy the decay condition @xmath94 . if the meson width is neglected , the pole is located on the imaginary axis and goes into the vacuum cut , and the pole contribution will be fully suppressed .",
    "however , for a nonzero width , even if it is very small compared with the mass , the pole position deviates from the imaginary axis , it is outside the vacuum cut and its contribution is not removed from the quark potential .",

    ", we keep the quark mass and pion mass as their values in the vacuum and remain only the explicit temperature dependence in the distribution function @xmath97 . in this case , the quark potential becomes stronger in comparison with the vacuum potential , because of the increasing quark density in hot medium , and is significantly different from the calculation with chiral symmetry restoration where the potential is much weaker than the vacuum potential , due to the change in the chiral dynamics .",
    "since sigma is much heavier than pion in the phase with chiral symmetry breaking , and they become degenerate when the symmetry is restored , sigma exchange is remarkably reflected in the quark potential only in the short range for @xmath76 and becomes equivalently important as pion exchange for @xmath89 .",

    "the former is due to the sharp fermi surface and the latter arises from complex poles of meson exchanges . from the matter and pole contributions ( [ vm ] ) and ( [ vp ] ) , there are always oscillations in the two parts . to know whether they can be clearly reflected in the total potential ,",
    "we separately show the three contributions from the vacuum cut , matter cut and pole in fig.[fig5 ] . while there is a remarkable oscillation around @xmath101 fm in the matter part at @xmath96 and @xmath95 , see the upper panel , it can not be seen clearly in the total potential , since at high temperature and low density the matter contribution is not the dominant one in the total potential . in this case , only yukawa oscillation can be seen , if the width is large enough . at @xmath95",
    "the pion width is too small and the induced weak oscillation is difficult to be demonstrated in the total potential . on the other hand , at low temperature and high density ,",
    "the quark potential is absolutely controlled by the matter cut , see the lower panel at @xmath100 with @xmath102 mev being the critical chemical potential for @xmath99 mev , and only the fermi - surface induced friedel oscillation can be seen in the total potential .",
    "when the temperature and chemical potential are not low enough , especially in the chiral restoration phase , the contribution from the vacuum cut is always smaller than the matter part and pole part .",
    "the friedel oscillation is related to the singularity of the matter part of the meson polarization function @xmath103 at @xmath104 on the real axis at zero temperature , where @xmath105 is the quark fermi momentum , see ( [ meson4 ] ) . at finite temperature , there is no more strict fermi surface and singularity in the polarization function , the oscillation will become weak at low temperature and finally disappear at high enough temperature . in the upper panel of fig.[fig6 ]",
    "we plot the quark potential at fixed chemical potential for three values of temperature .",
    "the friedel oscillation is gradually washed away by increasing temperature .",
    "the chemical potential dependence of the friedel oscillation at fixed temperature is shown in the lower panel . in the chiral breaking phase with low chemical potential @xmath106",
    ", there is no fermi momentum and in turn no friedel oscillation .",
    "the oscillation happens only in the chiral restoration phase , and the amplitude and frequency increase with increasing chemical potential .",
    "the strength of the yukawa oscillation depends strongly on the pole width . in fig.[fig7 ] we show the pion - mediated quark potential in the chiral restoration phase with @xmath96 and @xmath107 for three different values of width .",
    "as we emphasized above , the potential at high temperature and low density is dominated by the pole contribution . from the analytic structure of the meson polarization function ( [ meson4 ] ) ,",
    "its matter part is continuous on the imaginary axis , and only the vacuum part contributes to the width ( [ width ] ) . from our numerical calculation ,",
    "see fig.[fig2 ] , the width is only about @xmath92 of the mass at @xmath107 , and therefore the yukawa oscillation can not be clearly shown in fig.[fig7 ] . however , this small width can not be neglected , otherwise the pole will be located on the imaginary axis and go into the vacuum cut , and has no contribution to the potential . to see a clear yukawa oscillation ,",
    "we take artificially the width as a free parameter and calculate the potential with @xmath108 . in this case",
    ", there is really a strong oscillation around @xmath101 fm , as we expected .    from the analysis of the experimental data obtained in relativistic heavy ion collisions , especially the anisotropic flow , and the lattice and model calculation on the resonant states of quarks and gluons above the critical temperature",
    ", it is widely accepted that the parton system above and close to the critical temperature is a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the temperature region is about @xmath109  @xcite . above this region , quarks and gluons",
    "are weakly coupled and the system can approximately be considered as an ideal gas . in fig.[fig8 ] we show the temperature dependence of the pion - mediated quark potential at zero chemical potential . with increasing temperature , the potential becomes weaker and weaker due to the chiral symmetry restoration , and finally gets saturated for @xmath110 .",
    "since the used pauli - villars regularization scheme guarantees the ideal gas limit at @xmath111  @xcite , we can conclude from this saturation that , the quark - meson plasma is strongly coupled in the temperature region @xmath112 . above @xmath113 , the system behaves like an ideal gas . while there are no gluons and confinement in the njl model",
    ", the quark - meson plasma has the similar strong coupling region as the quark - gluon plasma .    .",
    ", width=302 ]    to describe the degree of particle coupling in matter , one can introduce the ratio of particle potential to particle kinetic energy  @xcite , @xmath114 a large ratio means a strongly coupled matter and a small ratio indicates a weakly coupled matter . for the considered quark - meson plasma , we take the potential @xmath115 as the meson - mediated quark potential at the average distance between two quarks , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the summation of @xmath118 over all possible meson exchanges , the averaged quark radius @xmath119 is determined by the quark and anti - quark number densities @xmath120 and @xmath121 , @xmath122 with @xmath123 , and the quark kinetic energy is @xmath124 the ratio is shown in fig.[fig9 ] as a function of chemical potential at fixed temperature @xmath99 mev .",
    "different from the kinetic energy @xmath125 which monotonously goes up with increasing temperature or chemical potential , the potential @xmath115 depends on both the shape of the potential and the quark density .",
    "the former is controlled by chiral dynamics and the latter is determined by thermodynamics . with increasing temperature or chemical potential , the quark potential becomes weak , while the density increases and in turn the radius @xmath119 gets small . from our numerical calculation ,",
    "the ratio is rather small at low and high chemical potentials , but peaks strongly at the critical point .",
    "this tells us that the strongest coupling in the quark - meson plasma is located at the chiral phase transition .",
    "the smoothly increasing ratio after the phase transition is due to the strong friedel oscillation at high density . from the ads",
    "/ cft estimation  @xcite and perturbative qcd calculation  @xcite , it is well - known that the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy @xmath126 has the minimum value at the critical point of any phase transition , which is widely considered as a general property of strongly coupled matter .",
    "the maximum of the ratio @xmath127 at the chiral phase transition agrees well with the minimum of the ratio @xmath126 , both describe the strongest coupling at the phase transition .",
    "the peak is located at the critical point of chiral symmetry restoration.,width=302 ]",
    "in the frame of the two flavor su(2 ) njl model , we calculated the light quark potential through pion and sigma exchanges in rpa approximation .",
    "the chiral symmetry restoration at high temperature and density plays an essential rule in the quark potential .",
    "while the matter part is always associated with an oscillation , it dominates the potential only for dense matter , and therefore the oscillation can be reflected clearly in the total quark potential only at low temperate and high density .",
    "the other possible oscillation in the chiral restoration phase is the yukawa oscillation induced by the complex poles of mesons . from our self - consistent calculation for meson mass and width , the yukawa oscillation is weak even at extremely high temperature .",
    "the potential gets saturated when temperature is larger than about three times the critical temperature .",
    "this means that the strongly coupled quark - meson plasma is in the region of @xmath128 , which agrees well with the widely accepted result for the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "corresponding to the well - known minimum of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy , we found that the ratio of potential to kinetic energy peaks strongly at the critical point of chiral phase transition .    while we found the strong coupling region for the quark - meson plasma through considering the saturation of quark potential , the saturation temperature @xmath90 looks beyond the effective range of the njl model",
    "the reliable conclusion is probably that the quark - meson plasma above and close to the chiral critical point is strongly coupled . in our calculation",
    "we did not include the vector meson exchange which is expected to contribute a repulsive part to the quark potential and then reduce the depth of the potential well in the short range . to have a complete calculation of the quark potential in the njl model , one should consider the vector mesons .",
    "another point is the deconfinement effect , it will be helpful to investigate the quark potential using the improved njl model with polyakov loop dynamics  @xcite .",
    "since the original njl model with pions and sigma describes well the chiral dynamics in the vacuum and at finite temperature and density , we hope our result on the quark potential in the quark - meson plasma is helpful to understand the effect of chiral symmetry restoration on the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
