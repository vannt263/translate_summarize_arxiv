    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario for structure formation have been widely accepted in our universe , and wmap results ( @xcite ) also strengthened this scenario .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations for structure formation based on cdm scenario nicely reproduce observed , large scale structures such as cluster of galaxies .",
    "however , as recently mentioned by @xcite and @xcite , the scenario meets crisis in small scale structures . in their high resolution , cosmological n - body simulation based on cdm scenario , there are too many `` subhalos ( or substructures ) '' around galactic scale objects compared with actually observed substructures around milky way .",
    "if cdm scenario for structure formation is correct , many substructures should be invisible or not detectable due to very low star formation efficiency by some feedback processes ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite or @xcite ) at least in current observational instruments .",
    "however , how can we confirm or reject the existence of theoretically predicted , many number of substructures around galaxies ?",
    "the best probe can be gravitational lensing , since not brightness or luminosity of objects but only mass or density profile of objects is essential to this phenomenon .",
    "thus , we may be able to probe invisible substructures around galaxies by utilizing gravitational lensing .",
    "recently , @xcite extends arguments of @xcite and presents a nice idea .",
    "he focused on magnification anomalies in multiple images of two gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "such anomalies can not be explained by smooth single lens model for lens galaxies and he proposed that the possible explanation for such flux anomalies is the existence of substructures around lens galaxies . following this work , @xcite investigate satellite mass fraction for seven gravitationally lensed quasars via monte carlo simulations , and they find that the resultant satellite mass fraction , @xmath3 agree with predictions of cosmological n - body simulation based on cdm scenario ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) . furthermore , @xcite and @xcite mentioned that milliarcsecond scale bending of radio jets in gravitationally lensed quasar is due to the distortion by gravitational lens effect of substructures around the lens galaxy .",
    "these works seem to find a way to save cdm scenario for structure formation from its crisis , but there still remains some ambiguity .",
    "first of all , flux magnification due to gravitational lens effect does not directly reflect mass of the lens , and magnification anomalies may not be direct evidence for substructures around lens galaxies .",
    "for example , as is well known in gravitationally lensed quasar with quadruple image , q2237 + 0305 ( huchra s lens or einstein cross ) , gravitationally lensed quasars may suffer quasar microlensing by stellar mass objects in the lens galaxy ( @xcite , see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for quasar microlensing in another system ) .",
    "thus , magnification anomalies due to quasar microlensing can be occurring in most of gravitationally lensed quasars .",
    "however , the time scales for such phenomena in most systems are quite long compared with q2237 + 0305 , say several years , due to long distance to the lens galaxy , and it is difficult to discriminate magnification anomalies due to substructures around galaxies and that due to quasar microlensing only a few photometric observation .",
    "secondly , image distortion of radio jets seems to stronger evidence for substructures around galaxies , but it can still not be direct evidence for such structures .",
    "the reason is the structure of radio jets is generally complicated and it may not easy task to find distortion between radio jets in corresponding images .",
    "of course , different from magnification , image distortion can be an indicator for typical scale of gravitational lens , e.g. , einstein ring radius , and also for mass of the lens .",
    "however , the proposed idea is based on weak lensing regime , and it is not clear that the scale of distortion directly reflects the scale of gravitational lens , and there still remains some ambiguity , too .    in this paper , we investigate new important aspects of gravitational lensing to obtain more direct evidence for substructure around galaxies than previously proposed ideas . here , we focus on strong lensing regime of gravitational lens effects by substructures . in this regime ,",
    "further multiple images in one of multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars are expected .",
    "this interesting phenomenon has never been discussed before , and we estimate expected values for the image separation and the time delay between such further multiple images . reflecting mass of the lens objects , the values should be smaller than those for macrolensing due to galactic scale lens , but larger than those for microlensing due to stellar scale lens , and this gravitational lens effect can be called `` quasar mesolensing '' . different from magnification anomaly ,",
    "image separation and time delay between further multiple images induced by quasar mesolensing directly reflect mass of the lens objects via typical lens size such as einstein ring radius for point mass lens , and these signals can be stronger evidences for the existence of substructures than magnification anomaly . in next section , we show that gravitationally lensed quasars are the most suitable targets to probe substructures around galaxies from simple argument . in section 3 , lens models and numerical method are investigated , and the results of our calculations are presented in section 4 .",
    "expected values for actual observations are presented in section 5 , and final section is devoted to discussions .",
    "in previous works , the detectability of substructure around galaxies are only considered in the case of gravitationally lensed quasars . here , we go back to the first step and briefly discuss about the most suitable system to probe substructure around galaxies .",
    "luminosity or surface brightness of substructures should be quite faint and unknown , and we investigate the method to probe substructures as not the source but the lens . in the following argument , we fix total number of substructures ( @xmath4 ) , mass of individual substructures ( @xmath5 ) , and the size of host galaxies of substructures ( @xmath6 ) in all galaxies , for simplicity .",
    "if we take into account more realistic situations , the following argument for our current purpose will not dramatically change .    the most essential quantity to estimate",
    "the detectability of gravitational lens effect is the optical depth for gravitational lensing , @xmath7 .",
    "this value is identical to the surface mass density of lens objects in the unit of critical surface mass density or the coverage fraction by the typical size of gravitational lens on the sky . if we put the host galaxy at the angular diameter distance @xmath8",
    ", substructures will exist roughly in the region with @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , we consider the lens objects as the point mass and the typical lens size is evaluated by einstein ring radius ( @xmath10 ) which is expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the angular diameter distance between the lens and the source and the observer to the source , respectively . by using this typical lens size , the total coverage by substructure lenses on the sky is @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the optical depth ( @xmath7 ) is evaluated as follows , @xmath15    the equation means that the distant lens system has larger optical depth for gravitational lensing except some special case such as self - lensing , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "for example , the gpc - scale lens systems have three orders of magnitude larger optical depth than the mpc - scale lens systems .",
    "therefore , distant galaxies are more preferable to our purpose rather than the milky way galaxy , and gravitationally lensed quasars seem to be better candidate to probe substructures around galaxies .    additionally , to utilize gravitational lensing , substructures as lens objects should be close to the line of sight to the sources .",
    "substructures are not distributed uniformly in universe but clustered around their host galaxy , and the line of sight to the source should intersect in the vicinity of galaxies .",
    "e.g. , light from the source passes inside @xmath6 from the center of the host galaxy . in this point of view",
    ", we can also say that gravitationally lensed quasars are the most suitable system to probe substructures , because such systems automatically satisfy this condition .",
    "we will present more detailed discussion about optical depth for strong lensing by cdm substructures in section 5.2 .",
    "expected phenomena for gravitational lensing depend on the situation , lens model , some observational constraints and so on . to evaluate expected values for image separation and time delay between further multiple images , we describe adopted calculation methods for our estimations in this section .",
    "recently reported cosmological parameters measured by wmap ( @xcite ) is adopted here , i.e. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we set @xmath20 ( the lens redshift ) , @xmath21 ( the source redshift ) , @xmath22 ( or a corresponding velocity dispersion , the velocity dispersion ( @xmath23 ) for such object is expressed as @xmath24 ( @xcite ) . ] ) for a representative case unless otherwise specified .      in the strong lensing regime for a single lens object ,",
    "i.e. , a substructure , the external effects may dramatically change the properties of the lens object as a gravitational lens .",
    "the most important effects are external convergence and shear . generally , such external effects are caused by additional objects around the main lens object , a substructure in this case .",
    "there are two possible source to produce such effects in current situation .",
    "one is the host galaxy of substructures . as is well known in the argument for quasar microlensing and/or for constructing the macrolens model for gravitationally lensed quasars , the convergence around an image of gravitationally lensed quasars estimated to be order of unity ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the shear is roughly the same value as the convergence . in such situations ,",
    "even if the object is compact enough we can no more treat the main object as simple point mass lens , and we have to treat the lens as so - called `` chang - refsdal '' lens developed by @xcite . particularly , the shear effect dramatically change the lens properties and magnification pattern becomes cuspy asteroid shape from circular shape , though the convergence effect is the simple focusing of the lens and the source planes .",
    "thus , we include external convergence and shear effect in our calculation .",
    "since the typical lens size of substructures is much smaller than that of the host galaxy , we assume the external convergence and shear are constant .",
    "the magnification patterns in the case of `` chang - refsdal '' lens model are shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] .",
    "details for lens models are shown in section 3.2 .",
    "( 150mm,150mm)fig01.eps    another possible source to produce external effects is other structures , i.e. , other substructures in the vicinity of the main substructure .",
    "if the lens plane is crowded with substructures and the optical depth is almost equal to or larger than unity , the gravitational lens properties such as magnification pattern will become very complicated similar to quasar microlensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by using equation  [ eq : tau ] , results obtained by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xmath25 inside @xmath26 ) , and put an arbitral mass for substructure , we are able to check the expected optical depth for substructure lens",
    ". there are some uncertainty due to lens properties , but if we set @xmath27 , the expected value will become @xmath28 .",
    "as investigated by previous estimation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , probability distribution for shear ( @xmath29 ) which produced by ensemble of point mass lenses with an average dimensionless surface mass density ( @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 , is expressed as @xmath32 thus , cumulative probability distribution to produce a shear less than @xmath29 , @xmath33 , is evaluated as follows , @xmath34 @xmath30 is equivalent with @xmath7 in current situation , and @xmath35 for @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "effect of other substructures close to the main substructure is mostly less than @xmath37 as an additional external shear .",
    "even if we set @xmath38 , the expected external shear will be @xmath39 .",
    "these values are small compared with external shear produced by the host galaxy of substructures , and we may safely be able to treat a substructure as an isolated lens object .",
    "more detailed arguments are presented in section 5.2 , and will validate this `` single isolated lens '' treatment or `` chang - refsdal '' lens treatment .    as we have already noted in section 1 ,",
    "the target systems in our estimations , i.e. , gravitationally lensed quasars , frequently suffer quasar microlensing and flux of images can be fluctuate around some median value with fairly long time scale .",
    "however , we are mainly focus not on magnification but on image separation and time delay between further multiple images . since these two quantities are directly reflect the typical lens size and the size of stellar mass objects is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of substructures , the perturbation caused by stellar mass objects for quasar microlensing is negligibly small .",
    "then , we do not include any effect due to quasar microlensing .",
    "( 120mm,160mm)fig02.eps    finally , we have to mention about flux ratio between the primary brightest image ( @xmath40 ) and the secondary brightest image ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath42 , that is an important constraint to our estimations and will closely relate to the actual observational difficulties . to detect substructures by utilizing strong gravitational lensing , we have to hunt signals from further multiple images created by strong gravitational lens effect by cdm substructures .",
    "as schematically presented in figure  [ fig : schema ] , we will find further multiple images beside one of multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars with fine spatial resolution .",
    "even if we can not resolve further multiple images , we may be able to observe flux variation of a further multiple image superposed on that of another image .",
    "such phenomenon will be observed as `` echo''-like flux variations in intrinsic variabilities of quasars . since time lags of the `` echo''-like flux variation should be correspond to time delay between further multiple images , the measurement of the `` echo '' time lag is identical to the measurement of time delay between further multiple images .",
    "such measurement can be direct evidence for substructures around galaxies .",
    "however , actual observations suffer many kind of noises caused by detector , background objects , air glow and so on .",
    "therefore , if the secondary brightest image is too faint compared with the primary brightest image , the `` echo''-like signal from the secondary brightest image may be smeared out in noises and we will not be able to find any evidence for substructure . to take into account such observational difficulties , we put some limits on @xmath43 .",
    "contours for some constant @xmath43 are presented in figure  [ fig : contour ] for some cases .      for `` chang - refsdal '' lens treatment , the lens equation with external convergence ( @xmath44 ) and shear ( @xmath29 )",
    "is written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are arbitrary locations on the lens plane and bending angle at the location , respectively .",
    "the shear direction in this formula is parallel to @xmath48-axis . solving this equation for a given @xmath49",
    ", we obtain all the location of multiple images and can calculate separations between images . for image 1 at location @xmath50 and image 2 at location @xmath51 ,",
    "the image separation ( @xmath52 ) is calculated from @xmath53 . by using lens potential ( @xmath54 ) , arrival time delay ( @xmath55 ) from the light path without gravitational lens effect",
    "is written as @xmath56 .",
    "\\label{eq : delay}\\ ] ] time delay between images is the arrival time delay difference between images , and we obtain time delay by subtracting @xmath55 at an image from @xmath55 at other images .",
    "thus , for image 1 at location @xmath50 and image 2 at location @xmath51 , the time delay ( @xmath57 ) is calculated from @xmath58 . here , we apply two kind of lens models for substructures , one is point mass lens model and another is singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) lens model ( see section 6.1 for discussion about lens model ) .    for point mass lens model , the typical lens size is given by einstein ring radius , @xmath10 ( see equation  [ eq : einstein ] ) , and the bending angle ( @xmath47 ) at an arbitrary location on the lens plane ( @xmath59 )",
    "is expressed as @xmath60 additionally , the lens potential is given as follows @xmath61 for substructures with @xmath22 , @xmath10 and @xmath62 are equal to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , for sis lens model , the typical lens size , @xmath65 , is given as following form , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the velocity dispersion of substructures .",
    "the bending angle and the lens potential in this case is presented as @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . for substructure with @xmath70 , @xmath65 and @xmath71",
    "are equal to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .    to evaluate actual values for given redshifts and mass or velocity dispersions , it is not efficient to perform calculations for all parameter combinations . as shown in appendix 1 , image separation and time delay have scaling laws for typical lens sizes , and it must be convenient to utilize such scaling laws .",
    "image separations are simply proportional to @xmath10 for point mass lens and to @xmath65 for sis lens . for point mass lens",
    ", it is apparent that @xmath10 is proportional to mass of substructures .",
    "system - to - system variance or redshifts dependence of @xmath10 is shown in figure  [ fig : zdeptot ] ( a ) .",
    "( 170mm,60mm)fig03.eps    at least for currently known lens systems , @xmath10 values are factor of @xmath74 variance and system - to - system variance of expected image separations is not negligible but small . for sis lens ,",
    "@xmath65 is proportional to square of velocity dispersion of substructures .",
    "system - to - system variance of @xmath65 is also shown in figure  [ fig : zdeptot ] ( b ) .",
    "again , system - to - system variance is not negligible but small .",
    "time delays are proportional to square of @xmath10 for point mass lens , and to square of @xmath65 for sis lens .",
    "thus , dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath65 is @xmath75 for point mass lens and @xmath76 for sis lens , respectively .",
    "however , system - to - system variance is not so simple as the image separations , because we should take into account another term including system redshifts ( e.g. , see equation  [ eq : delay ] ) .",
    "the effect of this additional term is presented in figure  [ fig : zdeptot ] ( c ) .",
    "gradient of this contour is roughly inverse of that in figure  [ fig : zdeptot ] ( a ) and  [ fig : zdeptot ] ( b ) , and this additional effect will partly cancel out . particularly , for point",
    "mass lens , angular diameter distances are completely cancel out and only @xmath77 term remains as system - to - system variance .",
    "consequently , system - to - system variance is not so large , and our estimations present below will straightforwardly be applicable to any lens systems .",
    "if you require more detailed values , you will refer figure  [ fig : zdeptot ] , and will simply multiply proper factors to our results .      to estimate probability distributions for image separation and time delay between two brightest images",
    ", we performed monte - carlo simulation as follows ;    1 .   the source position is randomly determined within a circle .",
    "the maximum radius for the source position is determined that all region satisfies a required condition such as constraint on @xmath43 is included .",
    "2 .   solving the lens equation",
    ", we obtain all image positions and corresponding magnification factors for the given source position . selecting the brightest two images , we calculate flux ( @xmath78 ) ratio between the brightest two images",
    "if the flux ratio is smaller than a given constraint , i.e. , @xmath79 , the fainter image can also be observable and we will continue further calculation for obtaining probability distributions . therefore , resultant probabilities are conditional probabilities .",
    "if the flux ratio is larger than a given constraint , we will go back to the first step and perform the same calculation again for other source position .",
    "4 .   by using the source position which satisfy our constraint , we can easily evaluate image separation , @xmath52 , and time delay , @xmath57 , from equation  [ eq : angle ] and  [ eq : delay ] , respectively .    repeat the above procedures ( step @xmath80 ) for many times , and we obtain probability distributions for image separation and time delay . in this paper",
    ", we perform 50000 realizations . to achieve good accuracy for our calculations ,",
    "the maximum radius for the source is large enough . on the other hand , to perform efficient calculations , the radius should not be too large . then , we determine the maximum radius for the source positions by referring magnification patterns and contours of flux ratio such as presented in figure  [ fig : contour ] . though calculations for image separation and time delay are straight forward after we obtain image positions , calculations for image positions at a given source position are not , caused by the nature of lens equation . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we adopt a proper method which utilizing so - called `` ray - shooting '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our numerical code solve the lens equation with sufficiently good accuracy .",
    "here , we present probability distributions for image separation and time delay for different @xmath29 , @xmath44 , and @xmath43 in the case of a single substructure , i.e. , only one value for @xmath10 and @xmath65 .",
    "hereafter , cumulative distribution for quantity @xmath48 is presented as @xmath81 .",
    "the reasons for dependences on the parameters are also discussed in this section . to make situation clear",
    ", we consider a few representative value for each parameter .",
    "detailed values of our estimations or estimated values for other parameter sets are obtained via www .",
    "first of all , we fix external convergence value as @xmath82 and calculate probability distributions to investigate the effects of external shear for point mass lens case .",
    "cumulative probability distribution of image separation ( @xmath83 ) and time delay ( @xmath84 ) are presented in figure  [ fig : gdeppnt ] .",
    "as is clear from figure  [ fig : contour ] , the lens properties dramatically change from @xmath85 case to @xmath86 case , and we present the result of @xmath87 as a representative case for @xmath85 and that of @xmath88 as a representative case for @xmath86 .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)fig04.eps    compared with no - shear case ( @xmath89 ) , the shape of distribution dramatically changed and the range of distribution is extended toward large and small @xmath90 as depicted in upper panel of figure  [ fig : gdeppnt ] . though the lowest value of the distribution become small , the most part of the distribution shifted toward large @xmath90 direction by some factor .",
    "the shear effect will make the detection of quasar mesolensing signal easier .",
    "however , if the shear is too large and exceed unity , e.g. , @xmath91 , the most part of the distribution shifted toward small @xmath90 direction by some factor .",
    "therefore , too large shear will make the detection of quasar mesolensing signal more difficult .    since time delay is directly affected by image separation ( see equation  [ eq : delay ] ) , the dependence on the external shear is similar to the image separation as depicted in lower panel of figure  [ fig : gdeppnt ] .",
    "the shape of the distribution of time delay is apparently different from that of the image separation , but qualitative features are the same . in large @xmath29 case",
    ", the distribution extends toward large and small @xmath84 direction , and larger time delay will be expected compared with no - shear case . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution shifted toward small @xmath84 direction in the case of @xmath29 exceed unity again and the substructure detection via quasar mesolensing will become difficult .      here , we present the expected values for sis lens model . before discussing the probability distribution",
    ", we briefly mention about basic properties of sis lens model .",
    "it is well known that sis lens produces pseudo - caustics at @xmath92 .",
    "generally , image separation increases with the source separate from the lens ( detailed explanations are presented in section 4.4 ) .",
    "if the source locate outside both of caustics and pseudo - caustics , only one image appears , and we can not define any quantities relate to our current estimations .",
    "thus , different from the point mass lens , image pair can not separate so large in the case of sis , and the distribution shows sharp drop / rise at large value compared with point mass lens case , as presented in figure  [ fig : gdepsis ] .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)fig05.eps    it is apparent that the resultant cumulative distributions show different shape from that for point mass lens case .",
    "this is partly due to the unique nature of sis lens model that we mentioned just before",
    ". additionally , expected values are smaller than that for point mass lens case by a several factor .",
    "however , the dependence on external shear is qualitatively same as that for point mass lens case , i.e. , large external shear makes expected values large but too large external shear , @xmath93 , makes expected values small .",
    "there is no essential difference between these two lens models , and we mainly focus on point mass lens model at the following part .      as is already noted by @xcite , external convergence leads degeneracy problem for modeling of lens objects .",
    "in contrast , if we fix lens model as current estimations , thanks to the simple nature of convergence , effects of external convergence can be easily take into account as proper scaling laws .",
    "clearly , the convergence term in equation  [ eq : angle ] will eliminate , if we divide both side of the equation by @xmath94 . after eliminating the convergence term , the lens equation becomes similar form again , and the shear term changes from @xmath29 to @xmath95 .",
    "following some algebra as presented in appendix 2 , we obtain the scaling laws of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath96 ( total magnification ) for point mass lens model as @xmath97 and that for sis lens model as @xmath98 therefore , to obtain the distributions for non - zero convergence and shear , @xmath29 , case , we calculate zero convergence with equivalent effective shear , @xmath99 , case , and horizontally shift the resultant distributions by a proper factor .      at the end of this section , we present dependence on our assumed value for @xmath43 that will mimic constraint for real observations . here , we already have scaling laws for convergence , fixed shear value as @xmath100 and present the resultant distributions for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 case in figure  [ fig : fdeppnt ] .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)fig06.eps    in upper panel of figure  [ fig : fdeppnt ] , image separation , the shape of the distribution does not change so much in horizontal direction but changes toward downward slightly with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "then , the expected values becomes large with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "the reason is easily understood from the following analogy .",
    "the source separate enough from the lens , number of images becomes two .",
    "the more the source and the lens separates , the more these two images separates because one image is formed near the original source position , or the source position without lens effect , and another image is formed near the lens position . at the same time , since the image near the original source position becomes faint toward the original source flux , i.e. , lower limit is the original source flux , since another image near the lens position becomes faint toward infinitely small flux , i.e. , lower limit is zero .",
    "the image near the original source is usually brighter than another image , and finally , @xmath43 increase toward infinity with the source and the lens separation .",
    "if we allow large value for @xmath43 , it will be comparable to the situation that we can observe fainter images .",
    "in such a case , we can observe more separate image pairs as the above argument , and the expected image separation becomes large .",
    "however , the fainter image becomes rapidly faint with the source and the lens separation , and change of the distribution is not significantly .    due to the same reason ,",
    "the distribution of time delay only slightly changes with @xmath43 as clearly shown in lower panel of figure  [ fig : fdeppnt ] .",
    "time delay relates to @xmath104 rather than @xmath90 , and difference between the distribution for different @xmath43 seems to be large compared with that of image separation .",
    "we note that the expected value becomes large with increasing @xmath43 , again .",
    "employing basic properties for quasar mesolensing that presented in the previous section , we can evaluate really expected value for image separation and time delay due to quasar mesolensing including statistical properties of substructures .      to obtain",
    "expected values in a real situation , we have to include mass or velocity distribution of substructure .",
    "as shown previous sections , probability distributions are determined by @xmath5 ( or @xmath67 for sis lens ) via the lens size , @xmath44 , @xmath29 , and @xmath43 .",

    "in contrast , lower limits are comparable to the current resolution ( around @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) and somewhat unclear .",
    "of course , if we include small mass ( or velocity ) scale , number of substructures will increase and optical depth for quasar mesolensing will also increase .",
    "however , the expected image separation and time delay for such small scale structure should be small , and it can be difficult to detect .",
    "therefore , we only take into account the mass and the velocity range for the previous simulations , and set @xmath123 , @xmath124 . for the velocity range",

    "the expected time delay for point mass lens is larger than that of sis lens , again .",
    "difference between different lens model and different @xmath127 is somewhat larger , but lower value for time delay is @xmath135 and upper value is @xmath136 . of course , even in the case of @xmath136 , it is not easy task to find echo - like flux variation due to quasar mesolensing in quasar variabilities with stochastic feature .",
    "however , this sub - day level time delay may be found by some coordinated monitoring observations in future ( see also discussion ) .",
    "reality for quasar mesolensing is evaluated by optical depth of gravitational lensing due to substructure .",

    "the second fraction term in the right - hand side is the stretching effect of source plane and similar to so - called `` magnification bias '' .",
    "column number density of substructures is estimated in the lens plane , but the lens plane have already been magnified by a factor identical to this term , @xmath140 . if we trace back to a region from the lens plane to the source plane , the surface area will become small by this factor .",
    "consequently , column number density of substructures is increased by a factor @xmath140 .",
    "cross section of quasar mesolensing for a given mass or velocity strongly depends on @xmath44 , @xmath29 , and other constraints ( @xmath43 in this case ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to calculate the cross section analytically in current situation ( but see @xcite for similar situations ) , and we evaluated it by using our monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : crssct ] .",
    "( 100mm,140mm)fig09.eps    for @xmath44 dependence , we can derive from scaling law for @xmath49 between non - zero convergence case and zero convergence case with the same effective shear ( see also appendix 2 ) . in case of point mass lens model , @xmath49 scaled by a factor of @xmath141 from zero convergence case , and the cross section scaled by a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "however , in case of sis lens model , @xmath49 does not alter by the effect of convergence , and the cross section is not affected by convergence . then , @xmath139 is proportional to @xmath94 for point mass lens , and shows no dependence on @xmath44 for sis lens . on the other hand",

    "particularly , in @xmath85 regime , asteroid - shape caustics dramatically grows with the increase of @xmath29 .",
    "of course , we can take into account such behavior into current estimation , but we simply set @xmath139 equals to @xmath143 for point mass lens and @xmath144 for sis lens . if the readers want to know more detailed values , figure  [ fig : crssct ] can be the reference for this purpose .    from @xcite , @xmath145 and @xmath146 inside @xmath147 radius in current situation .",
    "] of the lens galaxy .",
    "after we perform the integration in equation  [ eq : crsitgpnt ] and  [ eq : crsitgsis ] , we can obtain @xmath148 for point mass lens and @xmath149 for sis lens .",
    "in general , multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars are magnified by a several or a few tenth factor that is identical to @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that roughly ten percent of multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars are affected by quasar mesolensing due to substructures .",
    "the above values also depend on the spatial distribution of substructures .",
    "if substructures are concentrated within @xmath150 radius which is typical separation between the center of lens galaxy and multiple quasar images , column number density of substructures should be larger than that we used here , and the optical depth will increase from our results .",
    "here , we mention about density profile of substructures . to calculate gravitational lens effects and expected values , we require density profile for each substructure . unfortunately , even in the case of high resolution , cosmological n - body simulations for galaxy formation do not have enough mass resolutions for substructures , because an individual mass of a dark matter particle is too large and most of substructures are consists from a small number of dark matter particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . thus , in this paper , we simply treat density profile of substructures as point mass or singular isothermal sphere .",
    "as is well known , properties of gravitational lens phenomena depend on density profile of lens objects , and differences of expected values between these two lens models reflect such dependence .",
    "in general , further multiple images are created when the density slope of lens object is smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "if nfw universal density profile ( @xcite ) holds even in the small objects such as substructures , size of substructures as lens object will be smaller than size of core radius of substructures .",
    "consequently , the density slope of substructures is almost identical to that of core region of nfw - profile , @xmath152 . in this case",
    ", we can not find any further multiple images caused by quasar mesolensing , and magnification anomaly can be a unique probe to detect substructures .",
    "however , we still not have any evidence that nfw - profile holds in small scale such as substructures observationally and theoretically , and observational search for further multiple images caused by quasar mesolensing must be a good approach to test density profile of substructures . if we find signals relate to further multiple images , that is observational evidence not only for existence of numerous substructures but also substructure has density profile which is different from nfw - profile . on the other hand ,",
    "even if we fail to find such signals expect magnification anomaly , density profile of substructure should be similar to nfw - profile .      the cumulative distribution of the total magnification depicted in figure  [ fig : tmagpnt ] and  [ fig : tmagsis ] for point mass lens case and sis lens case , respectively .",
    "these figures are valid both of individual mass ( or velocity ) lens case and lens mass- ( or velocity- ) integrated case , because magnification does not include any information about lens mass ( or velocity ) and its properties are same for same convergence and shear case , even if we integrate over mass ( or velocity ) distribution of lens objects .",
    "( 80mm,100mm)fig10.eps    ( 80mm,100mm)fig11.eps    different from the distributions for the image separation and the time delay , these distributions consist from a few bump ( or sharp rise / drop ) .",
    "this feature means that the expected value is clustered around a few location .",
    "when the external shear is added to axi - symmetric lens model , asteroid - shape caustics or highly magnified regions appear and such regions extend with increasing the shear value .",
    "existence of caustics dramatically changes the magnification pattern , and the shape of distribution becomes to have two or more bump though only single bump appears in the case of no - shear .",
    "this feature is clearly seen in upper panels of figure  [ fig : tmagpnt ] and  [ fig : tmagsis ] .",
    "the bump at the high @xmath96 range corresponds to the distribution that the source is inside caustics .",
    "however , @xmath127 exceeds unity , caustics suddenly change from single asteroid shape to double triangle shape as shown in figure  [ fig : contour ] . following",
    "this dramatic change of magnification properties , demagnified region that never exist in the case of @xmath153 will appear , and the distribution widely extend toward @xmath154 direction .",
    "this feature can clearly be seen in @xmath155 in upper panels of figure  [ fig : tmagpnt ] and  [ fig : tmagsis ] , again . in both lens model , expected value for the magnification reduced by a several factor .",
    "it has been already known that some combination of convergence and shear , particularly in the case of @xmath156 , produces demagnified images . from our estimations , it becomes clear that the existence of substructures in lens galaxy sometime causes strong demagnification in an image of multiple quasars .",
    "if we find multiple quasars with odd number images , such systems may be possible candidate for quasars with such strongly demagnified image , and this can be also useful to direct detection for quasar mesolensing and substructures .    here , we should note that these probability distributions for the total magnification show different properties from that presented by previous researches ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the reason is that the distribution in this paper include a condition to take into account observational constraint , @xmath43 , though that in previous researches does not .    for @xmath43 dependence of the total magnification , ( lower panels of figure  [ fig : tmagpnt ] and  [ fig : tmagsis ] , the reason for the change",
    "is explained by the same argument as @xmath43 dependence of image separation in section 4.4 .",
    "large @xmath43 means that we can observe fainter image .",
    "the more the lens and the source separate , the larger @xmath43 becomes . at the same time , the total magnification becomes small with increase of separation between the lens and the source , because flux of the brightest image approaches to the original source flux and flux of the secondly brightest image approaches to zero .",
    "therefore , the distribution for large @xmath43 includes such source position case with low magnification ( almost unity ) , and the probability at low @xmath96 increase .",
    "in contrast , the source position at high @xmath96 is close to the lens and flux of all image is comparable , i.e. , @xmath43 is almost unity .",
    "consequently , if we increase @xmath43 , the source position with high magnification may not be newly included .",
    "this is the reason why the shape at high @xmath96 shows no dramatic change .",
    "this result indicates that we may easily be able to detect quasar mesolensing signal in multiple quasar with weak magnification anomaly , if we achieve sufficiently high @xmath43 or can detect fainter images .",
    "further multiple images will be unambiguously detected , if the spatial resolution is sufficiently fine .",
    "in contrast , for echo - like flux variation is not so simple . to confirm that the observed , echo - like flux variations are really due to quasar mesolensing , quasar microlensing seems to be somewhat confusing phenomenon .",
    "however , the time scale of echo - like flux variations is identical to the time scale of intrinsic quasar variabilities , and the shape of flux variations is also identical to that of intrinsic ones , because gravitational lens effect does not alter the time scale and the shape of flux variations , in principle .",
    "only the difference between echo - like flux variations and intrinsic ones is the flux caused by a magnification factor difference .",
    "moreover , the time scale of quasar microlensing is event time scales of microlensing event , and basically different from that of echo - like flux variations .",
    "then , if we monitor all image of multiple quasars , we can easily obtain intrinsic flux variations of quasars at least from one of the images , because probability that all image suffers quasar mesolensing is less than one percent from previous estimates ( section 5.2 ) .    additionally , echo - like flux variations due to quasar mesolensing occur recurrently during a reasonable epoch , whereas quasar microlensing events occur occasionally .",
    "time scale for quasar microlensing in usual system is expected to be a few year ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , duration of quasar mesolensing is roughly estimated to be @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is velocity of motion of substructures around galaxy .",
    "if we adopt @xmath121 substructure and @xmath159 for @xmath158 , the time scale becomes @xmath160 .",
    "duration of quasar mesolensing is sufficiently large compared with our life time , and we can treat quasar mesolensing as static gravitational lensing event . from this argument ,",
    "echo - like flux variations due to quasar mesolensing is recurrent event , and the echo - like flux variations occur every time when the background quasars show their intrinsic flux variations .",
    "this property makes us easier to detect echo - like flux variation and substructures via quasar mesolensing .",
    "quasar mesolensing occurs in @xmath3 of images in multiple quasars , and we will be able to hunt such further multiple images as a direct evidence for substructures by using observational missions / facilities with @xmath161 spatial resolution or @xmath162 time resolution .",
    "these expected values are not identical in different systems and images , because external convergence and shear due to the lens galaxy are different from system to system and from image to image .",
    "therefore , to estimate the expected values more accurately in an individual system , we have to obtain @xmath44 and @xmath29 of images via modeling of the lens galaxy .",
    "subsequently , calculate probability distributions for the observables as we shown in this paper . by comparing such probability distribution and observational results",
    ", we may be able to discuss about existence and nature of substructures .    to find further multiple images caused by quasar mesolensing directly",
    ", we require observational facility with @xmath163-level spatial resolution .",
    "there is also non - zero probability to realize further multiple images with the separation @xmath164 .",
    "unfortunately , flux ratio of such image pairs is large , and the fainter image can be too faint to be detected feasibly .",
    "thus , we really require @xmath163 spatial resolution to detect quasar mesolensing .",
    "if we observe images with spatial resolution further below this value , we will clearly detect that the image is consisted by two or more images , and this can be the evidence for the existence of substructures . even if we perform observation with marginal spatial resolution , we will find one or more structure is attached around the image , and this can be also the evidence for substructures .",
    "simple way to achieve high spatial resolution is to use interferometers , but it may be practically difficult .",
    "the reason is that the light from multiple quasars images pass inside the lens galaxy , and the light suffers the effect such as scintillation due to relatively dense inter stellar medium .",
    "therefore , not interferometric but direct observation is necessary and forthcoming observational instruments such as xmas ( @xcite ) spatial resolution in x - ray .",
    "] will be required .",
    "another solution to find signal due to further multiple images is to hunt echo - like flux variations with @xmath165 delay . in this case , high spatial resolution is not required any more , but high time resolution or high speed monitoring is required .",
    "observations of quasars that show rapid and large flare - like flux variations are preferable to search echo - like signal .",
    "generally , quasars always show stochastic flux variations , and it is practically difficult to find out echo - like flux variations due to quasar mesolensing of small flares with long duration . in contrast , large flares with short duration can be clearly detected from stochastic flux variations of quasars , and we can easily pick up corresponding echo - like flux variations due to quasar mesolensing . considering this point , for example , observation of rapid x - ray flares with time scale of @xmath166 ( e.g. , @xcite ) that have recently detected in multiple quasars can be one of the best target . furthermore ,",
    "owing to shortness of the time delay , echo - like flux variation may be found by single observation with x - ray satellite .",
    "duration of single observation with x - ray satellite is usually a several tenth of @xmath166 , and sufficiently longer than expected time delay estimated in this paper .",
    "thus , if we can detect such rapid x - ray flare and a substructure fortunately located in the vicinity of the image , we will be able to prove the existence of substructures by only single observation .",
    "in the situation we are considering here , target quasar has multiple image , and we can discriminate echo - like flux variation due to quasar mesolensing from stochastic intrinsic flux variations in quasars by comparing flux variations in other images . for this confirmation purpose ,",
    "multiple quasars with less than a day time delay between images are the ideal targets , because corresponding flux variations of delayed image also be able to observed by a single observation and other confusing phenomena such as quasar microlensing can be easily rejected .    a rapid x - ray flare detected in rx  j0911.4 + 0511 by @xcite corresponds to @xmath167 in chandra .",
    "to detect echo - like flux variation with @xmath168 confidence level , more than @xmath169 photons for a fainter image are required within a time bin .",
    "this @xmath168 detection limits is almost comparable to @xmath170 constraint . referring figure  [ fig : fdeppnt ] ,",
    "@xmath171 constraint reduces expected time delay by a several factor from @xmath172 constraint that we have applied to calculate figure  [ fig : tdeppnt ] . even in this case ,",
    "probability for @xmath173 delay is non - zero , and we will be able to detect echo - like flux variations by using chandra capability . for actual observation ,",
    "it is better to perform such observation to multiple quasars with magnification anomaly than blind search , because magnification anomaly occurs also in this quasar mesolensing and such multiple quasars may have systematically high probability to show echo - like flux variation caused by quasar mesolensing than usual multiple quasars .",
    "the above discussion is limited on a case with @xmath136 time delay .",
    "if there is no x - ray flares with larger amplitude than that @xcite have detected , we will have to wait x - ray facility with large collecting area such as xeus or choose waveband with large signal - to - noise ratio for flares to find the evidence of substructures clearly and strongly .",
    "expected time delay with shorter than @xmath136 has significant fraction in cumulative distribution of the time delay as apparently shown in figure  [ fig : tdeppnt ] and  [ fig : tdepsis ] , and observational facilities with large collecting area or waveband that realize high signal - to - noise ratio will open a window to detect shorter time delay events .    until now , phenomena that we are investigated here are not detected , but some coordinated future observations enable us to reveal the existence of substructures around galaxies if cdm scenario for structure formation is totally correct .",

    "here , we consider the case when the lens size is multiplied by a factor @xmath174 and derive scaling law of image separation and time delay between images .",
    "we put @xmath175 and @xmath176 instead of @xmath59 and @xmath49 , respectively , the lens equation becomes @xmath177 if we divide both side of the equation by @xmath174 , it reduce to @xmath178 and this equation is apparently the same form as the lens equation in the case of point mass lens for @xmath10 .",
    "thus , image separation between multiple images becomes @xmath179 and is scaled simply by a factor of @xmath174 compared with the case of @xmath10 .    for arrival time delay ,",
    "the equation becomes following , @xmath180.\\ ] ] all the term in the right hand side scaled by a factor of @xmath181 except the last term .",
    "fortunately , the observable is not arrival time delay but time delay between multiple images , @xmath57 , and @xmath174 inside @xmath182 in the last term vanishes when we subtract @xmath183 from @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the time delay between multiple images is scaled simply by a factor of @xmath181 compared with the case of @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath185 .    the magnification factor for one image ( @xmath186 )",
    "is calculated from jacobian matrix for @xmath187 transformation , and written as @xmath188 thus , applying proper re - scaling for @xmath59 and @xmath49 , there is no need to additional scaling for the magnification .      applying the same scaling to @xmath49 and @xmath59 as the point mass lens , the bending angle ( @xmath47 ) and the lens potential ( @xmath54 ) for sis lens model become @xmath189 and @xmath190 respectively , and the same scaling law as point mass lens case holds also in this case .",
    "it is apparent that the scaling law for the magnification properties is same as the case for the point mass lens .",
    "here , we derive scaling laws for convergence . we consider lens equations and arrival time delays for two cases , non - zero convergence ( @xmath44 ) and shear ( @xmath29 ) case and zero convergence and non - zero shear ( @xmath127 ) case . in the latter case ,",
    "shear is equivalent with the effective shear for the former case , i.e. , @xmath191 .",

    "in this case , lens equations for both case are written as @xmath199 if we set @xmath200 in equation  [ eq : lenstrns1 ] , the lens equation becomes similar form to equation  [ eq : lenstrns2 ] . from dependence on lens size presented in appendix 1.1 , the source and the image positions of non - zero convergence case",
