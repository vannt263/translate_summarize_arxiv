    "most of the studies on the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) in dynamical systems have been devoted to systems driven by sinusoidal terms ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "several analytical approximations have been put forward to explain sr . in the approach of mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite ,",
    "the langevin dynamics is replaced by a reduced two - state model that neglects the intra - well dynamics .",
    "the general ideas of linear response theory ( lrt ) have been applied to situations where the input amplitude is small @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the floquet theory has been applied to the corresponding fokker - planck description .",
    "for very low input frequencies , an adiabatic ansatz has been invoked @xcite .",
    "even though these alternative analytical approaches provide an explanation of sr for different regions of parameter values , their precise limits of validity remain to be determined . in recent work ,",
    "@xcite we have explored the validity of lrt for sinusoidal and multifrequency input signals with low frequency .",
    "our results indicate a breakdown of the lrt description of the average behavior for low frequency , subthreshold amplitude inputs .",
    "several quantifiers have been used to characterize sr in noisy , continuous , systems .",
    "the average output amplitude , or the spectral amplification ( spa ) , has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and the phase of the output average in refs .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "those parameters as well as the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite , exhibit a non - monotonic behavior with the noise strength which is representative of sr .",
    "an important quantity is the sr - gain , defined as the ratio of the snr of the output over the input snr .",
    "it has been repeatedly pointed out that the sr - gain can not exceed unity as long as the system operates in a regime described by lrt @xcite . beyond lrt",
    "there exists no physical reason that prevents the sr - gain to be larger than @xmath0 , as it has been demonstrated in @xcite for super - threshold sinusoidal input signals , and in analog experiments in @xcite for subthreshold input signals with many fourier components and a small duty cycle @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will make use of numerical solutions of the langevin equation following the methodology in @xcite , to analyze sr in noisy bistable systems , driven by periodic piecewise constant signal with two amplitude values of opposite signs ( rectangular signal ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fuerza ] ) .",
    "there are several relevant time scales in the dynamics of these systems : i ) @xmath1 , the time interval within each half period of the driving force , during which the diffusing particle sees an asymmetric constant two - well potential ; ii ) @xmath2 , the time scale associated with the inter - well transitions in both directions ; and iii ) @xmath3 , the time scale associated to intra - well dynamics .",
    "the inter - well and intra - well time scales depend basically on the noise strength @xmath4 and the amplitude of the driving term .",
    "the dependence of these two time scales with those parameters is certainly very different , being more pronounced for @xmath2 .",
    "typically , for the range of parameter values associated with sr , the intra - well time scale is shorter than the inter - well one .",
    "we will evaluate the long - time average behavior of the output and the second cumulant .",
    "these two quantities were studied some time ago by two of us @xcite for periodic rectangular driving signals . here , we will further extend our work to the analysis of the correlation function and its coherent and incoherent parts .",
    "the knowledge of all these quantities provides a very useful information for the explanation of sr as indicated by the non - monotonic behavior with the noise strength of the output amplitude and the snr .",
    "in particular , the knowledge of the incoherent part of the correlation function is of outmost importance for a correct determination of the snr .",
    "furthermore , for a given subthreshold amplitude , we will demonstrate that , if there exist a range of noise values such that @xmath2 is shorter than @xmath1 , then it is possible to observe stochastic amplification and , simultaneously , sr - gains larger than unity .",
    "this is strictly forbidden by linear response theory , as we have recently shown @xcite .",
    "thus , a simultaneous appearance of stochastic amplification and sr - gains above @xmath0 implies a strong violation of linear response theory .",
    "let us consider a system characterized by a single degree of freedom , @xmath5 , subject to the action of a zero average gaussian white noise with @xmath6 and driven by an external periodic signal @xmath7 with period @xmath8 . in the langevin description ,",

    ", we will consider a bistable potential @xmath15 .",
    "the periodicity of the external driving @xmath7 allows its fourier series expansion in the harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17,\\ ] ] with the fourier coefficients , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , given by @xmath20 here , we are assuming that the cycle average of the external driving over its period equals zero . in this work",
    ", we will focus our attention to multi - frequency input forces with `` rectangular '' shape given by @xmath21 as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fuerza ] .",
    "the external force remains constant at a value @xmath22 during each half - period and changes sign for the second half of the period .",
    "the duty cycle of the signal is defined by the time span the signal is nonzero over the total period of the signal ; thus , the rectangular signal in eq .",
    "( [ pulse ] ) consequently possesses a duty cycle of unity .",
    "the two - time correlation function @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the time - periodic , asymptotic long time solution of the fpe and the quantity @xmath27 denotes the two - time conditional probability density that the stochastic variable will have a value near @xmath5 at time @xmath28 if its value at time @xmath29 was exactly @xmath30 .",
    "it can been shown @xcite that , in the limit @xmath24 , the two - time correlation function @xmath31 becomes a periodic function of @xmath29 with the period of the external driving .",
    "then , we define the one - time correlation function , @xmath32 , as the average of the two - time correlation function over a period of the external driving , i.e. , @xmath33 the correlation function @xmath32 can be written exactly as the sum of two contributions : a coherent part , @xmath34 , which is periodic in @xmath35 with period @xmath8 , and an incoherent part which decays to @xmath36 for large values of @xmath35 .",
    "the coherent part @xmath34 is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the average value evaluated with the asymptotic form of the probability density , @xmath26 .",
    "according to mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite , the output snr is defined in terms of the fourier transform of the coherent and incoherent parts of @xmath32 . as",
    "the correlation function is even in time and we evaluate its time dependence for @xmath39 , it is convenient to use its fourier cosine transform , defined as @xmath40 the value of the output snr is then obtained from : @xmath41 note that this definition of the snr differs by a factor @xmath42 , stemming from the same contribution at @xmath43 , from the definitions used in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the coherent part gives rise to delta peaks in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the only contribution to the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) stems from the coherent part of the correlation function .",
    "the evaluation of the snr requires the knowledge of the fourier components of @xmath34 and @xmath44 at the fundamental frequency of the driving force .",
    "thus , rather than knowledge of the entire fourier spectrum , only two well defined numerical quadratures are needed .",
    "these are : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 the snr for an input signal @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 the sr - gain @xmath50 is consequently defined as the ratio of the snr of the output over the snr of the input , namely , @xmath51",
    "stochastic trajectories , @xmath52 , are generated by numerically integrating the langevin equation [ eq .  ( [ langev ] ) ] for every realization @xmath53 of the white noise @xmath54 , starting from a given initial condition @xmath55 .",
    "the numerical solution is based on the algorithm developed by greenside and helfand @xcite ( consult also the appendix in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . after allowing for a relaxation transient stage ,",
    "we start recording the time evolution of each random trajectory for many different trajectories .",
    "then , we construct the long time average value , @xmath56 and the second cumulant , @xmath57 ^ 2 - \\left [ \\frac 1n \\sum_{j=1}^n x^{(j)}(t ) \\right ] ^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the number of stochastic trajectories considered .",
    "we also evaluate the two - time ( @xmath29 and @xmath35 ) correlation function , i.e. , @xmath59 as well as the product of the averages @xmath60 \\left [ \\frac 1n \\sum_{j=1}^n x^{(j)}(t )   \\right ] .\\ ] ] the correlation function @xmath32 and its coherent part @xmath34 are then obtained using their definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ ctau ] ) and ( [ chtau ] ) , performing the cycle average over one period of @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between the values of @xmath32 and @xmath34 allows us to obtain the values for @xmath44 .",
    "it is then straightforward to evaluate the fourier component of @xmath34 and the fourier transform of @xmath44 at the driving frequency by numerical quadrature . with that information , the numerator and the denominator for the output snr [ cf .",
    "eqs.([snr1 ] ) , ( [ num ] ) and ( [ den ] ) ] , as well as the sr - gain [ cf .",
    "( [ gain ] ) ] , are obtained .",
    "consider an external driving of the type sketched in fig .",
    "[ fuerza ] with parameter values @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "this amplitude is well below its threshold value defined , for each driving frequency , as the minimum amplitude that can induce repeated transitions between the minima of @xmath14 in the absence of noise . for the input considered here ,",
    "the threshold amplitude is @xmath63 .",
    "note that this threshold value for the amplitude increases with increasing driving frequency .    in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] we depict with several panels the behavior of the first two cumulants , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , for several representative values of @xmath4 [ from top to bottom @xmath66 ( panel a ) , @xmath67 ( panel b ) , @xmath68 ( panel c ) , @xmath69 ( panel d ) and @xmath70 ( panel e ) ] .",
    "notice that due to the transients , the time at which we start recording data , @xmath71 in the graphs , does not necessarily coincide with the start of an external cycle .",
    "the average is periodic with the period of the driving force , while the second cumulant , due to the reflection symmetry of the potential @xcite , is periodic with a period half of the period of the forcing term .",
    "next we consider the case of small noise intensity @xmath4 ( say , @xmath66 as in panel a ) .",
    "the noise induces jumps between the wells . in each random trajectory ,",
    "a jump between the wells has a very short duration , but the instants of time at which they take place for the different stochastic trajectories are randomly distributed during a half - cycle . at this small noise strength ,",
    "the jumps are basically towards the lowest minimum .",
    "thus , because of this statistical effect , the average behavior depicts the smooth evolution depicted in panel a of fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] , without sudden transitions between the wells .",
    "the evolution of the second cumulant adds relevant information .",
    "the fact that it is rather large during most of a period indicates that the probability density @xmath72 is basically bimodal during most of the external cycle .",
    "it is only during very short time intervals around each half - period that the probability distribution becomes monomodal around one of the minima , and , consequently , the second cumulant is small .",
    "the bimodal character arises from the fact that the noise is so small in comparison with the barrier heights that jumps over the barrier are rather infrequent during each half a period .    as the noise strength increases",
    ", the time evolution of @xmath73 follows closely the shape of the external force , ( cf .",
    "see panels b , c , d in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] for @xmath74 ) .",
    "this behavior indicates that , for these parameter values , the jumps in the different random trajectories are concentrated within short time intervals around the instants of time at which the driving force switches sign .",
    "the second cumulant remains very small during most of a period , except for short time intervals around the switching times of the external driver .",
    "thus , for these intermediate values of @xmath4 , the probability distribution , @xmath72 is basically monomodal , except for small time intervals around the switching instants of time of the periodic driver . finally , as the noise strength",
    "is further increased ( @xmath75 ) , the probability distribution remains very broad most of the time .",
    "even though a large majority of random trajectories will still jump over the barrier in synchrony with the switching times of the driver , the noise is so large in comparison with the barrier heights , that the probability of crossings over the barrier in both directions can not be neglected at any time during each half cycle .",
    "the probability distribution remains bimodal during a whole period , but asymmetric : the larger fraction of the probability accumulates around the corresponding lower minima of the potential during each cycle .",
    "therefore , the average output amplitude decreases , while the second cumulant depicts plateaus at higher values than for smaller noise strengths ( compare panels e and c in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ wp2 ] , we plot the coherent ( left panels ) , @xmath34 , and incoherent ( right panels ) , @xmath44 , components of the correlation function @xmath32 for the same parameter values as in fig .",
    "the coherent part shows oscillations with a period equal to that of the driving force .",
    "its shape changes with @xmath4 .",
    "the amplitude of the coherent part does not grow monotonically with @xmath4 .",
    "rather , it maximizes at @xmath76 , which is consistent with the observed behavior of @xmath77 in fig .",
    "this is expected as the evaluation of @xmath34 involves only the time behavior of @xmath77 at two different instants of time .",
    "two features of the behavior of @xmath44 are relevant : its initial value and its decay time .",
    "the initial value of the incoherent contribution , @xmath78 , is given by the cycle average of the second cumulant .",
    "it has a non - monotonic behavior with @xmath4 . for @xmath66",
    ", @xmath78 is large , consistent with the fact that the second cumulant at this noise strength is appreciably different from @xmath36 during a substantial part of a period . as the value of @xmath4 increases , ( @xmath79 ) , the value of @xmath78 decreases .",
    "this is expected as the second cumulant is large just during those small time intervals where most of the forward transitions take place every half - period . for still larger values of @xmath4",
    "there are frequent forward and backward jumps that keep the stationary probability bimodal , and therefore , the initial value @xmath78 increases . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the decay of @xmath44 is very slow , although the decay time is still shorter than the duration of half a period of the driving force .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , the decay time of the incoherent part becomes shorter .",
    "it is worth to point out that the intra - well noisy dynamics manifests itself in the behavior of @xmath44 .",
    "this is most clearly confirmed noticing the fast initial decay observed in panel d. for smaller values of @xmath4 , this feature is masked by the long total relaxation time scale , while for @xmath70 , the noise strength is so large that there is not a clear - cut separation between inter and intra - well time scales .",
    "the above considerations allow us to rationalize the behavior of the several quantifiers used to characterize sr .",
    "their behaviors with @xmath4 for @xmath62 , @xmath61 are depicted in fig .",
    "it should be noticed that the lowest value of the noise strength used in the numerical solution of the langevin equation is @xmath80 . for this noise strength ,",
    "the values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are very small , although not zero . for even lower noise strengths",
    "the task becomes computationally very demanding and expensive , due to the extremely slow decay of the correlations . for @xmath4",
    "sufficiently small , however , one does expect @xmath81 to be larger than @xmath83 , and , consequently , an increase of the numerical @xmath82 as @xmath4 is lowered .    the quantity @xmath81 defined in eq .",
    "( [ num ] ) depicts a non - monotonic dependence on @xmath4 typical of the sr phenomenon .",
    "its behavior is expected from the dependence of the amplitude of @xmath34 with @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ wp2 ] .    a non - monotonic behavior with @xmath4 for the numerically evaluated @xmath83 is also observed . the initial value , @xmath78 and the decay time of @xmath44 are important in the evaluation of @xmath83 [ see eq .",
    "( [ den ] ) ] .",
    "for @xmath80 , the decay time of the incoherent part of the correlation function is longer than half a period of the driving force , while for @xmath66 , it is somewhat shorter than @xmath84 . consistently with eq .",
    "( [ den ] ) , the value of the integral for @xmath80 is smaller than for @xmath66 . as @xmath4 is further increased , the influence of the cosine factor in eq .",
    "( [ den ] ) becomes less important as the decay time is much shorter than @xmath84 .",
    "the drastic fall in the @xmath83 values observed for @xmath85 is due to the decrease of @xmath78 with @xmath4 ( see panels a - c in fig .  [ wp2 ] ) and the shortening of the decay time . as @xmath4 is increased further , @xmath78 increases and , consequently , @xmath83 also increases slightly .    taking into account the definition of the snr , [ cf .",
    "( [ snr1 ] ) ] , its behavior with @xmath4 is not surprising .",
    "the numerically obtained snr peaks at @xmath86 , a slightly different value of @xmath4 from the one at which @xmath81 peaks .",
    "the sr - gain is defined in eq .",
    "( [ gain ] ) .",
    "the numerically determined sr - gain shows a most interesting feature : we observe a non - monotonic behavior versus @xmath4 , with values for the gain exceeding unity ( ! ) for a whole range of noise strengths .",
    "this is strictly forbidden within lrt @xcite ; therefore , the fact that the sr - gain can assume values larger than unity reflects a manifestation of the inadequacy of lrt to describe the system dynamics for the parameter values considered .    to rationalize this anomalous sr - gain behavior",
    ", we notice that the role of the noise in the dynamics is twofold . on the one hand",
    ", it controls the decay time of @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the noise value is relevant to ellucidate whether the one - time probability distribution is basically monomodal or bimodal during most of the cycle and , consequently , it controls the initial value @xmath78 . as discussed above ,",
    "if @xmath4 is small , the decay time is very large compared to @xmath1 , and the one - time probability distribution is essentially bimodal . for large values of @xmath4 , the decay of @xmath44 is fast enough , and the distribution is also bimodal .",
    "the large sr - gain obtained here requires the existence of a range of intermediate noise values such that : i ) @xmath44 decays in a much shorter time scale than @xmath1 and , ii ) the one - time probability distribution remains monomodal during most of the external cycle .",
    "as mentioned before , there are several time scales which are important for the phenomenon of stochastic amplification and gain . in the previous subsection",
    "we have considered an input frequency small enough so that the inequality @xmath88 holds for a range of noise values .",
    "next , we shall analyze the system response to a driving force with fundamental frequency @xmath87 , ten times larger than in the previous case .",
    "we will take the same input amplitude as in the previous case , @xmath62 , which is still subthreshold . for this input frequency ,",
    "the threshold value for the amplitude strength is determined by numerically solving the deterministic equation to yield @xmath89 .",
    "the behavior of the first two cumulants for several values of the noise strength is depicted in fig .",
    "[ wp11 ] [ from top to bottom @xmath66 ( panel a ) , @xmath67 ( panel b ) , @xmath68 ( panel c ) , @xmath69 ( panel d ) and @xmath70 ( panel e ) ] . for all values of @xmath4 ,",
    "the second cumulant remains large for most of each half - period .",
    "by contrast with the lower frequency case , we detect no values of @xmath4 for which the probability distribution is monomodal for a significant fraction of each half period .    in fig .",

    "the amplitude of the coherent oscillations shows a nonmonotonic behavior with @xmath4 .",
    "the incoherent part has initial values which remain very large in comparison with the corresponding ones for @xmath61 ( compare with fig .",
    "[ wp2 ] ) , consistently with the large value of the second cumulant .",
    "the decay times are roughly the same for both frequencies .    in fig .",
    "[ wp33 ] we show the behavior of the several sr quantifiers as a function of @xmath4 . the comparison of figs .",
    "[ wp3 ] and [ wp33 ] indicates that @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath82 have the same qualitative behavior for both frequencies .",
    "the non - monotonic dependence on @xmath4 of @xmath81 and @xmath82 are indicative of the existence of sr ( for both frequencies ) for the subthreshold input amplitude and in the ranges of @xmath4 values considered .",
    "the most relevant quantitative difference is that for @xmath87 the sr - gain remains less than unity .",
    "with this work , we have analyzed the phenomenon of sr within the context of a noisy , bistable symmetric system driven by time periodic , rectangular forcing possessing a duty cycle of unity .",
    "the numerical solution of the langevin equation allows us to analyze the long - time behavior of the average , the second cumulant and the coherent and incoherent parts of the correlation function . for subthreshold input signals we determined the snr , together with its",

    "this finding is at variance with the recent claim in refs .",
    "@xcite that pulse - like signals with small duty cycles are needed to obtain sr - gains larger than unity .",

    "<S> the main objective of this work is to explore aspects of stochastic resonance ( sr ) in noisy bistable , symmetric systems driven by subthreshold periodic rectangular external signals possessing a _ large _ duty cycle of unity . using a precise numerical solution of the langevin equation </S>",
    "<S> , we carry out a detailed analysis of the behavior of the first two cumulant averages , the correlation function and its coherent and incoherent parts . </S>",
    "<S> we also depict the non - monotonic behavior versus the noise strength of several sr quantifiers such as the average output amplitude , i.e. the spectral amplification ( spa ) , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the sr - gain . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we find that with _ </S>",
    "<S> subthreshold _ amplitudes and for an appropriate duration of the pulses of the driving force the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) , is accompanied by sr - gains exceeding unity . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis thus sheds new light onto the interplay between nonlinearity and the nonlinear response which in turn yields nontrivial , unexpected sr - gains above unity . </S>"
