    "in the study of the topology of a given 3manifold , @xmath5 , it has been useful to consider regular real - valued morse functions @xmath6 where  @xmath5 has some smooth structure .",
    "a regular real - valued morse function on @xmath5 corresponds to a handle decomposition of @xmath5 of the form @xmath7 where  @xmath8 is a collection of 0-handles , @xmath9 is a collection of 1handles , @xmath10 is a collection of 2handles , and @xmath11 is a collection of 3handles , in such a way that the @xmath12handles of the decomposition are neighbourhoods of the critical points of index @xmath12 of the morse function ( @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) . in a celebrated paper ( @xcite ) , it is introduced the concept of _ thin position _ for 3manifolds ; the idea is to build the manifold as described above ( that is , step by step : adding to the set @xmath8 the set @xmath15 , and then adding @xmath16 , and then adding @xmath17 , and so on ) with a sequence of selected sets of 1handles and sets of 2handles chosen to keep the boundaries of the intermediate steps as simple as possible .",
    "now if a 3manifold @xmath5 satisfies @xmath18 , then there are essential ( non - nulhomotopic ) regular morse functions @xmath19 , and one can always find this kind of functions having only critical points of index  1 and  2 ( see section  [ sec22 ] ) .",
    "such a function corresponds to a _",
    "circular handle decomposition _",
    "@xmath20 \\cup b_1 \\cup p_1",
    "\\cup\\cdots \\cup b_r \\cup p_r $ ] where @xmath21 is a properly embedded surface in @xmath5 , @xmath9 is a collection of 1handles , and @xmath10 is a collection of 2handles ( the handles are glued along , say ,  @xmath22 ) , and , as above , the set of @xmath12handles of the decomposition corresponds to the critical points of index @xmath12 of the morse function . with",
    "this kind of circular handle decompositions we may also require that the intermediate steps be as simple as possible : that requirement acquires the notion of thin position for circular handle decompositions .",
    "the existence of these decompositions gives rise to numerical topological invariants such as the ( circular ) handle number , @xmath23 where the sum @xmath24 is minimal among all circular handle decompositions ; also , when the decomposition is in thin position , we obtain the circular width , @xmath25 ( see section  [ sec24 ] ) .",
    "outstanding examples of manifolds that admit circular handle decompositions , are the exteriors of links in @xmath26 . in this case",
    "the interesting intermediate surfaces in the decomposition are seifert surfaces for the given link ( these intermediate surfaces have no closed components , and , if the decomposition is in thin position , they are a sequence of seifert surfaces which are alternately incompressible and weakly incompressible .",
    "see @xcite , theorem  3.2 , where there is a statement for knots , but its proof works verbatim for links ) .",
    "if the exterior of a link @xmath27 in @xmath26 admits a circular decomposition of the form  @xmath28 \\cup b_1 \\cup p_1 $ ] , and this decomposition is in thin position , we say that @xmath27 is an _ almost fibered link_. one may regard the set of almost fibered knots as the set of knots with non - trivial simplest circular handle structure .",
    "thus , an interesting problem of this theory is : determine the set of all almost fibered knots .",
    "we solve this problem for the family of free genus one knots .",
    "in fact we show that all free genus one knots are almost fibered ( theorem  [ thm67 ] ) .",
    "also it is interesting to find explicit constructions of circular handle decompositions of the exterior of a given link which are minimal ( that is , that realize the handle number ) , or that are in thin position . in @xcite , although in other context , explicit minimal circular handle decompositions of the exterior of the 250 knots in rolfsen s table are given . of these knots ,",
    "117 are fibered , and 132 have handle number one .",
    "as far as we know , there are no other previously published explicit constructions of circular handle decompositions of exteriors of links in the 3sphere .",
    "as mentioned above , in this paper we are interested mainly in the circular handle structures of the family of free genus one knots :    in the first part of this work ( section  [ sec3 ] ) we develop techniques to construct explicit circular decompositions of link exteriors for links that admit a free seifert surface ; these decompositions are interesting , of course , when the free seifert surface used in the construction is of minimal genus for the link .",
    "the information needed to construct these decompositions for the exterior of a given link is encoded in some spine of a free seifert surface of the link . in this sense , the techniques developed in section  [ sec3 ] ( and through all this paper ) could be regarded as elements for a possible theory of spines of surfaces on handlebodies that might be worthy of consideration . as applications we construct minimal circular decompositions for all rational knots and links and , also , for a family of pretzel knots , namely , pretzel knots of the form  @xmath29 with @xmath30 odd integers @xmath31 .",
    "these circular decompositions for both families of links are all minimal and have handle number  one ; they are also in thin position , giving also the circular width of each link considered .",
    "this last family gives examples of non - fibered knots whose handle number is strictly less than their tunnel number ( remark  [ remark311 ] ) .",
    "also , it is shown that free genus one knots have handle number @xmath32 ( corollary  [ coro36 ] ) .",
    "secondly ( section  [ sec4 ] ) , we construct circular handle decompositions for the exteriors of all pretzel knots of the form @xmath33 with @xmath34 odd integers @xmath35 , and we show that these decompositions are minimal with handle number two ( theorem  [ thm41 ] ) , and are also in thin position , giving the circular width equal to 6 for each of these knots .",
    "these examples answer a question posed in @xcite ( remark  [ remark45 ] ) .",
    "next , in section  [ sec5 ] , we give a characterization of the free genus one knots that admit at least two different ( non - parallel ) seifert surfaces of genus one .",
    "this characterization is given in terms of the existence of a special spine for the given genus one free seifert surface of the knot ( see theorem  [ thm52 ] ) .",
    "using the characterization given in section  [ sec5 ] we show , in the final part of this work , that all ( non - fibered ) free genus one knots are almost fibered ( theorem  [ thm67 ] ) .",
    "it follows from the proof of theorem  [ thm67 ] , that the free genus one knots with handle number two have a unique minimal genus seifert surface ( that is , free genus one knots with at least two genus one seifert surfaces have handle number one ) .",
    "it is an interesting open problem to determine the family of free genus one knots with handle number two .",
    "unless explicitly stated , we will use the word ` knot ' for a knot or a link in @xmath26 .",
    "that is , we will emphasize connectedness if needed .",
    "otherwise , we will admit non - connected knots .",
