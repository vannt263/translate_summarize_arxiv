    "the well - studied nearby ( z=0.0177 ) misaligned agn 3c84 is a unique source because unlike many other similar sources , it is detected at @xmath0-ray energies and it is thought that we are directly observing the jet launching region @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest unresolved questions in agn studies is the site of @xmath0-ray emission in jets .",
    "@xmath0-rays are thought to be produced by the up - scattering of lower energy photons that are either seeded internally to the jet ( e.g. @xcite ) or externally perhaps in the broad line region ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "evidence has been conflicting , although with most evidence in blazars suggesting the internal mechanism , occurring downstream of the central smbh ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the study is to use simultaneous multi - frequency vlbi observations to determine the location of @xmath0-ray flaring .",
    "observations were conducted approximately monthly from january 16 2013 until march 1 2016 at 22ghz ( 14 mm ) , 43ghz ( 7 mm ) , 86ghz ( 3 mm ) and 129ghz ( 2 mm ) on the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) .",
    "data were observed as part of the imogaba program @xcite and data were reduced using the kvn pipeline @xcite , which is referred to for more details . in total , 32 epochs were observed , with five epochs lost due to technical or weather issues .",
    "data in the @xmath0-ray bands were obtained from the fermi - lat spacecraft and binned monthly .",
    "details of @xmath0-ray data reduction are in the paper that is being prepared , but similar procedures can be found in @xcite .",
    "recent vlbi maps show that the source has two main bright components , the northernmost labelled c1 and the southernmost labelled c3 . setting c1 as a reference",
    ", we find motion detected at all observing frequencies except 2 mm , consistent with previous published results @xcite .",
    "[ lcs ] -ray flux density ( photons/@xmath1/s).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=140.0% ]    in order to determine the relative changes in flux densities consistently across the frequency ( and hence resolution ) range , the maps were model - fitted using a fixed gaussian with a full - width - half - maximum of 0.8mas and with only two components .",
    "while this may affect the absolute accuracy of the flux densities measured , it should improve the relative accuracy .",
    "the light - curves from the source are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the top panel shows the light curves at each frequency for the total ( c1+c3 ) flux density .",
    "the next panel below shows the c1 decomposed light - curve and the panel below that shows the c3 decomposed light - curve .",
    "the next panel shows how the 3 mm  2 mm spectral index in c1 changes with time and the bottom panel shows the monthly binned @xmath0-ray flux densities .",
    "we see that the the spectral index appears to be anti - correlated with the @xmath0-ray light - curve .",
    "however , there also appears to be an increasing trend in the @xmath0-ray flux density that is best reflected with the trend in c3 .",
    "the spectrum of c1 is highly variable between 3 mm and 2 mm , while the spectral shape of c3 is quite consistent across all epochs .",
    "the relatively rapid @xmath0-ray flaring appears to be correlated with the mm - wave flaring in c1 .",
    "since c1 is considered likely to be at or near the location of the central smbh , this places that site of @xmath0-ray flaring much closer to the central engine than many other studies have found , where they place the site many parsecs downstream ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "emission found downstream is normally interpreted as due to the seed photons for @xmath0-ray production originating within the jet .",
    "the flaring in c3 could be consistent with this interpretation , but the emission from c1 suggests that the seed photons could potentially originate in the blr .",
    "this therefore suggests that both mechanisms may be responsible for @xmath0-ray emission , even in the same source .",
    "we find evidence for @xmath0-ray flaring to be occurring in multiple locations within 3c84 at the same time .",
    "short time - scale flaring appears to be correlated with mm - wave flaring in the core region , near the smbh .",
    "longer time - scale @xmath0-ray emission appears to be associated with a travelling shock several parsecs downstream of the smbh .",
    "we interpret these results as likely being evidence of multiple @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms being present within 3c84 .",
