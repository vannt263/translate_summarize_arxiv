    "observed relationships in galaxies between central black hole mass and stellar mass ( e.g. magorrian et al . 1998 ) , velocity dispersion ( i.e. the @xmath4-@xmath5 relation ; e.g. gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , or galaxy structural properties ( e.g. the black hole fundamental plane : hopkins et al . 2007a ,",
    "b ) indicate a co - eval nature in supermassive black hole growth and star formation in galaxies .",
    "these results have prompted a number of investigations in recent years to quantify this apparent self - regulation in star formation and black hole growth in galaxies , and their relationship to the formation and evolutionary history of the host system ( e.g. kauffmann & haehnelt , 2000 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2006a , b ; 2007c , d ) .    over the last two decades , observations of local galaxies have painted a compelling picture in which galaxy mergers provide the link between massive starbursts and central black hole growth and activity .",
    "ulirgs ( ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) , for example , are a class of starburst galaxies with elevated infrared luminosities ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 ) which typically show signs of interactions ( e.g. downes & solomon , 1998 ; sanders et al .",
    "1988a ; scoville et al .",
    "2000 ) . while the intense infrared luminosity in these sources certainly owes in large part to the merger induced starbursts ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988a , b ; sanders & mirabel , 1996 ) , in some cases a contribution from a buried active galactic nucleus ( agn ) may be non - negligible .",
    "for example , many ulirgs show spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , infrared color ratios ( e.g. f[25/60@xmath8 m ] ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission ( pah ) deficits , and emission line fluxes ( e.g. [ ne v ] at 14.3@xmath8 m ) consistent with central agn activity ( e.g. armus et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; farrah et al . 2003 ; de grijp et al .",
    "indeed , 35 - 50% of ulirgs with luminosity above of 10@xmath9 show optical and nir spectra consistent with agn activity ( kim , veilleux & sanders , 2002 ; tran et al .",
    "2001 ; veilleux , kim & sanders , 1998 ) .",
    "these results suggest that these merging systems are simultaneously undergoing a massive star formation and central black hole growth phase",
    ".    observed similarities such as these between starburst galaxies , ulirgs and quasars prompted soifer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and sanders et al .",
    "( 1988a , b ) to propose an empirically derived evolutionary sequence which connects galactic starbursts to quasars through galaxy mergers . in this picture , the fueling of the central black hole and agn growth phase is realized during the major merger when gaseous inflows trigger nuclear starbursts as well as central black hole growth .",
    "the dusty galaxy transitions from a cold , starburst dominated ulirg , to a warm , agn - dominated ulirg ( where cold and warm refer to f[25/60@xmath8 m ] ratios ) , and , as supernovae and stellar winds clear the obscuring gas and dust , to an optical quasar . in this sense , galaxy mergers provide a unique laboratory for studying the possible co - evolution of starbursts , black hole growth and activity , and spheroid formation .",
    "recent models have provided a theoretical foundation and further evidence for a merger - driven starburst - agn connection in galaxies .",
    "specifically , simulations by springel , di matteo & hernquist ( 2005a ) have shown that galaxy mergers can fuel large - scale gaseous inflows ( e.g. barnes & hernquist , 1991 , 1996 ) which trigger nuclear starbursts ( mihos & hernquist , 1996 ; springel et al .",
    "2005a ) as well as promote central black hole growth ( di matteo , springel & hernquist , 2005 ) .",
    "subsequent winds associated with the growth of central black holes can lift the veil of obscuring gas and dust , and along several sightlines produce a quasar with comparable lifetimes , luminosity functions , and observed @xmath10-band and x - ray properties to those observed ( cox et al .",
    ", 2006b ; hopkins et al .",
    "2005a - d ; 2006a - d ) .",
    "the merger remnants quickly redden owing to gas depletion and the impact of feedback from star formation and black hole growth ( e.g. springel et al .",
    "2005b ) and resemble elliptical galaxies in their kinematic and structural properties .",
    "indeed , the population of stars formed during the starbursts accounts for the central `` excess light '' seen in ongoing mergers ( e.g. rothberg & joseph 2004 , 2006 ) and provides a detailed explanation for the luminosity profiles of old ellipticals ( e.g. kormendy et al . 2007 ; see mihos & hernquist 1994a ; hopkins et al .",
    "2007e , f , g ) .",
    "a consensus picture has thus been borne out from these observations and simulations over the last two decades in which so called feedback processes associated with winds from star formation and black holes act to self - regulate the growth of both the stellar and black hole masses in galaxies ( e.g. fabian , 1999 ; silk & rees , 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , the effects of starburst and agn feedback - driven winds have been observed in local galaxies ( e.g. heckman et al .",
    "2000 ; martin , 2005 ; rupke , veilleux & sanders , 2005a - c ; rupke & veilleux , 2005 ; tremonti , moustakas & diamond - stanic , 2007 ) , as well as those at high-  ( e.g. narayanan et al . 2004 ; pettini et al . 2002 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) by way of absorption line outflows .",
    "however , the direct effect of feedback processes ( especially from the highly efficient central agn ) on the emission properties of galaxies is not yet well characterized ( see veilleux , cecil & bland - hawthorn , 2005 for an extensive review and associated references ) . in this sense , it is important to relate theories of galaxy formation and evolution which incorporate physically motivated models of feedback processes to observational signatures of winds across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "in particular , observations of molecular gas in galaxies have proven valuable in characterizing the physics related to nuclear star formation and central agn fueling in galaxy mergers as the molecular gas serves as fuel both for star formation as well as the central black hole(s ) .",
    "for example , interferometric observations of molecular gas in ulirgs show that most typically harbor @xmath010@xmath11of molecular gas within the central 1.5 kpc ( scoville et al .",
    "1986 ; bryant & scoville , 1999 )",
    ". moreover , high resolution maps of dense molecular gas at submillimeter wavelengths in ulirgs have revealed kinematic structures of double nuclei in mergers ( scoville , yun & bryant , 1997 ) , bar - driven inflows ( sakamoto et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the density structure of gas fueling the central agn ( iono et al . 2004 ) .    with the increased spatial resolution and sensitivity afforded by the latest generation of ( sub)mm - wave interferometers ( e.g. the sma , carma , pdbi ) ,",
    "a number of recent observations have been able to pioneer investigations as to the effects of galactic winds on molecular gas emission in galaxies ( e.g. iono et al .",
    "2007 ; sakamoto , ho & peck , 2006 ; walter , wei  & scoville , 2002 ) .",
    "detections such as these are expected to become more routine in upcoming years as the alma interferometer becomes available .",
    "an important complement to these current and forthcoming observations of molecular line emission from starburst galaxies and agn are physical models which directly relate co emission properties to galactic scale winds .    in this context",
    ", it is our aim to investigate the role that galactic winds can play on co emission properties from starburst galaxies and agn via numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , we focus on specific signatures of winds imprinted on co morphologies and emission line profiles . in this work ,",

    "simulating molecular line emission on galaxy - wide scales has a relatively short history owing to the computational costs associated with the hydrodynamics and radiative transfer .",
    "early works by silk & spaans ( 1997 ) and combes , maoli & omont ( 1999 ) focused on simulating molecular emission from high-  objects , using idealized galaxy systems .",
    "wada & tomisaka ( 2005 ) pioneered incorporating three - dimensional non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) radiative transfer calculations into hydrodynamic simulations of agn , focusing specifically on predicted emission from the circumnuclear molecular torus .",
    "more recent works have folded non - lte radiative transfer codes into self - consistent hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers .",
    "these works have been performed in mergers scaled for low redshift ( narayanan et al .",
    "2006a ) , as well as those appropriate for higher-  systems ( greve & sommer - larsen , 2006 ; narayanan et al . 2007 ) .",
    "here , we employ a similar methodology to that of narayanan et al .",
    "( 2006a , 2007 ) . in this section",
    ", we describe our methods for incorporating 3d non - lte molecular line radiative transfer calculations into hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers which account for a multi - phase ism , star formation , growing black holes , and the effects of winds associated with star formation and central agn .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations used for this study employed a modified version of the publicly available @xmath16-body / sph code , gadget-2 ( springel , 2005 ) , adopting the fully conservative formulation of sph developed by springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) .",
    "the methods used to construct the progenitor galaxies , as well as a detailed description of the algorithms used to simulate the physics of feedback from star formation and accreting black holes is detailed in springel , di matteo & hernquist ( 2005a ) , and we direct the reader toward this work for further information . here , we briefly summarize these methods , and describe the specifics of the modeling most pertinent to this work .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is modeled as a multi - phase medium in which pressure feedback from supernovae heating is treated through an effective equation of state ( eos ) ( springel , di matteo & hernquist , 2005a ) .",
    "the disk galaxies used as progenitors in these simulations employed a softened eos with softening parameter @xmath17=0.25 ( see figure 4 of springel et al .",
    "the ism is modeled to include cold , dense gas surrounded by a hot ism , and is realized numerically through `` hybrid '' sph particles ( springel & hernquist , 2003 ) . in this formulation",
    ", cold ism is allowed to grow through radiative cooling of the hot ism , and conversely feedback associated with star formation can evaporate cold clouds into diffuse , hot gas .",
    "star formation follows the prescription of springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) and is constrained to fit the schmidt / kennicutt observed star formation laws ( kennicutt , 1998a , b ; schmidt , 1959 ) .    in order to explore the effects of galactic winds on the molecular ism",
    ", we include a formulation for both accreting black holes , and winds associated with massive starbursts . in our sph formalism , the black holes are included as sink particles which accrete gas from the surrounding ism .",
    "the accretion is treated with a bondi - lyttleton - hoyle parametrization ( bondi & hoyle , 1944 , hoyle & lyttleton , 1939 ) with a fixed maximum rate corresponding to the eddington limit .",
    "the black hole radiates such that its bolometric luminosity is given by @xmath18=@xmath19 with accretion efficiency @xmath20=0.1 .",
    "we further assume that 5% of this energy couples to the surrounding ism such that 0.5% of the accreted mass energy in our simulations is reinjected isotropically into the ism as thermal energy ( a parameter choice which allows the merged galaxy to reproduce the local @xmath4-@xmath5 normalization [ di matteo , springel & hernquist , 2005 ] ) .",
    "hence , the black hole energy deposition rate into the ism may be expressed as    @xmath21    where @xmath22=0.005 ( cox et al . 2007 ; springel , di matteo & hernquist . , 2005a ) .",
    "starburst winds are treated utilizing the constant wind models of springel & hernquist ( 2003 ) . in this formulation , the mass loss rate ( denoted by @xmath23 )",
    "is assumed to be proportional to the star formation rate ( denoted by @xmath24 ) , such that : @xmath25 where @xmath26 quantifies the wind mass loading factor .",
    "the wind is assumed to have a speed constrained by a fraction of the supernova energy ( @xmath27 ) : @xmath28 in a recent study of galactic winds in galaxy mergers , cox et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found that winds with high mass loading factors ( @xmath291 ) may be unphysical in that they tend to prevent any starburst after the major merger .",
    "we thus choose a moderate mass loading factor of @xmath26=0.5 , and constant wind velocity @xmath30=837 for this study .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the favored momentum - driven wind scalings for the galaxy masses we simulate found by oppenheimer & dav ( 2006 ) . for more details concerning constraints on wind velocities and efficiencies in galactic scale simulations , we refer the reader to cox et al .",

    "the progenitor galaxies in our models contain a dark matter halo initialized with a hernquist ( 1990 ) profile , concentration index @xmath36=9 , spin parameter @xmath37=0.033 , circular velocity @xmath38=160 , and are bulge - less .",
    "the galaxy s exponential disk is rotationally supported and comprises 4.1% of the total mass .",

    "the excitation of molecular gas is highly sensitive to both variations in the temperature and density distribution , as well as the incident radiation field .",
    "there are usually large differences in the collisional densities necessary to excite different energy levels .",
    "for example , in the case of co , the critical density to collisionally populate the j=1 state is @xmath4010@xmath41 - 10@xmath42 @xmath43 while the j=3 state typically requires @xmath4410@xmath45 @xmath43 .",
    "the latter density is characteristic of dense cores in gmcs , whereas the former is typical of diffuse gmc atmospheres .",
    "the non - lte radiative transfer calculations for this work were calculated during post - processing of the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the spatial range considered for the radiative transfer was 12 kpc .",
    "the simulation outputs were smoothed to a resolution of @xmath0250 pc in order to defray computational costs associated with the radiative transfer simulations . in order to model the strongly density - dependent excitation rates in our simulations ,",
    "we have expanded the bernes ( 1979 ) non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) monte carlo radiative transfer algorithm to include a mass spectrum of gmcs in a subgrid manner .",
    "the molecular gas fraction in galaxies is determined by the metallicity , dust content , interstellar radiation field , density and temperature ( hollenbach , werner & salpeter , 1971 ; pelupessy , papadopoulos & van der werf , 2006 ) . however , owing to limited spatial resolution , this calculation can not be done explicitly as the location of individual stars and clouds are not know .",
    "we therefore assume that half of the cold neutral gas mass in each grid cell is in atomic form and half in molecular , as motivated by local volume surveys of star forming galaxies ( e.g. keres , yun & young 2003 ) though note that an estimate of the molecular fraction can be obtained via sub - grid prescriptions ( e.g. pelupessy et al . 2006 ; greve & sommer - larsen 2006 ; robertson & kravtsov 2007 ) .    in our formulation , the cold molecular gas is assumed to be exist in a mass spectrum of gmcs in each grid cell @xmath46 where we take @xmath47=1.8 ( blitz et al .",

    "we therefore focus our modeling efforts for this work on the predicted co emission properties of galaxy mergers in the context of galactic winds , and defer investigations of emission from other molecules to future work .",
    "this methodology has the distinct advantages of being able to simulate the effects of dense cores as well as diffuse atmospheres of clouds .",
    "because we divide the gmcs into a series of sub - grid cells , we are not constrained to using a single density in our rate equations , and thus the collisional excitation characteristic of dense cores can be well - represented while the influence of radiation on more diffuse regions can likewise be accounted for .",
    "moreover , we are able to include these features in our calculations without expanding the grid to computationally prohibitive sizes .",
    "our subgrid formulation is dependent on a series of assumptions as well .",
    "first , owing to limited spatial resolution , we are forced to assume a constant  gas fraction constrained by observational surveys .",
    "this molecular gas in a given grid cell is assumed to be all in gmcs .",
    "the gmcs are realized as power - law spheres in our model whereas clouds are understood observationally to be fractal in nature ( e.g. elmegreen & falgarone , 1996 ) .",
    "the clouds within each grid cell are all at the same temperature , and individually isothermal ( though temperatures are allowed to vary from grid cell to grid cell , and thus temperature gradients exist across the galaxy ) .",
    "the temperatures in the cold phase of the ism in the hydrodynamic models are fixed at 1000k ( springel & hernquist , 2003 ) .",
    "this choice is arbitrary and has no effect on the hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "typically , temperatures in molecular clouds range from 10 - 100k ; temperatures of 1000k would systematically put too much weight on the collisional coefficients in the rate equations , resulting in overly excited level populations . while it is indeed tractable to run galaxy - wide hydrodynamic models which allow the temperatures to cool to lower values than those set here ( e.g. robertson & kravtsov 2007 ) , it is computationally infeasible for the large numbers of simulations presented in this work ( table  [ table : ics ] ) .",
    "thus , a subgrid model for refining the temperature structure of the ism is required .",
    "we construct a relatively simple model for the ism temperature structure by considering the dominant heating mechanism for the gas as heating from o and b stars ( assuming a salpeter imf ) .",
    "we sample individual grid cells on a finer ( 512@xmath42 ) resolution and place o and b stars formed in the hydrodynamic simulations in the power - law sphere clouds randomly throughout the higher resolution grid cells .",

    "thus , higher lying co lines ( e.g. co j=3 - 2 ) from the merger broadly follow the distribution of the co ( j=1 - 0 ) line , but remain more compact in nature , generally emitting only from the dense starbursting nucleus .",

    "the relative weakness of starburst - driven outflows compared to the agn only model is a direct consequence of the lower peak energy input from the starburst - driven winds , and hence lower power . during the active phase , the feedback from black holes inputs more than five times the energy as that imparted by star formation .",

    "this gas does eventually rain into the nuclear potential , fueling black hole growth and producing a black hole with the same mass as in the agn wind only model ( bh ) and a galaxy that lies on the m@xmath102-@xmath103 line ( cox et al .",

    "the fraction of time in our simulations outflows are visible is dramatically increased as well in this merger model . in the sb / sbbh / bh models ,",

    "the predicted lack of extended co ( j=1 - 0 ) emission in galaxy mergers with winds is consistent with observations . in a high resolution",

    "moreover , high resolution observations and radiative transfer modeling of local mergers have confirmed the compact nature of co emission in mergers ( downes & solomon , 1998 ) .",
    "winds associated with growing black holes and/or starbursts may help to explain this .    in the models with winds ,",
    "as the galaxies merge , the sudden inflow of gas into the nucleus rapidly drives up the nuclear star formation rate , as well as the accretion rate of the black hole(s ) .",
    "the feedback associated with star formation and the central agn is effective at heating the gas in the nuclear regions , and dispersing lower density co ( j=1 - 0 ) gas , leaving behind only a dense core of cool gas in the central regions in the winds models .",
    "the average co ( j=1 - 0 ) half light radius after the nuclei have coalesced for the models with sne and/or agn is @xmath0700 pc .",
    "this was also seen in figure  [ figure : sb10bh_morph ] where we showed that the major co ( j=1 - 0 ) intensity for the model with sne and agn winds originates in a compact region , in agreement with observations of local ulirgs ( bryant & scoville , 1999 ; downes & solomon , 1998 ) .    in principle",

    "[ figure : halflight ] we show the mean half light radius for each model plotted as a function of co transition . here",

    "the co emission in the model without winds becomes more compact in higher lying transitions ( e.g. those with higher critical densities ) . in the models with sne and/or agn winds",
    ", the co emission shows a similar behavior , but the halflight radius for the lowest transitions is about a factor of two smaller than in the models without winds .    with these predictions ,",
    "we caution that specific values quoted here are dependent on a number of assumptions included in parameter choices ( such as , for example , the specific multi - phase ism breakdown [ e.g. springel & hernquist , 2003 ] or constant co abundances ) , and thus the normalization of the plots presented are to be taken within those confines . however , the general trends are likely to be more robust . in this sense ,",
    "the relatively shallow slope in half - light radius versus transition ( figure  [ figure : halflight ] ) remains a valid observational test for the role of galactic winds in shaping observed co spatial extents .",
    "finally , it is important to note that the weak trend in average halflight radius as a function of transition in figure  [ figure : halflight ] is an ensemble - averaged trend over three orthogonal sightlines and numerous points in the post - coalescence evolution of the galaxies .",
    "thus , observations examining this relationship must select samples of galaxies after the progenitors have coalesced - in other words , after the merger has only a single nuclear emission peak in the co morphology .",
    "generically , when the nuclei of the progenitor galaxies are still resolvable , prior to coalescence , the unresolved co emission line exhibits multiple emission peaks corresponding to the nuclear regions of each galaxy ( e.g. greve & sommer - larsen , 2006 ) .",
    "when the molecular gas in galaxy mergers becomes dynamically relaxed , the co emission line is reasonably well represented by a single broad gaussian . alongside this general trend , at various times throughout the evolution of the merger , secondary ( and potentially , though less",
    "commonly , tertiary and quaternary ) peaks can be seen superposed on the broad co gaussian - like line . in figure",
    "[ figure : map_spectra ] , we show a representative evolution of co spectral lines , and how they correspond to the co morphology .",
    "these secondary peaks superposed on the broad gaussian originate in massive co gas clumps moving along the line of sight . in figure",
    "[ figure : map_spectra ] , the secondary peak in the third panel represents emission from the outflowing clump visible in the corresponding co contour image .    while these superposed secondary emission peaks are a general feature of all models in our simulations , the physical origin of these peaks is dependent on the strength of the winds included in a given merger model .",
    "in particular , secondary emission peaks with velocities greater than the circular velocity typically represent loosely bound gas which has not virialized ( peaks at velocities lower than the circular velocity may also be loosely bound gas , though they may also represent gas in rotational support ; for brevity we hereafter refer to secondary peaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity as high velocity peaks ) .",
    "as we will show more quantitatively , in models which include winds , this high velocity gas is typically entrained in outflow during periods of activity ( e.g. elevated star formation rate or black hole growth ) , and thus give rise to high velocity peaks in the emission line representative of outflowing gas .",
    "this is analogous to the situation seen in the co morphologies presented in figure  [ figure : outflows_differentmodels ] when loosely bound gas simply fell into the central potential in the model without winds , but was entrained in outflow in models with winds ( here , models sb , sbbh and bh ) .",
    "this effect of winds on co emission profiles was first shown explicitly in similar calculations by narayanan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "this work demonstrated that once the galaxies merged , large columns of gas outflowing along the line of sight can leave their imprint on the broad single - gaussian emission line characteristic of galactic co emission by introducing an additional superposed emission peak , red or blueshifted at the line of sight velocity of the outflow .",
    "the relative significance of high velocity peaks compared to the main emission line decreases as the gas virializes in the merger . to illustrate this , in figure  [ figure : chi ] we plot the evolution of the goodness of fit ( taken here as the median of the square of the residuals ) for a single gaussian fit to the emission lines from model bh , although the results are common across all models .",
    "the impact of winds in driving high velocity peaks decreases as the merger progresses .    in our models , high velocity peaks in co emission lines",
    "are typically representative of clumps of gas moving along the line of sight with masses @xmath905@xmath3310@xmath101 .",
    "gas clumps with masses much less than this are typically not able to emit strongly enough to be seen in the emission spectrum over the main gaussian . in the remainder of ",
    "[ section : lineprofiles ] , when we discuss clumps of outflowing and infalling gas , we will be referring to those above this minimum mass that are able to impact the emission line profile .    because high velocity peaks appear in our simulations even in spatially unresolved observations , they may be a powerful diagnostic for agn and starburst induced outflows both in the local universe and at earlier epochs .",
    "however , at this point in the discussion , there are open questions regarding the uniqueness of this line profile , as well as how these secondary peaks specifically relate to starburst and agn activity . in the remainder of this section , we attempt to quantify the use of molecular emission line profiles as a diagnostic for outflowing gas in galaxy mergers .",
    "emission lines representing gas with a strong line of sight velocity component can originate from either outflowing or infalling gas . as demonstrated by narayanan et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , agn feedback - driven molecular outflows can generate high velocity secondary peaks in the co emission lines when the outflow has a significant line of sight velocity component .",
    "any gas falling into the central potential with a negative radial velocity with respect to the center of mass of the system ( e.g gas that is in infall , or pre - coalescence mergers ) may also drive high velocity peaks in the co emission lines , and are thus degenerate with high velocity peaks that originate in outflows .",
    "it is therefore necessary to establish the uniqueness of high velocity peaks in co emission lines with respect to an actual outflow or infall origin .",
    "any attempt to break this degeneracy requires a more detailed knowledge of the physical properties and observational characteristics of the galaxy during periods when high velocity peaks are observable .    in order to assess how the evolutionary state of the galaxy merger may determine the origin of high velocity peaks ( i.e. whether they owe to outflowing or infalling gas )",
    ", we investigate the physical conditions during times when the galaxy exhibits high velocity peaks . to this end , we created synthetic co ( j=1 - 0 ) spectra along three orthogonal sightlines for the models in table  [ table : ics ] .",
    "these spectra were made by integrating over the entire co emitting area . to identify candidate emission lines with high velocity peaks driven by winds ( as opposed to rotation ) , we require the emission line to have a peak near the systemic velocity of the galaxy , and an additional peak with velocity greater than @xmath109160 .",
    "this fiducial requirement is set in place to filter out multiple emission peaks that arise from rotation as @xmath0160 is the circular velocity of the post - merger galaxy at the spatial extent of the  gas , and thus the maximum velocity of rotating gas .",
    "we consider all high velocity peaks whose peak intensity is at least 20% the peak line intensity .    upon identifying a line with a high velocity peak",
    ", we then determine whether the clump of gas generating the high velocity peak is outflowing or infalling . in order to simplify the analysis , in the few cases with multiple high velocity peaks , we focused on the peak with highest velocity . in figure",

    "figure  [ figure : vc3vc3e_2b_outflowinfall ] demonstrates that while the number of high velocity peaks is roughly constant after the major merger , the origin of these line profiles is a function of the evolutionary state of the galaxy . during phases of heavy black hole growth , the majority of the high velocity peaks owe to outflowing gas . towards the end of the quasar phase , when much of the blowout has already occurred , gas raining from outer parts of the galaxy give rise to multi - peaked profiles with an infall origin .",
    "conversely , similar analysis from the model without winds shows a more random origin for high velocity peaks in the emission profiles , reflecting the more randomly oriented velocity vectors of loosely bound clumps .",
    "this is explicitly shown in figure  [ figure : vc3vc3e_noc_outflowinfall ] , where we show the origin of high velocity peaks in a merger without winds compared with the bolometric and ir luminosity .",
    "another way of saying this is that the winds in model bh do not _ cause _ the high velocity peaks to exist in the co spectra .",
    "rather winds typically entrain the clumps of gas behind the high velocity peaks in outflow , thus giving physical significance to secondary peaks .",
    "this is not the case in the model with no winds , where the molecular gas representative of the high velocity peaks has random radial velocities with no preferred direction ( figure  [ figure : vc3vc3e_noc_outflowinfall ] ) . _",
    "high velocity peaks are seen in models both with and without winds ; in wind models , though , these peaks preferentially owe to outflowing gas during peaks of starburst activity and black hole growth . _",
    "observationally , many of the criteria that are used in creating samples of local galaxy mergers may select galaxies which are at the peak of their starburst or agn activity . high velocity peaks in the emission profiles ( e.g. higher than the circular velocity of the host ) observed in these galaxies may be likely , then , to owe to outflowing clumps of gas ( figure  [ figure : vc3vc3e_2b_outflowinfall ] ) .",
    "for example , the extreme bolometric and ir luminosities trace not only the prodigious star formation owing to the merger induced starburst , but also reflect a large contribution from the growing supermassive black hole .",
    "the winds associated with this black hole growth are behind much of the outflowing molecular gas during the most luminous phase of the galaxy s evolution .",
    "similarly , ir colors which select objects with embedded agn , such as the 25@xmath8m/60@xmath8 m flux ratio , may preferentially show objects which owe their outflow profile to outflows as opposed to infalling gas clumps . finally , the hard x - ray flux is dominated by the central agn , and thus traces the general growth of the central black hole .",
    "our models suggest that the phase during which the x - ray luminosity is at its greatest will be marked by high velocity peaks in the co emission originating in outflowing molecular gas .      a natural question is whether or not one can observationally infer the nature of high velocity peaks in co emission lines as discussed in ",
    "[ section : lineoverview ] .",

    "( 2002 ) found two ly@xmath51 and nv absorbers in ngc 985 at coincident velocities as those which co gas is seen projected against the nucleus .",
    "the data bring up the interesting speculative suggestion that perhaps the absorption line outflows seen in these systems are physically associated with the co emitting outflows .",
    "if so , it may be that the neutral and ionized outflows exist more toward the outer envelopes of the entrained complexes of molecular clouds as the conditions toward the central regions of these flows are extremely cold and dense ( @xmath010 - 30 k , @xmath010@xmath89 ; figure  [ figure : vc3vc3e_outflow ] ) .",
    "a full investigation into the potential relationship between uv and optical absorbers and co outflows is beyond the scope of this work , but studies into possible physical motivations for absorption line outflows within the context of these models are underway .    in principle , unresolved emission line profiles from galaxies are more easily obtainable in large numbers than the high - resolution maps necessary to directly image outflows .",
    "brief inspection by eye suggests that at least some local galaxies appear to espouse the high velocity peaks discussed in ",
    "[ section : lineprofiles ] ( e.g. narayanan et al . 2005 ; sanders scoville & soifer , 1991 ; solomon , downes & radford , 1992 ; yao et al .",
    "as previously discussed , robustly determining the physical mechanism driving high velocity peaks is difficult , although tests similar to figure  [ figure : vspike_noutflows ] may be possible with some prior knowledge of the host circular velocity .",
    "it is interesting to note that absorption line outflows , which have been attributed to starburst - driven winds , have been detected in many of the ulirgs in the aforementioned co samples ( martin , 2005 ; rupke et al .",
    "2005a - c ) .",
    "apparent high velocity peaks appear prodigiously in 2 submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ; greve et al .",
    "2005 ; tacconi et al . 2006 ; see blain et al .",
    ", 2002 and solomon & vanden bout 2006 for recent reviews ) .",
    "if the high velocity peaks in smgs owe to outflows , they may be explained by the prodigious star formation rates in these galaxies , in combination with a potential contribution from an embedded agn .",
    "for example , if the extreme luminosities owe solely to starbursts , then massive star formation rates of order @xmath01000 are typical of these sources ( e.g. blain et al .",
    "the relative role of agn energy input in smgs is a debated topic , as well as whether they are currently undergoing , or are soon to undergo a heavy black hole accretion phase ( e.g. alexander et al .",
    "2005a , b ; borys et al , 2005 ; chakrabarti et al .",
    "2007b ) . in either case ,",
    "powerful winds produced by the intense @xmath010@xmath42sfr and/or the central black hole could potentially drive high velocity peaks .",
    "that said , we caution against a direct application of these model results toward smgs .",
    "for one thing , the virial properties of the progenitor galaxies in these models have not been explicitly scaled for 2 ( robertson et al .",
    "2006a ) , and it is not clear how that will affect merger - induced star formation rates and black hole growth during the active period .",
    "moreover , it is not completely clear that smgs are the product of binary mergers as this work has focused on , and the kinematic profiles in these sources may be rather complex .",
    "models appropriate for 2 mergers ( e.g. chakrabarti et al . 2007b ; robertson et al .",
    "2006a ) will have to be studied in the context of galactic winds in order to asses the potential relationship between these results and smgs .",
    "we have combined 3d non - lte radiative transfer calculations with sph simulations of galaxy mergers in order to investigate the effects of galactic - scale winds on the molecular line emission in starburst galaxies and agn .",
    "we find that galactic winds are a natural result of merger - induced star formation and black hole growth .",
    "these winds can entrain molecular gas of order @xmath010@xmath1 - 10@xmath2 which imprints generic signatures in both the co morphology as well as unresolved emission line profiles .",
    "the specifics of the morphological and emission line indicators of molecular outflows depend on physical parameter choices within the galaxy merger models .",
    "in particular , the energy source ( i.e. bh accretion or star formation ) , as well as the merger orientation can vary the strength , direction , and duration of molecular outflows in emission contour maps , as well as the velocity separation of high velocity peaks in multi - component emission lines . many of the results including the halflight radius as a function of excitation , or the velocity offsets of high velocity peaks in the emission lines vary enough between physical parameter choices such that these models may be used to constrain physical origins for observed co morphologies and line profiles . in detail , we find the following :    1 .",
    "molecular outflows entrained in agn feedback and starburst - driven winds can be directly imageable via co emission line mapping .",
    "these types of outflows have been recorded in at least some local systems ( e.g. iono et al .",
    "these outflows will be detectable at cosmological distances given the predicted spatial resolution of alma .",
    "molecular outflows entrained in winds driven by agn feedback are typically longer lived than those entrained in starburst driven winds .",
    "this owes to the relative strength of agn feedback - driven winds versus starburst driven winds .",
    "winds from agn feedback in coplanar merger models are typically more powerful than mergers which occur at more random orientations .",
    "this results in outflows in these models being visible for the majority of the @xmath0200 myr active period studied here .",
    "the spatial extent of co emission can be controlled by the presence of galactic winds .",
    "the emission is seen to be stratified with transition in all models such that the co ( j=1 - 0 ) halflight radius is larger than the radius from higher lying transitions ( e.g. co j=7 - 6 ) , though the degree of stratification depends on the inclusion of winds .",
    "the relatively compact nature of observed co emission in local mergers ( r@xmath116 typically confined to the central kpc ; scoville & bryant , 1999 ) may be a consequence of agn feedback or starburst - driven winds .",
    "5 .   in all models , high velocity peaks ( peaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity ) can exist superposed on the post - merger galaxy s broad co emission line . in models without winds ,",
    "these peaks owe to random kinematics of molecular gas . in models with winds",
    ", these peaks are seen to originate primarily from gas entrained in outflow , at least during the period of peak black hole accretion / star formation .",
    "6 .   for the models studied here ( table  [ table : ics ] )",
    ", high velocity peaks driven by random kinematics do not typically appear at velocity offsets ( from systemic ) greater than @xmath01.7 times the circular velocity of the post - merger galaxy .",
    "in contrast , peaks entrained in agn feedback - powered winds can be driven to velocities near 2.5 times the circular velocity .",
    "the centroid velocities of the simulated lines are typically ( 1@xmath5 ) within @xmath020 of the true systemic velocity , and can generally be used as a reliable substitute for the systemic velocity in these models .",
    "thus the above results hold true when measuring the velocity offsets of high velocity peaks with respect to line centroids as well .",

    "<S> galactic winds from starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are thought to play an important role in driving galaxies along the starburst - agn sequence . here </S>",
    "<S> , we assess the impact of these winds on the co emission from galaxy mergers , and , in particular , search for signatures of starburst and agn - feedback driven winds in the simulated co morphologies and emission line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by combining a 3d non - lte molecular line radiative transfer code with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of galaxy mergers that include prescriptions for star formation , black hole growth , a multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) , and the winds associated with star formation and black hole growth . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are : ( 1 ) galactic winds can drive outflows of masses @xmath010@xmath1 - 10@xmath2which may be imaged via co emission line mapping . ( 2 ) agn feedback - driven winds are able to drive detectable co outflows for longer periods of time than starburst - driven winds owing to the greater amount of energy imparted to the ism by agn feedback compared to star formation . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) galactic winds can control the spatial extent of the co emission in post - merger galaxies , and may serve as a physical motivation for the sub - kiloparsec scale co emission radii observed in local advanced mergers . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) secondary emission peaks at velocities greater than the circular velocity are seen in the co emission lines in all models , regardless of the associated wind model . in models with winds , however , these high velocity peaks are seen to preferentially correspond to outflowing gas entrained in winds , which is not the case in the model without winds . </S>",
    "<S> the high velocity peaks seen in models without winds are typically confined to velocity offsets ( from the systemic ) @xmath31.7 times the circular velocity , whereas the models with agn feedback - driven winds can drive high velocity peaks to @xmath02.5 times the circular velocity . </S>"
