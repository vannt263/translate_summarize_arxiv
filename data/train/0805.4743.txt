    "quantum many - body systems of one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting particles have attracted an enormous interest for more than fifty years  @xcite .",
    "these systems are nowadays available in a large number of different laboratory realizations ranging from single - wall carbon nanotubes  @xcite to semiconductor nanowires  @xcite , conducting molecules  @xcite , chiral luttinger liquids at fractional quantum hall edges  @xcite , and trapped atomic gases  @xcite .",
    "regardless of statistics , the effective low - energy description of many of these systems is based on a harmonic theory of long - wavelength fluctuations  @xcite , _ i.e. _ on the  luttinger liquid \" model  @xcite .",
    "one distinctive feature of the luttinger liquid is that its low - energy spectrum is completely dominated by collective excitations as opposed to individual quasiparticles that carry both charge and spin .",
    "a single - particle excitation in a luttinger liquid directly decays into collective spin and charge excitations that propagate with different velocities .",
    "this phenomenon is called  spin - charge separation \"  @xcite .    tunneling measurements between two parallel quantum wires in gaas / algaas heterostructures with varying electron density have demonstrated  @xcite the existence of collective spin and charge excitations with different velocities .",
    "it has also been proposed to study experimentally the dynamics of spin and charge excitations _ in real time _ using 1d two - component cold fermi gases  @xcite , where  spin \" and  charge \" refer , respectively , to two internal ( hyperfine ) atomic states and to the atomic mass density  @xcite . in ref .",
    "a different aspect of this collective behavior has been pointed out : namely , spin excitations are intrinsically damped at finite temperature , while charge excitations are not .",
    "important for the experimental observation of the time - evolution of excitations in ultracold quantum gases is the creation of a sizable perturbation of the gas ( strong enough to be detected ) .",
    "the theoretical description of such strong perturbations , however , needs techniques going beyond the low - energy luttinger - liquid model  @xcite .",
    "for example , the decay of sizable density perturbations  @xcite and of a single - particle excitation  @xcite has been recently demonstrated in real time in a numerical time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group ( tdmrg )  @xcite study of the 1d fermi - hubbard model .",
    "aim of the present work is to provide a conceptually and numerically simple time - dependent microscopic many - body theory that is capable of capturing the main physical features of the time - evolution of collective excitations .    a powerful theoretical tool to study the interplay between interactions and time - dependent inhomogeneous external fields of arbitrary shape is the time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft )  @xcite , which is based on the runge - gross theorem  @xcite and on the time - dependent kohn - sham equations .",
    "many - body effects enter tddft _ via _ the time - dependent exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , which is often treated by the _",
    "adiabatic _ local - density approximation ( alda )  @xcite . in this approximation",
    "one assumes that the time - dependent xc potential is just the _ static _ xc potential evaluated at the instantaneous density .",
    "the static xc potential is then treated within the static lda .",
    "the main characteristic of the alda is that it is local in time , as well as in space .",
    "memory effects , whereby the xc potential at a time instant might depend on the density at an earlier time , are completely ignored .",
    "very attractive features of the alda are its extreme simplicity , the ease of implementation , and the fact that it is _ not _ restricted to small deviations from the ground - state density , _",
    "i.e. _ to the linear - response regime .    even though several non - adiabatic beyond - alda approximate functionals are available nowadays ( see _ e.g. _ refs .  ) , in this work we focus on a simple adiabatic xc functional and test its performance in describing a particular problem : collective density and spin dynamics in strongly correlated inhomogeneous lattice systems . building upon earlier ideas described at length in refs .",
    ", we here employ a lattice tddft scheme in which the time - dependent xc potential is determined _ exactly _ at the adiabatic local - spin - density - approximation level through the bethe-_ansatz _ solution of the homogeneous 1d hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "the numerical results based on this scheme are tested against accurate adaptive tdmrg simulation data for both spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized systems .",
    "the contents of the paper are briefly described as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sect : model ] we introduce the model lattice hamiltonian that we use to study collective excitations and we briefly summarize its exact solution in the absence of external potentials . in sect .",
    "[ sect : tsoft ] we present the self - consistent lattice tddft scheme that we use to deal with the time - dependent inhomogeneous system and introduce the bethe-_ansatz _ adiabatic local - spin - density approximation that we employ for the xc potential . in sect .",

    "[ sect : conclusions ] we summarize our main conclusions and future perspectives .",
    "we consider a two - component repulsive fermi gas with @xmath0 atoms confined to a 1d tube and subjected to an optical lattice potential applied in the direction of the tube .",
    "the optical lattice has unit lattice constant and @xmath1 lattice sites . for times",
    "@xmath2 the system is in the presence of a spin - selective focused laser - induced potential , which creates a strong local disturbance in the ultracold gas . at time @xmath3",
    "this local potential is _ suddenly _ turned off : we are interested in the subsequent time evolution of the spin - resolved densities .",
    "this system is modeled by the following fermi - hubbard hamiltonian  @xcite , @xmath4 in eq .",

    "we also introduce for future purposes the local number operator @xmath14 and the local spin operator @xmath15 .",
    "the  time - dependent \" hamiltonian @xmath16 models the aforementioned spin - selective focused laser - induced potential .",

    "this guarantees that the local potential @xmath20 , which is active for all times @xmath21 , is suddenly switched - off at time @xmath3 .",
    "note that the time @xmath22 enters the problem through the step function only .",
    "we are not really studying a time - dependent problem but only the dynamics of a system after a sudden local quench : an initial state @xmath23 , which is an eigenstate of @xmath24 , is propagated forward in time with a different hamiltonian ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "@xmath26 is the state of the system at time @xmath22 .",
    "present - day technology in cold - atom - gas laboratories allows to change the external potentials on short time scales . by this",
    "it is possible to explore the regime where the many - body system is still governed by a unitary evolution but with non - equilibrium initial conditions .",
    "the number of atoms with spin up , @xmath27 , can be different from the number of atoms with spin down , @xmath28 . the particle number @xmath29 and @xmath30 are separately conserved quantities because no spin - flip mechanism is included in the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) . the model ( [ eq : hubbard ] )",

    "obcs do not model well the most common experimental set - ups  @xcite in which a parabolic trapping acts on the fermi gas to keep it into the optical lattice .",
    "however , we have deliberately decided to limit our present investigations to simple obcs to disentangle spurious effects ( mainly spatial coexistence of different quantum phases ) that can be induced by the parabolic trapping from fundamental effects related to the dynamics after the quench .    in the absence of @xmath16 [ _",

    "charge \" @xmath79 and  spin \" local occupations @xmath80 are shown in the top left panel .",
    "the spin occupation is identically zero in this spin - unpolarized situation simply due to the symmetry between the @xmath81- and @xmath82-spin atoms .",

    "additional deviations from a homogeneous distribution are due to obcs which cause friedel oscillations .",
    "we find an excellent agreement between the ground - state dft / ba - lsda results ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : gs ] ) and the dmrg results .",
    "small differences between the two are visible only close to the boundaries and in the local perturbation .",
    "obcs are very severe boundary conditions for ba - lsda : the performance of this approximation increases in the presence of soft boundaries , such as those created by a parabolic trapping potential ",
    "see ref .  .",
    "our finding is in agreement with earlier studies  @xcite in which the inability of the ba local - density approximation to reproduce the correct friedel oscillations in the presence of a single impurity ( or close to a sharp boundary ) has been noted . in general",
    ", no local - density approximation for the xc potential is expected to produce friedel oscillations with an amplitude that scales as a power - law as a function of the distance from the impurity / boundary , with an exponent that is controlled by the interaction strength . of course , this inadequacy of ba - lsda is more severe at strong coupling : see , for example , the top left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] .",
    "the time evolution of charge and spin occupations subsequent to the sudden switching - off of the external local potential is illustrated in the other three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] for times @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for small times",
    "@xmath85 the initial dip in the charge density starts splitting into two counter - propagating perturbations .",
    "after the splitting the perturbations move with a certain velocity towards the boundaries . during the evolution a deformation of the shape of the density perturbations can be seen . scattering of the perturbation from the friedel oscillations and the boundaries occurs .",
    "we see how tddft / ba - alsda results are in full quantitative agreement with the tdmrg data .",
    "the agreement remains quite decent even at times later than @xmath86 , when reflections from the boundaries and interference with the microscopic friedel oscillations are expected to spoil the performance of tddft / ba - alsda .",

    "[ fig : three ] we show results for a spin - polarized system ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) .",
    "note that the local external potential in this case is again spin - independent ( as it was in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) and couples only to the total - charge sector . nonetheless , due to the imbalance between the number of atoms with different spin , this local disturbance generates a non - trivial spin dynamics .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the spin and charge sectors of the spin - polarized 1d hubbard model away from half - filling are coupled  @xcite .",
    "the coupling effects the dynamics considerably .",
    "in contrast to the spin - balanced case , the perturbation does not decay into noninteracting charge and spin perturbations .",
    "as before the charge - density perturbation evolves into two counterpropagating perturbations .",
    "however , the creation of a pronounced dip at the center of the system , which is due to the interaction with the slower spin perturbation , can be observed .",
    "we clearly see from fig .  [",
    "fig : three ] how the agreement between tddft / ba - alsda and tdmrg is also very satisfactory in this spin - polarized case .",
    "deviations are mainly observed close to the boundaries .",
    "all numerical results shown in figs .  [ fig : one]-[fig : three ] have been obtained for @xmath77 .",
    "we have also checked how the relative strength @xmath92 of interactions influences the reliability of tddft / ba - alsda . in figs .",
    "[ fig : four]-[fig : six ] we show results for spin - unpolarized and spin - polarized systems at @xmath93 and @xmath94 . with increasing coupling strength the deviations between the two methods increase both for the initial state and the time evolution . for the initial state",
    "the friedel oscillations are not captured correctly ( mainly the @xmath95 component  @xcite ) and large deviations at the boundaries arise . in particular , the results for the spin - density profiles at @xmath94 show considerable differences between the two methods . in the time evolution ,",
    "in contrast to smaller couplings , the form of the charge perturbation shows deviations between the results of the two methods even in the unpolarized case ( see the top right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] ) .",
    "however , the main features of the tdmrg data are qualitatively reproduced by tddft / ba - alsda ( _ e.g. _ the splitting into two counter - propagating perturbations with approximately the correct velocity ) . from these plots",
    "we can see how the predicting power of tddft / ba - alsda is quite acceptable also at strong coupling .",
    "in summary , we have carried out an extensive numerical study of the collective  spin \" and  charge \" dynamics in strongly correlated ultracold fermi gases confined in one - dimensional tight tube .",
    "we have compared the results obtained from time - dependent density - functional theory within a suitable ( bethe-_ansatz_-based ) adiabatic local - spin - density approximation with accurate results based on the adaptive time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group method .",
    "we have found the simple adiabatic local - spin - density approximation for the time - dependent exchange - correlation potential to be reliable and surprisingly accurate in describing the collective evolution of density and spin wave packets in a wide range of coupling strengths and spin polarizations .    the adiabatic scheme proposed in this work",
    "can also be used and tested in many other interesting problems .",
    "for example , one can study spin - charge dynamics after a local quench in luther - emery liquids [ which can be model by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) with @xmath96 , andreev reflection  @xcite in ultracold two - component fermi gases , and , of course , quantum dynamics in the presence of truly time - dependent external potentials .    in this last respect",
    ", we can anticipate that more sophisticated functionals in which the main alda assumptions , _",
    "i.e. _ ( i ) locality in space _ and _ time and ( ii ) the complete neglect of memory effects , have been relaxed may be needed to handle truly time - dependent problems .",
    "recent interesting numerical results  @xcite of a tddft study of small ( _ i.e. _ @xmath97 to @xmath98 ) hubbard chains seem indeed to indicate that _ both _",
    "( i ) and ( ii ) are ultimately necessary ingredients that the time - dependent xc potential of tddft should possess for the description of strongly correlated systems .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that adiabatic and beyond - adiabatic exchange - correlation functionals based on time - dependent current - spin - density - functional theory have also been recently applied  @xcite to study collective spin and charge dynamics at finite temperature in one - dimensional continuum models .",
