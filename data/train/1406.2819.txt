    "dendrimers are an important class of artificial macromolecules with a treelike structure , which are synthesized by repeating units in a hierarchical self - similar fashion around a central core  @xcite .",
    "their unique structural features make them promising candidates for a broad range of potential applications such as light harvesting antennae  @xcite and molecular amplifiers  @xcite , the latter of which can be used as efficient platforms for drug delivery  @xcite . in view of their practical significance ,",
    "thus far , dendrimers have received extensive attention within the scientific community  @xcite .    in the context of light harvesting by dendrimers , it is the large number of absorbing elements at the periphery and an efficient transfer of the absorbed energy to the center that make dendrimers work as antennas  @xcite .",
    "generally , light harvesting can be described as a trapping process with a ( fluorescent ) trap located at the center . a primary quantity related to trapping",
    "is average trapping time ( att ) , which is the average of mean first - passage time ( mfpt )  @xcite to the target over all starting nodes , where mfpt from a node to the trap is the expected time steps needed for a walker starting off from this node to visit the trap for the first time .",
    "att is a quantitative indicator measuring the trapping efficiency , which has been much studied for diverse complex systems  @xcite .",
    "_ _    because of the theoretical and practical relevance , trapping in dendrimers has also been devoted to concerted efforts .",
    "the problem was first addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the mfpt from a peripheral node to the central node was computed analytically . in refs .",
    "@xcite , mfpt from any node to the central node , as well as the att to the center , were deduced .",
    "these works unveiled the effect of structure on the mfpt and att to the central node . note that most previous works on trapping dendrimers based on discrete time random walks focused on the unbiased random walk .",
    "however , sometimes it is more suitable to describe some particular problems by a biased random walk than the unbiased one  @xcite , since the transition probability depends on not only network topologies but also other properties relevant to the diffusion dynamics  @xcite .    among numerous biased random walks ,",
    "maximal entropy random walk ( merw )  @xcite , maximizes the entropy of paths , has been studied recently  @xcite . in merw",
    ", the transition probability incorporates the node centrality measured by the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of adjacent matrix of the graph where the dynamical process takes place .",
    "this local transition rate leads to substantial effects on the diffusion behaviors such as stationary distribution  @xcite and relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "the principle of entropy maximization has found some applications , including optimal sampling algorithm  @xcite and demographic stability of population  @xcite .",
    "very recently , as a powerful tool , merw has been fruitfully applied in the analysis of complex networks  @xcite . at present , it is still of theoretical and practical interest to explore possible applications of merw on other areas .    in this paper , we study the trapping problem in cayley trees as models of dendrimers  @xcite , based on merw that incorporates the centrality of nodes of the macromolecular graphs .",
    "we concentrate on a particular case with a perfect trap placed at the central node , for which we derive an analytical exact expression for att .",
    "we then provide an upper bound for att , whose leading scaling behaves with the system size @xmath1 as @xmath2 , a scaling much smaller than that corresponding to unbiased random walk in cayley trees , for which the att scales linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "theses results show that for trapping process in dendrimers with a trap fixed at the center , merw is considerably more efficient in comparison to unbiased random walk .",
    "in this section , we introduce the construction and some relevant features of dendrimers modeled by cayley trees , which are built in an iterative way .",
    "the particular construction process allows for analytically determining the properties of cayley trees and deriving exact solutions for diverse dynamical processes on large but finite structures .",
