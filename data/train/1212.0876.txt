    "the problem of convergence to equilibrium for diffusion processes has attracted considerable attention in recent years .",
    "in addition to the relevance of this problem for the convergence to equilibrium of some systems in statistical physics , see for example  @xcite , such questions are also important in statistics , for example in the analysis of markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithms  @xcite . roughly speaking , one measure of efficiency of an mcmc algorithm",
    "is its rate of convergence to equilibrium , and increasing this rate is thus the aim of many numerical techniques ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall the basic approach for a reversible diffusion .",
    "suppose that we are interested in sampling from a probability distribution function @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a given smooth potential such that @xmath2 .",
    "a natural dynamics to use is the reversible dynamics @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a standard @xmath5-dimensional brownian motion .",
    "let us denote by @xmath6 the probability density function of the process @xmath7 at time  @xmath8 .",
    "it satisfies the fokker - planck equation @xmath9 under appropriate assumptions on the potential @xmath10 ( e.g. that @xmath11 as @xmath12 , see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a.19 ) ) , the density @xmath13 satisfies a poincar inequality : there exists @xmath14 such that for all probability density functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 the optimal parameter @xmath17 in   is the opposite of the smallest ( in absolute value ) non - zero eigenvalue of the fokker - planck operator @xmath18 , which is self - adjoint in @xmath19 ( see   below ) .",
    "thus , @xmath17 is also called the spectral gap of the fokker - planck operator .",
    "it is then standard to show that   is equivalent to the following inequality , which shows exponential convergence to the equilibrium for  : for all initial conditions @xmath20 , for all times @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the norm in @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 .",
    "this equivalence is a simple consequence of the following identity : if @xmath26 is solution to  , then @xmath27    in view of  , the algorithm is efficient if @xmath17 is large , which is typically not the case if @xmath28 is a metastable process ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "a natural question is therefore how to design a markovian dynamics which converges to equilibrium distribution @xmath13 ( much ) faster than  .",
    "there are many approaches ( importance sampling methods , constraining techniques , see for example  @xcite ) , and the focus here is on modifying the dynamics   to a non - reversible dynamics , which has the same invariant measure .",
    "as noticed in  @xcite , one way to accelerate the convergence to equilibrium is to depart from reversible dynamics ( see also  @xcite for related discussions for markov chains ) .",
    "let us recall that the dynamics   is reversible in the sense that if @xmath29 is distributed according to @xmath30 , then @xmath31 and @xmath32 have the same law .",
    "this is equivalent to the fact that the fokker - planck operator is self - adjoint in @xmath33 : @xmath34 now , a natural _ non - reversible _ dynamics to sample from the distribution @xmath35 is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is taken to be divergence - free with respect to the invariant distribution @xmath38 : @xmath39 so that @xmath40 is still the invariant measure of the dynamics  .",
    "a general way to construct such a @xmath37 is to consider @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant antisymmetric matrix .",
    "it is important to note that the dynamics   is non - reversible .",
    "indeed , one can check that @xmath43 has the same law as @xmath44 ( notice the minus sign in front of @xmath37 ) , and thus not the same law as @xmath45 .",
    "likewise , equation   now becomes : @xmath46 again , notice the change of sign in front of @xmath37 . from   it is clear that there are many ( in fact , infinitely many ) different ways to modify the reversible dynamics without changing the invariant measure .",
    "a natural question is whether the addition of a non - reversible term can improve the rate of convergence to equilibrium and , if so , whether there exists an optimal choice for the perturbation that maximizes the rate of convergence to equilibrium .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a complete solution to this problem when the drift term in   is linear .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath47 denote the law of the process @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e. _ the solution to the fokker - planck equation @xmath49 using the fact that @xmath13 is a stationary solution to   ( which is equivalent to  ) and under the assumption that @xmath13 satisfies the poincar inequality  , one can check that the upper bound for the reversible dynamics   is still valid : @xmath50 actually , as in the reversible case ,   ( for all initial conditions @xmath51 ) is equivalent to  .",
    "this is because   also holds for @xmath52 solution to  . in other words , adding a non - reversible part to the dynamics can not be worse than the original dynamics   ( where @xmath53 ) in terms of exponential rate of convergence .    what we show below ( for a linear drift )",
    "is that it is possible to choose @xmath37 in order to obtain a convergence at exponential rate of the form : @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is important to note the presence of the constant @xmath57 in the right - hand side of  . for a reversible diffusion ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "the spectral theorem forces the optimal @xmath58 to be equal to one , and @xmath59 , the poincar inequality constant of @xmath13 ( since   implies  ) .",
    "the interest in adding a non - reversible perturbation is precisely to allow for a constant @xmath56 , which permits a rate @xmath55 .",
    "the difficulty is thus to design a @xmath37 such that @xmath60 is large and @xmath57 is not too large . in the following ,",
    "we adapt a two - stage strategy : we first optimize @xmath37 in order to get the largest possible @xmath60 , and then we discuss how the constant @xmath57 behaves for this optimal rate of convergence .",
    "this problem was studied in  @xcite for a linear drift ( namely @xmath10 is quadratic and @xmath37 is linear ) and in  @xcite for the general case .",
    "it was shown in these works that the addition of a drift function @xmath37 satisfying   helps to speed up convergence to equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the optimal convergence rate was obtained for the linear problem ( see also proposition  [ prop : spectrumb ] in the present paper ) and some explicit examples were presented , for ordinary differential equations in two and three dimensions .",
    "the behavior of the generator of the dynamics   under a strong non - reversible drift has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the spectral gap attains a finite value in the limit as the strength of the perturbation becomes infinite if and only if the operator @xmath61 has no eigenfunctions in an appropriate sobolev space of index @xmath62 . these works ,",
    "although relevant to our work , are not directly related to the present paper since our main focus is in obtaining the optimal perturbation rather than an asymptotic result .",
    "the effect of non - reversible perturbations to the constant in logarithmic sobolev inequalities ( lsi ) for diffusions have also been studied , see  @xcite . in this paper examples",
    "were presented where the addition of a non - reversible perturbation can improve the constant in the lsi .",
    "this work is also related to  @xcite , where the authors use another idea to enhance the convergence to equilibrium .",
    "the principle is to keep a reversible diffusion , but to change the underlying riemannian metric by considering @xmath63 for a well chosen matrix @xmath64 .",
    "more precisely , the authors apply this technique to a hybrid monte carlo scheme",
    ". it would be interesting to set up some test cases in order to compare the two approaches : non - reversible drift _ versus _ change of the underlying metric .",
    "finally , we would like to mention related recent works on spectral properties of non - selfadjoint operators  see for example @xcite and references therein .      in this paper , we study the case of a linear drift .",
    "namely , we consider   with a quadratic potential @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a positive definite @xmath67 symmetric matrix . in the following ,",
    "we denote @xmath68 the set of symmetric matrices and @xmath69 the set of positive definite symmetric matrices .",
    "the equilibrium distribution thus has the density @xmath70 it can be checked that if the vector field @xmath71 is linear , it satisfies   if and only if @xmath72 with @xmath73 an antisymmetric real matrix , see lemma  [ lem : nonrev_quad ] . for a given @xmath66 ,",
    "the question is thus how to choose @xmath42 in order to optimize the rate of convergence to equilibrium for the dynamics  , which in our case becomes : @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the identity matrix in @xmath76 , the set of @xmath77 real valued matrices .",
    "we provide an answer to this question .",
    "in particular :    1 .",
    "we prove that it is possible to build an optimal @xmath42 ( denoted @xmath78 ) , which yields the best possible rate @xmath60 ( denoted @xmath79 ) in  .",
    "we provide an algorithm for constructing an optimal matrix @xmath78 .",
    "we obtain estimates on the constant @xmath80 in  .",
    "it appears that this procedure becomes particularly relevant in the situation when the condition number of @xmath66 is large ( namely for an original dynamics with multiple timescales , see sections  [ sec:2d ] and  [ sec : num ] ) .",
    "discussions about the size of @xmath57 with respect to this conditioning and to the dimension @xmath5 can be carried out very accurately .",
    "the reason why the case of linear drift is amenable to analysis is because it can be reduced to a linear algebraic problem , at least for the calculation of @xmath79 and the construction of @xmath78 .",
    "one way to understand this is the following remark : the spectrum of an operator of the form ( which is precisely the form of the generator of the dynamics  ) @xmath81 can be computed in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath82 . here",
    ", @xmath82 denotes any real square matrix with positive real spectrum . in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and proposition  [ prop : spectlj ] below ) , it was indeed proven that the spectrum of @xmath83 in @xmath84 spaces weighted by the invariant measure of the dynamics ( @xmath85 ) consists of integer linear combinations of eigenvalues of @xmath82 : @xmath86 where @xmath87 denote the @xmath88 ( distinct ) eigenvalues of @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the spectral gap of the generator @xmath83 is determined by the eigenvalues of @xmath82 , and this yields a simple way to design the optimal matrix @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the control of the constant @xmath89 requires a more elaborate analysis , using wick ( in the sense of wick ordered ) calculus , see section  [ sec : returnlj ] below .",
    "compared to the related previous paper  @xcite , our contributions are threefold : ( i ) we propose an algorithm to build the optimal matrix @xmath78 , ( ii ) we discuss how to get estimates on the constant @xmath90 and ( iii ) we consider the longtime behavior of the partial differential equation   and not only of ordinary differential equations related to  . in particular , our analysis covers also non gaussian initial conditions for the sde  .",
    "although the results that we obtain have a limited practical interest ( there exist many efficient techniques to draw gaussian random variables ) , we believe that this study is a first step towards further analysis , in particular for nonlinear drift terms .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : main ] we present the main results of this paper . in section  [ sec : resc ] we perform some preliminary calculations . the linear algebraic problem and the evolution of the corresponding ordinary differential equation are studied in section  [ sec : linalg ] .",
    "direct computations of the expectations and the variances are performed in section  [ sec : gauss ] for gaussian initial data . the convergence to equilibrium for the non - reversible diffusion process for general initial data",
    "is then studied in section  [ sec : diffusion ] .",
    "results of numerical simulations are presented in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "finally , some background material on wick calculus , which is needed in the proofs of our main results , is presented in appendix  [ sec : wickcalculus ] .      for a potential given by  ,",
    "our first result is a simple lemma which characterizes all non - reversible perturbations that satisfy divergence - free condition  .",
