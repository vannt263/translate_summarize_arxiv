    "inelastic electron scattering at backward angle @xmath16 was used by barber , peterson _",
    "@xcite more than 30 years ago to study nuclear magnetic dipole ( @xmath2 ) excitations at the linear accelerator in stanford . the predominance of @xmath2 excitations in backward scattering is expected from qualitative considerations @xcite of the @xmath1 cross section in the plane wave born approximation ( pwba ) .",
    "the cross section can be decomposed in this case into longitudinal ( coulomb ) and transverse ( electric and magnetic ) terms , multiplied by corresponding kinematical factors .",
    "the electric field of the incoming electron can have both longitudinal and transverse components , while its magnetic field is purely transverse .",
    "if the electron rest mass and the nuclear excitation energy can be neglected in comparison with the incident electron energy , which is often the case with low - lying excitations , the longitudinal kinematical factor vanishes for @xmath17 and only transverse multipoles are excited by the inelastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 cross section can be related further to the transition probability for photoabsorption through approximate considerations within the `` virtual photon '' method .",
    "one arrives in this way to the rough qualitative estimate @xcite for dominant magnetic over electric transverse excitations ( both of the same multipolarity ) .",
    "this property is due to the momentum transfer during electron scattering .",
    "it stands in contrast with the corresponding relationship for radiative excitation , where no momentum is transferred and the @xmath18 excitation is one order of magnitude stronger than the @xmath19 excitation ( @xmath20 stands for multipolarity ) .",
    "a more definite qualitative conclusion about the magnetic dominance at backward angle can be drawn by assuming a purely spin - flip transition @xcite .",
    "the transverse electric field of the incoming electron is negligibly small in this particular case if the excitation energy @xmath21 is small in comparison with the transferred momentum @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath22 . the same result is obtained for a spin - flip transition in the limit of small momentum transfer , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "all these considerations are made in the long - wave limit , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the target nucleus .",
    "the momentum transfer has throughout this article the inverse dimension of length ( @xmath8 ) , i.e. , @xmath26 is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the peculiar selectivity of the backward @xmath1 scattering towards magnetic excitations was used extensively in the last decades to study @xmath2 transitions mainly in spherical nuclei @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 operator can excite there particle - hole states , which are spin - orbit partners .",
    "these excitations are therefore often called spin - flip , though the orbital part of the @xmath2 operator has also non - vanishing matrix elements @xcite .",
    "in addition to these predominantly spin transitions , a qualitatively new type of mainly orbital @xmath2 excitations with @xmath27 become possible in deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "they are closely related to the so - called scissors mode , predicted by the two - rotor model @xcite .",
    "it describes isovector rotational oscillations of neutrons against protons , which exist only in deformed nuclei .",
    "their experimental study started a decade ago through backward inelastic electron scattering at the linear accelerator in darmstadt , see e.g. the review articles @xcite .",
    "we have calculated within the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) the @xmath1 form factors of low - lying orbital @xmath2 excitations in titanium @xcite , rare - earth @xcite , and actinide @xcite nuclei .",
    "the present study was motivated firstly by noticing at higher momentum transfer some discrepancies between our theoretical @xmath2 form factors and experimental data .",
    "these deviations are not present in lighter nuclei but seemed to occur systematically in heavy nuclei .",
    "the first diffraction maximum of the experimental @xmath1 cross section is usually well described theoretically when the experimental @xmath28 value is reproduced in qrpa .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath5-dependence of the theoretical cross section becomes very sensitive to the details of the microscopic wave function at higher momentum transfer @xmath5 .",
    "our theoretical @xmath2 transition density of the 1@xmath29 excitation at 3.78 mev in @xmath30ti @xcite describes well the corresponding experimental form factor @xcite not only at low but also up to the highest measured momentum transfer , @xmath31 @xmath8 .",
    "we were even able to predict @xcite the form factor of the strongest @xmath2 excitation ( at 7.2 mev ) in this nucleus in the same @xmath5-range before the corresponding experimental data became available @xcite .",
    "the comparison with experiment can be seen in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , our theoretical @xmath2 form factors for rare - earth nuclei @xcite ,",
    "though lying within the experimental error bars , seem to underestimate systematically the experimental values even at lower momentum transfer ( for @xmath32 @xmath8 ) .",
    "in contrast to @xmath30ti , high-@xmath5 experimental data are not available for single @xmath2 excitations in heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "we were inclined to attribute initially the above discrepancies to the adopted parametrization of the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the @xmath33 excitations in deformed nuclei are weakly collective @xcite , because the main collectivity is concentrated in the spurious isoscalar rotational state .",
    "thus , the microscopic wave functions of the low - lying orbital @xmath2 excitations are very sensitive to the details of the single - particle level scheme around the fermi surface . in order to improve the agreement with the experimental form factors",
    ", we decided to shift in rare - earth nuclei the energy of several single - particle levels close to the nuclear surface @xcite , a procedure used formerly in microscopic calculations for spherical nuclei .",
    "the modified level scheme did not produce , however , a substantial improvement .",
    "thus , we turn our attention to possible contributions from other multipolarities , which should have the property of appearing only in heavy nuclei .",
    "we are going to present in the next section preliminary qualitative estimates for the expectation of @xmath0 contributions to the @xmath1 cross sections at backward angle .",
    "the microscopic calculation of transition densities within our qrpa formalism is described in sect .",
    "the theoretical @xmath1 cross sections , obtained from these transition densities in the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) for @xmath6 , are compared to experiment in sect .",
    "a qualitative analysis of our dwba results for larger backward angles is presented in sect .",
    "v using more transparent pwba estimates .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "vi . the most important ingredients of our formalism can be found in appendices a - d .",
    "our search for possible contributions from higher multipolarities was stimulated by the experimental study @xcite of the @xmath0 transition accompanying the strongest @xmath2 excitation , @xmath21 = 3.075 mev , in @xmath34gd .",
    "the @xmath0 transition excites the first member ( with @xmath3 ) of the rotational band built on the top of the vibrational state with @xmath27 .",
    "this is the only accompanying @xmath0 transition studied until now in heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "the energy separation between the two excitations ( @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) corresponds to the rotational energy @xmath35 \\hbar ^2 \\over 2 { \\cal j } }   =   { 2 \\hbar ^2 \\over { \\cal j } } ,   \\label{roten}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the moment of inertia of the rotational band developed on the intrinsic 1@xmath29 state . since its value is not known , one could use as a rough estimate the ground - state moment of inertia , determined from the energy @xmath37 of the first rotational 2@xmath29 state in @xmath34gd @xcite .",
    "the so obtained energy separation , @xmath38 kev , should be considered as an upper limit , because the rotational bands of excited states have usually larger moments of inertia than the g.s .",
    "band @xcite .",
    "the 2@xmath291 state found in @xmath34gd @xcite lies indeed only 21 kev above its 1@xmath291 band head with @xmath39 mev .",
    "this energy separation is comparable with the energy resolution @xmath40 of the considered @xmath1 experiments , 20 kev @xmath41 40 kev , depending on the incident electron energy @xcite .",
    "the largest backward angle was @xmath42 in these experiments .",
    "it corresponds to a ratio between the transverse and longitudinal kinematic factors @xcite @xmath43 although the longitudinal coulomb excitation is strongly damped by this large factor , it could still provide a @xmath10 contribution to the cross section comparable with the @xmath2 contribution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the longitudinal @xmath0 transition matrix element , before being reduced by the above factor , is usually much larger than the @xmath2 matrix element .",
    "a new 180@xmath44 electron scattering facility is already in operation in darmstadt @xcite .",
    "though the aperture of such facilities leads to a somewhat smaller effective mean angle of 178.5@xmath45 @xcite , the longitudinal contributions are already negligible at this angle , where the ratio ( [ vtrat ] ) amounts to 5848 . on the other hand ,",
    "the worsened energy resolution , typically @xmath46 kev at a fully backward angle @xcite , makes quite plausible the appearance of transverse @xmath0 contributions to the measured @xmath2 cross section , if both are of comparable magnitude .",
    "the ground state of even - even nuclei corresponds to @xmath47 , so that due to the selection rules each one of the above considered 1@xmath291 and 2@xmath291 states can be excited only by @xmath2 and @xmath0 transitions , respectively , but not by both of them .",
    "however , the multipolarity of the excited states studied is usually not known in experiment .",
    "thus , most of the former qualitative estimates for the relative @xmath48 , and @xmath19 contributions to the pwba cross section consider transitions with the same multipolarity @xmath20 in order to find out what kinematics would enhance selectively the @xmath19 excitation .",
    "in contrast , we are interested in the present study in the relative @xmath0 and @xmath2 contributions .",
    "they excite two different states , but contribute nevertheless to the experimentally measured cross section only because in heavy deformed nuclei the energy separation of the two states is comparable with the experimental energy resolution .",
    "this situation does not occur in lighter even - even nuclei whose small moment of inertia produces a large energy separation between the two states and the two cross sections are easily resolved in experiment .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 both longitudinal @xmath10 and transverse @xmath0 components , unless one of them is specified explicitly .",
    "our study was motivated also by one of the first calculations of @xmath1 cross sections in heavy deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the pwba cross sections for members of the ground - state and @xmath49-vibrational bands in @xmath50sm are obtained in the collective tassie model assuming an incompressible and irrotational fluid .",
    "although a purely longitudinal ( coulomb ) excitation is described by this simple model , the qualitative @xmath5-behaviour of the calculated cross sections supports our expectations of improving the @xmath2 cross sections by taking @xmath0 contributions into account : i ) the diffraction maxima of higher multipolarities have smaller amplitudes but are broader , ii ) the @xmath51 state of the @xmath49-vibrational band has even a larger cross section than the band head ( 0@xmath290 ) , i.e. the magnitude ordering is inversed for the intrinsic excitation with respect to the g.s",
    "these qualitative features were confirmed experimentally some 20 years later @xcite through @xmath1 on @xmath52gd .",
    "the above arguments about possible appreciable @xmath0 electroexcitations even at backward angles stimulated us to examine more carefully the qualitative estimates , on which the commonly expected @xmath2 dominance in backward electron scattering is based .",
    "the relative contribution of the transverse magnetic and electric terms to the @xmath1 cross section is given by the approximate pwba relationship @xcite : @xmath53 where we have used the correct ratio from eq .",
    "( 30 ) of ref .",
    "the factor 10 is a rough estimate for the ratio between the two cross sections at the photon point where they are proportional to the respective reduced probabilities for radiative transitions .",
    "thus , one should expect predominantly magnetic excitations in backward electron scattering , because in most experiments @xmath54 .",
    "but the qualitative relationship ( [ barb ] ) was derived within the `` virtual photon '' method valid for @xmath23 .",
    "it was stated explicitly @xcite that the relationship ( [ barb ] ) is not enough to upset in general the dominant magnetic character of backward electron scattering .",
    "more detailed considerations will be discussed in sect .",
    "v below .    without recurring to virtual photons , willey arrives to a more general qualitative relationship between the two cross sections @xcite : @xmath55 the magnetic transition is obviously dominant , because ( [ willey ] ) is derived in the long - wave limit , @xmath24 .",
    "however , the long - wave approximation is not fulfilled in the above discussed experiments with heavy nuclei @xcite , where @xmath56 @xmath57 fm , and @xmath58 . with this numerical value",
    "one could conclude from ( [ willey ] ) that the transverse electric should be comparable with the transverse magnetic electroexcitation , and even dominant for @xmath59 @xmath8 , i.e. in the region where we expect important @xmath0 contributions .",
    "of course , ( [ willey ] ) is no more valid for such large values of @xmath60 .",
    "the above simple considerations are not able to provide a reliable prediction for the relative interplay of electric and magnetic electroexcitations in backward scattering .",
    "they ignore the dynamics contained in the wave functions of the studied nuclear excitations .",
    "more definite conclusions can be drawn only from realistic microscopic calculations which are able to provide satisfactory quantitative description of the experimental data .",
    "we are using the dwba because the large charge of heavy nuclei produces a strong coulomb potential distorting the electromagnetic field of the incoming electron .",
    "after our first encouraging results on @xmath34gd @xcite , we are going to study here the problem of electric contributions to backward scattering more systematically and to compare our theoretical results with all the available experimental cross sections for single @xmath2 excitations in rare - earth nuclei .",
    "we solve the qrpa equations of motion for intrinsic excitations with @xmath61 using a model hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath62 , \\quad t = n , \\ , p ,   \\quad r = { k_1 \\over k_0 } , \\label{ham } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the isospin index @xmath63 denotes neutrons or protons .",
    "the quasiparticle ( q.p . )",
    "mean field @xmath64 @xcite is given by an axially - symmetric woods - saxon potential @xcite plus bcs pairing .",
    "apart from the deformation , all the remaining woods - saxon parameters are given for each nucleus by the isospin dependent parametrization of ref .",
    "it is based on a single set of isospin independent parameters for all nuclei without respect to their mass and charge numbers .",
    "the hexadecapole deformation is taken from experiment @xcite , while the quadrupole one is determined for each nucleus by fitting the microscopically calculated ground state quadrupole moment to the corresponding experimental value @xcite .",
    "as in most of our previous works , we use an oscillator constant @xmath65 mev and include in the basis ( [ basis ] ) all the oscillator eigenfunctions with principal quantum numbers ( [ qnum ] ) @xmath66 . the pairing gaps are chosen to reproduce roughly the even - odd mass differences @xcite .",
    "the next two terms in the model hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) are separable residual interactions of quadrupole and spin type , respectively .",
    "the former interaction is constructed with operators of quadrupole type @xmath67 ( [ ham ] ) derived from the deformed part of the q.p .",
    "mean field @xcite .",
    "the total angular momentum @xmath68 ( [ mop ] ) is symmetrized over the signature @xmath69 , see appendix b. the isoscalar coupling constant @xmath70 of @xmath71 is determined microscopically @xcite in order to restore the rotational invariance of the model hamiltonian , violated by the deformation . the value @xmath72 is adopted for the ratio ( [ ham ] ) between the isovector and the isoscalar coupling constants .",
    "this choice , discussed in @xcite , gives rise in qrpa to a high - lying @xmath0 strength , whose energy distribution reproduces qualitatively the isovector giant quadrupole resonance observed in @xmath1 experiments .",
    "we adopt the above rough round value , because of the uncertainties of the scarce experimental data on heavy deformed nuclei .",
    "our attention is focused here on the low - lying orbital @xmath2 excitations , which are not very sensitive towards the strength of the isovector quadrupole interaction .",
    "they are influenced much stronger by the exclusion of spuriousity through restoration of the rotational invariance .",
    "they acquire afterwards a well pronounced character of isovector rotational vibrations @xcite .    the last term in ( [ ham ] )",
    "is the spin - spin interaction @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "we present here results for all the rare - earth nuclei with experimentally measured @xmath1 cross sections of single 1@xmath29 excitations .",

    "the large ratio @xmath76 @xcite between the orbital and spin @xmath2 matrix elements of each excitation , listed in the last column of table [ tabrpa ] , indicates that these are predominantly orbital transitions .",

    "<S> important @xmath0 contributions to the @xmath1 cross sections of low - lying orbital @xmath2 excitations are found in heavy deformed nuclei , arising from the small energy separation between the two excitations with @xmath3 and 1@xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they are studied microscopically in qrpa using dwba . </S>",
    "<S> the accompanying @xmath0 response is negligible at small momentum transfer @xmath5 but contributes substantially to the cross sections measured at @xmath6 for @xmath7 @xmath8 ( @xmath9 mev ) and leads to a very good agreement with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the electric response is of longitudinal @xmath10 type for @xmath11 but becomes almost purely transverse @xmath0 for larger backward angles . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse @xmath0 response remains comparable with the @xmath2 response for @xmath12 @xmath8 ( @xmath13 mev ) and even dominant for @xmath14 mev . </S>",
