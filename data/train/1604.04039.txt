    "the first subexponential upper bound on @xmath13 is due to kalai and kleitman  @xcite who proved in 1992 that @xmath13 is at most @xmath2 .",
    "the key ingredient for their proof is a recursive inequality on @xmath13 , which we call the _ kalai - kleitman inequality_. the kalai - kleitman inequality was later extended to more general settings such as connected layer families by eisenbrand et al .",
