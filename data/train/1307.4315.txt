    ".    the need for analysis based on resonance came from initial te wave measurements that were made at cesrta in 2008 . a new configuration of beam - pipe",
    "was installed in the l0 section of cesrta that included a number of beam - pipe transitions , instrumentation , longitudinal slots to connect ion pumps to the vacuum space and six superconducting wigglers .",

    "these slots reduce the coupling of beam - induced signal into the pumps , but also generate reflections for a te wave that is propagating through the beam - pipe .",

    "the response at 15e does not match that of a rectangular cavity as well as 43e .",

    "in some circumstances it is possible to measure the frequency shift directly , as when a storage ring is almost entirely filled with bunches  generating an ec density that is nearly constant with time . for bunch trains and electron cloud lifetimes that are short compared to the storage ring revolution period , there is a modulation of the ec density and a corresponding modulation of the cavity s resonant frequency .",
