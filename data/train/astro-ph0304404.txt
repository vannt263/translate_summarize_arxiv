    "elliptical galaxies which reside in a cluster show a tight color - magnitude ( cm ) relation ; brighter ellipticals are systematically redder than fainter ones ( e.g. , bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ) .",
    "recently , it has been found that the relation still holds even in distant rich clusters up to @xmath10 ( e.g. , stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson 1998 ) . based on these observational results , galaxy evolution models taking into account chemical evolution claim that ellipticals in rich clusters formed at high redshift ( e.g. , @xmath11 ) by a monolithic collapse of a gas cloud ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kodama et al .",
    "however there is another formation scenario for elliptical galaxies , i.e. , the hierarchical merging scenario , which may also explain these observational results ( e.g. , kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; shioya & bekki 1998 ) . which of the scenarios dominates the formation of elliptical galaxies has been one of the controversial issues . in order to address this problem , observational properties representing histories of dynamical evolution such as merging histories as well as histories of chemical evolution of galaxies should be focused on .",
    "one of the promising candidates is a radial variation of stellar metallicity , i.e. , a metallicity gradient , in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "metallicity gradients in elliptical galaxies are expected to represent how the galaxies have assembled .",
    "_ in the monolithic collapse scenario _",
    ", a metallicity gradient in an elliptical galaxy can be built up by a dissipative collapse in its formation phase associated with a burst of star formation and a subsequent galactic wind , because of a more extended period of active star formation and more metal enrichment in the inner region ( larson 1974a , b ; carlberg 1984 ; martinelli et al .",
    "1998 ; tantalo et al .",
    "1998 ; kawata 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , more massive ellipticals are predicted to have steeper gradients ( larson 1974b ; carlberg 1984 ) .",
    "_ in the hierarchical merging scenario _",
    ", stellar populations in the progenitor galaxies are expected to be well mixed in major mergers and the existing metallicity gradients are likely to be diluted ( white 1980 ) .",
    "although metallicity gradients may be newly produced due to secondary star formations induced by mergers ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , these gradients are suggested to be appreciably shallower than those expected by the monolithic collapse scenario ( bekki & shioya 1999 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that in this scenario , the metallicity gradients would be different from galaxy to galaxy due to their different histories of mass assembly and star formation .",
    "therefore , no strong correlation between metallicity gradient and galaxy mass would be expected .",
    "although more massive ellipticals might have shallower gradients because they are expected to experience more galaxy mergers in the hierarchical merging scheme and their metallicity gradients may be smeared out more seriously , it is opposite to the correlation expected by the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "evolutionary histories of elliptical galaxies can be dependent on galaxy environment .",
    "the presence of tight cm relations in rich clusters at high redshift seems to support the monolithic formation at , e.g. , @xmath12 for ellipticals in such high density environments ( e.g. , kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) . even in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe , high peaks of density fluctuations at such high redshifts could form giant galaxies and be related to clusters of galaxies along the biased galaxy formation scenario ( peacock 1999 and references therein ) . since it is expected that the mean density of matter is high and objects are gas - rich at those epochs , formations of galaxies are predicted to be accelerated .",
    "this implies that elliptical galaxies in dense environments formed through bursts of star formation at high redshift , which mimic the initial starbursts expected in the monolithic collapse scenario , and tend to reside in rich clusters . on the other hand",
    ", the field corresponds to the environment without such high peaks of density fluctuations .",
    "the density fluctuations are expected to evolve more slowly and collapse at lower redshifts .",
    "galaxies would evolve more quiescently through bottom - up processes of smaller sub - galaxies and could settle down to disk galaxies preferentially . in this case ,",
    "elliptical galaxies are more likely to form through major mergers of disk galaxies at low redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath13 ) . indeed , some recent observational or theoretical studies suggest that elliptical galaxies which formed through major mergers tend to inhabit in field environments and they have experienced mergers inducing star formation until recent epochs such as @xmath14 ( e.g. , baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; governato et al . 1999 ; kauffmann 1996 ; menanteau et al . 1999 ; menanteau , abraham , & ellis 2001 ) .",
    "such late star forming activities could make their luminosity - weighted ages at @xmath15 systematically younger ( terlevich & forbes 2002 ) .    in summary ,",
    "if we consider that elliptical galaxies in cluster environments are suggested to have formed through a process like the monolithic collapse while those in sparse environments are through major mergers , the formers are predicted to have steeper metallicity gradients on average than the latter .",
    "also , a clear correlation between metallicity gradients and global properties of galaxies ( mass , size , luminosity , etc ) is not expected for ellipticals in sparse environments but expected for cluster ellipticals . to see whether observational data show these kinds of environmental dependence or not will provide strong constraints on the formation processes of galaxies and the roles played by galaxy environments in evolutionary histories of galaxies .",
    "although the above issues motivate us to examine metallicity gradients in elliptical galaxies , the problem is how the gradients are to be examined observationally .",
    "it is known that nearby elliptical galaxies have color gradients ; colors in an elliptical galaxy gradually become bluer with increasing radius ( e.g. , vader et al .",
    "1988 ; franx , illingworth , & heckman 1989 ; peletier et al . 1990a ; peletier , valentijn , & jameson 1990b ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "1994 ; michard 1999 ; idiart , michard , & de freitas pacheco 2002 ) .",
    "although the age  metallicity degeneracy prevents us from interpreting the origin of the color gradients to be the metallicity gradients , an evolution of a color gradient with redshift has been studied to disentangle the degeneracy and it is concluded that the primary origin of color gradients in elliptical are not the age gradients but the metallicity gradients both for the elliptical galaxies in field environments and for those in cluster environments ( tamura et al .",
    "2000 ; tamura & ohta 2000 ; saglia et al .",
    "2000 ; see also hinkley & i m 2001 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned here that dust extinction may have some effects on a color gradient in an elliptical galaxy ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if an elliptical galaxy consists of a mixture of stars without any population gradients and diffusely distributed dust , a calculation of the radiative transfer within the galaxy suggests that the color gradients could be reproduced only by the dust effects ( witt , thronson , & capuano 1992 ; wise & silva 1996 ) .",
    "however , many elliptical galaxies show radial gradients of metal absorption line index such as mg@xmath16 , fe@xmath17(5270  ) and fe@xmath16(5335  ) as well as the color gradients ( e.g. , carollo , danziger , & buson 1993 ; davies , sadler , & peletier 1993 ; gonzlez 1993 ; kobayashi & arimoto 1999 ; mehlert et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the radial gradients of the metal absorption line indices are unlikely to be created by dust extinction .",
    "it has also been suggested that _ on average _ , metallicity gradients in elliptical galaxies as estimated by a population synthesis model from color gradients are consistent with those estimated from absorption line index gradients ( e.g. , peletier et al .",
    "1990a ; davies et al .",
    "1993 ) , although there are exceptions .",
    "we thus assume that metallicity effects seem to be the prime cause of color gradients in elliptical galaxies . although both color gradients and metal absorption line strength gradients can be used to trace the metallicity gradients , we study color gradients in this paper because broad band imaging observations are much easier to obtain high @xmath18 data to study the gradients in elliptical galaxies and to enlarge samples including further extension towards high @xmath19 in future .",
    "the previous studies suggest that the color gradients in nearby elliptical galaxies do not correlate with any global properties ( mass , luminosity , etc ) of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , peletier et al .",
    "kobayashi & arimoto ( 1999 ) presented the same results by compiling the data of the mg@xmath16 gradients in the literature and constructing a large sample of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "these studies may support the merging scenario .",
    "however , it should be stressed that most of the ellipticals studied reside in low density environments such as field or group .",
    "although some elliptical galaxies in virgo cluster have been studied ( peletier et al .",
    "1990a ; goudfrooij et al .",
    "1994 ; michard 1999 ; idiart et al .",
    "2002 ) , virgo cluster is not a rich cluster but a poor cluster with a rather sparse spatial distribution of galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely to be sufficient to know whether there is a dependence of color gradient on galaxy environment or not , and one of the straightforward extensions to address this issue is to study elliptical galaxies in rich clusters .    in this study",
    ", we examine color gradients in elliptical galaxies in a nearby rich cluster , abell 2199 .",
    "it is known that this cluster is significantly richer than virgo cluster and is a spiral poor and centrally concentrated cd cluster ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1985 ) .",
    "it is also considered to be a relaxed cluster based on its regular and symmetrical appearance in x - ray ( e.g. , buote & canizares 1996 ) .",
    "although coma cluster is a good candidate as a nearby typical rich cluster and global properties of the member galaxies have been well studied , it has been pointed out to be a merging cluster with two x - ray peaks ( e.g. , caldwell et al . 1993 ;",
    "burns et al .",
    "1994 ) and thus the galaxies in coma cluster may have been also disturbed by recent galaxy mergers .",
    "we consider that elliptical galaxies in a more regular and relaxed cluster should be studied at first .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "observation and data reduction are described in the next section . in   3 , sample definition is described and radial profiles of surface brightness and color of the sample galaxies are presented .",
    "also , color gradients in the sample galaxies are derived and their statistical properties are investigated .",
    "we discuss implications of the results in   4 , and summarize this paper in   5 .",
    "we assume @xmath20 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 throughout this paper .",
    "imaging observations in @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands were made on june 20 and 21 , 2001 , with tektronix 2k@xmath222k ccd on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope .",
    "one pixel of the ccd chip corresponds to @xmath23 and thus each frame covers an area of about @xmath24 .",
    "observation log is presented in table [ list1 ] .",
    "although early - type ( e , e / s0 , and s0 ) galaxies in abell 2199 were primary targets in this observing run , the central region of abell 2634 was also observed as a pilot study to extend our sample to other clusters .",
    "( abell 2634 is also a centrally concentrated cluster but slightly less rich than abell 2199 ( e.g. , pinkney et al .",
    "in addition , 3 elliptical galaxies ( ngc 5638 , ngc 5831 , and ngc 7619 ) , of which color gradients were examined in the previous studies , were observed for comparison .",
    "a typical seeing size during the observing run was @xmath25 in fwhm .",
    "total exposure time at each field is typically 1,800 sec for @xmath0 band and 750 sec for @xmath1 band , each of which was divided into three or four exposures with dithering .",
    "all of the imaging data were reduced with iraf in the standard procedure .",
    "after bias subtraction , flat - fielding by dome - flat frames , and sky subtraction were carried out in each frame , both of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 band images at each field were registered by sub - pixel shifts .",
    "next , slight differences in flux among the images in each band were corrected by multiplying an image by a constant , and the fwhms of the point spread functions ( psfs ) were matched by convolutions of images with gaussian kernels .",
    "these images were combined with the 3 @xmath26 clipping algorithm .",
    "after a stacked image was made in each band , a psf size in one band was matched to that in the other band by smoothing with gaussian kernels .",
    "a resulting psf size is typically @xmath27 in fwhm .",
    "the photometric calibration was done by using the standard stars in landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "aperture photometry was carried out after a subtraction of a local residual sky background around each galaxy , which was determined by `` mode '' in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath28 and a width of @xmath29 ( 50 pix ) . in order to check the accuracy of the photometry and sky subtraction , growth curves of the objects",
    "were compared with those taken from hypercat : several galaxies in the clusters as well as ngc 5638 , ngc 5831 , and ngc 7619 have the data of aperture photometry .",
    "it is found that there seem to be zero - point offsets between our growth curves and those taken from hypercat , though the amounts of the offsets are @xmath30 mag in each band .",
    "this may imply that the observational condition was slightly non - photometric .",
    "however , if we correct for the offsets in each field , a tight cm relation consistent with that observed in coma cluster is obtained both in abell 2199 and in abell 2634 .",
    "we calculated an average amount of the zero - point shift on each night and it is corrected for by a constant offset in the following analyses .",
    "since we focus on a color gradient in a galaxy in this study , such zero - point offset does not cause any serious effects .",
    "the target fields were chosen based on the catalogs of early - type galaxies in the clusters by lucey et al .",
    "40 early - type ( e , e / s0 , and s0 ) galaxies in abell 2199 and 11 early - type galaxies in abell 2634 are included in the fields ; most of the galaxy morphology is originally from butcher & oemler ( 1985 ) and rood & sastry ( 1972 ) , while for several galaxies which had not been classified in the literature , we provided morphological types to the galaxies based on eye inspection . although we may be able to study color gradients of these morphologically selected galaxies , it is worth noting that there is a variety in spheroidal - to - total luminosity ratio among galaxies in each morphological type ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) . in addition , since the clusters studied here are relatively distant , visual classifications of morphology of fainter galaxies may be less reliable . in order to reduce contamination of disk dominated galaxies in a sample , we made azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles in @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands of each galaxy , and performed decompositions of the profiles into bulge and disk components to estimate a bulge - to - total luminosity ratio ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the radial surface brightness profiles are obtained along ellipses fitted to the isophotes with the ellipse task in the stsdas package with a radial sampling of 0@xmath3222 ( 1 pix ) along major axis . in fitting an ellipse to an isophote , ellipticity is set to be a free parameter .",
    "galaxy center is fixed to a centroid of a galaxy in the @xmath1 band image and position angle is also fixed to that of an ellipse within which half of the galaxy light is included . even though position angle is allowed to be a free parameter ,",
    "no significant differences in the surface brightness profiles appear . in the following analyses ,",
    "all of the radial profiles and the parameters related to radius are expressed in terms of the equivalent radius of an ellipse : @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the semi - major and semi - minor axes of the ellipse .",
    "the ellipse task employs an iterative algorithm of rejecting pixels significantly deviant from an average on each ellipse .",
    "this enables us to eliminate effects of contamination of background / foreground objects at least to some extent .",
    "however , since bright objects in the neighbor of a target galaxy may have serious effects on the fitted ellipses , the neighbors are masked out beforehand .",
    "it is found that effective radii and color gradients are nearly invariant to whether these masking processes are applied or not and the differences are comparable to or smaller than errors in the individual measurements of the parameters . in practice , some galaxies are `` embedded '' in an envelope of a large galaxy in the neighbor . in order to dig a galaxy out of the envelope , we model the neighboring galaxy using the bmodel task in the stsdas package and subtract it . in most cases ,",
    "an estimated effective radius and color gradient in such an `` embedded '' galaxy only slightly depend on whether the subtraction process is applied or not , though there are a few galaxies in which the discrepancies can amount to @xmath36% in effective radius and @xmath37 mag / dex in color gradient .",
    "although we include galaxies in the following analyses and adopt the parameters estimated after the subtraction processes , they are flagged in the results to show that the subtraction processes are employed and the measurements of effective radii and color gradients may be more uncertain .",
    "the decomposition was performed by fitting a surface brightness profile with the sum of an @xmath38 law bulge and an exponential disk profiles so as to minimize @xmath39 .",
    "we considered seeing effects on the surface brightness profiles using the formulation by pritchet & kline ( 1981 ) .",
    "we chose to sample early - type galaxies of which @xmath31s in @xmath0 band are estimated to be larger than 0.6 .",
    "this criterion isolates galaxies earlier than e / s0 or @xmath40 according to simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) , where @xmath31s of nearby galaxies are also derived in @xmath0 band . in this selection procedure ,",
    "31 galaxies are picked out in abell 2199 , while @xmath41% ( 3/25 ) of the ellipticals ( e and e / s0 ) and @xmath42% ( 6/15 ) of the s0 galaxies among the 40 ellipticals and s0s were excluded . in abell 2634 ,",
    "7 galaxies are picked out and two of the elliptical galaxies and one of the s0 galaxies were excluded .",
    "these fractions are consistent with those expected from the dispersion of the relation between morphological type and @xmath31 suggested by simien & de vaucouleurs ( 1986 ) . it is suggested according to the decomposition that in almost all the sample galaxies , spheroidal components dominate in surface brightness at radii where radial profiles of color are obtained reliably and color gradients are calculated .",
    "however , for two of the galaxies in abell 2199 , their surface brightness profiles suggest that disk light starts dominating at a radius smaller than the outer cut - off radius in deriving a color gradient ( see   [ clg ] for detail of outer cut - off radius ) .",
    "therefore , we excluded these two galaxies .",
    "hence , the sample in abell 2199 consists of 29 early - type galaxies .",
    "the r band images of the sample galaxies are shown in the top panels of figure 1 , and their observational properties are listed in table [ list2 ] .",
    "the total magnitudes were obtained by using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and the `` best '' magnitudes were adopted .",
    "a @xmath2 color was calculated within an aperture whose radius is set to an effective radius of the galaxy in question . a central velocity dispersion ( @xmath43 ) and an mg@xmath44 index are taken from lucey et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the surface brightness profiles of these sample galaxies are shown in the middle panels of figure 1 .",
    "an error bar attached to each of the data points includes an photometric error , a local sky subtraction error , and a dispersion of surface brightness along each fitted ellipse .",
    "a local background around each object and its subtraction error were estimated by calculating a standard deviation around the mode in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath45 and a width of @xmath29 ( 50 pix ) . in figure 1(a ) and 1(b ) , the sample galaxies in abell 2199 and those in abell 2634 , respectively , are presented in order of @xmath1 band total magnitude . the three galaxies ( ngc 5638 , ngc 5831 , and ngc 7619 ) which were taken for calibration purposes are shown in figure 1(c ) .",
    "effective radii ( @xmath46 ) of the sample galaxies were derived by regression lines best fitted to the @xmath1 band surface brightness profiles . in fitting a regression line ,",
    "the data points in the outermost regions of which @xmath18s are low were removed beforehand .",
    "in addition , the innermost regions probably flattened by the seeing effects were not used .",
    "the resulting fitting regions are shown by the two vertical solid lines in the middle panels of figure 1 .",
    "the effective radii obtained are presented in table [ list2 ] .",
    "it is mentioned that if the innermost regions are removed properly , they are almost insensitive to the inner and outer cutoff radii .",
    "the effective radii correlate with the @xmath1 band total magnitudes : more luminous galaxies have larger effective radii , which is related to the fundamental plane .",
    "( this correlation is referred to `` scaling relation '' hereafter . )",
    "most of the sample galaxies have @xmath1 band total magnitudes between 14 mag and 16 mag , and in this magnitude range an effective radius typically varies from 6@xmath47 to @xmath48 .      before obtaining radial color profiles in the sample galaxies , it is worth addressing any trends seen in their two dimensional color distributions .",
    "we made the @xmath2 color maps of the galaxies after the seeing sizes in both of the images were matched . in figure 2(a ) and 2(b ) , the color maps of the sample galaxies in abell 2199 and abell 2634 , respectively , are presented in order of @xmath1 band total magnitude of a galaxy from left to right and from top to bottom .",
    "the three calibration galaxies ( ngc 5638 , ngc 5831 , and ngc 7619 ) are presented in figure 2(c ) . a cross mark in each panel shows the centroid of a galaxy in @xmath1 band .",
    "the regions with @xmath0 band surface brightness brighter than @xmath49 23 mag / arcsec@xmath50 in the galaxies are indicated in these color maps and gaussian smoothing with a kernel of @xmath51 was performed for the clearer presentation .",
    "these are the _ pseudo _ color maps ; a range of color adopted in each map is shown by the wedge at the right side of the panel and is different from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "we note that the features like vertical lines seen in bo 24 and ngc 7720 are caused by bad columns on the ccd surviving due to a small dithering scale in the horizontal direction at the fields .",
    "it is found that almost all the galaxies show axisymmetric color distributions independent of morphology and luminosity .",
    "this demonstrates that their radial color profiles and the color gradients represent the color distributions well .",
    "the radial profiles of @xmath2 color of the sample galaxies are shown in the bottom panels in figure 1 .",
    "each color profile was constructed by subtracting the surface brightness profile in an @xmath1 band image from that in a @xmath0 band image .",
    "both of these surface brightness profiles were made along the same ellipses fitted to isophotes in the @xmath1 band image .",
    "an error bar attached to each data point in the color profile includes a photometric error , a local sky subtraction error , and a dispersion of colors along each elliptical isophote .",
    "most of these color profiles between the inner and outer cut - off radii ( see next subsection for detail ) seem to be linear , while some of them appear to bend in the outermost regions .",
    "deeper data are essential to confirm whether the bends are real or not and to define a color profile of a galaxy out to a larger radius .",
    "a slope of a radial color profile , that is , a color gradient in each galaxy is derived by the least square fitting method using a portion of a color profile between an inner and outer cut - off radii , which are defined as follows .",
    "the outer cut - off radius is defined to be a radius at which @xmath1 band surface brightness of a galaxy is 22.5 mag / arcsec@xmath50 .",
    "this typically corresponds to a radius at which an error of @xmath2 color amounts to @xmath49 0.1 mag .",
    "an alternative definition of the outer cut - off radius could be effective radius .",
    "however , since a less luminous early - type galaxy tends to have a smaller effective radius , the number of data points available to fit a regression line to derive a color gradient is significantly reduced and thus the number of galaxies in which color gradients are derived reliably is also reduced . if a threshold in surface brightness is adopted to define the cut - off radius , the effects of the reductions are mitigated",
    "it should be stressed here that the color profiles in most of the sample galaxies are well approximated by lines even if the regions beyond their effective radii are included . for these reasons ,",
    "we have chosen to use not an effective radius but a radius defined by the surface brightness for the outer cut - off radius .",
    "the inner cut - off radius is necessary to avoid seeing effects on color profiles .",
    "colors in the inner regions of a galaxy are affected more seriously by seeing than those in the outer regions , which can cause some amount of change in color gradient . in order to understand seeing effects on color gradients in our data and to define the inner cut - off radius optimal for our study , galaxies simulated with the mkobject task in the artdata package are put onto blank fields in the stacked images .",
    "the model galaxies are assumed to have de vaucouleurs law profiles , each of which is convolved with a gaussian kernel with the same fwhm as that in the image .",
    "an integrated @xmath2 color in a model galaxy is assumed to be 1.5 mag .",
    "an `` intrinsic '' color gradient is given to a model galaxy by adopting a smaller effective radius in @xmath1 band than that in @xmath0 band , and three cases of color gradient ( @xmath52 , and @xmath530.3 mag@xmath54dex ) are simulated .",
    "since seeing effects on color gradients may depend on angular size and ellipticity of galaxy ( e.g. , peletier et al .",
    "1990a ) , the parameters of the model galaxies are sampled from the ranges covered by the sample galaxies : apparent magnitude in @xmath1 band ( 14 , 15 , and 16 mag ) , effective radius ( 1@xmath47 , 3@xmath47 , and 6@xmath47 ) and ellipticity ( 0.1 , 0.4 , and 0.7 ) .",
    "the magnitude and effective radius were assigned to a model galaxy taking into account the scaling relation at the distance of the cluster and the typical dispersion around the relation .",
    "it should be also kept in mind that psfs are not necessarily circular in real images .",
    "since such non - circular psfs may have effects on color gradients , they are also to be considered in the simulations . in order to see",
    "whether psfs are circular in our data or not , we picked up bright stellar objects using sextractor based on the `` class star '' parameter and examined their shapes .",
    "it is found that psfs tend to be slightly deviant from circles and the ellipticities are between 0 and 0.1 , and a typical value is @xmath55 . for position angle , it is suggested that the seeing effects on a color profile are more serious when the position angle of a non - circular psf is perpendicular to that of a galaxy ( e.g. , michard 1999 ) .",
    "accordingly , we assume a psf with an ellipticity of 0.1 and a position angle perpendicular to that of a model galaxy to simulate the worse case .",
    "the model galaxies are analyzed in the same way as the real galaxies including corrections for differences in seeing size between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images , and their color profiles and color gradients are obtained .",
    "the simulations are executed in all the stacked images . in the following ,",
    "several characteristics of the seeing effects on color profiles and color gradients are mentioned based on the results of the simulations .",
    "\\(1 ) first , basic trends of the seeing effects on radial color profiles are described in a qualitative way .",
    "if a seeing size in a @xmath0 band image is larger than that in an @xmath1 band image , a color in the innermost portion after correction for the difference in seeing size between the images , which is referred to `` convolved color '' hereafter , becomes redder than the intrinsic color .",
    "the convolved color becomes bluer monotonically with increasing radius , and in the outer region , it becomes bluer than the intrinsic color .",
    "( the turnover occurs around an effective radius of a galaxy . ) in other words , a color gradient steeper than the intrinsic value would be obtained due to the seeing effects .",
    "if a seeing size in an @xmath1 band image is larger , the convolved color becomes slightly bluer than the intrinsic one near the galaxy center and becomes redder with radius .",
    "after it overtakes the intrinsic color , the color profile has a peak and the convolved color becomes bluer with radius .",
    "eventually , it becomes bluer than the intrinsic color in the outer region . even in this case , a color gradient is estimated to be steeper than the intrinsic one , unless all the data points including the innermost one are used to derive a color gradient from the color profile .",
    "\\(2 ) in the following , we mention the seeing effects more quantitatively together with dependencies of the seeing effects on parameters of the model galaxies .",
    "the deviation of the color gradient affected by seeing from the intrinsic value is larger for a galaxy with a smaller effective radius , i.e. , with a more compact light distribution .",
    "a typical amount of the deviation is estimated to be @xmath56 mag / dex , @xmath57 mag / dex and @xmath58 mag / dex for an effective radius of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "\\(3 ) the deviation is larger for a galaxy with a steeper intrinsic color gradient .",
    "along with the variation of the intrinsic color gradient from @xmath61 to @xmath62 mag / dex , a typical amount of the deviation increases from @xmath56 mag / dex to @xmath58 mag / dex .",

    "basically , a larger inner cut - off radius tends to make the seeing effects on a color gradient less serious .",
    "however , the number of the data points with high @xmath18s available to fit the regression line to the color profile would be also reduced and thus the error in the measurement of color gradient would be larger .",
    "this is likely to be more serious for the less luminous and thus smaller galaxy . considering these effects",

    "these results are independent of whether the `` embedded '' galaxies are excluded from the samples or not .",
    "we next examine the relations between the color gradients and global properties of the cluster galaxies . in figure 5 , the @xmath2 color gradients in the sample galaxies",

    "as seen in figure 5 , there are no clear correlations when we consider the whole sample . however ,",
    "in the relation between the color gradients and @xmath1 band total magnitudes of the galaxies in abell 2199 , it is suggested that there is a discontinuity in the relation around @xmath71 mag , that is , the relation in the magnitude range brighter than @xmath71 mag may be different from that in the fainter magnitude range . for the galaxies brighter than @xmath71 mag , a weak correlation may exist : brighter galaxies have steeper color gradients .",

    "the @xmath1 band apparent magnitude of 15 mag corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath72 mag and thus @xmath73 ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "similar features appear to exist in the relation between the color gradients and effective radii : there seems to be a break around an effective radius of @xmath60 , which roughly corresponds to @xmath74 mag considering the scaling relation , and for the galaxies with effective radii larger than @xmath9 , the galaxies with larger effective radii tend to have steeper color gradients .",
    "these trends are preserved if the `` embedded '' galaxies ( open circles in figure 5 ) are excluded from the diagrams .",
    "although it is unclear for the galaxies in abell 2634 whether such trends exist or not due to the small number of the galaxies , the data points appear to be consistent with the trends seen for the galaxies in abell 2199 . it should be stressed here that these trends are not expected by the seeing effects , because the seeing effects could make color gradients steeper for less luminous and thus smaller galaxies .",
    "almost the same trends are seen when the inner cut - off radius is adopted to be @xmath75 . on the other hand",
    ", they disappear when the cut - off radius is defined to be @xmath76 , probably because of the seeing effects .",
    "although similar trends are expected to be seen in the relations with the central velocity dispersions and mg@xmath44 indices , no clear trends are seen .",
    "we suggest that this is at least partly due to the relatively large errors of central velocity dispersion and mg@xmath44 index .",
    "in fact , these quantities from lucey et al .",
    "( 1997 ) only weakly correlate with the @xmath1 band total magnitudes and effective radii obtained from our data .",
    "if evolutionary histories of elliptical galaxies depend on galaxy environment , their metallicity gradients and thus color gradients could also have some environmental dependences . as described in   1 , recent studies either observationally or theoretically suggest that ellipticals which reside in rich clusters tend to have formed through the formation processes quite similar to the monolithic collapse ,",
    "in which more massive ellipticals have been suggested to have steeper metallicity gradients ( larson 1974b ; carlberg 1984 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "elliptical galaxies in less dense environments are likely to have formed through major mergers , which are expected to dilute the existing metallicity gradients and any correlations between metallicity gradients and global properties of the galaxies .",
    "consequently , a significant difference in statistical property of color gradient between elliptical galaxies in rich clusters and those in the sparse environments is expected .",
    "the motivation of this study is to examine these issues observationally by adding the data of color gradients in elliptical galaxies in rich clusters , which have been rarely studied .",
    "the mean value of the color gradient obtained in the ellipticals in abell 2199 and abell 2634 is @xmath4 mag / dex . using a simple stellar population model by vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this color gradient is converted to a metallicity gradient ( @xmath5 ) of @xmath77 by assuming an age of 12 gyr . on the other hand , numerical simulations based on",
    "the monolithic collapse scenario by carlberg ( 1984 ) and by kobayashi ( 2002 ) predicted a metallicity gradient of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively , which are significantly steeper than our estimated metallicity gradient .",
    "however , it has been recently suggested that if a proto - galactic gas cloud has small scale density fluctuations expected in the cdm universe rather than a uniform density , an elliptical galaxy could form by the initial starburst following the successive assembly of low mass and gas - rich sub - clumps , and the metallicity gradient and @xmath2 color gradient in the galaxy could be consistent with our results ( kawata 2001 ) . in his simulation , a giant elliptical with a @xmath0 band absolute magnitude of @xmath80 mag at @xmath15 was studied , and its metallicity gradient and @xmath2 color gradient were estimated to be @xmath81 and @xmath82 mag / dex , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with the gradients in the brightest galaxies obtained in our study .",
    "if that process is more realistic in the monolithic collapse , our results may imply that elliptical galaxies in rich clusters tend to have formed through a process like the monolithic collapse .",
    "our data suggest that for the galaxies in the clusters brighter than @xmath74 mag and those with effective radii larger than @xmath83 , more luminous and larger galaxies tend to have steeper color gradients .",
    "this tendency can be seen in the results by numerical simulation based on the monolithic collapse scenario ( larson 1974b ; carlberg 1984 ; see also kawata & gibson 2002 ) .",
    "thus it also seems to support the view that the cluster ellipticals formed by the monolithic collapse scenario .",
    "since the trend found is rather weak and may not be very convincing , it is important to study ellipticals in other rich clusters .",
    "it is interesting that the correlation seen for the galaxies brighter than @xmath71 mag does not seem to continue to the lower luminosity range .",
    "it has been suggested that ellipticals less luminous than @xmath8 have observational properties ( isophotal shape , kinematics , etc ) different from more luminous ones ( e.g. , bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; faber et al .",
    "1997 ) and thus have different formation mechanisms .",
    "the discontinuity found here may be another piece of the evidence , even though the color gradients in the less luminous galaxies obtained in this study are still uncertain . deeper observations in sub - arcsecond seeing conditions are necessary for more detailed study .",
    "we are now in a position to compare the cluster ellipticals with those in less dense environments . in figure 4 ,",
    "the histograms of the color gradients of the galaxies in abell 2199 and abell 2634 are compared with those of 42 nearby elliptical galaxies studied by michard ( 1999 ) , 39 elliptical galaxies by peletier et al .",
    "( 1990a ) , and 17 elliptical galaxies by franx et al .",
    "some of the ellipticals studied in the literature are located in nearby clusters .",
    "most of them are virgo ellipticals , and a handful of ellipticals in the other poor clusters ( fornax , awm 4 , and awm 5 ) or rich clusters ( coma cluster , pegasus cluster , abell 2029 , and abell 2162 ) are included .",
    "we also calculated the mean value of the color gradient and the standard deviation in a sub - sample of the cluster ellipticals , and the results are presented in table [ values ] .",

    "( 1990a ) and by franx et al . ( 1989 ) , though it is slightly shifted to a steeper side than the distribution by michard ( 1999 ) .",
    "color gradients do not well correlate with each other ( michard 1999 ) . ]",
    "the similarity in the distribution suggests that distribution of color gradient is almost independent of galaxy environment .",
    "next , using the published data , color gradients in nearby elliptical galaxies are plotted against the @xmath0 band absolute magnitudes ( figure 6(a ) ) and effective radii ( figure 6(b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath0 band absolute magnitudes and effective radii in the diagram by idiart et al .",
    "( 2002 ) were taken from michard ( 1999 ) and michard & marchal ( 1994 ) . in the other diagrams ,",
    "the data presented in each literature were used . since effective radii measured along major axis",
    "are tabulated in peletier et al .",
    "( 1990a ) and goudfrooij et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we converted them to the equivalent radii using the ellipticities in the literature .",

    "open circles and open squares denote ellipticals in virgo cluster and those in the other poor clusters , respectively .",
    "open triangles indicate those in rich clusters .",
    "( most of them are the brightest cluster galaxies . )",
    "it should be emphasized that virgo cluster is not a rich cluster but a poor cluster in which a spatial distribution of galaxies is known to be rather sparse , and color gradients in only a few ellipticals in a cluster as rich as abell 2199 have been studied so far .",
    "we note that a @xmath0 band absolute magnitude of @xmath84 mag and an effective radii of 2.5 kpc roughly correspond to an @xmath1 band magnitude of 15 mag considering a typical color of an elliptical galaxy and an angular size of 3@xmath47 at the distance of the clusters .",
    "figure 6 suggests that , contrary to the galaxies in abell 2199 and abell 2634 , there are no clear trends between the color gradients and galaxy luminosities or effective radii for ellipticals in the less dense environments .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusion by kobayashi & arimoto ( 1999 ) based on the studies of the radial gradients of metal absorption line index .",
    "although there seems to be a marginal trend in the study by peletier et al .",
    "( 1990a ) that for the cluster ellipticals ( open symbols ) , brighter and larger ellipticals have steeper color gradients , it is still worth mentioning that the color gradients in the non - cluster ellipticals ( solid symbols ) do not correlate with their global photometric properties .    in summary , while it is suggested that distribution of color gradient in dense environment such as in abell 2199 is not significantly different from that in sparse environment , there seems to be an environmental dependence in relation between color gradients and global properties of ellipticals : more luminous and larger ellipticals have steeper color gradients in dense environment , but any such trend is clearly weaker in less dense environments .",
    "these results do not fully support the view that ellipticals in rich clusters formed through the monolithic collapse while those in sparse environments formed through galaxy mergers , because the latter ellipticals are expected to have color gradients shallower on average than the formers .",
    "this apparent conflict may be reconciled if star formation and subsequent chemical enrichment induced by the mergers are taken into account .",
    "it is suggested by numerical simulations that if a galaxy merger occurs , a significant fraction of gas in the progenitor galaxies falls into the central regions of the merger remnant and thus star formation activities are also expected to be more active in the inner regions ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ) .",
    "consequently , stellar populations in the inner regions would be more chemically enriched and thus the merger remnant could acquire a metallicity gradient ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) . if this effect compensates the dilution of the metallicity gradient existing in the progenitors by mixing stars during the merger , a resultant metallicity gradient in the merger remnant would not become significantly shallower . nevertheless , it is still difficult to address which is more important , the acquisition or the dilution , to determine a metallicity gradient in a merger remnant , because it is likely to depend on initial condition of galaxy merger .",
    "it is also possible that a galaxy has experienced several mergers before the present time and thus the metallicity gradient is defined by its whole merging history .",
    "it is interesting to point out here that a similar trend to that found in this work has been suggested for a sample of bulges of spiral galaxies . in balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) ,",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 color gradients in 18 nearby spiral bulges were studied .",
    "their sample consists of bulges of spiral galaxies earlier than sc , and barred spirals and dusty spirals are excluded .",
    "they found that for the bulges more luminous than an @xmath1 band absolute magnitude of @xmath87 mag , the bulge luminosities correlate with the color gradients in the sense that more luminous bulges have steeper color gradients .",
    "no clear correlations were found between the bulge color gradients and the total luminosities or any of the parameters related to disk light .",
    "since the @xmath86 color gradients in the bulges vary from @xmath88 mag / dex to @xmath89 mag / dex for an increase of the bulge luminosities by 2 magnitudes , the correlation seems to be quite similar to the trend found in this study both qualitatively and quantitatively , though the cluster ellipticals studied here are @xmath90 magnitude more luminous on average than the bulges .",
    "it is also suggested by balcells & peletier ( 1994 ) that there is a correlation between the bulge color gradients and bulge luminosities for the less luminous bulges ( @xmath91 ) , but it is opposite to that for the more luminous ones : less luminous bulges have steeper color gradients .",
    "although it is unclear in our study whether there is a correlation for the cluster ellipticals in the low luminosity range , our data do not exclude the possibility that there is a discontinuity in the relation around @xmath71 mag .",
    "these common features may suggest that luminous bulges of spiral galaxies have formation histories more similar to ellipticals in rich clusters .",
    "however , once the environmental dependence found in this work for elliptical galaxies is taken into account , it does not seem to be simply explained because spiral galaxies tend to be in sparse environments , while no clear trends between color gradients and galaxy luminosities have been found for ellipticals in sparse environments .",
    "more observational and theoretical works would be necessary to understand what this similarity implies .",
    "we performed @xmath0 and @xmath1 band surface photometry for e / s0 galaxies in abell 2199 and abell 2634 , and studied their @xmath2 color gradients . in order to sample spheroid dominated galaxies , the decomposition of the surface brightness profiles into @xmath38 bulge and exponential disk profiles was performed and the sample selection was based on the @xmath0 band bulge - to - total luminosity ratios .",
    "resultantly , 29 galaxies in abell 2199 and 7 galaxies in abell 2634 were sampled .",
    "we evaluated the seeing effects on the color gradient by simulating with artificial galaxies having various parameters and defined the inner cut - off radius in deriving color gradients to mitigate the effects .",
    "the mean value of the color gradient is estimated to be @xmath4 mag / dex , which can be converted to a metallicity gradient of @xmath92 .",
    "this gradient seems to be consistent with that expected by a recent monolithic collapse model .",
    "we further studied the relations between the @xmath2 color gradients and global properties of the sample galaxies .",
    "it is found that for the galaxies in abell 2199 brighter than @xmath71 mag , which roughly corresponds to @xmath8 at the distance of the cluster , there may be a correlation in the sense that more luminous galaxies have steeper color gradients .",
    "also , for the galaxies with effective radii larger than @xmath9 , which nearly corresponds to @xmath71 mag considering the scaling relation , the galaxies with larger effective radii seem to have steeper color gradients .",
    "the ellipticals in abell 2634 appear to follow the same trends , though the sample is small .",
    "these trends also suggest that elliptical galaxies in rich clusters formed through the monolithic collapse scenario . since this is the first systematic study of color gradients in ellipticals in a rich cluster , it is important to study ellipticals in other rich clusters and to see whether the characteristics of the color gradients found in this study are generally seen or not .",
    "we compared the results with the color gradients in elliptical galaxies in less dense environments using data from the literature .",
    "it is found that no clear trends between color gradient and galaxy luminosity or effective radius are seen , suggesting that elliptical galaxies in sparse environments formed through galaxy mergers , while the distributions of the color gradients seem to be quite similar to those obtained in abell 2199 and abell 2634 .",
    "these results suggest that while distribution of color gradient is almost independent of galaxy environment , there may be an environmental dependence in relation between color gradients and global properties of ellipticals : more luminous and larger ellipticals have steeper color gradients in dense environment , but any such trend is clearly weaker in less dense environments .",
    "this does not fully support the view that ellipticals in rich clusters formed through the monolithic collapse while those in sparse environments formed through galaxy mergers , because the latter ellipticals are expected to have color gradients shallower on average than the formers .",
    "this apparent conflict may be reconciled if we take into account star formation and subsequent chemical enrichment induced by the mergers .",
    "since the chemical enrichment could proceed more in the inner regions of the merger remnant , a metallicity gradient could be newly formed and it may compensate the dilution of the metallicity gradient .",
    "the correlation between the color gradient and the galaxy luminosity ( or the effective radius ) found for the brighter cluster ellipticals can not be seen for the fainter ellipticals ; this may imply the difference of formation process between them , though it should be confirmed by data for the fainter ellipticals with a higher spatial resolution . on the other hand",

    "<S> this apparent conflict may be reconciled by taking into account star formation and subsequent chemical enrichment induced by galaxy merger , which may allow a merger remnant to acquire a metallicity gradient and thus compensate the dilution of the existing metallicity gradients in the progenitors by mixture of stars during the galaxy merger . </S>"
