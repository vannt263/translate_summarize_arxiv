    "an approach to overcome problem ( i ) has been previously developed @xcite .",
    "due to the bi - domain electric nature of cardiac muscle @xcite , every defect in it that can serve as a pinning centre for a vortex , is at the same time an electric inhomogeneity .",

    "this gives the e - pacing period @xmath46 .",
    "thus , all parameters of e - pacing ( @xmath47 , @xmath42 , @xmath45 ) can be set following equations @xmath48 to guarantee that at least one e - pulse hits the vw .",
    "minimum energy for termination of a pinned vortex is achieved when the electric field strength is chosen so that the normalized vulnerable window @xmath49 , where @xmath42 is the number of pacing pulses .",
    "the maximal success rate is achieved when the pacing frequency @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the frequency for which the normalized scanning step @xmath52 . when @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , the scanning step @xmath55 , and the vulnerable window may be missed while scanning , thereby decreasing the success rate . when @xmath56 , so @xmath57 , the scanning step @xmath58 , and not all phases are scanned .",
    "this also decreases the success rate .",
    "what does interaction of vortices change here ?",
    "in cardiac muscle , the fastest vortex entrains slower vortices if there is a normal wave propagation between them . then , only one frequency remains ; this facilitates vortices termination .",
    "but entrainment ceases if the fastest vortex is terminated before the slower vortices , and then the frequency of the system changes ( period increases ) . here ,",
    "two wave scenarios are possible , which we describe for the case of just two vortices with periods @xmath59 and @xmath60 , such that @xmath61 :    1 .   if the periods of the two vortices are not much different , so that @xmath62 , then the pacing is still under - driving , and the slower vortex ( @xmath59 ) can be terminated by e - pacing with same period @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unknownvw ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : scanning]b ) , provided that termination conditions are met for the slower vortex .",
    "2 .   if however the periods of the two vortices are so much different that @xmath63 then the pacing with the same period is no longer under - driving , but over - driving . and overdrive pacing will typically entrain the remaining vortex rather than eliminate it .    for successful termination of fibrillation , the e - pacing period should be increased to a higher value @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 .",
    "thus , vortices can be terminated in any case .",
    "experiments @xcite underestimated the potential of the method since this mechanism was not known yet .      : a free vortex and a defect ( white ) .",

    "below , we describe a mechanism terminating a high frequency free vortex by electric field pacing . numerical and theoretical publications state it is very easy : usual local pacing ( atp ) with frequency higher than a free vortex frequency terminates a free vortex .",
    "it works in experiment and in clinics , but only for low frequency vortices .",
    "classic atp can not terminate vf , can not terminate high frequency rotating waves , including free rotating waves .",
    "waves emitted from a pacing electrode propagate along the whole tissue only for low frequency . for higher frequencies ,",
    "the wenckebach rhythm transformation arrives in a heterogeneous cardiac tissue . in contrast ,",
    "an electric field penetrates everywhere , without frequency limitations , and only requires local heterogeneities to act as virtual electrodes .",
    "this mechanism can be used for terminating a high frequency free vortex .",
    "a free ( not pinned ) vortex can be terminated when its moving core passes not very far ( at distance @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the wave length ) from a defect in the medium , serving as a virtual electrode , fig .  [ fig : freespiral ] ( this illustration uses the same mathematical model for the excitable medium and for the action of the electrical field as in the previous subsection ) .",
    "the success rate increases as distance @xmath73 decreases . a mechanism reliably terminating a free rotating wave was found in 1983 @xcite : waves with a frequency higher than the frequency of a rotating wave , induce its drift and termination on the boundary .",
    "cardiologists used a high - frequency pacing ( anti - tachycardia pacing , atp ) well before the mechanism was understood .",
    "but atp can not terminate high frequency rotating waves .",
    "this fundamental limitation is overcome by the mechanism of a free vortex termination proposed here .",
    "this mechanism depends on wave emission induced from a defect induced by the electric field .",
    "the electric field penetrates everywhere , hence no restriction on its efficacy imposed by the maximal frequency of propagating waves in any part of the cardiac tissue .",
    "an increased amplitude of electric field @xmath74 results in defibrillation .",
    "there is a classical explanation : electric field should be increased to the value where it terminates all propagating waves .",
    "a physical explanation is : the wave emission is induced from a larger number of defects when the electric field is increased @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : edependence]g shows another mechanism : the size of the excited region increases with the electric field , and the duration of the vw increases with it .",
