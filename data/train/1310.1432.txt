    "light double-@xmath3 hypernuclei are exotic few - body systems that provide opportunities to investigate the flavor su(3 ) structure of baryon - baryon interactions in the strangeness @xmath10 channel  @xcite .",
    "they are also expected to have a key role to resolve the long - standing puzzle on the existence of the @xmath11-dibaryon  @xcite , which attracts recent interests triggered by lattice qcd simulations  @xcite . since the seminal experiments on double-@xmath3 hypernuclei of refs .",
    "@xcite , however , there are only a few reports on the observation of double-@xmath3 hypernuclei and , as a result , our understanding on these systems is still very poor . in the kek - e373 experiment",
    "the @xmath12 interaction energy interaction energy @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath7 and @xmath15 are binding energies of the corresponding nuclei .",
    "] inside @xmath16he is measured as @xmath17  mev , which suggests a weakly attractive @xmath12 interaction  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the formation of another double-@xmath3 hypernucleus , @xmath0h , is conjectured in the bnl - ags e906 experiment  @xcite . theoretically , although the first faddeev - yakubovsky calculation showed a negative result  @xcite , subsequent theoretical studies  @xcite predicted the possibility of the @xmath0h bound state based on the phenomenological @xmath12 potentials which can describe the bound state of @xmath16he .    since the stability of double-@xmath3 hypernuclei depends on the @xmath12 interaction , more accurate information on this interaction",
    "is strongly required .",
    "recently , the scattering length @xmath9 of @xmath1-wave @xmath12 scattering is deduced from the @xmath18c(@xmath19 reaction  @xcite , which leads to @xmath20  fm  @xcite , and the data for the au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider  @xcite are analyzed to obtain @xmath21  fm in ref .",
    "these values are consistent with those extracted from the leading order calculations for the @xmath22 baryon - baryon interactions in chiral effective theory  @xcite and in the nijmengen esc04d phenomenological potential model  @xcite . on the other hand , other phenomenological potential model predictions are scattered in values from @xmath23  fm to @xmath24  fm even though such models could explain the existence of the @xmath16he bound state .",
    "the present situation is summarized , for example , in table  i of ref .",
    "this may imply that the parameter space of potential models would be too large to determine unambiguously the parameter values from the currently available experimental data .",
    "in such a situation , it would be worth studying the structure of hypernuclei by employing a very low energy effective field theory ( eft ) which has a low separation scale , a well - defined expansion scheme , and a few parameters to determine .",
    "the methods of eft nowadays become popular in many fields .",
    "( for a review , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . ) in this scheme , a theory is constructed based on a scale which separates low energy and high energy degrees of freedom , and the theory constructed in such a way provides a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the typical scale of the reaction in question and @xmath27 is the large ( or high energy ) scale .",
    "high energy degrees of freedom above @xmath27 are integrated out and their effects are accounted for through the coefficients of contact interactions , so - called low energy constants , in higher order .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the relation between the @xmath0h bound state and the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering below the hypertriton breakup momentum for spin singlet and triplet channels by employing halo / cluster eft at leading order ( lo ) .",
    "in particular , we treat the @xmath0h hypernucleus as a three - body @xmath28 system , where @xmath29 stands for a deuteron .",
    "although the scattering experiment with double-@xmath3 systems is not feasible in near future , a qualitative / theoretical information from the scattering results can be possibly connected to the bound state problem , which makes the main motivation of the present work .    below the hypertriton breakup momentum , we can choose the typical momentum ( @xmath26 ) of the reaction as the @xmath3 particle separation momentum from the hypertriton , which is defined by @xmath30  mev , where @xmath31 is the reduced mass of the @xmath32 system and @xmath15 is the @xmath3 particle separation energy from the hypertriton , @xmath33  mev  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the large ( high momentum ) scale @xmath27 is chosen to be the deuteron binding momentum , @xmath34  mev , where @xmath35 is the nucleon mass and @xmath36 is the deuteron binding energy , @xmath37  mev .",
    "then our expansion parameter is @xmath38 , which supports our expansion scheme .",
    "because the deuteron is not broken up into two nucleons at low momentum below the deuteron binding momentum , we may treat the deuteron field as a cluster field , i.e. , like an elementary field .",
    "the @xmath28 system can form spin singlet and spin triplet states for the @xmath39h channel and we consider only the @xmath1-wave case for the relative orbital angular momentum . for the spin singlet channel of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering ,",
    "we obtain a single integral equation for the scattering amplitude , which is parameterized by the effective range parameters of the @xmath1-wave @xmath3-@xmath29 scattering in the hypertriton channel , namely , the scattering length @xmath40 ( or equivalently the hypertriton binding momentum @xmath41 ) and the effective range @xmath42 .",
    "the integral is regularized by introducing a sharp momentum cutoff @xmath4 in the integral equation .",
    "we find that when the cutoff @xmath4 is larger than @xmath27 , there is no cutoff dependence in the results , which implies that the system is insensitive to the short range mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this then suggests that introducing a three - body contact interaction at lo is not necessary .",
    "in addition , here we employ the standard kaplan - savage - wise ( ksw ) counting rules  @xcite , where the effective range , @xmath42 , is treated as a higher order term .",
    "this shows that the scattering length @xmath43 and the phase shift @xmath44 of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering are well controlled by @xmath41 .    on the other hand , for the spin triplet channel ,",
    "coupled integral equations are obtained for the scattering amplitudes . because of spin statistics these equations consist of two cluster channels .",
    "one is the hypertriton-@xmath3 channel of spin-1 and the other is the deuteron and double-@xmath3 system , where we assume that the double-@xmath3 is described by the @xmath12-dibaryon state and the components in the cluster states are in relative @xmath1-wave .",
    "we find that the coupled integral equations show a sensitivity to the cutoff @xmath4 .",
    "thus , as in the case of three - nucleon system in the triton channel within pionless eft  @xcite , a three - body contact interaction needs to be introduced in order to make the results cutoff - independent .",
    "in addition , within the standard ksw counting rules  @xcite the dressed composite propagators of the hypertriton for the @xmath3-@xmath29 composite state and of the dibaryon for two @xmath3 particles in @xmath45 state are expanded in terms of the effective range parameters .",
    "thus the coupled integral equations are represented in terms of only four parameters at lo , namely , @xmath41 , @xmath9 , the coupling of the three - body contact interaction @xmath6 , and the cutoff @xmath4 . unlike the effective range parameters , however , there are no experimental data to constrain @xmath6 for @xmath39h .    because of the paucity of empirical information to constrain the low energy constants it is very hard to draw a robust prediction on the existence of the bound state in the @xmath39h channel . therefore , instead of tackling the problem on the existence of bound states we investigate the effect of the contact term in the @xmath39h system . for this purpose",
    "we consider two cases . in the first case",
    ", we do not include the contact interaction by setting @xmath46 .",
    "then the system is found to have a large negative scattering length at @xmath47 , which may imply the formation of a quasi - bound state .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath4 is sent to the asymptotic limit , @xmath48 , we find that a bound state arises in the system .    in the second case , we turn on the contact interaction . to constrain the value of @xmath49",
    ", we employ the results of the potential model calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite and determine @xmath49 by using the computed double-@xmath3 separation energy @xmath7 of @xmath50h for given values of @xmath9 . then we find that the renormalized @xmath6 exhibits so - called the limit - cycle when @xmath4 is sent to the asymptotic limit . in the present work , we also calculate @xmath7 as a function of @xmath9 for a fixed @xmath49 and a correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath51 as well , where @xmath52 is the scattering length of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering in the spin triplet channel at lo .",
    "we find that the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath7 is quite sensitive to the value of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , @xmath7 is found to be almost insensitive to @xmath9 when @xmath53 . on the other hand , the reported @xmath9-dependence of @xmath7 in the potential model calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite is recovered when @xmath54 . in the present work",
    ", we will investigate the implications of the choice on the cutoff @xmath4 and the @xmath9- and @xmath4-dependence of the properties of @xmath39h system in the cluster theory .",

    "in the present work , we studied the @xmath0h bound state and @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering for spin singlet and triplet channels below the hypertriton breakup momentum in halo eft at lo by treating the @xmath0h system as a three - body @xmath218 cluster system . in this approach ,",
    "the hypertriton breakup momentum @xmath219  mev is chosen to be the typical scale @xmath26 of the theory , whereas the deuteron binding momentum @xmath220  mev to be the high momentum scale @xmath27 .",
    "thus , in such a small typical momentum scale , the deuteron is not broken into two nucleons , which justifies the treatment of the deuteron field as a cluster ( elementary ) field .",
    "furthermore , our expansion parameter is @xmath221 .    for the spin singlet channel of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering ,",
    "the amplitude is nearly independent of the cutoff , thus there is no need to introduce the three - body contact interaction at lo .",
    "consequently , the integral equation at lo is well described by one effective range parameter , @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to the value of the scattering length @xmath43 of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering for the spin singlet channel as @xmath222  fm .",
    "we also found no bound state in this channel at lo .",
    "for the spin triplet channel of the @xmath1-wave scattering of hypertriton and @xmath3 , the scattering amplitudes are obtained through two coupled integral equations .",
    "we find that when the cutoff parameter @xmath4 is close to the asymptotic limit , the coupling of the three - body contact interaction , i.e. , @xmath49 , exhibits the limit - cycle , and thus the three - body contact interaction should be included in the spin triplet channel .",
    "consequently the coupled integral equations are represented by four parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 can be fixed from the @xmath3 separation energy of the hypertriton and that of @xmath9 may be fixed from other experiments or possibly lattice qcd simulations . however , there is no available experimental data to constrain the value of @xmath49 .",
    "when we do not introduce @xmath223 in the theory , we obtain @xmath224  fm with @xmath47 .",
    "this may imply that the hypertriton-@xmath3 interaction is attractive but it is not strong enough to form a bound state .",
    "thus , if the @xmath39h bound state is formed , the main binding mechanism should stem from the mechanisms of high momentum region , which is represented by the coupling @xmath6 in the present approach .",
    "therefore , to take into account this effect , we assume a formation of the @xmath39h bound state and employ the results of the potential model calculations for the two-@xmath3 separation energy @xmath7 for several values of @xmath9 to constrain the value of @xmath49 . using the fixed @xmath6",
    "we then calculate @xmath7 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "we also calculate the correlations between @xmath7 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the scattering length of the @xmath1-wave hypertriton-@xmath3 scattering for spin triplet channel .    as can be notably seen in the numerical results for the correlation between @xmath7 and @xmath9 as given in fig .",
    "[ fig;bllvsall ] , when the cutoff is chosen to be the large scale of the theory , i.e. , @xmath53 , @xmath7 is insensitive to the value of @xmath9 .",
    "but , when @xmath4 is larger than @xmath27 , say @xmath225 , @xmath7 is sensitive to @xmath9 , which gives results similar to the potential model predictions .",
    "this would be a natural consequence because @xmath226 is a quantity of a large scale , @xmath227  mev , compared to the typical scale of the system , @xmath228  mev .",
    "in addition , the dynamics that exhibits the sensitivity to the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction above @xmath47 is integrated out and its effect in high momentum is embedded in the contact interaction @xmath49 .",
    "meanwhile , although the deuteron cluster theory with a large cutoff value such as @xmath54 can reproduce the @xmath9-dependence of @xmath7 similar to the potential model predictions , this would be inconsistent with the construction principles of eft and it will miss the important dynamic mechanisms as discussed before .",
    "therefore , the @xmath9-sensitivities in the physical observables for the @xmath39h hypernucleus , such as @xmath7 , inevitably depend on the scale of the theory .",
    "investigating the @xmath9-sensitivity in more detail at another scale in the @xmath229h system requires to work with a non - cluster theory such as the pionless theory for four - body systems  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , we still do not have enough information to judge whether the @xmath39h system is bound or not .",
    "this causes the difficulty for studying the energy levels of the @xmath39h hypernucleus within eft since the value of the contact interaction @xmath49 can not be constrained by other information .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to apply this approach to other double-@xmath3 hypernuclei , where some empirical data are available such as the @xmath16he system .",
    "the @xmath16he hypernucleus as a @xmath230 three - body cluster system can be investigated in the scheme of eft . because the binding energy , or equivalently the two-@xmath3 separation energy , of @xmath231he is experimentally known , it can be used to determine the strength of the three - body contact interaction in the @xmath232 system .",
    "moreover , because the @xmath233 particle is more tightly bound than the deuteron , the high momentum scale of the cluster theory becomes larger than @xmath27 of the present work .",
    "therefore , the study of @xmath231he in halo / cluster eft can provide another tool to study @xmath204 in the exotic systems and shed light on our understanding of strong interactions in the strangeness sector .",
