    "the hubble deep fields ( hdfs ) are rich sources of data on cosmology and the evolution of galaxies .",
    "the large number of observations at many different wavelengths make the northern hdf ( nhdf ) particularly useful .",
    "the nhdf is the only hdf that has complete coverage with both wfpc2 and nicmos .",
    "the nicmos coverage , however , is not to the same depth as the wfpc2 due to the smaller area of the nicmos camera  3 .",
    "this is somewhat compensated for by the red nature of evolved galaxies and the redshift of visible light into the infrared bands for young blue galaxies",
    ".    this work studies the star formation history in the nhdf and is an extension of a similar study utilizing the smaller nicmos deep field @xcite ( hereinafter tws ) .",
    "the increased area and number of galaxies greatly improves the statistical significance of the results over tws .",
    "shallower coverage , however , increases the photometric error , making it comparable or dominant over the large scale structure error which decreased due to the larger field .",
    "other researchers , @xcite have utilized the same data set , plus additional ground based data to investigate star formation history in the nhdf .",
    "our analysis differs significantly from those studies by including extinction in the sed templates used to determine the photometric redshifts .",
    "this produces results quite different from @xcite who do not include extinction .",
    "contrary to @xcite we find that the star formation rate ( sfr ) is essentially constant in the epoch from z = 1 to z = 6 and that this rate is significantly larger than the present day sfr @xcite , consistent with the results presented in tws .",
    "observations utilized in this study are all from the hubble space telescope ( hst ) archives .",
    "the first set is the processed wfpc2 images of the nhdf produced by @xcite .",
    "the second set is the archival data from the nicmos survey of the entire nhdf by @xcite .",
    "the nicmos f110w and f160w data were reprocessed as described in ",
    "[ sec - dr ] .",
    "only the areas corresponding to the three wide field wfpc2 chips are used since the wfpc2 pc chip images have substantially different signal to noise statistics .",
    "nicmos deep nhdf images and data reductions from @xcite and tws are used in the error analysis .",
    "all nicmos images were taken in the sparse64 mode with 24 samples after the first read and integration times of 1344 seconds .",
    "images at 8 positions completely covered the nhdf . at each position",
    "9 images were taken in a dithered pattern . the 8 positions with 9 dither points in the f110w and f160w filters required 144 exposures .",
    "the data reduction procedures are almost identical to the procedures described in @xcite and tws . for this reason",
    "they will only be briefly outlined except where there are differences .",
    "the wfpc2 images were not altered from the version 2 images available in the hst archives .",
    "the nicmos images , however , were reduced from the raw images obtained in the hst cycle 7 program 7817 by mark dickinson .",
    "the images were examined for effects of cosmic ray persistence from saa passages and 17 of the 144 images were rejected .",
    "the background flux was removed by taking the median of the images in each filter that were not affected by cosmic ray persistence and subtracting it from each image .",
    "the 9 dithered images for each of the 8 positions were combined using the standard drizzle procedures with 0.1 arc second pixels , one half the linear size of the nicmos camera  3 pixels .",
    "the idl procedure idp3 @xcite produced a mosaic of the 8 images .",
    "idp3 also reduced the wfpc images to the nicmos resolution with a bi - cubic spline interpolation and aligned them with the nicmos mosaic .",
    "inspection of the images showed regions of increased noise at the boundaries between images .",
    "these areas were masked out as shown in figure  [ fig - mask ] . since",
    "this study is primarily a statistical study , the small amount of masked area does not affect the conclusions .",
    "source positions were found using the method of @xcite as described in tws .",
    "a gaussian fit to the histogram of pixel values determined the global variance of the image mosaic in each filter .",
    "the histogram is dominated by the background noise with true sources creating a deviation from the gaussian fit at large positive values .",
    "the 1 @xmath0 noise levels in both the f110w and f160w nicmos filters are @xmath1 adus per second",
    ". for comparison the nicmos deep field has a 1 @xmath0 noise level of @xmath2 adus per second .",
    "@xmath1 adus per second corresponds to @xmath3 janskys .",
    "the drizzling procedure , however , introduces correlation , therefore , the true noise level is about 1.6 times larger than the measured gaussian noise .",
    "the szalay source identification procedure requires images with a local variance of one .",
    "the local variances for the f110w and f160w fields were found by drizzling and mosaicing the flat fields of the two filters in exactly the same way as the images .",
    "this accounts for differences in sensitivity over the area of the nicmos camera 3 detector .",
    "the flats have a median of 1 , therefore , the variance images also have a median of 1 .",
    "the ratio of the imaged fields to the variance image was scaled to the average variance creating a local variance of 1 .",
    "the variance in the wfpc filters was assumed constant across the field .",
    "this procedure differs slightly from the procedure used in tws .",
    "the threshold value of the szalay r parameter , @xmath4 , was set to 4.5 , higher than the 2.3 value used in tws but more appropriate for the six dimensional @xmath5 analysis of the combined wfpc and nicmos fluxes .",
    "unlike tws all six fluxes are included in the szalay procedure to insure that small blue galaxies with little infrared flux are not missed in the source extraction . the source selection criterion for determining the star formation history (   [ ssec - ssc ] ) , however , does discriminate against galaxies with no f110w or f160w flux .",
    "figure  [ fig - r ] shows the distribution of r image pixels .",
    "all pixels with r values higher than or equal to 4.5 are considered legitimate source pixels .",
    "pixels with r values less than 4.5 are assigned random values with average values @xmath6 below the valid pixels .",
    "this forces the source extraction program to only consider pixels chosen by the szalay procedure .",
    "the source extraction program crashes if all non - valid pixels are set to zero .",
    "the source extraction program sextractor ( se ) @xcite extracts the sources in two passes .",
    "the first pass on the r has the extraction threshold set at 4.0 , selecting all valid pixels . as in tws",
    "the detect minarea parameter is set to 3 so a true source must have 3 contiguous valid pixels .",
    "the source positions , except for the contiguous area criterion are , therefore , determined by the szalay procedure , _ not by se_. se then runs again on the six photometric images in a mode that extracts sources in the pixel pattern determined by the first pass .",
    "run in this manner , se does not produce daughter objects .",
    "sources which have several components may be broken into individual objects by this process .",
    "although listed as separate objects in the catalog the star formation history is unaffected as long as the calculated photometric redshift is the same for both components . in some cases a separate listing for two components",
    "is an advantage , allowing different extinctions for different components .",
    "  [ ssec - ssc ] discusses additional criteria for final source selection .",
    "the phot - apertures parameter in the se configuration file was set to 6 , 10 , 15 to produce 0.6@xmath7 , 1.0@xmath7 , and 1.5@xmath7 diameter aperture fluxes .",
    "the photometric , redshift , extinction and sed calculations use the 0.6@xmath7 aperture fluxes .",
    "the total flux for determining the sfr is found by summing all of the pixels identified by the szalay procedure as belonging to a single source .",
    "the basic procedure for photometric redshift , extinction and sed determination is a @xmath5 comparison of the observed fluxes in the six bands to fluxes calculated from numerically redshifted and extincted seds .",
    "as described in tws we draw our templates from three sources .",
    "the first source is the four observed seds of @xcite utilized by several authors .",
    "these galaxy seds have been corrected for galactic extinction but not for extinction in the galaxies themselves .",
    "the galaxies , however , were selected on the basis of their very low internal extinction .",
    "the unreddened sed of the set of mean seds of @xcite provides an additional observed active star - forming galaxy template ( @xcite ) .",
    "a final and even hotter template is a 50 million year old continuous star formation sed calculated from the bruzual and charlot models ( @xcite ) with a salpeter imf and solar metallicity .",
    "this theoretical sed does not have emission lines , therefore we have added h@xmath8 , ( o[iii]+ h@xmath9 ) and o[ii ] emission lines by scaling up the lines from the calzetti sed by the ratio of the uv fluxes in the calzetti and bruzual  charlot seds .",
    "template 6 is substantially bluer than the calzetti sed .",
    "extinction is calculated from the starburst and star forming galaxy optimized obscuration law of @xcite .",
    "since the primary purpose of this paper is a determination of the star formation rate it is appropriate to utilize an extinction law determined from star forming galaxies .",
    "the absorption due to extragalactic neutral hydrogen is calculated from an updated version of the formulation of @xcite .",
    "the calculated fluxes are then interpolated between the 6 seds to produce 51 different sed fluxes for each redshift and extinction point .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in tws .",
    "the grid for the @xmath5 analysis includes 100 different redshifts between 0 and 8 , 15 different extinctions between e(b - v ) of 0 to 1.0 and 51 different interpolated template types for a total of @xmath10 choices .",
    "the resulting redshifts , extinctions and seds are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the earliest sed has a value of 1.0 incremented by 0.1 to the latest sed of 6.0 .",
    "integer values refer to the 6 basic sed templates .",
    "extinctions in e(b - v ) are incremented by 0.02 from 0 to 0.1 and by .1 from 0.1 to 1.0 , the maximum used in the analysis .",
    "the @xmath5 procedure is identical to tws except that negative fluxes are not replaced by zero .",
    "the technique minimizes the @xmath5 residuals between the observed fluxes and those predicted by the numerically redshifted , extincted and lyman absorption attenuated seds .",
    "it alters the usual error term in the denominator by adding a second term proportional to the measured flux .",
    "the @xmath5 residual is    @xmath11    the index  i refers to the six fluxes , @xmath12 is the measured flux and @xmath13 is the flux predicted by a template at a redshift of z and extinction e(b - v ) = e. since this is not a formal @xmath5 calculation the quantitative probabilities associated with @xmath5 values are not strictly valid .",
    "the normalization constant a minimizes @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15    the limit of the expression at very low flux levels is the standard form with the formal background , @xmath0 , dominating the denominator and at high flux levels it is the flux difference between the observations and the model divided by 10@xmath16 of the flux instead of the @xmath0 . at high flux levels the errors in the fit are proportional to flux since the dominate errors are intra - pixel sensitivity variations and systematic flux errors .",
    "the accuracy of the nicmos flux levels may be better than this .",
    "it is estimated to be 4 - 5@xmath16 for this level of dithering but the output does not appear to strongly depend on the precise coefficient of the flux in the denominator of equation (  [ eq : chisq ] ) .",
    "photometric redshifts have gained a reasonable reputation for accuracy , particularly at high redshifts where the clear signature of the lyman break is easy to observe .",
    "two tests of the photometric redshifts derived in this work are comparison to available spectroscopic nhdf redshifts and comparison with previous nhdf photometric redshifts ( tws , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the primary source of spectroscopic redshifts is @xcite , enhanced and modified by @xcite .",
    "the small reductions in the field area described in   [ sec - obs ] reduces the number of comparison redshifts to 135 .",
    "figure  [ fig - zcomp ] shows the results of the comparison .",
    "the standard deviation is 0.29 in redshift , however , it is not constant with redshift .",
    "most of the error occurs in the redshift range between 0 and 2 , as is expected , since the prominent lyman break does not appear in our data for that range .",
    "note that galaxies in the redshift range between 0 and 0.5 are not used in this study .",
    "catastrophic redshift errors , errors of more than 0.5 in redshift , are overploted with squares in figure  [ fig - zcomp ] .",
    "analysis of the 11 catastrophic failures reveals three basic types of failures .",
    "the first type is where there is no clear minimum in the @xmath5 value along the range of redshifts , extinctions or sed templates .",
    "these are characterized by a steadily decreasing @xmath5 value with a parameter , such as template , until the end of the parameter space is reached .",
    "this failure of the parameters to span the space of galaxy types is seen in 6 galaxies .",
    "the second category contains 5 galaxies that are most probably superpositions of two galaxies that have not been separated by the se source extraction process .",
    "both galaxies are contained in the lris 1@xmath7 slit width used in the spectroscopic observations @xcite . in this case",
    "the spectroscopic redshift would be determined by the galaxy with the most prominent spectral features while the photometric redshift would be most influenced by the galaxy with the highest continuum level .",
    "the third failure in 2 galaxies is an apparent mild degeneracy in parameters which tends to favor a redshift of about 0.5 for galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between 0.5 and 1.0 .",
    "these galaxies appear to be well fit at the correct redshift with an intermediate sed and low value of extinction or at a redshift of @xmath17.5 with a very hot template and a high value of extinction .",
    "this degeneracy creates a pile up of galaxies at redshifts of 0.48 and 0.56 .",
    "examination of the photometric redshifts for these sources where the extinction is forced to be zero did not give statistically better fits except in the extreme cases such as those in table  [ tab - err ] .",
    "this type of error can reduce the calculated sfr in the redshift 0.5 to 1.5 bin by moving some sources out of the bin to a redshift of 0.48 or reducing the calculated uv flux for a source that has been moved to a lower redshift erroneously .",
    "this would make the sfr for redshift a lower limit , subject to other errors .",
    "note that some galaxies have multiple failure modes so that the number of failures listed is larger than the number of failed galaxies .",
    "table  [ tab - err ] lists the 11 galaxies with redshift errors larger than 0.5 along with their parameters and the probable cause of the error .",
    "the general conclusion is that the photometric redshifts are quite adequate for statistical studies but can be subject to significant errors for individual galaxies .",
    "the comparison between the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts is dominated by low redshift fairly bright galaxies except for the few faint , high redshift galaxies that have spectroscopic redshifts through very long spectroscopic observations on the largest ground based telescopes .",
    "it might be expected that the agreement on bright sources may be better than for the more numerous faint galaxies .",
    "one test is a comparison between the photometric redshifts obtained in the deep nicmos field ( tws ) with those found in this study .",
    "the nicmos f110w and f160w images are completely independent between the two data sets while the wfpc2 image are in common except that kfocas was used for source extraction in tws and se is used here .",
    "the comparison primarily determines the differences introduced by noise in the f110w and f160w images .",
    "redshifts from the nicmos deep nhdf images should be more accurate than the redshifts from the present study due to the higher signal to noise of the deep images .",
    "a total of 283 galaxies in the deep images also appear as legitimate galaxies in this set of images .",
    "figure  [ fig - zhist ] shows a histogram of the differences in the redshifts between the deep and present images .",
    "the differences are peaked at zero as expected but do not appear to be a gaussian distribution away from the peak .",
    "the differences are reasonably equally distributed between positive and negative values with a slight skew toward negative values ( the present redshift higher than the deep redshift ) . the percentage of `` catastrophic failures '' , a difference greater than 0.5 , is @xmath18 .",
    "some of the failures create large differences in redshift .",
    "examination of some cases with large differences reveals significant differences in either the f110w or f160w flux .",
    "as expected there is little variation in the wfpc2 fluxes measured by kfocas and sextractor .",
    "the @xmath18 significant redshift error from this comparison is higher than the @xmath19 error found from the spectroscopic redshift comparison . in the final error analysis",
    "we will assume that @xmath18 of the galaxies have redshift errors that are randomly distributed up to a maximum of 4 .",
    "there have been several other determinations of photometric redshift in the nhdf but only two @xcite have readily accessible catalogs of redshift and object position .",
    "figure  [ fig - zlwcomp ] shows the comparison between this work and the redshifts obtained by the two groups .",
    "coincidence of objects was determined by position correspondence within 0.3@xmath7 .",
    "the redshifts of both previous studies are offset to larger redshifts than this study .",
    "this effect is most probably due to both groups not correcting for extinction . without extinction the only mechanism to make a galaxy redder is to redshift it or choose an earlier template",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the individual sources , ordered by ra , that satisfy the criteria listed in  [ ssec - ssc ] .",
    "column 1 gives the nicmos identification number .",
    "column 2 is the wfpc2 identification number of the galaxy from @xcite if there is positional coincidence within @xmath20 .",
    "columns 3 and 4 are the the redshift and extinction . column 5 contains the sfr in solar masses per year as determined in   [ sec - dsfr ] .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy is in column 6 .",
    "the flux of a galaxy is obtained by integrating over the unextincted selected template scaled by the factor a from equation (  [ eq : a ] ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity then follows from the redshift and our adopted cosmology .",
    "the fraction of the luminosity that is extincted and therefore goes into far infrared flux is in column 7 followed by the calculated 6 , 15 and 850 @xmath21 flux ( mjy ) in columns 8 , 9 and 10 for comparison with measured iso and scuba fluxes (   [ sec - ir ] ) .",
    "the luminosities , iso fluxes and scuba fluxes of galaxies with a redshift of zero are all set to zero .",
    "columns 11 and 12 give the template number t of the best fit , and the modified @xmath5 value of the fit from equation  [ eq : chisq ] .",
    "it should be noted that the distribution of the modified @xmath5 values will not rigorously follow a true @xmath5 distribution .",
    "the values are provided to give a qualitative indication of the relative goodness of fit for the best fit values of redshift , template type and e(b - v ) .",
    "column 13 has the total f160w ab magnitude , determined by adding all of the pixels designated by se as part of an object , followed by the 0.6 aperture f160w magnitude ( ap . mag ) in column 14 .",
    "note that variations in local background as interpreted by se can result in an aperture magnitude brighter than a total magnitude for faint galaxies .",
    "if no f160w magnitude is listed the object had a zero or negative measured f160w flux .",
    "columns 15 and 16 are the right ascension and declination positions of the object .",
    "the ra listing contains only seconds and the dec listing only minutes and seconds .",
    "12@xmath22 36@xmath23 should be added to the ra and 62@xmath24 to the dec .",
    "note that a few sources have ra values of 12@xmath22 37@xmath23 plus seconds .",
    "these sources are found at the end of the catalog with seconds values between 0 and 1.2 .",
    "data reduction is performed on all sources detected by the szalay procedure .",
    "additional criteria for source selection are introduced before sources appear in the catalog of objects used for determining the star formation history .",
    "first all sources that are known stars are rejected .",
    "next all objects that are too near the edge of the image to insure that no flux is lost are rejected .",
    "this step uses the se internal flags and visual inspection of the image .",
    "next a list of suspect objects are rejected from a visual inspection of the images .",
    "these include objects with significant overlap that have been counted as a single object by se and stellar diffraction spikes that were counted as objects .",
    "next all objects with se internal flags of 16 or greater , indicating that the photometric aperture was corrupted by some means , are rejected .",
    "next is a criterion that all valid sources must have a signal to noise of 3.5 or greater in one band or a signal to noise of 2.5 or greater in two bands .",
    "finally an accepted source is required to have a flux greater than @xmath1 adus per second in both the f110w and f160w bands .",
    "all sources that meet these criteria are included in the catalog but only sources with redshifts between 0.5 and 6.5 are used in the star formation history analysis .",
    "two other comments are in order on source selection . at this point , for the small number of objects that have known redshifts , the photometric redshift is replaced by the spectroscopic redshift in the analysis procedures .",
    "second the bright galaxy nhdf 3 - 610 is rejected from the analysis due to impingment of the diffraction spike from the adjacent star and a clear overlap with another galaxy .",
    "for this reason , even though it is quite bright , it does not appear in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - hmag ] shows the distribution of f160w magnitudes with redshift and the calculated tracks of an early , a late , and an extincted late l@xmath25 galaxy .",
    "the early galaxy is template 1.0 , the late galaxy template 6.0 and the extincted late galaxy is template 6.0 with an extinction of e(b - v ) = 0.2 .",
    "the sources are color coded with the earliest type galaxy deep red and the latest galaxy deep blue as indicated by the legend on the figure . as expected the majority of the early type galaxies lie at low redshift with some intermediate type galaxies up to redshifts of five .",
    "the majority of galaxies have template numbers between 5 and 6 .    particularly at low values",
    ", there is apparent redshift banding .",
    "the band at zero redshift is due to galaxies with @xmath5 values that were still falling as they approached zero redshift , indicating that the were not matched by any of the galaxy templates .",
    "the band at redshift 0.5 does correspond to an over density observed in the spectroscopic redshift analysis of @xcite which also sees a small over density at a redshift of 1 .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the banding in figure  [ fig - hmag ] as sheets or nodes in large scale structure encountered by the pencil beam of the nhdf but the redshift analysis in   [ s - pres ] does not seem to warrant that interpretation .",
    "this is particularly true for the band at 0.5 which may be due to the effect discussed in ",
    "[ ss - csr ] .",
    "investigation of the significance of the banding will be deferred to a later paper .",
    "most of the galaxies in figure  [ fig - hmag ] fall above the lines of the l@xmath25 ( @xmath26 l@xmath27 ) galaxy tracks . past a redshift of @xmath173",
    "there are several galaxies that lie significantly below the l@xmath25 galaxy line .",
    "this is expected since there certainly are galaxies brighter the l@xmath25 .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether these galaxies have non - physical parameters and whether their position in the diagram is due to a bad fit with the models .",
    "[ fig - fits ] shows the fit between the observed fluxes of the 9 galaxies that most exceed l@xmath25 and the best fit fluxes from the photometric redshift program . in all cases",
    "the fit is excellent , therefore , their position in the diagram is not due to a bad fit .",
    "table  [ tab - lstar ] gives a summary of the properties of the nine sources .",
    "although all but one galaxy has the luminosity of a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) , the low extinction does not re - emit a large enough fraction of the luminosity to put them in that category .",
    "all but 2 galaxies fall in the top 50 most luminous galaxies in the field but none of them are in the top 10 .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the physical properties of the galaxies are realistic and that there is no reason to exclude them as legitimate sources based on non - physical parameters .",
    "note that 398.0 and 410.0 are probably two parts of the same galaxy .",
    "their photometric redshifts of 3.04 and 2.96 are similar but not exactly the same .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift for the the galaxy is 2.799 , close to the photometric redshift .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift is the redshift used in calculating the luminosity for source 410 .",
    "if the spectroscopic redshift for source 410 is also the proper redshift for source 398 , the 398 luminosity should be reduced by a factor of 0.74 .",
    "there are three sources without equivalent wfpc2 identifications .",
    "source 398 is an extension of source 410 identified as wfpc2 4 - 555.1 .",
    "the closest wfpc2 source to 398 is actually 4 - 555.11 which is 0.32@xmath7 away , just beyond our association radius of 0.3@xmath7 .",
    "similarly the closest wfpc sources for 1630 and 1636 are 3 - 367.0 ( 0.33@xmath7 ) and 3 - 839 ( 0.40@xmath7 ) .",
    "although not listed in table  [ tab1],the identifications are listed in table  [ tab - lstar ] since inspection of the images clearly indicates that they are the proper associations .",
    "it is often the case that the f160w center of a galaxy is offset from the optical position .",
    "the f160w position is more representative of the underlying stellar distribution while the optical position measures rest frame uv star formation activity .",
    "as in tws the sfr is determined from the broad band 1500 @xmath28 flux relation given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath29    the value of the uv flux is determined from the 1500 @xmath28 flux of the _ unextincted _ template found in the @xmath5 analysis averaged over a 200 @xmath28 band centered on 1500 @xmath28 .",
    "the reshift and the normalization factor a ( equation  [ eq : a ] ) set the absolute 1500 @xmath28 flux .",
    "this procedure provides the extinction corrected 1500 @xmath28 flux for the sfr calculation .",
    "it is obviously a simplification to assume a single extinction for a whole galaxy but it is clearly better than assuming a single average extinction for all galaxies or no extinction at all . a much more extensive discussion of the extinction is presented in tws and it is not repeated here .    rather than using the isophotal or total flux values returned by se , the flux in each band is computed as the sum of the flux from each pixel that the szalay procedure and se determine is part of an object . the sfr computed with the a value determined from the @xmath30 aperture is then multiplied by the ratio of the total flux to the aperture flux to give the values reported in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the sum of the sfrs in table  [ tab1 ] gives the observed sfr in the appropriate redshift bins . at high",
    "redshift the observed sfr is significantly below the actual sfr due to surface brightness dimming .",
    "the correction for this effect , using the extinction corrected star formation rate per pixel is described in ",
    "[ sec - sbd ] .",
    "it is well known that surface brightness dimming at high redshifts limits the number as well as the extent of galaxies that are detected , creating errors in the measured sfr . in tws",
    "we used the star formation intensity distribution function @xcite to correct for star formation missed due to surface brightness dimming .",
    "@xcite has also used the distribution to correct for missed star formation but did not use a distribution derived from extinction corrected uv fluxes .",
    "the star formation intensity x is defined as the sfr in solar masses per year per _ proper _ square kiloparsec .",
    "the intensity is calculated for each pixel that is part of a galaxy . within a given redshift interval the distribution function , h(x ) ,",
    "is defined as the sum of all the proper areas in a interval of specific intensity , divided by the interval and by the comoving volume in cubic megaparsecs defined by the field and redshift interval @xcite .",

    "the smoothed curve is matched to the high intensity portion of the distribution by simply moving the smoothed distribution up or down in the log - log plot .",
    "it is clear that the smoothed curve for the uncorrected distribution does not match well at higher redshifts .",
    "this is discussed further in   [ ssec - val ] but for now we will concentrate only on the extinction corrected distribution .",
    "the deviation of the observed data from the smoothed distribution in the lower panels shows the effect of surface brightness dimming . as in tws",
    "we correct for surface brightness dimming by integrating equation([eq : hxsfr ] ) over the observed data where the smoothed function matches the data and then over the smoothed function ( adjusted in height ) when the observations fall below the curve .",
    "note that the integral reaches 59% of its total value at @xmath32 and 94% of its total value at @xmath33 .",
    "  [ ssec - val ] discusses the validity of the correction .",
    "table  [ tab - sfr ] shows the sfr at each stage of correction .",
    "the second column gives the rate with no correction for either extinction or surface brightness dimming .",
    "the third column shows the sfr after correction for extinction only and the fourth column shows the sfr after correction for both extinction and surface brightness dimming . at low redshifts",
    "extinction is the dominant correction while at high redshifts extinction and surface brightness dimming are comparable .",
    "all of the calculations without extinction correction are made from the output of the @xmath5 photometric redshift program with the extinction held to zero . in some cases this alters the photometric redshift since the degree of freedom to redden a galaxy by extinction is removed .",
    "this is the cause of the odd case at redshift 4 where the extinction corrected sfr is less than the uncorrected sfr .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of a selection function in conjunction with the star formation intensity distribution function h(x ) .",
    "the selection function is the angular area over which a parameter at a given depth can be detected .",
    "the maximum angular area is the total area of the observation . at some depth of a parameter such as flux",
    ", the area goes to zero when it becomes undetectable .",
    "the parameter used in @xcite and here is the star formation intensity x. the main reason for introducing this concept is the variance in sensitivity of the nicmos camera 3 in different regions of the detector .",
    "the sensitivity varies by a factor of 3 from maximum to minimum .",
    "the star formation intensity is a function of redshift , sed , extinction , and flux , therefore , each pixel included in h(x ) at a specific x may have a different selection function depending on the values of the parameters . given the criterion of 3.5 sigma detection in a flux band for 3 contiguous pixels the selection function determines for each source pixel the percentage of the field area where the source could be detected .",
    "the star formation intensity distribution function program then corrects the area of each pixel by the inverse of the selection function .",
    "the maximum allowed correction is a factor of 10 to prevent marginal detections from dominating the distribution function . in practice",
    "only a small percentage of pixels have selection functions less than 100% .",
    "initially in tws the star formation intensity distribution was treated strictly empirically with no physical motivation .",
    "the identical match of the smoothed distribution derived here from largely independent data is further empirical confirmation of the distribution as is the excellent match at high sfr intensities at higher redshifts .",
    "@xcite , however , provides a physical motivation by showing that the distribution is a natural consequence of the schmidt law , the majority of star formation in occurring in exponential disks , and a schechter distribution of galaxy masses .",
    "it also showed that effects of a smaller characteristic mass and a smaller average radius of the exponential disk at higher redshift have opposite effects on the shape of the distribution leading to a generally invariant distribution .",
    "although we lack detailed knowledge of the changes of characteristic mass and exponential disk radius with redshift , the assumption of an invariant distribution appears to be justified .",
    "even if the surface brightness dimming corrections in table  [ tab - sfr ] varied by 30% the error would be small compared to the errors from other effects such as photometric error and large scale structure .",
    "@xcite also utilized the star formation intensity distribution function to correct for surface brightness dimming but found a sfr that steadily increases from the present day to high values at a redshift of 8 , in contrast to the essentially steady star formation rate between a redshift of 1 and 6 as presented in   [ sec - sfh ] .",
    "only the sfr in the common ground of redshifts will be discussed in the following comments .",
    "the comparison will be with the rates found from scaling the h(x ) distribution vertically in @xcite since that is the technique used in this paper .",
    "the critical difference between the technique applied here versus @xcite is that this work uses the extinction corrected distribution where as @xcite use the distribution that is uncorrected for extinction .",
    "@xcite refer to this rate as the unobscured rate . at a redshift of 1",
    "they find a sfr of @xmath34 per mpc@xmath35 whereas the value in this work is @xmath36 per mpc@xmath35 .",
    "this is simply understood as the difference between correcting for extinction and not correcting for extinction . at a redshift of 4",
    "@xcite find a rate of @xmath37 per mpc@xmath35 comparable to our value of 0.1 . at a redshift of 6",
    "they find a value of 0.45 compared to our value of 0.2 .",
    "the difference between our relatively steady values and their increasing values is due to two effects .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig - hx ] and @xcite the bright end of the distribution has a steeper slope in the uncorrected for extinction case than the corrected one .",
    "this is due to extinction removing intrinsically bright pixels from the distribution .",
    "second at higher redshifts the average extinction of the sample becomes smaller due to surface brightness dimming removing the highly extincted galaxies from the sample . matching the steep slope of the uncorrected distribution function to the continuously lower extinction sample at higher redshifts results in an over correction and an apparent steadily increasing star formation rate .",
    "figure  [ fig - hx ] shows this effect .",
    "the dimming correction in the right hand column is significantly higher than in the left hand extinction corrected column .",
    "initial work on the star formation history of the universe by @xcite showed a sharp rise in sfr from the present day to a peak at z between 1 and 2 then a decline to lower rates at higher redshifts .",
    "later work by @xcite , which applied a small correction for extinction , showed a shallower decline in sfr at high redshifts .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite , @xcite and tws gave sfrs that were roughly constant at redshifts higher than 1 .",
    "this is consistent with the results presented here .",
    "the sfr values found in this paper are also consistent with the sfrs found in the sub - millimeter observations of @xcite at redshifts of 1 - 3 and 3 - 6 .",
    "the concordance of results between the various studies is discused in   [ s - con ] .",
    "figure  [ fig - sfr ] shows the sfr versus redshift corrected for the surface brightness dimming and the selection function as described in   [ sec - sbd ] .",
    "the redshift binning unit is 1 centered on integer redshifts .",
    "the lowest redshift included in the study is 0.5 and the highest is 6.5 .",
    "the nhdf statistics are not adequate at redshifts below 0.5 to determine an accurate sfr . in that redshift range",
    "the number of sources is low and the percentage error in redshift is high , leading to high sfr errors .",
    "the accuracy of large area ground based surveys is much greater in this redshift range .",
    "although figure  [ fig - hmag ] shows galaxies at redshifts above 6.5 we do not use them in this analysis .",
    "the usual form of the ` madau diagram ' plots sfr versus redshift since redshift is the measured quantity and is not subject to the choice of cosmology .",
    "this form of the diagram can be misleading in terms of when the majority of star formation occurs since there is very little time at high redshifts .",
    "a more instructive plot is the star formation rate versus age of the universe . in the era of ` precision cosmology '",
    "one can dare to produce such a plot with reasonable assumptions on the cosmology",

    "the non integer age units are dictated by the ends of the redshift range .    within the errors",
    "the sfr is roughly constant from an age of the universe between 1 and 7 gigayears at a rate significantly above the present day rate .",
    "the trend of the data indicates an increase in the formation rate from 1 gigayear to 7 gigayears but the errors are too large to validate this impression .",
    "note that the binning of the objects is quite different between the sfr versus redshift and versus age of the universe plots .",
    "the error analysis for this data set was carried out in the same manner as the analysis performed in tws where there is an extensive discussion of the analysis procedures .",
    "table  [ tab - ers ] gives the error sources from number statistics , photometric error and large scale structure .",
    "the greatly increased number of sources in this data set has reduced number statistics to a negligible error compared to other error sources .",
    "photometric errors can propagate into errors in redshift , extinction , and sed .",
    "these in turn create errors in the sfr . as in tws",
    ", the photometric error analysis computes the sfr in each redshift bin for 100 runs of the data with the flux values of each object altered randomly by the gaussian distribution of the flux errors calculated for each object .",
    "the flux error is the total flux error which includes both the random and systematic error shown in the denominator of equation  [ eq : chisq ] . due to the variation of sensitivity across the nicmos detector ,",
    "the errors in nicmos flux are calculated individually for each galaxy .",
    "the distribution of sfrs between the runs determines the sfr error level from photometric errors .",
    "the solid line photometric error bars in figure  [ fig - sfr ] are the 16% and 84% points of the sfr distribution in quadrature with the 17% redshift error discussed in   [ ss - prac ] .",
    "this procedure integrates the photometric error induced redshift , extinction and sed errors into a measured sfr error .",
    "the procedure preserves the redshift , extinction , and sed calculated in each run , therefore , we can plot the individual errors in each parameter as a function of the f160w ab magnitude .",
    "figures [ fig - zer ] , [ fig - eer ] and [ fig - ter ] show the histograms of redshift , extinction and template sed errors in f160w ab magnitude bins ranging from 20 to 29 for all of the sources listed in table  [ tab1 ] . in each case",
    "the unperturbed value is subtracted from the perturbed value . note that since the histograms include the more error prone objects in the 0.0 - 0.5 and 6.6 - 8.0 redshift ranges they are a conservative measure of the error .",
    "the error histograms do not show any significant trend with magnitude .",
    "the basic reason is that the systematic part of the error scales with flux so that the perturbations for the strong fluxes are larger than for the weaker fluxes , accurately reflecting the observations . as mentioned in ",
    "[ s - pres ] , the 10% systematic error is probably an overestimation so errors at brighter magnitudes may be overestimations . if this is the case the error bars in figure  [ fig - sfr ] may be exaggerated .",
    "both the redshift and extinction errors show a trend of being asymmetric around zero error with an over abundance of negative errors showing larger redshifts and extinctions for the unperturbed values than for the perturbed values .",
    "both of these effects indicate larger sfrs for the unperturbed versus the perturbed values .",
    "this trend is reflected in the overall sfr errors shown in figure  [ fig - sfr ] where the error bars extend further on the low side than the high side for most of the redshift bins .      as in tws the two - point correlation function @xmath38 as given by @xcite is used to calculate the large scale structure error .",
    "the fractional error is taken as @xmath39 where    @xmath40    and    @xmath41    for each redshift bin it is a very good approximation to consider the volume as a long thin tube of square cross section with sides of ( comoving ) dimension d and ( comoving ) length l. then the expression for @xmath42 has the form    @xmath43    the quantity @xmath44 is simply the number of cubes of dimension @xmath45 that can be placed end to end in the tube of length l. the dimensionless coefficient @xmath46 is a double integral in which @xmath47 is taken over the unit cube and @xmath48 covers that same cube plus a large number of cubes on either side of this unit cube .",
    "we have evaluated this coefficient numerically which is vastly simplified by the large number of symmetries in this geometry . from the work of @xcite we adopt @xmath49 = 1.8 and @xmath50 mpc and find @xmath51 = 8.22 .",
    "we use the value of d and l for our adopted cosmology appropriate to the center of each bin .",
    "the calculation was made for a square field equal to one wfpc2 chip and then the errors for the three fields were added in quadrature . the larger field and",
    "the increased photometric error means that large scale structure is no longer the dominant but still an important error in extrapolating the sfr history in the nhdf to the sfr history of the universe .",
    "the dashed error bars in figures  [ fig - sfr ] and  [ fig - sfrt ] are the quadrature sum of the photometric and large scale structure errors .",
    "ground based k magnitude functions have provided constraints on galaxy formation models , eg .",
    "the much deeper f160w magnitude function determined here provides an even more powerful constraint on theoretical models .",
    "a great advantage of this function is that is completely independent of models or cosmology .",
    "figure  [ fig - hlum ] shows the observed f160w magnitude function for the nhdf .",
    "the roll off at magnitudes greater than 28 is due to surface brightness dimming and is not a true feature of the magnitude function . in the range of validity ,",
    "the magnitude functions from the wfpc2 f814w band @xcite and the nicmos f160w band are remarkably similar .",
    "@xcite proposed two tests to discriminate between hierarchical galaxy formation and pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) of galaxies .",
    "both models were constrained to fit the present day k band luminosity function .",
    "since the predictions are for the k band , k band magnitudes were calculated from the observed 1.6 micron flux using the seds found by the analysis .",
    "any error in this transformation is very small compared to the differences in the predictions between the hierarchical and ple models .",
    "the first test compares the number density of galaxies versus k magnitude at redshifts of 0.6 , 1.0 , and 2.0 .",
    "the ple model predicts many more bright galaxies at each redshift than do the hierarchical models .",
    "since the predictions only go as faint as a k magnitude of 21.5 the number statistics in the nhdf are small .",
    "the ple model predicts a factor of 10 more bright galaxies than are observed in the nhdf at redshifts of 1 and 2 .",
    "the hierarchical predictions are within the error bars of the observations .",
    "a more decisive test from @xcite is their prediction of the relative fraction of galaxies versus redshift in k magnitude bins .",
    "figure  [ fig - frt ] shows the predictions and the observations .",
    "the first two magnitude bins have 1 and 0 galaxies in the nhdf but the third k 19 - 21 bin has a significant number of galaxies .",
    "it clearly favors the hierarchical model with the data and prediction being virtually indistinguishable .",
    "although the predictions end at a k magnitude of 21 , the data for fainter magnitudes follows an extrapolation of the hierarchical prediction at those magnitudes .",
    "the net results of the two tests are consistent with the hierarchical prediction and inconsistent with the ple prediction .",
    "our analysis determines the redshift , extinction , and intrinsic sed therefore a combination of the flux , redshift , and sed determines the total luminosity of the galaxy to the accuracy of the individual parameters .",
    "the great depth of nhdf observations provides further constraints on galaxy formation models by observing the evolution of the luminosity function with time .",
    "figure  [ fig - lume ] shows the luminosity function at 6 different epochs , z = 1 - 6 .",
    "the roll off of each curve at low luminosities is simply due to galaxies falling below the detection limit . to observational accuracy , the shapes of the luminosity functions at each epoch appear remarkably similar .",
    "the low absolute values for the luminosity function at a redshift of 5 may be due to a void in the nhdf at that redshift .    it should be noted that even though the luminosity function appears invariant with redshift to z = 6 , this does not mean that the mass function is also invariant .",
    "very young galaxies at a redshift of 6 require much less mass to achieve the same luminosity as old , present day galaxies .",
    "in fact , the invariant luminosity function appears to favor the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly .",
    "the observed infrared and sub - mm backgrounds place constraints on the extinction values found in our @xmath5 analysis . if the extincted luminosity is significantly different from the observed infrared background levels then the extinction values may be considered suspect . a calculated background flux that is much higher than the observed background would indicate an over correction for extinction and a higher sfr than allowed by the infrared and sub - mm constraints .",
    "on the other hand , if the extincted luminosity is much lower than the infrared background levels it would be a sign that our analysis has missed a large part of the highly obscured star formation activity .",
    "in addition the calculated sub - mm luminosity of individual sources should not exceed the detections and limits set in the nhdf by @xcite . note that although comparison with the observed background and emission from individual objects is a constraint on the extinction values , agreement is not a validation of the values .",
    "the difference between e(b - v ) values of 1 and 2 is a large extinction error but both predict essentially the same amount of re - emitted flux since they both remove almost all of the uv and optical luminosity .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite have explored the errors in transforming between extinctions derived from the optical flux and the observed infrared emission .",
    "@xcite estimates that the error is a factor of 2 for individual sources which reduces to 20% for a group of about 50 galaxies .",
    "@xcite cite errors of 0.2 - 0.3 dex ( 1.6 - 2.0 ) and ascribe the same range in sfr error .",
    "the error bars in figures  [ fig - sfr ] and  [ fig - sfrt ] are well within these limits , particularly since the points represent hundreds of galaxies rather than individual galaxies .",
    "the fraction of luminosity removed by extinction is easily calculated for each sed from the calzetti obscuration law .",
    "this luminosity is assigned to a dust emission sed .",
    "dust seds vary significantly @xcite but there is no easy way to predict which sed is appropriate from just the optical and near - ir observations . for consistency a single dust",
    "sed is used from figure 1 of @xcite for the pah features joined with the arp 220 ulirg spectrum given in figure 4 of @xcite .",
    "the scuba 850  flux as well as the iso 6 and 15  fluxes listed in table  [ tab1 ] are calculated from the sed , e(b - v ) , redshift and luminosity .",
    "integration of all of the predicted 850  fluxes gives a 850  background of @xmath52 watts m@xmath53 steradian@xmath54 .",
    "the 850  flux is consistent with the value of @xmath55 from @xcite and @xmath56 for cobe @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the probably more accurate cobe flux is remarkable but it should be interpreted only that the predicted sub - mm flux does not indicate an error in the derived parameters    integration of the observed 1.6  fluxes gives a 1.6  discrete source background of @xmath57 watts m@xmath53 steradian@xmath54 .",
    "the previous 1.6  background in the deep nicmos nhdf from tws was @xmath58 .",
    "the f160w background found here is significantly less than the j ( @xmath59 ) and k ( @xmath60 ) backgrounds found by @xcite .",
    "it is also less than but closer to the k band background of @xmath61 found by @xcite .",
    "our background subtraction technique will remove any component of the true background not due to detected discrete sources .",
    "although it is not the primary purpose of the infrared flux calculation , the calculated fluxes of individual sources can be compared with observations and observational limits .",
    "we define an ultra luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) as a galaxy with greater than @xmath62 l@xmath27 total luminosity with half or greater of the luminosity emitted in the mid and far infrared .",

    "source 800 may also contain an agn component .",
    "although not listed in their detection catalog , the chandra x - ray map of @xcite clearly shows a source at the position of source 800 . source 439 ( 166 in tws )",
    ", however , falls to lirg status with a luminosity of @xmath63 l@xmath27 .",
    "the primary reason is that the best fit in this analysis is a template 5.7 and e(b - v ) = 0.5 fit as compared to a template 5.9 and e(b - v ) = 1.0 fit in tws .",
    "although the differences in predicted fluxes is small , the luminosity difference between the two fits is large . given the higher signal to noise , the parameters found in tws are more likely correct .",
    "there are two very high redshift galaxies , 22 and 396 , with ulirg level luminosities but their redshifts of 8.0 and 7.44 put them beyond the galaxies considered in this paper .",
    "the validity of these source will be left to another study .",
    "an additional two candidates included in this analysis are sources 475 and 1364 at redshifts of 6.24 and 4.88 respectively .",
    "these do not correspond to any wfpc2 nhdf source and are both outside of the field of the deep nicmos image .",
    "source 1364 has a small amount of f814w flux while 475 has no detectable flux in any of the optical bands .",
    "both galaxies have significant f110w and f160w fluxes with very red f160w - f110w colors .",
    "the @xmath5 plots show two very broad minima at redshifts between 1 and 2 and at the higher redshifts where the fit is the best .",
    "both of the high redshift minima are extremely broad , covering a redshift range of approximately 2 around the selected redshift . given the nature of the @xmath5 distribution , the ulirg status of these sources is extremely uncertain .    with no reliable detection of additional ulirgs in this study",
    "we can throw no light on the question of whether ulirgs were much more prevalent in the past , reaching a peak near a redshift of two .",
    "if the two possible ulirgs above were at a redshift of 2 rather than their high redshifts , their luminosities would be considerably sub - ulirg .",
    "the existence of any ulirgs in the area of the nhdf is still highly improbable , however , given the local space density of ulirgs .",

    "the sfrs in figure  [ fig - sfr ] for the optical , optical plus near infrared , and submillimeter , however , are all in agreement . on the face of it",
    "this would seem to indicate that there is no large missing component of star formation . on the other hand",
    "the agreement may be fortuitous or the definitions may be misleading .",
    "this section examines the various studies to see what is missing and how the agreement has been achieved .",
    "the only inconsistent measurements in figure  [ fig - sfr ] are the measurements of @xcite which show a fall off of star formation at a redshift of 4 and generally lower sfr at all redshifts .",
    "the sfrs in @xcite are derived from the numbers presented in @xcite , ( note erroneous reference in @xcite ) which do not appear to be corrected for surface brightness dimming .",
    "the lack of dimming correction appears to be the principal reason for the fall off at high redshifts .",
    "the average extinction correction in @xcite is a@xmath69 = 1.2 , which is an underestimate according to this work and accounts for the lower values at redshifts 1 to 2 .",
    "the extinction corrected sfrs at redshifts 3 and 4 from @xcite , corrected for the cosmology adopted here , are coincident with the sfrs found in this work .",
    "the extinction corrected values were found by multiplying the uncorrected sfrs by 4.7 , corresponding to an e(b - v ) = 0.15 @xcite .",
    "the extinction correction value in @xcite is well motivated and is interpreted there as the proper correction to the uv flux from observed galaxies in the study .",
    "it could also be interpreted as a lower e(b - v ) correction to the observed galaxies plus a factor that accounts for galaxies not observed due to very high extinction . without determining an extinction for each galaxy in the sample",
    "it is not possible to separate the two interpretations .",
    "it still leaves the possibility that the actual average extinction to the observed galaxies is less than e(b - v)= 0.15 and that there are other undetected galaxies that contribute to the sfrs observed by @xcite .",
    "note that the comparison with the @xcite in @xcite figure 11 is to the uncorrected rate and a @xmath70 universe .",
    "the sfrs in this work are both extinction corrected on an individual galaxy basis and corrected for surface brightness dimming",
    ". the extinction correction at redshifts 2 and 4 are 4.9 and 6.1 , near the range of the @xcite correction .",
    "the surface brightness dimming corrections are 2.0 in both cases , therefore , the extinction correction is the dominant correction rather than galaxies or parts of galaxies undetected due to surface brightness dimming .",
    "this would appear to indicate that the observed sub - mm sfr can be accounted for by galaxies that are observable in deep hst optical and near infrared observations if not necessarily optical ground based observations .",
    "it can also be argued that the present work has been unsuccessful in identifying the 3 observed sub - mm sources in the fields of the 3 wf chips .",
    "there is no doubt that there can be luminous galaxies that are so highly extincted that even deep hst observations will miss them . at a redshift of 3 the f160w nicmos band is measuring the 4000 @xmath28 flux which can be severely extincted .",
    "it is also possible that the optical depth that can be reached with the f160w filter is less than the total optical depth of the galaxy so that the present analysis determines a lower luminosity and extinction than is actually present in the galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that the assumed dust sed is not appropriate for the bright sub - mm sources .",
    "the luminosity in the 850 @xmath21 scuba band is a small fraction of the total dust luminosity , therefore , small changes in the dust sed can greatly change the 850 @xmath21 luminosity without significantly affecting the total dust luminosity .",
    "perhaps the bright sub - mm sources have colder dust seds than the arp 220 dust sed used here .",
    "the bottom line is that on an individual source level there are many uncertainties that can lead to erroneous sub - mm predictions in the present analysis",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the sub - mm predictions are only intended to serve as a check on the total sub - mm power not as a individual source predictor .    in assessing the effect of underpredicting the bright sub - mm sources it",
    "should be noted that the correction factor used in @xcite to account for the fainter undetected sources is a factor of 11,therefore , the bright sub - mm sources account for less than 10@xmath16 of the sfr .",
    "based on the size of the correction it might be argued that the majority of star formation is also missed by the sub - mm observations .",
    "the correction to the sub - mm observations depends on the assumed luminosity function whereas the correction to the optical and near ir observations depends on the assumed extinction law .",
    "even if all of the observed sub - mm sources are missed by optical and near - ir studies , the error in the sfr is small .",
    "it can be argued that at the depth of the hst observations only the most obscured sources are missed and that the bulk of the galaxies that produce the sub - mm emission and the majority of the sfr are detected and on the average properly accounted for . within the caveats discussed above",
    "it appears that although some of the extreme sub - mm sources are missed by the optical and near infrared observations , the total sfr derived from optical , optical and near infrared , and sub - mm observations are in agreement indicating that the majority of the sfr is accounted for in the three types of observations .",
    "all of these methods however , have correction factors on the order of a factor of 10 based on assumptions that still need to be confirmed .",
    "analysis of hst archival data from wfpc2 and nicmos in the nhdf yields photometric redshifts , extinctions and seds for almost 2000 galaxies . from this data",
    "the extinction corrected sfr for each galaxy was determined .",
    "after correction for surface brightness dimming and the variable sensitivity over the nicmos detector arrays , the star formation history of the nhdf from a redshift 1 to 6 shows a roughly constant sfr .",
    "optical studies of lyman break galaxies and sub - mm observations produce sfrs that are consistent with the results in this study .",
    "the sub - mm background predicted from our analysis is consistent with the observed background , indicating that the analysis has not missed a significant star forming component due to high extinction .",
    "the inability to accurately predict the fluxes and locations of the observed nhdf sub - mm sources does indicate that some bright sub - mm sources are certainly missed by this work but that these are not the sources that contribute the majority of star formation in the field .",
    "the author would like to acknowledge the significant contributions to this work by ray weymann and lisa storrie - lombardi in the initial data reduction and analysis as well as their contributions in establishing the methodology which was carried over from tws .",
    "the author would also like to thank mark dickinson and all of his group who planned and executed the nicmos observations of the entire northern hdf in a general observer program .",
