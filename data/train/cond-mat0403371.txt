    "the interaction of oxygen with silver surfaces has been intensively studied because of the key role of silver in many important industrial oxidation reactions such as , for example , partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde or ethylene epoxidation.@xcite these reactions occur very efficiently when ag powders are employed as a catalyst .",
    "since the particles which compose these powders are affected by many surface defects of different nature and with different concentrations , their chemistry can be extremely different from that of perfect low - miller - index surfaces .",
    "indeed the presence of various inequivalent adsorption sites suggests that atomic and molecular oxygen can adsorb forming species of different chemical nature .",
    "the microscopic characterization of such adsorbed species is a fundamental issue to understand the catalytic activity of ag powders .",
    "a large amount of experimental and theoretical results clearly indicates that steps , kinks , and other surface imperfections play a crucial role in surface chemistry .",
    "for example , the study of many systems such as n and o adsorbed on ru(0001),@xcite o on pt(111),@xcite or c@xmath0h@xmath1 on ag(100)@xcite has shown that monoatomic steps can bind adsorbates more strongly than terrace sites .",
    "moreover it has been shown that this kind of defects can completely determine the kinetics of dissociation in systems such as , for example , n@xmath0 and no on ru(0001),@xcite o@xmath0 on pt(111),@xcite n@xmath0 on fe(110 ) and fe / ru(0001).@xcite    the role of steps in the dynamics of o@xmath0/ag interaction has been recently investigated by rocca and coworkers@xcite who have studied the ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) surfaces .",
    "these surfaces are vicinal of ag(100 ) and are characterized by open ( 110 ) steps and three - atom- and one - atom - row wide ( 100 ) terraces , respectively . using a supersonic molecular beam to dose o@xmath0 onto ag surfaces at selected angles of incidence and different kinetic energies , and characterizing the adsorbed species by vibrational spectroscopy ( hreel ) , these authors have investigated the various oxygen species which form on these surfaces .",
    "it was concluded that o@xmath0 dissociation occurs mainly at the steps and that atomic oxygen adsorbs at different surface sites . in particular , hreel spectra show two peaks in the frequency region of the o / ag stretch modes , at about 32 and 40 mev .",
    "these frequencies are quite similar to those observed in o / ag(100 ) ( 33 mev)@xcite and on the added - row reconstructed o / ag(110 ) surface ( 40 mev).@xcite it was thus proposed to assign the low energy peak to adatoms occupying ( 100 ) terrace sites and the one at higher energy to atomic oxygen adsorbed at the step edges forming o  ag  o chains similar to the added rows found in reconstructed o / ag(110 ) surfaces.@xcite in o / ag(210 ) an additional peak around 56 mev was found , and it was proposed that it is due to the vibration of an oxygen atom occupying a subsurface site",
    ".    motivated by these results we have performed _ ab initio _ calculations aimed at understanding the role of the steps in the adsorption of atomic oxygen on the ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) surfaces . in the present work we limit our investigation to on - surface atomic oxygen , subsurface and molecular adsorption will be addressed in separate papers .",
    "our results show that on these vicinal surfaces the adsorption configuration in which the adatoms decorate the steps in a ( 1@xmath21 ) geometry is particularly stable .",
    "the oxygen adsorption on the two surfaces presents however significant differences related to the availability of adsorption sites on terraces . indeed , on ag(410 ) ,",
    "terrace and step edge sites have comparable chemisorption energies and , in particular , the hollow sites on terraces are slightly more favored than the step edge sites when the adatoms are far apart from each other . at higher coverage , instead , adatoms slightly prefer to decorate the steps . on ag(210 ) , the absence of favorable terrace sites makes the step decoration much more stable than any other adsorption configurations .",
    "the formation of these o  ag  o chains at step edges will be shown to significantly affect both the geometrical structure and the electronic properties of the surface .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the occurrence of adsorption on both the terraces and steps of vicinal ag(100 ) surfaces was also proposed based on an analysis of the hreel spectra , recently measured for these systems.@xcite our calculation of the vibrational properties of these systems  performed within density - functional perturbation theory ",
    "provides a further support to this analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theo ] we describe the theoretical approach and computational details of our work .",
    "section [ sec : res ] contains our results for the energetics , the geometrical and electronic structures , and for the vibrational properties of the systems we have investigated .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "all the calculations have been performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional.@xcite vibrational properties have been calculated using density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt).@xcite we have used the pseudopotential method with ultra - soft pseudopotentials @xcite and plane - wave basis sets up to a kinetic - energy cutoff of 27 ry ( 216 ry for the charge - density cutoff ) .",
    "details about the ag and o pseudopotentials are reported in ref .  .",
    "brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations have been performed with the gaussian - spreading special - point technique@xcite with a smearing parameter of 0.03 ry .",
    "all the calculations have been performed using the pwscf and phonon packages,@xcite while molecular graphics has been generated with the xcrysden package.@xcite    surfaces are modeled with periodic super - cells . for the ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) surfaces we have used slabs of 20 ( 410 ) layers and 14 ( 210 ) layers , respectively . for the ag(100 )",
    "surface and the ( 2@xmath21 ) added - row reconstructed ag(110 ) surface [ ag(110)p(2@xmath21)o ] we have used slabs of 7 layers .",
    "adjacent slabs are separated by a vacuum region of at least 16 a.u . and",
    "o atoms are adsorbed on both sides of the slabs .",
    "all the structures have been fully relaxed until the hellmann - feynman forces were smaller than @xmath3 ry / a.u .",
    "atomic oxygen adsorption on ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) has been modeled by ( 1@xmath21 ) and ( 2@xmath21 ) surface super - cells . for the ag(410 ) surface the bz integrations",
    "have been performed using a ( 8@xmath24@xmath21 ) and a ( 4@xmath24@xmath21 ) uniform shifted @xmath4-mesh@xcite for the ( 1@xmath21 ) and ( 2@xmath21 ) structures , respectively , while for ag(210 ) ( @xmath5 ) and ( @xmath6 ) meshes have been used for ( 1@xmath21 ) and ( 2@xmath21 ) structures , respectively . for the c(2@xmath22 )",
    "cell on ag(100 ) we have used a ( @xmath7 ) mesh , while for the ag(110)p(2@xmath21)o surface we have used a ( @xmath8 ) mesh .",
    "spin polarization effects have been neglected after checking that the interaction between o and ag substrate results in a negligible spin moment on the o atom .",
    "the chemisorption energies , @xmath9 , are referred to the clean ag(@xmath1010 ) , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , surface and the isolated oxygen molecule : @xmath13 where the total energy of the adsorbate ",
    "substrate system , of the clean surface , of the isolated o@xmath0 molecule , and the number of adsorbed oxygen atoms are represented by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . with this definition ,",
    "stable adsorbates have negative chemisorption energies . considering the errors in the structural relaxation and the energy convergence with respect to the plane wave cutoff energy and the k - point density",
    ", we estimate an overall numerical accuracy for the chemisorption energies of about 30 mev .",
    "the pbe gga functional used in the present work slightly overestimates the binding energy of the o@xmath0 molecule : 5.50 ev , as calculated using spin - polarized gga with a 15  - wide cubic box , while the experimental value is 5.23 ev.@xcite molecular overbinding is a common drawback of current implementations of dft .",
    "this fact , of course , does not affect the conclusions of the present work which mainly concerns the _ relative _ stability of different adsorption configurations .",
    "vibrational frequencies are calculated by diagonalizing the @xmath18 dynamical matrices of large slabs containing more that 50 atomic layers .",
    "the common procedure for calculating the dynamical matrices of such large slabs is to patch the dynamical matrices obtained for much smaller slabs ( in fact , the same which were used to determine the structural properties , as described above ) with the interatomic force constants calculated for the bulk metal.@xcite the dynamical matrices of the ag bulk have been calculated on a 4@xmath24@xmath24 grid of * q*-points in the bz and the interatomic force constants have been obtained by a fourier transform.@xcite for the thin slabs , we have computed only the parts of the dynamical matrices which refer to the displacements of the adsorbates and of the uppermost ag layers . diagonalizing the dynamical matrix of the extended slab we have calculated the vibrational modes of the systems and we have identified the adsorbate - substrate modes from the displacements eigenvectors .",
    "the estimated numerical accuracy of the vibrational frequencies so obtained is of about 1 mev .",
    "in fig . [ fig : surf ] we display the four adsorption sites that we have considered in the present work : site a with o just above the step and coordinated with three ag surface atoms ; sites t@xmath19 and t@xmath0 with the adatom in the hollow sites on the ( 100 ) terrace ; site b where o adatom lies in the hollow site just below the step .",
    "note that no terrace t@xmath19 and t@xmath0 sites are available on the ag(210 ) .",
    "top and bridge sites are not considered here since we have found that they are much less stable than hollow sites , as on ag(100 ) surface.@xcite      let us first consider the adsorption of atomic oxygen on the ag(410 ) surface . in table [ tab:1 ]",
    "we present the chemisorption energies corresponding to different adsorption configurations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : configs ] ) . at low coverage ( @xmath20 1/8 ml)@xcite where the adatoms stay far apart from each other , the hollow sites on terraces ( t@xmath19 and t@xmath0 ) and the step - edge site ( a ) are almost degenerate in energy , with terrace sites being only slightly more favored than site a , while site b is much less stable . in these configurations",
    "the distances between the o atoms are quite large ( 8.32  ) and this suggests a negligible interaction between the adatoms , as confirmed by test calculations done at lower coverages in which the o@xmath21o distance is increased . at higher coverage ( @xmath20 1/4 ml )",
    "we have examined various possible geometries which we indicate with the notation ` s@xmath19s@xmath0 ' , where the s s stand for two near a , b , t@xmath19 and t@xmath0 sites being occupied by two o adatoms in a ( 2@xmath21 ) super - cell .",
    "the s@xmath19s@xmath19 arrangements correspond to a ( 1@xmath21 ) periodicity where o adatoms form rows parallel to the steps .",
    "those configurations in which the separation between the adatoms is larger than 5  are not considered since we expect that their adsorption energies should be very similar to those at low coverage .",
    "indeed , as we will show , already for o  o distances as small as 4  the interaction between the adsorbates has small effects on the chemisorption energies .",
    "our results show that the s@xmath19s@xmath19 configurations with both the adatoms on the terrace or above the step and the a ",
    "t@xmath0 arrangement are the most stable adsorption geometries . as in the case of low coverage",
    "the differences in chemisorption energy between these sites are quite small , but in this case we find that oxygen adatoms slightly prefer to decorate the step edges .",
    "one expects that occupying adjacent sites should be unfavorable because of the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged oxygen adatoms .",
    "indeed , for example , feibelman and co - workers@xcite have shown that o adatoms on pt(211 ) vicinal surface decorate the steps in a ( 2@xmath21 ) adsorption geometry while the ( 1@xmath21 ) structure  where the distance between adjacent oxygens is about 2.8   is significantly less stable .",
    "our results indicate that this effect on ag(410 ) surface is important only when nearest neighbor sites are occupied , i.e. when the distance between the adatoms is less than 4  ( as in a ",
    "t@xmath19 , t@xmath19t@xmath0 , t@xmath0b and a  b , configurations ) , while it is weak and uneffective in the other geometries .",
    "compare for example the a  t@xmath0 and a  t@xmath19 configurations which consist of one adatom sitting above the step while the other sits at a terrace site . in the a ",
    "t@xmath0 arrangement the distance between the o atoms is 4.23  and their chemisorption energy ( @xmath210.80 ev ) is quite close to the values found for oxygen adsorption at sites a and t@xmath0 at low coverage ( @xmath210.75 ev and @xmath210.83 ev ) , indicating a small adsorbate - adsorbate interaction . in the a ",
    "t@xmath19 configuration , instead , the o ",
    "o distance is only 3.26  and the adsorption energy of the adatoms ( @xmath210.59 ev ) is strongly reduced with respect to when oxygen is adsorbed at sites a and t@xmath19 at low coverage ( @xmath210.75 ev and @xmath210.80 ev ) .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to observe that in the a ",
    "t@xmath19 geometry the electrostatic repulsion strongly affects also the locations of the adatoms .",
    "indeed we find that the adsorbates are slightly displaced from the hollow positions and that their distance , 3.26  , is considerably larger than the separation between two nearest hollow sites of the clean surface ( about 2.9  ) .",
    "this is a clear indication that the two adatoms repel each other .",
    "similar calculations have been performed also for the ag(210 ) surface .",
    "the two surfaces differ in the width of the terrace ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : surf ] ) .",
    "no terrace hollow sites are available on the ag(210 ) surface . in table",
    "[ tab:1b ] we report the chemisorption energies for o adsorbed in various configurations on this surface .",
    "these results display the same trend as obtained for ag(410 ) , although the chemisorption energies are somewhat smaller here . due to the lack of stable adsorption sites on the terraces , the formation of o  ag  o rows at the step edges ( i.e. the a  a configuration )",
    "is by far energetically favored on this surface .",
    "the second most stable configuration at higher coverage ( @xmath22 ml ) is therefore a  b , which is 0.24 ev less bound than a  a .",
    "in contrast , on ag(410 ) several other configurations that involve terrace sites are more stable than a  b and much closer in energy to the a  a configuration . comparing the chemisorption energies of various configurations , irrespective of the o coverage ,",
    "we find that the difference between the most favored a  a configuration and the second most stable one is 0.03 and 0.12  ev for ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) surfaces , respectively .",
    "one of the most peculiar results of our calculations is the increase of the stability of oxygen adatoms when they decorate the step edge in a ( 1@xmath21 ) geometry .",
    "we believe that the mechanism responsible for this behavior could be related to the arrangement of o adatoms to form o  ag  o chains at the upper side of the ( 110 ) steps .",
    "indeed , the a ",
    "a adsorption configuration is similar to that occurring in the reconstruction of the ag(110 ) surface upon oxygen adsorption , in which o atoms align in added - rows along the [ 001 ] direction , thus forming stable o ",
    "o structures@xcite ( the ag(110)p(2@xmath21)o surface is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : added ] ) .",
    "as we have pointed out in the introduction , this similarity between the two structures was first suggested from a comparison of the vibrational properties of the two surfaces.@xcite    before analyzing in detail the structural and electronic features related to the formation of these chains , it is interesting to consider the effects of the substrate relaxation on the chemisorption energies .",
    "for this reason we have repeated some calculations for o / ag(410 ) keeping the substrate fixed in the optimized clean surface geometry and allowing the adatoms to relax ( see values in parentheses in table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "our results show that at low coverage the t@xmath0 site is more stable than a site even if substrate relaxation is not considered . on the other hand , in the ( 1@xmath21 ) periodicity o adatoms in a  a and t@xmath0t@xmath0 configurations have the same chemisorption energy on a fixed substrate .",
    "this result indicates that the enhanced stability of atomic oxygen on the step in the ( 1@xmath21 ) geometry is mainly determined by the energy gain due to surface relaxation allowed by the presence of the steps .      in order to illustrate the characteristic features of the o  ag  o chain formation at the step edges ,",
    "we discuss now the effects of oxygen adsorption on the geometry of the surface . to facilitate the discussion ,",
    "we first define a few labels for silver atoms ",
    "ag@xmath23 , ag@xmath24 , and ag@xmath25as in fig .",
    "[ fig : legend].@xcite      in table [ tab:2 ] we report the optimized structural parameters describing the oxygen adsorption on ag(410 ) at @xmath20 1/8 ml and at @xmath20 1/4 ml for the s@xmath19s@xmath19 configurations .",
    "first of all it is interesting to observe the dependence of the bond lengths between the adsorbate and the nearest metal atoms on the number of neighboring substrate atoms . as predicted by effective medium theory , @xcite the larger the number of nearest metal atoms the longer the bond length . indeed",
    "the results in table [ tab:2 ] ( observe in particular @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) show that the three - fold coordinated step - edge is the site in which o is closest to the surrounding silver atoms ; o in the two four - fold coordinated terrace sites has similar structural features , while o  when sitting in the site just below the step , close to four atoms of the terrace and to two atoms of the step  is the furthest from neighboring metal atoms .",
    "we now focus on the structural features of oxygen adsorption at sites a and t@xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : str1 ] we compare the structure of the first three layers of the substrate for the a and a  a geometries . at low coverage",
    "the main substrate distortions due to the presence of the adatom are a shift of 0.18  of the nearest ag terrace atom towards the center of the terrace ( see @xmath28 in table [ tab:3 ] ) and an expansion of 0.16  of the distance between the two ag atoms on the step near oxygen ( see @xmath29 in table [ tab:3 ] ) .",
    "the result is that the adatom sits in a site equidistant ( @xmath30 = 2.21  ) from the three ag surface atom surrounding it . in",
    "the a  a configuration the distortion has different features . in this case symmetry",
    "does not allow the two ag step atoms near oxygen to be displaced parallel to the step , so that these atoms move only outward .",
    "this is indicated by a marked expansion of the bond lengths between the ag step atom and the ag atoms on terrace ( by 0.25  ) and below the adatom ( by 0.16  ) . in this case",
    "the oxygen is closer to the ag step atoms ( @xmath31 = 2.10  ) than to the nearest ag atom on terrace ( @xmath32 = 2.24  ) .",
    "note also that the angle , @xmath33 , between the bonds of oxygen with the two ag atoms of the step  which directly measures the alignment of the ag  o ",
    "ag structures  is larger at high than at low coverage ( 164@xmath34 versus 156@xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , in the a  a geometry oxygen and silver atoms on the step tend to align forming an almost straight o  ag  o chain which is more stable than other adsorption configurations . as we have already pointed out ,",
    "the o  ag  o chains at the step edges have a similar structure as the added rows in the reconstructed o / ag(110 ) surface , so it is interesting to compare the geometries of the two systems . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] we report some predicted structural quantities for the ag(110)p(2@xmath21)o surface .",
    "our results are in good agreement with experiments@xcite and previous dft calculations.@xcite as we can observe , the alignment of o and ag atoms in the added rows on ag(110 ) is more pronounced than in the a  a configuration ( compare , for example , the angle @xmath33 in the two geometries ) , but the similarity between the two structures is clear .",
    "[ fig : str2 ] shows the structures of t@xmath0 and t@xmath0t@xmath0 configurations . in these systems",
    "the height of the adatom with respect to the terrace is larger than when the oxygen is chemisorbed on the step .",
    "also in this case in the ( 1@xmath21 ) geometry the silver atoms in the row of oxygens move up towards adatoms , but here the alignment between o and ag atoms is less pronounced than when oxygen atoms are on the step .      in table",
    "[ tab:2b ] we report the optimized structural parameters describing the oxygen adsorption on ag(210 ) at @xmath20 1/4 ml and at @xmath20 1/2 ml for the s@xmath19s@xmath19 configurations , while fig .",
    "[ fig : a - oag210 ] shows the side views of the corresponding optimized o / ag(210 ) structures .",
    "these data and plots reveal the same trend as for ag(410 ) surface .",
    "the most apparent feature is that the height of the o adatoms above the surface is much smaller for a and a  a sites than for the b and b  b sites .",
    "note also the difference between the pattern of the substrate reconstruction for a ( low coverage ) and a  a ( high coverage ) configurations .",
    "like on the ag(410 ) surface , the adsorption of o adatoms induces an outward relaxation of step ag atoms for both the a and a  a configurations . in the case of the a configuration",
    "this relaxation is not large enough to compensate the inward relaxation of the clean substrate ( see the inset of top - left panel of fig . [",
    "fig : a - oag210 ] ) , therefore ag atoms at the step appear to be pushed somewhat inward , like in the case of the clean ag(210 ) substrate .",
    "on the contrary , this relaxation is quite significant in the a  a configuration , resulting in a marked expansion of the bond length between the ag step and terrace atoms ( @xmath35   ) , and between the ag step atom and ag atom located below the o adatom ( @xmath36   ) .",
    "note that the step ag atoms appear to be pushed outwards .",
    "contrary to the a  a geometry , in the a configuration the step ag atoms also relax laterally along the step - edge direction away from o adatom  the distance between the two step ag atoms that are bound to the same o adatom being increased by 0.17  .      in order to better characterize the different behavior of oxygen on the step in a and a  a configurations we have analyzed the corresponding electronic structure . here",
    "we present the analysis of the electronic structure of o / ag(410 ) only  the conclusions for o / ag(210 ) being similar .",
    "the interaction between oxygen and silver removes electronic charge from the silver atoms neighboring the o adatom .",
    "the electron deficit regions around the silver atoms are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge ] ( blue isosurfaces ) .",
    "it is interesting to observe that while at low coverage the deficit regions around the three ag atoms are very similar , thus indicating a similar donation of charge , in the a  a configuration the flow of charge to oxygen adatoms is mainly due to silver atoms on the step .",
    "this suggests that the o  ag  o chains that form in the ( 1@xmath21 ) geometry have the structure of electrostatically stable @xmath37 strings .",
    "the analysis of the density of states reveals that the bond between oxygen and silver is not purely ionic . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we display the density of states projected ( pdos ) onto the oxygen adatom and onto the nearest silver atoms for both the a and a  a geometries .",
    "the pdos on o atoms shows that the interaction of the o 2@xmath38 state with the 4@xmath39 metal band results in the formation of two regions of high density of states , which correspond to bonding and antibonding states .",
    "the bonding states are located at the bottom of the 4@xmath39 ag band while the antibonding ones are mainly below the fermi level .",
    "note that the o 2@xmath40 level lies below the bottom of the valence band ( at about @xmath2117 ev with respect to the fermi level ) and it is not shown in the figures .",
    "the main difference between the pdos in the two geometries is that at high coverage additional features appear 67 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the figure clearly shows that these states are due the hybridization of oxygen 2@xmath38 orbitals and 4@xmath39 orbitals of the silver atoms on the step ( ag@xmath41 ) . by inspection of the components of these orbitals we find that the mixing is mainly between o 2@xmath42 orbital parallel to the step - edge and ag 4@xmath43 orbital parallel to the terrace plane",
    "this hybridization is very efficient because of the good alignment between o and ag atoms on the step .",
    "the spatial distribution of these states is illustrated in fig .",

    "it is worth noting that in the other s@xmath19s@xmath19 configurations there are no states in this energy region even if we find an increase of the density of states around @xmath44 ev , especially in the t@xmath0t@xmath0 geometry .",
    "the study of the electronic structure of the added - row reconstructed ag(110 ) surface confirms that the presence of bonding states 67 ev below the fermi level is related to the formation of aligned o  ag  o",

    "in particular the mode @xmath46 could be responsible of the spectral feature around 40 mev observed in the hreel spectra of these surfaces .    for the ag(210 ) surface",
    "we have also investigated the a configuration to understand the effect of the ag  o ",
    "ag chain formation at the step on the vibrational properties . in this case both the frequency and the displacement eigenvectors of the softer modes , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , change very little with respect to the a  a arrangement .",
    "the @xmath47 mode is polarized parallel to the step and is significantly softer than in the a  a structure ( 46 versus 71 mev ) mainly because in this case the height of the adatom with respect to the step ag atoms is larger than in the a  a geometry .    since the hollow terrace sites on ag(410 )",
    "compete in energy with the step edge sites , we have also investigated the vibrational properties of a very stable adsorption configuration which involves terrace sites , namely the t@xmath19t@xmath19 geometry . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modi ] we show the @xmath45 and @xmath46 modes in the plane perpendicular to the step .",
    "the @xmath45 mode at 29 mev is due to the vibration of o nearly perpendicular to the ( 100 ) terrace plane while the @xmath46 mode at 32 mev is due to o vibrating almost parallel to this plane .",
    "the harder mode , @xmath47 , is at 58 mev and it corresponds to the oxygen vibration parallel to the step edge .",
    "our calculations show clearly that the @xmath45 mode is very similar to the dipole active @xmath45 mode of the c(2@xmath22 ) o adsorption geometry on ag(100 ) .",
    "it seems thus reasonable to expect that the spectral feature around 32 mev observed in hreel spectra on ag(410 ) could be due to this stretching mode .",
    "finally we have calculated the vibrational modes for the b  b adsorption geometry on ag(210 ) .",
    "an adatom at site b is significantly less stable than at the step edge , but it is interesting to investigate its vibrational properties since this is the only terrace site available on ag(210 ) and the hreel spectra of this surface show , in addition to the 40 mev peak , other spectral features around 30 mev and 56 mev . as it is shown in table [",
    "tab : osc ] , the higher frequency mode , @xmath47 at 37 mev , is parallel to the step edge , while the other two modes are in the plane perpendicular to it . in particular",
    "the @xmath45 mode at 27 mev is nearly perpendicular the ( 110 ) step plane , while the other , @xmath46 at 34 mev , is almost parallel to it .",
    "two important results emerge from this analysis .",
    "the @xmath45 mode in the t@xmath19-t@xmath19 configuration of o / ag(410 ) at 29 mev lies very close to the @xmath45 mode of o / ag(100 ) ( 30 mev ) , in correspondence with the spectral feature around 32 mev observed in hreel spectra on ag(410).@xcite the @xmath46 modes of the a - a configuration in o / ag(210 ) and o / ag(410 ) ( both at 37 mev ) lie close to the @xmath46 frequency in the added - row o / ag(110 ) surface [ ag(110)p(2@xmath21)o ] at 38 mev , in correspondence with the spectral feature around 40 mev observed in the hreel spectra of o / ag(410 ) and o / ag(210 ) surfaces.@xcite we believe that this correspondence between infrared - active vibrational modes , calculated for specific configurations , and the features found in the experimental hreel spectra supports the proposed assignment of those spectral features to atomic species adsorbed on terraces and at step edges .",
    "problems still remain in the interpretation of the hreel spectra of o / ag(210 ) . on one hand ,",
    "the feature experimentally found at 32 mev could be due to the vibration of oxygen occupying the only available terrace sites ( site b ) , but this assignment remains uncertain since the adsorption on these sites is energetically unfavored . on the other hand ,",
    "no vibration is predicted near 56 mev , where a feature in the experimental spectrum is also found .",
    "this feature could be the signature of other o species , possibly adsorbed subsurface , which we have not investigated in the present work .",
    "for sure , these issues call for further theoretical and , possibly , experimental work .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the adsorption of oxygen on ag(410 ) and ag(210 ) surfaces .",
    "our results show that the step edge decoration is particularly stable on both surfaces .",
    "while on ag(410 ) adsorption on terrace and at the step edge compete in energy and no clear preference is predictable , on ag(210 ) the step decoration is significantly favored with respect to other adsorption configurations .",
    "the formation of this stable o  ag ",
    "o rows at the step edges strongly affects both the structural and the electronic properties of the surface , and leaves a clear fingerprint in the hreel spectrum of these systems at 40 mev .",
    "the situation is less clear for the hreel peak at 32 mev . on ag(410 )",
    "it is reasonable to assign this spectral feature to adatoms occupying terrace sites . on ag(210 ) instead this o  ag stretch mode could be due to o atoms adsorbed on terraces at the step foot , which however are predicted to be metastable adsorption sites . among the adsorption configurations that we have investigated ,",
    "no candidate was found to support the vibrational mode experimentally found at 56 mev .",
    "this suggests that other o species , possibly adsorbed subsurface , would be responsible for this spectral feature .",
