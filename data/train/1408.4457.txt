    "three decades ago , it was established that the quantized hall conductance of the integer quantum hall effect ( qhe )  @xcite is a topological invariant  @xcite classifying the ground state of the system .",
    "the recent discovery of topological insulators in both two - dimensional ( 2d )  @xcite and three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems  @xcite has enormously boosted the interest in topologically non - trivial states of matter .",
    "apart from these presently much studied 2d and 3d states of matter , there is another quantum phenomenon of topological origin : the one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum charge pump . in systems typically described by a 1d harper model",
    "@xcite , charge transfer is induced by a periodic potential which evolves adiabatically in time .",
    "thouless  @xcite has shown that the amount of charge pumped in one cycle can be expressed in terms of the chern invariant precisely as in the 2d qhe . the strict analogy among these two phenomena",
    "is also reflected in the profound relations among the 2d qhe hamiltonian and the 1d harper model and its off - diagonal variant  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of a 1d harper system has been implemented , e.g. , in photonic waveguide arrays  @xcite and in optical lattices  @xcite . in the former , the periodic modulation of the on - site potential was produced by controlling inter - waveguide distances . by adiabatically varying the relative phase between the modulation and the underlying lattice , light was pumped across the sample , revealing the topological nature of the pumping . in optical lattice experiments instead",
    ", the harper hamiltonian has been modeled using the interaction between cold atoms and lasers . as reported in refs .",
    ", rubidium atoms were loaded in an optical lattice and external lasers were used to coax the atoms into circular motion , analogous to the motion of electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "these advances on the experimental side renewed the interest  @xcite in the theory of the quantum charge pump .",
    "in this work we uncover an important and observable property of quantum charge pumps with additional symmetries in the parameter space : at well - defined fractions of the pumping period the system transfers a charge which is quantized in fractions of the chern invariant of the bulk system .",
    "this phenomenon originates from the symmetries of the gauge - invariant berry curvature in momentum space and is not related to the emergence of fractional charges in the system . on top of this , an explicit calculation for systems with open boundary conditions shows that the fractional quantization of the charge pumped _ does not _",
    "rely on the presence of translational symmetry , which can be interpreted as the prime physical consequence of the topological nature of this phenomenon .     which are equivalent up to a gauge transformation .",

    "in a bloch system the chern number of an occupied band is proportional to the integral of the berry curvature over the whole brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "the chern number is topologically invariant and is quantized as an integer number provided there is a full gap separating the occupied bands from the unoccupied ones .",
    "let us then consider the case where additional point or space group symmetries induce a partitioning of the brillouin zone into subregions which are transformed one into the other under a certain group of symmetry transformations .",
    "more precisely , one can imagine a number @xmath1 of simply - connected , non - overlapping , and equally - sized subsets @xmath2 which cover the whole brillouin zone , as shown in [ fig : partitiontorus ] , and such that the bloch states @xmath3 are equivalent up to a gauge transformation @xmath4 , that is @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since the berry curvature is a gauge - invariant measurable quantity  it is defined as @xmath8\\cdot \\hat{\\bm z}$ ] , where @xmath9 is the berry connection  the total chern number can be evaluated as a sum of integrals of the berry curvature over each of the subsets @xmath2 , which all give an equal contribution , and therefore @xmath10 in 2d solids the integral of the berry curvature over the individual subsets @xmath2 is not associated with any meaningful physical quantity .",
    "this , however , is not generally the case for time - dependent systems .",
    "let us consider , for instance , a 1d band insulator under the action of an adiabatic time - varying perturbation , periodic in time and depending on a parameter @xmath11 with period @xmath12 .",
    "if the chemical potential is inside a gap for any possible value of @xmath11 , the total charge transferred , i.e. , the number of particles transported across any section of the chain at the time @xmath13 , can be expressed as an integral over the brillouin zone  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total number of filled bands of the system and @xmath16 the @xmath17th band eigenstate , being @xmath18 the creation operators acting on the ground state @xmath19 .",
    "the integral in [ chernphi ] can be related to the zak phase  @xcite of the system while the charge transferred can be written in terms of the variation of the charge polarization of the 1d system  @xcite along the path @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "[ app : polarization ] ) .     varying in the interval",
    "@xmath21 $ ] , for rational values @xmath22 and for different values of the substrate on - site energy modulation @xmath23 . ]",
    "since the underlying time - dependent hamiltonian of the system is periodic both in the parameter @xmath24 and in the 1d momentum @xmath25 , it follows that , for an evolution over a full period @xmath12 , the parameter space corresponds to a torus and @xmath26 is nothing but the berry phase over this closed manifold .",
    "however , the integral over the full torus can be seen as being composed of @xmath1 non - overlapping subsets , as shown in [ fig : partitiontorus ] , in which the momentum @xmath25 traces a circle while the parameter @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "if the symmetries of the hamiltonian in the parameter space mandate that all these integrals give an equal contribution , then it follows that the charge transferred in the @xmath28 fraction of the pumping period is @xmath29 .",
    "hence the partitioning of the torus in the parameter space combined with the symmetry of the berry curvature leads to a well - defined physical response : a fractionally quantized pumped charge .",
    "this fractional quantization is robust against any perturbation preserving the symmetries of the parameter space .",
    "next we show how such a situation can be achieved in a time - varying 1d superlattice generated by an external potential periodic in real space .",
    "specifically , we consider a system of spinless particles at zero temperature confined in a 1d lattice , like the one in [ fig : system ] , subject to a weak external potential with period @xmath30 times the lattice parameter .",
    "the system is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath31 where @xmath23 is the characteristic perturbation strength while @xmath24 is a phase which we assume to be linear in time .",
    "we note here that this hamiltonian describes either spinless fermions  @xcite or hardcore bosons in 1d optical superlattices . in momentum space",
    ", the tight - binding hamiltonian  ( [ tbspace ] ) becomes @xmath32 which is not diagonal with respect to bloch states , since the substrate potential couples states with momenta @xmath33 .",
    "the non - trivial topological properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ tbmomentum ] ) can be revealed by considering the external perturbation to be commensurate with the lattice , i.e. , @xmath22 with @xmath34 coprimes , leading to a superlattice with @xmath1 atoms in the unit cell and a corresponding mini - brillouin zone @xmath35 $ ] .",

    "similarly , the energy spectra obtained for @xmath38 [ [ fig : spectrum05,fig : spectrum025 ] ] correspond to the hofstadter spectra in the case of rectangular lattices .",
    "this result is an immediate consequence of the mapping  @xcite between the lattice version of the integer qhe problem and the 1d hamiltonian  ( [ tbmomentum ] ) .",
    "since any of the @xmath39 gaps of the hofstadter butterfly corresponds to a gapped state of the 1d system in the full torus spanned by @xmath25 and @xmath24 , one can identify the charge transferred of the 1d system with the chern number @xmath40 labeling the @xmath15th gap of the hofstadter butterfly  @xcite and given by the unique integer solution @xmath41 of the diophantine equation  @xcite @xmath42 .    having established the quantized particle transport in the time - varying 1d systems , we now proceed to reveal the symmetry of the hamiltonian  ( [ tbspace ] ) which leads to a fractional quantization of the pumped charge . to do so",
    ", we introduce the translation operator @xmath43 which translates the whole system by an integer number of lattice sites .",
    "it is possible to verify , by a direct substitution in the hamiltonian  ( [ tbspace ] ) , that the translation of @xmath44 lattice sites is equivalent to a change in the modulation phase of @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 . let us now consider a variation of the modulation phase @xmath47 with @xmath48 integer . from the diophantine equation @xmath49 giving the chern number @xmath50 of the @xmath44th gap , one obtains @xmath51 and therefore a change in the modulation phase @xmath47 is equivalent to a translation of @xmath52 lattice sites @xmath53 hence , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are periodic up to an arbitrary phase , i.e. , @xmath54 for any energy level .",
    "the unitary transformation in [ eq : unitary ] corresponds to a magnetic translation of the guiding center of the landau levels  @xcite in the original 2d hofstadter model .",
    "therefore any variation in the phase modulation of a number @xmath44 of periods @xmath55 is equivalent to a translation of exactly @xmath52 lattice sites of all the eigenstates of the system , independent of the band index @xmath17 .",
    "this is immediately manifested in [ fig : density ] where the charge densities @xmath56 arising from different configurations of the system @xmath57 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : system ] ] are all equivalent up to lattice translations . consequently , the gauge - invariant berry curvature is periodic in the parameter space with period @xmath55 and thus any adiabatic evolution @xmath58 contributes equally to the integral in [ chernphi ] , for any initial modulation phase @xmath24 .",
    "the total transferred charge over the cycle @xmath59 is thus given by @xmath60 .",
    "put differently , the charge transferred in any of the adiabatically gapped phases , described by an adiabatic evolution with @xmath47 , is quantized in multiples of a fraction @xmath61 of the chern number , i.e. , @xmath62 this result is confirmed by a direct calculation of [ chernphi ] , where the eigenstates have been obtained via exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian  ( [ tbmomentum ] ) .",
    "shows the calculated charge transferred as a function of the modulation phase variation @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "while the charge transferred in any of the the adiabatically gapped phase @xmath15 along the path @xmath65 is quantized as @xmath66 , the charge transferred along @xmath67 is quantized as a fraction of the chern number according to [ fractionalcharge ] , _ independent _ of the initial phase .",
    "as we show in the [ app : robust ] , this result is robust against perturbations preserving the symmetries of the parameter space .",

    "in an infinite periodic system , the fractional quantization of the pumped charge originates simply from the fact that for any phase shift @xmath77 , the external potential configuration is shifted by an integer number @xmath52 of lattice sites and so does the local density  @xcite @xmath78 [ cf .",
    "[ fig : density ] ] in the kinetic ( @xmath75 ) as well as in the atomic regime ( @xmath76 )  @xcite .",
    "this , however , makes no assertion on whether or how signatures of the fractional quantization of the pumped charge can be directly detected in systems with open boundary conditions , where the translational symmetry is explicitly broken . to answer this question , we thus consider the temporal variation of the center of charge @xmath79 in a finite system of length @xmath80 , which has been proposed to encode the topological pumped charge in atomic clouds  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the adiabatic evolution @xmath81 taking place in a finite time interval . if one multiplies @xmath73 to both terms of the continuity equation @xmath82 with @xmath83 the current density  @xcite , integrates over space and time , and assumes that the phase parameter is linear in time , one obtains @xmath84 in the equation above , the second and third integral correspond to the pumped charge respectively within the bulk and at the edges of the system . as a consequence , along any adiabatic evolution @xmath81 , the variation of the center of charge @xmath85",

    "this result is confirmed by direct numerical calculations also in the case @xmath95 ( see [ app : thermo ] ) .",

    "<S> a one - dimensional quantum charge pump transfers a quantized charge in each pumping cycle . </S>",
    "<S> this quantization is topologically robust being analogous to the quantum hall effect . </S>",
    "<S> the charge transferred in a fraction of the pumping period is instead generally unquantized . </S>",
    "<S> we show , however , that with specific symmetries in parameter space the charge transferred at well - defined fractions of the pumping period is quantized as integer fractions of the chern number . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate this in a one - dimensional harper - hofstadter model and show that the fractional quantization of the topological charge pumping is _ independent _ of the specific boundary conditions taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we further discuss the relevance of this phenomenon for cold atomic gases in optical superlattices . </S>"
