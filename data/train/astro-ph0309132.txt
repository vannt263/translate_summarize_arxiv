    "any stationary axisymmetric non - relativistic , rotating , magnetized wind will collimate at large distances from the source , under perfect mhd conditions and polytropic thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these results hold also for relativistic winds .",
    "we have recently extended our general analysis @xcite by presenting global analytic asymptotic solutions for non - relativistic winds , valid from the pole to the equator , assuming given first integrals .",
    "this paper extends our general analysis to relativistic winds .",
    "flows which bring no poynting flux to infinity are called _",
    "kinetic winds_. their magnetic surfaces asymptote to paraboloids ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if poynting flux reaches infinity , the flow is called a _ poynting jet_. the magnetic surfaces then asymptotically approach cylinders or conical surfaces in which cylindrical ones are nested .",
    "we refer to a magnetic surface as being _ asymptotically conical _ if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 approach infinity on this magnetic surface , such that @xmath2 approaches a finite value .",
    "we find that the asymptotic structure of relativistic winds consists of _ field - regions _ where the lorentz force vanishes in the direction normal to magnetic surfaces .",
    "these regions are bounded by null surfaces where the magnetic field vanishes . in the vicinity of null surfaces ,",
    "the plasma pressure , or possibly the poloidal magnetic pressure , is significant .",
    "the vicinity of the polar axis is also a boundary layer region .",
    "relativistic winds are likely to be present near pulsars , active galactic nuclei , microquasars and gamma ray burst sources . their structure has been first discussed assuming conical magnetic surfaces ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the cross field force balance has been considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has then been recognized that both non - relativistic and relativistic winds focus asymptotically ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and that mhd forces may contribute to the wind acceleration .",
    "it is possible however that a confinement mechanism other than the action of the hoop stress should be operating ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the general - relativistic dynamics of mhd winds for given field geometries has been discussed by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "much work has also been devoted to the determination of the shape of the magnetic surfaces and to the wind dynamics .",
    "these studies considered the special - relativistic ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) as well as the general - relativistic transfield equation that describes force balance accross field lines ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "analytical models , usually involving some form of self - similarity , have been presented ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite extended the self - similar analysis of @xcite to relativistic winds .",
    "their approach , as is the case here , does not rely on the force - free approximation .",
    "their self - similarity requirement restricts the rotation profile of the wind source to be proportional to @xmath3 , imposes the wind source to be of an infinite extent and the return current flow to be an axial singularity .",
    "this limits the type of asymptotics for this model to circum - polar current carrying structures . the parabolic shape obtained by @xcite is made possible by the fact that their wind source subtends infinite flux ( @xcite , appendix c ) . by contrast",
    ", their approach deals with the criticality and alfvn regularity conditions exactly , whereas in our approach it is only assumed that the set of first integrals is consistent with these conditions . because the return current distribution is most important for determining the degree of collimation",
    ", we regard a non - self - similar approach as preferable for analyzing the asymptotics of the wind .",
    "we also have the possibility of analyzing a point source of wind which subtends finite total flux .",
    "solutions for relativistic force - free flows have beeen obtained in cylindrical symmetry , either for given current profiles ( @xcite , @xcite ) or for self - consistent plasma flows both confined ( @xcite ) or unconfined ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite construct a solution by expanding in terms of the inverse of michel s magnetization parameter .",
    "cold relativistic winds have been analyzed by @xcite for the oblique split - monopole rotator .",
    "the question of the structure and formation of jets and their connection to disks have been dealt with numerically in many papers .",
    "axisymmetric stationary solutions , enforcing regularity at the light cylinder , have been obtained by @xcite .",
    "axisymmetric two - dimensional force - free stationary flows emitted by disks have been calculated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and in three dimensions by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the confinement of a star s flow by the wind from a disk has been studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied time - dependent simulations of magnetized relativistic jets .",
    "@xcite finds that in relativistic winds the collimated region may reduce to a very small region trapping but little flux .",
    "lovelace and collaborators considered the jet - disk interaction and have used the force free approximation to study the dynamics and focusing of relativistic jets ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the self - consistent response of the disk emitting the wind has also been considered in two dimensions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and in three dimensions @xcite ) .",
    "non - stationary behaviour and an avalanche type of accretion flow results .",
    "special analytical solutions valid in more or less extended regions of space have been obtained .",
    "@xcite and @xcite give some elements of our general solution below , although without the complete matching . in studying the structure of relativistic winds far from the light cylinder",
    ", @xcite adopted a procedure similar in spirit to our present work.@xcite , in an elegant asymptotic analysis , find similar slow logarithmic wind and jet acceleration . @xcite",
    "developed a particular solution in the limit of winds with a very large mass flux to magnetic flux ratio and rigid rotation .",
    "he matched a solution valid in a cylindrical polar region , in which a strong current flows , with a conical solution in the nearby region .",
    "the force balance in the axial region is between the centrifugal force and the hoop stress , implying that this region is not much broader than the light cylinder .",
    "some of our general asymptotic solutions also have such a mixed structure , although the force balance near the axis is different .",
    "@xcite insists on the importance of obtaining solutions consistent with current closure and has shown that this implies that , in regions where the electric current returns to the wind source , magnetic lines should bend toward the equator instead of bending to the axis @xcite .",
    "the solutions presented below , although their poloidal lines curve to the polar axis in most of the plasma volume , comply with this requirement .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to provide a general analytical asymptotic solution for special - relativistic jets , assuming the five first integrals of the motion to be known .",
    "it is organized as follows .",
    "section ( [ basics ] ) recalls the basics of special - relativistic , stationary axisymmetric rotating mhd winds . section ( [ secasymptofpoyntingjets ] ) deals with the field - regions .",
    "the asymptotic form of the transfield equation in field - regions is established and reduced to a simple hamilton - jacobi equation which we solve in section ( [ secsolfield ] ) .",
    "the solution in the polar boundary layer is then obtained in section ( [ secpolarbl ] ) , assuming that it encompasses little flux .",
    "our solution applies both to poynting jets and to kinetic winds by means of a wkb approximation .",
    "we match the field - solution to that which applies to the polar boundary layer .",
    "this specifies how the proper current around the polar axis varies with distance to the wind source .",
    "the case of a polar boundary layer supported by the poloidal magnetic pressure is also considered for completeness . in section ( [ secnullsurf ] )",
    "we similarly obtain and match to the field - region a solution valid in the vicinity of a null magnetic surface , namely the equatorial plane of a magnetic structure with dipolar type of symmetry . in section ( [ secshape ] )",
    "the shape of the magnetic surfaces is calculated , both in field - regions and in boundary layers , for both cases of asymptotic regime .",
    "conclusions regarding the general properties of relativistic rotating mhd winds are presented in section ( [ secconclu ] ) .",
    "we now review relativistic mhd winds and establish our notations .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 ) . unit vectors of the associated local frame of reference are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the notation @xmath8 denotes the spherical radius .",
    "the unit normal vector to the poloidal field lines , oriented towards the polar axis , is @xmath9 and the unit tangent vector to them , oriented towards increasing @xmath1 , is @xmath10 .",
    "this vector makes an angle @xmath11 with its projection on the equatorial plane .",
    "any vector field can be split into a poloidal ( subscript @xmath12 ) and a toroidal ( subscript @xmath4 ) part . due to axisymmetry",
    ", the poloidal magnetic field , @xmath13 , can be expressed in terms of a magnetic flux function , @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 a magnetic surface is generated by rotating a field line about the polar axis .",
    "it is a surface of constant value of @xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic flux through it is @xmath16 .",
    "the flow , described here in the framework of special relativity , has a local lorentz factor , @xmath17 defined by : @xmath18 we denote by @xmath19 the proper rest mass density , measured in the rest frame of the fluid .",
    "the momentum per unit proper mass is : @xmath20      a polytropic law is assumed , by which the proper gas pressure is related to the proper density by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is constant following the fluid motion and @xmath23 is the polytropic index .",
    "this relation may represent adiabatic or more complex thermodynamics .",
    "we define the function @xmath24 which is also equal to @xmath25 calculated at constant polytropic entropy @xmath22 . denoting by @xmath26 the electric charge density , by @xmath27 the electric current density and by @xmath28 the mass of the central object , the special - relativistic equation of motion can be written as @xcite : @xmath29 the relativistic form of the laws of mass conservation , isorotation ,",
    "angular momentum conservation and bernoulli are obtained as in the non - relativistic case and involve surface functions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath22 . the equations which express these four laws are : @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 note that @xmath30 includes the rest mass energy . the polytropic factor",
    "@xmath22 is a surface function because , by stationarity , flow surfaces are also magnetic surfaces .",
    "the rotation rate of the magnetic field , @xmath38 , which appears in equations ( [ defomega ] ) and ( [ defe ] ) is defined in terms of the electric field by : @xmath39 when @xmath13 is directed away from the wind source , @xmath31 is positive .",
    "since the sense of the magnetic field is immaterial , it can be assumed that this is so at the positive polar axis . for positive @xmath31",
    ", @xmath40 increases from pole to equator .",
    "we assume @xmath33 to be always positive .",
    "the toroidal variables may be eliminated by using eqs.([defomega ] ) and ( [ defl ] ) .",
    "this gives : @xmath41 @xmath42 we denote by @xmath43 the quantity @xmath44 the minus sign in eq.([defini ] ) has been included to make @xmath43 positive when @xmath31 and @xmath33 are .",
    "the physical total poloidal current is @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless we shall conveniently refer to @xmath43 as the poloidal current .",
    "since @xmath17 depends on @xmath46 , the elimination of the toroidal variables in eqs.([bthetasimple ] ) and ( [ vthetasimple ] ) is not yet complete .",
    "these expressions can however be substituted in the bernoulli equation ( [ defe ] ) which can then be solved to obtain an expression of @xmath47 in terms of poloidal variables .",
    "this eventually gives the toroidal variables in terms of poloidal ones as : @xmath48 @xmath49 for smooth continuuous solutions , these expressions must be regular where their denominator vanishes , which implies that when @xmath50 the position @xmath51 must be such that @xmath52 another way to express the special density which appears in ( [ relalfdens ] ) is to insert in it the expression ( [ relalfpoint ] ) for the corresponding radius , so obtaining a relation between the value assumed by @xmath19 at this special point and the first integrals : @xmath53 a complete elimination of toroidal variables from eq.([defe ] ) can be achieved as follows .",
    "a first expression for @xmath17 is obtained by substituting eq.([bthetasimple ] ) in eq.([defe ] ) . an independent relation for @xmath17 results from its definition in eq.([defgamma ] ) , using eqs.([defalpha ] ) and ( [ vthetasimple ] ) .",
    "eliminating @xmath17 between these two relations , an equation for @xmath19 , or any other poloidal variable , is obtained . for given values of the first integrals ,",
    "this relation , the relativistic bernoulli equation , can be used to find this poloidal variable as a function of position along the magnetic surface @xmath40 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath54 the variable : @xmath55 and by @xmath56 the function : @xmath57 simple algebra shows that the relativistic bernoulli equation can be then written as : @xmath58 this equation is satisfied at the relativistic alfvn point , as can be shown from eqs.([relalfpoint])-([relalfdensofa ] ) .",
    "again , a smooth solution of eq.([bernie ] ) requires that the first integrals satisfy regularity conditions by passing critical points .",
    "the transfield equation is the projection of the equation of motion on the normal to magnetic surfaces .",
    "it can be obtained by using methods similar to those used in the classical case @xcite , giving : @xmath59 - { 1\\over \\mu_0 \\rho r } \\left [ { \\partial \\over \\partial z } { 1 \\over r } { \\partial a \\over \\partial z } + { \\partial \\over \\partial r } { 1 \\over r } { \\partial a \\over \\partial r } \\right ] \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad & \\nonumber\\\\ + { { \\omega^2 } \\over { \\mu_0 \\rho c^2 } }   \\left [ { \\partial^2 a \\over \\partial z^2}+ { 1 \\over r } { \\partial \\over \\partial r } r { \\partial a \\over \\partial r } + { \\omega ' \\over \\omega } \\vert \\nabla a \\vert^2 \\right ]     =   \\gamma e'(a ) - { { q'(a )   \\rho^{\\gamma -1 } } \\over { \\gamma - 1 } } - { { \\gamma}\\over{\\gamma - 1 } } { { u_p^2}\\over{c^2 } }   { { \\vec{\\nabla}a \\cdot \\vec{\\nabla}(q \\rho^{\\gamma -1 } )   } \\over { \\vert \\nabla a \\vert^2 } } & \\nonumber\\\\ + { \\alpha'\\over \\alpha}{\\mu_0 \\alpha^2 \\rho\\over r^2 } \\left({l- \\gamma \\xi r^2 \\omega \\over \\mu_0 \\alpha^2 \\xi - \\rho}\\right)^2 - { { \\rho } \\over { r^2 \\xi } } ( l ' - \\gamma \\xi r^2 \\omega ' ) \\left ( { l - \\gamma \\xi r^2 \\omega \\over \\mu_0 \\alpha^2   \\xi - \\rho}\\right ) - { l l ' \\over r^2 \\xi } \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad & \\label{reltf } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find that , in comparison of the non - relativistic transfield equation , eq.([reltf ] ) has an additional second order term proportional to @xmath60 on its left hand side which represents the cross - field component of the electric force .",
    "the gas pressure terms on the right hand side differ slightly from those obtained by li ( 1993 ) , who defined the function @xmath61 as being @xmath62 .",
    "we prefered the definition ( [ defxi ] ) which coincides with that of li when the entropy @xmath63 is independent of @xmath40 .",
    "toroidal variables , still implicit in @xmath17 , can be eliminated entirely by using the expression for the lorentz factor in terms of poloidal variables ( see section [ bernandtf ] ) .",
    "the curvature of poloidal field lines is given by : @xmath64 using the relation @xmath65 the following equation , equivalent to eq.([reltf ] ) , is obtained : @xmath66 the forces associated with the terms on the right hand side are the same as for classical dynamics , except for the very last one which is part of the projection of the electric force normal to the magnetic surface .",
    "another part of this electric force appears as a term proportional to @xmath67 on the left hand side of eq.([reltfcurvform ] ) .",
    "the force - free limit applies in the case of very large magnetization .",
    "it corresponds to a limit in which the inertia @xmath19 approaches zero . by eq.([defalpha ] ) this implies that @xmath31 approaches zero such that @xmath68 remains finite . in this limit @xmath61 , given by eq.([defxi ] )",
    "reduces to unity and @xmath69 .",
    "eqs.([relalfdensofa]),([defl]),([defe ] ) then imply that the energy is all in poynting form . because the ordering between @xmath19 and the critical density @xmath70 is opposite in the asymptotic limit , the latter is entirely out of the scope of the force - free approximation .",
    "the asymptotic limit applies to a state of the flow reached in regions much further away from the wind source than the limit down to which the force free approximation is valid . nevertheless , the asymptotic regime is such that the component of the lorentz force perpendicular to magnetic surfaces vanishes , except at boundary layers .",
    "there is no contradiction here @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic property occurs because the least negligible asymptotic forces normal to the field are electromagnetic .",
    "this property does not result from any _ a priori _ assumed dominance of electromagnetic forces over all the other forces present .",
    "the vanishing of the normal component of the electromagnetic force simply results from the wind dynamics . between any near - source region",
    "in which force free conditions apply ( because of strong magnetization ) and the asymptotic domain ( in which the component of the electromagnetic force perpendicular to the field vanishes as a consequence of the dynamics ) , an intermediate non - force - free region must exist . in this intermediate non - force - free region , currents cross magnetic surfaces and plasma is accelerated .",
    "the conservation of poloidal current on a magnetic surface ( which , under force - free conditions , apply near the wind source ) do not retain validity continuously out to the asymptotic domain .",
    "it is instructive to analyze how the inertia - less limit turns the transfield equation ( [ reltf ] ) into the well known force - free relativistic wind equation . in the inertia - less limit , eq.([defl ] ) , multiplied by @xmath31 , reduces to @xmath71 , where , as @xmath31 approaches zero , @xmath72 approaches the finite limit @xmath73 which means that the poloidal current follows magnetic surfaces in the force - free regions and the associated lorentz force has no component along the magnetic field . multiplying eq.([defe ] ) by @xmath31 and taking the limit of vanishing @xmath31 leads to @xmath74 , where it is meant that @xmath75 approaches a finite limit @xmath12 as @xmath31 approaches zero .",
    "this implies that the energy flux is all in poynting form .",
    "this relation can be restated as @xmath76 .",
    "the point @xmath0 defined by eq.([relalfpoint ] ) reduces in this case to the light cylinder radius @xmath77 . in the force - free limit , eq.([reltf ] ) should be expanded in @xmath19 and @xmath31 to an appropriate order , to take account of the cancellation of the dominant terms .",
    "the inertial terms on the left hand side of eq.([reltf ] ) become negligible .",
    "the pressure terms disappear from its right hand side and @xmath78 approximately equals @xmath43 .",
    "one is eventually left with the well known force - free pulsar wind equation @xcite : @xmath79",
    "let us compare the terms on the right of eq.([reltf ] ) in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the gravity term and the centrifugal force term , which declines as @xmath80 , become negligible , and the pressure term becomes very small , so that @xmath61 approaches unity .",
    "the electric force remains of the same order as the hoop stress , though .",
    "the asymptotic form of the relativistic transfield equation is then : @xmath81 eq.([defe ] ) shows that , on a given magnetic surface , @xmath82 is bounded at large distances and eqs.([bthetasimple ] ) and ( [ defalpha ] ) show that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are also bounded .",
    "when they approach finite limits , the hoop stress term in eq.([relasstfcomplete ] ) decreases as @xmath85 , as does the electric force .",
    "both the poloidal magnetic pressure and the gas pressure decrease more rapidly with @xmath0 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the inertia force associated with the curvature of the poloidal motion on the left of eq.([relasstfcomplete ] ) must decrease faster than @xmath85 .",
    "it becomes negligible compared to the hoop stress and electric force .",
    "the asymptotic form of the transfield equation becomes : @xmath86 eq.([relasstfoutofbl ] ) generalizes to the relativistic case our earlier non - relativistic result @xcite .",
    "adding to the left hand side of eq.([relasstfoutofbl ] ) that negligible part of the electric force which is proportional to the curvature of poloidal field lines the relation , we find : @xmath87",
    "so , the component of the electromagnetic force normal to the magnetic surface asymptotically vanishes on flared surfaces .",
    "this does not imply a strictly force - free situation since eq.([forcefreeperp ] ) is asymptotically satisfied by the vanishing of each of its terms separately and holds only perpendicular to field lines .",
    "we refer to regions where eq.([relasstfoutofbl ] ) holds true as field - regions of the asymptotic domain .",
    "the pressure force becomes significant near the polar axis and near neutral magnetic surfaces , where the electromagnetic force vanishes .",
    "eq.([relasstfoutofbl ] ) can be integrated following orthogonal trajectories to magnetic surfaces .",
    "let @xmath88 label one such orthogonal trajectory .",
    "we define @xmath88 as being the distance to the origin of the point where this orthogonal trajectory meets the polar axis .",
    "the integrated form of eq.([relasstfoutofbl ] ) is : @xmath89 @xmath90 is independent of @xmath40 . using eq.([omegaandefield ] ) and noting that @xmath91 in the large-@xmath0 limit , eq.([relkassgeneral ] ) can also be written as : @xmath92 the scalar invariant of the electromagnetic field @xmath93 appears on the left of this equation . from the asymptotic form of eqs.([defalpha ] ) and ( [ bthetasimple ] ) , the toroidal field can be expressed in terms of poloidal variables as : @xmath94 when used in eq.([relkassgeneral ] ) this gives : @xmath95 then , @xmath96 is positive and can be written as : @xmath97 @xmath98 has the dimension of an electric current . in the non - relativistic case",
    "the quantity which becomes independent of @xmath40 in field - regions is the total poloidal electric current @xmath43 .",
    "eq.([k2asfunctionofi2 ] ) indicates that the situation is different in a relativistic plasma flow . @xmath99 and",
    "@xmath43 are related by ( chiueh et al .",
    "( 1991 ) ) : @xmath100 this defines @xmath99 as an algebraic quantity having the sign of @xmath43 ( see eqs.([defini ] ) and ( [ rbthetaass ] ) ) .",
    "since the azimuthal velocity asymptotically approaches zero , the terminal lorentz factor , @xmath101 , refers to the terminal poloidal velocity @xmath102 .",
    "the bernoulli equation ( [ defe ] ) becomes in the same limit : @xmath103 eqs.([iversusk ] ) and ( [ gammainftyversuseandi ] ) provide expressions for the current @xmath43 and the momentum @xmath104 in terms of @xmath98 and the first integrals : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath99 is the poloidal current observed in a rest frame where the poloidal motion vanishes .",
    "this can be seen by transforming from the laboratory frame to a frame moving with the fluid at the poloidal velocity @xmath107 along the direction of the poloidal field .",
    "the azimuthal magnetic field is given by eq.([rbthetaass ] ) and the electric field by eq.([omegaandefield ] ) .",
    "@xmath99 is equal to : @xmath108 in the moving fluid rest frame , the electric field vanishes , while the azimuthal magnetic field is : @xmath109 the arc length element @xmath110 remains invariant in the transformation , so that : @xmath111 this shows that @xmath99 is negatively proportional to the current enclosed by a circle of radius @xmath0 carried by the fluid motion .",
    "we refer to @xmath99 as the proper current .",
    "eq.([relasstfcomplete ] ) shows that the electromagnetic force is proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath99 vanishes with @xmath43 , this force yields to pressure at boundary layers around null surfaces and near the polar axis .",
    "however , since the pressure is weak , the thickness of the boundary layers must be small . using eq.([rbthetaass ] ) , eq.([relasstfcomplete ] ) reduces to : @xmath113 the proper current @xmath99 then has the following profile along an orthogonal trajectory : from zero at the polar axis , it quickly rises to a non - zero value at the edge of the circum - polar boundary layer , then stays constant and steeply returns to zero through a boundary layer about the next null surface .",
    "the current system closes exactly in cells bordered by null surfaces .",

    "<S> we consider relativistic , stationary , axisymmetric , polytropic , unconfined , perfect mhd winds , assuming their five lagrangian first integrals to be known . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic structure consists of field - regions bordered by boundary layers along the polar axis and at null surfaces , such as the equatorial plane , which have the structure of charged column or sheet pinches supported by plasma or magnetic poloidal pressure . in each field - region cell , </S>",
    "<S> the proper current ( defined here as the ratio of the asymptotic poloidal current to the asymptotic lorentz factor ) remains constant . </S>",
    "<S> our solution is given in the form of matched asymptotic solutions separately valid outside and inside the boundary layers . </S>",
    "<S> an hamilton - jacobi equation , or equivalently a grad - shafranov equation , gives the asymptotic structure in the field - regions of winds which carry poynting flux to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> an important consistency relation is found to exist between axial pressure , axial current and asymptotic lorentz factor . </S>",
    "<S> we similarly derive wkb - type analytic solutions for winds which are kinetic - energy dominated at infinity and whose magnetic surfaces focus to paraboloids . the density on the axis in the polar boundary column is shown to slowly fall off as a negative power of the logarithm of the distance to the wind source . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry of magnetic surfaces in all parts of the asymptotic domain , including boundary layers , is explicitly deduced in terms of the first - integrals . </S>"
