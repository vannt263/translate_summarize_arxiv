    "flares on m dwarfs are notorious for producing dramatic outbursts in the near - uv and optical ( white light ) continuum .",

    ", we have begun a detailed investigation at wavelengths near the balmer jump using new , time - resolved flare spectra and models .",
    "on ut 2009 january 16 , we observed an incredible flare on the dm4.5e star yz cmi , obtaining high - cadence near - uv / optical ( 3350@xmath49260  ) spectra and simultaneous @xmath5-band photometry from the arc 3.5-m and nmsu 1-m telescopes at apo ( see ( * ? ? ? * kowalski et al .",
    "2010 ) ; hereafter k10 ) .",
    "the spectra cover the section of the flare decay shown in figure 1(a ) , which consists of several secondary flare peaks .",
    "the k10 analysis revealed two continuum components in the flare spectra : a balmer continuum in emission as predicted by the rhd models and a hot ( @xmath6@xmath710,000 k ) , compact blackbody as seen in previous flare observations .",
    "-band photometry is shown for the time during which spectra were obtained ( see k10 for the complete light curve of the flare ) .",
    "the inset displays averaged spectra immediately before a secondary flare ( grey , f0 ) , 2.2 min into the rise phase ( black , f1 ) , and during quiescence ( dashed line ) .",

    "during the secondary flares , k10 found that the time evolution of the balmer continuum and balmer line fluxes are anti - correlated with the areal coverage of the @xmath8 k blackbody component .",
    "for example , a secondary flare rise begins at @xmath9 min and lasts @xmath75 min , resulting in an apparent decrease by 40% in the balmer continuum flux and an increase by a factor of nearly 2 in the area of the blackbody - emitting region .",
    "the total flare spectra at two times are shown in the inset in figure 1(a ) .",
    "the times correspond to immediately before the secondary flare rise ( f0 ; @xmath10 min ) and 2.2 min into the secondary flare rise ( f1 ; @xmath11 min ) .",
    "the spectra are clearly very complex , consisting of line and continuum emission from both previously heated and newly formed flare regions , in addition to molecular band absorption from the surrounding non - flaring photosphere .",
    "we isolate the newly formed flare emission by subtracting the f0 spectrum from the f1 spectrum .",
    "the striking features of this subtracted flare spectrum ( figure 1b ) include a balmer continuum and lines in absorption , in contrast to the total flare spectrum in which the balmer continuum is in emission .",
    "using continuum windows from 4000@xmath46500  , the spectrum is fit by a blackbody with @xmath12 16,500 k. we show the spectrum of the a0 v star vega ( from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bohlin 2007 ) ) in figure 1(b ) to highlight the remarkably similar characteristics with the spectrum of an early - type star .",
    "we model the flare spectrum by placing a hot spot , represented by a gaussian temperature bump with peak temperature of 20,000 k , deep ( log@xmath13 col mass @xmath14 g @xmath15 ) in the quiescent m dwarf atmosphere ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the emergent radiation is calculated with the static nlte code rh ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* uitenbroek 2001 ) ) with a 5 level ( plus continuum ) hydrogen atom .",
    "we initially iterate to solve for the nlte background opacities for hydrogen , and we also consider some relevant molecular species that include hydrogen ( e.g. , h@xmath16 ) .",
    "the emergent hot spot spectrum is shown in figure 2(b ) .",
    "the model spectrum has a blackbody temperature of @xmath718,000 k , and the balmer continuum and lines are in absorption , similar to the subtracted flare spectrum . in future work",
    ", we will include helium and metallic transitions , additional levels in the hydrogen atom , and refined electron densities .",
    "we will also further constrain the parameters and time evolution of the hot spot .",
    "we find that newly formed emission during a secondary flare resembles the spectrum of an early - type star , such as vega . modelling the spectrum phenomonologically by placing a hot spot near the quiescent m dwarf photosphere adequately reproduces the observed spectral shape and hydrogen absorption features . in a future work",
    ", we will show how combining all flare continuum components reproduces the _ total _ flare spectrum , thereby providing an explanation for the anti - correlation in the time evolution between the hydrogen emission and blackbody components .",
    "current , self - consistent 1d rhd models of stellar flares predict that the photosphere is heated by only @xmath71200 k , predominantly due to backwarming from the flare chromosphere ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* allred et al .",
    "heating of deep layers by the amount needed to produce a @xmath17@xmath18 k hot spot is clearly not achieved by a solar - type non - thermal electron beam as energetic as 10@xmath19 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath20 .",
    "more spectral observations of flares with time resolution much less than the rise time , and with spectral coverage farther into the near - uv , are needed to characterize the ubiquity of the phenomena presented in this work .",
    "the presentation of this paper in the iau symposium 273 was possible due to partial support from the national science foundation grant numbers atm 0548260 , ast 0968672 , ast 0807205 and nasa - living with a star grant number 09-lwstrt09 - 0039 .",
