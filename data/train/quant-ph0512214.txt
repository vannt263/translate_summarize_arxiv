    "the investigation of the role of entanglement in quantum and classical phase transitions , and more generally the role of entanglement in many - body quantum systems is one of the hottest interdisciplinary areas on the borders between quantum information , quantum optics , atomic , molecular , and condensed matter physics .",
    "initially the studies of entanglement in many - body systems have been motivated by the possibility of employing entanglement for quantum computation in optical lattices @xcite , or precision measurements with bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "recently , several lines of research have been followed :    * studies of local entanglement in spin systems @xcite , and more generally in various many - body systems ( such as linear chains , see for instance @xcite ) , with particular attention to the role of entanglement in phase transitions .",
    "* studies of the entropy of blocks of spins and the related `` area law '' @xcite , indicating weak entanglement of blocks , and effects of criticality @xcite .",
    "* studies of localisable entanglement and entanglement correlation length that diverges at the critical point @xcite and majorizes the standard correlation length ( see also @xcite ) . in particular , it has been shown that the localisable entanglement ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is bounded from above by the entanglement of assistance @xcite and from below by correlation functions .",
    "it follows directly from these bounds that one can define an entanglement correlation length that diverges in quantum critical systems .",
    "* studies of multipartite entanglement in many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "* studies of dynamics and generation of entanglement in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , implementations of the `` one - way quantum computer '' and short range teleportation @xcite of an unknown state has been proposed by using the dynamics of spin systems in refs .",
    "* studies of quantum information and entanglement theory inspired numerical codes to simulate quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a different approach to the study of entanglement in many - body systems has been proposed in two papers by wootters and coworkers @xcite . in these papers , instead of looking at a specific hamiltonian , the authors asked the fundamental question `` what is the maximal entanglement between two neighboring sites of an entangled ring with translational invariance ? '' here , an entangled ring is a chain of spins with periodic boundary conditions . due to the so - called `` monogamy of entanglement '' it is impossible for a site to be maximally entangled with both its neighbors : shared entanglement is always less than maximal @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the question of the upper limit for the nearest neighbor ( nn ) entanglement was simplified by introducing two additional restrictions on the allowed states :    * the state of @xmath1 spins 1/2 is an eigenstate of the @xmath2-component of the total spin ( i.e. it has a fixed number of `` down '' spins @xmath3 )  : since we will be optimizing a convex function , such a mixture can not be optimal .",
    "thus restriction ( i ) can be replaced with the formally weaker demand that the density operator commutes with the @xmath2-component of the total spin  @xcite . ] .",
    "* neighboring spins can not both be `` down '' .",
    "obviously , one can equally well study the same problem in terms of spins `` up '' , when @xmath4 .",
    "both restrictions are based on an educated guess for the optimal states for the general problem .",

    "in fact , already in ref .  @xcite it was shown that for all even @xmath1 the ground state of a heisenberg spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic ring maximizes the concurrence among the zero magnetization ( @xmath10 ) states although it violates restriction ( ii ) .    by optimizing with respect to @xmath5",

    "in this paper we have studied the question posed by oconnor and wootters concerning translationally invariant states of @xmath1 qubits with maximal nearest neighbor ( nn ) concurrence .",
    "we have answered this question for @xmath0 using the mapping of the problem onto the search for ground states of a certain family of `` parent '' hamiltonians , described by the xxz model . using the analytic bethe ansatz solutions of the xxz model in the limit @xmath13 ( combining analytic results of low order perturbation theory and a numerical calculation of the 14th order perturbation theory ) we have proved that",
    ": ( i ) for a given number of spins `` down '' , i.e. a given magnetization @xmath67 larger than @xmath158 , the states that maximize the nn concurrence coincide with the ones obtained by oconnor and wootters , i.e. do not have nn pairs of spins `` down '' ; ( ii ) for small magnetizations , more explicitly for @xmath159 , the states that maximize the nn concurrence do contain nearest neighbor pairs of spins `` down '' ; ( iii ) in particular , the state that maximizes the nn concurrence without constraint on @xmath67 belongs to the family introduced by oconnor and wootters .",
    "our results shed more light on the subtle relations between entanglement in spin 1/2 models and the ferromagnetic / anti - ferromagnetic character of spin - spin interactions . in the appendix we present some simple bounds on the optimal magnetic field that corresponds to the maximal nn concurrence .",

    "if one keeps @xmath67 fixed , and use @xmath78 to parameterize the @xmath72-curve instead of @xmath72 , one gets : @xmath160    - y\\nonumber\\\\    & = & 2\\frac{\\mathcal{h}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{h}^2 + 1 } } p    + \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{h}}{\\sqrt{\\mathcal{h}^2 + 1}}-1\\right)y,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the probability of two neighboring spins being both `` down '' .      using a simple bound on @xmath161 , @xmath167 we obtain a lower bound on @xmath164 : @xmath168 this bound does not work well for @xmath169 , because it gives a finite bound , maximized for @xmath170 when we find @xmath171 , whereas we know that in this regime of @xmath67 s @xmath172 .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath156 , both the optimal @xmath157 ( i.e. @xmath77 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : h_num ] ) , as well as the optimal @xmath164 attain finite values , so that the bound might become more useful .",
    "in particular , the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : h_num ] suggest that as @xmath67 approaches zero , the optimal @xmath157 approaches 1 more or less linearly , as @xmath173 , which in turn implies that the optimal @xmath77 approaches @xmath106 as @xmath174 .",
    "thus for small @xmath67 and small @xmath175 , the bound becomes @xmath176 , which already is not obvious ( compare fig .  [",
