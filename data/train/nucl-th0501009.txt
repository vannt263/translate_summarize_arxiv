    "typically , linear response theory equations are derived by adding a specific time - dependent perturbing function to the hamiltonian , which is usually harmonic in time , resulting in a set of rpa - like equations .",

    "a specific time - dependent perturbing external piece is added to the static hamiltonian to give a time - dependent total hamiltonian , @xmath3 .",
    "a static hartree - fock solution is then time - evolved using this @xmath3 in a time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) calculation . the time - dependent result is then fourier transformed to give the response of the system for all energies . in this scheme one recovers both the response spectrum as well as the total transition probability amplitude corresponding to a given specific collective mode .",
    "similar analyses of the long - time evolution of tdhf equations to study collective vibrations have been utilized in the past @xcite , as well as extensions to study the damping of giant resonances @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the dynamical response calculation is constructed directly on top of a static hartree - fock calculation and hence the static and dynamical calculations are calculated using the same hamiltonian description .",
    "therefore there is a complete consistency between the static ground state of the system and the response calculations .",
    "one can then provide a coherent description of static properties of nuclei and of dynamical properties .",

    "using infinitesimal time increments , the time - evolution operator is approximated by @xmath50 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantity @xmath51 is evaluated by repeated operations of @xmath52 upon the wave functions .",
    "the fluctuations in the isoscalar axial quadrupole moment as a function of time are shown for @xmath0o , @xmath2s , and @xmath1ca using the skm@xmath53 interaction .",

    "the static and time - dependent hartree - fock calculations are performed using a collocation spline basis in a three - dimensional lattice configuration .",
    "basis - splines allow for the use of a lattice grid representation of the nucleus , which is much easier to use than alternate basis techniques , such as multi - dimensional harmonic oscillators . also , for studies of exotic nuclei , because of weak binding , the density distributions tend to extend to large distances and hence one finds a large sensitivity to a harmonic oscillator basis due to the unphysical description of continuum states , while for a lattice grid representation one needs to simply increase the size of the box .",
    "traditional grid representations typically use finite difference techniques to represent the gradient operator .",
    "collocation basis - splines allow for the gradient operator to be represented by its action upon a basis function in a matrix form .",
    "thus the collocation method gives a much more accurate representation of the gradient , while maintaining the convenience of a lattice grid and hence provides a much more accurate calculation in the end @xcite .    the imaginary part of the response function corresponding to the isoscalar quadrupole moment is shown for @xmath0o using three different skyrme force parametrizations , where the skm@xmath53 , sgii and skii versions are shown in the upper , middle and lower panels , respectively .",

    "we have performed the usual tests for assuring convergence with respect to the numerical box size and the number of collocation points .",
    "typically a 7th order b - spline is used in a @xmath58 box with @xmath59 grid points .",
    "the calculation can be performed with or without assuming time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the collective linear response may involve particle - hole interactions which are spin - dependent and not time - reversal symmetric .",
    "therefore , for the correct collective content to be included one should not impose time - reversal symmetry in the linear response calculations @xcite . in the results presented in this paper time - reversal symmetry",
    "is not imposed . in a comparison",
    "it is found that imposing time - reversal symmetry causes small shifts in the position of the collective modes on the order of @xmath60  mev .",
    "calculations of isovector dipole ; isovector and isoscalar octupole ; and isoscalar quadrupole collective modes are performed for @xmath0o , @xmath2s , and @xmath1ca using several parameterizations of the skyrme interaction . here the parameterizations known as skii @xcite , skm@xmath53 @xcite and sgii @xcite are used for comparisons .",
    "the exponent of the density in the density - dependent term in skii is @xmath61 , while for skm@xmath53 and sgii this exponent is @xmath62 .",
    "this causes the skii force to produce a rather large nuclear matter incompressibility , while the skm@xmath53 and sgii forces produce more realistic compression properties .",
    "also the skm@xmath53 and sgii forces allow for more stable static hartree - fock and tdhf computations .",
    "the static hartree - fock calculations converge more easily and rapidly for skm@xmath53 and sgii than for ski , skii or skiii .",
    "a time step of @xmath63  fm / c is used for the calculation .",
    "it is found that one can perform the time evolution for up to 32768 time steps without appreciable dissipation .",
    "the results shown here use 16384 time steps for a maximum time of @xmath64  fm / c .",
    "fft results for @xmath0o using three different numbers of time steps .",
    "the case when the number of time steps equals an exact power of two ( 32768 ) is clearly the better converged result , showing almost no positive values . ]",
    "reasonable results are obtained if the parameter @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.17 ] ) is chosen to fall in the range @xmath65 . by varying the value of @xmath43 ,",
    "the amplitude of the time - dependent density fluctuation then scales proportionally to @xmath43 , thus indicating that we are well within the linear regime of the theory .",
    "the linear response calculations require well converged initial static hf solutions . to test for the convergence of the static hf calculation the energy fluctuation , which is the variance of @xmath34 ,",
    "is minimized .",
    "the energy fluctuation is defined as @xmath66 which measures how close the wave functions are to being eigenstates of @xmath34 .",
    "this measure of convergence is very sensitive to the eigensolutions and is independent of the iteration step size .",
    "for @xmath0o it was found that static hf solutions with energy fluctuation less than about @xmath67 provided adequate starting points for the dynamic calculation , although the smaller the energy fluctuation the better .",
    "the dynamic calculations involve using eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.19 ] ) to evolve the system .",
    "since @xmath68 is an unitary operator , the orthonormality of the system is preserved , therefore it is not necessary to re - orthogonalize the solutions after every time - step .",
    "the stability of the calculation is checked by testing the preservation of the norm of each wave function . the number of terms in the expansion of the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.19 ] ) is determined by requiring the norm to be preserved to a certain accuracy ( typically to @xmath69 ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the response function corresponding to the isoscalar quadrupole moment is shown for @xmath1ca using two different skyrme force parametrizations , skm@xmath53 and sgii . ]    the time - dependent perturbing part of the hamiltonian is evaluated when the exponential term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.17 ] ) is greater than some small number , @xmath70 .",
    "since it is not difficult to evaluate the action of the external part of the hamiltonian on the wave function , @xmath70 is chosen to be very small , ( @xmath71 ) . to allow the fourier transform of @xmath10 to be evaluated easily ,",
    "it is necessary to integrate @xmath72 from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and hence we would like the entire gaussian of the perturbing function , @xmath10 , to be included into the time evolution to the desired accuracy .",
    "the parameter @xmath75 is therefore chosen such that the complete nonzero contribution of the time - dependent perturbation is included @xmath76      for the study of the isoscalar quadrupole moment , the perturbing function @xmath9 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.3 ] ) , is chosen to be the mass quadrupole moment , @xmath77 .",
    "it turns out that other even multipole modes are also excited at the same time ( _ i.e. _ @xmath78 , @xmath79 , ... ) .",
    "one can therefore study the effect of the coupling between the different excitation modes .",
    "the same holds true for the odd multipoles .",
    "this is due to the nonlinear response effects present in the tdhf time evolution @xcite .",
    "the quadrupole collective resonances are calculated for @xmath0o using three different skyrme force parameterizations for comparisons .",
    "two different size grids ( @xmath80 ) were used inside a ( @xmath81  fm)@xmath82 cartesian box along with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the smallest oscillation is about @xmath84  fm / c .",
    "a fast fourier transform ( fft ) is used to calculate the fourier transform of @xmath85 to give @xmath86 .",
    "the time - dependent perturbation function , @xmath87 can then be easily factored out using eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.15 ] ) .",
    "one can use the analytic expression for @xmath87 or use a numerical fft calculation , where the difference between the two methods ends up being negligible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the quadrupole responses for @xmath0o are shown for the three different skyrme cases .",

    "( [ eq:4.1 ] ) is fourier transformed and divided by @xmath87 .",
    "recalling eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.16 ] ) , this quantity is derived to be a negative definite quantity .",
    "the skm@xmath53 results for @xmath0o reflect this property very well in fig .",
    "we observe a sharp peak at about @xmath88  mev and a response which is almost purely negative .",
    "the side peaks , which are much less prominent , may not represent physical effects , but may be due to the construction of the continuum . in performing fft transformations",
    "we find it to be important to have the number of points to be a power of two . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we demonstrate this by plotting the response function for three different choices for the total number of time steps which differ from each other by only 20 points each . as one can see the case for 32768 points results in almost no positive values , indicating good convergence .",
    "the three cases give similar pole structures , which are near the experimental isoscalar quadrupole giant resonance .",
    "the experimental peak is centered at an energy of @xmath89  mev with a width of about @xmath90  mev @xcite .",
    "the resonance calculated with the sgii skyrme parametrization is closest to the experimental result , although skm@xmath53 is also fairly close .",
    "the skii parametrization poorly represents the data , but this force is known to give a bad representation of the collective nuclear properties .",
    "however , for the skii parametrization we were able to compare our results for @xmath0o to the continuum rpa calculations of @xcite .",
    "we find that the difference between the two calculations is less than 2% for the l=2 , 3 , and 4 modes .",
    "the difference may be due to the omission of the spin - orbit term in the continuum rpa calculations .",
    "we find the closest agreement for the hexadecupole mode , where both calculations give a peak energy of 28.2 mev .",
    "the widths of resonances are not accurately reproduced , because the continuum is included into the calculation in an approximate fashion and higher order correlations are missing in the tdhf approach . since the calculations are performed in a box , the continuum is represented in terms of discrete pseudo - continuum states , whose density is sensitive to the size of the box .",
    "a larger box size is expected to better represent the continuum with a higher density of pseudo - continuum states .",
    "the property represented in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3.16 ] ) of being purely negative is not strictly reflected by the sgii nor the skii results .",
    "one can see that this property is approximately reflected , but it is clear the convergence of the solution for these two cases is not nearly as good as for the skm@xmath53 case .    the imaginary part of the response function corresponding to the isoscalar and isovector octupole , and isovector dipole are shown for @xmath0o using the skm@xmath53 force . ]",
    "an alternate check of the calculation is the energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) .",
    "this provides a stringent test of the normalization and is derivable from the static hamiltonian .",
    "the skm@xmath53 result gives @xmath91 of the ewsr , indicating excellent convergence .",
    "for sgii and skii the linear response results give @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the ewsr , respectively , indicating a lack of convergence for these results .",
    "the result for the sgii calculation is particular puzzling , since it is expected that the skm@xmath53 and sgii interactions should be similar in behavior .",
    "the violations of the two convergence tests may be due to coupling to other collective modes , or may be due to numerical inconsistencies .",
    "we have investigated the sgii result by varying the size of the box , while keeping the grid spacing the same .",
    "we have found that a slightly larger box , ( -14,+14 ) fm , seems to be closer to being purely negative .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the quadrupole strength function for @xmath1ca using two different skyrme parameterizations . in this case",
    "skm@xmath53 and sgii show a peak at about 17 mev .",
    "we also note the strength of the peak .",
    "in this case the resonance consumes all of the ewsr . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the same quantity for @xmath2s using the skyrme m@xmath53 force . in this case",
    "we observe multiple structures in the giant quadrupole resonance ; the energy splitting arises from the prolate quadrupole deformation of the nuclear ground state in this system .",
    "the resonant structure of the hexadecupole moment , @xmath78 , can also be calculated at the same time as the quadrupole moment .",
    "this corresponds to the coupling between the quadrupole and the hexadecupole collective modes . in this case",
    "if one were to include both @xmath94 and @xmath78 into the external time - perturbing piece of the total hamiltonian , then this result corresponds to the coupling term :    @xmath95    here @xmath96 and @xmath97 . for the pure hexadecupole giant",
    "resonance both @xmath98 and @xmath99 must be made equal to @xmath78 .",
    "in general , mixed mode analysis produces strength functions with less pronounced peaks and can be used when computational time saving is necessary .",
    "the imaginary part of the response function corresponding to the isoscalar and isovector octupole , and isovector dipole are shown for @xmath0o using the sgii force . ]",
    "the octupole and dipole giant resonances are not symmetric about the @xmath100 plane and hence these nodes do not couple with the symmetric quadrupole and hexadecupole modes .",

    "7 the same quantities are again plotted using the sgii force .",
    "the isoscalar octupole mode shows three sharp resonance structures at about @xmath102  mev , @xmath103  mev , and @xmath104  mev , for the skm@xmath53 force , whereas the sgii resonances are at the slightly higher energies .",
    "these three peaks are also found in a spherical rpa calculation using the same effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the spherical calculation finds an additional broad peak for skm@xmath53 and sgii centered at an energy of about @xmath105  mev .",
    "this peak is weaker than the 3 peaks at lower energies and is not observed in the three - dimensional linear response calculation . in fig .",
    "6 one can see that the response is approximately purely negative , but that there are some violations of this feature .",
    "the isovector octupole response is less clear than the other collective modes .",
    "it is also possible that resonances seen in the isoscalar octupole response may also appear in the isovector response due to couplings . in this case",
    "the strength of the peak is expected to be most prominent in its primary channel .",
    "this is most easily observed in fig .  7 for the sgii force .",
    "in this case the lowest resonances at about @xmath106  mev and at @xmath107  mev are very close to the lowest peaks in the isoscalar case but with substantially reduced strength , whereas the most prominent isovector peak is at about @xmath88  mev .",
    "the sorting of the isoscalar versus isovector mode is more complicated for the skm@xmath53 force .",
    "the isovector dipole response resulting from the linear response calculations is not as prominent as the isoscalar responses .",
    "this is most likely due to the absence of a strong collective dipole resonance for this nucleus . for the skm@xmath53 case ,",
    "there are some peaks centered around @xmath108  mev , while for sgii the peaks range about @xmath109  mev .",
    "a method for evaluating the linear response theory using tdhf is formally developed and implemented .",
