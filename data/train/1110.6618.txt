    "otherwise , the distinct conjugacy classes of full image elements of @xmath67 are represented by @xmath248      multiplying @xmath250 by @xmath251 if necessary we may assume @xmath252 , and denote the resulting group by @xmath253 .",
    "we have @xmath254 the two generators commuting is equivalent to @xmath255 which , given any @xmath256 , has two solutions for @xmath257 .",
    "this yields at most @xmath236 half image subgroups . moreover , since any solution of ( [ eq : b ] ) automatically satisfies @xmath258 we claim that @xmath259 has order @xmath47 ( the minimal possible ) , so that any such @xmath253 really does represent an element of @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , @xmath260 when @xmath261 , @xmath262 the three terms on the right have 2-adic valuations @xmath263 , @xmath264 and @xmath265 respectively , so the product is a multiple of @xmath234 .",
    "when @xmath266 , the same computation together with lemma [ lem : ladicval ] proves that @xmath267 is a multiple of @xmath234 , as required .",
    "thus , the half image subgroups of @xmath19 are precisely @xmath253 for any solution @xmath268 of ( [ eq : b ] ) .      because conjugation by @xmath139 acts on the non - central involutions of @xmath20 as @xmath272 , @xmath141 odd , and conjugation by @xmath25 maps @xmath273 , all non - central involutions of @xmath20 are @xmath19-conjugate .",
    "because the orbit of @xmath274 has length @xmath234 , its centraliser has size @xmath145 , so it must be @xmath275 .",
    "therefore the normaliser of @xmath253 is of the same size ( a normalising element must fix @xmath276 ) , so its orbit has size @xmath234 as well .",
    "[ lem : halffull ] if @xmath131 , then the unique full image subgroup of @xmath19 that intersects a half image subgroup in an index 2 subgroup is @xmath11 . if @xmath277 , then there are no such full image subgroups",
    ".    we always have the full image group @xmath278 .",
    "the unique index 2 subgroup of @xmath11 is a subgroup of a half image group if and only if @xmath279 is a solution of ( [ eq : b ] ) ( for some @xmath269 ) , which it is if and only if @xmath280 .            first ,",
    "note that two half image groups always generate together at most the preimage of the unique index 2 subgroup of @xmath74 , so they always lie in the same connected component of the graph @xmath83 .",
    "a full image group and a half image group together always generate all of @xmath19 ( the group they generate contains a non - central involution of @xmath20 and a complement to @xmath20 in @xmath19 , hence also @xmath25 , since @xmath49 is odd ) .",
    "if @xmath131 , then @xmath11 intersects a half image subgroup in an index 2 subgroup and the quotient of @xmath19 by that intersection is dihedral , so in this case , @xmath11 lies in the same connected component of @xmath83 as the half image groups .",
    "proposition [ prop : full ] and lemma [ lem : halffull ] now imply that if @xmath286 , then @xmath16 is trivial if @xmath131 and has order 2 otherwise .",
    "suppose that @xmath53 .",
    "two full image groups of the form @xmath291 generate a proper subgroup of @xmath19 , since the subgroup they generate contains no non - central involutions of @xmath20 . on the other hand , @xmath11 together with any non - conjugate full image subgroup generates @xmath19 by the same argument as above , and the intersection of two such groups has index greater than 2 , using the fact that @xmath49 is odd .",
    "the claim of the proposition follows .",
