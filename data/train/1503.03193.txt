    "the launch of the _ swift _ satellite in 2004 @xcite allowed systematic observations of the multi - wavelength grb afterglow at early epochs .",
    "these data , especially the early x - ray afterglow data , presented surprises to modelers .",
    "the overall x - ray lightcurves include five distinct temporal components @xcite : i : an early time steep decay phase connected to the prompt emission @xcite ; ii : a shallow decay ( or plateau ) phase , which may signify continuous energy injection of energy into the blastwave @xcite ; iii : a normal decay phase consistent with the forward shock emission of a constant - energy fireball ;",

    "the components i and v are are believed to be of an internal origin ( in contrast to the external shock origin ) . the other three components ( ii , iii and iv ) may be interpreted within the framework of the external shock models .",
    "the optical afterglow light curves also show interesting temporal behaviors @xcite . in the similar spirit as @xcite",
    ", @xcite attempted to summarize a `` synthetic '' light curveof optical emission .",
    "they found more components with distinct physical origins : ia : prompt optical flares ; ib : an early optical flare of an external reverse shock origin ; ii : an early shallow - decay segment ; iii : the standard afterglow component ( the normal decay component , sometimes with an early onset hump ) ; iv : the post - jet - break phase ; v : late optical flares ; vi : late rebrightening humps ; and vii : late supernova ( sn ) bumps .",
    "the components ii , iii and iv can find their counterparts in the canonical x - ray light curve ( components ii , iii , and iv in @xcite ) . some flares in the optical band have counterparts in x - rays , but some others do not @xcite . some components",
    "( e.g. , the reverse shock component ib and the supernova component vii ) are unique for the optical band only .",
    "there are two types of temporal breaks in the external shock models .",
    "one type corresponds to the crossing of a characteristc frequency in the observational band @xcite .",
    "such spectrally - related breaks occur at different epochs in different energy bands , and therefore are _",
    "a testable feature of such a break is that the spectral indices before and after the temporal break should be distinctly different .",
    "the second type of breaks are related to the hydrodynamic or geometric properties of the system .",
    "since both effects affect the global behavior of the blastwave , these breaks should be _ achromatic _",
    ", i.e. the temporal breaks in different energy bands should occur around the same observational time .",
    "most observed breaks in the grb lightcurves are likely of a hydrodynamic or geometric origin .",
    "observationally , essentially all the temporal breaks observed in the x - ray lightcurves are consistent with having no spectral changes across the break times @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the spectral breaks , especially the cooling break , are predicted to be very smooth , and are barely observable from the data ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", one expects that the temporal breaks seen by _ swift _ should be strictly achromatic based on the external forward shock models .",
    "broad - band afterglow data of grbs are rapidly accumulating .",
    "shortly after _ swift _ detected early x - ray afterglow lightcurves of grbs , some authors noticed that the basic requirement of achromaticity of grb afterglows is violated at least in some grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , while a significant break is seen in the x - ray lightcurves of some grbs , the optical lightcurve does not show evidence of a break at the corresponding time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . such a puzzling effect led theorists to suggest various non - forward - shock models of the x - ray afterglow : the long - lasting reverse shock model @xcite , the dust scattering model ( shao & dai 2007 ) , and the long - lasting central engine model @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "if most grb afterglows are chromatic , one must throw away the standard forward shock paradigm , and probably attribute other factors , in partular , the long - lasting central engine , to account for the x - ray afterglow .",
    "this would have profound implications for our understanding of the grb central engine and emission physics .",
    "yet , there seem to exist some grbs ( e.g. , the latest bright grb 130427a ) whose multi - wavelength data are consistent with the simplest forward shock afterglow model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore natural to ask the following question : in general how bad or how good are the external forward shock models in interpreting the grb afterglow data",
    "?    this paper aims at addressing this question through a systematic data analysis and theoretical modeling of a large sample of multi - wavelength afterglows . we study a sample of 85 _",
    "swift _ grbs up to march 2014 , which all have high - quality x - ray and optical light curve data to allow us to study the compliance of the data to the external forward shock models .",
    "the sample selection and data analyses are described in  2 . the theoretical external forward shock model , in particular , the so - called _ closure relations _",
    "are presented in  3 . in  4 , we grade the afterglows based on how well they abide by the forward shock models , and categorize them into five grades and three samples .",
    "a statistical analysis of various observational and theoretical parameters for the gold sample is presented in  5 .",
    "our results are summarized in  6 with some discussion .",
    "we notice that @xcite recently carried out a similar analysis , with the focus on the consistency of the data with afterglow models in individual temporal segments of x - ray and optical lightcurves , without analyzing the global achromatic / chromatic behaviors of the afterglows .    throughout the paper ,",
    "the subscripts `` o '' and `` x '' denote the optical and x - ray band , respectively , and the subsripts `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' denote the pre- and post - break segments , respectively . in addition , two spectral regimes are defined : `` i '' for @xmath9 , and `` ii '' for @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the minimum injection frequency and cooling frequency for synchrotron radiation , respectively .",
    "we systematically investigate all the _ swift _ grbs that have x - ray and optical afterglow data , over a span of almost 10 years from the launch of _ swift _ to march 2014 .",
    "a sample of @xmath13260 optical light curves are compiled from published papers or gcn circulars , and a sample of @xmath13900 x - ray light curves are obtained from the _ swift _ xrt data archive .",
    "well - sampled light curves in both x - ray and optical bands are available for 99 grbs .",
    "fifteen grbs do not have well constrained spectral indices either in optical or in x - ray bands to allow us to perform some theoretical constraints ( see details below ) .",
    "fourteen of them are removed from the sample .",
    "grb 070420 is the only grb without adequate spectral information that is included in our sample .",
    "this is because it has a clear chromatic feature , which allows us to group it into the bad sample even if the spectral information is not available ( see details in  [ sec : graderesutl ] ) .",
    "the remaining 84 grbs are included in our final sample , whose information is presented in table [ table : sample ] . for the optical data , the correction due to galactic extinction",
    "is taken into account using the reddening map presented by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . due to large uncertainties",
    ", we do not make corrections to the extinction in the grb host galaxies .    in order to quantify the rich temporal features of grb lightcurves",
    ", we fit the lightcurves with a model of multiple components .",
    "the basic component of our model is either a single power - law ( spl ) function @xmath14 or a smooth broken power - law ( bpl ) function @xmath15^{-1/\\omega } , \\label{f2}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the temporal slopes , @xmath18 is the break time , and @xmath19 measures the sharpness of the break . in some afterglow models , a double broken power - law light curve is expected .",
    "for example , it is theoretically expected that the afterglow light curve may have a shallow segment early on due to energy injection , then transits to a normal decay segment when energy injection is over , and finally steepens due to a jet break ( e.g. , in the canonical x - ray afterglow lightcurve , zhang et al .",
    "we therefore also consider a smooth triple - power - law ( tpl ) function to fit some lightcurves . in these cases , we extend equation ( [ f2 ] ) ( with @xmath2 defined as @xmath20 ) to the following function @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sharpness factor of the second break at @xmath23 , and @xmath24    we perform best fits to the data using a subroutine called mpfit .",
    "the sharpness parameter @xmath19 is usually adopted as 3 or 1 in our fitting . the parameter @xmath25 is not significantly affected by the choice of @xmath19 , but the pre- and post - break slopes ( i.e. @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) somewhat depend on the value of @xmath19 @xcite . the larger the value of @xmath19 , the sharper the break .",
    "the breaks in most x - ray and optical light curves at later times ( e.g. the energy injection breaks and the jet breaks ) can be well fit with @xmath28 , which is consistent with the fitting results using other empirical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "some very smooth breaks ( e.g. , the onset breaks in the early optical lightcurve curves ) require @xmath19 being around 1 @xcite , and we adopt this value when it is needed .",
    "one focus of our analysis is to study the `` chromaticity '' of the lightcurves in the x - ray and optical bands . in principle",
    "there are two approaches to do this .",
    "the first approach is to blindly search for @xmath2 using the best fits to the optical and x - ray data , respectively , and compare how different the two @xmath2 values are .",
    "such an approach usually gives different break times in the two bands @xcite .",
    "the second approach is to start with the achromatic assumption and investigate how bad the data violate such an assumption . by doing so",
    ", we reduce one free parameter , and impose a same @xmath2 in both bands in the model .",
    "we believe that this second approach is more reasonable to address the question `` how _ bad _ the external forward shock models are '' , so we adopt the second approach with the assist of the first approach .",
    "the detailed procedure of our light curve fitting is as follows :    * for each grb , we first fit the optical and x - ray afterglow light curves separately , and get the respective fitting parameters , such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the @xmath19 values of each break ) . a minimum number of components ( spl , bpl , or tpl ) are introduced based on eye inspection of the global features in the lightcurve .",
    "if the reduced @xmath31 is much larger than 1 , we continue to add more components and re - do the fits , until the reduced @xmath31 becomes close to 1 ( usually less than 1.5 ) .",
    "the reduced @xmath31 values for some lightcurves are much smaller than 1 , indicating that some model parameters are poorly constrained . for these cases ,",
    "we fix some parameters and redo the fits until the reduced @xmath31 becomes close to 1 .",
    "some grbs have erratic fluctuations in the lightcurves with small error bars , so that the reduced @xmath31 is much larger than 1 . for these cases",
    ", we do not add additional components to fit the lightcurves , so that their @xmath31 values remain much larger than 1 .",
    "* next , we jointly fit both optical and x - ray lightcurves by introducing a same @xmath2 .",
    "we search for a possible achromatic break time in the range [ @xmath29 , @xmath30 ] .",
    "we still fit the optical and x - ray lightcures at a test break time @xmath25 separately in this step .",
    "the individual @xmath31 of the optical or x - ray band could not represent the goodness of the jointly fit .",
    "to evaluate the goodness of the fits for optical and x - ray lightcurves at @xmath25 , we introduce a weighted reduced @xmath33 , which is essentially the average reduced @xmath31 in both bands .",
    "taking grb 050922c as an example : a best join fit is achieved at @xmath34 ks , where the reduced @xmath35 values are 175/157 and @xmath36 for the optical and x - ray bands , respectively , so that @xmath33 can be expressed as 361/314 .",
    "for all the grbs , we search for the common @xmath2 with the best @xmath33 .",
    "we accept the fits with the @xmath37 , and regard it as not inconsistent with being achromatic around 3 is somewhat arbitrary , but the value is determined based on close inspection of the fitting results of individual bursts .",
    "our results indicate that most grb afterglow light curves are well fit with the bpl or spl light curves models , with a typical value @xmath38 . however , some grbs ( e.g. , grb 050730 , 060904b , 080319c , 100901a , 120326a ) show a relatively large @xmath33 , which are around or even slightly larger than 3 . inspecting their light curves ,",
    "the relatively large @xmath33 is caused by complicated features in the light curves ( such as small flares and fluctuations ) , especially in the optical band ( e.g. , grb 060904b ) .",
    "however , the pl and bpl fits in any case catch the general features of these light curves .",
    "since we are interested in the achromatic / chromatic properties rather than the flaring features of the light curves , a relatively loose criterion ( @xmath39 ) is reasonable . ] .",
    "usually the parameters of this best join fits does not correspond to the best reduced @xmath31 in each band . *",
    "if both the optical and x - ray lightcurves decay as a spl , we do not need to search for a common break time .",
    "the weighted reduced @xmath33 is calculated based on the above algorithm for the spl fits in each band . *",
    "if one band decays as a bpl , while the other band does not have enough data to search for a break time and decays as a spl ( e.g. , the grade ii or iv in section 3 ) , we impose @xmath2 identified in the first band as the common @xmath2 , and perform the @xmath33 analysis as described above .",
    "the fitted results are presented in figure [ gradei]-[gradev ] .",
    "the parameters of the pl or bpl fits of all the lightcurves are presented in table [ table : sample ] .",
    "some lightcurves have additional features ( e.g. , steep decay phase , flares , rebrightening features ) in one band .",
    "we do not report them in table [ table : sample ] .",
    "our analysis below discards these extra components since they likely arise from additional emission components ( e.g. , in the internal dissipation regions such as internal shocks and internal magnetic dissipation sites ) other than the external shock .",
    "the standard external shock models of grb afterglows have clear theoretical predictions that can be verified or falsified by the observational data .",
    "these models attribute the multi - wavelength afterglow emission to synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated in the shock front as the fireball jet interacts with the circumburst medium . the models largely do not depend on the details of the central engine activities , so that the afterglow behaviors only depend on a limited number of parameters . in the convention of @xmath40 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are",
    "the temporal and spectral indices of the afterglows that can be measured directly from observations , the models predict certain relationships between @xmath0 and @xmath1 values , which are called the `` closure relations '' of the models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "technically there are many sub - models ( e.g. , ism vs. wind , adiabatic vs. radiative , whether or not there is energy injection ) , physical regimes ( reverse shock crossing phase , self - similar phase , post - jet - break phase , newtonian phase ) , and spectral regimes ( different orders among the observed frequency ( @xmath41 ) and several characteristic frequencies ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , the self - absorption frequency @xmath42 ) .",
    "we refer to a comprehensive review of @xcite and references therein for the details of various models .    for the time frame of our interest ( hours to weeks after the trigger ) , the reverse shock crossing phase is usually over , and the blastwave is still in the relativistic phase .",

    "the energy injection model invokes either a long - lasting central engine @xcite , or a lorentz - factor - stratified ejecta @xcite .",
    "the two scenarios are equivalent with each other in terms of lightcurve behaviors given a relationship between the central engine parameter @xmath3 and the stratification parameter @xmath45 ( zhang et al .",
    "we adopt the description of a long - lasting central engine with a power - law luminosity history @xmath51 ( zhang & mszros 2001 ) , so that the injected energy is @xmath52 .",

    "assuming a conical jet with opening angle @xmath5 , a steepening in the afterglow light curve is predicted when @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is the bulk lorentz factor of the blastwave ) .",
    "the main reason of this steepening is the so - called `` edge effect '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the @xmath56 cone is no longer filled with emission beyond the jet break time ( when @xmath57 ) .",
    "there is a reduction factor in flux @xmath58 .",
    "the relevant closure relations are also presented in table [ tab : alpha - beta ] .",

    "there are four types of lightcurves ( fig.[fit ] ) :    \\(1 ) broken power - law lightcurves with an energy injection break : in reference of the canonical x - ray light curve ( zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) , as reproduced in fig.[fit](a ) , the energy injection break connects the shallow decay phase ( segment ii ) to the normal decay phase ( segment iii ) , and a typical light curve is shown in figure [ fit](b ) . before and after the break , the adiabatic deceleration @xmath59 relations with and without energy injection ( as listed in table [ tab : alpha - beta ] , @xcite ) are used to check whether the data are consistent with model predictions .",
    "\\(2 ) broken power - law lightcurves with a jet break : this corresponds to transition from segment iii to iv in the canonical lightcurve , and a typical light curve is shown in figure [ fit](c ) upper curve .",
    "lightcurves of such a category should satisfy the constant - energy , isotropic closure relations before the break , and the edge - effect post - jet - break closure relations after the break , with no energy injection effect both before and after the break ( table [ tab : alpha - beta ] ) . the post - break decay index is required to be steeper than 1.5 for this model .",
    "\\(3 ) broken power - law lightcurves with a jet break with energy injection : this model allows the energy injection extend to a duration longer than the jet break .",
    "the temporal break is still defined by the edge effect of a canonical jet , but the decay slopes before and after the break are shallower than the previous case ( lower curve in fig.[fit](c ) ) , so that a @xmath3 parameter is introduced for both pre- and post - break phases .",

    "we ignore the steep decay phase and treat it as a spl decay ( upper curve of fig.[fit](d ) ) .",
    "similarly , in the optical band , some grbs show an early rising phase , which is a signature of the onset of afterglow at the deceleration radius ( peak of the lightcurve , lower curve of fig.[fit](d ) ) .",
    "we treat these lightcurves also as spl decay ones .    for all the types , sometimes there are x - ray flares overlapping on the power - law decay segments .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one important task is to perform a self - consistency check between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "if a grb is consistent with the external forward shock model , we demand that the grb satisfies the following criteria :    * the x - ray and optical lightcurves are consistent with having an achromatic break if any ; * both the x - ray and optical lightcurves should satisfy closure relations of a same circumburst medium type ( ism or wind ) in both pre- and post - break temporal segments ; * either both bands belong to the same spectral regime , or the two bands are separated by a cooling break @xmath12 , with the x - ray band above the break and the optical band below the break ( with allowance of a grey zone , see more discussion below ) ; * the inferred electron spectral index @xmath4 from both bands and from both pre- and post - break segments should be consistent with each other within error ; * for energy injection models , the energy injection parameter @xmath3 values derived from the x - ray and optical bands should be consistent with each other .",

    "the results of this study can be summarized as the following .",
    "based on how well the data abide by the external forward shock afterglow models , we categorized grbs into five grades and three samples :    * a gold sample ( grade i and ii ) includes 45/85 grbs",
    ". these grbs are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions of the external shock models , including having an acceptable achromatic break and fulfilling various closure relations between the temporal decay indices @xmath0 and spectral indices @xmath1 . * a silver sample ( grade iii and iv ) includes 37/85 grbs .",
    "these grbs are also consistent with having an acceptable achromatic break , even though one or more afterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations .",
    "these grbs are potentially interpretable within the framework of external shock models . *",
    "a bad sample ( grade v ) only includes 3/85 grbs .",
    "these grbs show direct evidence of chromatic behaviors , which can not be accounted for within single - component external shock models .",
    "the bottom line of this study is to address how bad / good the external shock models are .",
    "our results show that external shock models work very well for at least @xmath13 53% of grbs ( our gold sample ) .",
    "these grbs can be interpreted within the simplest afterglow models . if more advanced modeling invoking other factors ( e.g. , structured jet or long - lasting reverse shock ) is carried out , up to @xmath212 of grbs ( including the silver sample ) _ may be _ accounted for within the external shock models .",
    "only less than 4% grbs truly violate the basic expectations of the external shock models , and demand another emission component ( e.g. , central engine afterglow ) to account for emission in at least one band ( e.g. , the x - ray band ) .",
    "several caveats deserve mentioning .",
    "first , we only focused on the main afterglow components ( spl , bpl or tpl ) of the x - ray and optical lightcurves . in some grbs , there are additional components overlapping with these main components , such as the x - ray steep decay phase , x - ray flares , and optical re - brightening features , which are not included in the analysis .",
    "these features are usually chromatic , and demand additional emission components to interpret the data .",
    "the general conclusion that a lot of grbs have extended central engine activities @xcite remain valid . the true duration of the grb central engine activities may be much longer than what is measured by the grb duration @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "second , we adopted a relatively `` loose '' criterion ( @xmath214 ) to define `` achromaticity '' by requiring the x - ray and optical lightcurves to have a same break time .",
    "searching for break times independently in the two bands often results in somewhat different break times , but many grbs can be made being consistent with achromatic .",
    "the relatively large @xmath39 in some grbs is mostly caused by the additional features ( small flares and fluctuations which we do not care ) in the otherwise ( broken ) power law lightcurves .",
    "we therefore believe that our approach is appropriate to address the question of `` how bad the models are '' . on the other hand ,",
    "if in the future high - quality data indeed show slight chromatic behaviors with high confidence , one should take cautious to the fraction numbers presented in this paper , and consider how such slight chromatic behaviors may impact the models .",
    "finally , we only studied 85 grbs that have both bright x - ray and bright optical emission data to allow us to perform the test .",
    "there are more grbs detected by _ swift _",
    "( @xmath215 with x - ray lightcurves and @xmath216 with optical lightcurves ) . due to the complicated sample selection effects",

    "<S> multi - wavelength observations in the _ swift _ era have revealed chromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some grbs , casting doubts on the external forward shock origin of grb afterglows . in this paper , using a large sample of grbs with both x - ray and optical afterglow data , we perform a systematic study to address the question : how bad / good are the external forward shock models ? </S>",
    "<S> our sample includes 85 grbs up to march 2014 with well - monitored x - ray and optical lightcurves . </S>",
    "<S> based on how well the data abide by the external forward shock models , we categorize them into five grades and three samples . </S>",
    "<S> the first two grades ( grade i and ii ) include 45/85 grbs . they show </S>",
    "<S> evidence of , or are consistent with having , an achromatic break . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal / spectral behaviors in each afterglow segment are consistent with the predictions ( the `` closure relations '' ) of the forward shock models . </S>",

    "<S> these grbs are included in the silver sample . </S>",
    "<S> finally , grade v ( 3/85 ) shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors , suggesting that the external shock models are inconsistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> these are included in the bad sample . </S>",
    "<S> we further perform statistical analyses of various observational properties ( temporal index @xmath0 , spectral index @xmath1 , break time @xmath2 ) and model parameters ( energy injection index @xmath3 , electron spectral index @xmath4 , jet opening angle @xmath5 , radiative efficiency @xmath6 , etc ) of the grbs in the gold sample , and derive constraints on the magnetization parameter @xmath7 in the forward shock . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we conclude that the simplest external forward shock models can account for the multi - wavelength afterglow data of at least half of the grbs . when more advanced modeling ( e.g. , long - lasting reverse shock , structured jets , arbitrary circumburst medium density profile ) is invoked , up to @xmath8 of the afterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the external shock models . </S>"
