    "the problem of compactifying the generalized jacobian of a singular curve has been studied since igusa s work @xcite around 1950 .",
    "he constructed a compactification of the jacobian of a nodal and irreducible curve @xmath0 as the limit of the jacobians of smooth curves approaching @xmath0 .",
    "igusa also showed that his compactification does not depend on the considered family of smooth curves .",
    "an intrinsic characterization of the boundary points of the igusa s compactification as the torsion free , rank 1 sheaves which are not line bundles is due to mumford and mayer .",
    "the complete construction for a family of integral curves over a noetherian hensel local ring with residue field separably closed was carried out by dsouza @xcite .",
    "one year later , altman and kleiman @xcite gave the construction for a general family of integral curves .    when the curve @xmath0 is reducible and nodal , oda and seshadri @xcite produced a family of compactified jacobians @xmath5 parameterized by an element @xmath6 of a real vector space .",
    "seshadri dealt in @xcite with the general case of a reduced curve considering sheaves of higher rank as well .    in 1994 , caporaso showed @xcite how to compactify the relative jacobian over the moduli of stable curves and described the boundary points of the compactified jacobian of a stable curve @xmath0 as invertible sheaves on certain deligne - mumford semistable curves that have @xmath0 as a stable model . recently",
    ", pandharipande @xcite has given another construction with the boundary points now representing torsion free , rank 1 sheaves and he showed that the caporaso s compactification was equivalent to his .",
    "on the other hand , esteves @xcite constructed a compactification of the relative jacobian of a family of geometrically reduced and connected curves and compared it with seshadri s construction @xcite using theta funtions and alexeev @xcite gave a description of the jacobian of certain singular curves in terms of the orientations on complete subgraphs of the dual graph of the curve .",
    "simpson s work @xcite on the moduli of pure coherent sheaves on projective spaces allows us to define in a natural way the jacobian of any projective curve @xmath0 as the space @xmath7 of equivalence classes of stable invertible sheaves with degree @xmath1 .",
    "this is precisely the definition we adopt and we also denote by @xmath8 the space of equivalence classes of semistable , pure dimension 1 , rank 1 sheaves with degree @xmath1 .    in some recent papers about the moduli spaces of stable vector bundles on elliptic fibrations , for instance @xcite , the jacobian in the sense of simpson of spectral curves appears .",
    "beauville @xcite uses it as well in counting the number of rational curves on k3 surfaces .",
    "this suggests the necessity to determine the structure of these simpson jacobians .    the aim of this work is to describe the simpson jacobian of a generalized tree - like curve , that is , a projective , reduced and connected curve such that the intersection points of its irreducible components are disconnecting ordinary double points .",

    "then , we write @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the degree of @xmath2 , @xmath17 is the degree of the induced polarization on @xmath12 and @xmath18 is the residue class of @xmath1 minus the arithmetic genus of @xmath0 modulo @xmath16 .",

    "finally , we prove that strictly semistable torsion free rank 1 sheaves exist only when @xmath31 for some @xmath15 and in this case we construct a jordan - hlder filtration for it to conclude that its @xmath32-equivalence class belongs to @xmath33 .",
    "it is important to note that , although @xmath34 for any integers @xmath1 and @xmath35 , because @xmath4 is an integral curve , to obtain a point in @xmath8 it is necessary to consider sheaves on @xmath4 of degrees exactly the integer numbers @xmath3    theorem [ t ] allows also to describe a wall - crossing structure for these simpson jacobians , in other words , to analyze the variation of the moduli spaces @xmath7 as the polarization changes .",
