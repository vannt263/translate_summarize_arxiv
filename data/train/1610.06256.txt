    "in high - energy nucleus - nucleus (  ) collisions elliptic flow , as the physical interpretation of an azimuth - quadrupole component of angular correlations denoted by symbol @xmath0 , has played a central role in supporting arguments claiming quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation  @xcite . according to the conventional flow narrative elliptic flow should be sensitive to the early stage of high - energy   collisions where quarks and gluons are believed to be the more - likely degrees of freedom .",
    "correlation data demonstrating the presence of elliptic flow might confirm large energy and matter densities and copious parton rescattering to achieve a thermalized qgp  @xcite .    the rhic experimental program has seemed to provide strong evidence confirming what may be termed a flow - qgp narrative based on data obtained with certain preferred measures and techniques .",
    "it was therefore concluded in 2005 that a `` strongly - coupled qgp '' or `` perfect liquid '' is formed in central  collisions at rhic energies  @xcite .",
    "however , one should distinguish between ( a ) the physical mechanism of elliptic flow and ( b ) the observed phenomenon of a cylindrical quadrupole on azimuth near midrapidity .",
    "the existence of ( a ) might imply ( b ) but observation of ( b ) does not _ require _ ( a ) , and other observations may falsify ( a ) .",
    "the present study applies novel analysis methods to recent lhc @xmath5 data for identified hadrons .",
    "some analysis results appear to contradict essential elements of the flow - qgp narrative .",
    "extensive studies of two - dimensional ( 2d ) angular correlations  @xcite have established that there are two main contributions to an observed azimuth quadrupole : ( a ) a nonjet ( nj ) quadrupole component and ( b ) a jet - related quadrupole contribution derived from a same - side ( on azimuth ) 2d jet peak representing _ intra_jet angular correlations . contribution ( b ) is often referred to as `` nonflow '' without acknowledging the dominant jet mechanism .",
    "the nj quadrupole can be isolated accurately from jet - related and other contributions by model fits to 2d angular correlations  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 data trends obtained with that method are inconsistent with an elliptic - flow interpretation in several ways  @xcite .",
    "jet - related bias of published @xmath0 data has been estimated for cases where the preferred analysis method is simply related to 2d angular correlations  @xcite",
    ". physical interpretation of the nj quadrupole remains a central issue : does it represent elliptic flow or some alternative mechanism  @xcite ?    although quadrupole @xmath0 data have played a central role in claims of qgp formation , hadron production near midrapidity appears to be dominated by two other mechanisms : ( a ) longitudinal projectile - nucleon dissociation ( soft ) and ( b ) transverse large - angle parton scattering and jet formation ( hard ) .",
    "the two mechanisms form the basis for the two - component ( soft + hard ) model ( tcm ) of hadron yields , spectra and correlations  @xcite .",
    "the tcm then provides an essential context for interpretation of nj quadrupole data .    to better understand the relation between the nj quadrupole and hydrodynamic ( hydro ) theory expectations for flows , @xmath5 data for three species of identified hadrons from 200 gev  collisions were transformed to obtain _ quadrupole spectra",
    "the three quadrupole spectra were found to be consistent with emission from a common boosted hadron source .",
    "the inferred narrow boost distribution suggested emission from an expanding thin cylindrical shell .",
    "the three spectra were found to be equivalent modulo rescaling by factors consistent with a statistical model of hadron abundances  @xcite .",
    "quadrupole - spectrum parameters were very different from those for single - particle ( sp ) spectra for most produced hadrons from the same collisions .",
    "the study concluded that the nj quadrupole may be independent of most hadrons and may represent a unique mechanism unrelated to a flowing dense medium or qgp .    in the present study several @xmath0 analysis methods and associated data trends for -integral data are compared , with emphasis on the extent to which jet - related correlations contribute to @xmath0 data from various methods .",
    "the quadrupole spectrum concept is introduced and methods are presented for obtaining quadrupole spectra by combining @xmath3 data and sp  spectra @xmath6 .",
    "quadrupole spectra from the cited analysis of 200 gev  data are reviewed to illustrate the method .",
    "recent @xmath5 data for four hadron species from seven centrality classes of 2.76 tev  collisions are then analyzed similarly to obtain corresponding quadrupole spectra .",
    "the main goal of the present study is determination of the collision - energy and   centrality dependence of nj quadrupole spectra so as to further test the relation ( if any ) between the nj quadrupole and hydro mechanisms , and possibly to elucidate alternative ( qcd ) mechanisms .",

    "the flow narrative is based on certain _ a priori _ assumptions , preferred analysis methods , physical interpretations and hydro theory that have evolved over time with increasing collision energies at a succession of accelerators .",
    "the conjectured phenomena include `` jet quenching '' ( modification or absorption of jets in the dense medium or qgp ) , various flows as manifested in spectra and correlations , and especially elliptic flow interpreted to provide the basis for claims of `` perfect liquid '' formed in high - energy   collisions  @xcite .",
    "the flow - qgp narrative provides one limiting case .",
    "the other limit is _ transparent _   collisions described as linear superpositions of elementary  collisions ( e.g.  collisions in isolation ) . to provide a context for the present study of nj quadrupole spectra",
    "the two limiting cases are summarized briefly .",
    "first demonstration of flowing _ nucleonic _ matter in relativistic   collisions  @xcite represented a major achievement of the bevalac program .",

    "it was concluded that a flow description is essential for nuclear collisions within that energy interval , that a thermodynamic state might be established and that a qcd phase transition might be relevant at higher energies .",
    "progressing approximately in parallel with the bevalac   program were fixed - target studies of  collisions within the cm energy interval @xmath10 - 30 gev ( 50 - 400 gev beam energy ) . whereas bevalac - ags   results below 5 gev were consistent with projectile stopping and nearly - opaque nuclei the  results",
    "were interpreted to indicate `` ... the apparent near transparency of nuclear matter to coherently produced multiparticle states ... ''  @xcite attributed to relativistic and quantum effects . in effect ,",
    "time dilation prevents interaction of virtual projectile - hadron _ fragments _ within the target - nucleus volume .",
    "most hadron fragments are formed only later outside the collision volume : `` the lack of significant nuclear cascading has led to the conclusion that the high energy secondaries [ `` shower '' particles with @xmath11 , mainly pions ] produced in the fundamental hadron - nucleon collision take a long time to form compared to nuclear [ target nucleus a ] dimensions ''  @xcite .",
    "`` the limited space - time development of hadronic matter inside a hit nucleus is a probable explanation of the low pion multiplicities in [ ] reactions .... the [ shower ] pions do not transfer any significant energy to the target nucleus ''  @xcite . `` ...",

    "according to lattice qcd such densities should provide conditions required for a deconfinement phase transition to a qgp .",
    "a cross section of 1 - 2 mb with mean free paths less than 1 fm would imply copious rescattering , thermalization and flows responding to large density gradients .    a key element in the conflict between  transparency and the claimed   qgp is interpretation of the nj quadrupole component of azimuth correlations .",
    "if the nj quadrupole is indeed a flow manifestation the flow - qgp narrative is supported , but if the quadrupole component is demonstrated to be a novel _ nonflow _ qcd phenomenon the conjectured flowing dense medium or qgp is unlikely . in the present study @xmath24 ( -integral ) and @xmath5 ( -differential ) data as inferred from several sources are reconsidered in the context of jets and flows .",
    "contributions to @xmath0 data from jets are identified and removed , and the remaining nj @xmath0 component is compared with hydro expectations to challenge the claim that @xmath0 data represent a flow phenomenon .",

    "<S> according to the flow narrative commonly applied to high - energy nuclear collisions a 1d cylindrical - quadrupole component of 2d angular correlations conventionally denoted by quantity @xmath0 is interpreted to represent elliptic flow : azimuth modulation of transverse or radial flow in noncentral nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions . </S>",
    "<S> jet angular correlations may also contribute to @xmath0 data as `` nonflow '' depending on the method used to calculate @xmath0 , but 2d graphical methods can achieve accurate separation . </S>",
    "<S> the nonjet ( nj ) quadrupole component exhibits various properties inconsistent with a flow or hydro interpretation , including the observation that nj - quadrupole centrality variation in @xmath1-@xmath1 collisions has no relation to strongly - varying jet modification ( `` jet quenching '' ) in those collisions commonly attributed to jet interaction with a dense flowing medium . in the present study i report isolation of quadrupole spectra from @xmath2-differential @xmath3 data obtained at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhcr ) . </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate that nj quadrupole spectra have characteristics very different from the single - particle spectra for most hadrons , that quadrupole spectra indicate a common boosted hadron source for a small minority of hadrons that `` carry '' the quadrupole structure , that the narrow source - boost distribution is characteristic of an expanding thin cylindrical shell ( also strongly contradicting a hydro interpretation ) , and that in the boost frame a single universal quadrupole spectrum ( lvy distribution ) on transverse mass @xmath4 accurately describes data for several hadron species scaled according to their statistical - model abundances . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole spectrum shape changes very little from rhic to lhc energies . taken in combination those characteristics strongly suggest a unique _ nonflow _ ( and nonjet ) qcd mechanism for the nj quadrupole conventionally represented by @xmath0 . </S>"
