    "these equations give the asymptotic description of the degenerate painlev functions beyond the sectors in ( [ y4n ] ) and ( [ y4n-2 ] ) . observing that the difference ( [ yk_hat_yk ] ) is exponentially small in the interior of the indicated sector ,",
    "we conclude that the asymptotics ( [ y4n ] ) and ( [ y4n-2 ] ) as @xmath3 continue to wider open sectors , @xmath300 where @xmath251 is an arbitrary small constant .    [ rem3 ] the solutions @xmath301 ( [ yk_def ] ) corresponding to the trivial values of two stokes multipliers @xmath302 are the most degenerate among the painlev transcendent since they behave algebraically in four of five sectors @xmath303 , @xmath304 , see ( [ y4n_ext ] ) , ( [ y4n-2_ext ] ) .",

    "[ rem4 ] the asymptotics of less degenerate solutions corresponding to @xmath305 and @xmath306 can be found applying the symmetries ( [ p_symmetries_rotate ] ) to equations ( [ y+_as ] ) and ( [ y-_as ] ) .",
