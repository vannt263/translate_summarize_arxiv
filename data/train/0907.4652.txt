    "the understanding of the _ kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group _ ( the multiplicities appearing when the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group is decomposed into irreducibles ; equivalently , the structural constants for the kronecker product of symmetric functions in the schur basis ) is a longstanding open problem .",

    "the starting point of the investigation presented in this paper is a remarkable stability property for the kronecker products of schur functions discovered by murnaghan @xcite .",
    "this property is best shown on an example , that will be followed by a precise statement . denote the kronecker product of @xmath3 and @xmath4 by @xmath5 .",

    "we also give an expression of the reduced kronecker coefficients in terms of littlewood - richardson coefficients and kronecker coefficients .",
    "the main significance of this expression is that it does nt involve cancellations and it provides us with a tool to prove most of our main results . in section [ sec : product ]",
