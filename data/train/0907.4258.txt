    "a pom is a decomposition of the identity into @xmath4 probability operators @xmath5 , which we call _ outcomes _ , @xmath6 the probabilities @xmath7 permit a reconstruction of the statistical operator @xmath8 , the _ state _ of the physical system , if the pom is informationally complete ( ic ) . in a @xmath3-dimensional hilbert space , an ic  pom must have at least @xmath2 outcomes , and a minimal ic  pom has exactly @xmath9 outcomes and no redundant ones , and then the state @xmath8 is uniquely expressed in terms of the probabilities @xmath10 and the _ reconstruction operators _ @xmath11 that are dual to the outcomes @xmath5 , @xmath12    a sic  pom is a minimal ic  pom with the symmetry property that all outcomes are unitarily equivalent with `` equal angles '' between each pair of outcomes , @xmath13 the reconstruction operators for such a sic  pom are @xmath14 so that @xmath15 these translate @xmath16 into @xmath17 a second constraint obeyed by the probabilities @xmath10 in addition to the unit sum in ( [ eq : probs ] ) . the equal sign in ( [ eq : purity ] ) applies when @xmath8 is a pure state , @xmath18 , and only then .",

    "owing to the statistical fluctuations that originate in the quantum indeterminism , the relative frequencies of detector counts are not equal to the probabilities @xmath66 and @xmath67 , at best the respective relative frequencies @xmath68 and @xmath69 approximate the intrinsic probabilities .    therefore , there is danger in relying on ( [ eq : reconstruct ] ) .",
    "the reconstructed states @xmath70 are not guaranteed to be positive operators .",
    "it is possible , and indeed happens regularly when the true state has high purity , that these _ raw data _ ( rd )",

    "a thorough coverage of many aspects of quantum state estimation is given in the 2004 monograph of paris and ehek  @xcite .",
    "the probability that a total of @xmath71 detector clicks is recorded with the actual relative frequencies @xmath72 is the _ likelihood _ @xmath73 .",

    "accordingly , we need to calculate the ml estimate only if the rd reconstruction ( [ eq : rho - estim ] ) fails .",
    "the ml estimate is found by a numerical iteration that begins with an arbitrary guess @xmath77 , for which the completely mixed state @xmath78 is an option , and then determines improved estimates successively in accordance with the update rule @xmath79\\rho_{\\mathrm{est}}^{(k ) }         \\bigl[1+\\epsilon_kr_k\\bigr ] } { { \\mathrm{tr}{\\left\\{\\bigl[1+\\epsilon_kr_k\\bigr]\\rho_{\\mathrm{est}}^{(k ) }         \\bigl[1+\\epsilon_kr_k\\bigr]\\right\\}}}}\\,,\\ ] ] where ( replace @xmath44 by @xmath80 for the product pom ) @xmath81 and @xmath82 is a suitably chosen increment ( see below ) .",
    "the iteration stops when the trace class distance @xmath83 is below the pre - set accuracy threshold .",
