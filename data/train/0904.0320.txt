    "thermal excitations in superfluid baryon matter of neutron stars , in the form of broken cooper pairs , can recombine into the condensate by emitting neutrino pairs via neutral weak currents .",
    "this process was suggested @xcite many years ago as an efficient mechanism for cooling of neutron stars in some ranges of temperature and/or matter density .",
    "the interest in this process has been recently revived @xcite@xcite in connection with the fact that the existing theory of thermal neutrino radiation from superfluid neutron matter leads to a rapid cooling of the neutron star crust , which is in dramatic discrepancy with the observed data of superbursts @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was realized that a better understanding of an efficiency of the neutrino emission in the pair recombination is necessary to explain modern observations .",
    "the relevant input for calculation of neutrino energy losses from the medium is the imaginary part of the retarded weak - polarization tensor intimately connected with the autocorrelation function of weak currents in the medium .",
    "though the theoretical investigation of the autocorrelation functions of strong - interacting superfluid fermions was started more than four decades ago the complete theory of the problem does not yet exist .",
    "leggett s theory of a superfluid fermi liquid @xcite is limited to the case when both the transferred energy and momentum are small compared to the superfluid energy gap , i.e. , @xmath0 .",
    "this theory can not be applied to calculations of neutrino energy losses because , in this case , we need the medium response onto an external neutrino field in the time - like kinematic domain , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , as required by the total energy @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4 of escaping neutrino pair .    the well - known larkin - migdal theory @xcite is restricted to the case of zero temperature .",
    "recently , the calculation of the neutrino energy losses was undertaken in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , where the imaginary part of the autocorrelation functions was calculated for a superfluid neutron matter at zero temperature .",
    "this approach is apparently inconsistent because the imaginary part of retarded polarization functions substantially depends on the temperature [ see eqs .",
    "( [ l ] ) , ( [ t ] ) , ( [ imk00 ] ) , and ( [ imkij ] ) of this work ] . one more inconsistency of the work @xcite is , that the temporal component of the axial - vector current can not be discarded , as it is done by the authors .",
    "this relativistic correction contributes to the neutrino energy losses of the same order as the spin - density fluctuations , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "this was pointed out for the first time in ref .",

    "@xcite , where the mean - field bcs approximation is used to calculate the superfluid response in the vector channel . to include the fermi - liquid effects discarded in the bcs approximation , in this paper , we first generalize leggett s theory to the case of arbitrary momentum transfer .",
    "we evaluate the weak - interaction effective vertices and the autocorrelation functions while taking into account strong residual particle - hole interactions . to obtain a solution of leggett s equations in reasonably simple form , we approximate the particle - hole interactions by its first two harmonics with the aid of the usual landau parameters . within these constraints",
    "we obtain the general expression for the autocorrelation functions and then focus on the superfluid response in the time - like kinematic domain .",
    "we investigate both the vector channel and the axial channel of weak interactions to evaluate the rate of neutrino energy loss through neutral weak currents caused by recombination of electrically neutral baryons .",
    "the role of electromagnetic correlations in the pairing case of charged baryons interacting with the electron background deserves a separate consideration .",
    "the quantum transitions of charged quasiparticles can excite background electrons , thus inducing the neutrino - pair emission by the electron plasma @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in summary , we briefly discuss this problem in the light of modern theory to understand whether the plasma effects can lead to noticeable neutrino energy losses through the vector channel .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii , we discuss the set of equations derived by leggett for calculation of correlation functions of a superfluid fermi liquid at finite temperature . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the superfluid response in the vector channel . because of the conservation of the vector weak current it is sufficient to consider only the longitudinal and transverse autocorrelation functions .",

    ", we found that the spherical harmonic of the particle - hole interaction does not affect the imaginary parts of polarization functions in the time - like domain .",
    "the imaginary part of both the longitudinal and transverse polarization functions are proportional to @xmath192 , and thus the particle - hole interactions are not able to increase substantially the intensity of neutrino - pair emission through the vector channel .    the imaginary part of the axial polarization is suppressed as @xmath257 , therefore the dominating neutrino emission occurs in the axial channel .",

    "though the direct neutrino interaction with recombining protons is screened by the proton background @xcite , the proton quantum transitions can excite background electrons , thus inducing the neutrino - pair emission by the electron plasma .",
    "this effect has been already studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; therefore , we only briefly revisit this problem in the light of modern theory to understand whether the plasma effects can lead to noticeable neutrino energy losses through the vector channel . for the sake of simplicity we consider a degenerate plasma consisting of nonrelativistic superfluid protons and relativistic electrons . as found in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , the role of the electron background , in this case , consists of the effective renormalization of the proton vector weak coupling constant , @xmath289 .",
    "thus we find that the electron background strongly increases the effective proton vector weak coupling with the neutrino field , @xmath290 however , this huge factor should not mislead the reader , because it arises only as a result of a very small proton coupling constant , @xmath291 . since the degenerate electron plasma can be considered in the collisionless approximation ,",
    "the imaginary part of the medium polarization arises from the proton pair recombination and therefore is proportional to @xmath192 , where @xmath292 is the fermi velocity of protons .",
    "thus the neutrino emission through the vector channel is suppressed by a small factor @xmath192 and may be ignored in comparison with the dominating neutrino radiation in the axial channel , where the neutrino energy losses are suppressed as @xmath257 .",

    "( [ ea ] ) .",
    "the magnitudes of the landau parameters @xmath278 are poorly known and depend on the baryon density . by modern estimates",
    "@xcite , @xcite , these could be of the order of unity .",
    "thus the fermi - liquid effects can notably modify the emissivity dependence on the temperature and the matter density as compared to that found in the bcs approximation .",
    "this , however , can not change the main conclusion that the dominating contribution to the neutron and proton emissivity comes from the axial channel of weak interactions @xcite .",
    "this means that the neutrino energy losses are to be suppressed as compared to that of ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor of @xmath293 .",
