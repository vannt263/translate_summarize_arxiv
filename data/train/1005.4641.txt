    "computer networks consist of nodes ( routers and switches ) connected by physical links ( optical or copper wires ) .",
    "data from one node ( called a _ source _ ) to another ( _ destination _ ) is sent over the network on predetermined paths , or routes .",
    "we will call the stream of data between a particular source / destination pair a _",
    "flow_. the so  called _ flow  level traffic _ may traverse only a single link , if the source and destination nodes are directly connected , or several links , if they are not .",
    "also of interest is the aggregate data traversing each _ link_. the traffic on a given link is the sum of the traffic of the various flows using the link .    both the _ flow  level _ and _ link  level _ traffic have been studied in the literature .",
    "flow level data is expensive to obtain and process , but provides information directly about the flows .",
    "data , especially that involving packet delays from source to destination , has been used to do something .",
    "see some references . on the other hand ,",
    "the link level data is less expensive to obtain , but provides less information about the underlying flows .",
    "these data have been studied extensively by the field of network tomography .",
    "this work examines the problem of predicting the traffic level on an unobserved link via measurements on a subset of the other links in the network . rather than focusing solely on the inexpensive link level data , we also employ flow  level measurements to inform a model that can then be utilized to make solve the prediction problem .",
    "we demonstrate that this model , although initially requiring the expensive flow  level data , may be used with a large range of link level data from the same network .",
    "thus , this work is the first to combine both flow and link level data in an efficient and feasible way .",
    "the remainder of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the computer network framework and the link  level prediction problem in detail .",
    "section 3 describes the proposed model that utilizes the flow  level traffic .",
    "section 4 demonstrates the robustness of the resulting model , while section 5 illustrates a potential application of the methodologies described herein in the case when all links may be observed .",
    "here , we introduce some notation and motivate our modeling framework in the context of network prediction .",
    "computer networks consist of collections of nodes ( routers and switches ) connected by physical links ( optical or copper wires ) .",
    "the networks may be viewed as connected directed or undirected graphs .",
    "figure [ fig : scen7 ] illustrates , for example , the topology of the internet2 backbone network @xcite , comprised of 9 nodes ( routers ) and 26 unidirectional links .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number of nodes , links , and routes , respectively , of a given network .",
    "typically , every node can serve both as a source and a destination of traffic and thus there are @xmath3 different routes corresponding to all ordered @xmath4 pairs .",
    "computer traffic from one node to another is routed over predetermined sets of links called paths or routes .",
    "these paths are best described in terms of the routing matrix @xmath5 , where @xmath6 the rows of the matrix @xmath7 correspond to the @xmath1 links and the columns to the @xmath2 routes . in the internet2 network , for example , the route @xmath8 from chicago to kansas city involves only one link , and thus the @xmath8th column of @xmath7 has a single @xmath9 on corresponding to the link connecting the two nodes ; similarly , the @xmath10hop routes correspond to columns of @xmath7 with precisely @xmath10 @xmath9 s .",
    "we are interested in the statistical modeling of the traffic on the _ entire _ network .",
    "let @xmath11 be the vector of the traffic _ flows _ at time @xmath12 on all @xmath2 routes , i.e.  between all source  destination pairs .",
    "that is , @xmath13 is the number of bytes transmitted over route @xmath8 during the time interval @xmath14 $ ] , for some fixed @xmath15 .",
    "depending on the context , the time units ( @xmath16 ) can range from a few milliseconds up to several seconds or even minutes .",
    "similarly , let @xmath17 be the vector of the traffic loads at time @xmath12 over all @xmath1 links .",
    "figures [ fig : flows ] and [ fig : baok ] illustrate _",
    "flow _ and _ link  level _ traffic over the internet2 network .    assuming that traffic propagates instantaneously through the network , the load @xmath18 on link @xmath19 at time @xmath12 equals the cumulative traffic of all routes using this link : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the set of routes that involve link @xmath19 . in matrix notation , we obtain @xmath22 we shall refer to as to the _ routing equation_. in practice ,",
    "this relationship between the _ flow  level _ traffic @xmath23 and the _ link  level _ traffic @xmath24 is essentially exact , provided that the time scale of measurement @xmath16 is comparable or greater than the maximum _ round trip time _ ( rtt ) for packets in the network . in this paper",
    ", we consider aggregate data over 10 second intervals , a time substantially greater the the rtt of a packet over the internet2 backbone .",
    "the statistical behavior of the network traffic traces over _ individual _ links or flows has been studied extensively in the past 20 years .",
    "an important _ burstiness _ phenomenon was observed , which rendered the classical telephone traffic models based on poisson and markov processes inapplicable .",
    "mechanistic and physically interpretable models were developed that explain and relate the observed burstiness to the notions of long  range dependence and self  similarity . for more details , see eg @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein .    under general conditions , limit theorems show that the cumulative fluctuations of the traffic about its mean can be naturally modeled with _",
    "fractional brownian motions _",
    "the fbm s are zero mean gaussian processes , which have stationary increments and are _ self ",
    "similar_. for more details , see @xcite or section [ s : adet ] below .",
    "other limit regimes are also possible , which lead to stable infinite variance models .",
    "these models , however , are less robust to network configurations than the fractional brownian motion and are encountered less frequently in practice ( see eg @xcite ) .    here , our focus is not on the temporal dependence of traffic , which has been studied extensively .",
    "rather , our goal is to model the global structural relationship between all links on the network at a fixed instant of time , @xmath25 .",
    "motivated by existing single ",
    "flow models , we shall suppose that the vector @xmath26 representing the traffic on all flows of the network is multivariate normal : @xmath27 as discussed in @xcite , the link  level , as well as flow  level traffic can be well  modeled by using multivariate long  range dependent gaussian processes .",
    "the routing equation yields : @xmath28    a first natural application and in fact our motivation to develop global network traffic models comes from the _ network prediction _ problem . the performance of our models will be explored and illustrated in this context .          in view of the gaussianity of our global traffic model ,",
    "we focus on linear predictors . in the next section ,",
    "we start by adapting the classical _ ordinary kriging _",
    "methodology from geostatistics to the networking context .",
    "this is perhaps the best that one can do given no prior statistical information about the network other than its topology and routing .",
    "even in such a limited setting it turns out that one can sometimes obtain useful predictors .    in many @xmath37scenarios , however , _",
    "ordinary network kriging _ does not provide helpful results .",
    "the main problem is the lack of information about the traffic means ( and to a lesser degree covariances ) on the unobserved links .",
    "this issue can only be resolved by incorporating additional , network ",
    "specific information about the traffic .",
    "we do so , in section [ sec : network - model ] , where by exploring ( off  line ) large netflow data sets , we recover estimates of all flows @xmath38 s in the network . these data are used to build a flexible network ",
    "specific model that can be estimated _ on  line _ from link  level measurements .",
    "the resulting model will be shown to substantially outperform the _",
    "ordinary network kriging _ methodology .",
    "if the means and covariances are known , then the network prediction problem in the previous section becomes the _ simple kriging _",
    "problem from spatial statistics .",
    "the best linear unbiased predictor ( blup ) for @xmath39 in terms of @xmath40 is then given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mean and the covariance matrix of the vector @xmath24 , which is partitioned into an _ observed _ and _ unobserved _ components @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "for simplicity , we omit the argument ` @xmath12 ' in , but it is implicitly present in all quantities therein . the ( conditional ) covariance matrix of prediction errors @xmath47 is given by : @xmath48    the performance of the simple kriging predictor is illustrated in figure [ fig : baok ] ( top ) , and table [ tab : okrig ] ( @xmath49nd column ) . in these cases , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are estimated from moving windows of past observations , where data on all links is available ( see appendix [ ap : okrig ] ) . in the context of our network prediction problem , however , not all links are observed , the means and covariances are unknown , and the _ simple kriging _ methodology is not practical .",
    "nevertheless , it provides a theoretically optimal benchmark that we will be used to evaluate all methods developed in the sequel .",
    "the relative mean squared errors ( remse ) of the predictors reported in table [ tab : okrig ] , and in the sequel , are computed as follows : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is a predictor for the true value @xmath24 and @xmath54 stands for the euclidean norm .",
    "the remse s quantify empirically the prediction error relative to the energy of the true signal @xmath24 , over the duration @xmath55 . in a controlled setting where @xmath24 is available ,",
    "the remse s allow us to objectively compare the performance of various estimators .",
    "a first practical solution to the network prediction problem may be obtained by using the _ ordinary kriging _ methodology .",
    "namely , suppose that we have no prior information about the statistical behavior of the traffic over the network , but the routing matrix is available .",
    "then reasonable working assumptions are that @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are unknown constant parameters , which vary slowly with time @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the traffic means of all links are equal to @xmath60 , and the covariance matrix of the flow ",
    "level traffic is scalar .",
    "using these assumptions together with the routing equation , one can obtain the best linear unbiased predictor of @xmath46 ( see appendix [ ap : okrig ] and @xcite for more details ) .",

    "provide a complete technical description , we seek to provide intuition for how the data were constructed .",
    "netflow records consist of individual records , each that group a sequence of packets sharing several common characteristics including : source and destination ip address , protocol , source and destination port , and type of service .",
    "these records also include as the number of packets , number of bytes , the start , and end time of the group .",
    "the input and output interfaces were of particular importance in the mapping procedure , since they allow us to identify , for each record , the physical address from where that stream of packets arrived at the router , and the physical address of the next step on the network .",
    "in particular , it allows one to determine whether or not the series of packets arrived from the internet2 backbone and whether it was sent out on the backbone , or to a different network . in the first pass over the data , we create a careful mapping from each ( source ip , destination ip ) pair to a ( source router , destination router ) pair",
    ". then we pass through the data a second time , using our mapping to assign each observed flow to source router and destination router , and thereby assign each observed packet to one of the 72 source / destination flows present on the backbone .",
    "the baseline estimator in section [ sec : general ] is essentially the _ simple kriging _ predictor , which assumes knowledge of the mean and covariance of @xmath62 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) . in practice",
    ", we estimate these quantities from moving windows of past data : @xmath63 and @xmath64    the _ ordinary kriging _ methodology is used in our first solution of the prediction problem in section [ sec : general ] . in this case , @xmath65 is modeled by @xmath66 , where the scale @xmath67 is unknown .",
    "the means @xmath68 are unknown but assumed to be constant across the links @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath70 are allowed to vary slowly with time @xmath12 . in contract , to the baseline estimator , we can no longer use @xmath71 and @xmath72 above since only some links are observed . under these assumptions ,",
    "the least squares optimal linear predictor of a link @xmath46 from @xmath45 becomes @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a matrix of the variograms for the set of observed links @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a vector of cross  variograms between the unobserved link and observed links . for more details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the resulting ordinary kriging coefficients are such that @xmath77 so that the predictor is unbiased . in our application , we calculated the variograms by estimating the unknown parameter @xmath67 from a window of past data from the _ observed links _ @xmath45 .",
