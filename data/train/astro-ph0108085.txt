    "by large - zenith - angle observations we mean targeting an astronomical source with a ground - based telescope when it is more than 45@xmath0 away from the zenith .",
    "many authors have stressed the potential of using imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( cts ) for observations of sources of high - energy @xmath1-rays at large zenith angles ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "several successful observations have already been made ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    since the effective depth of the atmosphere increases to a good approximation as @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 denotes the zenith angle ) , the distance of the telescope to the shower maximum increases proportionally due to the curvature of the earth .",
    "the cherenkov light produced in the shower illuminates a larger area on the ground which leads to an increase in the effective collection area of the ct .",
    "this increase should very roughly be as large as @xmath4 but is in reality even larger due to changes in the shape of the lateral distribution of the cherenkov photons density .",
    "the expected drawbacks of large-@xmath3 observations are an increased energy threshold and possibly worse background suppression since the average cherenkov photon density caused by the shower at the telescope decreases with increasing @xmath3 roughly as @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the angular extension of the shower image decreases .",
    "this means that with a given ct photomultiplier camera , the image is fainter and contained in fewer pixels .",
    "there is less information for distinguishing @xmath1-induced showers from the hadronic background showers .",
    "it is a priori not obvious by how much the gain in collection area will compensate for the decreasing image quality .",
    "a camera with higher angular resolution should suffer less from the effects of shrinking images .",
    "it is therefore especially interesting to investigate the performance of the new granite iii camera on the whipple telescope ( mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona ) which has an angular resolution of 0.12@xmath0 in its central region , the best resolution ever available on this ct .",
    "this camera is described in finley et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .    in this article",
    "we derive the performance of granite iii as a function of the zenith angle @xmath3 and investigate possible improvements to the present standard data analysis which is optimized for small @xmath3 .",
    "we do this by examining the performance of the standard analysis at different zenith angles using simulated @xmath1-showers and real telescope data from off - source observations .",
    "the improvements are then verified using observations of mkn 421 .",
    "it is especially helpful that mkn 421 was in a high state during the observations .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) data used in this study was specially produced using the simulation code described by @xcite .",
    "the agreement of this mc data with the data obtained from the whipple telescope in the 2000/2001 observing season was thoroughly tested .",
    "special measurements of the telescopes point spread function , photomultiplier efficiency , light - cone collection efficiency and the photoelectron - to - digital - count conversion were made and the results included in the simulation ( krennrich et al .",
    "realistic noise was added to the pixel values in order to simulate the night sky background light .",
    "since all shower image parameters are expected to change linearly with the average distance to the shower maximum which is in turn expected to scale with @xmath2 , the mc data was produced at equidistant values of @xmath2 .",
    "table [ tab - mc ] gives an overview of the production parameters .",
    "only gamma primaries were produced . for studies of hadronic showers ,",
    "off - source observations with the whipple telescope were used .",

    "[ fig - efcoltrig ] and [ fig - efcolscuts ] , improvements seem possible mainly at large energies and not so much at large zenith angles .",
    "however , as fig.[fig - effplot3 ] ( left plot ) shows , the background rejection of the supercuts2001 deteriorates dramatically with increasing @xmath3 .",

    "the cut at 15@xmath0 is optimal for all @xmath3 .",
    "the dist cut ( @xmath8dist@xmath9 ) has ( after all other cuts ) a nearly @xmath3-independent efficiency both for @xmath1s and background ( see fig.[fig - effplot3 ] ) .",
    "the peak of the dist distribution for @xmath1s before cuts moves towards smaller values as @xmath3 increases , but for the @xmath1s below @xmath10 the alpha distribution is so broad that more than 60% are eliminated by the alpha cut ( for all @xmath3 ) .",
    "also the energy resolution for events with small dist is poor and since the solid angle is small , they constitute a small part of the total events .",
    "the upper dist cut is determined by the field of view of the camera .",
    "it is therefore not necessary to vary the dist cut with @xmath3 .",

    "see text.,width=283 ]     comparison of the width and length distributions ( after all other cuts ) for observations of mkn 421 and off - source positions at small and large zenith angles .",
    "see text.,width=283 ]    the lower cuts on width and length ( width@xmath11 and length@xmath12 ) are dictated by the optics of the telescope and therefore nearly independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this is illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig - widthlength ] and [ fig - m4widthlength ] .",
    "while their lower end remains at the same values , the width and length distributions become , however , more narrow as @xmath3 increases and a @xmath3-independent cut has too large background efficiency ( see also fig.[fig - effplot3 ] ) .",
    "the upper cuts on width and length ( width@xmath13 and length@xmath14 in the supercuts2001 ) are therefore the prime candidate for improving the background rejection .",
    "finally , the cut on length / size ( @xmath15/photoelectron ) ) shows a constant @xmath1-efficiency and a decreasing background efficiency with increasing @xmath3 ( see fig.[fig - effplot3 ] ) . here , little improvement seems possible .     the upper width and length cut values with @xmath1-efficiency 84% as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the cuts are calculated by adding one standard deviation to the mean of the distribution .",
    "see text.,width=241 ]    in order to improve the background rejection of the upper cuts on width and length , we examine as a function of @xmath3 the cut value with a @xmath1-efficiency of 84% .",
    "since both the width and the length distributions for pure @xmath1s after cuts are gaussian to a very good approximation , we determine the mean and the standard deviation of the simulated distributions at each value of @xmath3 by fitting a gaussian .",
    "the sum of mean and standard deviation is then plotted versus @xmath2 ( fig.[fig - widthxvsza ] ) .    as one would expect from the geometry of the shower observation",
    ", there is a linear dependence of the shower image size , and therefore also the width and length values under discussion , on @xmath2 .",
    "the result of a linear fit to the two groups of points is given in fig.[fig - widthxvsza ] . in order to obtain an expression for @xmath3-dependent upper cuts on width and length ,",
    "we scale the two lines such that they assume the supercuts2001 value at the zenith angle where the supercuts were optimized which is @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting cuts are : @xmath17 we replace the corresponding @xmath3-independent cuts in the supercuts2001 by the cuts in equation [ equ - newcuts ] and compare the performance of this new set of cuts ( the `` zenith - angle - dependent supercuts '' ) with that of the standard supercuts2001 .",

    "furthermore , the overall quality factor ( @xmath1-efficiency divided by the square - root of the background efficiency ) drops from 4.7 to 2.7 for the standard supercuts2001 when going from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , while it drops only to 3.2 when the @xmath3-dependent cuts are used .    the improvement in sensitivity is verified using the mkn 421 observations .",
