    "the discovery of many blazar - type agns ( e. g. , hartman et al . 1992 ) as sources of high - energy @xmath0-ray radiation , dominating the apparent luminosity , has revealed that the formation of relativistic jets and the acceleration of energetic charged particles , that generate nonthermal radiation , are key processes to understand the energy conversion process .",
    "emission from relativistically moving sources is required to overcome @xmath0-ray transparency problems implied by the measured large luminosities and short time variabilities ( for review see dermer & gehrels 1995 ) .",
    "dermer , miller & li ( 1996 ) have recently inspected the acceleration of energetic electrons and protons in the central agn plasma by comparing the time scales for stochastic acceleration with the relevant energy loss time scales .",
    "their results demonstrate that with reasonable central agn plasma parameter values low - frequency turbulence can energize protons to tev and pev energies where photo - pair and photo - pion production are effective in halting the acceleration ( sikora et al . 1987 , mannheim & biermann 1992 ) . once the accelerated protons reach the thresholds for the latter processes they will generate plenty of secondary electrons and positrons of ultrahigh energy which are now injected at high energies into the acceleration scheme .",
    "the further fate of the secondary particles depends strongly on whether they find themselves in a compact environment set up by the external accretion disk , or not .",
    "secondary particles within the photosphere will initiate a rapid electromagnetic cascade which has been studied by e.g. mastichiadis & kirk ( 1995 ) , which might even lead to runaway pair production and associated strong x - ray flares ( kirk & mastichiadis 1992 ) , and/or due to the violent effect of a pair catastrophy ( henri , pelletier & roland 1993 ) ultimately lead to an explosive event and the emergence of a relativistically moving component filled with energetic electron - positron pairs .",
    "it is the purpose of the present investigation to follow the time evolution of the relativistic electrons and positrons as the emerging relativistic blob moves out .",
    "we generalize the approach used in earlier work ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 , dermer , sturner & schlickeiser 1996 ) by accounting for klein - nishina effects and including external inverse - compton scattering as well as synchrotron self - compton scattering self - consistently .",
    "we assume the relativistic pairs to be isotropically distributed in a spherical volume of radius @xmath1 , located at height @xmath2 above the accretion disk plane .",
    "the minimum lorentz factor of the pairs at the time of injection is expected to be in the range of the threshold value of the primary protons lorentz factor for photo - pair production .",
    "we find this threshold at @xmath3 .",
    "the pair distribution above this cutoff basically reflects the acceleration spectrum of the protons which can extend up to @xmath4 .",
    "the lack of a significant cut - off at high photon energies due to @xmath0-@xmath0 pair production in the egret spectra of many @xmath0-ray blazars and in particular the detection of tev @xmath0-rays from mrk  421 suggests that a new jet component must be produced / accelerated outisde the @xmath0-ray photosphere for tev photons .",
    "we find this photosphere due to the interaction of @xmath0-rays with accretion disk radiation to be located around @xmath5  pc where @xmath6 is the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath7 .    the blob is assumed to move outward perpendicularly to the accretion disk plane with velocity @xmath8 .",
    "the cooling mechanisms we take into account are inverse - compton scattering of accretion disk photons ( eic ) , synchrotron and synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) losses to arbitrarily high order . for comparison to observations ,",
    "we calculate the time - averaged emission , since the integration times of present - day @xmath0-ray observing instruments are much longer than the cooling time - scales resulting from our simulations .",
    "we used our code to fit the spectra of three @xmath0-ray blazars , namely the flat - spectrum radio quasar 3c279 , the bl - lac object mrk  421 and the quasar pks  1622 - 297 . throughout our calculations",
    ", we assumed @xmath9  km  s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the fits to mrk  421 , as shown in fig . 1 , are discussed in detail in bttcher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the quasar 3c279 was observed in a broad - band campaign by hartman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) during an outburst in 1991 june and in a more quiescent state in 1991",
    "september  october . for the latter phase ,",
    "unfortunately , no simultaneous observations in the infrared  optical  uv band were available .",
    "the typical flare timescale of this object is several days , which restricts the size of the emitting region to @xmath13  cm where @xmath14)^{-1}$ ] is the doppler factor .",
    "our fits to the quiescent and the flaring phase of 3c279 are shown in fig .",
    "the parameters for the quiescent state were    @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the cutoffs of the initial pair distributions , @xmath17 is the initial spectral index of the particle spectra ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath2 is the height of the injection site above the accretion disk plane , @xmath19 is the total luminosity of the accretion disk and @xmath20 is the masss of the central black hole .",
    "recently , mattox et al . (",
    "1997 ) have reported an intense @xmath0-ray flare of the quasar pks  1622 - 297 during which the x - ray and the @xmath0-ray spectrum can be represented by two different power - laws .",
    "our model calculation , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 , demonstrates that the combined ssc / eic model is well suited to reproduce such a two - component spectrum .",
