    "in current scenario , finding new sources for power generation are very important to fulfill the demand of electricity . various renewable energy sources like solar pv cell , wind turbine , etc . are discovered and currently are using at large scale .",
    "various other sources have also been discovered but are in development stage .",
    "power generation through thermolectric ( te ) materials is one of them .",
    "research is going on in this field to find good te materials , specially for high temperature application .",
    "a good te material should have a high seebeck coefficient ( @xmath2 ) , low thermal conductivity ( @xmath0 ) , and high electrical conductivity ( @xmath3 ) . combining all three parameters ,",
    "a common term introduced called figure of merit defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean temperature across te material . a good te material should have high z@xmath5 value .",
    "all three parameters have to be measured to find the value of z@xmath5 . among these three properties ,",
    "@xmath0 is most difficult to measure experimentally .",
    "various available methods to measure @xmath0 are discussed in ref . [ 1 ] .",
    "measurement methods are categorized in two parts , steady - state based and non - steady state based methods .",
    "non steady state based methods like laser pulse method , 3@xmath6-method , etc .",
    "require very less time for measurement as compared to steady state based methods .",
    "laser pulse method is used most widely in commercial instruments but it is limited to thin disc sample only.@xcite 3@xmath6-method is also a popular technique , where time delay between the heating of the sample and the temperature response is used to measure @xmath0.@xcite steady state based methods , like axial heat flow technique , comparative technique , guarded heat flow technique , heat - flow meter technique , etc .",
    "are also used for measurement.@xcite the benefit of steady state based methods are that , setup cost is low and samples with various shapes and dimensions can be characterized .",
    "steady state based axial heat flow method is a basic technique in which one - dimensional fourier s law of thermal conduction equation is used to measure @xmath0 , which can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the net heat flow through the sample .",
    "a , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are cross - sectional area of the sample , its thickness , and temperature difference across it , respectively .",
    "the main difficulty with this method is to measure the heat flow through the sample ( @xmath8 ) accurately .",
    "this difficulty arises due to the undefined amount of heat loss during the heat transfer process by conduction , convection and radiation , which becomes important at high temperature.@xcite various instruments are reported based on this method for the measurement of @xmath0 . _",
    "_ muto et al.__@xcite used a heat flux sensor to measure @xmath8 . _ _ amatya et al.__@xcite used comparative axial heat flow technique to measure @xmath8 . in this technique",
    ", a sample is sandwiched between standard reference materials of known @xmath0 .",
    "radiation losses are taken care by using some physical model . _",
    "_ zawilski et al.__@xcite discussed a different approach to find the value of @xmath8 , called parallel thermal conductance technique . in this technique , heat loss",
    "is measured by running the instrument without sample .",
    "this heat loss data is act as a baseline for @xmath0 measurement . using this technique",
    ", they performed measurement from 12 k to room temperature .",
    "further , _ _ dasgupta et al.__@xcite used this technique and performed measurement at high temperature .",
    "they developed a model in which by using heat loss data the value of heater constant was obtained .",
    "the value of heater constant depends on the specific heat , mass , etc .",
    "of the heater block .",
    "further this heater constant is used for thermal conductivity measurement .",
    "this technique was implemented by using a lifting mechanism for the heater .",
    "heater heats the side wall of copper rod and this copper block heat the sample .",
    "they put the sample holder in a glass chamber and kept it in a furnace .",
    "in the above discussed instruments , various techniques are used to measure @xmath8 .",
    "use of heat flux sensor limit the measurement temperature , as it is not suitable for high temperature applications .",
    "similarly , comparative axial heat flow technique requires standard reference materials and number of temperature sensors .",
    "radiation loss at high temperature is estimated by using some physical model . to get a more accurate result by using the method discussed by _",
    "zawilski et al .",
    "_ heat loss should be as low as possible .",
    "use of bulk heater causes more heat loss as it heat side walls and also high temperature surface is directly exposed to chamber environment .    in this work ,",
    "we have developed a fully automated low cost setup for high temperature @xmath0 measurement .",
    "the parallel thermal conductance technique is used for @xmath8 measurement .",
    "we implemented this technique in such a way that , there is no requirement of furnace and lifting mechanism for heater .",
    "heat loss is minimized by using low thermal conductive gypsum as an insulator block with small cross sectional area .",
    "thin heater is built to heat the sample .",
    "its negligible surfaces are exposed which also minimized the heat loss .",
    "the use of thin heater and small cross section insulator block minimizes the size of the sample holder assembly .",
    "this small size sample holder requires limited components , which make it lightweight .",
    "thin heater is built with 4-probe contacts , by which we can measure accurate power delivered to the heater .",
    "labview based program with computer interfacing system is used to control the whole measurement process .",
    "@xmath1 , polycrystalline bismuth , gadolinium and alumina samples are used to validate the instrument .",
    "the data collected on these samples are found to be in good agreement with the reported data .",
    "we also report the @xmath0 of the polycrystalline tellurium .",
    "for the measurement of @xmath0 , one - dimensional fourier s law of thermal conduction equation is used . as discussed in previous section , accuracy of the measurement",
    "mainly depends on the value of @xmath8 . for this",
    "we have to find the heat loss value , which includes heat loss from the side walls of the sample , hot side copper block surface and insulator block surfaces .",
    "heat loss occurred from the side walls of the sample by means of conduction , convection and radiation to the air . at high vacuum ( @xmath11 ) , this heat loss is less than 1 %  of the total heat flow through the sample , even at high hot side temperature ( above @xmath12c ) , which can be ignored.@xcite heat loss in this system is mainly due to the heat flow by conduction through the insulator block , which is used to support the heater .",
    "radiation losses from the hot side copper block surface and insulator surface are also considerable and can not be ignored , specially at high temperature .",
    "so , mainly heat loss is due to the insulator block by conduction and radiation and hot side copper block by radiation .    for our system , heat generated by the heater",
    "is mainly divided into two paths .",
    "one is through sample and another is through the insulator block .",
    "heat loss through insulator block is obtained by running the instrument without sample .",
    "this method to find heat loss is known as parallel thermal conductance technique.@xcite hot side temperature with respect to vacuum chamber temperature ( @xmath13 ) is recorded along with the power supplied to the heater .",
    "room temperature is maintained at 300 k throughout the measurement process . as power supply changes , @xmath13 changes .",
    "the heat loss measurement is performed till the temperature for which @xmath0 measurement has to be performed . a schematic diagram for heat flow without sample and with sample",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "1 . during heat loss measurement , the heat generated in the heater flows through the insulator block by conduction ( @xmath14 ) and through the surface of insulator block and hot side copper block by radiation ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the heat loss equation can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the net power delivered to the heater during heat loss measurement .    during @xmath0 measurement ,",
    "the sample is placed in the sample holder so the heat generated by the heater flows though the insulator as well as the sample also . the heat flow equation with a sample",
    "can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the net power delivered to the heater during @xmath0 measurement .",
    "this @xmath8 obtained using above equation is used to calculate the @xmath0 of the sample .",
    "the actual photograph of the sample holder assembly is shown in fig .",
    "2 , where different components are represented by numbers . the sample , * _ 1 _ *",
    ", is sandwiched between two copper blocks , * _ 2 _ * & * _ 3 _ * , of @xmath20 cross section and 2 mm thickness .",
    "the two k - type ptfe shielded thermocouples , * _ 4 _ * & * _ 5 _ * , of 36 swg are embedded at the center of each copper block .",
    "measured @xmath10 includes the temperature gradient generated due to the 1 mm of each copper block , the thermal resistance of interface surfaces and the sample .",
    "this instrument is used to measure sample of low thermal conductivity ( up to 30 w / m.k ) , where the temperature gradient due to copper block is negligible as it has a very high thermal conductivity ( @xmath21400 w / m.k at room temperature ) .",
    "gasn liquid metal eutectic is used at the interface surfaces .",
    "its thin film is generated at the interface surfaces , which minimized the interface resistance .",
    "its boiling temperature is @xmath211800 k , which make it suitable at very high temperature also .",
    "13 @xmath22 thin heater , * _ 6 _ * , is used to heat the sample .",
    "it is made by winding 40 swg kanthal wire over the alumina sheet of @xmath23 cross section and 0.6 mm of thickness .",
    "each end of kanthal wire is welded with two nickel wires of 35 swg by using gas welding . at each end , one wire is used to supply power and another is used to measure the voltage across kanthal wire . this 4-wire technique measures exact power delivered to the heater .",
    "this heater is further coated with high temperature cement and fixed over gypsum insulator block , * _ 7 _ * , by using high temperature cement .",
    "gypsum is used for this purpose as it has a very low thermal conductivity ( @xmath210.017 w / m.k at room temperature ) and can be used at high temperature also.@xcite as heat loss is very important and should be as low as possible , we take gypsum insulator block of @xmath20 cross section area and 25 mm thickness .",
    "further , we minimized its effective cross sectional area by making a cylindrical hole across its thickness .",
    "this insulator block is supported by a brass plate , * _ 8 _ * , by using high temperature cement .",
    "this brass plate is fixed with a brass rod , * _ 9 _ * , using screw , * _ 10_*. insulator block , * _ 11 _ * , is also used at the cold side to insulate sample electrically and optimize @xmath10 across it .",
    "ss rod , * _ 12 _ * , of 6 mm diameter and 60 mm length are used to apply pressure over the sample .",
    "this rod is having round tip at its end , which allows self aligning of the surfaces at the interface of sample and copper blocks .",
    "this self aligning ensures uniform pressure throughout the sample cross section .",
    "another brass plate , * _ 13 _ * , is used to screw this ss rod .",
    "it is fixed over a plane ss rod , * _ 14 _ * , of 6 mm dia .",
    "use of two different rods provide two independent paths for heat flow .",
    "brass rod is for heat loss and ss rod is for heat flow through the sample .",
    "brass rod and plane ss rod are fixed on a ss flange . on this ss flange ,",
    "hermetically sealed electrical connector is fixed to make electrical connections .",
    "pt-100 rtd is connected to this connector to measure the temperature of the chamber .",
    "this sample holder assembly is placed inside the vacuum chamber , which is made by using seamless ss pipe of 10 cm diameter and 30 cm in height .",
    "kf25 port is provided over the vacuum chamber at the bottom .",
    "this port is used to connect this chamber with vacuum pump .",
    "diffusion vacuum pump is used to create a vacuum inside the chamber upto a level of @xmath24 mbar . at this level of vacuum , the conduction and convection loss through the air can be ignored because of this pressure thermal conductivity of air is 3@xmath25 w / m.k .",
    "it is four order of magnitude lower than thermal conductivity at atmospheric pressure.@xcite    keithley 2604b ( smu ) is used to supply power to the heater and keithley 2002 multimeter ( dmm ) with 10 channel scanner card is used to measure various signals .",
    "smu is used in constant current mode and based on the resistance of the heater , power value is defined .",
    "the complete measurement process is controlled by a labview program . before starting the program",
    ", the user needs to fill sample details , control parameters ( step increment in the power supply , number of data average , and @xmath26 limit ) .",
    "heat loss data is also inserted into the string .",
    "a fixed power is supplied at each data point and based on this power , a temperature is achieved .",
    "steady state is ensured by monitoring @xmath26 , continuously and its rate of change is obtained",
    ". a very small rate of change in @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is defined as steady state criteria .",
    "once the rate of change of @xmath26 comes below this set value , measurement starts .",
    "the random error generated in the measurement is minimized by taking an average of multiple data . at each data point",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath28 voltage across the heater and current through it are measured .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is obtained by interpolating heat loss data and then the value of @xmath8 is obtained by subtracting @xmath29 from heater power . at the next step , @xmath0 is calculated using all raw data .",
    "this @xmath0 is plotted online with @xmath5 and all raw data along with @xmath0 is exported to .xls file at a user defined directory .",
    "after completion of this measurement loop , smu increases the power supply to heater by the value defined in control parameter .",
    "this measurement loop continues until @xmath26 reaches a set value defined in control parameter .",
    "once @xmath26 reaches set value , smu stops power supply to the heater .",
    "heat loss values are very important for @xmath0 measurement . at the start of the measurement",
    ", the value of @xmath30 is very low .",
    "a small error in its value can change the result by considerable magnitude . for better result",
    ", @xmath17 should be as low as possible .",
    "it is achieved by using low thermal conductive gypsum as insulator block .",
    "again , the heat loss value is further minimized by reducing the effective surface area . a plot of heat loss with respect to @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
