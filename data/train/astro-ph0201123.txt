    "in a recent paper brocato et al .",
    "( 1999 , paper i ) we have presented the case of the intermediate metallicity globular cluster ngc 6362 , where horizontal branch ( hb ) stars reach a maximum v luminosity at ( b@xmath3v)@xmath40.2 mag , with an overall tilt of the order of @xmath5@xmath40.1 mag , thus of the same order of magnitude of the tilted hb already observed in ngc 1851 ( walker 1998 ) , possibly in ngc 6229 ( borissova et al .",
    "1999 ) and in ngc 6712 ( ortolani et al . 2000 ) . in the same paper",
    "it has been shown that canonical predictions concerning low - mass , he - burning stars with z= 0.002 do foresee such an occurrence , nicely accounting for the observed ngc 6362 hb stars distribution .",
    "thus we regard such a tilt as an evolutionary feature which should characterize all the well populated intermediate metallicity clusters when observed with sufficient photometric accuracy .",
    "the evidence for such a `` canonical '' tilt , as due to the behavior of the bolometric correction , appears of some relevance in connection with the debated problem of the much larger tilts ( @xmath2@xmath40.5 mag ) observed in some metal rich globulars of the inner milky way .",
    "the first evidence for similar unexpectedly large tilts was brought to the light from hst observations of the globulars ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 ( piotto et al .",
    "1997 , rich et al .",
    "sweigart and catelan ( 1998 ) drove the attention on such a feature , regarding it as an observational evidence requiring non - canonical evolutionary scenarios . in the present paper",
    "we investigate evolutionary predictions concerning the color - magnitude ( cm ) distribution of metal rich hb stars . in the next section",
    "we will present new sets of canonical hb models , whereas section 3 will deal with their cm diagram and theoretical uncertainties , due to the efficiency of the convection in superadiabatic layers , which affect the predicted luminosity of stars at the red hb end . in section 4 we will provide arguments and constraints to understand the origin of the large tilt of the high metallicity clusters ngc  6441 and ngc  6388 .",
    "final remarks will close the paper .",
    "the recent literature has already devoted considerable attention to metal rich hb structures .",
    "starting from the pioneering paper by horch , demarque & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) several works have been presented covering this issue with rather detailed evaluations ( dorman , rood & oconnel 1993 , fagotto et al .",
    "1994 , yi et al .",
    "1997 , bono et al .",
    "1997 , girardi et al .",
    "however , these studies have been mainly devoted to investigating the evolution of hb structures in connection with either the uv excess in elliptical galaxies or the pulsational properties of metal rich rr lyrae variables and , to our knowledge , up to recent times no attention was devoted to the predicted distribution of metal rich hb stars in the cm diagram .",
    "to investigate such an issue , we decided to extend the evolutionary computations given in paper i for z=0.002 to higher metallicities .",
    "similar computations have been recently presented by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) but for a more restricted range of metallicity , not addressing the problem of tilt .",
    "however , this will allow an useful comparison between the results of the two theoretical scenarios for a common value of z.    in this paper , zero age horizontal branch ( zahb ) models have been produced by following selected stellar models all along their h - burning phase till the ignition of the he flash , deriving in this way the mass of the he core of new born he burning stars with an age of the order of 10 gyr , in agreement with several recent estimates of the age of metal rich gcs ( salaris & weiss 1997 , gratton et al .",
    "1997 , chaboyer et al .",
    "1998 , cassisi et al . 1999 ) . for a detailed discussion on the physical inputs adopted in the computations we refer to cassisi et al .",
    "table  1 gives selected parameters for the above quoted models .",
    "left to right one finds : original he abundance , metallicity and mass of the model , mass of the he core at the he ignition , surface he abundance after the first dredge up and , finally , star age and luminosity at the rgb tip .    as shown in table 1 , to extend the investigation in paper i at higher metallicities , we selected two `` suitable '' values of z , choosing z=0.006 as representative of `` metal rich '' clusters like 47  tuc and z=0.02 as a safe upper limit for globular cluster metallicities .",
    "as in paper i , the present computations have been performed by adopting a mixing length parameter @xmath1=1.6 , implemented with the case @xmath1=1.0 to explore the effect of mixing length assumptions .",
    "figure  1 gives the predicted distribution of these models in the log(l / l@xmath6 , logt@xmath7 hr diagram .",
    "as labelled in the figure , the amount of original he ( y@xmath8 ) has been increased with z according to @xmath9y/@xmath9z @xmath42.5 , as suggested by current evaluation on that matter ( see , e.g. , peimbert 1995 , fernandes et al .",
    "1998 ) . as a whole",
    ", one finds that data in both table  1 and figure  1 appear in general agreement with previous evaluations given by dorman , rood & oconnel ( 1993 ) and yi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , our models being slightly brighter as a consequence of larger initial he cores ( as discussed in cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "as expected , figure  1 shows that the effective temperature of red hb stars depends on the assumption about the mixing length .",
    "this implies that , at any given temperature , the luminosity of the red portion of the zahb depends on the assumptions on the mixing length , increasing when the mixing length increases .",
    "this dependence grows with the stellar metallicity , since at higher metallicities the hb locus moves toward lower effective temperatures and red hb star are increasingly affected by external convection , making stellar models more sensitive to the adopted efficiency of the super - adiabatic convection . as we will discuss in the next section",
    ", this will leave some uncertainty in theoretical predictions on tilted hb .",
    "making use of model atmospheres by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997 ) previous results have been translated into cm diagrams .",
    "figure  2 shows the predicted location of the computed zahb sequences in the ( @xmath10 , b@xmath3v ) and ( @xmath10 , v@xmath3i ) diagrams , for the two choices of the mixing length .",
    "the same figure shows the predicted location of the corresponding rg branches for @xmath1=1.6 , which gives a reasonable approximation to the observed rgb colors when adopting the above atmosphere models ( cassisi et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the investigated range of metallicity",
    "all the zahbs , for each adopted value of the mixing length , show a canonical tilt , by an amount which is largest at the highest explored metallicity . as a matter of fact",
    ", the dependence on the metallicity already discussed in the previous section is now amplified by the parallel increase of the bolometric correction as the stellar temperatures decrease .    by relying on a reasonable accuracy of adopted model of atmospheres ,",
    "rgb models with a mixing length parameter as low as @xmath1=1.0 are ruled out , since they would have exceedingly red colors ( see for example figure 3 in paper i ) .",
    "thus , if one takes @xmath1=1.6 for the actual rgb stars and assumes a common value of the mixing length in both rgb and hb structures , canonical theory predicts a tilt growing from @xmath2@xmath40.05 mag when z=0.002 up to @xmath2@xmath40.2 mag when z=0.02 .    on the other hand , if one assumes a less efficient convection in red hb stars ( i.e. a shorter mixing length ) than in rgb structures , this tilt could increase , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "in such a case one could invoke either an exceedingly larger cluster age or a not negligible amount of mass loss to avoid the hb crossing the rgb , an occurrence which would run against well established observational evidence . however , such a scenario appears rather artificial , so that we will base the following discussion on the predictions for the case @xmath1=1.6 , as a reasonable approximation of actual stellar structures , suggesting that the above uncertainty on the tilt should hardly exceed few hundredth of magnitude .",
    "such a canonical tilt can be obviously observed only in clusters with a zahb covering a suitable range of temperatures , whereas for those with only red hb one would only detect the sloping red portion of the branch .",
    "according to the hb models presented here , over the range 0.5 @xmath11 b@xmath3v @xmath11 1.0 , the predicted slope for the solar metallicity is of the order of @xmath12@xmath40.24 . for even redder colors ,",
    "models reach their redder hb limit , and luminosity starts increasing with the mass as early predicted by caloi , castellani & tornamb ( 1978 ) .",
    "one has also to discuss whether evolutionary effects can mask the discussed zahb distribution .",
    "figure  3 shows the evolutionary paths of selected hb models for the two given choices on metallicity . for z=0.006",
    "all the evolutionary tracks lie above the zahb locus , so that the lower envelope of the observed distribution keeps being defined by the zahb , thus preserving the sloping behavior discussed in this section .",
    "this is not the case for solar metallicities , where the zahb is crossed by the model having the blue hook just below the point where its luminosity is at maximum .",
    "however , such an occurrence will decrease the tilt by less than 0.009 mag , thus again substantially preserving the predicted canonical tilt .",
    "let us finally compare our results with evolutionary data recently presented by vandenberg et al .",
    "inspection of fig.3 in that paper ( lower panel ) discloses that in the case @xmath13=0 $ ] increasing the metallicity causes a tilt to appear , reaching a maximum value of the order of @xmath2@xmath40.08 mag at the largest investigated metallicity z=0.01 . from data shown in our fig .  2 one finds @xmath2@xmath40.06 when z=0.006 and @xmath2@xmath40.18 mag for solar metallicity .",
    "by a linear interpolation on log z it follows @xmath2@xmath40.10 at z=0.01 , i.e. one finds that both results appear in reasonable agreement , with vandenberg et al .",
    "predicting marginally smaller tilts .",
    "one can further discuss the origin of the marginal difference , bearing in mind that the predicted tilt is the combined result of both zahb models and bolometric corrections .",
    "luckily enough , comparison of fig.s 1 in both papers discloses that we have a quite similar treatment of external convection , since zahb models with the same chemical composition reach a quite similar minimum temperature .",
    "thus the difference is not an effect of the already discussed dependence of the tilt on the mixing length . on the contrary",
    ", there are several differences both in modeling stellar structures and in color transformations which could be at the origin of the differences .",
    "we do not use the same approach for the conductive opacities ( itoh et al .",
    "1983 in our computations against hubbard & lampe 1969 ) , for the equation of state ( eos ) ( rogers et al . 1996 ) against an improved version of vandenberg ( 1992 ) eos and , in particular our program takes into account element sedimentation all along the pre - hb evolutionary phases ( castellani et al .",
    "moreover , we use the color - effective temperature transformations and the bc scale by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997 ) against bell & gustafsson ( 1989 ) and vandenberg & bell ( 1985 ) . when all these differences are taken into account",
    ", one can conclude that the reasonable agreement between present and vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) results can be taken as a encouraging evidence for the reality of tilted hb , as a well established feature in all modern canonical hb models .",
    "in the previous section we have found that canonical hb models predict moderately tilted hb morphologies .",
    "however , in the well known cases of ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 , one finds evidence for a tilt of the order of @xmath2@xmath40.5 mag , i.e. definitely much larger than predicted on canonical theoretical grounds . to the light of such an evidence , in this section",
    "let us discuss observational data for these clusters in order to gain further informations on observational evidences on that matter .",
    "for the sake of the discussion figure  4 gives the cm diagram of ngc  6441 as derived from hst observations ( piotto et al .",
    "2001 ) , with the clear evidence for the above mentioned tilt .    to be conservative",
    "one can not easily exclude a contribution to the observed tilt from stars evolved from the blue hb tail , crossing the cm diagram at ( b@xmath3v)@xmath14@xmath40 at luminosities larger than the zahb location .",
    "however , as first noted by piotto et al . ( 1997 ) and recently reinforced by pritzl et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the cluster appears peculiar not only for the tilted nature of the whole hb but also for the slope of the hb red portion . as shown in fig .  4 , the lower envelope of observed hb stars runs as @xmath15@xmath41.5 . comparison with theoretical predictions , as given in the previous fig .  3 ,",
    "shows that also in this respect canonical theory can not account for such a feature .      in both ngc  6441 and",
    "ngc  6388 the evidence for the tilt is accompanied by the parallel and unexpected occurrence of extended , extremely blue hb , against the general red morphology of metal rich hb .",
    "thus one is tempted to speculate whether the tilt and the `` blue tail '' originate both from a common mechanism . as a matter of fact ,",
    "sweigart & catelan ( 1998 ) already suggested three non - canonical scenarios accounting for these features , as given by i ) abnormally high original y abundances , ii ) a spread in he cores due to stellar rotation , and , iii ) differential deep mixing along the rgb .",
    "however , the occurrence of an extremely high original y in this cluster has been already discarded by layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) on the basis of the r method , whereas moehler , sweigart & catelan ( 1999 ) found that spectroscopic results for blue hb stars in these clusters are not consistent with all these three non - canonical scenarios .    in this context",
    "let us drive the attention on an additional observational evidence running against these three non - canonical suggestions , as given by the occurrence of a well defined `` bump '' along the rg branches of both clusters .",
    "the occurrence of these bumps is clearly detectable in the original paper by rich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for both ngc  6388 and ngc  6441 .",
    "zoccali et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have already discussed the rgb bump in ngc  6388 , showing that the luminosity of the bump appears in reasonable agreement with theoretical predictions . here",
    "we suggest that the bump could hardly survive a spread either in stellar rotation or in deep - mixing , whereas the `` high helium '' scenario runs against the observations .",
    "in fact , data in figure  4 discloses that , like ngc  6388 , also ngc6441 shows a well defined rg bump below the hb luminosity level at v@xmath418.5 mag . as shown in the left panel of figure  5 , such a feature appears in fine agreement with canonical expectations for y@xmath8=0.27 . on the contrary , the assumption of an original he content as large as y@xmath8=0.43 would produce quite a small bump , and at too low a luminosity with respect to the hb luminosity level ( fig .  5 , right panel ) , at odds with the observations .",
    "thus supporting layden et al .",
    "conclusions on firmer theoretical basis , i.e. by using the rgb bump which is an observational features not affected by the typical uncertainties of hb lifetimes involved in the r - parameter calibration ( cassisi et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in the recent literature it has repeatedly suggested that the peculiar hb in the two clusters could be connected with a spread in the metallicity of cluster stars ( piotto et al .",
    "1997 , sweigart 2000 , pritzl et al .",
    "2001 ) . to discuss this point",
    "we can take advantage of the well developed blue hb of ngc  6388 , covering the abrupt decrease of magnitude defined as the hb - turning down ( hb - td ) in brocato et al .",
    "according to the discussion given in that paper one can safely assume the hb - td as indicator of intrinsic cm location , independently of hb metallicities .",
    "this allow a meaningful comparison of the cm diagram of ngc  6388 with similar diagram but for less metal rich clusters .",
    "to perform such a comparison we choose from the padova hst snapshot data - base the cm diagram for two clusters showing well developed hb blue tail , namely ngc 7099 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath32.12 ) and ngc 2808 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath31.15 ) , both metallicities in zinn and west scale .",
    "the results of such a procedure , as disclosed in figure  6 , allow to put firm constraints on the presence of metal poor stellar populations in ngc  6388 .",
    "if the blue hb stars in this cluster are originated from metal poor progenitors , one should expect along the luminous portion of the rgb as many rgb stars as in the blue hb phases , since the predicted ratio r of hb to rg stars above the hb luminosity level is of the order of unity ( see e.g. zoccali et al .",
    "since the blue hb of ngc  6388 contains 202 stars , one can be confident that the lack of observational evidence of rgb stars in the expected regions in the ngc  6388 diagram excludes the occurrence of metal poor giants with the given metallicities .",
    "one concludes that in ngc  6388 blue hb stars must be originated from rg progenitors with metallicity sensitively larger than the metallicity of ngc 2808 , namely larger than [ fe / h]=@xmath31 , leaving little room to the hypothesis of a spread in metallicity .      in order to save canonical predictions",
    "it has already suggested that differential reddening in these heavy reddened clusters could play a relevant role .",
    "the occurrence of differential reddening in ngc  6441 has been already suggested by piotto et al .",
    "layden et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have recently discussed their ground - based ccd photometry of ngc  6441 , confirming that cluster stars are affected by a rather strong differential reddening . by noticing that the slope of the hb runs according to the reddening vector , these authors conclude that differential reddening should partially contribute to the observed slope . to look into this problem we took advantage of hst observation , looking for the features of cm diagrams in selected cluster areas . as reported in figure  7",
    ", we extracted from the 36.4@xmath1636.4 arcsec@xmath17 image of the planetary camera 16 ( 9.1@xmath169.1 arcsec@xmath17 ) subimages , comparing the cm diagrams of the various areas with the rgb ridge line of area # 6 taken as a reference .",
    "the size of each small area is chosen in order to have a reasonable number of stars in the corresponding rgb .",
    "inspection of data in fig .",
    "7 reveals indeed some relevant features . as a first point ,",
    "one finds clear evidence for the occurrence of rather strong reddening differences , as disclosed , e.g. , by the extreme case of area 4 , where the cm diagram shows a color shift as large as about @xmath18(b@xmath3v)@xmath190.15 mag with respect to the reference diagram .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the maximum differential reddening estimated by heitsch & richtler ( 1999 ) from ground - based observations of the same cluster .",
    "moreover , the reference diagram shows a narrow rg sequence , suggesting that the observed width of the cluster rg branch could be just an artifact of differential reddening across the cluster .",
    "if this is the case , this feature , together with the presence of the blue tail , provides a further constraint against the hypothesis of a spread of metallicity in the cluster stars .",
    "a differential reddening of @xmath20@xmath40.1 appears large enough to produce the observed red - ward slope of the hb . to substantiate such a scenario",
    ", we performed a numerical experiment , applying a random differential reddening by @xmath21 to the observed cm diagram of 47  tuc , in such a way to reproduce the color dispersion observed in the rgb of ngc  6441 .",
    "the result of this experiment , as presented in figure  8 , shows the impressive similarity between ngc  6441 ( fig .  4 ) and",
    "the `` reddened '' 47  tuc .",
    "as a relevant point , neither in ngc 6441 nor in the `` reddened '' 47  tuc the hb slope is exactly along the adopted reddening vector .",
    "this occurance is the natural consequence of randomly reddening a hb which is less sloped than the reddening vector . to get the maximum change in slope one shoud apply the minimum amount of reddening to the hotter red hb stars and a larger amount to the cooler red hb stars",
    "thus , no matter how one builds up the hb in this way the resulting slope of the lower envelope will be less than that of the reddening vector .    while differential reddening",
    "convert a 47  tuc - like hb into one like the red hb of ngc  6441 , it turns out that is not the case . to see this",
    "one can note the thin rgb ( @xmath22@xmath110.1 mag ) shown by the reference diagram # 6 in fig .  7 ( but see also diagrams 5 , 10 , 13 , 14 ) .",
    "this shows that there is not substantial differential reddening within those subsamples .",
    "yet one sees that the red hb in the same diagram is clearly sloping down with increasing b@xmath3v color .",
    "the hb in each subsample has a slope consistent with that of the global sample .",
    "since the slope of each subsample is already fairly large , differential reddening will stretch the hb without substantially changing the slope .",
    "since the large slope is present in even subsample with small differential reddening , it must result from a real behavior of cluster hb stars .",
    "finally , let us note that by applying the same analysis to wfpc2-hst observation of ngc  6388 , we derive results on the differential reddening which are consistent with the previous discussion on ngc  6441 .",
    "heitsch & richtler ( 1999 ) have presented new photometry for five globular clusters in the inner galaxy concluding that differential reddening is indeed responsible for the sloped red hb morphologies at least in the case of ngc 5927 .",
    "however , we have already advanced the suggestion of a real slope at least in ngc  6441 .",
    "an inspection of the cm diagrams for the metal rich globulars in the padova hst snapshot data - base ( piotto et al .",
    "2001 ) plotted in fig .",
    "9 reveals that all the clusters more metal rich than 47tuc , but ngc 6624 , show red hb stars with a slope close to @xmath15=1.5 indicated by the continuous line . as for ngc 6624 a best agreement",
    "is reached with the dotted line , for a slope of the order of @xmath15=1.0 .",
    "note that a similar slope can be clearly detected in the beautiful v , v@xmath3i color - magnitude diagram recently presented by heasley et al .",
    "the hb of 47tuc has a shallow slope , close to the @xmath15=0.2 expected from the theoretical models .    since all the clusters with sloping hb",
    "have also a substantial amount of reddening it appears difficult to ascertain the role of possible differential reddening . in this context , the reduced slope in ngc 6624 could originated either from a smaller differential reddening or from a smaller metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath30.63@xmath230.09 ) as recently discussed by heasley et al .",
    "however , the evidence for sloping red hb in clusters like ngc 6356 or ngc 6624 , with a rather well defined rg sequence , suggest that the sloping red hb is a real feature of metal rich clusters .",
    "if this is the case , one should conclude that sloping hbs _ are not necessarily correlated with the occurrence of blue tails_.    comparison with theoretical predictions in the previous fig .",
    "2 shows that such a slope can be attained by theoretical models only for the shorter mixing length value we already regarded as largely improbable .",
    "if this slope is due to intrinsic properties of hb stars , one should conclude that the observations tell us that when the increasing metallicity pushes the hb at larger b@xmath3v colors , then the red hb slopes down , for unknown reasons .",
    "one would naturally account for such an occurrence by increasing the dependence of the bolometric correction on the temperature , but by an amount that is believed to be beyond current uncertainties .",
    "therefore this remains an open question requiring further investigations .    in this context one",
    "should finally notice that current theoretical procedures adopted in producing hb models start with equilibrium zahb models which neglect all the phases of pre - hb evolution as well as the phases of readjustment of cno elements across the h burning shell ( see , e.g. castellani , chieffi & pulone 1989 ) .",
    "the point is to understand if a pre - zahb evolution can play a role in the observed hb morphologies .",
    "however , a close inspection on the recent models performed to follow the evolution through the he - flash by brown et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and preliminary computations by piersanti l. ( private communication ) do not support such a possibility .",
    "we are grateful to d. vandenberg for providing his theoretical zahb models in ascii format .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the referee for his invaluable work in providing criticism but also very constructive comments and suggestions which greatly improved the final version of the paper .",

    "<S> we investigate the predicted color - magnitude distribution of metal - rich horizontal branch ( hb ) stars , discussing selected theoretical models computed under various assumptions about the star metallicity and the efficiency of super - adiabatic convection . </S>",
    "<S> we find that canonical zero age horizontal branches with metallicity larger or of the order of z=0.002 should be all affected by a tilt , by an amount which increases when the metallicity is increased and/or the mixing length is decreased , reaching a tilt of @xmath00.2 mag in the case of solar metallicity when a mixing length value @xmath1=1.6 is assumed ( @xmath2 is the magnitude difference between the top of the blue hb and the fainter magnitude reached by the red hb ) . </S>",
    "<S> uncertainties in the luminosity of the red hb due to uncertainty in the mixing length value are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the much larger tilt observed in the clusters ngc  6441 and ngc 6388 , reporting additional evidence against suggested non - canonical evolutionary scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments show that differential reddening could produce such sloped hbs . </S>",
    "<S> further , hst - pc imaging of ngc  6441 gives clear indications about the occurrence of differential reddening across the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same imaging shows that the observed slope of the red hb _ is not _ an artifact of differential reddening . </S>",
    "<S> we finally show that sloping red hbs in metal rich clusters are a common occurrence not necessarily correlated with the appearance of extended blue hb . </S>"
