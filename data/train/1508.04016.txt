    "collective motion in active biological systems has been of significant recent interest from flocking birds to collective swimming of microorganisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "though this emergent behavior has been extensively studied , it has yet to be fully understood .",
    "collective motion offers many advantages over individual motion to a given population of organisms including improved mixing , increased diffusion , faster transport , and new effective properties .",
    "the main focus of works over the past few decades has been the study of bacterial suspensions with fewer focusing on insect swarming .",
    "this emphasis on collective swimming of microorganisms is mostly due to the extensive amount of available experimental data ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "however , social behavior in insects is the first form of collective motion one encounters in early childhood .",
    "for example , the migration of butterflies and moths during season changes , swarming bees , and trail formation by ants while foraging for food referred to as _",
    "raiding_. the main feature common to all active biological systems , in contrast to classical passive systems , is the presence of self - propelled motion . for a thorough review of past works on general animal populations ,",
    "see @xcite , and for a review of recent works on active biosuspensions , see @xcite .",
    "we now briefly provide a review of the general behavior of ants extracted from the detailed experimental observations in @xcite .",
    "raiding is common to all ants such as fire ants _ solenopsis invicta _",
    "@xcite , but we focus specifically on army ants of the genus _ eciton _ ( e.g. , _ eciton hamatum _ or _ eciton burchelli _ ) @xcite .",
    "a single army ant colony can consist of up to 200,000 ants and transport up to 3000 food items per hour up to 100 m @xcite .",
    "the general cycle of life for a particular colony consists of bivouac formation ( nest composed of living ant bodies ) , raiding , and migration .",
    "a typical ant raid is carried out during the daylight hours to avoid predators and to allow for time in the evening for the colony to relocate the nest or bivouac under the cover of darkness @xcite .",
    "therefore , an efficient raiding process is crucial for the development and maintenance of a colony ( a similar need for efficiency was investigated in the case of honeybees via a mathematical model introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "raiding itself can have two forms : ( i ) _ column raids _ where ants form narrow bands of chemical pheromone trails to and from a food source and ( ii ) _ swarm raids _ where ants hunt as a large mass and move as essentially a single body @xcite .",
    "this work focuses on the column raids where , in the absence of direct communication , ants rely on the detection of pheromone trails laid by others to both find known food sources or to return to the nest once food has been found .",
    "the ant raiding process consists of three main steps :    \\(i ) initially some ants , referred to as foragers , leave the nest to perform essentially a random walk in search of food .",
    "\\(ii ) once food is found ants lay a special chemical to mark the food location and continue to lay the chemical along the trail back to the nest to attract others .",
    "\\(iii ) when an ant returns with food it , along with other foragers , begins to follow the newly created chemical concentration gradient back to the food .",
    "this chemical gradient is composed of pheromones and has many additional purposes such as transmitting messages about predators or identifying one colony from another @xcite .",
    "this cycle continues thereby keeping the trail pheromones from dissipating until the food source has been depleted .",
    "this marking procedure leads to fascinating collective phenomenon including the formation of  super highways \" consisting of ants traveling back and forth forming lanes for increased mobility as recently observed experimentally in @xcite .",
    "this lane formation is similar to a group of people in a crowded crosswalk at a busy intersection . to ensure everyone makes it to where they are going as efficiently as possible , unconsciously individuals form lanes for increased mobility .",
    "while pheromones play a crucial role in raiding , other local interactions are also important in the dynamics such as collisions . to truly understand the raiding behavior one must develop a model capable of investigating the effects of the relevant physical parameters such as ants size , chemical concentration , receptiveness to pheromone , and noise in foraging on the emergence of a collective state . while there are countless biological studies on ant behavior ,",
    "only recently has mathematics been used to further understanding .",
    "various recent mathematical approaches to modeling and simulation have been capable of capturing remarkable results such as lane formation @xcite , pheromone trails resulting from collective behavior @xcite , and the emergence and depletion of trails based on the concentration of a food source @xcite among others ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , the efficiency in which ants form and follow trails as well as the self - organization of a colony into a collective state has been examined experimentally in @xcite and with an individual based model in @xcite .",
    "a recent continuum model presented in @xcite provides interesting results on ant foraging exhibiting spontaneous trail formation and efficient food removal .",
    "while continuum approaches offer the advantage in general of being computationally efficient , they lack the ability to study interactions at the microscopic level and their effect on the resulting macrostate as well as only offering results  on average \" .",
    "other previous models seeking to capture trail formation , such as @xcite , impose an artificial pheromone gradient or a directional preference in the ants from the onset without allowing for it to be produced by the system itself .",
    "in contrast , this work seeks to improve on past models and provide additional insight through the development of a new first principles coupled pde / ode model for the pheromone concentration and ant dynamics respectively using basic principles learned over time from the immense works on modeling bacterial suspensions ( including our own @xcite ) . as in the study of bacterial suspensions",
    "we seek to strip the model of inessential features and leave only those , which truly account for collective behavior .",
    "our model allows for the direct investigation of individual interactions at the microscopic level and their contribution to both the onset of collective behavior as well as local traffic lane formation .",
    "this work will show that lane formation naturally results from each ant s desire to avoid collisions , which impede their motion .",
    "also , a posteriori we observe the model has a further advantage in that it allows one to show a continuous kinetic phase transition with respect to certain physical parameters and investigate the critical behavior in the population of foragers near the transition .    though previous approaches have been developed to study the ant raiding cycle based on a continuum pde @xcite , to the author s knowledge this is the first coupled pde / ode model for the entire raiding cycle , which focuses on the movement of individuals rather than the density of ants .",
    "the main benefit of developing this sound mathematical theory is that experiments have limitations such as observation time and a lack of control over some parameters ( e.g. , diffusivity of pheromone or amount of pheromone deposited ) .",
    "analysis of the model will also lead to a better understanding of ant behavior , which will have many ecological impacts in both conservation and pest termination .",
    "this paper adds to the current knowledge on the way to understanding even more complex biological systems such as birds , fish , and potentially even humans .",
    "the purpose of this work is to introduce a new model for ant raiding and show two main results ( i ) the transition to the collective state and ( ii ) the formation of lanes for efficient transport of food back to the nest .",
    "both are investigated in the case of one and multiple food sources .",
    "what separates this work from most others is that our model accounts for the entire raiding process starting from foraging for food , forming a trail , and the resulting transition to the collective raiding state . in addition , the model presented herein will deal with the depletion of food and the resulting transition back to individual behavior . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , the main assumptions governing ant raiding are introduced and the coupled pde / ode model for ant dynamics and pheromone concentration are developed .",
    "separate equations of motion are introduced for ant foragers and those returning to the nest with food . in section  [ sec : results ] , results are presented showing a clear phase transition to collective motion through the course of raiding and a transition back to individual motion when the food is depleted .",
    "also , evidence of lane formation along the pheromone trail is presented illustrating the macroscopic traffic - like dynamics formed from the local microscopic interactions matching prior experiment @xcite .",
    "the model is then used to investigate collective dynamics in the case of multiple food sources revealing some differences than in the single raid case . in section  [ sec : pt ] , continuous kinetic phase transitions in the order parameter are shown and the corresponding critical exponents are found .",
    "this illustrates the behavior of the system near the transition to collective motion as a function of relevant biological parameters such as the strength of noise in the system , the rate of pheromone diffusion , and the amount of pheromone deposited .",
    "also , a connection is made to classical thermodynamic systems with similar critical behavior . finally in section  [ sec : disc ] , the results are discussed and related to current biological knowledge as well as outlining potential future additions to make the model even more robust .",
    "the key idea behind the model developed herein is to divide the ants into two classes : foragers and returners each with different equations of motion , because each is motivated by different environmental and social cues @xcite .",
    "the similarity between the two classes is that both are self - propelled and want to avoid collisions with one another , yet they differ in their attraction to the chemical gradient or lack thereof .",
    "we represent each individual ant as a point with an excluded volume , see figure  [ fig : repulsive ] .",
    "the center of mass and velocity for an individual ant are governed by odes describing the evolution of each in time .",
    "we suppress the details of the ant body so that the simulation of such a model is made simpler , yet still captures the desired results . to account for the correct behavior ,",
    "it is crucial to model the pheromone diffusion carefully @xcite .",
    "thus , a critical component in the equations of motion for each ant is the contribution from the pheromone gradient , denoted @xmath0 , where the pheromone concentration @xmath1 satisfies a parabolic reaction - diffusion pde introduced in section  [ sec : pher ] .",
    "ants in the foraging phase leave the nest location in search of food . until a food source is found no pheromone gradient exists and",
    "motion is dominated by a random walk @xcite . after a food source is identified and marked by pheromone , then other foragers , which encounter the pheromone gradient ,",
    "follow it . after reaching the food source",
    "each ant becomes a returner and follows a direct path back towards the nest ignoring the pheromone concentration gradient .",
    "when a returner reaches the nest or bivouac it transitions back to being a forager and the cycle repeats .",
    "it is assumed throughout this work that returners know where their home is and take the most direct path toward it .",
    "the fact that the path back is direct has been observed experimentally in @xcite where even detouring ants by imposing barriers after the food source is found does not dissuade them from following the most direct path . in these works",
    "it is noted that ants can follow landmark routes and recognize locations to navigate .",
    "their evidence suggests that ants can use path integration and their knowledge of complex outbound routes to return home along a straight path .",
    "ants do not use complicated path integration in the same way as a human , but rather use an approximation accounting for navigational errors @xcite .    .",

    ", height=120 ]    we assume the colony of ants are self - propelled particles represented by a set of points @xmath3 .",
    "each point can be thought of as the location of the center of mass for an individual ant .",
    "the velocities of each ant @xmath4 are tracked as well as their orientation @xmath5 . even though an ant is modeled as a point , in reality , the centers of mass for two ants can not become arbitrarily close due to the presence of the body . instead of having to resolve the details of finite size body interactions , which can be computationally expensive , we introduce a truncated repulsive lennard - jones ( lj ) type potential @xmath6 as a function of the interparticle distance @xmath2 @xmath7 + \\ve , & \\quad r \\leq 2^{1/6}\\sigma,\\\\   0 , & \\quad r >",
    "2^{1/6}\\sigma   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 represents the strength of repulsion",
    ". the effective size of an ant is defined by the length @xmath9 where the repulsive forces between two ants balance to zero . in principle",
    "each ant @xmath10 can interact with any other @xmath11 , but these interactions are local in nature .",
    "this force from the @xmath11th ant on the @xmath10th ant is defined as @xmath12 depending only on the relative distance @xmath13 . by introducing the potential ,",
    "the collisions between individual ants are modeled as a soft excluded volume interaction .",
    "the truncated potential has also been successfully used in our recent work on bacteria to impose an effective size on a point particle @xcite .",
    "now one must account for an ant s response to the local pheromone concentration .",
    "ants have elongated bodies and its possible to incorporate this shape through a truncated elliptical potential ( e.g. , a modified gay - berne potential @xcite ) , but is not needed to achieve the desired results and introduces a greater computational expense since the resulting force has an added dependence on the orientation of each ant .      when a foraging ant detects the chemical signature of the pheromone it will use its antennae to analyze the local concentration and decide which direction to travel @xcite . for an extensive review of the background of chemotaxis in ants and its implications for their movement consult @xcite and references therein .",
    "pheromone deposition and trail laying are well modeled by a two - dimensional reaction - diffusion process for the chemical concentration @xmath1 @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the location of the food with initially @xmath16 food items , @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient controlling the rate at which the pheromone spreads , and @xmath18 is the evaporation coefficient that ensures an exponential decay of the pheromone in time .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 represents the amount of pheromone deposited at time @xmath20 and decays as a returning ant moves away from the food source .",
    "this decrease is needed to ensure that the proper gradient forms due to the competition with diffusion .",
    "the function @xmath21 represents the initial distribution of chemical , which is taken as uniform , @xmath22 , or zero so there is no pre - defined directional preference .",
    "the coefficient @xmath18 plays an important role in raiding , because trails that no longer lead to viable food sources should be removed quickly for maximum efficiency .",
    "the trail is defined as the line segment connecting the food source @xmath15 to the nest denoted by location @xmath23 . in this work",
    "we can see the trail naturally form by studying the transition to the collective state and the deviation of individuals from the trail center .",
    "equation captures the exponential decay of the concentration as well as the diffusion to the surrounding environment .",
    "the coupling of the pde for pheromone concentration to the odes governing ant dynamics introduced in section  [ sec : eom ] is analogous to pdes for chemotaxis ( such as keller - segel @xcite ) , which have been used prominently in models for swimming microorganisms @xcite .",
    "we now derive the equations of motion for the evolution of the particle centers of mass @xmath24 from a balance of forces .",
    "the two distinct dynamic models for foraging and returning ants respectively are composed of the different forces associated to each group s behavior .",
    "before the food source is identified , foraging ants perform a random walk , propel themselves in the direction they are currently oriented and try to avoid collisions with other ants . once a food source has been discovered the location , @xmath15 ,",
    "is marked and pheromone starts to diffuse into the surrounding environment .",
    "as previously discussed the collisions will be modeled via a short - range repelling potential described in section  [ sec : assump ] and the pheromone gradient will be induced by a solution to the reaction - diffusion equation presented in section  [ sec : pher ] .    to make the physical description complete",
    "we now introduce the ode model for the dynamics of foraging ants @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a repulsive potential .",
    "the force of self - propulsion is proportional to the velocity via the coefficient @xmath27 .",
    "observe that the term @xmath28 ensures exponential growth or decay to the isolated translational speed @xmath29 .",
    "the pheromone concentration , @xmath1 , enters with relative strength @xmath30 representing the sensitivity of the ants to the chemical gradient when present .",
    "the random walk is controlled through the strength of the noise @xmath31 and a gaussian white noise process @xmath32 with mean zero and variance one .",
    "this white noise process has two purposes : ( i ) to enforce the foraging behavior as a random walk and ( ii ) it can represent a level of misinformation in detecting the chemical trail or a lack of receptivity to the chemical stimulus . a similar approach incorporating stochastic terms has been used recently in @xcite for studying general aggregation of individuals and @xcite for the behavior of locusts .",
    "these dynamic equations are coupled to the pde introduced in section  [ sec : pher ] .",
    "these equations contain three competing factors controlling individual ant dynamics : ( i ) self - propulsion , @xmath33 , ( ii ) excluded volume / collisions , @xmath34 , and ( iii ) pheromone concentration gradient , @xmath35 .",
    "the interplay between these three forces leads to the transition from individual to collective behavior .",
    "the truncation and vertical translation of the original lennard - jones 6 - 12 potential ( see figure  [ fig : repulsive ] ) was imposed so that the force @xmath36 would be lipschitz continuous .",
    "this will prove important if one wants to show the longtime existence for the ode particle equations of motion ( previously done for bacteria in @xcite ) .",
    "once a foraging ant comes into contact with a food source it becomes a returning ant . after acquiring food , the ant proceeds to take the minimal path back to the nest , which is assumed to be a straight line ignoring environmental effects such as elevation or obstacles . as an ant journeys home it still propels itself in the direction it is oriented and tries to avoid collisions with others . to make the physical description complete we now introduce the ode model for the dynamics of returning ants @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit vector directed to the nest with @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath40 governs the relative strength of an ant s desire to return to the nest . as in the dynamic equations for foraging ants ,",
    "the self - propulsion is represented by @xmath33 and the truncated repulsive potential is @xmath26 .",
    "the equations of motion - have a similar form to those developed in @xcite and are reminiscent of _ dorsogna et al .",
    "_ @xcite who considered the stability of collective structures and milling of particles with a similar individual based model ( ibm ) .",
    "the coupled pde / ode model developed in this work provides a more realistic description of the movement , trail laying , and interaction at the microscopic level as compared to previous ode models for ants restricted to a lattice ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for the non - dimensionalization of the system and values for the relevant biological parameters",
    "see appendix  [ app : nd ] . before providing the details of the numerical implementation of the model",
    ", we introduce the order parameter used to measure the correlated behavior of the system .      in order to quantify how correlated the particles are in the system ,",
    "we introduce a reasonable order parameter referred to as the _ flow _ , @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of ants under consideration and @xmath44 represents each ants orientation .",
    "if each individual ant moves in an arbitrary direction , the velocity vectors will effectively cancel each other giving a flow of @xmath45 representing a disordered phase .",
    "if all the ants move in the same direction ( i.e. , toward a food source or the nest ) , then @xmath46 representing an ordered phase .",
    "with this order parameter we can investigate the phase transition that occurs during the course of an ant raid , but some care must be taken in how to apply this definition .",
    "for instance , during the course of the raid the ants will form trails of incoming and outgoing ants moving in opposite directions . in terms of the order parameter , @xmath41",
    ", these two groups would effectively cancel each other s contributions resulting in a net flow near zero .",
    "since we naturally consider two types of ants , foragers and returners , each governed by different dynamic equations , we must consider their flows separately .",
    "thus , the entire system will be described by two order parameters : @xmath47 and @xmath48 using definition , but only summing over the relevant ants . even though the ants change from one group to another numerous times through the course of a raid we will observe that each population still exhibits collective behavior when considered separately .",
    "this particular choice of order parameter for systems of self - propelled particles was first utilized to the author s knowledge by _ vicsek et al . _ in @xcite and applied more recently to ants in @xcite . throughout section  [ sec : results ] this order parameter will be used to investigate the effects of biophysical parameters present in the model on the collective state and in section  [ sec : pt ] it will allow one to show a continuous kinetic phase transition as a function of the those parameters .",
    "numerical implementation of the coupled pde / ode model - is rather straightforward due to its simple nature .",

    ", the foragers and returners naturally self - organize into lanes like cars on a highway or people in a crosswalk .",
    "specifically , foragers who are driven by the chemical gradient occur between .5 - 1.5 ant lengths from either side of the trail with the highest probabilities forming a bi - modal distribution ( see figure  [ fig : lanes]b ) ) . whereas , returners who are driven by their desire to return to the nest as quickly as possible occur at the trail center with highest probability .",
    "we conclude , for the majority of the time along the trail , one lane of returners forms in the trail center and two lanes of foragers flank each side with equal probability .",
    "the formation of three lanes is consistent along the whole trail , but which class of ant is in the middle varies . by employing a microscopic model , unlike a continuum model , we can study different regions of the trail and focus on the local behavior ( see figure  [ fig : lanes]b ) ) . near the nest returning ants are in the center and",

    "the chemical gradient is strong and returners have equal probability of leaving with food on either side of the trail . figures  [ fig : lanes]c ) and d ) focus on how the ant distribution changes between each zone .",
    "how can ants form bi - directional traffic lanes ?",
    "the model suggest it is the result of the excluded volume constraint and the break in symmetry between the social cues for the foragers and returners .",
    "in addition , the lane size introduces an effective length scale , which is dictated by the particle size manifested in the truncated repulsive potential @xmath26 defined in .",
    "this global traffic behavior is consistent with the previous theory and/or experiment in @xcite , where ants self - organize into lanes for optimal transport of food back to the nest .",
    "in addition , such traffic dynamics have also been recently observed in bacteria @xcite . unlike the model presented in @xcite",
    ", we do not impose a directional preference for half the ants , which may artificially contribute to the formation of the bi - modal distribution in that work .",
    "also , in @xcite a turning parameter is used where outbound foragers have a higher avoidance rate , which essentially forces them to the outside of the trail . instead , in this work , the excluded volume forces alone arising from first principles naturally sort the ants .",
    "both models agree on the conclusion that lanes form due to the asymmetry in interactions between foragers and returners .",
    "the second natural question posed concerns the formation of three lanes as opposed to two .",
    "one explanation deduced from experimental observation in @xcite is that a two lane flow would introduce a left - right asymmetry in the trail pattern not naturally present and thus limiting its efficiency .",
    "there may be another explanation .",
    "our model suggests that the desire to return directly home with food outweighs the exponential decay of the chemical gradient away from the food source . in nature ,",
    "when ant is encumbered with food it wants to return to the colony as quickly as possible ( verified experimentally in @xcite ) .",
    "when a foraging ant encounters a returning ant along a trail it is easier for the ant carrying nothing to move out of the way .",
    "this can also be seen in figure  [ fig : lanes ] by noting that the trail width is approximately the size of one ant .",
    "alternatively , the first lane to appear and form is the central one for returners , which forms naturally in the middle to minimize the path back to the nest . once foragers detect the pheromone the returning lane has already formed and they have no choice but to step away from the middle to avoid collisions until they get very close to the food source .",
    "when an ant returns to the nest with food and becomes a forager it has no bias to which side of the pheromone trail it will traverse .",
    "this leads to the bi - modal distribution of foraging ants along side the main trail .",
    "similarly , when a returning ant leaves the food source it can be on either side of the trail explaining figure  [ fig : lanes]d ) .     and the food sources are equi - distant to the nest .",

    "this behavior is captured by imposing a count on the quantity of food items ( e.g. , 2000 - 3500 ) .",
    "once the food source is depleted no foragers can become returners and eventually the whole colony is composed of foragers looking for their next cache of resources .",
    "for some insight into how the food is efficiently broken down and returned to the nest see figure  [ fig : food]a ) for the quantity of food particles as a function of time . since this function has essentially a constant decreasing slope after the trail forms , one could argue the system has reached the maximally efficient state and remains there until the food is gone .",
    "this provides further evidence for lane formation .",
    "if lanes did not form one would expect regions of little decrease in figure  [ fig : food]a ) representing congestion along the trail .",
    "after the trail disappears , @xmath83 , the simulations show that the ant distribution around the trail center for foragers becomes uniform and the lanes cease to exist ( see figure  [ fig : trail]d ) ) . also , after the food has been depleted and the disordered state commences , one may notice local areas of milling behavior similar to @xcite . however , it is not well pronounced due to the presence of the random walk term in the dynamic equations .",

    "different foragers can find each food source near the same time .",
    "each will begin to deposit pheromone and return to the nest .",
    "naturally , foragers begin to detect whichever pheromone is closer to their current location and follow the trail to that food source leading to the formation of two distinct trails",
    ". if the two food sources are at an equal distance from the nest one would expect the emergence of two near equivalent trails forming through the course of the raid .",
    "in contrast , if one food source is significantly closer , one would expect most foragers to detect that pheromone sooner and the vast majority would complete the raid on the first food source before moving to the second .",
    "multiple foraging locations as well as the study of a trail network have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "both cases can be understood by analyzing the pde for the pheromone concentration . since",
    "this equal is linear , multiple food sources can easily be considered by changing the righthand side to @xmath86 if one food source is visited more frequently , then more terms in will direct ants toward that food site .",
    "we use simulations to study the distinct behavior among the two cases : ( i ) equidistant food sources ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : trail2eq ] and online resource 3 ) and ( ii ) food sources at different distances ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : trail2uneq ] and online resource 4 ) .    in the former case , the foraging ants are equally probable to find either food source while completing the random walk .",
    "we observe in simulations that both sites are visited initially , but the site that has more visitors eventually lures all the foraging ants due to the larger pheromone concentration . the typical three lane local dynamics of foragers and returners can be observed on each trail ( see figure  [ fig : lanes2 ] ) . in the case of food sources at unequal distances ,",
    "the foraging ants find the closer food source first as they sweep across the computational domain . once a food source is found in either case almost all foragers",

    "the main question is whether the system will form two coexisting collective states or one collective raid at the first food source and then another at the second .",
    "we use the order parameter for each class of ant to study the current state of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : trans2 ] , shows that there is still a clear transition to the collective state in both cases ; however there are a few subtle differences than in the case of one food source .    in both the cases of equidistant and non - equidistant food sources , a collective state",
    "is reached essentially in the same amount of time as the single food source case ( see figure  [ fig : trans2 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that once foragers find a food source they immediately lay pheromone attracting all other foragers nearby .",
    "the result is single food source behavior until depletion where the foragers carry out a random walk again .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in figure  [ fig : trans2 ] during the time period that the foragers leave the collective phase .",

    "is incorporated via a kinetic model and the simulations are carried out by solving this pde directly , but the entire ant raiding cycle ( e.g. , foraging and returning to the nest ) has not yet been studied .",
    "another simplification used in this work is a homogeneous environment where essentially there are no obstacles or variance in elevation .",
    "some progress has been made toward this in @xcite , but much more is still needed for full understanding .",
    "it would be interesting to include environmental effects and study how the onset of collective dynamics and lane formation would change .",

    "if the environment is rough and movement is hindered ( @xmath29 is small ) or if the environment is flat and homogeneous with little friction , then @xmath29 is closer to the isolated translational speed of an ant .",
    "since the model accounts for interactions between ants in one colony , it is natural to ask what would happen if this model was used for ant communities competing for food resources @xcite or if the effect of predators was investigated @xcite .",
    "the clear next step is to derive the corresponding kinetic theory for the coupled system - for comparison with the various current continuum pde models for the ant density .",
    "there the limit is taken as the number of particles and volume go to infinity , but the concentration @xmath108 is held fixed",

    "the simulations of the model show indeed a sharp transition from individual to collective behavior in both foragers and returners with an explicit time delay accounting for the reaction of the foragers to the chemical gradient .",

    "the case of multiple food sources was investigated revealing distinct behavior depending on the locations of the food sources . also , the critical exponents found herein describe the behavior of the system as a function of system parameters .    through analysis of the model , we acquire further knowledge of social insect behavior . even in the absence of direct communication",

    "this can be explained using insight from the analysis of the model for ants in that an individual takes up a certain amount of space and to avoid a path being inhibited individuals of like orientation naturally follow one another . as in ants ,",
    "the global patterns are not known at the local level , yet still emerge in time .",
    "the main difference between humans and ants is that typically humans behave in a ways that are best for the individual while ants only exist for the good of the colony @xcite .    at present",
    "this work only considers a small number of ants to verify the model .",
    "this allows for figures and simulations where the particles can be distinguished to illustrate individual behavior at the microscopic level .",
    "even with this restriction in mind , this simple model is still able to capture the transition to the collective state and lane formation .",
    "most other works focus on one aspect of the raiding cycle such as laying a chemical trail .",
    "however , our model , like the recent pde model in @xcite , allows for simulation of the entire ant raiding cycle from random foraging , to the identification of a food source , and food depletion .",

    "the behavior of both models is similar , the closest food source is essentially depleted first and then the second food source is visited .",
    "thus , ants will use all available foragers to completely deplete the closer quantity of food before moving on .",
