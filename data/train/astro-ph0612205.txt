    "one of the most important parameter needed for interpretation of air shower measurements is the proton - air cross section @xmath3 , which is not well known at cosmic ray energies .",
    "collider measurements of the proton-(anti)proton cross section have to be extrapolated over a wide energy range to be used in models of nuclear effects to predict the proton - air cross section at ultra high energies . on the other hand",
    ", it might be possible to measure @xmath2 by analyzing extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "the point of first interaction in slant depth @xmath0 follows the exponential distribution @xmath4 the cross section @xmath2 is related to the absorption length @xmath5 as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the mean mass of a target ( air ) particle .",
    "the depth and characteristics of the first interaction of the primary cosmic ray particle with a molecule of the atmosphere determines to a large extent the resulting shower shape .",
    "this implies strong correlations of the first interaction with experimentally observable parameters of the shower .",
    "several air shower experiments have provided measured values of @xmath2 by exploiting correlations of @xmath0 with observables found by using air shower simulations @xcite .",
    "of course , these results depend strongly on the used simulations and especially on the chosen high energy hadronic interaction model @xcite .",
    "the hires collaboration proposed a new technique which appeared to be almost independent of the hadronic interaction model @xcite .",
    "the idea is to decompose the measured distribution of shower maxima @xmath8 into the two independent distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath9 with @xmath10    using the introduced @xmath9 one can express the @xmath1 distribution as folding integral @xmath11 of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 distributions , whereas in the hires @xcite approach @xmath12 is used .",
    "measuring @xmath2 means to deconvolve the @xmath1 distribution using a known @xmath9 distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath9 needs to be inferred from simulations .",
    "to investigate the deconvolution technique , we simulated sets of proton - induced showers of 10  eev using conex @xcite with the high energy interaction models qgsjet01 @xcite , sibyll2.1 @xcite , nexus3 @xcite , and qgsjetii.3 @xcite . in addition helium , cno and gamma - ray primaries were simulated with qgsjet01 .",
    "each set of simulations contains 200.000 events .",
    "one of the important conditions for the applicability of the method proposed in @xcite is the @xmath13-independence of the @xmath9 distribution . for a given model ,",
    "this is indeed the case as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : deltax ] ( left ) .",
    "the universality in @xmath0 has been verified for proton primaries using nexus3 , sibyll2.1 , qgsjetii.3 , and qgsjet01 at 1  eev and 10  eev",
    ".    therefore one can use @xmath14    however , the resulting @xmath9 distribution depends strongly on the hadronic interaction model used for shower simulation ( fig . [",
    "f : deltax ] , right ) .",
    "the maximum of the @xmath9 distribution is shifted by up to 60  g/@xmath15 and the slope beyond the maximum changes by up to a factor of 1.36 .",
    "this introduces a principal model dependence to the deconvolution technique .",
    "it can be tried to reduce this dependence by adding an additional degree of freedom , @xmath16 , which allows the @xmath9 distribution to shift along the x axis @xmath17 it is much more difficult to reduce the model - dependence of the shape of the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "this will not be discussed in this paper but we shall show the impact of this model - dependence on the resulting @xmath2 reconstruction .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for each model , a monte carlo data set of 50.000 events was generated and analyzed with the @xmath9 distributions found previously .",
    "no detector effects are considered .",
    "two free parameters ( @xmath18 and @xmath16 ) are fitted using @xmath19 minimization and @xmath20    the fit results are shown in tab .",
    "[ t : bigtable ] for all combinations of hadronic interaction models and @xmath9 distributions .",
    "the diagonal elements of the table represent matching models for data and @xmath9 . in these cases",
    "the true cross section of the input model can be retrieved very well by the convolution method .",
    "it is interesting that for models with a similar shape of the @xmath9 distribution ( qgsjetii and sibyll ) the reconstruction still works rather well , whereas for combinations of models which have a very different shape of @xmath9 ( qgsjet and nexus ) the results differ up to 200  mb .",
    "the reconstructed value of @xmath2 is very sensitive to the chosen starting point of the fit range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : fittingrange ] ( left ) .",
    "the reason for this is the introduced @xmath16 parameter which needs the peak of the @xmath1 distribution to be restricted . to fit only the slope after",
    "the peak of the @xmath1 distribution is not sufficient if @xmath16 is treated as free parameter .        restricting the end point of the fitting range",
    "mainly increases the statistical uncertainty of the fit result .",
    "the true value of @xmath21 is still within the statistical errors of the reconstructed values ( see fig .  [",
    "f : fittingrange ] , right ) .",
    "if the selected showers do contain a fraction of light elements other than protons , the shape of the measured @xmath1 distribution will be altered .",
    "a possible contribution of helium will mostly distort the region of the peak of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "since the peak of the @xmath1 distribution is important for the fit itself , the reconstruction of @xmath2 is affected ( fig .",
    "[ f : mix ] , top )    contamination with cno showers mainly influences the rising edge of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the impact on the fit result can be limited by shifting the starting point of the fit range more towards the peak of the distribution . using a short fit range , the effect on the reconstruction of @xmath2 can be neglected for small fractions of cno ( fig . [",
    "f : mix ] , middle ) .",
    "gamma - ray primaries produce an @xmath1 distribution which is shifted to higher @xmath1 by about 200  g/@xmath15 with respect to protons . therefore the influence of gamma - ray showers can be reduced by setting the end of the fitting range appropriately ( fig .",
    "[ f : mix ] , bottom ) .",
    "nevertheless already a small contribution of gamma - rays does affect the @xmath1 distribution significantly because of the low number of proton events at high @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noted that even if cosmic ray sources would accelerate only protons , a small fraction of gamma - rays is expected due to the gzk energy loss process @xcite .",
    "the folding integral method would be very powerful given the true @xmath9 distribution is known .",
    "input cross sections can be reconstructed within statistical uncertainties of a few mb .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath9 distribution does depend on the high energy hadronic interaction model used during air shower simulation .",
    "the @xmath9 model dependence can be reduced by adding a new degree of freedom @xmath16 to the fit but it still amounts up to @xmath23  100  mb . on the other hand , treating @xmath16 as free parameter increases the sensitivity of @xmath2 to a possible helium contamination of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "medium mass cosmic ray primaries have only limited influence on the reconstructed @xmath2 .",
    "even a small fraction of gamma - ray primaries has a significant impact on the reconstruction results .      .",
