    "the linear theory of density perturbations shows that a spherically symmetric mass concentration in an expanding universe induces a radial peculiar velocity field in the surrounding region @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average spherical mass overdensity within the radius @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath0 are the hubble constant throughout , where @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 . ] and the cosmological density parameter at the present time , respectively . we can estimate the galaxy number overdensity @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bias parameter .",
    "thus , if we can measure @xmath11 we can estimate @xmath12 .",
    "several authors have applied this method to the local supercluster and to the virgo cluster with mixed results ( see e.g. the review by @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . along with the uncertainties in the determination of the galaxy number overdensity and the peculiar velocity themselves , external",
    "tidal shear can strongly affect the velocity field ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; thus we can not obtain reliable results unless we sample the velocity field within the full three - dimensional region around the cluster ( @xcite ) .    in redshift space ,",
    "spherical infall confines galaxies around clusters within caustics , surfaces with a characteristic `` trumpet '' shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "for these non - linear regions , we must replace the linear regime equation ( [ 1.1 ] ) with the exact solution of the equation of motion of shells in an overdense region within the expanding universe ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , the dependence of the peculiar velocity on @xmath13 and @xmath14 is still approximately separable ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , provided we can determine the location of the caustics , we can still estimate @xmath13 through the measurement of @xmath14 for a rich galaxy cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested the application of gravitational lensing ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to determine the mass overdensity @xmath15 and therefore the unbiased value of @xmath0 .",
    "standard inflationary cosmologies ( e.g. @xcite ) predict that the primordial density field is a gaussian random field .",
    "these initial conditions can lead to either top - down or bottom - up scenarios for the formation of cosmic structures .",
    "the hierarchical clustering in the bottom - up scenarios , with large systems forming by aggregation of smaller ones , currently represents the most successful framework of structure formation theories as it seems to be able to reproduce many , although not all , properties of the real universe .",
    "the top - down scenarios are far less succesfull ( see e.g. @xcite for a general discussion ) .",
    "the general formation process of clusters in hierarchical scenarios differs substantially from the one described by the idealized spherical model ; here clusters form through the infall of smooth spherical shells onto an initial density peak ( @xcite ) . despite its idealized nature",
    ", the spherical model appears to represent a reasonable description of the collapse of high peaks in a random gaussian density field ( @xcite ) , and predicts density and velocity profiles of final systems in reasonably good agreement with @xmath1-body simulations of dark matter halo formation when the power spectrum has an effective spectral index @xmath16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these authors suggest that particle ranks in binding energy are conserved during the formation process .",
    "this conservation is responsible for the agreement ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , for spectral indices @xmath17 the formation process is more violent ( @xcite ) , energy ranks are not conserved , and the agreement breaks down .",
    "thus , the agreement in energy space between the spherical infall model and hierarchical clustering for a limited range of spectral index , @xmath18 , allows correct predictions about the _ final state _ of the halo .",
    "however , the spherical infall model does not describe the _ evolution _ of the outer regions of systems in configuration space .",
    "@xmath1-body simulations of flat universes ( @xcite ; @xcite ) show that the velocity field of cluster surroundings is very different from the predictions of spherical infall because ( 1 ) recent mergers increase the particle kinetic energy , and ( 2 ) the presence of substructures makes the velocity profile irregular .",
    "in other words , random motions obscure the infall information .",
    "if the same problem arises in real galaxy clusters , estimates of @xmath13 ( or @xmath0 ) based on spherical infall are systematic overestimates .    here , we suggest a unifying explanation for the amplitude of the caustics .",
    "we use @xmath1-body simulations of flat and open universes to show that the escape velocity around dark matter halos determines the amplitude of the caustics .",
    "thus , the local dynamics of the halo , not the global properties of the universe , dominates the amplitude of the velocity field around clusters .",
    "we also show that under reasonable hypotheses about the density field outside the virialized region , the velocity field around a cluster provides an estimate of the mass enclosed within a few megaparsecs of the cluster center .",
    "this method is particularly interesting because , in this region , the equilibrium assumptions underlying usual mass estimation methods do not hold .    in sect .",
    "2 we review the main equations of the spherical infall model . in sect .",
    "3 we derive the alternative expression for the amplitude of the caustics and we outline the mass estimation method . in sect .",
    "4 we compare both the expression for the amplitude of the caustics and the spherical infall model with the results of @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "we also use these @xmath1-body simulations to test our new mass estimation method .",
    "we now review the main points of the infall model for a spherical perturbation in the case of open and flat universes .",

    "the evolution of each shell in the absence of shell crossings is described by the equation of motion @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass within @xmath5 , @xmath27 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath28 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the first integral of the equation of motion is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total energy of the shell . in order to consider the collapse independent of the primordial density profile",

    "thus , we may write the collapse time @xmath54 finally , we can write the equation describing the evolution of @xmath55 implicitly @xmath56    in terms of the local scale factor @xmath35 , we next determine the caustics which depend only on the cosmological parameters and not on the overdensity profile .",

    "the peculiar velocity is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the hubble constant at time @xmath69 .",
    "thus , for the velocity difference on the caustics , we have @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the projected physical radius along the line of sight .",

    "however , for fixed @xmath65 the dependence is weak : @xmath123 .",
    "we recover the usual @xmath124 logarithmic dependence , when we switch to physical distances @xmath114 .",
    "in redshift space , the infall regions of halos in @xmath1-body experiments resemble the characteristic trumpet shapes expected in the spherical infall model ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , the amplitude of these caustics , namely the difference between the maximum and minimum line - of - sight velocity at projected distance @xmath114 from the halo center , usually exceeds the amplitude predicted by the model .",
    "the larger amplitude occurs because of random motions in the infall region .    in  3.1",
    ", we derive an expression for the amplitude of the velocity field which takes random motions into account .",
    "this expression indeed replaces the prediction of the spherical infall model .",
    "moreover , this expression suggests a method of estimating the mass enclosed within a distance @xmath114 from the halo center , where @xmath114 extends well beyond the region of virial equilibrium .",
    "we derive this expression in  3.2 . in  4 , we compare both expressions with @xmath1-body simulations of dark matter halos .      consider a dark halo in its center of mass reference frame .",

    "particle motion is mainly random and @xmath134 . for @xmath135 , orbits become more radial and @xmath13 increases up to @xmath136 ( see  4.2.1 ) . within these regions , random motions still contribute significantly to the velocity field , because of the intrinsic stochastic accretion process in hierarchical clustering .",
    "the non - zero @xmath137 at large radii is responsible for the general increase of the amplitude of the caustics relative to pure spherical infall .    in order to write down an expression for the amplitude of the velocity field",
    ", we note that the presence of random motions in the outskirts of the halo implies that encounters can give a particle enough energy to escape the gravitational field of the halo .",
    "thus , if the random motion is significant , we expect that the amplitude of the velocity field at a given distance @xmath5 _ is _ the line - of - sight component of the escape velocity , not the smaller velocity induced solely by spherically symmetric infall .",
    "the escape velocity is @xmath138 : the caustic amplitude is thus a measure of the gravitational potential @xmath139 . for the sake of simplicity , consider a spherical system .",
    "we have @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the total mass within @xmath5 and @xmath142 is the system density profile .",
    "equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) holds regardless of the stability of the system .    in equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) @xmath143 is the full three - dimensional escape velocity .",
    "observations of real clusters will provide only the component @xmath144 of the escape velocity along the line - of - sight at projected distances @xmath114 .",
    "the velocity field within the infall region is not isotropic , as indicated by the large value of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath145 . if the tangential component @xmath146 of the velocity field is isotropic , we have @xmath147 , is a non - increasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior is valid for density profiles steeper than @xmath148 . ] or @xmath149 in  4.2.2 , we will see that equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) indeed describes the amplitude of the velocity field of dark matter halos out to a few times the virial radius , @xmath133 .",
    "we now argue that the measure of the escape velocity along the line of sight , i.e. the measure of the amplitude of the caustics , may provide a method to estimate @xmath141 . in principle ,",
    "knowledge of @xmath143 readily yields an estimate of the mass within @xmath5 from equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) , @xmath150 however , @xmath151 is the product of two functions ( eq . [ [ 3.3 ] ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath152 is unknown , but suppose we can model it .",
    "the only measurable function @xmath153 is likely to be very noisy .",

    ", we integrate the noisy function rather than differentiating it .",
    "we now replace , in equation ( [ 3.6 ] ) , the three - dimensional distance @xmath5 with the projected distance @xmath114 , and the three - dimensional escape velocity @xmath143 with the measurable @xmath144 .",
    "the second replacement implies the introduction of the velocity field anisotropy parameter @xmath13 .",
    "equation ( [ 3.6 ] ) becomes @xmath159 where @xmath160    knowledge of the filling function @xmath161 allows the estimation of the system mass for any @xmath162 .",

    "in fact , the assumption of a spherically symmetric @xmath142 leading to equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) is a very crude approximation at best .",

    ", we will see in  4.2.3 that equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) still holds for reasonable models of @xmath161 . in practice , we can estimate the mass within @xmath133 by applying the virial theorem or by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium of the x - ray emitting gas . outside",
    "@xmath133 these methods break down , and we can use equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "reasonable assumptions about the behavior of @xmath166 and @xmath167 at large radii provide a model for @xmath168 .",

    ", we now show that , for suitable choices of @xmath161 , the method outlined here can lead to remarkably good mass estimates for @xmath1-body systems .",
    "we now use @xmath1-body simulations to illustrate how random motions in the outskirts of dark halos invalidate application of the spherical infall model to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that measurement of the amplitude of the velocity field _ does _ provide a method of obtaining the enclosed mass with better than @xmath2 accuracy for massive halos .      as typical hierarchical clustering scenarios , we consider three cold dark matter ( cdm ) universes with @xmath118=[1.0,0.0],[0.2,0.0],[0.2,0.8]$ ] , and @xmath178 .",
    "initial conditions are generated with the cosmos package developed by e. @xcite which perturbs initial particle positions and velocities from a grid according to the zeldovich approximation .",

    "we integrate the equations of motion with a particle - mesh code ( @xcite , @xcite ) using 128@xmath182 mesh points , a seven - point finite - difference approximation to the laplacian , a cloud - in - cell density assignment , a leap - frog integrator , and an energy conserving scheme to compute the force .",
    "cdm universes have an effective spectral index @xmath190 on cluster scales .",
    "thus , we use the scale factor @xmath22 as the time variable ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also use this variable for the open models , though this choice is actually appropriate only for flat universes .",

    "however , the computed force follows the newtonian value accurately for distances roughly twice the mesh cell size , @xmath196 mpc in our simulations .",
    "our simulations have two main shortcomings : ( 1 ) poor spatial resolution and integration accuracy , and ( 2 ) small box size . despite the first problem",
    ", we will see in the next subsection that for distances larger than the cell size , our halos roughly reproduce the density and velocity fields obtained in simulations with larger dynamical range and higher accuracy ( @xcite ) . at any rate",
    ", we are currently running another set of simulations with the ap@xmath182 m code ( @xcite ) made available by hugh couchman and collaborators ( @xcite ) and we will report on these results in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the second problem , namely the small box size , implies less tractable errors .",
    "first , periodic boundary conditions produce artificial tidal forces from replicas of structures within the simulation box .",
    "the constrained random field clearly aggravates this problem .",
    "artificial tidal forces erroneously increase the random motions in the outskirts of halos ; they thus artificially worsen the prediction of the spherical infall model .",
    "@xcite suggest that box sizes @xmath197 mpc are necessary to provide reliable results on clustering .",
    "however , in @xmath198 mpc box simulations , individual halo dynamics is almost unaffected because the artificial tidal forces are sufficiently suppressed ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we expect tidal fields to be a minor problem in our models .    secondly , we omit contributions from fourier components of the primordial density perturbation field with wavelengths larger than the box size .",
    "thus , we underestimate both the amplitude of clustering and the amplitude of the peculiar velocities .",
    "corrections to the evolved state of the simulation ( @xcite ) or correction during its evolution ( @xcite ) alleviate the problem .",
    "the missing clustering would probably increase the merger rate and therefore the random motion in the outskirts of halos , thus worsening the predictive power of the spherical infall model .",
    "the velocity field is affected mainly in the bulk velocity .",
    "random motions increase by only a few percent when one increases the size of the box from 100 to 800 mpc ( @xcite ) .    in summary",
    ", we increase the random motions because of poor spatial resolution and integration accuracy , but we decrease it because of missing large - scale power .",
    "we plan further work to investigate how these problems affect our results .",
    "we now describe the results of our simulations .",
    "first , we consider the density and velocity fields of the most massive halos (  4.2.1 ) . in  4.2.2 , we examine the velocity field within the infall regions .",
    "we compare the simulations with the mass estimation method in  4.2.3 .",
    "we identify halos using a generalization of the friends - of - friends algorithm ( @xcite ) with a linking length equal to 0.1 mpc @xmath199 times the interparticle distance , and a critical number of neighbor particles @xmath200 ( @xmath201 yields the classical friends - of - friends algorithm ) .",
    "these parameters assure a halo overdensity @xmath202 with respect to the background . however , this point is of secondary importance ; we are interested only in the determination of the center of mass of the halo in order to study the velocity field of the outer regions .",
    "linking lengths between 0.08 and 0.16 mpc move the center of mass of the most massive halos less than 1% .",
    "the center of mass velocity suffers larger oscillations .",
    "however , to suppress this problem we redefine the cluster velocity from all the particles within the virial radius @xmath133 defined below .    in the outskirts of halos ,",
    "halo asphericities have little effect on particle velocities , because equipotential surfaces are rounder than equidensity surfaces .",
    "for example , van haarlem et al .",
    "( 1993 ) find that at distances larger than a few megaparsecs from the halo center , the force difference between a spherical distribution and a significantly ellipsoidal distribution is @xmath203% .",
    "these authors also show that asphericities can blur the caustics expected in the infall model . however , the disagreement between the spherical infall model and the simulations is more severe than the departures induced by asphericity ( see @xcite ) .",

    "5 shows the halo mass estimated with equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) when we integrate from @xmath257 .",
    "it is remarkable that @xmath246 still works reasonably well for @xmath163 when the clusters are relaxed ( lower row ) , showing that the filling function @xmath246 is more robust than @xmath247 .",
    "we expect this result ; when @xmath163 our hypotheses leading to @xmath247 break down .",
    "when the clusters are unrelaxed ( upper row ) the estimation method introduces large errors .",
    "these results imply only that both filling functions are inadequate ; the velocity field is still well described by the escape velocity ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    fig .",
    "6 shows how our mass estimator behaves statistically . for each model , we separate the most massive from the least massive halos , regardless of their dynamical state . for the flat universe , we consider halos with @xmath258 and @xmath259 . for the open universes ,",
    "we consider halos with @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",

    "the method yields better estimates for more massive halos ( upper row ) .",
    "the agreement for less massive halos worsens because tidal fields caused by neighboring larger halos severely perturb the velocity fields of the smaller halos .",
    "however , these small halos contain only a few thousand particles within @xmath263 a few times the cell size .",
    "thus , numerical artifacts may also play a significant role .",
    "6 shows that our method of estimating the mass of _ non - virialized _ regions yields better than @xmath264% statistical accuracy for halos with virial mass @xmath265 . for comparison , consider the accuracy of x - ray estimates of the mass of _ virialized _ halos .",
    "@xmath1-body / hydrodynamics simulations show that the assumption of an isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium yields virial masses with better than @xmath266% accuracy ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we note however that gravitational lensing methods , which do not require equilibrium assumptions , may disagree with x - ray observations .",
    "for example , @xcite claim that x - ray observations may actually underestimate the mass of real clusters by a factor of @xmath267 .",
    "however , gravitational lensing methods suffer systematic errors due to non - spherical symmetry , projection effects , and substructure ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , there are examples where x - ray mass estimates do agree with weak lensing estimates to within the error limits ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) . we conclude that when applied to @xmath1-body systems our mass estimation method has an accuracy comparable with other widely used methods .",
    "application of our method to real clusters introduces non - trivial challanges .",
    "first , we do not know how reliably galaxies trace the velocity field in these non - linear regions .",
    "secondly , sampling effects may introduce large errors , though these effects can be quantified .",
    "even if we could overcome these problems , it is not clear how reliably we can determine the amplitude of the velocity fields in cluster infall regions ; the caustics may not be very apparent ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to investigate these issues in future work .",
    "in redshift space , galaxies around clusters should appear within regions with a characteristic trumpet shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "regs & geller ( 1989 ) suggested applying the spherical infall model to these caustics to constrain the density of the universe .",
    "we show that this method generally overestimates the actual density parameter @xmath0 because random motions increase the amplitude of the caustics ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we define the amplitude of the velocity field as half of the difference between the maximum and minimum line - of - sight velocity at projected distance @xmath114 from the cluster center .",
    "we use @xmath1-body simulations to show that the escape velocity ( eqs .",
    "[ [ 3.2 ] ] , and [ [ 4.4 ] ] ) describes this amplitude well , with @xmath114 ranging over two orders of magnitude , from the central region of the halo to its infall regions , where particle orbits are mainly radial .",
    "van haarlem ( 1992 ) first noted that the spherical infall method overestimates @xmath0 and pointed out that mergers and substructures within the infall regions are responsible for the disagreement .",
    "here we suggest a unifying explanation .",
    "we show that our interpretation of the amplitude of the velocity field within halo infall regions can be applied to estimate the interior mass of halos up to a few virial radii @xmath133 from the halo center , where the usual equilibrium assumptions do not hold .",
    "this estimation technique works because the local dynamics depends more strongly on the mass of the halo than on the global properties of the universe .",
    "this deduction agrees with the recent suggestion by white ( 1996 ) and @xcite that halos have a universal density profile , basically independent of the cosmology , with a characteristic density depending on the formation time of the halo ( see also our eq . [ [ 4.2 ] ] ) which ultimately depends on the halo mass . in the literature ,",
    "the dependence of the density profile on the halo mass has been neglected , with attention focused on the dependence on @xmath0 and on the power spectrum @xmath268 .",
    "the limited overdensity range examined in these numerical studies explains why @xmath1-body simulations appear to show a dependence of the halo density profile on the underlying cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if we know the mass @xmath243 within the virial radius @xmath133 our mass estimation method can estimate the mass up to several @xmath133 with a @xmath269 uncertainty on average , at least for halos with mass @xmath270 .",
    "if cluster galaxies are unbiased tracers of the gravitational potential , we can estimate the mass within the outskirts of observed systems on the basis of redshift data alone .",
    "however , we must investigate how sampling affects the result , and we must explore how accurately we need to know the mass within the virial radius .",
    "last but not least , we must find a reliable method of determining the caustics and extracting the escape velocity function @xmath271 .",
    "this problem is not trivial because the caustics may not be obvious ( e.g. @xcite ) , although they do appear in some cases ( see e.g. a3266 in @xcite , and the coma cluster in the 15r survey of @xcite ) . on the theoretical side ,",
    "we need a reasonable assumption for the filling function @xmath161 that we can calibrate with @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "it is reassuring that the simplest assumption we investigate here , @xmath272 , works reasonably well .",
    "we plan to pursue this approach by acquiring dense redshift samples in the infall regions of nearby rich galaxy clusters in order to estimate masses on scales @xmath273 mpc , where linear theory breaks down and where galaxy systems are not yet in virial equilibrium .",
