    "planet formation is believed to involve accretion from the surrounding disk of material .",
    "we consider this gas accretion onto a planet .",
    "a non - keplerian flow pattern develops near the planet .",
    "furthermore , the planet is subject to gravitational torques due to its interaction with the gas disk which result in planetary migration .",
    "we have extended the 2d simulations by lubow , seibert , and artymowicz ( 1999 ) to 3d , in order to analyze these effects more realistically .",
    "we expect 3d effects to be important for planet masses below @xmath0m@xmath1 , since the hill sphere radius becomes smaller than the disk thickness .",
    "the calculations were performed by using the 3d , spherical version of the zeus finite - difference code ( stone et al .",
    "the disk model is similar to that of lubow et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , except that we include the third dimension .",
    "the disk is locally isothermal with @xmath2 , and disk thickness ratio @xmath3 .",
    "the initial surface density is taken to be @xmath4 away from the planet .",
    "the total disk mass is assumed to be 0.0075 solar masses in the radial interval from 1.6 to 21 au .",
    "the planet s orbital radius is taken to be 5.2 au .",
    "thus , the surface density of the unperturbed disk at the planet s orbital radius is 75 g @xmath5 .",
    "we apply a constant kinematic viscosity @xmath6 which , at the planet s radius , corresponds to viscosity parameter @xmath7 .",
    "we adopt a grid @xmath8 that is non - uniform in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the highest resolution is achieved close to the planet .",
    "zones near the planet measure 0.002875 in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and twice this value in @xmath11 .",
    "we model 4 vertical scale heights above the midplane .",
    "we consider separately planets of masses 1 , 0.1 , 0.03 , 0.01 , and 0.003 m@xmath1 which orbit about a 1 @xmath12 star .",
    "the latter planet mass corresponds to 1 earth mass . in all cases ,",
    "the flow is resolved within the planet s hill sphere .",
    "the planet - disk interaction modifies the disk in the vicinity of the planet ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in fig .  2 , we plot the azimuthally - averaged disk surface density .",
    "only a 1@xmath13 planet opens a deep gap and a mass of at least 0.1@xmath13 is required for the surface density to be perturbed significantly .",
    "lower mass planets result in much less severe surface - density perturbations .",
    "in fig .  3 , left panel , we plot the migration rates of the 5 planets . we find that the migration rate increases linearly with planet mass , as expected for type i migration where the planet does not open a gap in the disk .",
    "we also plot the migration rates expected from the linear theories of ward ( 1997 ) and tanaka et al .",
    "ward s calculations approximate the disk as two - dimensional and do not include co - rotation resonances .",
    "tanaka et al .",
    "consider three - dimensional disks and both lindblad and co - rotation resonances .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with tanaka et al .  for @xmath14 jupiter masses ( i.e.  in the type i regime ) .",
    "in fig .  3 , right panel , we plot the accretion rates onto the planet against planet mass for the 5 planets ( filled circles ) . also plotted are the rates obtained for higher mass planets from the two - dimensional calculations of lubow et al ( 1999 ) .",
    "* the migration rate scales linearly with @xmath15 for planets that do not open a gap .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the linear analysis of tanaka et al .",
    "planets with masses @xmath16 m@xmath1 migrate on the disc s viscous timescale . * the mass accretion rate increases linearly with planet mass @xmath15 for low - mass planets and peaks at @xmath17 m@xmath1 . at higher masses ,",
    "the mass accretion rate declines as a gap is opened in this disk ."
