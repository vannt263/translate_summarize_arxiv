    "networks in a variety of natural settings are currently the subject of intense enquiry and span a variety of disciplines , ranging from biology @xcite , ecology @xcite , engineering @xcite to social interactions @xcite .",
    "the manner in which such networks arise , given the diversity of settings in which these are observed , is an additional issue .",
    "the idea that such structures are in some sense inevitable once a set of simple rules and interactions is specified , namely that there is `` self  organization '' at work has been a theme that has also been studied in diverse settings @xcite .",
    "the neural network structure  the nature and significance of the interactions and connections in neuronal systems  has long been recognized and has been an area of study for several decades .",
    "there has been extensive work on the dynamical properties of neural networks , in particular those that emerge as a result of evolving connection strengths @xcite , the response to external stimuli @xcite , and the interplay between topology and intrinsic nodal dynamics @xcite .",
    "a specific question is on how the response of a sensory system to external stimuli is optimized @xcite , particularly in the context of information processing @xcite and whether the self ",
    "organized network is essential to this feature .",
    "when a neural network is in a critical state , the avalanches of spiking activity @xcite are critical , namely they are characterized by power ",
    "law distributions , and the role of network topology @xcite appears to be limited .",
    "studies of avalanche dynamics have been both theoretical @xcite and experimental : for instance , it has been suggested that the propagation of spontaneous activity recorded from the rat cortex can be described in terms of critical avalanches with an event  size exponent of 3/2 @xcite .",
    "how does the global dynamics of such networks change when the nature of the interaction is altered ?",
    "this question is explored here through the use of both analytic and numerical tools and is the main focus of the present work .",
    "similar issues have been examined in other recent works @xcite although the geometry of the model and the dynamics differ significantly from the present case . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the system studied here .",
    "this builds upon the model introduced earlier by kinouchi and copelli ( kc ) @xcite by introducing stochasticity in the deexcitation process : excited neurons return to the silent state with some probability , reflecting the inherently stochastic nature of cellular and subcellular dynamics . in concordance with earlier work @xcite",
    "there is a non - equilibrium phase transition , and here we determine the critical dynamics by computing the lyapunov exponent .",
    "these results are presented in section iii , and this is followed by a study of the avalanches of neuronal activity in section iv .",
    "a mean  field theory for the stochastic transition and a general methodology relating the scaling exponents are also given .",
    "the final section v summarizes our results .",
    "the neuronal cellular automaton model introduced by kinouchi and copelli is a quenched rnyi network of excitable elements @xcite .",
    "nodes in the network can be in one of @xmath0 states : 0 ( silent ) , 1 ( excited or active ) or @xmath1 refractory states ( which are denoted @xmath2 for convenience ) . the dynamics results from the following three processes :    1 .",
    "external driving or noise as a stimulus can cause a silent node to become active .",
    "this 0@xmath31 transition occurs at each time step with probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the stimulus rate .",
    "2 .   at each time step",
    ", a silent node @xmath6 is excited ( namely 0@xmath31 ) if it receives a stimulus from one of its active neighbors @xmath7 .",
    "this can occur with probability @xmath8 , the weight of the connection .",
    "3 .   spontaneous transitions that can be of two kinds ,",
    "namely , an excited state becomes refractory ( 1@xmath9 ) with unit probability and further , a node in state @xmath10 moves to @xmath11 if @xmath12 , also with unit probability .",
    "network response @xmath13 is calculated by the density of active sites @xmath14 averaged over a time window @xmath15 .",
    "measure of fluctuations in @xmath13 is the susceptibility @xmath16 , while the spontaneous activity at @xmath17 = 0 is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "this nonequilibrium system undergoes a continuous phase transition from a moving phase ( corresponding to sustained neuronal activity ) to an absorbing phase ( where all nodes are in silent state ) as a function of the average branching ratio @xcite . for every node in the network ,",
    "the branching ratio gives the average number of excitations created by that element at the subsequent time step .",
    "similar interactions have been used to model epidemics on contact networks @xcite .",
    "the relationship between criticality and network structure is crucial , since the response of this network to external stimuli  and hence the dynamical range  is optimal when the spontaneous activity of the network is critical @xcite .",
    "however , in a generalization of the kc model that accounts for the integration of excitatory inputs @xcite , the order of the phase transition itself appears to change : the transition becomes discontinuous and results in bistability in the system , with a history ",
    "dependent dynamical range apparently being optimized in this bistable regime .",
    "the largest eigenvalue @xmath19 of the network connectivity matrix is the `` universal '' control parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the connectivity matrix is symmetric with nonzero elements all equal ( namely all connections have equal weights ) then @xmath19 is proportional to the average degree of the network @xcite .",
    "we study a variation on the kc model on a two  dimensional square lattice using both the nearest neighbor ( namely von neumann ) as well as the moore connectivity .",
    "for simplicity we take @xmath0 = 2 ; nodes can be either silent or excited .",
    "further , the external stimulus is absent , namely @xmath17 = 0 .",
    "based on the electrophysiological differences , neurons can be broadly categorised as bursting or spiking . considering a neuron as a discrete dynamical unit ,",
    "excited state for a single time step characterizes the spiking behaviour whereas multiple consecutive spikes of a bursting neuron preceding a refractory period are mimicked by a prolonged active state lasting several time steps @xcite . to account for both these behaviours in the present network , the transition from the active to the silent state ( cf .",
    "process 3 in the above dynamics ) is considered as a stochastic process .",
    "this transition is taken to occur with probability @xmath20 $ ] , @xmath21 = 0 being the `` zero  temperature '' limit , while @xmath22 1 corresponding to the case studied earlier by kc for a spiking neuron .",
    "the elements of the symmetric connectivity matrix , the @xmath8 s , are drawn from an uniform distribution in @xmath23 $ ] , and we rescale the largest eigenvalue @xmath19 of this matrix appropriately to use as a control parameter @xcite .",
    "this rescaling is done in a way that the largest eigenvalue of the new adjacency matrix lies between 0 and 2 with @xmath19 = 1 being the critical point .",
    "the elements of this matrix are kept fixed throughout the simulation implying quenched disorder .",
    "we choose to use @xmath19 as the control parameter to further extend our work to the study of real networks with heterogeneous degree distributions where the branching ratio fails to predict criticality @xcite .",
    "also , with the use of @xmath19 as the control parameter , our calculations become independent of the system size .",
    "in the limit @xmath24 1 , the present model reduces to that studied by kc . in order to further characterize the critical dynamics we compute the boolean lyapunov exponent @xcite @xmath25 by coevolving two initial network configurations and examining the average variation of the hamming distance as a function of time . the boolean lyapunov exponent is given as = _",
    "i=1^n_2 , [ lyap ] where @xmath26 is the number of sample ( random ) perturbations considered , @xmath27 is the number of time steps , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the initial and final hamming distances . sufficiently large @xmath27 and @xmath26 need to be taken for reliable results .",
    "other definitions of the boolean lyapunov exponents have also been extensively used earlier to characterise the dynamics of cellular  automata models @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with a critical point at @xmath19 = 1 for @xmath21 = 1 ; nearby trajectories converged for sub ",
    "critical networks , namely @xmath30 for @xmath31 while the dynamics is chaotic in the super  critical networks : @xmath32 for @xmath33 . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) are the numerical results at this value of @xmath21 showing that both @xmath25 and @xmath19 - 1 cross the axis at the same point .",
    "for @xmath34 1 , however , we find that the critical point is no longer at @xmath19 = 1 and is instead shifted by an amount proportional to @xmath21 . the change in the sign of the boolean lyapunov exponent , the phase transition in @xmath18 , and the optimization of the susceptibility shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a)(c ) respectively ; all three indicators clearly show a shift in the critical point for different values of @xmath21 .",
    "similar results are obtained for @xmath35 ; wherein a node in state 1 ( excited ) goes to state @xmath36 ( refractory ) with a probability @xmath21 and its subsequent updates till it reaches the state 0 ( silent ) are deterministic ; an extended period of refractoriness does not affect the critical point @xcite in the present setting . in 1d ( namely @xmath37 = 2 ) , the system does not show a phase transition at @xmath21 = 1 for a 3 state model ( @xmath0 = 3 ) but for @xmath38 , the phase transition is recovered @xcite .",
    "we confirm the linear variation of the critical value , namely @xmath39 both numerically and analytically using mean  field analysis . in the kc model",
    "the transition from the silent to the active state ( namely 0 @xmath3 1 ) can take place in two ways : ( i ) through an external stimulus , and ( ii ) via active neighbor interactions . on a two dimensional square lattice ,",
    "the degree distribution is @xmath40 , where @xmath37 denotes degree of each node .",

    "if @xmath46 denotes the configuration probability of active nodes and @xmath47 that of silent nodes , the corresponding master equation is p_1(t+1 ) = p_0(t ) + ( 1-)p_tp_0(t ) + ( 1-)p_1(t ) . denoting @xmath48",

    "we get _ c , and f ( ) , where the constant @xmath54 . therefore , since @xmath55 scales as @xmath56 , we get @xmath57 = 1 , although the numerical results ( @xmath58 = 0.499 @xmath59 0.002 ) are not in good agreement with this estimate .    at the critical point @xmath60 and with external stimulus @xmath17 ,",
    "the resulting behaviour is f(r ) [ fr ] where @xmath61 is an arbitrary constant .",

    "@xmath53 , we find that the susceptibility varies as ~ , namely the scaling @xmath65 ( @xmath66 0 ) and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 0 ) with @xmath69 = 1 .",
    "numerically , however , we find @xmath70 = 0.89 @xmath59 0.04 , @xmath71 = 1.15 @xmath59 0.04 .",
    "a pertinent observable that has been introduced for such excitable systems is the dynamic range = 10_10 , [ dr ] where the external stimulus @xmath72 leads to response @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 measures the range of stimuli that can be discerned by the changes in the network response @xmath13 .",
    "previous studies have reported that the dynamic range attains its maximum value @xmath75 at the critical point of the system @xcite . with the addition of stochasticity",

    "the mean  field exponents obtained so far are @xmath57 = 1 , @xmath76 = 1 , and @xmath77 = 2 .",
    "now , we consider the cluster size probability distribution which obeys @xmath78 ( for details refer section [ app1 ] ) . below the critical point ,",
    "the cutoff cluster size is related to correlation length @xmath79 as @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the control parameter and @xmath82 is the fractal dimension of cluster .",

    "using the known values of @xmath77 and @xmath76 , it is a simple matter to get @xmath93 = 5/2 , @xmath94 = 1/2 , and @xmath95 = -1 .",
    "if we assume that the avalanche dynamics on the network is diffusion like @xcite , then since the size of the largest cluster is limited by the linear system size @xmath96 , any perturbation at the critical point takes an average @xmath97 steps to diffuse away .",
    "so , from the stationarity condition we get , @xmath98 = 2 , resulting in @xmath99 = 1/2 @xcite and @xmath82 = 4 . using the hyperscaling relation",
    "@xmath100 we get @xmath101 = 6 @xcite as the upper critical dimension .",
    "starting with a null configuration ( all nodes are in state 0 ) we select a site at random and make it active .",
    "this random flipping induces activity in the neighborhood which may then propagate , but this will eventually die out so that the system returns to the null configuration .",
    "this entire event constitutes an avalanche and the total activity at each time step is the avalanche signal @xmath102 . if @xmath15 is the total time , then the total activity during this event s=_t=0^t s(t ) , is the avalanche size @xmath103 .",

    "the various exponents are , of course , related . if @xmath109 are a pair of the above variables and if @xmath110 , where @xmath111 denotes the average value , then there is a simple relation among the exponents @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , _ x = 1 - .",

    "recent efforts to understand the operation of neuronal systems have examined a number of models wherein the feature of self  organization is important . this would be one way of understanding the emergence of complexity in the context of neuroscience .",
    "although automaton models are by their very nature caricatures of how a biological neuron operates , they capture some of the essential features .",
    "furthermore , the manner in which neuronal communication operates can also be modeled within the framework of coupled automata .",
    "here we investigated the automaton model introduced by kinouchi and copelli @xcite .",
    "while it is known that the critical point of this model is invariant under the change of topology @xcite , we alter the nodal dynamics of the kc model and consider its impact on criticality .",
    "other recent studies have also discussed the effect of these variations in a different context @xcite , underscoring the considerable current interest in such problems .",
    "we incorporate additional stochasticity in the deexcitation transition from the active to the silent state and the primary effect of this is to shift the point of criticality without destroying it .",
    "this extended model thus retains the main features of criticality and emergence .",
    "although the effect of having a variable number of refractory states on the critical point in the kc model has been investigated @xcite , in the present case , the dynamics tends to hold the neuron in the excited state for a longer duration thus taking into account the bursting nature as well .",
    "furthermore , owing to the inherent stochasticity in the intrinsic dynamics of a neuron , the duration of bursts may also differ ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , experiments suggest that there exists variability in the burst durations @xcite .",
    "activity in the network is characterized through avalanches , namely sets of firing nodes that are connected spatially and temporally .",
    "probability distributions for a variety of quantities that quantify the avalanches can be described through a set of exponents which we have computed in a two dimensional realization of this model .",
    "we also developed a mean  field model for the dynamics , and show that at the critical point the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions , and further , with the exponents obtained for branching processes @xcite .",
    "the kc model established a theoretical framework for the optimization of dynamical range at criticality , and this has been subsequently verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "it would also be of interest to see if optimization of susceptibility can also be demonstrated experimentally in such models .",
