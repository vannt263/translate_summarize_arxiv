    "remarkably , when a thin film of laalo@xmath0 was deposited on srtio@xmath0 , the interface was found to exhibit unusual phenomena such as a conducting two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with high mobility  @xcite , superconducting @xcite and in some cases magnetic properties  @xcite , and two - dimensional co - existence of both superconducting and magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fundamental phenomenon that has generated a lot of interests is the laalo@xmath0-thickness - dependent insulator - metal transition of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface .",
    "this phenomenon has several peculiar characteristics as shown by the various experimental observations summarized in table i.    recent high - energy reflectivity measurements have shown that in conducting laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 , a charge transfer of 0.5@xmath4 from laalo@xmath0 into laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface and oxygen vacancies have been observed @xcite . while in insulating laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 , an intra - layer charge redistribution within the laalo@xmath0 film has been found .",

    "first , they did not explain the experimentally observed large discontinuity in the interface charge density as laalo@xmath0 thickness increases above 4 unit cells ( uc ) , but instead such calculations predicted this discontinuity only as a very gradual change .",
    "second , the classical electronic reconstruction model and previous computational results would expect the surface of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 to also be metallic , which could strongly disrupt any conclusion drawn from transport and high - energy optical conductivity measurements regarding the interface charge density .",

    "we note that the phenomenon of electronic reconstruction was introduced in earlier study of polar surfaces in k@xmath19c@xmath20 @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we compare the charge density distribution between relaxed and unrelaxed stoichiometric 2 uc laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 structures and the internal charge redistribution between laalo@xmath0 sub - layers is indeed found in our calculations . because of the lattice distortions , the la atoms move upwards to the surface while the oxygen atoms in alo@xmath1 sub - layers move downwards to the interface ( the la - o buckling dipole ) , making their orbitals more overlapped and thus more covalent than in the structures without lattice distortions .",
    "although the overlap between al atoms in alo@xmath1 sub - layers and the oxygen atoms in lao sub - layers ( the al - o buckling dipole ) counteracts the charge redistribution caused by the la - o buckling dipole , this effect is inferior due to the less pronounced lattice distortions of o - al - o chains than the o - la - o chains .",

    "_ v__@xmath24 with the reconstruction model for polar crystal terminations , as discussed below .    in the conventional electronic reconstruction model  @xcite , without allowing for _ _ v__@xmath24 or the internal lattice distortions described above , the charge of 0.5e@xmath23 at the interface is compensated by 0.5 holes in the mainly o-2@xmath29 band of the alo@xmath2-terminated surface of laalo@xmath0 . in this model",
    "not allowing for lattice distortions or other deviations the electronic reconstruction would occur immediately after even only one layer of laalo@xmath0 was deposited ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ) , contrary with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "even more importantly , both the srtio@xmath0 interface layer and the top alo@xmath2 surface layer would become metallic . allowing for the lattice distortions , as shown in fig .",

    "v__@xmath24 , however , approaches zero at 4 uc of laalo@xmath0 ( fig .",

    "based on these results , our model can naturally explain the laalo@xmath0-thickness - dependent discontinuous transition at 4 uc laalo@xmath0 of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 .",
    "below 4 uc of laalo@xmath0 , the internal polarization potential in laalo@xmath0 is compensated by the lattice distortions of laalo@xmath0 film without electronic reconstruction into the interface accompanied by the intra - layer charge redistribution within the laalo@xmath0 film , resulting in insulating laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 . above 4",

    "furthermore , we can classify three types of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 samples based on different experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "first , when the laalo@xmath0 film is deposited on srtio@xmath0 with moderate oxygen partial pressure , surface _ _ v__@xmath24 forms , which leads to the insulator to metal behavior of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 described in fig .  [ fig4]c .",
    "second , when this laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 is post - annealed in high oxygen pressure , the experimentally - observed conductivity decreases , but is not completely gone @xcite .",
    "based on our model , this suggests that the oxygen annealing removes some of the surface _ _ v__@xmath24 , leading to the insulator - metal transition behavior of stoichiometric laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 described in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a with its much lower interface charge density .",
    "third , when laalo@xmath0 is deposited with very low oxygen pressure , it is experimentally observed that the conduction region of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 extends up to 500 @xmath31 m @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the low oxygen pressure condition generates a high number of _ _ v__@xmath24 in srtio@xmath0 ( instead of surface laalo@xmath0 ) , giving rise to three - dimensional electron gas at the interface @xcite .    in conclusion",

    "<S> the mechanism responsible for the extraordinary interface conductivity of laalo@xmath0 on srtio@xmath0 and its insulator - metal transition remains controversial . here , </S>",
    "<S> using density functional theory calculations , we establish a comprehensive and coherent picture that the interplay of electronic reconstructions , lattice distortions , and surface oxygen vacancies fully compensates the polarization potential divergence in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 , explaining naturally the experimental observations under different conditions . </S>",
    "<S> while lattice distortions and a charge redistribution between lao and alo@xmath1 sub - layers play a dominant role in insulating state , a spontaneous appearance of 1/4 oxygen vacancies per alo@xmath2 sub - layer at the laalo@xmath0 surface accompanied by 0.5@xmath3 charge - transfer into the interface is responsible for interface conductivity and the discontinuous transition in laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our model also explain properties of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 prepared with different growth conditions . </S>"
