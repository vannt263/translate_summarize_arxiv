    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism  @xcite is a self - consistent , effective theory approach to qcd interactions at high energy ( or equivalently small @xmath4 ) . even though it is a weak coupling approach , it is different from the collinear factorization based approach of pqcd in two important aspects ; first , it re - sums quantum corrections which are enhanced by large logarithms of @xmath5 as opposed to large logarithms of @xmath6 in pqcd and second , it includes high gluon density effects which are important at small @xmath4 and/or for large nuclei where the physics of gluon saturation may be the dominant .",
    "the cgc formalism has successfully been applied to many qcd processes , from fully inclusive ones such as structure functions in dis to single and double inclusive particle production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at high energy , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the cgc formalism has been also quite successful in providing predictions for particle multiplicities at the lhc @xcite and may provide a first - principle way of understanding of isotropization and thermalization of qcd matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions at rhic and the lhc @xcite .",
    "the observed suppression of single inclusive hadron production and the disappearance of the away side peak in double hadron production in the forward rapidity region of deuteron - nucleus ( da ) collisions at rhic  @xcite are perhaps the strongest evidence for the importance and possibly dominance of saturation effects at rhic .",
    "this will soon be further tested at the lhc where one will be able to probe cgc dynamics in a much larger kinematic region due to the larger energy of the collisions at the lhc .",
    "single inclusive hadron production in proton - nucleus ( pa ) collisions at rhic and the lhc has been investigated by many authors  @xcite in the cgc formalism using varying degrees of approximations and models ( for an alternative description , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the most important ingredient of the single inclusive hadron production cross section which captures the saturation dynamics is the fundamental ( or adjoint ) dipole cross section , the imaginary part of the quark anti - quark scattering amplitude on a proton or nucleus target .",
    "this dipole cross section satisfies the jimwlk / bk evolution equations  @xcite and re - sums the small @xmath4 as well as high gluon density effects . the evolution equation for the dipole cross section is now known with next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) accuracy  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are two distinct but related approaches to hadron production in high energy asymmetric ( such as proton - nucleus or very forward proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus ) collisions .",
    "one is the well - known @xmath7 factorized approach @xcite where partons in both the projectile and target are assumed to be at very small @xmath4 ( @xmath8 ) so that the cgc formalism is applicable to both the projectile and target .",
    "this approach is valid as long as one stays away from the projectile fragmentation region .",
    "an alternative approach was developed in  @xcite where one treats the projectile wave - function perturbatively , i. e. using the standard dglap picture while treating the target by cgc methods .",
    "this approach is better suited for the projectile fragmentation region .",
    "very recently this approach has been improved by keeping the inelastic pieces of the cross section which may be important at high transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "here we numerically investigate the contribution of theses inelastic contributions to single inclusive hadron production in proton - nucleus and proton - proton collisions at rhic and the lhc and show that inclusion of these terms improves the high @xmath1 behavior of the cross section .",
    "the nuclear modification factor is also shown to increase faster with increasing @xmath1 than the case where these inelastic contributions are ignored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce our formalism for the inclusive hadron production in pa collisions , namely the hybrid formulation which includes both elastic and inelastic contributions , supplemented with the running - coupling balitsky - kovchegov equation .",
    "section iii is devoted to comparison with the experimental data and to a discussion of various predictions for the lhc energies .",
    "we conclude in sec . iv .",

    "the longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath17 and @xmath18 are defined as follows @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the collision energy per nucleon . here",
    "we neglect hadron masses since we are only interested in light hadron production at high-@xmath1 ( thereby rapidity and pseudo - rapidity are equal ) .",
    "it is perhaps useful to remind the reader of the derivation of eq .",

    "the first line of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) was first derived in ref .",
    "the result of @xcite has been recently improved in @xcite by keeping the inelastic pieces which lead to the second line in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to consider the effect of this new term in the inclusive hadron production at both rhic and the lhc .",
    "let us first focus on the first line of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) , the dhj term @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for technical details and just outline the derivation of the dhj term .",
    "one starts by calculating two particle production cross section in proton - nucleus scattering .",
    "the simplest process is when a quark from the projectile scatters on the target and radiates a gluon either before or after the scattering ( see fig .",
    "( 12 ) in  @xcite ) .",
    "the incoming quark as well as the outgoing quark and the radiated gluon can all multiply scatter on the target . however , if one is interested in single inclusive production , one needs to integrate over one of the final state partons .",
    "some of the feynman diagrams will have collinear divergences whereas others do not .",
    "there is a collinear divergence in the final state which happens when the outgoing quark and the radiated gluon are nearly parallel and only the initial state quark multiply scatters on the target .",
    "this divergent term is absorbed into quark - hadron fragmentation function and lead to its evolution with @xmath6 according to the lo dglap evolution equation .",
    "the finite ( non - collinear divergent ) pieces are ignored as they are part of the nlo corrections .",
    "there is also a collinear divergence in the initial state which happens when the incoming quark and the radiated gluon are nearly parallel and only the final state quark multiply scatters on the target .",
    "this sort of collinear divergence is absorbed into the incoming parton distribution function and leads to its evolution according to the standard dglap evolution equation .",
    "again , the finite parts of these terms were ignored in  @xcite since they correspond to higher order ( in @xmath21 ) corrections .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the finite pieces which are ignored in @xcite may be important at high @xmath1 and therefore can lead to a modification of the production cross section . keeping the finite diagrams ( which do not have a collinear divergence ) and making the high @xmath1 approximation ( gradient expansion of the quadrupole cross section ) leads to eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) . while the above argument is for an incoming quark scattering on the target , inclusion of other processes such as an incoming gluon scattering on the target",
    "is straightforward  @xcite where a similar analysis of the collinear divergences can be made .    now that the origin of these inelastic terms is made more clear , we comment on the relative significance of the two contributions . the first piece of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) , dubbed the elastic part , corresponds to an incoming parton in the proton wave function scattering elastically on the target .",
    "this incoming parton initially has zero transverse momentum but picks up transverse momentum of order @xmath22 after multiply scattering on the target",
    ". this term should be most important when the transverse momentum of the produced hadron is of order @xmath22 or perhaps even a bit larger . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) , dubbed the inelastic piece , corresponds to a high transverse momentum parton radiated from the incoming parton in the projectile wave function .",
    "this radiated parton is already at high transverse momentum and interacts with the target only once ( higher number of scatterings will be power suppressed ) .",
    "this term is therefore important only when the produced hadron is at transverse momenta much higher that the saturation scale of the target @xmath22 .    in eq .",

    ", we will also examine whether a universal description of various low - x data can be achieved by the rcbk evolution equation .    in order to facilitate a comparison of the solution to rcbk dipole evolution equation",
    ", we also employ the dhj dipole parametrization  @xcite for @xmath54 which has been used to describe the forward rapidity data in dau collisions at rhic .",

    "is taken to be @xmath105 .",

    "the theoretical error bars in show the uncertainties mainly associated with the choice of @xmath21 in .",
    "the observed suppression of @xmath0 at midrapidity and high @xmath1 for the case of lower initial nuclear saturation scale @xmath108 is larger compared to the results obtained within the gluon saturation approach with quasi - classical ( glauber ) approximation @xcite .",
    "we note that there are large uncertainties in @xmath0 in midrapidity at the lhc due to the choice of the initial saturation scale for the rcbk evolution equation ( [ bk1 ] ) , and the value of strong - coupling constant in .",
    "more importantly , large sensitivity of @xmath0 to the value of @xmath21 in in midrapidity at the lhc indicates that higher order corrections in should be important in midrapidity at the lhc energy .",
    "therefore , we believe that our predictions for @xmath0 at midrapidity may be less reliable compared to our results for the very forward rapidity collisions .    it should be noted that the particle production cross - section given by is intrinsically asymmetric , namely it treats the projectile proton approximately in the collinear factorization framework while treating the target proton ( or nucleus ) in the cgc framework . strictly speaking ,",
    "this may be justified only for particle production in the collision of a dilute system on a dense system , such as particle production in mid or forward rapidity in pa collisions or in particle production in the very forward rapidity region in symmetric collisions , such as proton - proton or nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "therefore , our formalism can not be reliable for particle production in midrapidity in proton - proton collisions .",
    "unfortunately , this is also what one needs in order to calculate the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 in midrapidity .",
    "a better approach to particle production in midrapidity in symmetric collisions where both projectile and target are dilute ( for @xmath109 ) might be to use the @xmath110 factorization formalism , proven to lo accuracy for single inclusive hadron production @xcite .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present work and we leave it for a future study .",
    "we have quantitatively studied , for the first time , the contribution of both elastic and inelastic processes to single inclusive hadron production cross section at rhic and the lhc using the cgc formalism .",
    "we observe that inelastic contributions to single inclusive hadron production are significant at high transverse momentum and close to mid - rapidity . on the other hand ,",
    "their contribution is very small in the forward rapidity region .",
    "furthermore , we note that inclusion of these inelastic terms makes the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 grow faster with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "we make detailed predictions for @xmath0 at the lhc using the numerical solution of the running - coupling bk equation .",
    "we have studied various theoretical uncertainties associated with the choice of the initial saturation scale @xmath111 for a proton and nucleus .",
    "we have shown that the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 measured at the lhc in the forward rapidity region is a sensitive probe of the low - x dynamics and can help constrain @xmath111 further .",
    "we have shown that various theoretical uncertainties in our formalism are minimized at very forward rapidities at the lhc . therefore ,",
    "measuring the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 in the _ very forward region _ in proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc will be a robust test of gluon saturation dynamics and the color glass condensate formalism .",
