    "thirdly , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are slightly affected by the charm component in low @xmath9 region , while in high @xmath9 region , the form factors are quite sensitive to @xmath190 and they can be greatly suppressed by possible charm component .",
    "\\(3 ) it has been found that by adjusting these parameters within their reasonable regions , one can improve the estimations of the form factors to a certain degree but still can not solve the puzzle , especially to explain the behavior of @xmath16 form factor within the whole @xmath9 region consistently . due to the cancelation between @xmath209 and @xmath210 ,",
    "it is reasonable that @xmath8 tends to be a constant as @xmath211 @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to understand why @xmath7 and @xmath15 have such a quite different large @xmath9 behavior .",
    "especially it is hard to explain the rapid growth of @xmath15 , i.e. probably the logarithmic growth @xcite , reported by babar collaboration @xcite to be consistent with the previously obtained low @xmath9 behavior by cello and cleo collaborations @xcite .",
    "possible charm components @xmath207 and @xmath14 can shrink the gap between these two form factors to a certain degree , but it can not be the reason for such a large difference .",
    "we hope more experimental data on these form factors in large @xmath9 region can clarify the present situation .",
    "if the babar data is confirmed , then there may indeed indicate new physics in these form factors , since it is hard to be explained by the current adopted light - cone pqcd framework .",
