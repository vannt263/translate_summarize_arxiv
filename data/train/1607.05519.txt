    "the advances made in the fabrication of various types of semimetals have stimulated a huge number of research works in the past decade .",
    "examples include graphene @xcite , surface state of topological insulator @xcite , and weyl semimetal @xcite , _",
    "etc_. one common feature shared by these materials is that the valence and conduction bands touch at discrete points , with massless dirac or weyl fermions emerging as the low - lying elementary excitations .",
    "graphene , being one layer carbon atoms arranged on a honeycomb lattice , is a typical two - dimensional ( 2d ) dirac semimetal @xcite , which has been extensively studied by theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the gapless surface state of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators , which is protected by time - reversal symmetry , can also be modeled by a 2d dirac semimetal @xcite .",
    "recently , stable 3d dirac semimetal state , which is protected by crystal symmetry , has been found to exist in na@xmath5bi @xcite and cd@xmath5as@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition , weyl semimetal , in which the low - energy fermionic excitations display liner dispersion around pairs of nodes with opposite chirality , has been observed in taas @xcite , nbas @xcite , tap @xcite , and nbp @xcite by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "weyl semimetals do not have a bulk gap , but are topologically nontrivial , analogous to topological insulators .",
    "cooper pairing instability in 2d dirac semimetal has attracted considerable interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that phonon or plasmon may mediate an effective attraction between dirac fermions @xcite . for an undoped 2d dirac semimetal , superconductivity can be realized only when the net attraction is sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from the conventional metal superconductors , in which even an arbitrarily weak attraction suffices to trigger cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "the difference is owing to the fact that the density of states ( dos ) of dirac fermions vanishes as one approaches the discrete dirac points ( zero energy ) , namely @xmath7 .",
    "the critical strength of bcs coupling defines a quantum critical point ( qcp ) between dirac semimetal phase and superconducting phase at zero temperature .",
    "it has been proposed recently that an effective supersymmetry emerges at the qcp between semimetal phase and @xmath8-wave superconducting phase for the surface state of a 3d topological insulator @xcite .",
    "the emergent supersymmetry is predicted to have observable consequences , such as an exact relation between optical conductivity and two seemingly unrelated quantities including shear viscosity and entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem is how superconductivity in a 2d dirac fermion system is affected by disorder , which always exists in real materials .",
    "anderson theorem states that weak non - magnetic disorder does not alter the superconducting gap @xmath3 and the critical temperature @xmath4 in @xmath8-wave superconductors @xcite . however , dirac semimetals differ from normal metals in some aspects , which might make the anderson theorem invalid .",
    "it is known that there are several types of disorder in 2d dirac semimetals @xcite , including random scalar potential , random gauge potential , and random mass , _",
    "etc_. among these possible disorders , random scalar potential is most frequently studied in the literature .",
    "renormalization group ( rg ) analysis showed that random scalar potential is a relevant perturbation to dirac fermions @xcite : even though its bare strength is very small , the effective strength grows rapidly in the low - energy regime . as a result",
    ", the dirac fermion system is turned into a diffusive state , in which disorder generates a finite scattering rate @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the fermions acquire a finite zero - energy dos @xmath1 as a function of @xmath0 , which vanishes as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "anderson theorem is based on a crucial assumption that the low - energy dos is not sensitive to weak disorder@xcite .",
    "apparently , this assumption is destroyed by random scalar potential , thus it is not unreasonable to expect a disorder - induced modification of superconductivity in 2d dirac semimetals .",
    "recently , nandkishore _",
    "@xcite studied the influence of random scalar potential on superconductivity by taking the surface electronic state of a 3d topological insulator as an example . after solving the mean - field gap equation in combination with a rg analysis @xcite",
    ", they claimed that an arbitrarily weak attraction leads to superconductivity , as a consequence of disorder - induced enhancement of fermion dos .",
    "a clear conclusion of this result is that random scalar potential promotes superconductivity .    subsequently , potirniche _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the interplay of superconductivity and random scalar potential within a hubbard model defined on honeycomb lattices with an on - site attractive coupling @xmath10 by means of self - consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations @xcite . in the clean limit",
    ", they found that the system remains a semimetal if @xmath10 is smaller than certain critical value @xmath11 , but becomes superconducting when @xmath12 . including random scalar potential results in a complicated disorder - dependence of superconductivity . in the strong coupling regime @xmath12",
    ", disorder suppresses superconductivity . in the weak coupling regime @xmath13 ,",
    "weak disorder enhances superconductivity , but strong disorder eventually destroys superconductivity .    the disorder effects on superconductivity in 2d dirac semimetals have recently been studied by means of the rg approach by wang _",
    "@xcite , who found that random scalar potential ( also called random chemical potential ) suppresses superconductivity . apparently , this rg result is different from that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the gap equation approach .",
    "to examine whether random scalar potential promotes or suppresses superconductivity , we revisit this issue by analyzing the gap equation in a disordered 2d dirac semimetal .",
    "we suppose there is only one species of dirac fermions in 2d space , which corresponds to the surface state of a 3d topological insulator @xcite .",
    "we choose this setup for two reasons .",
    "first , this system corresponds to the simplest case , so it is not necessary to consider the pairing between dirac fermions of different valleys .",
    "second , this model is exactly the one studied by nandkishore _",
    "@xcite previously , which will allow us to make a direct comparison between different calculations .",
    "the finite scattering rate @xmath0 induced by random scalar potential has two important effects . on the one hand , it leads to shorter lifetime of dirac fermions . on the other hand",
    ", it induces a finite zero - energy dos @xmath1 that depends on @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", one can verify that @xmath14 with @xmath15 being an ultraviolet cutoff , which can also be simplified to @xmath16 if the weak logarithmic correction is ignored @xcite .",
    "the former effect can break cooper pairs , but the latter tends to enhance cooper pairing .",
    "these two opposed tendencies compete with each other , and the final fate of superconductivity should be determined by the outcome of such a competition .",
    "we notice that , in the gap equation analysis of nandkishore _",
    "@xcite , the disorder - induced enhancement of dos was considered , whereas the disorder - induced change of fermion lifetime was missed .",
    "we will incorporate the disorder scattering rate @xmath0 into the gap equation in a proper way , so that both of the two competing effects of disorder are takin into account . after doing detailed computations",
    ", we find that superconductivity is actually suppressed by random scalar potential , which increases the critical coupling @xmath2 , decreases the superconducting gap , and reduces the critical temperature .",
    "clearly , the disorder - induced shortening of fermion lifetime plays a more important role than the disorder - induced enhancement of the zero - energy dos .",
    "this conclusion is also consistent with the recent rg analysis @xcite .",
    "we will also consider the case of a doped 2d dirac semimetal , which is equivalent to a 2d dirac fermion system defined at a finite chemical potential @xmath17 . at a finite @xmath17 ,",
    "the system develops a finite but small fermi surface with a finite zero - energy dos .",
    "extensive previous studies have showed that superconductivity can be induced by an arbitrarily weak attraction in this case @xcite .",
    "if the system is delicately doped to the vicinity of van hove singularity , chiral superconductivity with novel pairing symmetry may be realized @xcite .",
    "we ignore the possibility of such chiral superconductivity , and only study the case of small doping .",
    "another problem is the symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "for the surface state of 3d topological insulator , @xmath8-wave pairing is the only possibility at @xmath18 @xcite . for a finite @xmath17",
    ", there might be a mixing of @xmath8-wave gap and @xmath19-wave gap , but the @xmath19-wave component is small when @xmath17 is not very large @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider only the @xmath8-wave paring in a lightly doped dirac semimetal . under these conditions ,",
    "we make a systematic analysis of the impact of random scalar potential on superconductivity at finite @xmath17 and finite temperature @xmath20 . a detailed dependence of superconducting gap on @xmath17 and @xmath20 is presented , which clearly shows the suppression of superconductivity by disorder .",

    "in summary , we have studied the impact of random scalar potential on the @xmath8-wave superconducting gap @xmath3 and critical temperature @xmath4 in the context of 2d dirac semimetals . after solving the gap equations analytically and numerically",
    ", we have showed that a finite disorder scattering rate leads to strong suppression of superconductivity .",
    "in particular , the scattering rate increases the critical bcs coupling @xmath2 needed to trigger cooper pairing , suppresses the magnitude of superconducting gap , and lowers the critical temperature .",
    "we have also considered the case of a finite chemical potential , and found that superconductivity is also suppressed .    according to mermin - wagner theorem @xcite",
    ", there is not a true long - range superconducting order at finite temperatures in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "the transition at @xmath132 is known to be a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition with a quasi long - range order below @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the critical value @xmath94 obtained in this paper and a number of previous work @xcite is greater than @xmath132 , but provides an upper bound for @xmath132 .",
    "@xmath94 can be considered as a temperature at which the magnitude of superconducting order parameter becomes non - zero , but the phase coherence sets in only when @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "loktev and turkowski calculated @xmath134 in a 2d dirac fermion system by considering the fluctuation of superconducting order parameter @xcite . studying",
    "the concrete dependence of @xmath134 on disorder is an interesting problem , but beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we would like to give a further remark on the anderson theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem is widely believed to be valid in conventional metal superconductors that possess a homogenous @xmath8-wave gap , but is broken for unconventional superconductors @xcite . for anderson theorem to hold",
    ", the scale of finite disorder scattering rate should be much smaller than the scale of dos at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "in conventional metals , the fermi surface is finite and the dos at the fermi level @xmath1 takes certain large value . in case",
    "the disorder scattering rate @xmath0 is much smaller than @xmath1 , the above condition is satisfied .",
    "however , it is known that @xmath7 in undoped dirac semimetal , thus any finite @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the anderson theorem is invalid in this case , and disorder may have remarkable influence on superconductivity . if a 2d dirac semimetal is doped so that fermions have a finite chemical potential @xmath17 , this condition is still fulfilled provided that @xmath135 .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath3 and @xmath94 would be nearly unchanged by disorder if @xmath136 , but can be strongly suppressed as @xmath0 is sufficiently large .    in this work ,",
    "our consideration is restricted to the simplest @xmath8-wave superconductivity . for the surface state of a 3d topological insulator",
    ", the @xmath8-wave gap can mix with a novel @xmath19-wave gap @xcite . due to the structure of honeycomb lattice , mixing of @xmath8-wave and @xmath19-wave symmetries",
    "can exist on honeycomb lattices under certain conditions even when chemical potential is zero @xcite .",
    "it was proposed that a chiral @xmath137-wave superconductivity that breaks time - reversal symmetry may be realized in highly doped graphene where the dos has a von hove singularity @xcite .",
    "studying the disorder effects on superconductivity in these novel non-@xmath8-wave superconductors and various types of weyl semimetals @xcite is also interesting .",
