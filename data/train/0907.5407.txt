    "nuclear astrophysics is the field concerning  the synthesis and evolution of atomic nuclei , by thermonuclear reactions , from the big bang to the present .",
    "what is the origin of the matter of which we are made?\"@xcite .",
    "our high entropy universe resulting from the big bang , contains many more photons per particle of matter with mass , e.g. protons and neutrons .",
    "because of the high entropy as the universe expanded , there was time to manufacture elements only upto helium and the major products of cosmic nucleosynthesis remained the light elements hydrogen and helium seen in the universe today and the entire helium may not be a product of big bang nucleosynthesis alone . ] .",
    "stars formed from this primordial matter .",
    "they used these elements , hydrogen and helium as fuel to generate energy like a giant nuclear reactor . in the process",
    ", the stars could shine and manufacture higher atomic number elements like carbon , oxygen , calcium and iron which we and our world are made of .",
    "the heavy elements are either dredged up from the core of the star to the surface of the star from which they are dispersed by stellar wind or directly ejected into the interstellar medium when a ( massive ) star explodes .",
    "the stardust is the source of heavy elements for new generation of stars and sun - like systems .",
    "our sun is _ not _ a massive star .",
    "it burns hydrogen in a set of nuclear reactions called the pp - chain , whereas the more massive stars _",
    "presently _ burn their hydrogen by the so - called cno - cycle . nevertheless , to put nuclear reactions in stars in perspective",
    ", we shall start with a discussion of how these reactions proceed within the sun .",
    "there is a correspondence between the evolutionary state of a star , its external appearance and internal core conditions and the nuclear fuel it burns ,  a sort of a mapping between the astronomers hertzsprung - russel diagram and the nuclear physicist s chart of the nuclide @xcite , until nuclear burning takes place on too rapid a time scale .",
    "the problem of evolution of stars to their explosion and subsequent interaction with the circumstellar medium has many time scales ( ranging from tens of milliseconds to tens of thousands of years ) and macroscopic length scales ( from dimensions effectively that of a white dwarf to that of a supernova remnant , i.e from few thousand kilometers to many tens of light years ) .",
    "the physics of supernova explosions is complex and diverse and in many parts , the explosion mechanism is still an unsolved problem .",
    "even the constraining parameters and ingredients which makes the sn explode are still controversial ( see e.g. the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the identification of the key aspects in the explosion may require seminal observations about the conditions in the supernova core other than the indirect evidence such as explosion asymmetries , pulsar kicks or nucleosynthetic yields .",
    "such observations may involve the future detection of strong neutrino signals and gravitational waves from a galactic supernova in future .",
    "detectable neutrino signals from a supernova was seen in the case of sn 1987a , but since that target was in a neighboring satellite galaxy ( the large magellanic cloud ) , the number of neutrinos were too small to distinguish the fine points of theoretical issues .    since nuclear astrophysics",
    "is not usually taught at the master s level nuclear physics specialization in our universities , these lecture notes are meant to be an introduction to the subject and a pointer to literature and internet resourcessn2004 . ] .",
    "the emphasis in the first part of these lecture notes is on the nuclear reactions in the stars and how these are calculated , rather than how stars evolve .",
    "the latter usually forms a core area of stellar astrophysics .",
    "this article is organized essentially in the same sequence that a massive star burns successively higher atomic number elements in its core , until it collapses and explodes in a supernova .",
    "the introductory part discusses how the rates of thermonuclear reactions in ( massive ) stars are calculated , what the different classes of reactions are and how the stars ( usually ) manage to burn their fuels so slowly .",
    "the middle part describes the nuclear physics during the collapse phase of the massive star .",
    "the last part describes a few typical examples of what can be learned by optical , ir and x - ray studies about nucleosynthesis and dynamics of explosion in supernovae and supernova remnants such as cassiopeia a , sn 1987a etc .",
    "only core - collapse supernovae are discussed in these lectures , those that arise from massive stars ( e.g. stars more massive than @xmath0 with typical solar metallicity at the time they start burning hydrogen in their cores , i.e. at the  zero age main sequence \" , before any mass was lost from their surface ) .",
    "we shall not discuss the type ia sne and are very useful to map the geometry of our universe , because they serve as calibratable  standard \" candles .",
    "these  thermonuclear supernovae \" are usually more luminous in the optical bands than the core - collapse varieties , but while the former class put out several mevs of energy per nucleon , the core - collapse sne or ccsne , emit several _ hundreds _ of mevs per nucleon from their _ central engines _ ( mostly in down - scattered neutrinos ) . apart from the missing hydrogen lines ,",

    "while referring to sir ernest rutherford  breaking down the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen \" , arthur eddington remarked : ",
    "what is possible in the cavendish laboratory may not be too difficult in the sun \" @xcite .",
    "indeed this is the case , but for the fact that a star does this by fusion reactions , rather than by transfer reactions ,  in the process giving out heat and light and manufacturing fresh elements .",
    "of all the light elements , hydrogen is the most important one in this regard , because : a ) it has a large universal abundance , b ) considerable energy evolution is possible with it because of the large binding energies of nuclei that can be generated from its burning and c ) its small charge and mass allows it to penetrate easily through the potential barriers of other nuclei .",
    "a star burns its fuel in thermonuclear reactions in the core where the confinement of the fuel is achieved in the star s own gravitational field .",
    "these reactions remain  controlled \" , or self - regulated , as long as the stellar material remains non - degenerate .    the recognition of the quantum mechanical tunneling effect prompted atkinson and houtermans @xcite to work out the qualitative treatment of energy production in stars .",
    "they suggested that the nucleus serves as both a cooking pot and a trap .",
    "binding energy difference of four protons and two electrons ( the nuclear fuel ) and their ash , the helium nucleus , some 26.7 mev is converted to heat and light that we receive from the sun .",
    "this turned out to be much shorter than the estimated age of the earth at that time known from fossil records , and led to a famous debate between lord kelvin and the fossil geologist cuvier .",
    "in fact , as noted above modern estimates of earth s age are much longer and therefore the need to maintain sunshine for such a long time requires that the amount of energy radiated by the sun during its lifetime is much larger than its gravitational energy or its internal ( thermal ) energy : @xmath1 .",
    "this puzzle was resolved only later with the realization that the star can tap its much larger nuclear energy reservoir in its core through thermonuclear reactions .",
    "the luminosity of the sun however is determined by an interplay of atomic and gravitational physics that controls the opacity , chemical composition , the balance of pressure forces against gravity , etc .",
    "nuclear physics determines how fast nuclear reactions go under under feedback control determined by the ambient conditions . ] .",
    "the photons in the interior are scattered many a times , for tens of millions of years , before they reach the surface of the sun .",
    "some of the reactions produce neutrinos , which because of their small cross - section for interaction , are not stopped or scattered by overlying matter ,  but stream out straight from the core .",
    "neutrinos are thus the best probes of the stellar core @xcite , while the photons bear information from their surface of last scattering  the photosphere .",
    "the sun has been burning for at least 4.6 billion years gyr old @xcite .",
    "radioactive dating of meteorites point to their formation and the solidification of the earth about @xmath2 years ago @xcite .",
    "since the sun and the solar system formed only slightly before , their age at isolation and condensation from the interstellar medium is taken to be 4.6 gyr @xcite . ] .",
    "how does it manage to burn so slowly ? under the ambient conditions in the core , the relevant thermonuclear reaction cross sections are very small . for reactions involving charged particles",
    ", nuclear physicists often encounter cross - sections near the coulomb barrier of the order of millibarns .",
    "one can obtain a characteristic luminosity @xmath3 based on this cross section and the nuclear energy released per reaction @xcite :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the fraction of total number of solar nuclei @xmath6 that take part in nuclear fusion reactions generating typically @xmath7 mev in hydrogen to helium conversion . here",
    ", the @xmath8 is the characteristic time scale for reactions , which becomes minuscule for the cross - sections at the coulomb barrier and the ambient density and relative speed of the reactants etc :    @xmath9 [ \\sigma / 1 \\rm \\ ; mbarn ] [ v /10 ^ 9 \\rm \\ ; cm \\ ; s^{-1 } ] } \\ ] ]    this would imply a characteristic luminosity of @xmath10 , even for a small fraction of the solar material taking part in the reactions ( i.e. @xmath11 ) . if this was really the appropriate cross - section for the reaction , the sun would have been gone very quickly indeed .",
    "instead the cross - sections are much less than that at the coulomb barrier penetration energy ( say at proton energies of 1 mev ) , to allow for a long lifetime of the sun ( in addition , weak - interaction process gives a smaller cross - section for some reactions than electromagnetic process ,  see section 3.1 ) .",
    "stellar nuclear reactions can be either : a ) charged particle reactions ( both target and projectile are nuclei ) or b ) neutral particle ( neutron ) induced reactions .",
    "both sets of reactions can go through either a resonant state of an intermediate nucleus or can be a non - resonant reaction . in the former reaction , the intermediate state could be a narrow unstable state , which decays into other particles or nuclei .",
    "in general , a given reaction can involve both types of reaction channels . in charged",
    "particle induced reactions , the cross - section for both reaction mechanisms drops rapidly with decreasing energy , due to the effect of the coulomb barrier ( and thus it becomes more difficult to measure stellar reaction cross - sections accurately ) .",
    "in contrast , the neutron induced reaction cross - section is very large and increases with decreasing energy ( here , resonances may be superposed on a smooth non - resonant yield which follows the @xmath12 dependence ) .",
    "these reaction rates and cross - sections can be then directly measured at stellar energies that are relevant ( if such nuclei are long lived or can be generated ) .",
    "the schematic dependence of the cross - sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - sections ] .",
    "we shall not discuss the neutron capture elements in these notes .",
    "the sun and other  main - sequence \" stars ( burning hydrogen in their core quiescently ) evolve very slowly by adjusting their central temperature such that the average thermal energy of a nucleus is small compared to the coulomb repulsion an ion - ion pair encounters .",
    "this is how stars can live long for astronomically long times .",
    "a central temperature @xmath13k ( or @xmath14 , hereafter a subscript x to a quantity , indicates that quantity in units of @xmath15 ) is required for sufficient kinetic energy of the reactants to overcome the coulomb barrier and for thermonuclear reactions involving hydrogen to proceed at an effective rate , even though fusion reactions have positive q values i.e. net energy is liberated out of the reactions .",
    "the classical turning point radius for a projectile of charge @xmath16 and kinetic energy @xmath17 ( in a coulomb potential @xmath18 , and effective height of the coulomb barrier @xmath19 for a p + p reaction ) , is : @xmath20 .",
    "thus , classically a p + p reaction would proceed only when the kinetic energy exceeds 550 kev . since the number of particles traveling at a given speed is given by the maxwell boltzmann ( mb ) distribution @xmath21 ,",
    "only the tail of the mb distribution above 550 kev is effective when the typical thermal energy is 0.86 kev ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the ratio of the tails of the mb distributions : @xmath23 is quite minuscule , and thus classically at typical stellar temperatures this reaction will be virtually absent .    although classically a particle with projectile energy @xmath17 can not penetrate beyond the classical turning point , quantum mechanically , one has a finite value of the squared wave function at the nuclear radius @xmath24 .",
    "the probability that the incoming particle penetrates the barrier is :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 are the wave - functions at corresponding points .",
    "bethe @xcite solved the schroedinger equation for the coulomb potential and obtained the transmission probability:-    @xmath27\\bigg)\\ ] ]    with @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this probability reduces to a much simpler relation at the low energy limit : @xmath29 , which is equivalent to the classical turning point @xmath30 being much larger than the nuclear radius @xmath31 .",
    "the probability is :    @xmath32 = exp[-31.3z_1z_2({\\mu \\over e})^{1/2}]\\ ] ]    where in the second equality , @xmath33 is the reduced mass in atomic mass units and e is the center of mass energy in kev . the exponential quantity involving the square brackets in the second expression is called the  gamow factor \" .",
    "the reaction cross - section between particles of charge @xmath34 and @xmath16 has this exponential dependence due to the gamow factor .",
    "in addition , because the cross - sections are essentially  areas \" : proportional to @xmath35 , it is customary to write the cross - section , with these two energy dependences filtered out :    @xmath36    where the factor @xmath37 is called the astrophysical s - factor . the s - factor may contain degeneracy factors due to spin , e.g. @xmath38 $ ] as reaction cross - sections are summed over final states and averaged over initial states . because the rapidly varying parts of the cross - section ( with energy ) are thus filtered out , the s - factor is a slowly varying function of center of mass energy , at least for the non - resonant reactions .",
    "it is thus much safer to extrapolate @xmath37 to the energies relevant for astrophysical environments from the laboratory data , which is usually generated at higher energies ( due to difficulties of measuring small cross - sections ) , than directly extrapolating the @xmath39 , which contains the gamow transmission factor ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sigmavss - fac ] ) . additionally , in order to relate @xmath39 and @xmath37 , quantities measured in the laboratory to these relevant quantities in the solar interior , a correction factor @xmath40 due to the effects of electron screening needs to be taken into account @xcite .     or the lower limit @xmath41 of laboratory measurements .",
    "the y - scale is logarithmic for cross - section but linear for s - factor ; thus the cross section drops sharply in regions of astrophysical interest , while the change is much less severe for the s - factor .",
    "the extrapolation of laboratory data to lower energies relevant for astrophysical situations is more reliable for s - factor .",

    "therefore , the thermally averaged reaction rate per particle pair is :    @xmath43    the thermally averaged reaction rate per pair is , utilizing the astrophysical s - factor and the energy dependence of the gamow - factor :    @xmath44de\\ ] ]    with @xmath45 mev , @xmath46 being called the gamow energy .",
    "note that in the expression for the reaction rate above , at low energies , the exponential term @xmath47 becomes very small whereas at high energies the maxwell boltzmann factor @xmath48 vanishes .",

    "the he - like triplet of si and s lines shows strong forbidden ( f ) and resonance lines ( r ) and a comparatively weaker intercombination line ( i ) ( see section 4.5 of @xcite for an illustration of these transitions in o - ions ) .",
    "the g - ratio @xmath571 is , for example , a good diagnostic of the electron temperature @xcite .",
    "thus the measured line ratios and abundance ratios of h- and he - like ions of the same element ( say si ) were used @xcite to measure the electron temperature @xmath572 and the ionization time scale @xmath573 ( @xmath574 being the electron density and @xmath575 being for example the time since the region was hit by the shock ) .",
    "the results of @xcite show that for most of the selected regions , resolved spectroscopy of si he - like triplet lines and si h - like lines yields temperatures around @xmath576 , consistent with reverse shocked ejecta .",
    "however , two regions , ( designated r8 and r10 ) had significantly higher temperatures @xmath577 , and could be part of the circumstellar material .",
    "the dominant element in cas a seems to be oxygen , and the electron density in the x - ray line emitting regions seem to vary between 20 to 200 @xmath578 , which is more typical of the unshocked interior of the ir line - emitting plasma , than that at the shock front as shown in @xcite ( see above ) .",
    "lazendic et al had derived unambiguous doppler shifts for their selected 17 regions . while the se region of the snr show mostly blue shifted velocities reaching upto @xmath579 ( compare the ir line velocities in the south @xmath564 ) , the nw side of the snr had extreme red shifted values up to @xmath580 ( compare ir line velocity in the north : @xmath565 ) .",

    "the hetg data implies a relatively low bulk radial velocity of the shocked gas in the ring compared to model expectation from a plane parallel strong shock entering stationary gas and the temperature range inferred from the spectral modeling of the emitting gas .",
    "since the x - ray image is correlated with the optical hot spots , it appears that the blast wave ahead of the sn ejecta is overtaking dense clumps of circumstellar gas in the hot spots .",
    "the blast wave may be encountering the dense clumps either at normal incidence or at oblique incidence . in the former case ,",
    "the reflected shock would give rise to gas that has been shocked twice and having nearly stationary bilk velocity but further elevated temperature . with more and more x - ray emission coming from gas behind reflected shocks , there would be an increase of the fraction of higher temperature x - ray emission , consistent with what is seen .",
    "if the blast wave encounters dense clumps at an oblique incidence , the shocked gas will have significant velocity component parallel to the shock surface , and a significantly fast transmitted component emitting x - rays can result .",
    "the doppler broadening seen in the line profiles of the chandra data seems to suggest that both transmitted and reflected shocks encountering the circumstellar ring at normal and oblique angles may be at play @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray , x - ray , optical and infrared line spectroscopy of sne and snrs have been used to observe nucleosynthesis and the abundance distribution of elements freshly synthesized ( both radioactive isotopes and stable decay products ) and to extract dynamical information about the explosion . in particular",

    "the discovery @xcite of the 1157 kev gamma - ray line emission transition in @xmath597 reached from @xmath598 following electron capture . ] from cas a with the compton gamma ray observatory was the first direct proof of synthesis of this short lived , freshly made radio - isotope in sne .",
    "renaud et al @xcite using the integral spacecraft recently reported the detection of both 67.9 and 78.4 kev gamma - ray lines of @xmath598 in cas a. there was a clear separation of the two lines due to an improved detection of the hard x - ray continuum up to 100 kev .",

    "this is actually high compared to the predictions of the standard models @xcite , @xcite , or their improved versions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since the production of @xmath445 is sensitive to the explosion energy and asymmetries and cas a is known to be asymmetric and energetic ( @xmath601 erg instead of the standard @xmath602 erg ) , this could be a factor in its apparent overproduction compared to models . at the same time , the recent revision of the @xmath603 reaction rate @xcite has led to an increase of @xmath445 production by a factor of @xmath604 .",
    "live radioactive isotopes freshly synthesized in the explosion were detected from sn 1987a by directly detecting 1238 kev and 847 kev gamma - ray lines @xcite , which provided detailed diagnostics of the nuclear burning conditions and the explosion dynamics .",
    "another radio - nuclide @xmath590 , which is a decay product of @xmath605 made in the supernova explosion , was also detected directly by measuring gamma - ray lines @xcite .",
    "the calculated gamma - ray light curves for 847 kev and 1238 kev and other lines @xcite could be made consistent with the solar maximum mission ( smm ) measurement only if the @xmath587 was mixed up to a mass coordinate of @xmath606 .",
    "the calculated fluxes were still slightly smaller than the observed fluxes at @xmath607 , but this discrepancy could be removed by taking account of the effect of clumpiness in the ejecta which is more significant in the earlier phases . also , the observed flux ratio between the two gamma - ray lines at 847 kev and 1238 kev is close to unity at early stages because of the smaller cross section for the 1238 kev lines than for 847 kev .",
    "as the column depth of the overlying matter decreased due to dilution with time in an expanding envelope , the observed flux ratio approached the expected value of 0.68 based on branching ratios @xcite .",
    "x - ray fluorescence spectrometry technique has been used by archaeologists to determine the major and trace elements in ceramics , glass etc . here , a sample is irradiated with x - rays and the wavelengths of the released ( fluorescent ) x - rays are measured .",
    "since different elements have characteristic wavelengths , they can be identified and their concentrations estimated from the intensity of the released x - rays .",
    "trace elements analysis may , for example , help in identifying the ( geographical ) source of a material .",
    "a similar method has been proposed @xcite and attempted for sn 1987a @xcite .",
    "it utilizes electron capture decays of freshly synthesized radio - nuclei .",
    "following the electron capture , the k - shell vacancies are in most cases filled in by downward transitions from other bound shells",
    ". as the fluorescence x - ray yields are well known , measuring the x - ray line fluxes can then estimate the number of freshly synthesized nuclei .",
    "for example , attempts were made to detect the 5.9 kev k@xmath71 line from the stable nucleus @xmath608 in the chandra x - ray spectrum of sn 1987a , which is due to the decay of radioactive @xmath609 .",
    "both @xmath610 and @xmath611 are produced in explosive , incomplete si burning as well as in normal freezeout of nuclear statistical equilibrium , in the inner ejecta of core collapse supernovae .",
    "however , no evidence of the 5.9 kev line emission from mn could be found in 400 ks of chandra acis data and the upper limit to the mean flux was @xmath612 .",
    "rauscher et al @xcite calculated the ejected mass of @xmath613 radioactive nuclei to be @xmath614 for @xmath615 models of which most was @xmath616 . if only about half this mass of @xmath609 were ejected , the reduced flux would be consistent with the observed upper limit . on the other hand the",
    ", even if the total mass inside were as much as @xmath617 , but the @xmath609 abundance was zero outside the radial velocity shells at @xmath618 , the line flux would be still consistent with data , as at late times the emerging flux depends sensitively on the presence of @xmath609 in the outer zones .",
    "apart from sn 1987a , which occurred close by and was therefore easy to detect , there are supernovae with relatively high intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "sn 1993j and sn 1995n are two of them and they are at the high end of the x - ray luminosity @xcite , @xcite , which makes it suitable for study in the x - ray wave bands even at late stages @xcite .",
    "nymark et al @xcite have shown that sne with strong x - ray emission are likely to have radiative shocks and that in these shocks a large range of temperatures contribute to the spectrum .",
    "the cooling of the shock also affects the hydrodynamics of the flow structure and the volume of the emitting gas and thus the total luminosity from the interaction region .",
    "a shock is radiative depending on whether the cooling time scale @xmath619 of the shock is short compared to its expansion time @xmath575 .",
    "since the cooling function ( from electron bremsstrahlung or free - free scattering and x - ray line emission from bound - bound transitions of ionized atomic species ) is a function of the shock temperature this condition translates to a condition on the shock temperature for radiative vs. adiabatic shock .",
    "the boundary of the two regimes depends upon the shock velocity @xmath620 and the ejecta density profile ( given by the index @xmath621 in @xmath622 ) and the separation in turn depends upon the chemical composition of the ejecta ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shock - regimes ] reproduced from @xcite ) . for a given shock velocity ( and a composition and mass loss parameter of the progenitor stellar wind and the ejecta velocity scale ) , the shock is likely to be radiative for steeper density gradients .",

    "the boundaries depend upon the composition of the ejecta through which the shock may be propagating as also the mass loss parameter of the progenitor stellar wind and the ejecta velocity scale ( fig .",
    "courtesy t. nymark @xcite ) . , height=226 ]    as already mentioned , the spectroscopic type of sn 1993j from a type ii - like sn at early times due to detected balmer lines soon weakened and it came to resemble a type ib sn , leading to a reclassification as a type iib sn @xcite .",
    "this transition is best explained if the progenitor star prior to its explosion , had lost its hydrogen envelope due to interaction with a binary companion @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "if the h - envelope was indeed already thin , then the reverse shock would transit the h - rich region quickly , and soon the emission may be dominated by material dredged up from the nuclear processed parts of the star in the interior . in the 4h47 model of shigeyama et al @xcite , by 2600 days after explosion , the hydrogen - rich envelope had @xmath623 . inside",
    "this envelope is the outer part of the he - zone which is enriched in n ( about @xmath624 ) , while its inner part is c - rich ( has @xmath625 ) . if the circumstellar medium or the ejecta is clumpy , they may be hit by the reverse shock obliquely and the shock in the clump will be slower and the shock temperature lower .",
    "the presence of both hard x - rays and optical emission from the shocked csm shows the importance of a clumpy csm , for example in sn 1987a where a range of shock speeds are necessary to explain the observed spectrum @xcite .",
    "sn 1993j is not as bright as sn 1987a or cas a due to its larger distance , and both chandra and xmm - newton data is comparatively of a moderate signal to noise , at the low ( ccd ) resolution .",
    "the xmm spectrum of sn 1993j is dominated by the fe l emission at 0.7 - 1.0 kev and is blended with strong ne ix - x emission . above 1.0 kev , emission lines which may be present are from mg xi - xii , si xiii - xiv , as well as s xvi .",
    "nymark et al find that the spectrum of sn 1993j is fit best by a combination of an adiabatic shock ( @xmath626 ) propagating through a zone with cno burning products , with he dominant and n and ne being the most abundant metals , and a second radiative shock ( @xmath627 ) .",
    "the latter could have been caused by instabilities at the reverse shock front or by a clumpy csm .",

    "these supernovae show the presence of strong , narrow balmer line emission on top of the broader emission lines in their early spectra .",
    "the narrow emission lines may originate in the dense and ionized circumstellar ( cs ) gas @xcite . the presence of strong h@xmath71 emission line , the high bolometric luminosity and the broad h@xmath71 emission base powered by the interaction of the supernova shock with the csm , all point towards a very dense circumstellar environment @xcite .",
    "when the stellar core collapses and explodes , the supernova lights up the slow - moving gas into narrow emission lines leading to the type iin supernova classification ( n for narrow emission line ) .",
