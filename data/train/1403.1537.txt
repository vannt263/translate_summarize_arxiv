    "yakov borisovich zeldovich was very talented .",
    "his active scientific career included major contributions in fields as diverse as chemical physics ( adsorption & catalysis ) , the theory of shock waves , thermal explosions , the theory of flame propogation , the theory of combustion & detonation , nuclear & particle physics , and , during the latter part of his life : gravitation , astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "made key contributions in all these area s , nurturing a creative and thriving scientific community in the process .",
    "his total scientific output exceeds 500 research article and 20 books . indeed , after meeting him , the famous english physicist stephen hawking wrote `` now i know that you are a real person and not a group of scientists like the bourbaki''.@xmath0 others have compared his enormously varied scientific output to that of lord raleigh who , a hundred years before , worked on fields as varied as optics and engineering .",
    "remarkably never received any formal university education !",
    "he graduated from high school in st .",
    "petersburg at the age of 15 after which he joined the _ institute for mechanical processing of useful minerals _ ( ` mekhanabor ' ) to train as a laboratory assistant .",
    "the depth of s questioning and his deep interest in science soon reached senior members of the scientific community and , in 1931 , the influential soviet scientist a.f .",
    "ioffe wrote a letter to mekhanabor requesting that be `` released to science '' . defended his phd in 1936 and , years later ,",
    "reminiscenced of the `` happy times when permission to defend [ a phd ] was granted to people who had no higher education '' .    despite his never having been formally taught ( or perhaps because of it ! ) developed a very original style of doing science , and became , in the process , an exceptional teacher .",
    "it is also interesting that in his early years had been an experimentalist as well as a theoretician , and this closeness to complementary aspects of science guided him throughout his later life .",
    "it is quite remarkable that ventured into a totally new field  astrophysics  around 1964 when he was nearing 50 . by then had already developed a very considerable reputation in fields ranging from physical chemistry ( there is a ` zeldovich number ' in combustion theory ) to nuclear physics .",
    "indeed , having done pathbreaking work on combustion and detonation , moved to nuclear physics in the 1930 s writing seminal papers demonstrating the possibility of controlled fission chain reactions among uranium isotopes .",
    "this was the time when fascism was on the rise in germany , and , in an effort for national survival , the soviet union was developing its own atomic program of which ( then in his mid 20 s ) quickly became a key member . according to andrei sakharov , `` from the very beginning of soviet work on the atomic ( and later thermonuclear ) problem , was at the very epicenter of events .",
    "his role there was completely exceptional '' @xcite .",
    "one might add that s earlier work on combustion paved the way for creating the internal ballistics of solid - fuel rockets which formed the basis of the soviet missile program during the ` great patriotic war ' and after @xcite .",
    "sadly , much of zeldovich s work during this period remains classified to this day .",
    "after the war went on to do pioneering work in several other aspects of nuclear and particle physics including @xmath1 :    * in 1952 and 1953 proposed laws for the conservation of lepton and baryon charges . * in 1955 and gershtein suggested the conservation of the weak charged vector hadron current .",
    "this idea was independently discovered some years later by feynman and gell - mann and played a key role in the development of the theory of weak interactions .",
    "( 1959 ) also suggested the existence of neutral currents which violated parity conservation .",
    "he showed that parity violation in weak interactions should lead to the rotation of the plane of polarization of light propogating in a substance not containing optically active molecules . this prediction was subsequently confirmed .",
    "* in 1959 suggested a method of containment ( storage ) of slow neutrons via total internal reflection from graphite .",
    "this method is now regularly used to measure the neutron electrical moment . * also studied the possible existence of long - lived nuclei with a large isotopic spin .",
    "he suggested the possibility of observing an isotope of @xmath2 , soon after which this isotope was , in fact , discovered !",
    "instead of resting on his laurels ( had he so desired could have easily landed a ` comfortable ' job heading a premier research laboratory or institute ) , decided to change course midstream and , from about 1964 , devoted his phenomenal abilities to problems in astrophysics . @xmath3",
    "a change of track can be precarious if made later in life when ones scientific tastes and habits have usually become set .",
    "indeed , each scientific discipline has its own nuances the mastering of which can take considerable time and effort , and history is replete with examples of scientists  exceedingly capable in their chosen field  making grave errors of judgement when moving to another .",
    "it is therefore quite remarkable that not only plunged deeply into astrophysics , he virtually revolutionized the field , becoming in the process one of the founders of relativistic astrophysics and physical cosmology . below is an imperfect attempt to summarize some of zeldivich s seminal contributions to astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "`` glaza ne vidyat a ruki delayut ''  ya.b . zeldovich    _ transl . `` although the eyes do nt see the hands continue creating  @xmath78 . '' _    my first meeting with took place in 1978 when , as a student of physics at moscow state university , i was looking for a professor who would guide me for my ( pre - msc ) course work . agreed and , to test my skills , gave me a project in general relativity , a subject which i had just started to learn .",
    "i soon realized that was an excellent teacher and could explain in very simple language exceedingly complex physical ideas .",
    "this was a great boon to students since , despite his extremely busy scientific schedule , always found time to teach courses at moscow university .",
    "so it was that i was initiated into the intricate and beautiful field of cosmology via a twenty two lecture course taught by ",
    "each lecture being of roughly 2 hour duration with a ten minute break in between . particularly impressionable for us youngsters",
    "was the fact that though teaching a mathematically rigorous course , always took great pains to explain even the most difficult ideas using simple physical arguments and intution .",
    "( did this even at regular seminars .",
    "if one of the talks excited him then , when it ended , would bound up to the podium and provide an impromptu summary .",
    "his great breadth of interests allowed to summarize talks on virtually any subject and i have seen him apply this skill to topics ranging from stellar physics to particle physics and quantum gravity .",
    "i should add that these 2 minute summaries were invaluable to us students , since they were frequently more lucid and transparent than the original seminar ! )    continuously modified and expanded his course material taking care to ensure that significantly new developments in the field were covered .",
    "( on attending the very same cosmology course 4 years later , i was pleasantly surprised at finding that almost a quarter of its content was new .",
    "assiduously incorporated several recent developments including grand unification , topological defects and inflation , into his ` self - revised ' syllabus . )",
    "participants at his lectures consisted not only of students , but also senior researchers and professors , many of whom stayed back after class to discuss new science ideas with .",
    "another remarkable quality of was his willingness to learn from others and to acknowledge , often in public , the mistakes which he had made , and what could be learned from them .",
    "thus he admitted in class how he had misunderstood the data regarding the cosmic microwave background in the early 1960 s and , to his great regret , had initially advocated the cold big bang model instead of the hot one ( the latter had been predicted by gamow and subsequently shown to be correct ) .",
    "strove to explain complicated ideas simply through numerous entertaining articles and text books @xcite including his excellent monograph ` higher mathematics for beginners ' @xcite which presented serious mathematical ideas in a form which is accessible to a high school student .",
    "he once wrote `` the so - called ` strict ' proofs and definitions are far more complicated than the intuitive approach to derivatives and integrals . as a result ,",
    "the mathematical ideas necessary for an understanding of physics reach school - pupils too late .",
    "it is like serving the salt and pepper not for lunch , but later  for afternoon tea '' . in this",
    "was following an old physics tradition epitomized by landau in russia and einstein and feynman in the west , of bringing the excitement of science closer to students and ` ordinary ' people .",
    "zeldovich s manner of conducting exams was also quite unusual !",
    "when , towards the end of his cosmology course the time came for exams , i realised that there was no formal time table for a written test , as was usually the case @xmath79 . instead asked me to meet him outside his office a few days later",
    "when i did , scribbled two problems and asked me to solve them , after which he walked away .",
    "although i had gone through his course material diligently i could not , even after trying hard , figure out how either of these problems could be solved , and so feeling quite dejected i walked back to my hostel a few miles away .",
    "this was summer 1979 . by winter , with the heavy snows of moscow having set in , i managed to crack one of the problems and , feeling rather elated , went back to .",
    "subjected me to a strenuous viva - voce after which he declared that i had passed with an a and , even more significantly , that my solution to his problem was new and original and could be published as a paper @xmath80 .",
    "although most people found to be very inspiring , some of his colleagues found his intellectual brilliance rather intimidating .",
    "indeed did not ` suffer fools lightly ' and i have seen him demolish in less than a few minutes many a senior scientist propounding a silly idea .",
    "( at the same time was much more tolerant of students .",
    "i occasionally blundered in his presence only to see him smile and explain , with much patience and goodwill , just where i had gone wrong . ) set very high standards both for himself and the group of students and collaborator s who made up his school or _",
    "gharana_. in so doing he taught and nurtured a whole generation of talented russian scientists many of whom developed , in the course of his tutelage , diametrically complementary styles ranging from the highly intuitive to the rigorously mathematical .",
    "@xmath81 in this he was following the tradition of the other great russian _",
    "ustaad _ , landau , who like , fostered and left behind a great scientific legacy in the form of a _ gharana of physics _ which was almost unique in scientific method and style .",
    "i experienced empathy on many occasions .",
    "some years after commencing work on my phd i was shocked to hear that s wife had just died of a serious illness .",
    "together with some friends i went to pay my respects and offer condolences . even before i could utter a word , turned to me and offered his own profuse condolences on the assasination of indira gandhi who had lost her life to extremists the very same day that s wife lost hers to illness . in his eyes",
    "i could see how deeply he felt , and i was profoundly moved that he could place the historical anguish of a neighboring nation on the same footing as his own very deep and personal loss .    although very fond of travel , faced with numerous travel restrictions .",
    "due to his early involvement with the soviet defence program .",
    "in 1982 , perhaps because of my political innocence and youthful enthusiasm , i was very keen that visit india , and before embarking home for holidays asked him what i could do to ensure his visit .",
    "looking at me wistfully remarked , `` they ( the soviet authoroties ) will reply to your governments invitation saying is ill and unable to travel , but look at me ( flexed his muscles ) i am perfectly fit and can travel tomorrow ! '' .",
    "indeed s visit to india never did materialise and the following year i bore witness to the very bizarre policies of the soviet government with regard to foreign travel by its eminent scientists . and",
    "starobinsky had both been invited to travel to a famous meeting on general relativity ( gr10 ) scheduled in padova , italy in 1983 .",
    "indeed , had been invited to organise a special session on the early universe @xmath82 while starobinsky had consented to give a plenary talk on inflation , which was then a very hot topic .",
    "i too was planning to go since my paper ( written jointly with starobinsky and another of his pupils lev kofman ) had been accepted for presentation .",
    "i was very excited by the prospect of travelling to italy from moscow ( 3 days journey by train passing through several countries ) and the day before leaving i met starobinsky who took me to with the remark `` yakov borisovich here is varun , the only member of our delegation who is sure of travelling to italy '' !",
    "i was not a little surprised to learn that , with only four days remaining for the meeting , neither nor starobinsky had yet received official sanction for their visit .",
    "i was broken hearted when , on reaching padova 4 days later , i learned that neither of my guru s had been allowed to travel , and that the organisers were in a quandary as to how to salvage the early universe session .",
    "what was even more disheartening was the fact that while neither nor starobinsky had been allowed to make the journey to italy ( and showcase soviet science ) , the official soviet delegation was nevertheless replete with scientists , of rather mediocre quality but with deep party connections , who despite their ideological leanings were not ashamed to thoroughly enjoy ` capitalist hospitality ' .    was finally allowed to travel outside of the soviet block in 1982 when , at the age of 68 , he delivered an invited lecture `` remarks on the structure of the universe '' to the international astronomical union in patras , greece . when asked by jerry ostriker , an eminent american astrophysicist , when he was last out of the soviet union , unhesitatingly answered `` sixty eight years ago '' , in a previous life .",
    "viewed in retrospect , and with the demise of the soviet union , it appears quite incomprehensible as to why many of its leading scientists could not travel abroad and enjoy an envigorating science discussion with their contemporaries in the east and west . in s case",
    "this was all the more surprising since his work had gained widespread international recognition and was a foreign member both of the royal society of london and of the u.s .",
    "national academy of sciences .",
    "nevertheless , if the mountain can not come to muhammed then muhammed must go to the mountain , and so the best minds from europe and the u.s .",
    "travelled to the soviet union to meet with and interact with the other eminent scientists belonging to the ` moscow school ' .",
    "so it was that i got the opportunity of listening to inspiring lectures by stephen hawking and subrahmanyan chandrasekhar at special seminars organised by at moscow s sternberg astronomical institute .",
    "it was refreshing to see that , despite his remarkable talents , never pushed ideas simply because they were his own .",
    "i was a witness to this when , on one occasion , after a seminar had formally ended called us back into the auditorium saying there was a ` small idea ' which he wanted to discuss .",
    "the idea turned out to be that of cosmic strings which , having been created during phase transitions in the early universe could , rather remarkably , seed galaxy formation .",
    "this was in 1980 and had just published a paper in the monthly notices of the royal astronomical society describing his scenario .",
    "however , this was also the period when the inflationary scenario was propounded ( independently by alan guth in the us and alexei starobinsky in moscow ) .",
    "was fascinated by inflation , and even though he was not its discoverer , he championed this model enthusiastically @xcite .",
    "when , during 19811982 , it became clear that the rapidly expanding inflationary universe could quantum - mechanically generate the perturbations required to seed galaxies , saw the logical beauty of this approach and abandoned , in the process , his own string - based galaxy formation scenario . perhaps because of this topological defects never did gain popularity in the soviet union , while interest in them thrived for more than two decades in the west ( partly due to the influence of the talented ukrainian emigr alex vilenkin ) .",
    "although worked undoubtedly hard , he was hardly a nerd and thoroughly enjoyed both entertainment and sport ( he had boxed in his youth and loved to swim and ski ) .",
    "he was also very well versed in literature and frequently quoted from writers and poets while lecturing on physics @xmath83 .",
    "his sense of humour was also legendary and he used it abundantly in class , which made his lectures far from boring !",
    "i hope i have been able , within the short span of this article , to communicate to readers of resonance what a remarkable man yakov borisovich really was .",
    "his deep dedication to science combined with great originality and a contagious enthusiasm made him one of the most influential theoretical physicists of the last century .",
    "i would like to end by quoting from andrei sakharov who was a long time colleague and friend of @xcite : `` now , when yakov borisovich zeldovich has departed from us , we , his friends and colleagues in science , understand how much he himself did , and how much he gave to those who had the chance to share his life and work '' .",
