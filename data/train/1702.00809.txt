    "the second uhv recipient is optimized for electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) using an ibach spectrometer.@xcite such experiments were performed on the h - covered gan@xmath0 surface in specular scattering geometry with energies of monochromatic electron beams varying between 5 and 80ev and were repeated after desorption of the hydrogen adsorbates by annealing the sample in uhv at 820@xmath1650k .",

    "fig.[fig : fig_exposure](a ) shows a series of ups ( hei ) valence band spectra during ongoing h and h@xmath1 exposure up to 50l in total .",
    "a gradual shift of the occupied states away from the fermi level @xmath22 at 0ev is observed .",
    "this effect is directly linked to a reduction of the surface band bending , which initially amounts to 0.6ev for the as grown @xmath2-plane gan surface.@xcite in addition , the onset of low - energy secondary electron emission ( not shown ) was shifted , pointing to a reduction of the work function @xmath23 .",

    "the signal intensity of the filled n dangling bond state , initially found at 3.1ev binding energy , is significantly reduced upon the interaction process [ figs.[fig : fig_exposure](a ) and [ fig : fig_pes](d ) ] .",
    "these aspects provide indirect evidence for h adsorption at the gan@xmath0 surface for this second experiment in which the sample was exposed to activated h species .    to prove the observed shift in surface band bending , we have also characterized the core level binding energies using alk@xmath9 x - ray excitation .",
    "the corresponding spectra of the ga2p@xmath25 , n1s and ga3d states are shown in fig.[fig : fig_pes](a)(c ) .",
    "their respective binding energies for the as - grown surface are 1118.0 , 397.7 and 20.1ev .",
    "we emphasize that no surface impurities were detected by xps after the mbe growth or the subsequent h@xmath1 exposure , and therefore the observed changes are not induced by surface impurities , while unfortunately a direct detection and analysis of hydrogen surface species is not possible by xps .",
    "after the performed h exposure , in all cases a shift of the core level binding energy by 0.4ev towards higher values is observed , consistent with the changes observed in the hei spectra during the adsorption process .",
    "these observations indicate that the reaction with the activated hydrogen species results in a saturation of the free dangling bonds at the ga ",
    "n surface .",
    "the impact of the saturation will be discussed in detail in comparison with theoretical predictions below .",

    "a subtraction of contributions from hei satellite lines was applied .",
    "( e ) electronic properties including work function and surface band alignment of the m - plane gan surface with and without adsorbed hydrogen determined based on the results of the photoelectron spectroscopy measurements . ]    in order to analyze the stability or reversibility of the h adsorption process , we have afterwards annealed the sample in ultrahigh vacuum .",
    "while an annealing temperature of 520@xmath1650k did not substantially change the surface electronic properties in terms of band bending and work function indicating a certain stability of the adsorbate structure , heating the substrate up to 820@xmath1650k almost recovered the characteristics after mbe growth .",
    "figs.[fig : fig_pes](a)(d ) include the photoelectron spectra obtained after annealing the hydrogenated surface at 820@xmath1650k for 10min ( black ) .",
    "obviously , the occupied states shift back towards the fermi level and most noticeably , the near vb edge emission from the occupied surface state also recovers in intensity to almost the signal strength after growth [ fig.[fig : fig_pes](d ) ] .",
    "consequently , the hydrogen atoms adsorbed with an effective coverage in the submonolayer regime during the reaction of activated h species and the clean gan@xmath0 surface , can be reversed , i.e. desorption initiated , if sufficient energy is introduced into the system , e.g. thermally induced as examined in this experiment .",
    "fig.[fig : fig_pes](e ) schematically summarizes the experimentally determined differences in electronic properties for the clean and h - covered gan@xmath0 surface including variation in surface band bending and work function .",
    "the aforementioned results indicate a complex interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in hydrogen adsorption / desorption processes : they imply that it is energetically favorable for atomic hydrogen to adsorb at the surface , passivate the ga and n dangling bonds of the clean gan@xmath0 surface and saturate the surface states .",
    "this results in a reduction of the upward band bending by 0.4ev and reduction of the work function by 0.2ev as illustrated in the surface band diagram in fig.[fig : fig_pes](e ) .",
    "however , hydrogen desorption can be mediated at elevated temperatures which can be attributed to the existence of a kinetic barrier .",

    "while pes unraveled changes in the electronic structure upon h adsorption , vibrational spectroscopy was performed to confirm adsorption of atomic h and to identify adsorption sites .",
    "the discovered possibility to saturate the surface by atomic hydrogen , forming a stable adsorbate ( passivation ) layer was used to transfer the h - covered gan samples to a separate uhv chamber . the same heating procedure as used for the pes analysis",
    "was then performed to remove the hydrogen adatoms and to analyze the vibrational characteristics of the gan@xmath0 surface .",
    "figure[fig : fig_eels_sim](a ) shows a representative spectrum measured after transfer of the h - covered gan sample and annealing at 820@xmath1650k in specular scattering geometry and a primary electron energy ( @xmath26 ) of 20ev .",
    "apart from the signature of elastically scattered electrons at 0mev the spectra of the clean surface exhibit almost equidistantly separated loss features .",
    "these peaks are assigned to the spectroscopic signatures of the fuchs - kliewer ( fk ) phonon at ( 88.0@xmath160.4)mev ( average value of eel spectra measured at different @xmath26 ) and its multiple excitations .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by previous findings for gan(0001 ) and gan@xmath27 surfaces @xcite and the simulations to be discussed next .",
    "eels data were simulated using a model which is similar to the theoretical approach developed in refs .. in these calculations , the surface energy - loss function is derived using the continued - fraction expansion method @xcite , when the subsurface region is represented by a finite number of sublayers of certain thickness to reproduce a smooth variation of the depth dependent electron density below the surface . for this purpose ,",
    "electron density depth profiles are computed by solving the schrdinger and poisson equations self - consistently .",
    "it should be noted that the model used for fitting the measured spectra includes only two contributions , originating in collective lattice vibrations ( phonons ) and oscillations of the free - electron gas in the conduction band ( plasmons ) .",
    "also , due to sufficiently low bulk electron density [ see fig.[fig : fig_eels_sim](b ) ] in these samples , the plasmons can manifest themselves only as a small broadening of the elastic peak , in addition to the instrumental resolution ( @xmath33mev for the implemented experimental conditions ) .    the resulting electron density profile from modeling the combined eel spectral data with varying @xmath26 and the associated band edge alignment in the near surface region are depicted in fig.[fig : fig_eels_sim](b ) .",

    "furthermore some important quantitative information can be extracted : the calculations indicate a bulk electron concentration of 5@xmath610@xmath29@xmath30 combined with a depletion layer thickness of @xmath3100 nm .",
    "consequently , these results confirm the low electron concentration in these samples and that pes can be used for the determination of the band bending values since the width of the depletion layer is much larger than the information depth of a few nanometers from the surface obtained in pes . in this region",

    "if these states shift towards or even above the cb edge as calculated for the h - saturated surface , the surface fermi level follows resulting in a reduced upward band bending @xmath28 or even unpins the surface fermi level resulting in flat band conditions . for the performed experiment",
    ", @xmath24 is 0.4ev , indicating a remaining slight upward band bending / electron depletion .",

    "[ fig : fig_thermod ] the difference in the surface free energies is plotted as function of temperature and h@xmath1 pressure .",
    "higher temperatures and/or lower pressures favor the clean surface .",
    "this is attributed to the large translational entropic contributions h@xmath1 molecules have in the gas phase at these conditions . on the other side , at low temperatures and/or high partial pressures",
    "the hydrogen - covered surface is thermodynamically favorable .",
    "more specifically , at 300k and for h@xmath1 pressures larger than @xmath61  bar it is thermodynamically favorable to adsorb hydrogen at the @xmath2-plane gan surface .",

    "furthermore , the annealing experiments indicate that dehydrogenation of the surface , within the time scale of the experiments , requires elevated temperatures as high as 820k .",

    "the contrary , passivation of only cation or anion dangling bonds of one dimer will result in the formation of fully or partially occupied states deep in the gap region .",
    "furthermore , as has already been discussed , surface relaxation and re - hybridization effects result in different atomic geometries for the clean and doubly passivated surface dimers ( see table  [ tbl : tbl ] ) .    as discussed above , bond enthalpies , electronic structure and surface strain",
    "are expected to strongly influence the desorption energies .",
    "thus , they have to be explicitly considered by investigating different atomic hydrogen desorption scenarios .",
    "hence , different desorption mechanisms have been calculated .",
    "these correspond to h desorption from cations and anions at doubly and singly passivated surface dimers in the limit of clean and fully covered surfaces .",

    "the desorption energy is @xmath73  ev .",
    "it should be noted that the aforementioned energy barriers depend weakly on the surface coverage . in the limit of a fully hydrogen - covered surface",
    "the adsorption and desorption energy barriers are @xmath74  ev and @xmath73  ev , respectively .",
    "desorption from two neighboring n or ga surface atoms in the limit of a fully covered surface has higher kinetic barriers , 5.43 and 2.85ev , respectively",
    ". these reaction mechanisms result in single passivated surface dimers and increase both the surface strain and the electronic contributions to the surface energy ( see above ) .",
    "interestingly , the desorption barrier of 0.52ev is remarkably rather small for h@xmath1 binding at two neighboring ga atoms in the limit of a clean surface .",
    "this is because it is highly unfavorable for h to passivate only surface cations even at extreme h - rich conditions . in order that this mechanism can actually take place ,",
    "the h atoms would already have been desorbed from the n surface atoms . however , the latter has considerably higher kinetic barriers .",
    "hence , desorption of molecular hydrogen from neighboring surface cations or anions can be neglected and molecular hydrogen adsorption and desorption is taking place by preferentially binding to and desorbing from ga  n dimers .",
    "the desorption barrier for the hydrogen molecule is considerably smaller than the desorption energy of atomic hydrogen .",
    "hence , desorption is taking place as molecular h@xmath1 rather than as atomic hydrogen . on the other hand for the adsorption of a h@xmath1 molecule",
    ", an energy barrier has to be overcome , while adsorption of atomic hydrogen is barrierless .",
    "thus , if both atomic and molecular hydrogen are present in the gas phase , then surface passivation by hydrogen will preferentially take place through atomic hydrogen adsorption and the rate limiting mechanism will be the flux of incident hydrogen atoms at the surface .",
    "the flux of incident particles at a surface depends on the temperature and the corresponding partial pressure @xmath75 and is given by the hertz - knudsen equation:@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath2 is the mass of the corresponding particles .",
    "for example , for an atomic hydrogen partial pressure of @xmath77  bar at @xmath78  k the flux of incident atomic hydrogen is @xmath79s@xmath80 per 1@xmath61 surface cell area . under these conditions and assuming that hydrogen desorption is kinetically suppressed , 50% or 100% of a monolayer surface coverage of an initially clean surface will be achieved within @xmath81min and @xmath82min , respectively .",
    "in contrast to atomic hydrogen the adsorption of h@xmath1 molecules is not barrierless and the corresponding rate is given by the following equation : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the area of the 1@xmath61 surface unit cell and @xmath85 is the kinetic barrier for adsorption .",
    "it has to be noted here that the sticking coefficient of adsorbing h@xmath1 depends on the orientation as well as the impinging angle of the molecule.@xcite this dependency is not included in the used model .",

    "[ eq : eqhk ] provides an upper limit for the adsorption frequency and hence a lower limit of the time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium .",

    "we have calculated the dynamical matrix of the 4 topmost atomic layers of an 8 layer thick 2@xmath62 slab using the small displacements method for a h@xmath1 molecule ( i ) adsorbed at the surface and ( ii ) at the transition point . the attempt frequency calculated from eq .",

    "the hydrogen surface coverage is given as function of time for different h@xmath1 pressures and temperatures .",
    "( i ) and ( ii ) denote clean and fully covered surface initial conditions , respectively . ]    the temporal evolution of the surface coverage is described by the following rate equation : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the surface coverage and @xmath97 is the time .",
    "equation ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) was solved for i @xmath98 ( clean surface ) and for ii @xmath99 ( fully covered surface ) .",
    "the former starting condition ( i ) corresponds to an adsorption experiment and the latter ( ii ) to a desorption experiment .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_coverage ] the coverage is plotted against exposure time to molecular h@xmath1 for the two aforementioned initial boundary conditions and for various h@xmath1 pressures and temperatures .",
    "a striking finding is that although at h@xmath1 pressures in the order of 2@xmath610@xmath100bar at rt it is thermodynamically favorable to adsorb hydrogen at the surface and the equilibrium coverage is almost 100% , the time scale to achieve 10% or 100% surface coverage is more than a century or a millennium , respectively .",
    "hence , within the time scale of the performed adsorption experiments at rt and partial pressures as low as 10@xmath100bar ( section a ) thermodynamic equilibrium between h@xmath1 gas and the gan@xmath0 surface is kinetically hindered and only atomic hydrogen is able to adsorb quickly and to induce changes in the structural and the electronic surface properties . on the other hand , although the desorption barrier of h@xmath1 is larger than the h@xmath1 adsorption barrier , desorption of molecular hydrogen can take place in considerably shorter time scales .",
    "this can be attributed to ( i ) the higher temperatures applied to dehydrogenate the surface and ( ii ) the considerably larger desorption attempt frequency @xmath87 than the adsorption attempt frequency @xmath101 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhk ] ) ] .",
    "for example , at the aforementioned temperature and pressure , the adsorption attempt frequency @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhk ] ) is 2@xmath610@xmath102s@xmath80 per 1@xmath61 surface cell area as opposed to the desorption attempt frequency of @xmath87=5.6@xmath610@xmath103hz in eq .",

    "[ fig : fig_coverage ] which represents the experimental conditions for the performed experiment of h@xmath1 exposure ) . on the other hand , for the interaction of the clean gan@xmath0 surface with activated atomic h thermodynamic equilibrium between the surface and the offered h species can be established within the time scale of a few minutes even at pressures as low as 10@xmath100 bar .",
    "photoelectron and electron energy loss spectroscopy experiments were combined with first - principles calculations to investigate adsorption and desorption of molecular as well as atomic hydrogen on the nonpolar gan(@xmath104 ) surfaces .",
    "our results show that passivation of the surface cation and anion dangling bonds by hydrogen is thermodynamically favored at room temperature even at hydrogen pressures as low as @xmath105bar .",
    "adsorption of molecular hydrogen is associated with a barrier of 0.55ev , which leads to unrealistically high exposure times to complete a full monolayer . by contrast , only a few minutes of exposure time are required if the clean @xmath2-plane gan surface is brought into an atomic hydrogen atmosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "hydrogen desorption requires elevated temperatures and is predominantly taking place as hydrogen molecules desorbing from surface dimers .",
    "more specifically , our adsorption / desorption experiments confirm that in uhv at room temperature , h - adsorption could only be achieved using atomic hydrogen and desorption starts above @xmath3800k .",
    "the differences in the surface properties of the bare and the h - covered gan(@xmath104 ) surface have been characterized by electron spectroscopy and density functional calculations . stretching and bending vibrations of the h adatoms at the ga ",
    "n surface dimer structure were identified experimentally and are consistent with the energies and dispersion of calculated surface phonon modes .",
    "furthermore , h adsorption was demonstrated to strongly influence the surface electronic properties .",
    "h adatoms occupy the ga and n dangling bonds and induce a shift of occupied and unoccupied surface states out of the gap region across the vbm and cbm , respectively , which influences the surface electron depletion layer .",
    "specifically , the raise of unoccupied intragap surface states from below the cbm for the clean surface to energies above the cbm for the h - covered surface induces an unpinning of the surface fermi level and a reduction of the surface upward band bending from 0.6 to 0.2ev .",
    "these insights demonstrate that chemisorption in a gas exposure experiment or furthermore the probability of impurity incorporation during crystal growth is strongly dependent on the experimental conditions as well as on the energetics and kinetics of the surface dissociation / adsorption reactions at the surface . for other reactions at gan surfaces",
