    "m17sw is a prototypical giant molecular cloud core at a distance of approximately 2.2 kpc @xcite that was first studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the dense core lies adjacent to a large optical h  iiregion and is oriented such that the h  ii  region / molecular cloud interface is viewed nearly edge - on . because of this favorable geometry , this region has been the subject of numerous investigations studying the effect of uv radiation on heating , dissociation , and ionization of the gas within the molecular cloud .",
    "the detection of emission from neutral and ionized fine structure lines of atomic carbon and high - j co lines @xcite well away from the h  iiregion / molecular cloud interface suggests that the uv photons penetrate deep into the m17sw cloud core .",
    "the ability of the uv photons to penetrate into the cloud has been attributed to the clumpy structure of the cloud core .",
    "indirect evidence for a clumpy cloud structure had been previously suggested by @xcite , however high resolution observations of co and cs presented by @xcite reveal more directly the complex structure of this cloud core .    besides studies of the water maser emission at 22 ghz",
    ", only one attempt has been made to detect water in m17sw .",
    "@xcite report a marginal detection of the 183 ghz line of water toward the dense core . with the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( _ swas _ )",
    "we have observed the lowest energy rotational transition of ortho - h@xmath1o  and ortho - h@xmath5o .",
    "these transitions have upper state energies only 27 k above the ortho - water ground state , making observations with _ swas _  a powerful means to probe water in the warm , dense molecular gas of m17sw . in this letter",
    "we present a 17-point map that reveals extended h@xmath1oemission from this region .",
    "observations of the h@xmath5o  transition were made toward the center of the cloud core . based on these observations we estimate the relative abundance of ortho - water in m17sw and compare the results with that found for the extended water emission detected in orion by _ swas _  @xcite .",
    "the observations of h@xmath1o  in m17sw were obtained by _ swas _  during the period 1999 march1999 june and the observations of h@xmath5o  were obtained during 1999 august1999 october .",
    "the data were acquired by nodding the satellite alternatively between m17 and a reference position free of molecular emission .",
    "details concerning data acquisition , calibration , and reduction with _ swas _  are presented in @xcite .",
    "observations of the @xmath7 transition of h@xmath1oat a frequency of 556.936 ghz were obtained at 17 positions in the cloud .",
    "the offsets of the 17 spectra relative to position @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( j2000 ) are given in table 1 .",
    "the absolute pointing accuracy of _ swas _  is better than 5  @xcite .",
    "integration times for these observations were typically 37 hr per position , except the center position which had an integration time of 80 hr . in the opposite receiver sideband of h@xmath1o , we simulataneously obtained spectra of the @xmath3co@xmath10 transition . the center position in m17sw",
    "was also observed in h@xmath5o  at a frequency of 547.676 ghz for nearly 100 hr .",
    "the _ swas _  beam is elliptical , and at the frequency of the water transitions has angular dimensions of @xmath11 .",
    "the data shown in this letter are not corrected for the measured _",
    "swas_main beam efficiency of 0.90 .",
    "we also made use of the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14  m telescope to acquire data for our analysis .",
    "a map of a @xmath12 region was obtained in the @xmath13 transition of @xmath3co  and combined with the lower signal - to - noise ratio map of @xcite , and a map of a @xmath14 region was obtained in the @xmath15 transitions of ch@xmath16cch .",
    "these data are used to provide an estimate of the temperature and column density of the gas for our analysis of the water emission .",
    "sixteen of the seventeen h@xmath1o  spectra were obtained on a 4 by 4 grid with a spacing of 32 .",
    "these spectra , shown in their relative positions on the sky , are presented in figure 1 .",
    "also shown in this figure are spectra of the @xmath10 transition of @xmath3co .",
    "a much larger map of the @xmath10 transition of @xmath3coobtained by _ swas _  is presented in @xcite .",
    "the strongest h@xmath1oemission of 0.38 k was detected toward the map reference position located at the center of the dense core .",
    "the seventeenth spectrum was obtained 64 east and 64 north of the reference position , but no water emission was detected . for the positions where h@xmath1o  was detected , we fit the emission with a gaussian line shape ; the results of this fitting are presented in table 1 . the emission at the center of m17sw is about 5 times weaker than the narrow component of the h@xmath1oemission detected in orion by _ swas _",
    "the h@xmath1o  fwhm line widths vary between 4 and 9 km s@xmath2 and are very similar to those found for cs and co emission in this region @xcite . although the h@xmath1o  spectra appear singly peaked , comparison with @xmath3co@xmath17 spectra ( see fig .",
    "1 ) indicates that in some directions the h@xmath1o  emission may be slightly self - absorbed .",
    "when differences in angular resolution are taken into account , the spatial extent of the h@xmath1o  emission is similar to that found in cs and the lower rotational transitions of c@xmath18o  and @xmath3co  @xcite .",
    "a more direct comparison of the spatial distributions can be made between the h@xmath1o  emission and the @xmath3co  @xmath10 emission obtained simultaneously with _",
    "the results shown in figure 1 reveal a very strong correlation between the emission in these two lines .",
    "the gas probed by the @xmath3co  @xmath10 emission has temperatures in the range 30 to 60 k and densities @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the similarity in emission properties suggests that the h@xmath1o  emission arises from the same warm , dense gas that gives rise to @xmath3co  emission as well as the emission in cs and the lower rotational transitions of co.    figure 2 shows an expanded view of the h@xmath1o  spectra obtained toward the center of the m17sw core along with a spectrum of h@xmath5oobtained in the same direction .",
    "no h@xmath5o  emission was detected . using the same line width and line center velocity determined from a gaussian fit to the h@xmath1o  line at the center",
    ", we fit the h@xmath5oline and set a 3@xmath20 upper limit on the integrated intensity , @xmath21 k km s@xmath2 .",
    "thus the integrated intensity ratio of h@xmath1o / h@xmath5o is @xmath22 22 ( 3@xmath20 ) .",
    "@xcite present an analytical expression for the relative abundance of ortho - water in the low - collision rate or effectively thin limit based on the work of @xcite . for large optical depths , the low - collision rate limit is satisfied if @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the collisional de - excitation rate coefficient , @xmath25 is the line center optical depth , and @xmath26 is the spontaneous emission rate . in this limit ,",
    "the water integrated intensity increases linearly with increasing water column density .",
    "@xcite showed that this limit will be met if the main beam antenna temperature is sufficiently weak , and satisfies    @xmath27    in this limit the line intensity is proportional to the column density of water irrespective of the line optical depth . at a kinetic temperature of 40 k ,",
    "the 557 ghz line of water is effectively thin if the antenna temperature is less than 3.4 k. the maximum observed intensity for the h@xmath1o  emission in m17sw is 0.42 k , after correction for the _ swas _  main beam efficiency .",
    "therefore , unless the area filling factor for the h@xmath1o  emission is much smaller than 0.1 , the h@xmath1o  emission in m17sw is effectively optically thin .",
    "based on the simple analytical expression , we can estimate the water abundance in the m17sw core .",
    "the m17sw core has a density of approximately @xmath28 @xmath29 @xcite , and based on our fcrao @xmath3co  observations , the core has an h@xmath1  column density of @xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the core is estimated to be 50 k based on the analysis of our ch@xmath16cchobservations .",
    "using the main - beam  corrected integrated intensity of the water emission to- to 90.0 mm ward the center of m17sw of 3.6 k km s@xmath2 we estimate the        beam average relative abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  to be @xmath32 . since the dense core in m17sw is large and fills most of the _ swas _  main beam , this abundance estimate should be reasonably accurate .",
    "the determination of the abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  throughout our map requires a more detailed model of the temperature , density , column density , and velocity dispersion of the gas in m17sw .",
    "analysis of our ch@xmath16cch  data yields temperatures of 50 k toward the center of the core , decreasing to 30 k where the ch@xmath16cch  emission became too weak to detect .",
    "these temperatures agree well with those found by @xcite and @xcite . beyond the point where ch@xmath16cch  is detectable , we use the kinetic temperatures derived in @xcite , which were generally in the range of 25 to 45 k. the density studies of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all indicate that the density across the m17sw core is relatively uniform and has a value of @xmath28 @xmath29 .",
    "the dense core is elongated north / south with a long axis of approximately 6  and a short axis of approximately 4 . beyond the core",
    ", we assume the density is @xmath33 @xmath29 based on the analysis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gas column density was derived from the @xmath3co  data assuming lte and a @xmath3co / h@xmath1  abundance ratio of @xmath34 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas along each line of sight was determined from the @xmath3co  line width .",
    "we modeled the h@xmath1o  emission identically to that described in @xcite for the orion cloud core .",
    "we used both the para- and ortho - h@xmath1  collision rates with ortho - h@xmath1o  @xcite and assumed that the ratio of ortho- to para - h@xmath1  is in lte ( which at 40 k implies an ortho - to - para ratio of 0.1 ) .",
    "as in the orion analysis , we do not include the continuum emission from dust ; however , @xcite argue that this will have only a minor impact on the derived water abundance .",
    "the 5 lowest levels of ortho - water are included in our calculations .",
    "we define the physical properties of m17sw on a 44 arcsec grid , much smaller than the _ swas _  resolution .",
    "we proceed by assuming a water abundance , and then compute the emission that would be predicted within the _ swas _  beam .",
    "we then vary the h@xmath1o  abundance until the predicted emission agrees with observations .",
    "thus , for each of the 17 positions we determine the best average h@xmath1o  abundance for the gas that contributes to that _ swas _  observation . for positions with no detections , we used the 3@xmath20 upper limit on the integrated intensity to establish a limit on the h@xmath1o  abundance .",
    "we note that where h@xmath1o  was detected , our model predicts that the emission is optically thick , but effectively thin , although we do not make either assumption in our model .",
    "the results of our abundance analysis are presented in table 1 . with the exception of the region northeast of the core center ,",
    "the abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  relative to h@xmath1  is approximately constant with values between 1 and 2@xmath35 and consistent with our estimates based on the analytical expression .",
    "however , in the three positions in the northeast corner of the map shown in figure 1 , the relative abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  is roughly a factor of 5 larger than that found toward the core .",
    "the region of enhanced h@xmath1oabundance lies toward the interface between the h  ii  region and the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "however since the physical conditions , particularly density and temperature , are not as well known for this region , the abundance determination is more uncertain .    we have also determined the abundance of h@xmath1o  based solely on our observations of h@xmath5o  toward the core center . using the same model described above , we derive a @xmath36 upper limit on the ortho - h@xmath5o  abundance of @xmath37 . assuming a ratio of h@xmath1o / h@xmath5o of 500 ,",
    "provides a @xmath36 upper limit of @xmath38 for the relative abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o .",
    "if our model of the h@xmath1o  line is correct , then the h@xmath5o  line should have an integrated intensity about 20 times smaller than our @xmath36 upper limit , making this line nearly impossible to detect with _",
    "our modeling has ignored several potentially important effects that were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the most important effects are line scattering by an extended halo that might surround the m17sw core , and cloud structure on angular scales much smaller than 44 .",
    "the fact that the emission lines of h@xmath1o  are not strongly self - absorbed and that there is good agreement between the spatial extent of the h@xmath1oemission and that of optically thin tracers of the dense core , provide strong arguments against line scattering being significant in this source .",
    "even if scattering were important for h@xmath1o , the optical depth in the h@xmath5o  line would be 500 times smaller and the effect of line scattering ( in h@xmath5o ) would be negligible .",
    "the m17sw core is known to have substantial structure on a variety of angular scales .",
    "we have assumed that on angular scales less than 44  that the the area filling factor of h@xmath1o - emitting gas is near unity .",
    "if the area filling factor is instead very small , our modeling will underestimate the optical depth of the h@xmath1o  emission and consequently the importance of collisional de - excitation .",
    "however , unless the area filling factor is less than 0.1 , the presence of cloud structure will not impact our determination of the h@xmath1o  abundance .",
    "@xcite estimated that the area filling factor of the gas within m17sw to be greater than unity , well above the limit that would cause concern .",
    "however , regardless of the impact of scattering and unresolved structure on the h@xmath1o  analysis , these effects will be unimportant for h@xmath5o and the non - detection of h@xmath5o  implies that the fractional abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  can not be greater then @xmath38 .",
    "_ swas _  has made the first detection of thermal water emission from m17 sw .",
    "the emission observed by _ swas _  is consistent in line width , line velocity , and spatial extent with the emission arising predominately from the warm dense core gas .",
    "the _ swas _",
    "observations allow us to make the first estimate of the water abundance in this well - studied core .",
    "the average abundance of ortho - h@xmath1o  relative to h@xmath1  in the cloud core is ( 12 )  @xmath35 .",
    "northeast of the core , toward the h  ii  region / molecular cloud interface , the relative water abundance is approximately five times larger .",
    "based on the h@xmath5ospectrum , the @xmath36 upper limit on the relative h@xmath1o  abundance is @xmath38 .",
    "uncertainties in the derived abundance of water are dominated by the uncertainties in the physical conditions primarily density . in the effectively thin limit ,",
    "the abundance of h@xmath1o  is inversely proportional to the density ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , if we had assumed a smaller average density , we would have derived a proportionally higher water abundance .",
    "the study of @xcite concludes that the bulk of the column density toward the m17 core arises in the dense gas .",
    "thus , we believe that uncertainties in the density and density structure can not conspire to increase the water abundance by more than an order of magnitude .    the average relative abundance of water in the m17sw core is 30 times smaller than the average in orion @xcite .",
    "although there is substantial variation in the h@xmath1o  abundance in orion , the abundance is always significantly larger than in the m17sw .",
    "only near the interface with the h  ii  region in m17sw does the abundance of h@xmath1o  approach values found for orion .",
    "the enhanced abundance of water in this interface region could be a result of the evaporation of water - ice  rich mantles from interstellar grains exposed to radiation from the h  ii  region .",
    "further discussion of the chemical implications of these h@xmath1o  abundance results is presented in @xcite .",
