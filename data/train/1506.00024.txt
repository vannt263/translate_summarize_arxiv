    "since the large hadron collider ( lhc ) started its first successful high - energy operations in 2010 , hopes that new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) would appear any moment were running high . with the large accumulated amount of proton - proton data at center - of - mass energies @xmath0 and 8 tev , more and more sophisticated searches for new physics came along . among the theoretical paradigms tested to a great extent are the recent models with extra spatial dimensions , either flat or curved , that appeared about a decade ago and quickly gained a lot of attention from both theoretical and experimental communities .",
    "these models offer a different solution to the infamous  hierarchy problem \" that plagues the sm , and promise an exciting possibility of studying quantum gravity at the lhc , including the most mysterious of its manifestations : the black holes .    in this review ,",
    "the current status of searches for extra spatial dimensions and quantum gravity with the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector at the lhc is presented .",
    "while so far all these searches came empty - handed , several new experimental methods and techniques have been developed , which also apply to other searches for new physics . among these techniques",
    "are an empirical method to predict qcd background in high - multiplicity events from low - multiplicity samples , as well as dedicated methods of reconstructing objects with high lorentz boost , which may be the key signature for discovery of high - mass resonances predicted in a variety of beyond the sm ( bsm ) models , including the extra dimensional paradigm .",
    "the negative results of these searches changed the very way we think about the  naturalness \" ( i.e. non - fine - tuned solutions to the hierarchy problem ) and paved the way to new strategies of looking for these phenomena , which will become possible once the design lhc energy is reached in the next few years .",
    "several models with extra dimensions have appeared in recent years as a follow - up to the original , nearly century - old idea of kaluza and klein ( kk)@xcite to achieve a unification of electromagnetism and gravity by adding a compact fourth spatial dimension . while the kk model did not quite work , huge progress in string theory in the past quarter of century helped to revive the concept of extra dimensions and resulted in the modern attempts to utilize them to solve the hierarchy problem of the standard model , namely the very large ratio between the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and planck energy scales .    among several modern models with extra dimensions , which result in a rich lhc phenomenology",
    ", the following ones have been probed explicitly in the cms experiment :    model with large extra dimensions by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali  @xcite ( add ) . in this model ,",
    "only gravity propagates in @xmath1 flat dimensions assumed to be compactified with a radius @xmath2 either on a sphere or on a torus .",
    "all the sm particles are confined on a 3d membrane (  brane \" ) in the ( 4+n)-dimensional space - time .",
    "apparent weakness of gravity ( i.e. , the large value of the planck mass , @xmath3 ) can then be explained due to the volume suppression of the fundamentally strong gravity in 3+n dimensions ( fundamental planck scale being @xmath4 tev ) , once one looks at its effects in 3 dimensions .",
    "typical values of @xmath1 being considered are between 2 and 6 , with the @xmath5 already being significantly constrained by direct gravitaty measurements at short distances and from astrophysical and cosmological observations.@xcite the radius of extra dimensions depends on their number , and the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath3 can be established via gauss s law:@xcite @xmath7 ( for extra dimensions compactified on a torus ) .",
    "setting @xmath8 tev gives @xmath9 mm ( @xmath10 ) to 1 fm ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these values are _ large _ compared to the characteristic scales of particle physics interactions , hence the name : _ large extra dimensions_.    randall - sundrum ( rs ) model  @xcite with a single ,  warped \" extra dimension , which is realized in five - dimensional anti - desitter space - time ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the metric of the @xmath12 space is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coordinate along the compact dimension of radius @xmath2 , @xmath15 is the curvature of the @xmath12 space , often referred to as the  warp factor \" , @xmath16 are the conventional ( 3 + 1)-space - time coordinates , and @xmath17 is the metric tensor of minkowski space - time . two 3-dimensional branes with",
    "equal and opposite tensions are positioned at the fixed points of the @xmath18 orbifold in the @xmath12 space , at @xmath19 ( sm brane ) and at @xmath20 ( planck brane ) . in this model",
    ", gravity is generated on the planck brane , whereas at least some of the sm particles are confined to the sm brane , separated from the planck brane in the extra dimension .",
    "due to the warping of the extra dimension , operators with the characteristic size of @xmath3 on the planck brane give rise to exponentially suppressed energy scales on the sm brane : @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the reduced planck scale .",
    "thus the ewsb scale can be connected to the planck scale with a relatively low degree of fine tuning by requiring the product of the warp factor and the radius of the compact dimension : @xmath23 . in this model",
    "@xmath2 could have a  natural \" value of @xmath24 , thus offering a rigorous solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "in certain variations of the rs model , some of the sm particles could be displaced w.r.t .",
    "the sm brane ; therefore gravitational coupling may not be universal as it does depend on the geometrical overlap of the graviton and sm particle wave functions in the extra dimension .",
    "universal extra dimensional model  @xcite by appelquist , cheng , and dobrescu . in this model",
    ", all sm particles can travel in @xmath1 extra dimensions and standard constraints from atomic physics and low - energy experiments are avoided by introducing a conserved quantum number , kaluza - klein parity @xmath25  @xcite , which prohibits sm particles ( @xmath26 ) to be directly coupled to an excited kk mode ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this quantum number acts similarly to the r - parity  @xcite in supersymmetric models and ensures that kk excitations can only be produced in pairs , thus significantly weakening many of potential constraints .",
    "typical values of @xmath1 being considered are one and two .    the tev@xmath28 extra dimensional model of dienes , dudas , and gherghetta  @xcite .",
    "in this model , only gauge bosons propagate in an extra dimension with @xmath9 tev@xmath28 , potentially achieving low - energy unification of the strong , electromagnetic , and weak forces .",
    "the phenomenology from the point of view of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time in all these models can be represented by a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of particles propagating in extra dimensions . for compactified extra dimensions ,",
    "such particle could only have quantized values of the momentum projection on the compact dimensions ( cf .",
    "classical  particle in a box \" problem in quantum mechanics ) . from the point of view of a 3d observer , this quantized momentum in the direction orthogonal to the 3d brane appears as a  tower \" of massive states , with the @xmath1-th excitation having a mass of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mass of the zeroth kk mode , representing the ground state , or the particle confined to a 3d brane .",
    ", scaledwidth=95.0% ]    there are three different classes of signatures that can be used to test the predictions of the add model :    _ virtual graviton effects .",
    "_ in the add model , the kk modes of the graviton are very finely spaced in energy , as the size of extra dimensions is large by particle physics standards .",
    "hence , it is experimentally impossible to distinguish between the individual kk states of the graviton , and their spectrum appears to be continuous .",
    "each kk mode couples to the sm particles with the gravitational coupling , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the newton s constant ; since there are many kk modes that can be excited when the momentum transfer is large , the effective gravitational coupling becomes strong and the processes normally transmitted by other gauge bosons , e.g. , drell  yan fermion pair production , can now be also carried via virtual gravitons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dy ] ) .",
    "generally , the graviton - mediated diagrams interfere with their sm counterparts , resulting in a modification of the invariant mass spectrum of the final - state objects , particularly at large masses , for which the amplification of the gravitational interaction due to the a large number of the accessible kk excitations becomes significant .",
    "this modification can be described via an effective field theory ( eft ) approximation , similar to the compositeness operators  @xcite , where the  compositeness scale \" ( i.e. , the eft cutoff ) @xmath33 , is expected to be of order @xmath6 .",
    "the dependence on the number of extra dimensions is predicted to be weak.@xcite    _ direct graviton emission . _ since gravity couples to energy - momentum tensor , any sm feynman diagram vertex can be modified by attaching an extra graviton line to it .",
    "thus , one can take any s - channel production vertex , e.g. , @xmath34 or @xmath35 , and add a graviton to it , resulting in a @xmath36 or @xmath37 process , where a gluon jet is recoiling against the graviton , which escapes in the extra dimensions .",
    "just as in the virtual graviton case , when the momentum transfer is large , the corresponding effective coupling increases and the cross section for this reaction could become sizable .",
    "the signature for such a process in a collider detector is a single jet , countered by a significant missing momentum in the direction transverse to the beam , i.e. a _",
    "monojet_. this is a spectacular signature , quite different from usual sm jet pair production .",
    "similarly , other objects can recoil against the graviton , giving rise to , e.g. , monophoton signature .",
    "the probability of such a process is @xmath38 ( see ref . ) , and thus strongly depends both on the fundamental planck scale and on the number of extra dimensions .",
    "_ black hole production .",
    "_ one of the most spectacular signatures predicted  @xcite within the add model is a possibility to produce microscopic black holes ( bh ) when the collision energy exceeds the value of the fundamental planck scale @xmath6 .",
    "these bhs may act either as their semi - classical counterparts in general relativity and evaporate via thermal hawking radiation of various particle species ; or they may have more complicated properties of their quantum precursors . lacking the full picture of quantum gravity ,",
    "it is impossible to have exact predictions on how these black holes evaporate , so many different possibilities should be considered .",
    "since the hawking temperature is inversely proportional to the schwarzschild radius of such a bh  @xcite , and the bh are tiny , the temperature is very hot and generally speaking the bh is expected to evaporate very fast either thermally ( i.e. , with an emission of a dozen or so particles , each carrying hundreds of gev of energy ) , or via a decay , as a quantum state , into a pair of even more energetic particles . in either case , the signature is quite spectacular and can be also used to probe more general models with low - scale quantum gravity . the terminal stage of bh evaporation is not known .",
    "some models predict that either a stable or unstable remnant with the mass of order of the fundamental planck scale is formed as the evaporating bh mass approaches this planck scale .",
    "in other models it is assumed that thermal evaporation continues to the very end .",
    "virtual graviton effects in cms have been sought in dilepton , diphoton , and dijet data using the invariant mass spectrum of the two produced objects . in both cases ,",
    "the interference with the corresponding sm processes is taken into account .",
    "the dominant background in the mass range of interest is the sm production of dileptons , diphotons , or dijets .",
    "this background , known to next - to - next - to - leading - order ( dileptons ) or next - to - leading - order ( nlo , diphotons , dijets ) precision is reliably estimated from simulation .",
    "no excesses were found in any of the channels . the most stringent limits on @xmath33 come from the dijet data at @xmath39 tev with a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 fb@xmath28 , and reach 8 tev at a 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",

    "direct graviton emission in cms has been probed in the monophoton and monojet channels .    in both cases ,",

    ", the events can pass the signal selections either because the @xmath48 lepton decays hadronically , yielding an extra soft jet in the final state , or leptonically , with the lepton falling below the minimum @xmath47 threshold .",

    "quantum effects and gray - body factors may change the relative fraction of emitted quarks and gluons , but generally it is expected that these particles still appear most often even in the decays of quantum black holes or their precursors , due to a large number of color degrees of freedom that quarks and gluons possess , compared to other sm particles .",
    "the discriminating variable between the signal and the dominating qcd multijet background used in the search is the scalar sum of transverse momenta of all particles in the event , for which the @xmath47 value exceeds 50 gev .",
    "this variable , @xmath54 , was further corrected for any significant  in the event by adding the  value to the @xmath54 variable , if the former exceeds 50 gev . the choice of @xmath54 as the discriminating variable is very robust and rather insensitive to the exact particle content in the process of bh evaporation , as well to the details of the final , sub - planckian evaporation phase .",
    "the addition of  to the definition of @xmath54 further ensures high sensitivity of the search for the case of stable non - interacting remnant with the mass of order of the fundamental planck scale , which may be produced in the terminal stage of the bh evaporation process .",
    "the main challenge of the search is to describe the inclusive multijet background in a robust way , as the bh signal corresponds to a broad enhancement in @xmath54 distribution at high end , rather than a narrow peak .",
    "since the bh signal is expected to correspond to high multiplicity of final - state particles , one has to reliably describe the background for large jet multiplicities , which is quite challenging theoretically , as higher - order calculations that fully describe multijet production simply do not exist .",
    "thus , one can not rely on the monte carlo simulations to reproduce the @xmath54 spectrum correctly .    to overcome this problem , the cms collaboration developed and utilized a novel method of predicting the qcd background directly from collision data .",
    "it has been found empirically , first via simulation - based studies , and then from the analysis of data at low jet multiplicities , that the shape of the @xmath54 distribution for the dominant qcd multijet background does not depend on the multiplicity of the final state , above the turn - on threshold .",
    "this observation , motivated by the way parton shower develops via nearly collinear emission , which conserves @xmath54 , allows one to predict @xmath54 spectrum of a multijet final state using low - multiplicity qcd events , e.g. dijets or three - jet events .",
    "this provides a powerful method of predicting the dominant background for bh production by taking the @xmath54 shape from dijet events , for which the signal contamination is expected to be negligible , and normalizing it to the observed spectrum at high multiplicities at the low end of the @xmath54 distribution , where signal contamination is negligible even for large multiplicities of the final - state objects .",
