    "therefore , higher order modes accumulate near @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , as discussed for the dipolar case , quasi - static expression of the @xmath2 mode polarisability ( eq . [ eq : alpha_n ] ) does not obey energy conservation .",
    "applying the optical theorem , we recently extend the radiative correction to all the spherical particles modes @xcite .",

    "the @xmath2 mode polarisablity can be approximated near resonance .",
    "a simple expression for the polarisability is achieved considering a drude metal : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total decay rate of the @xmath2 mode , that includes both ohmic losses and radiative scattering .",
    "as expected , for a given mode @xmath74 , the radiative scattering rate @xmath75 increases with the particle size since it couples more efficiently to the far - field .",
    "for instance , we obtain @xmath76 ( @xmath77 with @xmath45 ) for the quadrupolar mode of a @xmath37 silver particle in air . as expected , the radiative rate of the quadrupolar is strongly reduced compared to the dipolar mode .",

    "the quadrupolar mode presents a quality factor almost 5 times higher than the dipolar mode since it has limited radiative losses . indeed ,",
    "quadrupolar mode poorly couples to the far - field .",

    "dielectric constant for silver is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=302 ]      last , we express the _ total _ coupling strength of a dipolar emitter to the spherical metallic particle for very short separation distances ( @xmath84 ) @xcite : @xmath85 so that the coupling strength to the @xmath2 mode is easily deduced as @xmath86 where we have used approximated expression ( [ eq : alphanapprox ] ) for the @xmath2 polarisability . the mode effective volume is then straightforwardly deduced from comparison to the purcell factor ( eq .",
    "[ eq : purcell ] ) @xmath87 we obtain for instance quadrupole effective volume @xmath88 for an emitter 10 nm away from a 25 nm radius metallic particle in air .",
    "the calculated effective volumes of the three first modes are shown on figure [ fig : veff ] . at long distance ,",
    "the smaller effective volume ( most efficient coupling to an emitter ) is associated to the dipole mode since it presents the largest extension .",
    "when the emitter - particle distance decreases the coupling strength to the quadrupolar ( @xmath89 ) , then hexapolar ( @xmath90 ) mode becomes stronger as revealed by their lower effective volume .",
    "most efficient coupling between an emitter and one of the particle modes obviously occurs at contact since plasmons mode are confined near the particle surface .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to note that mode effective volume is generally defined independently on the particle - emitter distance so that it gives an estimation of the mode extension .",
    "this is done by evaluating the maximum effective volume available , and for a random emitter orientation . in case of localized spp ,",
    "this is achieved for contact ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "since the decay rate of a randomly oriented emitter expresses @xmath92 , it comes @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the metallic sphere volume and @xmath95 refers to a dipole parallel to the sphere surface ( see eq . [",

    "the expression ( [ eq : veff ] ) , derived for a drude metal , _ quantifies an extremely important property of localized spps ; their effective volume does not depend on the wavelength and is of the order of the particle volume_. metallic nanoparticles therefore support localized modes of strongly subwavelength extension .",

    "[ fig : veff0 ] ) . as a comparison ,",
    "photonics cavity modes are generally limited by the diffraction limit so that their effective volume is at best of the order of @xmath101 ( see ref .",
    "nevertheless , the extremelly reduced spp volume is achieved at the expense of the mode quality factor .",
    "it should be noticed that a low quality factor indicates a large cavity resonance fwhm so that emitter - spp coupling can occur on a large spectrum range .",
    "note that mode effective volume is generally defined by its energy confinement @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "sun and coworkers used this definition and obtained @xcite @xmath102 that is in agreement with our expression for the dipolar mode volume ( @xmath103 ) but leads to slightly different values for other modes ( e.g @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 ) .",
    "recently , koenderink showed that defining the mode volume on the basis of energy density could lead to understimate the purcell factor near plasmonic nanostructures @xcite ( however , he defined the coupling rate to the whole system rather than considering the coupling into a single mode ) .",
    "oppositely , we adopt here a phenomenological approach where the mode volume is defined so that purcell factor remains valid . nevertheless , both methods lead to very similar results for the effective volumes of localized spps supported by a nanosphere . since mode volume is generally a simple way to qualitatively characterize the mode extension , expressions derived here or by sun _",
    "et al _ could be used .",
    "purcell factor quantifies the coupling strength between a quantum emitter and a ( plasmon ) mode but lacks information on the coupling efficiency as compared to all the others emitter relaxation channels . for the sake of clarity",
    ", it has to be mentionned that coupling strength to one spp mode corresponds to the total emission decay rate induced by this coupling .",
    "it does not permit to distinguish radiative ( @xmath107 ) and non radiative ( @xmath108 ) coupling into a single mode .",
    "this could be done by numerically cancelling the imaginary part of the metal dielectric function ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for similar discussion in case of coupling to delocalized spps ) .",
    "however , one can determine the coupling efficiency into a single mode as compared to all others modes .",
    "this coupling efficiency , or the so - called @xmath106factor , is easily estimated in case of a spherical metallic particle since all the available channels are taken into account in the mie expansion .",
    "coupling efficiency into @xmath2 mode writes @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the devay rate of a randomly oriented molecule .",
    "@xmath106factor is represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] for the first three modes .",
    "a maximum efficiency of @xmath111 can be achieved in the dipolar mode ( @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 into quadrupolar mode ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the coupling efficiency into the hexapolar mode is lower ( @xmath115 around @xmath116 ) since it has a very low extension , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : veff0 ] . for very short distances ,",
    "all the coupling efficiencies drop down to zero since all the higher order modes accumulate in this region , opening numerous alternative decay channels .",
    "moreover , it is possible to efficiently couple the emitter to either the dipolar or quadrupolar mode , by matching the emitter and mode wavelengths .",
    "this is of strong importance when designing a spaser ( or plasmon laser ) @xcite so that the active mode can be tuned on the dipolar or quadrupolar mode .",
    "this last _ spasing _ mode would consist of an extremely localized and ultrafast nanosource @xcite .",
    "we explicitly determined the effective volumes for all the spp modes supported by a metallic nanosphere .",
    "their quality factor is also approximated in the quasi - static case or calculated using exact mie expansion .",
    "rather low quality factors ranging from 10 to 100 can be achieved , associated to extremely confined effective volume of nanometric dimensions .",
    "this results in high @xmath4 ratios indicating efficient coupling strength with a quantum emitter . at the opposite to cavity quantum electrodynamics where the coupling strength is obtained on diffraction limited volumes thanks to ultra - high q factors , plasmonics structures allow efficient coupling on nanometric scales with reasonable q factors , defining therefore high - bandwidth interaction .",
    "finally , high coupling efficiencies ( @xmath117 ) to dipolar or quadrupolar mode can be achieved and are of great interest for nanolasers realization .",
