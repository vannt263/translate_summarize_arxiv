    "nowadays the strong interest is springing up to the investigations and measurements of azimuthal correlations in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions ( see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the rescattering and energy loss of hard partons in the azimuthally non - symmetric volume of dense quark - gluon matter , created initially in the nuclear overlap zone in collisions with non - zero impact parameter , can result in the visible azimuthal anisotropy of high-@xmath3 hadrons at rhic  @xcite .",
    "recent anisotropic flow data at rhic  @xcite can be described well by hydrodynamical models for semi - central collisions and @xmath3 up to @xmath4 gev / c ( the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath5 appears to be monotonously growing with increasing @xmath3  @xcite in this case ) , while the majority of microscopical monte - carlo models underestimate the flow effects ( see however  @xcite ) . the saturation and gradual decrease of @xmath5 at relatively large transverse momentum ( @xmath6 gev / c ) , predicted as a signature of strong partonic energy loss in a dense qcd plasma , seem now to be supported by the preliminary data extending up to @xmath7 gev / c at rhic .",
    "the interpolation between the low-@xmath3 relativistic hydrodynamics region and the high-@xmath3 pqcd - computable region was evaluated in  @xcite .",
    "the initial gluon densities in pb@xmath8pb reactions at @xmath9  tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) are expected to be significantly higher than at rhic , implying stronger partonic energy loss . moreover , since at lhc energies the inclusive cross section for hard jet production at @xmath10 gev is large enough to study the impact parameter dependence of such processes  @xcite , one can hope to observe the azimuthal anisotropy for hadronic jet itself  @xcite .",
    "in particular , cms experiment at lhc  @xcite will be able to provide both the jet reconstruction and adequate measurement of impact parameter of nuclear collision using calorimetric information  @xcite . in the case of jets ,",
    "the methodical advantage of azimuthal observables is that one needs to reconstruct only azimuthal position of the jet without measuring its total energy .",
    "it can be done more easily and with high accuracy , while the reconstruction of jet energy is a more ambiguous problem  @xcite .",
    "however the measurement of jet production as a function of azimuthal angle requires event - by - event determination of the nuclear event plane based on the anisotropic flow analysis .",
    "the methods for elliptic flow analysis can be generally divided in two categories : two - particle methods suggested and summarized in works  @xcite and multi - particle methods  @xcite . in two - particle methods",
    "the contribution of non - flow ( non - geometric ) correlations to the determination of the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the measured multiplicity . in multi - particle methods",
    "this contribution goes down typically as @xmath13 , i.e. , smaller by a factor of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "thus experimental techniques based on higher order cumulant analysis should be able in many cases to allow access to the smaller values of azimuthal particle anisotropy in comparison with two - particle methods , due to automatic elimination of the major non - flow many - particle correlations and the systematic errors originating from azimuthal asymmetry of the detector acceptance .",
    "this kind of analysis for particle flow has been already done by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .    in our previous letter",
    "@xcite we proposed the method for measurement of jet azimuthal anisotropy coefficients without direct reconstruction of the event plane , and illustrated its reliability in a real experimental situation .",
    "this technique is based on the calculation of correlations between the azimuthal position of the jet axis and the angles of particles not incorporated in the jet , the azimuthal distribution of jets being described by the elliptic form . to improve our approach , in the given paper",
    "we extend our analysis  @xcite , considering the cumulant expansion  @xcite of multi - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "using eq . ( [ v2 ^ 2_part ] ) and intermediate result in eq .",
    "( [ cor ] ) ( after averaging over particles @xmath26 reduces to @xmath27 ) we derive the formula for computing absolute value of the coefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy ( without reconstruction of sign of @xmath22 ) : @xmath28 this formula does not require the direct determination of reaction plane angle @xmath16 .",
    "the brackets @xmath29 represent the averaging over particles ( not incorporated in the jet ) in a given event , while the brackets @xmath30 are the averaging over events .",
    "the formula ( [ u2_event ] ) can be generalized by introducing as weights the particle momenta , @xmath31 in this case the brackets @xmath29 denote the averaging over angles and transverse momenta of particles .",
    "the other modification of ( [ u2(p)_event ] ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33  being energy deposit in a calorimetric segment @xmath34 of position @xmath35 ) allows one using calorimetric measurements ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) for the determination of jet azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "the main advantage of the higher order cumulant analysis is in the fact that , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , if flow is larger than non - flow correlations , the contribution of the latter to @xmath5 extracted from higher order correlators is suppressed by powers of particle multiplicity @xmath12 in an event .      if now one defines the coefficient @xmath5 of azimuthal anisotropy through two - particle correlator @xmath38 then the contribution of non - flow correlations , as argued in  @xcite , is of order @xmath11 .",
    "while their contribution to @xmath5 , extracted from the fourth order correlator @xmath39)^{1/4},\\ ] ] scales as @xmath13 , i.e. it is suppressed by an extra factor of @xmath40 . corresponding data analysis based on eq .",
    "( [ cum ] ) and result ( [ cum - v_2 ] ) has been already carried out at star  @xcite .",
    "after some algebra the fourth order cumulant ( [ cum ] ) reduces to @xmath58 } & &   c_2[4 ] ~=~ ~v_2 ^ 4~\\frac{1~+~4v_{cor}^{-}/v_2 ^ 2~+~ 2v_{cor}^{-~-}/v_2 ^ 4~+~2v_{cor}^{+}/v_2 ^ 2~ + ~v_{cor}^{+~+}/v_2 ^ 4 } { 1~+~6\\delta~+~3\\delta^2}\\nonumber \\\\ & &    -2v_2 ^ 4~\\left(\\frac{1~+~v_{cor}^{-}/v_2 ^ 2}{1~+~\\delta}\\right)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59    @xmath60   if  @xmath61  is an even function of angular difference @xmath62 .    the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ v2(4 ) ] ) is rewritten in the following form : @xmath63 where the terms  @xmath64   are proportional to  @xmath65   and vanishing after averaging over @xmath66 .    at the first glance it is hard to see the advantage in using higher order cumulants from eqs .",
    "( [ v2_event ] ) , ( [ c_2[4 ] ] ) and ( [ num ] )",
    ". however , it is reasonable to suppose that the contribution of two - particle correlations to the normalization factor @xmath67 is small , @xmath68 , while their `` second fourier harmonic '' @xmath69 can be of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "then _ all _ direct two - particle correlations @xmath69 are automatically _ canceled out _ from eqs .",
    "( [ c_2[4 ] ] ) and ( [ num ] ) in first order in @xmath71 , but are _ survived _ in eq .",
    "( [ v2_event ] ) .",
    "the non - direct two - particle correlations @xmath72 are survived .",
    "but they are suppressed in the comparison with the direct correlations @xmath69 ( contributing to @xmath73 $ ] ) due to the fact that @xmath61 is an even function of angular difference @xmath74 only in most physically interesting cases  @xcite . moreover , for the small - angle @xmath75-like correlations ( @xmath76 ) and for the large - angle oscillating ones ( @xmath77 ) the non - direct correlations @xmath72 are equal to zero . then @xmath78~=\\bigg\\langle\\frac{num}{(-c_2[4])^{3/4 } } \\bigg\\rangle_{event}~\\simeq~ v_2^{jet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case , while @xmath79 ~\\simeq~v_2^{jet}~ \\sqrt { \\frac{1}{1~+~v_{cor}^{-}/v_2 ^ 2}}~.\\ ] ] thus eqs .",
    "( [ v2(4 )  ] ) and ( [ v2_event  ] ) demonstrate the better accuracy of higher order cumulants explicitly .",
    "in order to illustrate the applicability of the method presented with regard for the real physical situation , we consider the following model ( see ref .  @xcite for details ) .    * the model *    the initial jet distributions in a nucleon - nucleon sub - collision at @xmath80 tev",
    "have been generated using pythia@xmath81  @xcite .",
    "we simulated the rescattering and energy loss of jets in gluon - dominated plasma , created initially in the nuclear overlap zone in pb@xmath8pb collisions at different impact parameters .",
    "for details of this approach one can refer to refs .",
    "essential for our consideration here is that in non - central collisions the azimuthal distribution of jets is approximated well by the elliptic form ( [ phi_jet ] ) . in the model",
    "the coefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy increases almost linearly with the growth of impact parameter @xmath82 and becomes maximum at @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the nucleus radius . after that @xmath54 drops rapidly with increasing @xmath82 :",
    "this is the domain of impact parameter values , where the effect of decreasing energy loss due to reducing effective transverse size of the dense zone and initial energy density of the medium is crucial and not compensated anymore by stronger non - symmetry of the volume .",
    "the kinematical cuts on jet transverse energy and rapidity has been applied : @xmath85 gev and @xmath86 .",
    "after this the dijet event is superimposed on the pb@xmath8pb event containing anisotropic flow .",
    "anisotropic flow was generated using the simple hydrodynamical monte - carlo code  @xcite giving hadron ( charged and neutral pion , kaon and proton ) spectrum as a superposition of the thermal distribution and collective flow . to be definite , we fixed the following `` freeze - out '' parameters : the temperature @xmath87 mev , the collective longitudinal rapidity @xmath88 and the collective transverse rapidity @xmath89 .",
    "we set the poisson multiplicity distribution and took into account the impact parameter dependence of multiplicity in a simple way , just suggesting that the mean multiplicity of particles is proportional to the nuclear overlap function .",
    "we also suggested  @xcite that the spatial ellipticity of the `` freeze - out '' region is directly related to the initial spatial ellipticity of the nuclear overlap zone .",
    "such `` scaling '' allows one to avoid using additional parameters and , at the same time , results in the elliptic anisotropy of particle and energy flow due to the dependence of effective transverse size of the `` freeze - out '' region on the azimuthal angle of a `` hadronic liquid '' element .",
    "obtained in such a way azimuthal distribution of particles is described well by the elliptic form ( [ phi_part ] ) for the domain of reasonable impact parameter values .    to be specific ,",
    "we consider the geometry of cms detector  @xcite at lhc . the central ( `` barrel '' )",
    "part of the cms calorimetric system covers the pseudo - rapidity region @xmath90 , the segmentation of electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters being @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively  @xcite . in order to reproduce roughly the experimental conditions ( not including real detector effects , but just assuming calorimeter hermeticity ) , we applied eqs .",
    "( [ u2(e)_event ] ) and ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) to the energy deposition @xmath93 of generated particles , integrated over the rapidity in @xmath94 segments ( according to the number of segments in the hadron calorimeter : @xmath95 ; @xmath96 ) covering full azimuth .",
    "note that in the cms heavy ion physics program , the modified sliding window - type jet finding algorithm has been developed to search for `` jet - like '' clusters above the average energy , and to subtract the background from the underlying event  @xcite . strictly speaking , after jet extraction the background energy deposition in the calorimetric cells should be redefined and can appear to be not exactly equal to the initially generated one",
    ". however we neglect this effect here . in a real experimental situation , in order to avoid the influence of jet contribution on the particle flow , one can consider jets and particles incorporated in the energy flow analysis in different rapidity regions .    * numerical results *    we have found  @xcite that the accuracy of @xmath22 determination from eq .",
    "( [ u2(e)_event ] ) is close to @xmath97 for semi - central ( @xmath98 ) collision and becomes significantly worse in very peripheral collision ( @xmath99 ) , wherein decreasing multiplicity and azimuthal anisotropy of the event results in relatively large fluctuations of energy deposition in each segment .    in the given paper",
    "we test the efficiency of the higher order correlator ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) and have found , at first , that the results for @xmath54 obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ u2(e)_event ] ) and ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) are practically the same .",
    "this is explained by the fact that our simple monte - carlo event generator gives the elliptic anisotropy of energy flow , correlated with the reaction plane , but no correlations between energy deposition in the calorimeter segments .",
    "we can introduce such correlations at the calorimetric level `` by hand '' , simply assuming that the probability of finding the energy @xmath100 in a segment @xmath34 and the energy @xmath101 in a segment @xmath102 is proportional to @xmath103 , where the `` correlation strength '' @xmath104 may be , for example , proportional to @xmath105 ( the short - range @xmath75-like correlations ) or @xmath106 ( the long - range oscillating correlations ) . in this case",
    "we became convinced that the higher order cumulant ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) was almost independent of such correlations ( as it was shown in sect .",
    "4 ) , while the result of calculation ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) changed , closely following the formula ( [ v2_event  ] ) corrected by autocorrelation terms which are non - vanishing in finite summation  @xcite .",
    "we have also found at the calorimetric level that , taking into account the effect of possible detector inefficiency ( i.e. that the particles and jets are not detected in a `` blind '' azimuthal sector of size @xmath107 ) , the accuracy of @xmath54 determination appears to be less than @xmath108 at @xmath109 in our model calculation without correlations and at @xmath110 , whichever algorithm ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) or ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) we used .",
    "fig.1 is presented to illustrate the improvement due to the fourth order cumulant method in the determination of jet azimuthal anisotropy @xmath22 depending on the ratio @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the coefficient of elliptic azimuthal anisotropy of energy flow defined here as @xmath113 and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the maximum and minimum energy deposit in a segment respectively ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath116 determines the `` correlation strength '' at the calorimetric level , @xmath117 for short - range correlations ) .",
    "this can result in the smaller value of the ratio @xmath111 in comparison with the ratio @xmath118 ( and , as consequence , in a somewhat less improvement due to the higher order method at the calorimetric level ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) in comparison with the particle level ( [ v2(4 ) ] ) ) .",
    "we still have no any adequate monte - carlo generator for particle flow effects at lhc including the physical model for correlations .",
    "thus we can not estimate the real value of @xmath111 ( true benefit from the higher order method ) and just treat it here as a phenomenological parameter . ]",
    "( the similar result is obtained for long - range correlations with @xmath119 ) .",
    "the plots show the @xmath82-dependence of the `` theoretical '' value of @xmath22 ( calculated including collisional and radiative energy loss when the reaction plane angle is known in each event ) , and the @xmath22 determined by the methods ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) and ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) for the three ratios @xmath120 .",
    "we used two values of the input parameter , the number of charged particles per unit rapidity at @xmath121 in central pb@xmath8pb collisions : @xmath122 ( fig.1a ) and @xmath123 ( fig.1b ) .",
    "one can see that improvement due to the fourth order cumulant method ( result of ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) is independent of @xmath111 and coincides with the result of ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) for @xmath124 ) is pronounced for more peripheral collisions , smaller particle multiplicities and larger `` correlation strengths '' .",
    "in the present paper we have analyzed the method for measurements of jet azimuthal anisotropy coefficients without reconstruction of the event plane considering the higher order correlators between the azimuthal position of the jet axis and the angles of particles not incorporated in the jet .",
    "the method is generalized by introducing as weights the particle momenta or the energy deposit in the calorimeter segments . in the latter case",
    ", we have illustrated its reliability in the real physical situation under lhc conditions .",
    "introducing in the model correlations between energy deposits in the calorimeter segments does not practically change the accuracy of the method using fourth order cumulant calculations ( [ v2e(4 ) ] ) , while the result obtained with second order correlator ( [ u2(e)_event ] ) is dependent significantly of the `` strength '' of such correlations .",
    "the advantage of the higher order cumulant analysis is pronounced for more peripheral collisions and smaller particle multiplicities .",
