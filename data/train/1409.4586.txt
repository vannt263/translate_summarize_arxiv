    "<S> we study occupation time statistics in ergodic continuous - time random walks . under thermal detailed balance conditions , the average occupation time is given by the boltzmann - gibbs canonical law . </S>",
    "<S> but close to the non - ergodic phase , the finite - time fluctuations around this mean are large and nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> they exhibit dual time scaling and distribution laws : the infinite density of large fluctuations complements the lvy - stable density of bulk fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> neither of the two should be interpreted as a stand - alone limiting law , as each has its own deficiency : the infinite density has an infinite norm ( despite particle conservation ) , while the stable distribution has an infinite variance ( although occupation times are bounded ) . </S>",
    "<S> these unphysical divergences are remedied by consistent use and interpretation of both formulas . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , while the system s canonical equilibrium laws naturally determine the mean occupation time of the ergodic motion , they also control the infinite and lvy - stable densities of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the duality of stable and infinite densities is in fact ubiquitous for these dynamics , as it concerns the time averages of general physical observables . </S>"
