    "let @xmath8 stand for the set of all triangulations of @xmath7 .",
    "the problem of computing the number of triangulations of @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath9 , is easy when @xmath7 is convex . simply , by a straightforward recurrence , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath12-th catalan number , in this special case .",
    "however , in the general case , the problem of computing the number of triangulations of @xmath7 is neither known to be @xmath13-hard nor known to admit a polynomial - time counting algorithm .",
    "it is known that @xmath9 lies between @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "since the so called flip graph whose nodes are triangulations of @xmath7 is connected  @xcite , all triangulations of @xmath7 can be listed in exponential time by a standard traversal of this graph .",
    "only recently , alvarez and seidel have presented an elegant algorithm for the number of triangulations of @xmath7 running in @xmath5 time  @xcite which is substantially below the aforementioned lower bound on @xmath9 ( the @xmath16 notation suppresses polynomial in @xmath0 factors ) .    also recently ,",
    "alvarez , bringmann , ray , and seidel  @xcite have presented an approximation algorithm for the number of triangulations of @xmath7 based on a recursive application of the planar simple cycle separator  @xcite .",
    "their algorithm runs in subexponential @xmath17 time and over - counts the number of triangulations by at most a subexponential @xmath18 factor .",
    "it also yields a subexponential - time approximation scheme for the base of the number of triangulations of @xmath7 , i.e. , for @xmath19 .",
    "the authors of  @xcite observe also that just the inequalities @xmath20 yield the large exponential approximation factor @xmath21 for @xmath9 trivially computable in polynomial time .",
    "we take a similar approximation approach to the problem of counting triangulations of @xmath7 as alvarez , bringmann , ray , and seidel in  @xcite .",
    "however , importantly , instead of using recursively the planar simple cycle separator  @xcite , we apply recursively the so called balanced @xmath22-cheap @xmath23-cuts of maximum independent sets of triangles within a dynamic programming framework developed by adamaszek and wiese in  @xcite . by using the aforementioned techniques , the authors of  @xcite designed the first quasi - polynomial time approximation scheme ( qptas ) for the maximum weight independent set of polygons belonging to the input set of polygons with poly - logarithmically many edges .",
    "observe that a triangulation of @xmath7 can be viewed as a maximum independent set of triangles drawn from the set of all triangles with vertices in @xmath7 that are free from other points in @xmath7 ( triangles , or in general polygons , are identified with their open interiors ) .",
    "this simple observation enables us to use the aforementioned balanced @xmath22-cheap @xmath23-cuts recursively in order to bound an approximation factor of our approximation algorithm .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 specifies the maximum fraction of an independent set of triangles that can be destroyed by the @xmath23-cut , which is a polygon with at most @xmath23 vertices in a specially constructed set of points of polynomial size .",
    "similarly as the approximation algorithm from  @xcite , our algorithm may over - count the true number of triangulations because the same triangulation can be be partitioned recursively in many different ways . in contrast with the approximation algorithm in  @xcite , our algorithm may also under - count the number of triangulations of @xmath7 , since our partitions generally destroy a fraction of triangles in a complete triangulation of @xmath7 .",
    "our approximation algorithm for the number of triangulations of a set @xmath7 of @xmath0 points with integer coordinates in the plane runs in @xmath24 time . for @xmath25 , it returns a number at most @xmath26 times smaller and at most @xmath26 times larger than the number of triangulations of @xmath7 .",

    ", we obtain a quasi - polynomial approximation scheme for the base of the number of triangulations of @xmath7 , i.e. , for @xmath19 .",

    "the maximum weight independent set of polygons problem ( mwisp ) is defined as follows  @xcite .",
