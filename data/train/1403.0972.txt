    "bimolecular recombination is one of the key loss mechanisms in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells , especially in thicker devices or those made from materials which do not possess a sufficiently high carrier mobility@xcite .",
    "recombination coefficients are commonly compared with the prediction of langevin @xcite , i.e. @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the charge of an electron , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the mobility of holes ( electrons ) , and @xmath5 is the dielectric permittivity .",
    "a suppressed , non - langevin recombination coefficient ( with @xmath6 ) has been reported in organic photovoltaic blends that exhibit high performance @xcite .",
    "suppressed recombination is desirable to ensure efficient charge extraction .",
    "the reduction factor @xmath7 is a useful `` figure of merit '' for screening candidate photovoltaic blends to rapidly identify those which are likely to be highly performing @xcite .",
    "a variety of techniques are available to study recombination dynamics .",
    "techniques that operate on fully operational devices ( i.e. those without blocking layers or other modifications@xcite ) include transient photovoltage ( tpv ) @xcite , photogenerated charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage ( photo - celiv ) @xcite , and time - of - flight ( tof ) @xcite .",
    "tpv studies often show an apparent reaction order higher than the expected value of two @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this is due to a concentration dependence in the recombination coefficient @xcite , recombination through trap states@xcite , or the spatial separation of the carriers under open circuit conditions @xcite .",
    "the spatial separation at open - circuit conditions can be reduced by studying the solar cell nearer to short - circuit conditions , as in the photo - celiv or tof experiments .",
    "photo - celiv can be used to study charge carrier mobility and also the bimolecular recombination coefficient @xcite .",
    "the recombination coefficient can be estimated from the maximum extraction current in the photo - celiv transient@xcite . however",
    ", this transient is influenced by experimental factors that are not fully accounted for in the theory , such as the spatial distribution of light absorption@xcite , the circuit resistance@xcite , and the voltage slope@xcite .",
    "additionally , premature escape of charge from the film@xcite contributes to the charge redistribution during the delay time@xcite , which results in a false position of the extraction maximum and makes the measurement unreliable .",
    "while some attention has been directed to minimizing this issue@xcite , a full compensation of carrier redistribution is impossible due to fermi level pinning , an inhomogeneous electric field inside the film and strong diffusion near the electrode where carriers are photogenerated .",
    "another well known technique to characterise recombination is high intensity time - of - flight ( tof)@xcite . the recombination coefficient can be estimated from the amount of charge extracted during a tof experiment@xcite .",
    "however , the external circuit resistance influences the extracted charge@xcite , making the measurement unreliable due to its dependence on the experimental conditions .",
    "previous works have neglected the impact of the @xmath8 circuit @xcite . here",
    ", we resolve this issue by extending the previous work to achieve more reliable experimental results .    in this article",
    ", we study recombination in the benchmark organic photovoltaic system pcdtbt : pc71bm ( see the experimental section for details of the materials ) .",
    "we quantify the recombination in this system , and compare solar cells made with low molecular weight pcdtbt to those made with high molecular weight pcdtbt .",
    "our recombination study will be conducted using a variant of time - of - flight that we call high intensity resistance dependent photovoltage ( hi - rpv ) .",
    "an exact analytic solution of the relevant differential equations is not known , so we apply numerical simulations to show the applicability of the technique to a variety of experimental conditions @xcite",
    ". the details of our numerical solver are presented in appendix a. after demonstrating the generality of the technique , we go on to apply it to operational bulk heterojunction solar cells .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in figure [ fig : circuit - schematic ] . similarly with time - of - flight , charges are photogenerated using a high intensity laser , and the voltage across the load resistor is measured with an oscilloscope .",
    "however , in contrast with traditional time - of - flight , the measurement is repeated many times across a wide range of load resistances . furthermore , volume photogeneration is desirable , and consequently operational thin - film solar cells can be studied .",
    "the experiment begins with the photogeneration of a large quantity ( @xmath9 ) of charge carriers using an intense laser pulse .",
    "these carriers induce a photocurrent that charges the electrodes , which act as capacitive plates .",
    "the electrodes rapidly acquire a charge of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the capacitance and @xmath12 is the solar cell s built in field ( or the applied voltage ) .",
    "next , two processes occur simultaneously .",
    "the first is the recombination of the photogenerated charges , and the second is the discharge of the capacitor through the external @xmath8 circuit .",
    "if the @xmath8 time is large , then the photocarriers will completely recombine before the capacitor can discharge .",
    "regardless of the nature of the recombination , one can always find a resistance @xmath13 large enough that the @xmath8 time greatly exceeds the lifetime of charge carriers .",
    "consequently , in the limit of large @xmath13 , the extracted charge will be limited to @xmath10 .",
    "conversely , if the @xmath8 time is small , then the capacitor will discharge before the carriers completely recombine , more photocurrent will flow , and the extracted charge will exceed @xmath10 . in the intermediate regime , there is an interplay between the bimolecular lifetime and the @xmath8 time .",
    "we exploit this relationship in order to quantify the carrier recombination .",
    "circuit schematic for the high intensity resistance dependent photovoltage ( hi - rpv ) experiment .",
    "current transients are recorded across a range of load resistances , and then integrated to obtain the extracted charge , @xmath14 .",
    "the variation in the extracted charge with resistance is used to quantify the recombination processes and determine the bimolecular recombination coefficient .",
    "if the device under test is an operational solar cell , then the dc voltage supply is optional and the experiment can be done under the solar cell s built - in field . ]",
    "the simulated impact of light intensity and the optical absorption ( or photogeneration ) profile is shown in figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_alpha ] .",
    "we applied the beer - lambert law to represent the photogeneration profile , @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the initial concentration of electrons ( holes ) , @xmath18 is the light intensity in photons per unit area , @xmath19 is the absorption coefficient at the laser wavelength , and @xmath20 is the spatial coordinate .",
    "the other simulation settings are given in appendix b.    the impact of the film thickness and light absorption profile on the extracted charge .",
    "the film thickness is incorporated within the absorption - thickness product @xmath21 ( where @xmath19 is the absorption coefficient and @xmath22 the thickness ) .",
    "the inset shows the @xmath21 dependence in the region indicated by the thin grey box ( @xmath23 ) , and demonstrates that the extracted charge is independent of the initial carrier distribution for thin films ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the extracted charge readily saturates with high light intensity .",
    "this graph shows that a general theory for thin film devices can be developed , without detailed optical modelling , and without regard for the precise quantity of photogenerated carriers in the saturation regime . ]",
    "figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_alpha ] shows that the extracted charge @xmath25 becomes essentially independent of @xmath21 when @xmath21 is less than 1 , where @xmath22 is the device thickness .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_alpha ] shows the @xmath21 dependence at high light intensity , demonstrating that @xmath25 is essentially insensitive to the initial carrier spatial distribution , in the case of volume generation .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath26 ( see figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_alpha ] ) , the light intensity at the back of the device is approximately 5% of the light intensity at the front of the device .",
    "such a strong inhomogeneity in the spatial distribution does not meaningfully affect the extracted charge .",
    "physically , the insignificance of the initial spatial distribution is caused by bimolecular recombination .",
    "the bimolecular recombination process will be more rapid in regions of higher light intensity , and slower in regions of lower light intensity .",
    "this will , in effect , `` smooth '' the carrier distribution across the device , erasing the initial spatial distribution .",
    "more precisely , the carrier concentration at early times is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath16 is the initial carrier concentration @xcite .",
    "in the limit of very large @xmath16 , the dependence on the initial condition vanishes [ @xmath28 .",
    "this explains why the absorption profile is irrelevant at high light intensities .    in summary , to first order , detailed optical modelling to account for exact carrier distribution in operational solar cells",
    "is not necessary , since the precise spatial distribution of carriers is rapidly erased by bimolecular recombination .",
    "therefore , the hi - rpv technique can be applied to thin film devices ( @xmath29 ) without concern for optical interference .",
    "since the technique is insensitive to the light absorption profile , we will remove @xmath21 from the set of parameters being tested , and approximate the initial condition by perfectly uniform carrier generation .",
    "all subsequent numerical calculations are performed with this simplified uniform initial condition , rather than the beer - lambert law .",
    "the impact of the circuit resistance on the extracted charge from simulated resistance dependent photovoltage experiments . filled symbols with lines show balanced mobilities ( @xmath30 ) ; open symbols without lines show strongly unbalanced mobilities ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the two are very similar , because the normalisation scale for the circuit @xmath8 time minimises the effect of the mobility ratio .",
    "the saturation value @xmath32 depends almost entirely upon the normalised resistance .",
    "these results demonstrate that the load resistance needs to be accounted for to correctly measure the recombination coefficient . ]    in a hi - rpv experiment , the circuit resistance is varied over many orders of magnitude in order to observe the dynamical interaction between the known circuit @xmath8 time and the unknown bimolecular lifetime .",
    "we examined the impact of the circuit resistance using our simulations , as shown in figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] .",
    "importantly , we observe that more charge can be extracted at lower resistances .",
    "a smaller resistance allows the charge extraction to complete in a shorter time , so that less recombination occurs , and the overall extracted charge is higher .",
    "the faster carrier mobility is normalised out of the simulation by the system of units ( as described in appendix a ) .",
    "however , it is necessary to specify the ratio of carrier mobilities @xmath33 . to confirm that variation in this ratio",
    "will not interfere with the measurement , figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] shows the case of balanced mobilities ( @xmath30 ) with filled symbols and lines and strongly unbalanced mobilities ( @xmath31 ) with open symbols and no lines .",
    "this covers a wide range of mobility ratios to examine the variation that might be expected to occur in practice .",
    "the two cases ( balanced mobilities and strongly unbalanced mobilities ) are essentially indistinguishable , as shown in figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] .",
    "we explain this insensitivity as follows .",
    "the amount of extracted charge @xmath14 is primarily controlled by the recombination .",
    "the langevin recombination rate is proportional to the _ sum _ of carrier mobilities .",
    "the relevant time scale for this process is @xmath34 .",
    "figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] shows that the extracted charge saturates at high light intensities to a value that we call @xmath35 , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "therefore , if the hi - rpv experiment is operated in this saturation regime , the amount of extracted charge does not depend on the laser power which is applied .",
    "the extracted charge is also independent of the carrier mobility ratio ( figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] ) and the light absorption profile ( figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_alpha ] ) .",
    "consequently , the only parameters remaining to be quantified are the circuit resistance and the bimolecular recombination coefficient .",
    "simulations of the impact of load resistance on the extracted charge from thin film devices with langevin recombination at varying mobility ratios .",
    "points are calculated from simulations at high light intensity ( @xmath36 , although the precise value is unimportant because of the saturation in the extracted charge @xmath14 , as shown in figure [ fig : qe_vs_l_varying_r ] ) .",
    "the ratio of carrier mobilities does not affect the extracted charge , so hi - rpv measurements can be applied equally to systems with balanced mobilities and systems with strongly unbalanced mobilities . ]",
    "the impact of the circuit resistance is shown in figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] .",
    "if the normalised resistance is small , the extracted charge @xmath37 can exceed the charge on the electrodes @xmath10 by an order of magnitude or more , even in the presence of langevin recombination .",
    "the tof experiment under these circumstances is therefore misleading , especially if comparing two systems with different values of the normalised resistance , @xmath38 .",
    "we resolve this problem by introducing the hi - rpv technique .",
    "we firstly develop predictions for langevin systems , and then in the following section extend this to the general case .",
    "figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] shows a single universal curve that all langevin systems should obey .",
    "we developed an empirical equation to describe this curve by arbitrarily choosing an appropriate functional form that would give a logarithmic dependence at small @xmath13 ( as shown in figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] ) , and would saturate to 1 at large @xmath13 ( as also shown in figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] ) , @xmath39.\\label{eq : qesat(r)_general}\\ ] ] we used non - linear least squares regression to calculate the coefficients @xmath40 from the simulation results in figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] .",
    "the result is :    @xmath41,\\label{eq : qesat(r)_langevin}\\ ] ]    which is valid for langevin recombination and thin films .",
    "equation ( [ eq : qesat(r)_langevin ] ) is plotted against the simulation results in figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] , demonstrating excellent agreement .    the purpose of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qesat(r)_langevin ] ) is to determine the type of recombination present in a thin film device ; for example , one could plot this equation alongside measured data in order to determine whether the recombination is of the langevin type .",
    "this is important , since recombination orders higher than two have been experimentally observed @xcite , and it is necessary to identify the type of recombination dynamics that might apply to the system being studied . a plot of extracted charge versus resistance ( figure [ fig : qesat(r)_sims ] ) will follow the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qesat(r)_langevin ] ) if langevin recombination is dominant .",
    "in contrast , if there is a higher order of recombination , then the carrier concentration will decay according to a different time dependence , and the functional form of the extracted charge versus resistance will change . if the recombination is stronger than langevin , the experimental data will lie _ below _ the line . on the other hand ,",
    "if the dominant form of recombination is slower than langevin , then less recombination will occur and the experimental data will lie _ above _ the line",
    ".    we will show below that our experimental data can be described by a bimolecular recombination process with a langevin reduction prefactor .",
    "we do not exclude the possibility of higher - order effects such as a concentration - dependent recombination coefficient @xcite , but these are not necessary to explain our data .",
    "therefore , in the following section , we extend our theory to systems with suppressed ( non - langevin ) recombination of purely second order .",

    "this approach is valid for any thin film ( @xmath24 ) device .",
    "importantly , this technique is not hindered by the rc - dependence that affects traditional high intensity tof @xcite , because the impact of the @xmath8 time constant on the extracted charge is accounted for on the horizontal axis of figure [ fig : qesat(r , beta)_sims ] .",

    "the einstein relation for diffusion gives a dimensionless temperature @xmath72 .",
    "the recombination coefficient is normalised to the langevin rate : @xmath73 .",
    "the model equations for the semiconductor bulk are : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76    the boundary conditions for poisson s equation are : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the voltage across the semiconductor : @xmath79    the boundary conditions for the number density are as follows .",
    "we use a finite volume method , so the boundary conditions for the transport equations are expressed in terms of the fluxes @xmath80 and @xmath81 at each electrode . since the rpv experiment is conducted under reverse bias , we assume no injection is possible .",

    "the spatial discretisation of these equations was performed using the finite volume method .",
    "number densities are defined at cell midpoints , whereas the fluxes and the electric field are defined on the cell boundaries .",
    "this results in a large system of coupled odes in time .",
    "we implemented these in matlab , and found that the _ ode15s _ solver usually provides the best performance out of all the standard matlab ode solvers .",
