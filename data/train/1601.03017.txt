    "a dynamical system @xcite is a pair @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a compact metric space and @xmath6 a continuous map @xmath7 . in this article",
    "we introduce a generic map for nonlinear dynamical systems @xmath8 where @xmath6 is discontinuous .",
    "however , as we explicitly show , discontinuity can be seen here as arising from the discretization ( shadowing ) of any arbitrary specific continuous dynamics as governed by an arbitrary non - autonomous map .",
    "some advantages of our formulation become evident , as soon as it is realized that the mathematical method presented allows each digit of any numerical quantity to be individually addressed . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the temporal evolution that constitutes the output of the map can be mathematically designed in detail _ a priori _ through its few control parameters .",
    "we find , for example , that the specific shape of any regular oscillations on an attracting limit cycle can be mathematically engineered .",
    "the method also allows the design / modeling of time series with irregular or aperiodic waveforms .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section [ digit ]",
    "we introduce the mathematical tools , the digit function and the replacement operator , in which our approach is based .",
    "then , we show how to convert any arbitrary non - autonomous map into the generic map that is the object of our study ( see eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) below ) . in section [ maphor ]",
    "we discuss in detail its dynamics , providing explicit solutions for the orbits of the map .",
    "our discussion culminates in a model for aperiodic nonchaotic attractors , showing how they can be constructed in phase space , all attractors sharing aspects of the same qualitative dynamics ( even when they can be made distinguishable ) .",
    "we prove that , in spite of the dynamics on the attractors being aperiodic , the lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "since our approach is based on the possibilities opened by a digit function that we have recently discussed in connection with fractals @xcite and cellular automata @xcite we first introduce this function .",
    "let @xmath1 be a natural number called the _ radix_. any arbitrary real number @xmath9 can be represented in radix @xmath2 as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the digit function , defined as @xcite @xmath12 and where the brackets @xmath13 denote the floor ( lower closest integer ) function . as an example , in the decimal radix @xmath14 , the number @xmath15 has digits @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 etc .",
    "trivial properties of the digit function that can be directly checked from its definition are the @xmath21 periodicity @xmath22 and the scaling property @xmath23 the reader is referred to @xcite for other properties of the digit function and a detailed discussion / derivation of them .",
    "in this paper we shall consider @xmath24 a non - negative integer . in this case",
    "@xmath25 , i.e. the zeroth digit function of an integer number is equal to that number modulo the radix @xmath2 .",
    "we then observe that @xmath26    the number @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ iden ] ) is the maximum exponent of the power of the radix with which @xmath28 is represented in radix @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite thus , the function @xmath27 gives the _ order of magnitude _ of @xmath9 when @xmath9 is written in radix @xmath2 .",
    "the following function @xmath29 gives the _ leading part _ of @xmath9 , when written in radix @xmath2 .",
    "for example , let @xmath30 , then @xmath31 . as another example",
    ", we have @xmath32 but @xmath33 since 204 is written in radix @xmath34 as @xmath35 and thus @xmath36 .",
    "the map studied in this article has the general form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both non - negative real - valued functions at discrete time @xmath24 , @xmath40 being the dynamical variable and @xmath41 being the ` objective signal ' ruling the instantaneous dynamics and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are integer - valued functions that also evolve with time .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 , called the radix , is a natural number @xmath44 .",
    "the map eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) has the following meaning : at time @xmath45 , the value of the dynamical variable @xmath46 is given by @xmath40 but replacing the @xmath42-th digit of @xmath40 by the @xmath43-th digit of @xmath41 when both numbers are written in radix @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the map replaces a single digit of the numerical value of @xmath40 at each time step by a single digit of @xmath41 .    to show how eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) can be derived starting from an arbitrary non - autonomous map @xmath47 we approximate @xmath40 at each instant of time @xmath24 by the leading part of @xmath40 ( i.e. we neglect the contribution to @xmath40 of any digit that is not the most significant one ) .",
    "therefore , we have , in terms of the leading part @xmath48 function defined in eq .",
    "( [ leadp ] ) , @xmath49 for any @xmath50 .",
    "the radix values @xmath51 can be conveniently chosen at each time so as to optimize the approximation @xcite .",
    "we demand here that they are equal to some powers @xmath52 , @xmath53 of a natural number @xmath44 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 being integers .",
    "we let @xmath2 constant and regard @xmath54 and @xmath55 as functions of time .",
    "we also demand the following inequalities ( which can always be satisfied by suitably chosing @xmath2 ) @xmath56 where the brackets @xmath57 denote the fractional part function . by subtracting eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath58 we now note that , @xmath59 as well as @xmath60 . thus , if we take @xmath54 and @xmath55 at each time so that @xmath61 we see that , if we identify @xmath62 by using eqs .",
    "( [ comeon2 ] ) and ( [ demand ] ) and by replacing all these quantities in eq .",
    "( [ comeon ] ) we finally obtain eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) .",
    "we note that there is considerable freedom above to choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath41 .",
    "this freedom is related to a scaling property of the replacement dynamics that we point out below , see eq .",
    "( [ rp0 ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that _ the dynamics of any arbitrary non - autonomous map , eq .",
    "( [ nonauto ] ) , can always be approximated by a digit replacement dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ absmap])_. the contrary , however , is not necessarily true , i.e. _ there are choices for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) such that the latter equation can not be approximated by eq .",
    "( [ nonauto])_.    since the digit replacement dynamics , eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) , is more general than the dynamics provided by a non - autonomous map of the form eq .",
    "( [ nonauto ] ) , the aim of the rest of this article is to study the digit replacement dynamics for the simplest input functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; the latter being constant , linear , or simply periodic functions of @xmath24 .",
    "_ we shall take @xmath63 constant throughout .",
    "_    we define the replacement operator , @xmath64 as @xmath65 this operator replaces the @xmath66-th digit of @xmath67 by the @xmath68-th digit of @xmath69 ( when both are written in radix @xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , the digit replacement dynamics of map eq .",
    "( [ absmap ] ) is concisely written in terms of this operator as @xmath70    we observe that , for any integers @xmath71 and @xmath66 , because of the scaling property of the digit function , eq .",
    "( [ scaldigit ] ) , the following important relationship holds @xmath72",
    "the richness of the dynamical behavior of eq .",
    "( [ thedyna ] ) is better explored and understood step by step starting from the most trivial instances of @xmath42 and @xmath43 and progressing to more complex behavior . if @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 constant , eq .",
    "( [ thedyna ] ) reduces to @xmath76 which trivially replaces the most significant digit of @xmath40 by the most significant one of @xmath75 and does nothing else .",
    "thus , already on the first time step , a fixed point @xmath77 is so reached , with value @xmath78 in the following , we shall , of course , consider more interesting and increasingly complex dynamics .",
    "we can now consider @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a digit replacement dynamics going from the most significant digits of @xmath40 and @xmath75 to the less ones @xmath79 so that eq . ( [ thedyna ] ) reduces to the simple form @xmath80 this simple map can exactly be solved for the orbit for any initial condition @xmath81 as @xmath82 the proof of this result is trivial by induction . at @xmath83",
    "we have @xmath84 let us assume eq .",
    "( [ orbit ] ) valid at time @xmath24 .",
    "then , at time @xmath45 @xmath85 @xmath86 where we have used the obvious fact that , in this case @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "this proves the validity of eq .",
    "( [ orbit ] ) .",
    "thus , the map converges to the fixed point @xmath89 we observe that there is indeed an infinite number of isolated fixed points separated in value by powers of @xmath2 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath90 is always present regardless of the value of @xmath2 , although its basin of attraction ( which corresponds to all those initial conditions for which @xmath91 ) is explicitly @xmath2-dependent . thus , if @xmath77 is the fixed point corresponding to @xmath81 , @xmath77 attracts all initial conditions in the semiopen interval @xmath92 but there is also a fixed point @xmath93 for any @xmath94 which attracts all initial conditions in the interval @xmath95 . _",
    "the existence of these fixed points is a consequence of the scale invariance implied by eq .",
    "( [ rp0 ] ) . _ from eq .",
    "( [ fpoints ] ) we also observe that _ the larger @xmath2 , the wider the basins of attractions of the fixed points_. we also note that for @xmath96 , @xmath97 independently of @xmath75 since @xmath98 .    in fig .",
    "[ fpm ] the evolution of @xmath40 is plotted for initial conditions @xmath99 $ ] as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ orbit ] ) for @xmath100 and for @xmath34 ( left ) and @xmath14 ( right ) .",
    "we observe the existence of fixed points for the values predicted by eq .",
    "( [ fpoints ] ) and the observation made above that the larger @xmath2 , the wider their basins of attraction . in the range of initial conditions considered , there are 13 fixed points for @xmath34 and four fixed points for @xmath14 . as we see , independently of the value of @xmath2 , @xmath100 is always a fixed point for the range of initial conditions @xmath91 ( the thickness of the basin of attraction of the fixed point being @xmath2-dependent ) as obtained from the theory above .",
    "we also observe that the smaller @xmath2 , the slower the convergence to the fixed points .",
    "this is clear from the fact that for lower @xmath2 and constant @xmath81 , more digits are needed to render @xmath81 up to a certain precision and the number of such significant digits is directly proportional to the duration of the transient .",
    "the evolution to @xmath75 , starting from an arbitrary @xmath81 generally converges in a non - monotonic , nonlinear manner .",
    "for @xmath101 the successive iterates of the map for @xmath100 and @xmath14 are @xmath102 where it is clear that the convergence to the fixed point @xmath103 is achieved by replacing at each time step @xmath24 a less significant digit of @xmath81 by the corresponding one of @xmath103 ( the digits that have been replaced are written in bold above ) . for @xmath34 , we have , however , the sequence of iterates given by @xmath104 as predicted by the above development .",
    "although it is not apparent that this latter evolution is a digit replacement dynamics , this is only so because we are giving the numbers in the decimal radix . had we chosen the binary radix for the representation of the above numbers , we would then see that , indeed , digits of @xmath40 ( that are all 0 or 1 ) are being gradually replaced by those of @xmath75 ( from the most to the less significant places ) .",
    "thus , although the choice of the radix is immaterial for the numbers themselves ( a number is ` always the same ' regardless of the radix used ) the radix @xmath2 , in which the dynamics governed by eq .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) takes place , constitutes the optimal _ representation _ @xcite to understand what is going on .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) and the above mathematical development finds a physical application in the problem of hierarchical deposition of debris on a surface , in which grains of different sizes are deposited in an order related to their size , from larger to smaller grains @xcite . here",
    ", the deposition takes place according to a certain rule in which grains of bigger size deposit first and a next generation of grains , which are smaller by a factor @xmath105 , deposit next .",
    "we first construct a model for @xmath75 , that characterizes the objective attractor .",
    "we have recently found @xcite , that if @xmath106 and @xmath107 denote spatial coordinates on the plane @xmath108 then , for @xmath109 $ ] an integer and @xmath110 , the function given by @xmath111 is a surface with fractal self - affine properties @xcite .",
    "thus , if we start from a ` clean ' surface @xmath112 it is now clear , from the discussion given above , that this surface will be an attractor of the dynamics given by the map @xmath113 which corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) with @xmath114 and with @xmath40 having now a spatial dependence @xmath115 on the real coordinates @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we also fix , in eq .",
    "( [ map1 ] ) , @xmath116 .",
    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ fpoints ] ) , we observe that if we start from a ` clean ' surface @xmath112 the map shall converge to @xmath117 for any point @xmath118 on the plane .",
    "this convergence proceeds as follows . on the clean surface , in the first iteration",
    "the first grains are deposited , with area @xmath119 and height @xmath120 .",
    "then , in the next time step smaller grains with area @xmath121 are deposited .",
    "the process goes on from the bigger to the smaller scales until convergence to the fractal object @xmath122 is achieved .",
    "more significant digits of @xmath122 have a longer spatial variability as we prove in the coarse graining theorem recently reported in @xcite .    in figure [ growf ]",
    "this process of fractal surface growth is shown , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mapbw ] ) for for @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 $ ] and @xmath126 $ ] .",
    "four time steps of the spatiotemporal evolution @xmath115 are shown ( the time step is indicated on each panel ) , giving two different views of the same surface .",
    "we observe a fractal surface deterministically growing from the coarser to the finer details .",
    "although we have considered a digit replacement dynamics from most to less significant digits , it is also possible to select at random the digit to be replaced and the attractor will be the same , after a sufficiently large number of time steps .",
    "in combination with our results in @xcite this provides an explanation of why iterated functions systems @xcite generally lead to fractal attractors .",
    "let us now consider @xmath42 and @xmath43 given by the following simple expressions @xmath127 in which case , eq .",
    "( [ thedyna ] ) , reduces to @xmath128 at each time step the most significant digit of @xmath40 is replaced by a digit of @xmath75 that is @xmath129 digits away ( to less significant places ) from the most significant digit of @xmath75 , given by @xmath130 .",
    "we note that , at every time , only one of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 are used to replace the most significant digit of @xmath40 .",
    "this is so because of the digit function being periodic , as made explicit by eq .",
    "( [ periodigit ] ) , and one has @xmath132 there are thus two possibilities : 1 ) any of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 is equal to zero when written in radix @xmath2 , in which case @xmath40 converges to zero ; 2 ) none of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 when written in radix @xmath2 is zero , in which case , because of eq .",
    "( [ nperiod ] ) the orbit of @xmath40 has period @xmath131 as well .",
    "the case 1 ) is easy to understand .",
    "for , if any of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 in radix @xmath2 is zero , after @xmath131 time steps the most significant digit of @xmath40 has been once replaced by zero and as a result @xmath133 becomes more negative .",
    "this means that the leading part of @xmath40 decreases in a factor of @xmath2 .",
    "if this process is repeated an infinite number of times @xmath134 which means that the leading partis proportional to @xmath135 , i.e. that @xmath40 has converged to zero .",
    "we now concentrate on the more interesting case 2 ) in which none of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 is zero . the orbit can again be trivially solved in this simple case , and has for any @xmath136 the form @xmath137 since all time dependence affects only the most significant digit of @xmath40 accompanying a power @xmath138 of the radix and all other digits are left invariant .",
    "this time dependence has period @xmath131 for all @xmath139 as can be seen by making the transformation @xmath140 and observing that , since @xmath141 , this implies , from eq .",

    ", however , since @xmath146 is written as @xmath151 in radix @xmath152 , we have that the shape of the oscillation consists of @xmath153 different monotonic parts @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 . in both cases",
    "we observe the existence of an infinite number of periodic attractors a distance @xmath159 apart , each consisting of a continuous band of periodic orbits which is @xmath160 thick .",
    "the existence of such periodic attractors is a consequence of the scale invariance of the replacement operator , made explicit by eq .",
    "( [ rp0 ] ) .",
    "we can now move a step further and consider a slightly more interesting dynamics that is easily understood from the above .",
    "let @xmath161 and @xmath162 be both finite natural numbers .",
    "we take @xmath163 again , we have two cases depending on whether any of the @xmath131 most significant digits of @xmath75 in radix @xmath2 is zero or not .",
    "the outcome of the former case is that @xmath40 converges to zero for a sufficiently long time , as before .",

    "the resulting dynamical evolution depends now on two periods @xmath131 and @xmath164 which lead , after a transient , to a periodic orbit , where the period @xmath165 is the least common multiple of @xmath164 and @xmath131 .",
    "note that eq .",

    "( [ condib ] ) by taking @xmath227 we find the irrational number    @xmath228    which does not contain any zero digit for @xmath14 .",
    "we now consider the temporal evolution of @xmath40 taking this latter number @xmath229 as parameter . in figure [ aperion ] ( right ) @xmath40 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ aperiodyna2 ] ) is plotted for the initial conditions in the set @xmath215 $ ] , @xmath216 , @xmath14 and @xmath230 .",
    "stable aperiodic oscillations are shown to attract connected sets of initial conditions .",
    "the attractors are all qualitatively distinct , by virtue of the scaling symmetry breaking , and each displays a distinct aperiodic behavior .",
    "the trajectory exhibits more abrupt and sudden changes for @xmath216 close to unity ( i.e. for @xmath173 ) and is coarser for @xmath81 larger .",
    "we observe that there is no exponential sensitivity to initial conditions even when the resulting dynamics is forever aperiodic : all close initial conditions within an interval @xmath226 are attracted to a thin band of aperiodic trajectories of thickness @xmath231 where they keep a constant distance .",
    "we can , indeed , rigorously prove that the distance of trajectories starting infinitesimally close remains constant : the lyapunov exponent of the map is zero for every possible value of @xmath164 in eq .",
    "( [ motls ] ) as we proceed to show .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath232 be two different trajectories starting from initial conditions @xmath81 and @xmath233 that are infinitesimally close . in practice , this means that we can take @xmath234 with @xmath235 sufficiently small .",
    "here we have used eq .",
    "( [ iden ] ) to expand @xmath236 in radix @xmath2 thus making clear that the digits of the initial conditions @xmath81 and @xmath233 are equal up to @xmath235 significant digits after the radix point . since @xmath164 is equal for both trajectories that are infinitesimally separated because @xmath237 and since @xmath164 is finite , positive , and non - vanishing , it is enough to take @xmath238 .",
    "the dynamics only affects the @xmath164 most significant digits of @xmath232 and @xmath40 _ and leaves all other unaffected_. furthermore , and crucially , each single digit of @xmath40 and @xmath232 that is being replaced at each time @xmath24 is _ at the same position _ relative to the radix point for both numbers , and it is replaced _ by the same digit _ of @xmath75 ( i.e. the @xmath43-th digit of @xmath75 , as given by eq .",
    "( [ nsna2 ] ) at each @xmath24 ) .",
    "consequently , the difference of the contributions coming from these @xmath164 digits to @xmath239 cancel out and we are only left with @xmath240 at every time .",
    "therefore , the lyapunov exponent @xmath241 which means that the attractor , _ in spite of being aperiodic , is not chaotic_. the above proof is equally valid for the dynamics described in sections b and c. for the dynamics in section a we , trivially , find @xmath242 , since @xmath243 as @xmath244 as a consequence of the existence of a stable fixed point given by eq .",
    "( [ fpoints ] ) which is the same for both trajectories .",
    "we must emphasize the importance of @xmath75 being _ irrational _ for the dynamics above being aperiodic . because if @xmath75 were rational , then it would have an infinitely repeating period of , say , @xmath245 digits after the radix point , and the dynamics would trivially reduce to the ones described in sections b and c ( with @xmath246 finite ) .",
    "let us summarize the results of the above analysis , all trivial consequences of our construction :    * the dynamics is aperiodic on the attractor . *",
    "the lyapunov exponent is zero . *",
    "this behavior is possible only if @xmath75 is an irrational number .",
    "if @xmath75 is rational , the dynamics is periodic .",
    "although we are not establishing here the fractal character of the aperiodic attractors , we must remark the analogy of the behavior that we have described with the one found in so - called _ strange nonchaotic attractors _",
    "( snas)@xcite , which are driven by a forcing consisting of an incommesurate ratio of frequencies ( this ratio being an irrational number that plays an analogous role to @xmath75 here ) .",
    "a sna is a fractal structure attracting the trajectories in phase space so that the dynamics of the system is not exponentially sensitive to initial conditions ( its lyapunov exponent being non - positive ) .",
    "the existence of snas was first pointed out in a seminal paper by grebogi , ott , pelikan and yorke @xcite and have been widely studied since @xcite .",
    "experimentally , snas were first discovered in the buckling of a magnetoelastic ribbon driven quasiperiodically by two incommensurate frequencies with the golden ratio relationship @xcite . since then they have also been reported in other laboratory experiments involving electrochemical cells @xcite , electronic circuits @xcite , and a neon glow discharge @xcite .",
    "recently , based on the unprecedented light curves of the kepler space telescope , snas have also been observed for the first time out of the laboratory in the dynamics of the rrc lyrae star kic 5520878 , a blue - white star 16 000 light years from earth in the constellation lyra @xcite .",
    "the temporal dynamics exhibited by the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ aperion ] ( right ) on any of the attractors ( differently colored ) seems very similar to the time series found in snas , as for example the ones obtained ( in continuous time ) with a modified driven pendulum equation that has been used to model a driven squid with inertia and damping@xcite , see also fig 1c in@xcite .",
    "we must however remark that the dynamics is here time - discrete and that the lyapunov exponent is zero .",
    "if we set @xmath164 constant , independent of @xmath40 ( i.e. @xmath81 ) in eq .",
    "( [ motls ] ) , we recover back the scaling invariance and the above model reduces to eqs .",
    "( [ msna ] ) , ( [ nsna ] ) and ( [ aperiodyna ] ) and all aperiodic attractors in phase space become synchronized in phase ( which in this context means that , although the signals @xmath40 have different value , all their local maxima and minima are locked and synchronous in time ) .",
    "thus , in this situation , if one thinks on each separate aperiodic attractor as reflecting the evolution of an independent subsystem within a composite system , the aperiodic attractors are synchronized very much like in reference @xcite , where synchronization of snas is discussed .",
    "although we must conclude here our discussion of eq .",
    "( [ thedyna ] ) it should now be clear that if @xmath75 is no longer a parameter but a function of @xmath40 as well , we can have chaotic attractors as a result . already if we simply replace @xmath194 by @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ condib ] ) and @xmath75 by @xmath247 in eq .",
    "( [ aperiodyna ] ) or ( [ aperiodyna2 ] ) , the result is an aperiodic dynamics that is exponentially sensitive to initial conditions : the closer two different initial conditions @xmath81 and @xmath233 are , the longer the trajectories evolve together .",
    "however , as soon as the corresponding digits of @xmath40 and @xmath232 that are being used to replace the @xmath164 most significant digits of @xmath40 and @xmath232 begin to differ , the trajectories begin to depart aperiodically from each other and one can show that the lyapunov exponent is positive in this case . in the long term",
    ", the value of @xmath232 can not be estimated from the value of @xmath40 even when both @xmath40 and @xmath232 were initially close .",
    "in this work we have applied methods of digital mathematics @xcite to construct a generic nonlinear map which operates by replacing digits of the numerical value of a dynamical variable @xmath40 by those of a control parameter ( or signal ) @xmath75 . by considering increasingly complex dynamics ,",
    "we have shown how our map can be used to mathematically design aperiodic non - chaotic attractors .",
    "we have explicitly shown how this map can be understood as a discretization of any arbitrary non - autonomous map by working out in detail a mathematical method to achieve this connection in general .",
    "then , we have investigated the most simple cases of digit replacement dynamics .",
    "although the notation and the functions introduced here may seem unfamiliar , we believe that the nonlinear behavior obtained from the map is simpler to understand than the complex behavior arising from polynomial normal forms and maps involving transcendental functions . we have explicitly shown how limit cycle oscillations and aperiodic behavior can be mathematically designed , showing the advantages of this formulation .",
    "the theoretical results presented in the manuscript may be reproducible in experiments with nonlinear electric circuits .",
    "the digit function can be obtained in practice from a certain superposition of square waves or from a sawtooth signal appropriately quantized .",
    "thus , a circuit element performing the replacement operator may be constructed and the electric current through it may be shown to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript .    although all physical numbers are radix independent , they are all always _ represented _ in a specific radix ( e.g. the usual decimal radix ) .",
    "we have here thus constructed a new class of dynamical systems by regarding the possibility that the digits of the numbers are being replaced at each instant of time ( what every function indeed does ) one by one .",
    "note that in this article it is _ irrelevant _ which radix we actually choose for giving the numbers .",
    "however , if we choose the optimal _ representation _ for the radix @xmath2 at which the digits are being replaced , it becomes at once clear how dynamical processes , obtained through digit replacement , evolve in time ."
