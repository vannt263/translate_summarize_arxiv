    "thus , from the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : sff2 ] we obtain that the supersolid phase would survive up to temperatures of the order of @xmath144 nk or larger .",
    "magnetic quantum gases of @xmath146 have been recently trapped in lattices with a small spacing @xmath147 nm  @xcite . for @xmath148 molecules with magnetic dipole moment of @xmath149 ( with @xmath150 the bohr magneton )",
    "this implies @xmath151khz , which is comparable to the case of polar molecules .",
    "extrapolation from our numerical results ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediagram ] ) implies that a lattice depth of order of @xmath152 is necessary to induce supersolidity .    here , the recoil energy is @xmath153khz , and thus the condition on the lattice depth @xmath14 for inducing a supersolid behaviour reads @xmath154 , which is well in the continuum limit .",
    "the quantum kinetic energy reads @xmath155hz , for a low density @xmath156 .",
    "this corresponds to a critical temperature for observing supersolidity of the order of @xmath157nk , which is within experimental reach .",
    "we note that for the case of strongly dipolar magnetic gases , reaching densities of order unity in the lattice is possible .",
    "this in principle would allow for the observation of some of the effects described above , such as the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition for commensurate lattice fillings , at considerably higher temperatures .",
    "the results presented here may help to settle the long - standing question of the role of defect interactions for the formation of the supersolid phase @xcite and enable the experimental realization of a supersolid with quantum dipolar gases in combination with tunable optical lattices .",
    "we note that while here we have focused on specific examples with fixed defect densities , defect - induced supersolidity is expected to appear for a large range of densities for a careful choice of interaction parameters , e.g. , similar to the case of ref .",
    "this should make the observation of defect - induced supersolidity possible in experiments where particle density is tunable within a few percent only .",
    "the tunability of defect interactions opens also interesting prospects for the observation of other phases , such as solitons and breathers in the classical and quantum regimes  @xcite . + _",
