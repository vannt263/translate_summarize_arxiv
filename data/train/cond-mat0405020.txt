    "spin dynamics in multilayers consisting of a thin ferromagnetic film ( f ) imbedded between normal metal films ( n ) has received much attention recently .",
    "ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) experiments on n / f / n structures show that imbedding produces an additional spin damping@xmath0 .",
    "a possible explanation of these observations is that the localized spins in the ferromagnet interact , via s - d exchange , with the conduction electrons in the normal metal@xmath1 . due to this interaction ,",
    "a transfer of angular momentum takes place from the precessing ferromagnet to the conduction electrons in the adjacent n layers . the reactive torque generated by this transfer acts back on the ferromagnetic magnetization causing an increased linewidth and a shift of the ferromagnetic resonance absorption curve .",
    "an interesting formulation of this mechanism has been given in recent work by tserkovnyak et al@xmath2 .",
    "extending the scattering approach of parametric charge pumping by brouwer@xmath3 to spin pumping , these authors calculate the spin current pumped through the n / f and f / n contacts of the n / f / n structure .",
    "the modifications of the spin dynamics , due to the induced spin current , are expressed using the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation@xmath4",
    "@xmath5    where @xmath6 is the effective magnetic field , @xmath7 is the unit vector in the direction of the ferromagnetic magnetization , @xmath8 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath9 is the gilbert damping constant .",
    "according to ref .",

    "@xmath14 is the lande factor , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath16 is the total moment of the ferromagnetic film .",
    "the superscripts ( l ) and ( r ) correspond to the left ( n / f ) and right ( f / n ) interfaces of the n / f / n structure .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 stem from the spin currents pumped into the ( l , r ) normal layers ( leads ) .",
    "these parameters are expressed in terms of the scattering amplitudes as follows@xmath2    @xmath19    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the reflection and transmission amplitudes for electrons with up and down spins .",
    "the expressions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are to be evaluated with transverse modes @xmath23 taken at the fermi energy .    from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) we see , in conjunction with eq .",

    "as pointed out in ref .",
    "4 , this applies for ferromagnetic films that are thick compared to the coherence length @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the spin - up and spin - down fermi wave vectors , respectively . in this case",
    ", the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the mixing conductances of the f / n and n / f contacts@xmath37",
    ".    this approximation suppresses the effect of multiple reflections in ferromagnetic layers that are not much thicker than @xmath38 .",
    "the physics is very similar to that of the fabry - perot interferometer in optics .",
    "one manifestation of such interferences is oscillation of interlayer exchange coupling in f / n / f multilayers as a function of ferromagnetic - layer thickness .",
    "this effect has been first predicted from numerical calculations by barnas@xmath39 .",
    "subsequently , bruno@xmath40 offered an explanation based on quantum interference picture .",
    "results of his work have been confirmed by bloemen et al.@xmath41 who succeeded to see oscillations of the interlayer exchange coupling in co / cu / co as the thickness of the co layers is varied .",
    "the subject of the present work is to apply the spin - pumping approach to a model which allows multiple reflections in the ferromagnetic layer to be manifested in the renormalization of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "primary motivation for this investigation comes from the recent work by mills@xmath42 .",
    "the starting point of mills work is an approach@xmath43 which generalizes the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) theory to time - dependent source represented by the precessing vector @xmath44 . in this approach ,",
    "the renormalization of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 is found proportional to the frequency derivative of the real and imaginary parts of the transverse susceptibility , respectively .",
    "mills calculates the transverse susceptibility from a model which allows for multiple reflections in the ferromagnetic layer . instead of representing the ferromagnetic layer by two independently scattering outside interfaces , ( as done in refs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 13 ] ) , the electrons in ref .",
    "[ 12 ] are assumed to move in a spin - dependent potential of the trilayer in the form of a quantum well .",
    "this analysis yields an excess damping parameter @xmath45 which exhibits strong quantum oscillations with the thickness of the ferromagnetic film",
    "[ 13 ] and recent work of the present author@xmath46 show that , for a ferromagnetic monolayer , the dynamic rkky approach and the spin pumping theory yield the same results for the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we anticipate that application of the spin - pumping method to scattering by a quantum well potential will produce renormalizations of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath8 which also exhibit oscillations with the thickness of the ferromagnetic film .    in the present investigation",
    "we confirm this anticipation .",
    "however , it turns out that our results are , in several aspects , different from those of ref .",
    "primarily , we find that besides oscillations of @xmath47 there are also oscillations of the @xmath48-shift with similar period and magnitude .",
    "moreover , the periods of the oscillations show a dependence on the exchange splitting that is different from that of ref .",
    "we consider a trilayer , n / f / n , consisting of a ferromagnetic layer of thickness @xmath49 imbedded between normal metal layers , each of infinite thickness .",
    "the conduction electrons move in a spin - dependent potential @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coordinate perpendicular to the layers , and @xmath9 specifies the orientation of the spin relative to the direction of the magnetization of the ferromagnet .",
    "we assume that the electrons in the f layer are described by a single - band hubbard model@xmath52 . in the hartree - fock approximation",
    ", this model yields one - electron energies @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the on - site screened coulomb interaction . to simplify the calculations",
    ", we shift the energies in the f - region by @xmath55 .",
    "this brings the zero of energy to the bottom of the minority band . in this case",
    ", the spin - up conduction electron sees an attractive square well potential of depth @xmath56 , a quantity defining the exchange splitting between the majority and minority spin bands .",
    "the down- spin electron moves in a potential that is constant and equal to zero for all @xmath51 .",
    "thus , @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 for @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if the zero of energy is taken at the bottom of the majority band , the up - spin electron sees a potential barrier of height @xmath63 , while the down - spin electron moves in constant zero - value potential .",
    "this choice of potential has been previously used by bruno@xmath64 .",
    "mills@xmath42 assumes that the potential energy of the up - spin electron is @xmath65 above the zero of energy ( set at the bottom of the conduction band ) whereas the down - spin has potential energy @xmath66 .",
    "thus , bruno s potential follows by setting @xmath67 and our choice corresponds to taking @xmath68 .",
    "the fact that the results@xmath42 for the @xmath49-dependence of @xmath47 are not very sensitive to the choice of @xmath65 provides some justification for the present choice of the potential .",
    "our main motivation for this choice is that the @xmath51-component of the electron wave vector for spin up stays real ( see eq.(9 ) ) .",
    "this simplifies the summation over the transverse modes in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the single - band hubbard model implies that , owing to the high density of states , the effective mass of the itinerant electrons in the ferromagnetic layer is larger than the free electron mass .",
    "this complicates the scattering problem since , besides the potential well , there is also a `` mass barrier '' in the f - region .",
    "similar to refs .",
    "10 and 16 , we replace this position dependent mass by a constant average mass .",
    "it should be pointed out that an enhancement of the effective mass can also take place in normal layers due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "this effect is especially pronounced for pd and pt layers@xmath43 .",
    "we first consider the reflection amplitudes @xmath69 .",
    "since the transverse momentum is conserved , we have @xmath70 where @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the component of the wave vector along axis @xmath51 . for our choice of the potential",

    "since the expressions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are to be evaluated at the fermi energy , we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the magnitude of the in - plane wave vector @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "( 9 ) implies that @xmath78 stays real over the whole range , @xmath84 , of the variable @xmath81 .",

    "12 .    to determine the periods of the oscillations of @xmath231 , we consider the asymptotic estimate of the integral ( 35 ) for @xmath49 large .",
    "we note that the major contribution to this integral arises from the immediate vicinity of the end points of the integration interval @xmath232 and from the vicinity of the stationary points of the function @xmath233 . from eq .",
    "( 37 ) we see that the derivative of this function vanishes at the stationary point @xmath234 . however , the contribution of this stationary point to the integral ( 35 ) vanishes owing to the factor @xmath235 which causes the coefficients of all cosine terms to vanish .    for the same reason , the partial integration method yields a nonzero contribution only from the end point @xmath236 .",
    "this conclusion holds also for the simplified potential used in sec .",
    "in fact , setting @xmath237 , eq.(35 ) reduces to the integral ( 16 ) which is dominated by vicinity of @xmath238 .",
    "consequently , eq . ( 35 ) yields three short - wave oscillatory terms with periods @xmath239 and a long - wave term with period @xmath240 .",
    "hence , once electrons of both spin orientations are allowed to scatter , the spin - pumping approach exhibits oscillations similar to those of ref . 12 .",
    "the main distinction is that the wave vectors @xmath241 determining the periods of the oscillations in the dynamic rkky theory@xmath42 are replaced by the wave vectors @xmath242 .",
    "we now return to the aforementioned problem concerning the product @xmath217 in eq .",
    "first , we examine the integral ( 35 ) for the case when @xmath243 ( implying @xmath244 ) . in this case",
    ", it is possible to verify explicitly that @xmath245 as @xmath246 .",
    "specifically , the rapid oscillations tend to cancel the contribution of the three short - wave cosine terms in the integrand .",
    "the remaining terms , upon substituting @xmath244 , exactly cancel so that the integral ( 35 ) vanishes .",
    "this is in accord with the more general formula ( 4 ) .",
    "moreover , it provides an independent check that the rather complicated integrand of eq .",
    "( 35 ) is correct .",
    "based on this result and the fact that , upon letting @xmath237 , this equation goes over to eq .",
    "( 16 ) , we propose the following generalization of eq .",
    "( 20 )    @xmath247    where @xmath248 tends to a constant for @xmath49 large and contains a superposition of slowly decaying oscillations with periods @xmath249 and @xmath240 .",
    "( 38 ) also suggests that replacing the product @xmath217 by @xmath250 ^ 2 $ ] may endow eq .",
    "( 34 ) with a correct dependence on the splitting of the up and down - spin electron bands .    in the preceding section we came to the conclusion that quantum oscillations of the damping constant @xmath47 are accompanied by oscillations of similar magnitude and period of the relative shift , @xmath190 , of the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath48 .",
    "this spin - pumping result disagrees with that of the dynamic rkky method@xmath42 . in this method ,",
    "the renormalization of @xmath48 stems from the frequency derivative , called @xmath251 , of the transverse dynamical susceptibility .",
    "though ref .",
    "12 points out the general importance of this quantity in the spin dynamics , it reports rough estimates indicating that the renormalization effects due to @xmath252 are small .",
    "in the itinerant model of a bulk ferromagnet , the @xmath48-shift and the damping @xmath47 have been attributed to the combined effect of spin - orbit interaction and the electron - lattice interaction@xmath253 .",
    "mizukami et al.@xmath191 assume that @xmath204 and @xmath47 observed on pd / py / pd and pt / py / pt trilayers are due to similar interactions taking place at the interfaces .",
    "the results outlined in eqs .",
    "( 30)-(32 ) represent a strong departure from these ideas . in the framework of the spin - pumping theory ,",
    "the enhancement of the gyromagnetic ratio comes from the angular momentum of the conduction electron spin carried away from the f - film into the n - layers .",
    "it is the spin current that is in the phase with the precession that contributes to the @xmath48-factor .",
    "the out of the phase part gives rise to the excess damping @xmath47 .",
    "now in order that this mechanism works , it is necessary that the conduction electron spins are at equilibrium with the normal metal reservoirs .",
    "otherwise , spin accumulation takes place which blocks the flow of the spin current@xmath2 .",
    "the equilibrium is established by spin - lattice relaxation in the normal metal@xmath254 .",
    "this relaxation process involves the spin - orbit interaction combined with the electron - lattice interaction similar to the mechanism of ref .",
    "24 . in the spin - pumping approach",
    ", the conduction electron spin is first transported into the normal metal where it relaxes .",
    "thus we may view the relaxation of the ferromagnetic magnetization , in this approach , as a nonlocal process mediated via spin current . on the other hand , the itinerant electrons of the bulk ferromagnet",
    "relax via local spin - orbit interaction@xmath253 .",
    "clearly , the spin - orbit interaction is an inevitable component for magnetization relaxation in both mechanisms@xmath255 .",
    "it remains to address the reasons for the absence of quantum oscillations in the fmr experiments@xmath0 which study the gilbert damping and the @xmath48-factor as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic film .",
    "it is , of course , possible that another mechanism [ see ref . 1 ]",
    "intervenes and obliterates the predictions of eqs .",
    "26 and 27 .",
    "another possibility is that the oscillations are washed out by interface roughness .",
    "note that the wavelength of the short - wave oscillations , considered here , is about 5@xmath168 for cu / co / cu and only about 2@xmath168 for cu / fe / cu .",
    "it is conceivable that roughness introduces fluctuations of @xmath49 larger than these wavelength .",
    "averaging over these fluctuations strongly suppresses the amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "consequently , one essentially sees an average which is a constant of order 0.1 for fig.1 , and zero for fig .",
    "this is in apparent disagreement with the monolayer model invoked in sec .",
    "v to explain the large shift of the @xmath48-factor observed on pd / py / pd systems@xmath191 . to clarify this point",
    ", we note that the monolayer model assumes that the quantum oscillations in the ferromagnetic film rapidly decay with the distance from the interface . in the extreme case of overdamping ,",
    "the function @xmath137 does not change sign upon increasing @xmath49 by one wavelength form the origin .",
    "thus fluctuations of the thickness do not average the @xmath48-shift to zero in the monolayer model .",
    "though short - wave oscillations are expected to be washed out by surface roughness , there are also long - wave terms in the expressions for the gilbert damping and the shift of the gyromagnetic ratio that may survive the averaging over @xmath49 . as seen from eq .",
    "( 35 ) , these terms appear in @xmath36 when electrons of both spin orientations are subject to scattering .",
    "it can be shown in a similar way that these terms are also present in the expression for @xmath35 .",
    "since the period of these oscillations is @xmath240 , multilayers with small exchange splitting should be used to increase the chance of observing the long - wave oscillations .",
    "an alternative way of observing the quantum oscillations is suggested by the fact that @xmath130 and @xmath131 are functions of the product @xmath256 .",
    "thus , instead of changing the thickness of the ferromagnetic film , we may vary the parameter @xmath257 while keeping @xmath49 fixed . for the case",
    "when both @xmath258 and @xmath259 are nonzero , we have @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the depth of the potential well for electron of spin @xmath9 .",
    "these potential wells can be varied by shifting the chemical potentials , @xmath262 , of the electrons in the n - region .",
    "one possibility is to apply a potential difference across the n / f interface .",
    "this would change the parameters @xmath263 and @xmath264 by the same amount .",
    "consequently , only short - wave oscillations could be tuned in this manner .",
    "it is worth noting that , for the n / f interfaces considered here , a voltage drop of order 1ev is needed to sweep through several periods of the short - wave oscillations . to minimize joule heating associated with such a voltage drop",
    ", the interface resistance should be large .",
    "this could be achieved by a thin layer of oxide incorporated into the interface .",
    "tuning of long - wave oscillations requires that the difference @xmath265 is varied .",
    "it is tempting to consider the shift @xmath266 due to the spin polarized current normal to the interface@xmath267 . using eq .",
    "12 of ref .",
    "26 , we estimate that the current density required to generate a shift of 1ev is of order @xmath268 which rules out this idea .",
    "it is of interest , both experimentally and theoretically , to examine other processes contributing to the decay of multiple reflections in ideal multilayers .",
    "recent work of stiles and zangwill@xmath269 is of relevance in this context .",
    "these authors show that the transverse [ i.e. perpendicular to @xmath7 ] component of the spin current that flows from the normal metal into the ferromagnet is absorbed within a distance of several lattice constants . in the spin - pumping approach@xmath2 , it is also the transverse spin current that determines the gilbert damping and the gyromagnetic ratio . the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 give the magnitude of these currents .",
    "now , the present calculation of these parameters shows slowly - decaying oscillations in disagreement with ref .",
    "also the numerical results of mills@xmath42 do not show fast decaying oscillations of gilbert damping .",
    "we note that stiles and zangwill@xmath269 have identified three distinct processes contributing to the absorption of the transverse spin current : ( 1 ) spin dependent reflection and transmission ; ( 2 ) rotation of reflected and transmitted spins ; and ( 3 ) spatial precession of spins in the ferromagnet . out of these processes , it is the first one that the present theory and that of ref .",
    "12 takes into account .",
    "it should be interesting to incorporate the other two processes into these theories to see if a fast decay of the quantum oscillations ensues .",
    "it should be emphasized that these decay processes do not affect the longitudinal component of the spin current@xmath269 .",
    "incidentally , it is also this component which determines the exchange coupling between ferromagnetic films separated by normal metal spacer .",
    "thus , we expect that the @xmath49-dependence of the the coupling exhibits slowly decaying oscillations .",
    "this agrees with the theory of bruno@xmath40 and its experimental verification@xmath41 .    in view of the predicted fast decay of the transverse spin current",
    ", the @xmath49-dependent oscillations may be decaying faster than calculated in the present simplified model , and therefore less easy to detect than the oscillations of exchange coupling . in this context",
    ", it is worth noting that the decay of the transverse spin current depends on the fermi surface mismatch between the ferromagnetic and normal metal fermi surfaces@xmath269 .",
    "a slower decay is predicted when the mismatch is small @xmath271 . from this point of view , multilayers with small exchange splitting are preferable in order to mitigate the effect of the decay processes@xmath269 on quantum oscillations of the gilbert damping and gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "this work was motivated by illuminating discussions with professor b. heinrich to whom i want to express gratitude .",
