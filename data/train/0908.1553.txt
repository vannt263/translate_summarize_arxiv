    "tres-4 is the most bloated , with a density 15 per cent that of jupiter , and a radius larger by a factor 1.78 ( sozzetti et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the mass , composition and evolution history of a planet determines its current radius ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "2007 ; fortney et al . 2007 ) .",
    "recently , numerous theoretical studies have attempted to discover the reasons why some short - orbit , giant planets are bloated .",
    "a small fraction of stellar insolation energy would be sufficient to account for bloating , but no known mechanism is able to transport the insolation energy deep enough within a planet to significantly affect the planet s evolution ( guillot & showman 2002 ; burrows et al . 2007 ) .",
    "enhanced atmospheric opacity would cause internal heat to be lost more slowly , causing a planet s radius to be larger than otherwise at a given age ( burrows et al .",
    "indeed , the more highly irradiated planets are thought to have enhanced opacity due to species such as gas - phase tio / vo , tholins or polyacetylenes ( burrows et al .",
    "2008 ; fortney et al .",
    "these upper - atmosphere absorbers result in detectable stratospheres ( e.g. , knutson et al .",
    "2009 ) and prevent incident flux from reaching deep into the atmosphere , causing a large day - night temperature contrast , which leads to faster cooling ( guillot & showman 2002 ) . that some planets are not bloated",
    ", though they are in similar irradiation environments and have otherwise similar properties to bloated planets , may be due to differences in evolution history or in core mass ( guillot et al .",
    "2006 ; burrows et al . 2007 ) .",
    "currently , the most promising explanation for the large radii of some planets is that they were inflated when the tidal circularisation of eccentric orbits caused energy to be dissipated as heat within the planets ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "2001 ; gu et al . 2003 ; jackson et al .",
    "2008a ; ibgui & burrows 2009 ) .",
    "indeed , jackson et al .",
    "( 2008b ) found that the distribution of the eccentricities of short - orbit ( @xmath2 au ) planets could have evolved , via tidal circularisation , from a distribution identical to that of the farther - out planets .",
    "the angular momenta of a star and its planets derive from that of their parent molecular cloud , so close alignment is expected between the stellar spin and planetary orbit axes .",
    "when a planet obscures a portion of its parent star we observe an apparent spectroscopic redshift or blueshift ; which we see depends on whether the area obscured is approaching or receding relative to the star s bulk motion .",
    "this manifests as an ` anomalous ' radial velocity ( rv ) and is known as the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect ( e.g. , queloz et al . 2000a ; gaudi & winn 2007 ) .",
    "the shape of the rm effect is sensitive to the path a planet takes across its parent star , relative to the star s spin axis .",
    "thus , spectroscopic observation of a transit allows measurement of @xmath3 , the sky - projected angle between the stellar spin and planetary orbit axes .",
    "short - orbit , giant planets are thought to have formed just outside the ice boundary and migrated inwards ( e.g. , ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath3 is a useful diagnostic for theories of planet migration , some of which predict preservation of initial spin - orbit alignment and some of which would occassionally produce large misalignments .",
    "for example , migration via tidal interaction of a giant planet with a gas disc ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ; ward 1997 ) is expected to preserve spin - orbit alignment , whereas migration via a combination of planet - planet scattering and tidal circularisation of a resultant eccentric orbit is able to produce a significant misalignment ( e.g. , rasio & ford 1996 ; chatterjee et al . 2008 ; nagasawa et al .",

    "burrows et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that an enhanced atmospheric opacity can delay radius shrinkage , leading to a larger - than - otherwise planet radius at a given age .",

    "one might expect a low planetary atmospheric opacity due to the sub - solar metallicity of the wasp-17 star : [ fe / h ] = 0.25 .",

    "ibgui & burrows ( 2009 ) found that an atmospheric opacity of @xmath164 is sufficient to account for the radius of hd209458b .",
    "the very large radius of wasp-17b and its moderate age suggest that enhanced opacity alone , even of @xmath165 , is insufficient to account for the planet s bloatedness .",
    "it has been proposed ( bodenheimer et al . 2001 ; gu et al .",
    "2003 ; jackson et al .",
    "2008a ) that tidal dissipation associated with the circularisation of an eccentric orbit is able to substantially inflate the radius of a short - orbit , giant planet .",
    "if a planet is in a close ( @xmath2 au ) , highly eccentric ( @xmath166 ) orbit then planetary tidal dissipation will be significant and will shorten and circularise the orbit .",
    "orbital energy is deposited within the planet interior , leading to an inflated planet radius .",
    "this process is accelerated by higher atmospheric opacities : as the planet better retains heat , shrinking of the radius is retarded , and a larger radius causes greater tidal dissipation .",
    "higher eccentricities result in stronger tides , and thus in greater tidal dissipation",
    ". the rate at which energy is tidally dissipated within a body is inversely proportional to its tidal quality factor , @xmath167 , which is the ratio of the energy in the tide to the tidal energy dissipated within the body per orbit ( e.g. , ogilvie & lin 2007 ) .",
    "ibgui & burrows ( 2009 ) created a tidal dissipation model and applied it to hd209458b , which is bloated to a lesser degree than wasp-17b .",

    "ibgui & burrows ( 2009 ) hd209458b model suggests that tidal heating could produce even wasp-17b s maximum likely radius ( @xmath168 ) if , for example , it evolved from a highly eccentric ( @xmath169 ) , close ( @xmath170 au ) orbit , with moderate tidal dissipation ( @xmath171 ; @xmath172 ) and solar atmospheric opacity .",
    "the final semimajor axis of this particular model was shorter than that of wasp-17b , but within 10 per cent .",
    "such an eccentric , short orbit seems reasonable as planets in highly eccentric , quite short orbits are known : hd17156b ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 au ; winn et al .",

    "( 2008b ) found similar best - fitting values ( @xmath179 ; @xmath180 ) when matching the current eccentricities of short - orbit ( @xmath2 au ) planets with the eccentricities of farther out planets , from which they presumably evolved .",
    "the limited radial - velocity measurements during transit give a strong indication that wasp-17b is in a retrograde orbit .",
    "as the angular momenta of a star , its protoplanetary disc , and hence its planets , all derive from that of the parent molecular cloud , wasp-17b presumably originated in a prograde orbit .",
    "as a gas giant , wasp-17b is expected to have formed just outside the ice boundary ( @xmath93au ) and migrated inwards to its current separation of 0.05au ( e.g. , ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "migration of a giant planet via tidal interaction with a gas disc is expected to preserve spin - orbit alignment ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ; ward 1997 ) and is thus unable to produce a retrograde orbit .",
    "alternatively , migration via a combination of star - planet scattering ( takeda et al .",

    "; nagasawa et al .",
    "2008 ) and tidal circularisation of the resultant eccentric orbit is able to produce significant misalignment .",
    "in addition to inclined orbits , scattering is able to produce highly eccentric orbits ( e.g. , ford & rasio 2008 ) , which have been found to be common and are necessary if tidal circularisation is to inflate planetary radii ( e.g. , jackson et al . 2008b ) , whereas planet - disc interactions seem unable to pump eccentricities to large values ( @xmath181 ; dangelo et al . 2006 ) .",
    "nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) carried out orbital integrations of three - planet systems : three jupiter - mass planets were initially placed beyond the ice boundary ( 5au , 7.25au , 9.5au ) in circular orbits , with small inclinations ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 ) , around a solar - mass star .",
    "they found that a combination of planet - planet scattering , the kozai mechanism ( the oscillation of the eccenticity and inclination of a planet s orbit via the secular perturbation from outer bodies ; kozai 1962 ) and tidal circularisation produces short - orbit , giant planets in @xmath930% of cases .",
    "the kozai mechanism is most effective when the scattered , inner planet has an inclined orbit .",
    "a broad spread was seen in the inclination distribution of the short - orbit planets formed , including planets in retrograde orbits .",
    "therefore , we suggest that wasp-17b supports the hypothesis that some short - orbit , giant planets are produced by a combination of scattering , the kozai mechanism and tidal circularisation .",
    "the observation of the rm effect for more short - orbit planets is required to measure the size of the contribution .    for planet - planet or star - planet scattering to have influenced wasp-17b s orbit in the past ,",
    "one or more stellar or planetary companions must have been present in the system .",
    "sensitive imaging could probe for a stellar companion and further radial velocity measurements are necessary to search for stellar or planetary companions",
    ". it will be worthwhile looking for long - term trends in the rvs to detect farther - out planets that might have been involved in past scattering .",
    "a straight - line fit to the residuals of the rv data about the model fits indicates no significant drift over a span of 622days ( e.g. , for case 1 the drift is @xmath185 ) . in their three - planet integrations ,",
    "nagasawa et al . (",
    "2008 ) found that in 75% of cases one planet is ejected , a planet collides with the host star in 22% of cases , and two planets are ejected in 5% of cases .",
    "they also found that , since a small difference in orbital energy causes a large difference in semimajor axis in the outer region , the final semimajor axes of outer planets are widely distributed ( peak at @xmath915au , with a large spread ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that wasp-17 is now the only giant planet in the system or that the outer planets are in long orbits , which are difficult to detect with the rv technique .    the discovery of wasp-17b extends the mass - radius distribution of the 62 known transiting exoplanets ( figure  [ figmassradius ] ) .",
    "wasp-17b has the largest atmospheric scale height ( 11002100 km ) of any known planet by up to a factor 2 , due to its very low surface gravity and moderately high equilibrium temperature .",
    "the ratio of projected areas of planetary atmosphere to stellar disc of wasp-17b is 1.92.7 times that of hd209458b and 2.43.4 times that of hd189733b , for both of which successful attempts at measuring atmospheric signatures have been made ( e.g. , charbonneau et al .",
