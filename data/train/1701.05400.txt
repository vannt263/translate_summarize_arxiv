    "<S> its significance in standard physiological conditions is therefore subject to scrutiny @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a major difficulty in detecting the cerna effect unambiguously in experiments or data lies in the fact that it should be disentangled from other mechanisms that may bear a similar impact , i.e. an effective positive coupling , on transcripts . </S>",
    "<S> imagine a network of @xmath0 cerna species interacting with @xmath1 mirna species . </S>",
    "<S> cerna levels @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) fluctuate stochastically in time due to random synthesis and degradation events and to interactions with mirnas , whose levels are also subject to random fluctuations . denoting by @xmath4 the time - average in the steady state , an effective cerna - cerna dependence can be signaled by a statistical correlation coefficient such as pearson s @xcite , i.e. @xmath5^{1/2}},\\ ] ] with the idea that , if @xmath6 is large enough , a perturbation altering the level of cerna @xmath7 will cause part of the mirna population to move from one target to the other , effectively broadcasting the perturbation from cerna @xmath7 to cerna @xmath8 through mirna - mediated interactions .        </S>",
    "<S> a more direct description of this mechanism is attained instead via _ susceptibilities _ like @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the transcription rate of cerna @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 quantifies the shift in the mean level of cerna @xmath8 caused by a ( small ) variation in @xmath10 , and a large @xmath11 ( assuming no direct control of cerna @xmath8 by cerna @xmath7 ) points to mirna - mediated crosstalk between cernas @xmath8 and @xmath7 ( see fig . [ zero]c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> while both @xmath11 and @xmath6 capture aspects of cerna crosstalk seen in experiments , their underlying physical meaning is _ a priori _ different . fluctuating mirna levels naturally correlate co - regulated targets , so that a large @xmath6 is obtained when both cernas respond to the stochastic dynamics of their regulator </S>",
    "<S> this however does not necessarily imply a large @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath11 can be large even in absence of fluctuations in mirna levels , i.e. as a consequence of competition alone . </S>",
    "<S> in such conditions , @xmath6 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 has indeed been found to be asymmetric under exchange of its indices ( i.e. @xmath12 in general ) @xcite , at odds with @xmath6 which is necessarily symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> it would therefore be important to clarify how quantities like ( [ rho ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) are related in mirna - cerna networks , especially to understand whether responses to perturbations ( a central quantity of interest for many potential applications of the cerna effect ) can be encoded in quantities as intuitive and as simple to measure experimentally or from data as a pearson correlation coefficient .    </S>",
    "<S> here we show that the information conveyed by @xmath11 is indeed captured by a correlation function similar to @xmath6 . on the other hand , @xmath6 is linked to a susceptibility , i.e. to the response of a target to a perturbation altering the level of its competitor , but the perturbation concerns the intrinsic _ decay _ rate of the competitor rather than its transcription ( as is the case for @xmath11 ) . in the following , we will derive these results and validate them by computer simulations and gene expression data analysis , and explore their consequences .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    [ [ section-2 ] ]    we start from the dynamics of molecular populations in a mirna - cerna network , denoting by @xmath2 the level of cerna species @xmath8 ( ranging from 1 to @xmath0 ) , by @xmath13 the level of mirna species @xmath14 ( ranging from 1 to @xmath1 ) , and by @xmath15 the levels of mirna - cerna complexes . in the deterministic limit where stochastic fluctuations are neglected , the time evolution of concentration variables is described by @xmath16 with the different parameters denoting intrinsic synthesis ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and degradation rates ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , complex association / dissociation rates ( @xmath21 ) and complex processing rates ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 for stoichiometric and catalytic processing , respectively ) , while @xmath24 represents the mean lifetime of the complex formed by mirna @xmath14 and cerna @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that if the mean lifetime of complexes is much shorter than that of free molecular species , i.e. if @xmath25 and @xmath26 for each @xmath8 and @xmath14 , mirna - cerna complexes achieve a steady state much faster than mirna and cerna levels . in such conditions , @xmath27 and </S>",
    "<S> one can eliminate complexes from ( [ uno ] ) by replacing @xmath15 with its steady state value @xmath28 for @xmath29 ( i.e. when stoichiometric degradation without mirna recycling is the dominant channel of complex processing ) , this allows to re - cast ( [ uno ] ) in the form ( see supporting text ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function of all mirna levels @xmath32 and all cerna levels @xmath33 given by @xmath34 one easily sees ( see supporting text ) that @xmath31 decreases along trajectories of ( [ quattro2 ] ) , implying that its minimum describes the physically relevant steady state of ( [ uno ] ) with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    if intrinsic molecular noise ( arising from stochastic transcription and degradation events and from titration due to mirna - cerna interactions ) is added to ( [ uno ] ) , after a transient molecular levels will eventually stabilize and fluctuate over time around the steady state described by the minimum of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in finding a compact and intuitive mathematical form for the correlations arising between the different components in such conditions . </S>",
    "<S> molecular noise is poissonian , namely the strength of fluctuations affecting each variable is proportional to the square root of mean molecular levels ( see e.g. @xcite for an explicit representation in the context of a mirna - cerna network ) , which makes our goal especially challenging . </S>",
    "<S> however we will see that the effects of molecular noise can be remarkably well approximated by a uniform `` effective temperature '' @xmath37 representing the strength of fluctuations affecting all molecular species involved . in this case , one can describe fluctuations around the steady state as thermal fluctuations around a boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to compute averages of generic functions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 as `` thermal averages '' , i.e. @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a normalization factor , the deterministic limit being obtained for @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , defining @xmath43 by straightforward calculations one finds @xmath44    therefore , in this approximation , the susceptibility @xmath11 [ eq . ( [ chi ] ) ] is linked to the correlation function [ eq . ( [ chix ] ) ] @xmath45 which , as @xmath11 , is not symmetric under the exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath7 , while the cerna - cerna covariance @xmath46 is tied to the susceptibility @xmath47 quantifying the change in @xmath48 induced by a ( small ) change of the _ intrinsic degradation rate _ @xmath49 of cerna @xmath7 [ eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( note that @xmath50 . ) the constant linking these quantities is the temperature @xmath37 quantifying the strength of the uniform `` effective noise '' .    somewhat unexpectedly </S>",
    "<S> , the above results suggest that the susceptibility @xmath47 must be symmetric under exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath7 , i.e. , for instance , if the level of cerna @xmath8 is altered by changing the intrinsic degradation rate of cerna @xmath7 , then the reverse is also true . to check this property </S>",
    "<S> , one can calculate @xmath47 explicitly for a system formed by @xmath0 cerna species interacting with a single mirna species at steady state by following a different route , specifically along the lines of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considering the repression strength to which cernas @xmath8 and @xmath7 are subject at a given ( mean ) level @xmath51 of mirna species 1 ( @xmath52 in this case ) , one finds , for each cerna , a soft `` threshold '' value of @xmath51 , denoted by @xmath53 , such that @xmath8 is unrepressed ( resp . repressed or susceptible to changes in @xmath51 ) if @xmath54 ( resp . @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) . a direct calculation </S>",
    "<S> ( see supporting text ) shows that @xmath47 can attain large values only if both cernas are susceptible to @xmath51 , in which case one has ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 if cerna @xmath60 is repressed , unrepressed or susceptible , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ omegan1 ] ) confirms that @xmath47 is indeed symmetric under exchange of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the approximations under which the the above results were obtained , we remark that we started by considering ( [ uno ] ) in the limit of ( i ) fast complex equilibration , and ( ii ) mirna - cerna complex processing dominated by the stoichiometric channel , with the former playing the key role in deriving the function @xmath31 ( see supporting text ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note however that the overall scenario just described also holds for when complexes evolve over time scales much longer than those of free molecular levels , i.e. for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in particular , ( [ uno ] ) can again be re - cast in the form of ( [ quattro2 ] ) with @xmath31 given by ( [ elle ] ) , albeit with re - scaled transcription rates ( see supporting text for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conclude that , as long as molecular noise can be approximated by a uniform effective temperature ,    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the cerna - cerna covariance @xmath63 is a proxy for the susceptibility @xmath47 , and + 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function @xmath64 is a proxy for the susceptibility @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-3 ] ]    we have validated the above scenario by simulating a small network involving 2 cerna and a single mirna species via the gillespie algorithm @xcite , where molecular noise is accounted for explicitly ( see supporting text ) . </S>",

    "<S> we considered three scenarios for the mean lifetime of mirna - cerna complexes , namely those covered by the theory ( i.e. complex equilibration much faster and much slower than the equilibration of mirna and cerna levels ) as well as the intermediate case where characteristic timescales are comparable for all variables .        </S>",
    "<S> .parameters used in fig [ figuno ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath72 while @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> [ tab : table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one sees that theoretical predictions obtained in the `` thermal noise '' approximation agree remarkably well with simulations including the actual molecular noise . in particular , the full correspondence between the susceptibilities @xmath47 and @xmath11 and the ( re - scaled ) correlation functions @xmath74 and , respectively , @xmath75 is evident . </S>",
    "<S> notice that a single global parameter @xmath76 has been used to fit all data in each of the conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this shows how accurately the assumption of a uniform effective temperature can mimic the effects of intrinsic stochasticity . on the other hand , its limits </S>",
    "<S> might be reflected , at least in part , in the discrepancies that occur at high transcription rates .    </S>",
    "<S> these results confirm that ( [ chix ] ) and ( [ cc ] ) are indeed good predictors of the response of a cerna to a perturbation affecting one of its competitors within a mirna - cerna network . </S>",
    "<S> notably , such correlation functions are easy to estimate from transcription data sets . </S>",
    "<S> our framework therefore has the potential to offer new insight into post - transcriptional regulation , its system - level organization and its impact on cellular functions .    in order to test this idea </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed the cerna scenario emerging from 1098 breast cancer samples obtained from the cancer genome atlas @xcite , focusing on the widely studied oncosuppressor pten and its immediate competitors ( i.e. the cernas sharing at least one mirna regulator with pten ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we computed @xmath77 for a set of candidate pten cernas found in @xcite by means of mutually targeted mirna - response element enrichment analysis . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the average appearing in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cij][xpc ] ) is over samples and not over time . </S>",
    "<S> we expect however that , if the interaction network is conserved across samples , averages over samples should reproduce statistical averages such as ( [ xx ] ) , as different samples effectively represent different snapshots of the state of the network . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figtre]a shows that when ( [ cij ] ) ( whose value is encoded in the color of markers ) is large , both ( [ xcp ] ) and ( [ xpc ] ) tend to be large . according to ( [ omegan1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , a large @xmath74 ( or @xmath47 ) signals that both pten and its competitor are susceptible to changes in the level of at least one of their shared regulators .        for such pairs , in addition </S>",
    "<S> , it has previously been shown that both @xmath11 and @xmath78 are expected to be large @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a fully bi - directional crosstalk , i.e. any perturbation affecting the level of one species should affect the level of the other via mirna - mediated regulation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this was experimentally shown to be the case in @xcite for some of the cernas we tested ( e.g. serinc1 , vapa ) , all of which are in this regime according to our analysis . adding to this , we are also able to point to a number of other pten competitors , </S>",
    "<S> a perturbation of which should trigger a response by pten .    on the other hand , smaller values of ( [ cij ] ) ( orange markers in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figtre]a ) are associated to strongly asymmetric pten - cerna pairs for which ( [ xpc ] ) is much larger than ( [ xcp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that pten will respond to an increase of its competitor s bare transcription rate ( and not vice - versa ) , while no response of pten should be expected upon perturbing the bare decay rate of the same cerna as @xmath74 is small . within the steady state theory of @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> cerna pairs with strongly different values of @xmath11 and @xmath78 pertain to cases where the responding cerna ( pten here ) is susceptible to variations in the mirna levels while the perturbed one ( pten s competitor ) is fully repressed . </S>",
    "<S> our data analysis fully confirms both this scenario and the theory presented here in linking such cases to low values of the bare covariance ( [ cc ] ) .    finally , note ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figtre]b ) that the above information can not be retrieved if @xmath74 is replaced by the pearson coefficient @xmath6 , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho ] ) , which just amounts to normalizing @xmath74 by the product of the standard deviations @xmath79 and @xmath80 of @xmath2 and @xmath81 . indeed , using the value of @xmath6 to color - code pten s cernas </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that the pearson coefficient can mislead into expecting ( or not expecting ) a response to a perturbation when the actual susceptibilities are small ( resp . </S>",
    "<S> large ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath6 is rather small for the pair formed by pten and slc1a2 , which seems to suggest absence of mutual cross - talk between these two transcripts . </S>",
    "<S> however , while both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are small , @xmath84 is significant . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that ( i ) slc1a2 will not respond to a perturbation affecting the transcription rate of pten , and ( ii ) the pair will be insensitive to changes in each other s bare decay rate ; however , ( iii ) pten _ will be affected _ by a change in the bare transcription rate of its competitor despite the small statistical correlation that exists between their levels . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the large value of the pearson coefficient between pten and dtwd2 can mislead into generically expecting a response when instead the susceptibility is strongly perturbation - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the level of dtwd2 should not be significantly modified by a change in the level of pten ( as @xmath85 is rather small ) in spite of the large pearson coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> notice that , remarkably , for this pair , @xmath74 and @xmath6 take on very different values .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-4 ] ]    to sum up , we have identified [ eq.s ( [ comega ] ) and ( [ chix ] ) ] a set of correlation functions that can serve as proxies for cerna susceptibilities to perturbations . specifically , @xmath63 is related to the susceptibility @xmath47 quantifying cerna @xmath8 s response to a change of the bare decay rate of cerna @xmath7 , while @xmath86 is related to the susceptibility @xmath11 quantifying cerna @xmath8 s response to a change of the bare transcription rate of cerna @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these relations are valid at steady state and within the approximations discussed , are fully confirmed by numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , quantities like @xmath74 and @xmath75 can be easily estimated from data and possibly measured in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of pten s emergent crosstalk pattern from tcga breast cancer dataset using these functions has indeed shown that a map of cerna responses to perturbations affecting competitors can be constructed by combining the information provided by each , while the pearson coefficient @xmath6 can be inaccurate in this respect . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the way to probing the structure and function of cerna networks _ in silico _ by straightforwardly analyzing transcriptional data , and provides a key to obtain testable transcriptome - scale predictions about cerna crosstalk .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that our results apply without any modification to cerna pairs that do nt share mirna regulators , i.e. it is capable of identifying long - range crosstalk ( i.e. interactions between cernas that are separated by multiple mirnas along the mirna - cerna network ) of the kind discussed in @xcite .    from the viewpoint of physics , results like ( [ comega ] ) and ( [ chix ] ) are akin to the `` fluctuation - response relations '' that constitute a cornerstone of statistical mechanics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their derivation in our context has relied on an equilibrium framework that presupposes stationarity of molecular levels . </S>",
    "<S> since cerna crosstalk can be substantially more complex away from the steady state @xcite , a more refined mathematical study will be required to extend the theory developed here to off - equilibrium dynamical regimes . </S>",
    "<S> our results on the other hand may also open the way to the application of recently developed inference techniques @xcite to estimate mirna levels or kinetic parameters from cerna levels .    </S>",
