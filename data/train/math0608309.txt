    "the main stages of the construction and the notations are similar to those in @xcite , but the technical details rely on a generalized contractivity principle which we prove for abstract multiseries ( theorem  [ pfp ] ) . we then discuss how various classes of problems are solved within transseries . the last part of the paper is devoted to a brief overview of generalized borel summation , an isomorphism used to associate actual functions to transseries , in the context of odes , difference equations and the extension of some of these techniques to pdes .",
    "various spaces of transseries were introduced roughly at the same time in logic ( see @xcite ) , analysis @xcite , @xcite , and the theory of surreal numbers @xcite ; similar structures were introduced independently by berry and used as a powerful tool in applied mathematics , see @xcite .",

    "this universality of representation can be seen as a byproduct of the fact that transseries are closed under many common operations .",

    "when corresponding functions are considered we change variables so that the limit is again @xmath4 .",
    "a simple example of a transseries generated by @xmath2 and @xmath5 is    @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this transseries is without logarithms or log - free , and has _ level _",
    "one since it contains no iterated exponential ; the simplest nontrivial transseries of level two is @xmath8 .",
    "a more complicated example of a transseries of exponential level two , with level zero _ generators _ @xmath2 and @xmath9 , level one generator @xmath10 , and level two generators @xmath11 and @xmath12 is    @xmath13 some examples of transseries - like expressions for @xmath14 , which are in fact _ not _ transseries , are @xmath15 ( it fails the asymptoticity condition ) and @xmath16 ( it does not have finitely many generators , this property is described precisely in the sequel ) .",
