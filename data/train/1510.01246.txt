    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , at only 49.97 kpc @xcite is a gas rich environment with reduced metallicity ( z about half of the galactic value ) that allow us to obtain detailed observational data to study the physical processes leading to massive star formation in an interstellar medium ( ism ) that may be comparable , to certain degree , to those conditions of some star - forming sites in our galaxy in the early stages ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "several global surveys of the molecular component in the lmc have been done so far , mainly in the co j=10 emission , in increasing resolutions , starting with an angular resolution of @xmath810  @xcite , to the latest made with nanten with 26 of angular resolution @xcite .",
    "these surveys were complemented with observations at better angular resolution of known individual cloud complexes , such as the eso sest key programme ( e.g. @xcite ) , the magellanic mopra assessment ( e.g. @xcite ) , and the second survey of molecular clouds with nanten @xcite .",
    "most of the molecular line surveys and individual observations towards the lmc do not cover the 345 ghz window , which contains several molecular lines that provide substantial information about the physical and chemical conditions .",
    "with the idea of carry out a comparative study of the physical conditions of the molecular gas in hii  regions in the lmc using molecular lines in the 345 ghz windows , we have made observations with the atacama submillimetre telescope experiment ( aste ) towards different regions . in @xcite ( hereafter paperi ) , we published the results from n113 study . in this paper",
    "we add the results from the study of other three hii  regions : n159 , n132 , and n166 .",
    "although these regions share the same global characteristics in terms of metallicity , they are located in a completely different environment within the lmc ( see figure [ global ] ) .",
    "n159 is by far the most studied hii  region of the set .",
    "situated approximately 600 pc in projection south of 30 dor , in the co molecular ridge , it is a region likely perturbed by the interaction with the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "the n159 complex was classified , in the nanten catalog compiled by @xcite , as a type iii giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) , that is a gmc with hii  regions and young star clusters .",
    "this complex is populated by young massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) and presents numerous features characteristic of active star formation regions .",
    "@xcite discovered the first extragalactic protostar here , and @xcite the first type i extragalactic oh maser .",
    "it is known that n159 hosts massive embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) , a maser source , and several ultracompact hii  regions @xcite .",
    "the carbon in the gaseous phase of the whole complex was studied in detail by @xcite , whereas @xcite studied the warm dense molecular gas .",
    "recently @xcite , using alma j=21 observations , discovered the first extragalactic protostellar molecular outflows towards this region .",
    "n166 located in projection about 550 pc south - east of 30 dor , between 30 dor and n159 to the east of the co molecular ridge .",
    "this region , associated with the molecular cloud dem 310 @xcite and the giant molecular complex-37 @xcite , was cataloged as type ii gmc ( a gmc with hii  regions only ) in the nanten catalog .",
    "@xcite studied the j=10 and j=32 emission towards five clumps in n166 , and suggest that this region is in a younger phase of star formation than n159 as density has not yet reached high enough to start the born of massive stars .",
    "n132 located in projection about 1200 pc south - west of 30 dor , on the northern edge of lmc bar , is associated with the molecular clouds dem 172 , 173 and 186 @xcite . as in the case of n166",
    "this region is also a gmc type ii .",
    "this region has not been particularly studied apart of a global characterization in which the h@xmath1 column density is estimated and the h@xmath1co ratio determined @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the study we have carried out with new observations made towards the lmc hii  regions n159 , n132 , and n166 in a set of molecular lines in the 345 ghz window : and j=32 and the unexplored lines ( in n159 ) hcn , hnc , , and c@xmath1h ( in the j=43 transition ) , cs j=76 , and c@xmath2o j=32 .",

    "once obtained the column density ( see equation3 in paperi ) , we assumed an abundance ratio of [ /h@xmath1 ] @xmath18 @xcite to derive the h@xmath1 column density . finally , the molecular mass was estimated from : @xmath19},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the solid angle subtended by the beam size , @xmath21 is the distance ( 50  kpc ) , @xmath22 is the hydrogen mass , and @xmath23 is the mean molecular weight , assumed to be 2.8 by taking into account a relative helium abundance of 25 % . the summation was performed over all the beam positions belonging to the molecular structure delimited by the 7 k  contour displayed in fig.[n159map ] .",

    "the code was run for a grid of kinetic temperatures between 20 and 100 k. the selected model was that in which the intersection of the curves is more tight ( this was the model with t@xmath82 80 k ) . to perform this analysis , we assumed that the lower co transitions arise mainly from the cold gas component , while the higher ones from the warmer one .",

    "do not converge , and in addition , the intersections of all curves are not so tight as in the 80 k case .",
    "table[tradex ] presents the results for all analysed molecules .",
    "our j=32 map of n159-w is very similar to the map recently presented by @xcite , which shows that the molecular peak is shifted southwest compared to the peak of the ir emission .",
    "it is important to note that we are presenting the first detections of , hcn , hnc , and c@xmath1h in the j=43 transition , cs in the j=76 , and tentatively the c@xmath2o j=32 line towards n159-w , precisely towards an ir peak , revealing that this region has the physical conditions needed to excite these lines ( for instance the critical densities of , hcn j=43 , and cs j=76 are 1.8 , 8.5 , and 2.9 @xmath83 @xmath5 , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "concerning to the c@xmath1h j=43 line , as done in n113 ( paperi ) , we analyse the measured fwhm @xmath27v of the peaks and compare with the analysis presented in @xcite towards a galactic sample of star - forming regions in different evolutionary stages .",
    "the authors showed that the c@xmath1h j=43 lines towards ultracompact hii  regions are significantly broader ( @xmath27v @xmath12 5.5  in average ) than those obtained towards infrared dark clouds and high - mass protostellar objects , i.e. sources representing earlier stages in star formation .",
    "our c@xmath1h @xmath27v values are indeed broad , which is consistent with the position of the molecular observation , almost in coincidence with a bright compact radio continuum source at r.a.@xmath125:39:37.48 , dec.@xmath84:45:26.10 ( j2000 ) @xcite , catalogued as a compact hii  region likely generated by two o4v / o5v stars @xcite .",
    "thus , we are presenting more evidence supporting that the chemistry involving the c@xmath1h in compact and/or uchii  regions in the lmc should be similar to that in galactic ones .",
    "the comparison between the ratios from higher transition and those obtained from the lower one presented in table[ratios ] shows the same trend for both n159 and n113 , i.e. ratios from j=43 are lower than those from j=10 except for @xmath40 in both regions .",
    "the discrepancy between both ratios is more pronounced in n159 than in n133 . on the other side ,",
    "the @xmath40 ratio in the j=43 line in n159 is almost twice the value derived in n113 .",
    "this may suggest an overabundance of hco@xmath30 in n159 that is not evidenced in the lower line ratio , probably due to line saturation effect .",
    "however , as none excitation effects are taking into account in the line ratios , the overabundance statement is far to be conclusive .",
    "the radex results suggest the presence of both cool and warm gas in the analysed region . indeed , the co emission at the observed position likely arises from both , gas at 20 k with a density about @xmath85 @xmath5 , and gas at 80 k with densities between @xmath86 and @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the co column density in the warm gas component is @xmath87 times lesser than in the colder one .",
    "our results for the warm gas component are in close agreement with what was obtained by @xcite , who used the and j=76 , 43 and 10 lines , and some lines of [ ci ] and [ cii ] .",
    "additionally , the radex results for the cs , , hcn , and hnc indicate that it is very likely that their emissions arise mainly from warm gas with densities between @xmath3 to some @xmath4 @xmath5 , which is in agreement with the co warm results .",
    "it is known that the @xmath6 abundance ratio depends on kinetic temperature @xcite . from the obtained column densities we derived @xmath88 ,",
    "which is compatible with warm gas ( t@xmath89 between 50 and 100 k ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , a @xmath6 ratio greater than 1 agrees with an star - forming scenario @xcite , and in particular , our value is very similar to the values obtained towards active cores in galactic infrared dark clouds @xcite . the @xmath6 ratio greater than 1 can be explained by the rapid c @xmath90 hnc @xmath91 c @xmath90 hcn reaction that works as long as the carbon atom abundance is still high @xcite , which seems to be the case , since according to @xcite n159-w has the highest c column density within the n159 complex .",
    "this ratio could confirm , in an independent way , the existence of warm gas in the studied region .",
    "however , we should be cautious with such ratios because the obtained column densities are dependent on the assumed beam filling factor .      in the case of n132 and n166",
    "only and were detected .",
    "the non - detection of higher density gas tracers such as c@xmath2o , n@xmath1h@xmath30 , and dco@xmath30 ( which were observed in our observation run with integration times of 560 and 1440 sec ) may indicate that the density of the molecular gas in these regions is not so high .",
    "this is in agreement with what @xcite concluded for n166 and is consistent with the higher / integrated intensity ratio compared with the denser regions n159 and n113 ( see table[ratios ] ) .",
    "the ratios obtained in n166 are in good agreement with the ratios presented in @xcite using the j=10 line for several clouds of the giant molecular complex-37 . n166-a and -b are about 19  and 27  close to n166-clump 2 and n166-clump 1 belonging to complex-37 @xcite . from an lvg analysis",
    "the authors point out that the studied clumps in n166 have a density between some 10@xmath92 to a few 10@xmath7 @xmath5 with kinetic temperatures between 25 and 150 k. by assuming lte we obtain similar values of t@xmath93 ( between 24 and 30 k ) and and optical depths ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) for n132 and n166 , suggesting that the physical conditions should be similar in both regions .",
    "we have performed a molecular line study towards the lmc hii  regions n159 , n132 , and n166 in the 345 ghz window using aste . we mapped a 24 @xmath0 24 region towards the molecular cloud n159-w in the j=32 line and several molecular lines as single pointings at an ir peak , about 4  close to the position of a myso .",
    "in addition , several molecular lines were also observed towards two positions in n166 and one position in n132 , resulting in positive detections only the and j=32 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    \\(a ) our j=32 map of n159-w is very similar to the map recently presented by @xcite and shows that the molecular peak is shifted southwest compared to the peak of the ir emission .",

    "in addition it was obtained an spectrum of and j=32 towards this position .",
