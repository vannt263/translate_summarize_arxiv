    "recently , the atlas and the cms collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) discovered a new boson @xmath0 in the mass range 125126  gev  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been excluded at 95% c.l . in the mass range 110149  gev , except for the narrow region 122.8127.8  gev  @xcite . the mass range from 127 to 600  gev",
    "was previously excluded  @xcite .",
    "it is also noticeable that the mass @xmath1@xmath2  gev perfectly agrees with the lep precision measurements  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the contact interactions in the processes of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are severely constrained , i.e. , the compositeness scale @xmath5 should be larger than , say , 10  tev  @xcite . against this situation , is there still a room for some strong dynamics responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) ?",
    "we give an overview of typical models with composite higgs bosons .",
    "it might give some hint for the origin of the ewsb .",
    "we will also introduce the isospin symmetric higgs model , which is recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as an example of the dynamical ewsb scenario .",
    "the earliest idea of the dynamical ewsb is technicolor ( tc )  @xcite : the chiral condensate of ( techni- ) fermions is dynamically generated by the technicolor gauge interaction and it breaks the electroweak gauge symmetry , as in low - energy qcd .",
    "the would - be nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons are eaten by the weak gauge bosons . then @xmath6 and @xmath7 acquire their masses proportional to the technipion decay constant ( @xmath8 100  gev ) , which is analogous to the pion decay constant @xmath9  mev in qcd . in order to produce the masses of the sm fermions ,",
    "the extended technicolor ( etc ) has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "although it was beautiful , this old - fashioned tc has been already excluded by several reasons  @xcite .",
    "for example , the constraint of the @xmath10-parameter  @xcite rules out this qcd - like tc with many weak doublets of the technifermions  @xcite .",
    "a modern version of tc is the walking tc where the gauge coupling of the tc gauge group runs very slowly , or `` walks ''  @xcite .",
    "the walking tc resolves the difficulties of the old - fashioned tc .",
    "the estimate of the @xmath10-parameter expected from qcd is not applicable to walking tc . even in walking tc",
    ", however , it is difficult to generate the observed mass of the top quark from the etc interactions without producing unacceptably large isospin breaking .",
    "also , the walking tc usually predicts a heavy composite higgs boson . noticing that the @xmath10-parameter constraint requires a heavy technirho bound state @xmath11",
    ", it is quite nontrivial to get a light composite higgs , @xmath12  gev , and simultaneously to obtain the heavy @xmath11 , say , @xmath13 few tev .    to generate the mass of the top quark , the topcolor dynamics is useful  @xcite . in the topcolor scenario , we assume that the new topcolor interaction strongly couples to the third generation of quarks and then the top quark condensate mainly yields the top quark mass . in the simplest four dimensional model that the top condensate is responsible both for the ewsb and @xmath14 , and that there appears only one ( composite ) higgs doublet , too large top quark mass is predicted , however . in a model with extra dimensions ,",
    "this difficulty is relaxed  @xcite .",
    "another approach to avoid too large top mass is to assume that the top quark condensate is responsible only for @xmath14 and the ewsb takes place by some other mechanism . in topcolor",
    "assisted technicolor ( tc2 ) , the tc interaction causes the ewsb  @xcite .",
    "because the chiral symmetry is extended in tc2 , there appears the extra ng bosons , so - called top - pions .",
    "the masses of the top - pions are generally light and thus they are severely constrained . in a model in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employed a subcritical dynamics ( although nearcritical , i.e. , strong ) for the topcolor interaction , so that the mass of the scalar bound state of the top and the anti - top quarks is naturally heavy .",
    "this mechanism is used in the isospin symmetric ( is ) higgs model recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we introduce the is higgs model in the next section .",
    "the atlas and cms experiments did not only announced the mass of the new discovered boson @xmath0 , but they also reported the nature of @xmath0 : while the decay channels of @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fairly consistent with the sm , the diphoton branching ratio br@xmath17 is about 1.6 times larger than the sm value  @xcite . in the latest results , the atlas collaboration confirmed the similar enhancement in the diphoton channel  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the cms group changed their previous results of the signal strength from @xmath18 to @xmath19 for the mass - fit - mva analysis and @xmath20 for the cut - based analysis  @xcite .",
    "the situation thus becomes unclear at present . in any case , the deviation from the sm in the diphoton channel , if established , would be an indication of a new physics beyond the sm .",
    "let us introduce the is higgs boson model .",
    "the main characteristics of the is higgs boson model are as follows  @xcite : a ) it is assumed that the dynamics primarily responsible for the ewsb leads to the mass spectrum of quarks with no ( or weak ) isospin violation .",
    "_ moreover , it is assumed that the values of these masses are of the order of the observed masses of the down - type quarks . _",
    "b ) the second ( central ) assumption is introducing the horizontal interactions for the quarks in the three families . as a first step , a",
    "_ subcritical _",
    "( although nearcritical , i.e. , strong ) diagonal horizontal interactions for the top quark is utilized which lead to the observed ratio @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the second step is introducing _ equal _ strength horizontal flavor - changing - neutral ( fcn ) interactions between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 quarks and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 ones . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these interactions naturally provide the observed ratio @xmath26 in the second family  @xcite . as to the mild isospin violation in the first family",
    ", it was studied together with the effects of the family mixing , reflected in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .    in this scenario ,",
    "the main source of the isospin violation is only the strong top quark interactions .",
    "however , because these interactions are subcritical , the top quark plays a minor role in ewsb .",
    "this distinguishes the is higgs scenario from the top quark condensate model  @xcite .",
    "one of the signatures of this scenario is the appearance of a composite top - higgs boson @xmath27 composed of the quarks and antiquarks of the third family  @xcite .",
    "note that unlike tc2  @xcite , this class of models utilizes subcritical dynamics for the top quark , so that the top - higgs @xmath27 is heavy in general .",
    "here we also emphasize that while the top - higgs boson @xmath27 has a large top - yukawa coupling , the is higgs boson @xmath0 does not , @xmath28 . on the other hand , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 coupling constants are close to those in the sm .",
    "also , the mixing between @xmath0 and much heavier @xmath27 should be small .",
    "we now describe the decay processes of the is higgs @xmath0 .",
    "it is well known that the @xmath6-loop contribution to @xmath31 is dominant in the sm , while the top - loop effect is destructive against the @xmath6-loop . in",
    "the is higgs model , however , the yukawa coupling between the top and the is higgs @xmath0 is as small as the bottom yukawa coupling , so that the top - loop contribution is strongly suppressed .",
    "the partial decay width of @xmath32 is thus enhanced without changing essentially @xmath15 and @xmath16 . a rough estimate taking the isospin symmetric top and bottom yukawa couplings @xmath33 is as follows : @xmath34 here using the pagels - stokar formula @xcite , we estimated the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the top - higgs @xmath27 as @xmath35 gev , and the vev @xmath36 of the is higgs @xmath0 is given by the relation @xmath37 with @xmath38 gev .",
    "note that the values of the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath39 , e.g. , for @xmath40@xmath41 gev , the suppression factor in the pair decay modes to @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44@xmath45 and the vev @xmath36 of the is higgs @xmath0 is given by the relation @xmath37 with @xmath38 gev .",
    "note that the values of the ratios in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath39 , e.g. , for @xmath40@xmath41 gev , the suppression factor in the pair decay modes to @xmath42 and @xmath43 is @xmath44@xmath45 and the enhancement factor in the diphoton channel is @xmath46@xmath47 . for the decay mode of @xmath48 ,",
    "this model yields @xmath49    the values in eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) agree well with the data in the atlas and cms experiments . however , obviously , the main production mechanism of the higgs boson , the gluon fusion process @xmath50 , is now in trouble .",
    "the presence of new chargeless colored particles , which considered by several authors @xcite can help to resolve this problem .",
    "we pursue this possibility in the next section .",
    "as a benchmark model , we may introduce a real scalar field @xmath10 in the adjoint representation of the color @xmath51 : @xmath52 where @xmath53 represents the is higgs doublet .",
    "the effective lagrangian @xmath54 also contains the is higgs quartic couplings @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath56 . the is higgs mass is @xmath57 , and we will take it to be equal to @xmath58 gev .",
    "the mass - squared term for the scalar @xmath10 is @xmath59 , and should be positive in order to avoid the color symmetry breaking .",
    "typically , @xmath60  gev .",
    "taking into account the @xmath10 contribution to @xmath50 , we find appropriate values of the higgs - portal coupling , @xmath61 as a typical value , we may take @xmath62 for @xmath63  gev and @xmath64  gev .    a comment concerning the is higgs quartic coupling @xmath55 is in order . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs mass 125  gev suggests that the theory is perturbative up to an extremely high energy scale  @xcite . on the contrary , in the present model , when we take a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath65 that reproduces @xmath50 correctly , the quartic coupling @xmath55 will grow because the @xmath66-function for @xmath55 contains the @xmath67 term . also , there is no large negative contribution to the @xmath66-function for @xmath55 from the top - yukawa coupling @xmath68",
    ".    one can demonstrate such a behavior more explicitly by using the renormalization group equations . in fig .",
    "[ lam ] , the running of the coupling @xmath55 is shown . taking a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath69 and the @xmath70-coupling @xmath71",
    ", it turns out that the coupling @xmath55 rapidly grows .",
    "the blowup scale strongly depends on the initial values of @xmath65 and @xmath72 .",
    "a detailed analysis will be performed elsewhere .",
    "last but not least , we would like to mention that other realizations of the enhancement of the @xmath0 production are also possible .    .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to @xmath55 and the sm higgs quartic coupling , respectively .",
    "we fixed the is higgs mass @xmath73  gev and took @xmath69 and @xmath71 .",
    "unlike the sm , the is higgs quartic coupling grows up due to a large higgs - portal coupling @xmath65 and a small top - yukawa coupling @xmath74 .",
    "[ lam],width=283 ]",
    "we gave the overview of the typical scenarios with the dynamical ewsb and also introduced the is higgs boson model .",
    "in particular , the is higgs model can explain the enhanced higgs diphoton decay rate observed at the lhc , and also makes several predictions .",
    "the most important of them is that the value of the top - yukawa coupling @xmath0-@xmath22-@xmath75 should be close to the bottom - yukawa one .",
    "another prediction relates to the decay mode @xmath48 , which is enhanced only slightly , @xmath76 , unlike @xmath32 .",
    "last but not least , the lhc might potentially discover the top - higgs resonance @xmath27 , if lucky . for details , see ref .",
