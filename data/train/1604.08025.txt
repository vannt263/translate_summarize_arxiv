    "the discovery of a skyrmion lattice stimulated great scientific interest in chiral magnets crystallizing in space group @xmath3 , which comprises itinerant b20 compounds such as mnsi@xcite , mn@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xcite , fe@xmath0co@xmath1si@xcite , and fege@xcite as well as the insulator cu@xmath4oseo@xmath5@xcite .",
    "in general , the magnetism in these compounds reflects a well - defined set of three hierarchical energy scales.@xcite exchange interactions and dzyaloshinsky - moriya spin - orbit interactions on the strongest and intermediate scale generate a long - wavelength helical modulation , while higher - order spin - orbit coupling in zero field aligns the pitch of the helices along certain crystallographic directions .",
    "the skyrmion lattice represents a novel form of magnetic order composed of spin vortices with a finite topological winding number .",
    "it appears in a phase pocket , long known as the a phase , just below the helimagnetic transition temperature in small magnetic fields .",
    "the skyrmions arrange in a hexagonal lattice in the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and form skyrmion tubes along the field direction .",
    "the non - trivial topological winding of the skyrmions gives rise to an emergent electrodynamics , in which each skyrmion carries one quantum of emergent magnetic flux , and allows for an efficient coupling of spin currents to the magnetic texture.@xcite in combination with the exceptionally well - defined long - range order@xcite and the resulting weak collective pinning , this coupling permits to drive the skyrmion lattice at ultra - low current densities.@xcite further ways to control skyrmions include magnon flow induced by thermal gradients@xcite or electric fields exploiting the magnetoelectric coupling of the insulating cu@xmath4oseo@xmath5@xcite .",
    "in addition , a distinct set of collective excitations in the ghz range@xcite may be excited electromagnetically@xcite or optically@xcite promising new concepts for microwave devices .    in this context",
    ", the pseudo - binary compound fe@xmath0co@xmath1si is interesting , as it allows to change important parameters drastically by compositional tuning .",
    "helimagnetism is observed in a wide composition range , @xmath6@xcite , whereas the parent compounds fesi and cosi are paramagnetic@xcite and diamagnetic@xcite , respectively .",
    "starting from the strongly correlated insulator fesi,@xcite an insulator - to - metal transition takes place at @xmath7.@xcite due to the comparably high absolute value of the electrical resistivity and an upturn at low temperatures,@xcite helimagnetic fe@xmath0co@xmath1si is often referred to as a strongly doped semiconductor .",
    "this behavior contrasts studies of both the magnetic properties@xcite and the band structure@xcite of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si consistently suggesting itinerant magnetism .",
    "depending on the cobalt content , fe@xmath0co@xmath1si shows helimagnetic transition temperatures between a few kelvin and 50k , while the critical fields vary between a few millitesla and roughly 150mt.@xcite the helix wavelength ranges from about @xmath8 to more than @xmath9.@xcite the crystalline lattice constant decreases almost linearly with increasing cobalt content by less than a percent , from @xmath10 in fesi to @xmath11 in cosi.@xcite hydrostatic pressures suppress the magnetic order with critical pressures of several gpa indicating great sensitivity to changes of the lattice constant.@xcite    easy @xmath12 axes for the helical propagation vector are associated with the cubic anisotropy , however , less pronounced as for the other cubic chiral magnets especially for large cobalt contents.@xcite these studies , in fact , were performed prior to the identification of the a phase in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si as a skyrmion lattice in ref .  .",
    "in the latter study , for @xmath13 neutron scattering intensity was observed everywhere on a sphere in reciprocal space with a modulus of the helical pitch and unexplained broad maxima around @xmath14 akin to the partial order in pure mnsi under hydrostatic pressure.@xcite in addition , it was demonstrated that the magnetic phase diagram is sensitive to the field and temperature history . in particular ,",
    "field cooling through the skyrmion lattice state may result in a metastable survival down to lowest temperatures .",
    "depending on the field direction , the size of the phase pocket of the skyrmion lattice differs and even two skyrmion lattice domains with different in - plane orientation have been observed.@xcite    recently , the metastable skyrmion lattice in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si was exploited in a study combining magnetic force microscopy and small - angle neutron scattering in order to address the topological unwinding of the skyrmions.@xcite when the skyrmion lattice transforms into a topologically trivial structure such as the helical state , the emergent magnetic flux discretely vanishes at certain points .",
    "these sinks of emergent flux act as a zipper between neighboring skyrmion tubes and have been interpreted as emergent magnetic monopoles . due to the suppression of thermal fluctuations at low temperatures , the metastable skyrmion lattice in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si permitted to monitor the intrinsic unwinding mechanisms .",
    "the present study reports comprehensive magnetization , ac susceptibility , and specific heat measurements .",
    "we show that fe@xmath0co@xmath1si , albeit having an electrical resistivity akin to strongly doped semiconductors , may still be discussed as an itinerant magnet .",
    "we determine the magnetic phase diagrams over a wide concentration range and for all major crystallographic directions . despite different transition temperatures and fields ,",
    "these diagrams are qualitatively very similar across the entire concentration range studied .",
    "after zero - field cooling , they resemble that of stoichiometric cubic chiral magnets supporting the helical , conical , and skyrmion lattice phase . at the boundaries between these phases very slow dynamics",
    "are observed , comparable to mnsi@xcite or cu@xmath4oseo@xmath5@xcite .",
    "these dynamics are discussed in view of the different response of moments on the scales of the individual atoms and complex topological unwinding processes , respectively .",
    "in contrast to stoichiometric compounds such as mnsi , however , the helical state is not recovered in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si once a large magnetic field has been applied for all field directions .",
    "moreover , when cooled in an applied magnetic field , the skyrmion lattice phase may persist as a metastable state down to the lowest temperatures . taken together , we show that by choosing a certain cobalt content and applying the appropriate field and temperature history the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si may be adjusted over a wide range providing access to interplay of the effects of disorder in various different constellations .",

    "[ figure07 ] for field along @xmath12 , @xmath14 , and @xmath63 . here , we focus on field values in the skyrmion lattice phase and distinguish four different cooling histories , notably ( i )  zero - field cooling ( zfc , blue ) , ( ii )  field cooling down ( fcd , orange ) , ( iii )  field cooling ( fc , green ) , and ( iv )  high - field cooling ( hfc , red ) .",

    "the signature of the skyrmion lattice state is a minimum at the high - temperature side of the conical plateau . in this pocket just below the onset of long - range order a stable skyrmion lattice forms irrespective of the field and temperature history . when field cooling the minimum may be extended to lower temperatures",
    ". around its low field boundary the skyrmion lattice phase may be enlarged by a few kelvin , while at higher fields the metastable regime may persist down to the lowest temperatures studied .",
    "both the temperature width of the pocket of the skyrmion lattice phase and the magnitude of its metastable extension are largest for field along @xmath12 and smallest for @xmath63 .",
    "the observed phase boundaries , both stable and metastable , are consistent with small - angle neutron scattering data.@xcite after high - field cooling , the helical state is suppressed and the skyrmion lattice state is only present in the stable phase pocket .",
    "we note that as a result , for instance at a field of @xmath65mt along @xmath12 , either the helical state ( after zero - field cooling ) , the skyrmion lattice state ( after field cooling ) , or the conical state ( after high - field cooling ) may be observed at low temperatures .",
    "recently , also the skyrmion lattice in mnsi was metastably cooled down to low temperatures at ambient pressure by exploiting electric heating and subsequent rapid cooling@xcite as well as under hydrostatic pressure.@xcite presumably due to the disorder present in the system , in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si the time scales associated with the unwinding of the skyrmion lattice@xcite are distinctly larger than in mnsi .",
    "thus , typical cooling rates of the order of 1kmin@xmath66 are already fast enough to prevent the decay of the skyrmion lattice at its phase boundary to the conical state . at low temperatures ,",
    "fluctuations are finally no longer sufficient to initiate the unwinding .",
    "the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility , im@xmath30 , depicted in figs .  [ figure07](b ) , [ figure07](d ) , and [ figure07](f ) , is independent of the field and temperature history at the resolution of the present study .",

    "data are shown as a function of internal field , i.e. , after correcting for demagnetization effects .",
    "we distinguish six regimes : helical , conical , skyrmion lattice , paramagnetic  ( pm ) , field - polarized  ( fp ) , and fluctuation - disordered  ( fd ) .",
    "the overall behavior is very similar for the three directions .",
    "the helical state is only observed after zero - field cooling . under field cooling the skyrmion lattice may be extended metastably down to low temperatures . ]    in the following , we present the magnetic phase diagrams as inferred from the susceptibility data .",
    "figure  [ figure08 ] summarizes our findings for fe@xmath0co@xmath1si with @xmath13 under zero - field cooling ( left column ) and field cooling ( right column ) for magnetic field along the major crystallographic axes .",
    "after zero - field cooling , the magnetic phase diagram resembles that of the archetypical cubic chiral magnet mnsi . at high temperatures and low fields , fe@xmath0co@xmath1si is paramagnetic  ( pm ) , at low temperatures and high fields it is field - polarized  ( fp ) .",
    "the two regimes are separated by a crossover at @xmath67 inferred from a shallow maximum in the ac susceptibility . at the transition from the paramagnetic to the long - range modulated states a fluctuation - disordered regime  ( fd )",
    "is observed that is dominated by strongly interacting chiral fluctuations.@xcite    below the helimagnetic ordering temperature , @xmath24 , we observe a helical state at low fields , a conical state at higher fields , and a skyrmion lattice state at intermediate fields just below @xmath24 .",
    "the transition regimes between these phases are characterized by very slow dynamics . at the helical - to - conical transition ,",
    "where we only show @xmath28 and omit @xmath68 for clarity , this effect arises from the slow reorientation of the helical propagation vector . around the skyrmion lattice",
    "we attribute the slow response to the nucleation and topological unwinding processes of the skyrmions resulting in a regime of phase coexistence with finite dissipation , as typically observed at first - order phase boundaries .    a stable skyrmion lattice independent of the cooling history is realized in a single phase pocket just below @xmath24 .",
    "the temperature extent of this pocket is largest for field along @xmath12 and smallest for field along @xmath63 .",
    "the upper critical field of the skyrmion lattice decreases with increasing temperature giving rise to a reentrant conical state . for all crystallographic directions",
    "the temperature extent of the skyrmion lattice state , especially in relation to @xmath24 , is large compared to stoichiometric compounds exhibiting a skyrmion lattice .",
    "other than in mnsi , the critical field of the helical - to - conical transition , @xmath28 , increases in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si with decreasing temperature and is essentially independent of the crystallographic orientation .",
    "instead , the transition between the conical and the field - polarized state at @xmath18 shows a comparably strong anisotropy of about 20% with the smallest value for field along @xmath12 .",
    "still , the anisotropy of the skyrmion lattice phase implies an easy @xmath63 axes for the helical pitch in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si with @xmath13 , although @xmath28 shows no direction dependence .",
    "in contrast , in small - angle neutron scattering intensity maxima along the @xmath14 axes were detected after zero - field cooling.@xcite in combination with the pronounced anisotropy of @xmath18 , these observations suggest that nominally sub - leading crystalline anisotropies have a relatively strong effect on the magnetic ordering .    under field cooling ,",
    "two distinct differences are observed with respect to the behavior after zero - field cooling .",
    "first , the helical state is not recovered once a field larger than @xmath28 has been applied for all crystallographic directions .",
    "similar observations in mn@xmath0fe@xmath1si and mn@xmath0co@xmath1si@xcite suggest that the disorder introduced by the doping has a strong influence on the magnetic anisotropy of the helices and the formation of helical domain walls .",
    "second , under field cooling the skyrmion lattice in fe@xmath0co@xmath1si may be observed as a metastable state down to the lowest temperatures studied .",
    "this behavior is most pronounced for field along @xmath12 and weakest for @xmath63 .",
    "the dense hatching in fig .",
    "[ figure08 ] marks the part of the phase diagram , where the ac susceptibility stays at its lowest value , i.e. , where the metastable skyrmion lattice is most pronounced .",

    "a peak in the specific heat is thereby expected as a clear signature of the first - order transition that coincides with the onset of helical order . within the resolution of our study",
    ", however , we observe no first - order - like anomaly in the specific heat of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si , whereas helical order with pinned helices is detected in small - angle neutron scattering.@xcite    the lack of such a specific heat anomaly contrasts the situation in both the itinerant helimagnets mnsi@xcite and mn@xmath0fe@xmath1si@xcite as well as the local - moment helimagnet cu@xmath4oseo@xmath5@xcite .",

    "in summary , we have studied the magnetization , ac susceptibility , and specific heat of the cubic chiral magnet fe@xmath0co@xmath1si for @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic properties are characteristic of an itinerant magnet with comparably low charge carrier concentration .",

    "moreover , no helical state is recovered once a field large enough to enter the conical state has been applied .",
    "this history dependence of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si in combination with the large compositional range exhibiting helimagnetism permits to tune the temperature , field , and length scale of the magnetic order . in this context , our findings pave the grounds for studies of the interplay of disorder with the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0co@xmath1si in the future .",

    "<S> taken together with the large variation of the transition temperatures , transition fields , and the helix wavelength as a function of composition , this hysteresis identifies fe@xmath0co@xmath1si as an ideal material for future experiments exploring , for instance , the topological unwinding of the skyrmion lattice . </S>"
