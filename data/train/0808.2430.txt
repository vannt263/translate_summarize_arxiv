    "hopping conduction in solids governed by strong electric fields is in the focus of intensive theoretical and experimental study since several decades [ see , for instance , chapter 7 in ref .   and references therein ] . in recent years",
    ", particular interest to this research area has been caused by growing device applications of amorphous organic and inorganic materials in which the incoherent hopping transitions of charge carriers between spatially and energetically distributed localized states dominate the optoelectronic phenomena [ see , for instance , ref .   and references therein ] .",
    "one of the mostly discussed topics is whether the differential negative conductivity ( ndc ) , i.e. , the decreasing conductivity with increasing electric field , is possible in the hopping regime .",
    "the discussion was , to much extent , provoked by the reports on the apparent decrease of the drift mobility with rising electric field at relatively high temperatures and low field strengths in disordered organic materials.@xcite this apparent decrease of the mobility with increasing electric field was reported to be succeeded by the increase of the mobility at higher field strengths .",
    "however , the self - consistent effective - medium theory for drift and diffusion at low electric fields@xcite does not show any decrease of the mobility with increasing field .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite that the apparent decrease of the mobility with rising field at low field strengths is an artifact .",
    "the experimental data were obtained by the time - of - flight technique , in which charge carriers are created close to one surface of a sample with a given thickness @xmath0 and the transient time @xmath1 is measured , which is needed for charge carriers to reach the opposite surface of the sample at a particular strength of the applied electric field @xmath2 . then the drift mobility is calculated as @xmath3 . however , at high temperatures and low electric fields the current transients in the time - of - flight experiments are determined mostly by diffusion of charge carriers rather than by their drift . therefore , using the drift formula one strongly overestimates the mobility .",
    "it is the presence of the field strength in the denominator that leads to the apparent `` increase '' of the mobility at decreasing @xmath2.@xcite if one uses at low fields and high temperatures the diffusion formulas instead of the drift ones , then no decrease of the mobility with increasing field can be claimed at low electric fields.@xcite    this result does not exclude , however , the possibility of the ndc in the hopping regime .",
    "bttger and bryksin@xcite and shklovskii et al.@xcite have suggested analytical theories for the mobility and conductivity decreasing with increasing electric field in various disordered materials .",
    "remarkably , this effect of the negative differential conductivity is to be expected at high field strengths .",
    "this regime succeeds the very strong increase of the mobility with rising field,@xcite and does not precede it at lower fields as claimed on the basis of the drift equations.@xcite    the decreasing conductivity with increasing electric field at high field strengths has been observed experimentally for hopping transport in lightly doped and weakly compensated crystalline silicon .",
    "@xcite the hopping transport mode in such systems at low electric fields had been described theoretically in all detail , @xcite which made these systems particularly attractive for studying the new non - ohmic effects .",
    "shklovskii et al .",
    "@xcite developed an analytical theory , which predicted the ndc effect in the lightly doped weakly compensated semiconductors .",
    "the experimental observations in lightly doped and weakly compensated crystalline silicon appear in qualitative agreement with his theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore computer simulations of levin et al.@xcite confirmed qualitatively the existence of the ndc effect , though no quantitative comparison with the analytical theory @xcite has been attempted .",
    "recent interest in the ndc effect has been caused by its importance for construction of memory devices .",
    "these devices typically contain conducting particles embedded into a nonconductive material .",
    "for such devices , made from both inorganic @xcite and organic @xcite materials , ndc and switching phenomena have been reported . since electrical conduction in the materials , which are currently being tried for device applications , is dominated by hopping of charge carriers , it is necessary to study the possibility of the ndc in this regime in more detail .    in the present paper we report on the theoretical study of hopping transport in high electric fields . in section [ sec - model ]",
    "we describe the theoretical model and briefly outline the analytical approach suggested by nguyen and shklovskii@xcite for the limit of extremely high electric fields . in section [ sec - mc - inf ]",
    "we present our results obtained by straightforward monte carlo computer simulations and show the range of applicability for the analytical theory of nguyen and shklovskii . in section",
    "[ sec - our - theory ] we further develop the analytical theory whereby we improve its agreement with the results of computer simulations .",
    "in particular , the analytical dependence of the drift mobility on the concentration of charge carriers comes in better agreement with the simulation results .",
    "section [ sec - finite ] is dedicated to the ndc .",
    "a new numerical algorithm has been developed to study the ndc effect theoretically .",
    "numerical results obtained in the framework of this algorithm confirm qualitatively the conclusion of nguyen and shklovskii on the possibility of the ndc in the hopping regime .",
    "however , the field dependence of the drift velocity of charge carriers obtained numerically differs essentially from the one predicted so far .",
    "@xcite we suggest in section [ sec - finite ] a further development of the analytical theory , improving essentially its agreement with numerical results .",
    "concluding remarks are gathered in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "aiming to clarify whether the ndc effect is inherent for the hopping transport regime , we consider first , following nguyen and shklovskii,@xcite the simplest possible model  a three - dimensional array of isoenergetic sites with a random spatial distribution with the concentration @xmath4 .",
    "each site can be either empty or occupied by a single electron .",
    "energies of electrons are equal on all sites so that no energy disorder and no electron - electron interactions between different sites are taken into account . only in the final part of section [ sec - finite ] we study the effect of the energy disorder on the ndc .",
    "an electric field @xmath5 is put along the negative direction of the axis @xmath6 , so that the drift velocity of the negatively charged electrons is directed along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "conduction takes place due to tunnelling hops of electrons between the localization sites .",
    "the rate @xmath7 for an electron hop from site @xmath8 to site @xmath9 is determined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance between the sites , @xmath12 is the localization length , @xmath13 is the elementary charge , @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 is the temperature , and @xmath16 are the occupation factors of the sites , @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath18 is related to energy the gain or the energy loss during the jump : @xmath19 in the limit of infinite electric field , the factor @xmath20 $ ] reduces to the heaviside s function @xmath21 .    below we will assume that @xmath22 . as a measure of length , we introduce the typical distance between the neighboring sites @xmath23 .        using this simple model , nguyen and shklovskii@xcite",
    "have shown analytically that the effect of the ndc is inherent for hopping transport .",
    "let us consider briefly their arguments starting from the case of infinitely high fields @xmath2 and extremely small electron concentrations @xmath24 . under such circumstances",
    "each electron can be treated independently from the others and electrons can move only toward the increasing values of their @xmath25 coordinate . in fig .",
    "[ fig - traps ] this is the direction to the right . at each jump ,",
    "an electron moves along the axis @xmath6 to a distance @xmath26 , so that its drift velocity can be estimated as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an average time between jumps ( dwell time ) .",
    "a dwell time @xmath29 for hopping from the site @xmath8 is of the order of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the distance from site @xmath8 to its nearest neighbor `` to the right '' , i.e.  with co - ordinate @xmath25 larger than @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , @xmath31 is the maximum radius of a hemisphere centered at the site @xmath8 that does not contain any other sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig - traps](a ) ) .",
    "if @xmath31 is much larger than @xmath33 ( the typical distance between the neighboring sites ) , such an empty hemisphere can be considered as a trap for electrons .",
    "the contribution of traps with radii in the range @xmath34 $ ] to the average dwell time @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath35 , and also to the probability of the corresponding configuration of sites , @xmath36 : @xmath37 this integral is easy to evaluate , taking into account that the integrand has a sharp maximum at @xmath38 .",
    "consequently one obtains for the current density @xmath39 @xmath40    therefore , one can conclude that in the limit @xmath41 the current is determined by hemispherical traps ( fig .",
    "[ fig - traps]a ) with an `` optimal '' radius @xmath42 .    in the case of finite electric fields ,",
    "a hemispherical trap is not an efficient one , because an electron has a possibility to move in the energetically unfavored directions , and thus to escape the trap ( for example , along the dotted arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig - traps](a ) ) . according to nguyen and",
    "shklovskii,@xcite an `` optimal '' trap for an electron in large though finite electric fields @xmath2 consists of a hemisphere to the right and of a cone to the left of the site on which an electron is captured , with a chain of sites along the @xmath6 axis that provides an easy path into the trap ( fig .",
    "[ fig - traps]b ) .",
    "the height @xmath43 of the cone is chosen so that it is equally hard to escape the trap in all directions taking the chain along the @xmath6 axes into account : @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the smaller is the field , the larger is the volume of a trap with the same dwell time , and consequently the smaller is the probability @xmath45 of finding such a trap .",
    "it means that the average dwell time @xmath46 decreases with decreasing field strength , and concomitantly the current density @xmath47 increases with decreasing field .",
    "this is the essence of the physical mechanism that causes the ndc effect.@xcite to obtain an expression for the current density , one can substitute the volume of the trap shown in fig .  [",

    "the result reads @xmath50.\\ ] ] this is the mathematical expression for the ndc .",
    "the approach leading to this expression is applicable only for fields @xmath51 . in smaller fields ,",
    "the assumption that almost every jump is directed along the axis @xmath6 is violated .",
    "therefore one should expect that eq .",
    "( [ eq - shklovskii10 ] ) overestimates the current density for @xmath52 .",
    "equations ( [ eq - shklovskii5 ] ) and ( [ eq - shklovskii10 ] ) are valid only if the concentration of electrons @xmath24 is small as compared to the concentration of `` optimal '' traps , @xmath53 $ ] . in the opposite case , @xmath54 , the `` optimal '' traps are almost always occupied and play a negligible role . in such a case the most important traps , which determine the drift velocity of electrons , are the ones whose concentration is equal to @xmath24 .",
    "one can estimate the electron drift velocity as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a radius of the most important traps , @xmath57 is their dwell time , @xmath58 is their capture crosssection .",

    "the case of almost filled sites , @xmath65 , is similar to the case of almost empty sites , @xmath66 due to electron - hole symmetry .",
    "the current density is a symmetrical function of the electron concentration : @xmath67 .",
    "nguyen and shklovskii@xcite also emphasized that a special consideration is needed for the case of half - filled system , @xmath68 .",
    "they have shown that the concept of directed percolation can be used to obtain the current density at infinitely high electric fields . in the half - filled system",
    "the trapping of electrons does not play any role , because ( due to the electron - hole symmetry ) it does not change the electron concentration on the infinite cluster which is responsible for the current .",
    "current is determined by electron jumps to distances @xmath69 $ ] , where @xmath70 is the percolation threshold of a directed percolation problem .",

    "the above arguments of nguyen and shklovskii@xcite provide an analytical theory of non - ohmic hopping conduction , based on the concept of the trapping - determined transport .",
    "the theory is valid for the case of large electric fields in two concentration ranges : @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "most remarkably , this theory predicts the effect of the ndc .",
    "also a theory for the case of the half - filled system @xmath79 for infinitely high electric fields @xmath80 has been suggested based on the directed - percolation - approach.@xcite    below we present our numerical study of the field - dependent hopping conductivity .",
    "it shows the range of validity for the analytical theory of nguyen and shklovskii.@xcite furthermore , the analytical theory is developed below in order to improve the agreement between the analytical and numerical results .",
    "in order to calculate the electron drift velocity and the current density at high fields , we used a monte carlo approach . in the limit of infinitely high fields the direction of the electron motion",
    "is prescribed .",
    "therefore it was possible to simulate by a monte carlo algorithm the motion of an electron in an infinite medium along the field direction and therefore to avoid any size effects . without loosing generality one can restrict the maximal length of electron transitions involved into the algorithm by a reasonably large value @xmath81 . in order to simulate the @xmath14-th monte carlo step in the electron motion",
    ", one has to store information only about sites inside a layer @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the electron coordinate before the @xmath14-th step .",
    "we have chosen @xmath84 , which provides a possibility to hop to @xmath85 neighbors in average .",
    "for all sets of parameters used in the simulation the size of the optimal trap @xmath86 considered by nguyen and shklovskii was essentially less than @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , the restriction imposed by @xmath81 did not lead to any loss of generality . before making the next step ,",
    "the computer can forget all the information about sites in the layer @xmath87 , but it has to get information about new sites in a layer @xmath88 . as these `` new '' sites did not affect the calculation at all previous steps , they can be created at random .",
    "therefore , each monte carlo step includes not only the choice of a jump , but also a generation of some `` new '' sites and deleting some `` old '' sites . to make their number finite , one should restrict the system size in the directions perpendicular to the field , i.e.  in the plane @xmath89 .",
    "a calculation domain @xmath90 , @xmath91 with periodical boundary conditions in the plane @xmath89 was used .",
    "the motion of a single electron was simulated within the described algorithm in order to evaluate the drift velocity in the limit @xmath92 .    for finite electron concentrations , we perform simulations in a cubic domain with size @xmath93 and with periodic boundary conditions for all three axes",
