    "solvable spin chains have enjoyed a growing popularity in the last few years , due in part to their novel applications to susy yang  mills and string theories  @xcite .",
    "the prime example of such chains is the celebrated heisenberg model describing @xmath0 spins in a one - dimensional lattice with isotropic nearest - neighbors interactions independent of the site .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spin operator of the @xmath3-th site , the sum runs from @xmath4 to @xmath0 ( as always hereafter ) , and @xmath5 . as is well - known , for spin @xmath6",
    "the model   can be exactly solved using bethe s ansatz  @xcite .",
    "several ( partially ) solvable generalizations of the heisenberg chain   with short range interactions ( at most between next to nearest neighbors ) have been subsequently proposed in the literature .",
    "these include , in particular , the family of chains with arbitrary spin and nearest - neighbors interactions polynomial in @xmath7 of refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as several models whose ground state can be written in terms of `` valence bonds ''  @xcite .",
    "a different type of solvable spin chain with long - range position - dependent couplings was introduced independently by haldane  @xcite and shastry  @xcite .",
    "this chain describes a system of @xmath0 spins equally spaced on a circle , such that the strength of the interaction between each pair of spins is inversely proportional to their chord distance .",
    "the motivation for introducing the hs chain   was the fact that its exact ground state coincides with gutzwiller s variational wave function for the hubbard model  @xcite when the strength of the on - site interaction tends to infinity .",
    "we shall write the haldane  shastry ( hs ) hamiltonian as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the operator exchanging the @xmath3-th and @xmath10-th spins .",
    "although the particles spin in the original hs chain was assumed to be @xmath6 , one can more generally consider particles with @xmath11 internal degrees of freedom transforming under the fundamental representation of @xmath12 . in this case",
    "the spin permutation operators can be written in terms of the fundamental @xmath12 generators @xmath13 at each site @xmath14 ( normalized such that @xmath15 ) as @xmath16 note that for spin @xmath6 particles ( @xmath17 ) , we have @xmath18 .    the hs chain is naturally related to the scalar sutherland model of @xmath19 type @xcite and its spin version introduced in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in fact , polychronakos  @xcite noted that the complete integrability of the hs chain could be deduced from that of the spin sutherland model by suitably taking the strong coupling limit ( the so - called `` freezing trick '' ) .",
    "moreover , the latter author applied this technique to construct an integrable spin chain related to the calogero ( rational ) model of @xmath19 type  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of this chain , usually referred to in the literature as the polychronakos ",
    "frahm ( pf ) chain , reads @xmath20 where the chain sites @xmath21 are now the equilibrium positions of @xmath0 particles in the scalar part of the potential of the calogero spin model of @xmath19 type .",
    "in particular , the sites of the pf chain are not equally spaced , unlike those of the hs chain . indeed , frahm  @xcite pointed out that the sites of the pf chain are the zeros of the @xmath0-th hermite polynomial , which satisfy the system of algebraic equations @xmath22    it turns out that both the hs and the pf chains , featuring long - range position - dependent interactions , can be solved in a more detailed and explicit way than the chains of heisenberg type , characterized by the short range and position independence of the interactions .",
    "for instance , the partition function of the models   and   can be evaluated in closed form for arbitrary @xmath0 using the freezing trick  @xcite , and its expression is relatively simple in both cases .",
    "the spectrum , which consists of a set of integers ( consecutive in the case of the pf chain ) , is highly degenerate due to an underlying yangian symmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been recently shown that even for moderately large @xmath0 the density of eigenvalues of the hs chain is gaussian to a high degree of approximation , and that the density of spacings between consecutive levels follows a simple distribution different from the usual poisson or wigner laws  @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is strong evidence that these results also hold for other spin chains of haldane  shastry type , as e.g.  the @xmath23 or the supersymmetric versions of the original hs chain  @xcite .    in this paper we shall consider a novel type of spin chain , which in some sense is intermediate between the heisenberg and the polychronakos",
    " frahm chains .",
    "its hamiltonian is obtained from that of the pf chain  - by retaining only nearest - neighbors interactions , namely @xmath24 where the sites @xmath25 are defined by restricting the sum in eq .",
    "to nearest neighbors : @xmath26 in the previous equations we are identifying @xmath27 with @xmath28 , @xmath29 with  @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we shall see that the chain   possesses several remarkable properties , whose study is the purpose of this paper . in the first place ,",
    "the spin chain   is related along the lines of the freezing trick to the spin dynamical model @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and we have identified @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have shown in our recent papers  @xcite that an infinite proper subset of the spectrum of the hamiltonian   can be computed in closed form , so that this model is _ quasi - exactly solvable _ ( qes )  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian   is a spin version of the qes scalar model @xmath38 introduced in  @xcite by auberson , jain and khare . in particular , it was shown in the latter reference that @xmath39 is the ground state function of the model  , with eigenvalue @xmath40 .",
    "we shall prove that the sites @xmath25 of the chain   are in fact the coordinates of the unique maximum of @xmath41 in the domain @xmath42 by numerically solving eq .",
    ", we shall see that for sufficiently large @xmath0 the chain sites are normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "we shall present a simple deduction of this property based on the analysis of the continuous limit of the algebraic system   as @xmath43 . as a byproduct",
    ", we shall obtain an analytic formula providing a very accurate approximation to the sites coordinates , valid even for moderately large values of @xmath0 .",
    "another nontrivial consequence of this formula is the fact that for large @xmath0 the strength of the coupling between the spins @xmath3 and @xmath44 as a function of their mean coordinate @xmath45 also follows the gaussian law , but with zero mean and variance @xmath6 .",
    "the spectral properties of the spin chain hamiltonian   are also remarkable . indeed , by a suitable modification of the freezing trick one can show that @xmath46 possesses the eigenvalues @xmath47 for arbitrary values of @xmath0 and  @xmath11 , and exactly compute their corresponding eigenstates . our numerical simulations evidence that these energies are the three lowest ones , and that for spin @xmath6 none of the remaining eigenvalues of @xmath46 are integers ( for which the chain   reduces to the pf chain , whose eigenvalues are known to be integers ) , and @xmath48 ( for which our numerical simulations indicate that all the eigenvalues are also integers ) .",
    "therefore , in the rest of the paper we shall exclude these special cases from our discussion . ] . for @xmath49 , the spectrum of @xmath46",
    "also contains the integer eigenvalue @xmath50 , which appears to be not the fourth but the fifth lowest energy .",
    "the above properties suggest that the model   could be regarded as a quasi - exactly solvable chain , in the sense that only a certain number of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath46 can be computed in closed form .",
    "we have also studied the distribution of energy levels of the chain   for a large number of particles .",
    "since the partition function of this chain is not known , we have performed a numerical calculation of the density of levels using the methods of moments  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , in contrast with the typical behavior of spin chains of haldane  shastry type , the distribution of levels clearly deviates from the gaussian law . as an indication of the accuracy of the approximate level density derived via the moments method ,",
    "we have compared its mean and variance with the exact values obtained by taking traces of suitable powers of the hamiltonian . from this discussion",
    "it also follows that for large @xmath0 the mean and variance of the energy behave as @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , just as for the trigonometric chains of hs type in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : sites ] we study the distributions of the chain sites and the couplings , comparing the results obtained with those for the pf chain .",
    "section  [ s : qes ] , which is the core of the paper , is devoted to the determination of the integer eigenvalues of the chain   and their corresponding eigenstates .",
    "we also present in this section a detailed example for the case of @xmath53 particles of spin @xmath4 , which motivates a number of conjectures on the degeneracy of the integer levels . in section",
    "[ s : stas ] we use the method of moments to approximately compute the density of levels of the chain  @xmath46 , showing that it follows a wigner - like law .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : conc ] we summarize our conclusions and outline possible future developments . for the reader s convenience , in appendix  [ appa ] we present some background material on the exact eigenfunctions of the spin dynamical model   used in section  [ s : qes ] , while in appendix  [ appb ]",
    "we include an overview of the method of moments .",
    "we shall start this section by proving that the sites of the chain   are the coordinates of the unique maximum in the domain   of the ground state function   of the scalar hamiltonian  .",
    "it is convenient to write the ground state as @xmath54 where @xmath55 has the same extrema as @xmath41 and is independent of @xmath56 .",
    "thus the equations   defining the chain sites are just the conditions for @xmath57 to be a critical point of @xmath58 .",
    "the existence of a maximum of @xmath58 in @xmath59 is clear , since it is continuous in @xmath59 and tends to @xmath60 both on its boundary and as @xmath61 .",
    "uniqueness follows from the fact that the hessian of @xmath58 is negative definite in @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , by gerschgorin s theorem  @xcite , the eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath58 at @xmath62 lie in the union of the intervals @xmath63\\ , , \\quad\\text{where } \\gamma_i=\\sum_{j\\neq i}\\big|\\,\\frac{{\\partial}^2 { \\lambda}}{{\\partial}x_i{\\partial}x_j}\\,\\big|\\,.\\ ] ] since @xmath64 \\frac{{\\partial}^2{\\lambda}}{{\\partial}x_i{\\partial}x_{i\\pm1}}=(x_i - x_{i\\pm1})^{-2},\\qquad \\frac{{\\partial}^2{\\lambda}}{{\\partial}x_i{\\partial}x_{j}}=0\\;\\text { if } \\;j\\neq i , i\\pm1,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we have @xmath65 and thus all the eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath58 are strictly negative .",
    "since @xmath58 and @xmath59 are invariant under the transformation @xmath66 and @xmath58 has a unique maximum in @xmath59 , it follows that @xmath67 so that the chain sites are symmetric about the origin . in particular , the center of mass of the spins vanishes , i.e. , @xmath68    we have numerically solved equations   for the chain sites for up to 250 spins . before presenting our conclusions , a remark on the configuration of these sites is in order .",
    "the attentive reader might have been surprised by our claim that the chain   features only nearest - neighbors interactions , in spite of the fact that the first spin interacts with the last one .",
    "we can avoid this objection by regarding the site coordinate @xmath25 as an arc length in a circle of radius @xmath69 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sites20 ] . in this way",
