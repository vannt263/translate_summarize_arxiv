    "<S> we monitor the evolution of the structure under shear by considering the pair correlation function @xmath10 , the distribution of the number of contacts each sphere has , and the free volume distribution , each of which exhibit unique signatures near the jamming point for frictionless sphere packings : the pair correlation function exhibits a near - contact power law singularity @xmath11 and singularities in the ( split ) second peak @xcite . </S>",
