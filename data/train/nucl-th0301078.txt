    "partial restoration of chiral symmetry in a nuclear medium , to which the reduction in the mass of a bound nucleon is sometimes ascribed , plays a key role in understanding the medium modification of bound nucleon ( hadron ) properties . at relatively high energies and/or temperature and/or densities , quark and gluon degrees of freedom",

    "is known to be quenched  @xcite ( enhanced  @xcite ) in gamow - teller ( first - forbidden ) nuclear @xmath5 decay , and a change in the charge radius of a bound proton provides a natural suppression of the coulomb sum rule @xcite .",
    "one of the most famous nuclear medium effects  the nuclear emc effect @xcite , or the change in the inclusive deep - inelastic structure function of a nucleus relative to that of a free nucleon  has stimulated theoretical and experimental efforts for almost two decades now which seek to understand the dynamics responsible for the change in the quark - gluon structure of the nucleon in the nuclear environment  @xcite .",
    "recently the search for evidence for some modification of nucleon properties in medium has been extended to electromagnetic form factors , in polarized @xmath6 scattering experiments on @xmath7o  @xcite and @xmath1he  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the equivalence of the averaged resonance and scaling structure functions appears to hold for each resonance region , over restricted intervals of @xmath22 , so that the resonance  scaling duality also exists locally .",
    "these findings were dramatically confirmed in recent high - precision measurements of the proton and deuteron @xmath0 structure function at jefferson lab @xcite , which demonstrated that local duality works remarkably well for each of the low - lying resonances , including surprisingly the elastic , to rather low values of @xmath23 .    in this article",

    "the suppression of this component in a bound nucleon is assumed to be the main source of the emc effect .",
    "this model represents one of the extreme possibilities that the emc effect is solely the result of deformation of the wave function of bound nucleons , without attributing any contribution to nuclear pions or other effects associated with nuclear binding @xcite .",
    "the deformation of the bound nucleon structure function in the plc suppression model is governed by the function @xcite : @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the bound nucleon momentum , @xmath175 is the nuclear binding energy , and @xmath1760.6  gev is a nucleon excitation energy in the nucleus .",
    "for @xmath177 the ratio of bound to free nucleon structure functions is then given by @xcite : @xmath178 the @xmath24 dependence of the suppression effect is based on the assumption that the point - like configuration contribution in the nucleon wave function is negligible at @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) , and for @xmath181 one linearly interpolates between these values @xcite .",

    "the effect is a suppression of order 20% in the ratio @xmath183 for @xmath1840.7 .",
    "in contrast , the ratios extracted on the basis of duality , using the qmc model constrained by the @xmath1he polarization transfer data  @xcite , show almost no suppression ( @xmath1852% ) in this region . thus , for @xmath1he , the effect in the plc suppression model",
    "is an order of magnitude too large at @xmath184 , and has the opposite sign for @xmath186 .",
    "although the results extracted from the polarization transfer measurements  @xcite rely on the assumption of local duality , we stress that the corrections to duality have been found to be typically less than 20% for @xmath187  gev@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the results therefore appear to rule out large bound structure function modifications , such as those assumed in the point - like configuration suppression model @xcite , and instead point to a small medium modification of the intrinsic nucleon structure , which is complemented by standard many - body nuclear effects .",
    "nevertheless , given the large differences between the theoretical predictions , data on nuclear structure functions at large @xmath24 would be extremely valuable in discriminating between these scenarios .",
    "possible insights into the medium modifications of bound nucleon structure functions may be garnered from semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering experiments from deuteron , by studying the spectrum of tagged spectator nucleons @xcite . as a consistency check on the analysis",
    ", one can also examine the change in the form factor of a bound nucleon that would be implied by the corresponding change in the structure function in medium .",

    "the result is a suppression of about 20% in the ratio @xmath198 at @xmath1532  gev@xmath16 ( solid curve ) . since the structure function suppression in the plc model depends on the nucleon momentum ( eq .",

    "as expected , the effect is reduced , however , it is still of the order 15% since the suppression also depends on the binding energy , as well as on the nucleon mass , which changes with density rather than with momentum . in contrast , the qmc calculation , which is consistent with the mami @xmath1he quasi - elastic data , and jlab polarization transfer measurements on @xmath1he  @xcite , produces a ratio which is typically 510% _ larger _ than unity ( dashed ) . without a very large compensating change in the in - medium electric form factor of the proton ( which seems to be excluded by @xmath4-scaling constraints ) , the behavior of the magnetic form factor implied by the  plc model @xmath200 duality \" would produce a large _ enhancement _ of the polarization transfer ratio , rather than the observed small suppression  @xcite ( see eq .",

    "recent experimental results  @xcite from polarized proton knockout reactions off @xmath1he nuclei have provided the first direct evidence for a possible small but nonzero modification of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the nuclear medium . the analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite found that when compared with conventional nuclear calculations , the medium modifications observed in the @xmath1he data could only be accounted for within models in which the conventional descriptions are supplemented by a small modification of the nucleon form factors in medium calculated in the qmc model  @xcite ( see also ref .",

    ", the empirical evidence suggests that for low moments of the proton s @xmath0 structure function the duality violations due to higher twist corrections are @xmath201 for @xmath202  gev@xmath16 @xcite , and decrease with increasing @xmath23 . in the context of the qmc model ,",
    "the change in nucleon form factors allowed by the data imply a modification of the in - medium structure function of @xmath1852% at @xmath169 for all nuclear densities between nuclear matter densities , @xmath136 , and @xmath134 .    the results place rather strong constraints on models of the nuclear emc effect , especially on models which assume that the emc effect arises from a large deformation of the nucleon structure in medium .",
    "while suggesting the need for explicit quark degrees of freedom in the nucleus , our findings appear to disfavor models with large medium modifications of structure functions as viable explanations for the nuclear emc effect , although it would be desirable to have more data on a variety of nuclei and in different kinematical regions .",
    "a such proposed experiment @xcite at jefferson lab on @xmath7o at @xmath15  gev@xmath16 , which would make use of other , high precision cross section data at this momentum transfer , would have about 15 times the statistics of the original commissioning experiment  @xcite .",
