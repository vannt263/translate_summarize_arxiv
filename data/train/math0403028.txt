    "we study framed knots , configured as knotted ribbons , where a ribbon is a space homeomorphic to a rectangle .",
    "think of that rectangle as a long strip of paper , and imagine tying a knot in the strip and then pulling it gently tight so that it becomes a flat folded knotted strip .",
    "see figure 3 for an illustration of this process for the trefoil knot .",
    "the folds in the strip should all be of the type shown in figure 2 .",
    "the question about such knots is this : what is the least length of strip ( for a given width ) needed to make a flattened version of the knot ?",
    "this question , about length to width ratio for flat knots , is analogous to a question about length to radial width ( so - called _ thickness _ ) for knotted tubes embedded in three dimensional space .",
    "the question for knotted tubes has a good - sized recent literature @xcite , but to this date there is no specific conjecture for the exact thickness of even the trefoil knot . in the present paper ,",
    "we make specific conjectures for minimal length to width ratio for the trefoil and figure eight as knotted flat ribbons .",
    "it is clear from this initial exploration of knotted ribbons that there is much to think about and very interesting relationships between geometry and topology in this domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives our mathematical model for flat knotted ribbons , in terms of immersed piecewise linear ribbons in the plane .",
    "we emphasize two approaches to the length to width ratio , one for closed knots , and one for truncated knots . in section 3",
    "we analyze the geometry of the folded trefoil and conjecture its minimal ratio for the truncated trefoil knot . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the geometry of the folded figure eight knot and conjecture its minimal ratio .",
    "section 5 is a discusssion of possible relationships with fully three dimensional issues .      in figure 1",
    "we depict two knotted ribbons ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) embedded in three dimensional space .",
    "the projection of ribbon @xmath0 to the plane is _ not _ the sort of flattened knot that we are considering here .",
    "the twist in the embedding flattens to a singular projection that we wish to avoid .",
    "the projection of ribbon @xmath1 to the plane is suitable for our purposes .            in figure 2",
    "we provide a mathematical model for the sort of folded strip that we have in mind . in the mathematical model",
    ", there is a piecewise linear curve in the plane with transverse self - intersections .",
    "this curve is the projection of the center - line of the strip to the plane after all folds have been made .",
    "each fold is modeled as follows : consider an angle in the piecewise linear embedding . place a _ mirror segment _ at each angle so that it makes equal angles to each of the parts of the embedding that form the angle .",
    "the two parts of the embedding at the angle now have the appearance of rays being reflected by the mirror segment .",
    "then the image of the folded ribbon in the plane is _ by definition _ a bundle of parallel rays reflected by the mirror segments .",
    "see figure 2 for an illustration of this geometry .",
    "it is assumed that separate straight line bundles intersect either along mirrors , or transversely in the pattern of the self - crossings of the core diagram .",
    "flat ribbon immersion _ is such an immersion of a ribbon into the plane .",
    "a _ flat knotted ribbon _ is a choice of weaving that overlies a flat ribbon immersion .",
    "in such a weaving , the width of any straight interval of parallel rays must be chosen so that _ no bundle of parallel lines can overlap a fold line when it is intended to weave that interval with the intervals meeting at the fold_. such an overlap would be the same as a situation where the bundle of lines overlapped one of the mirrors , and would have to be either entirely over , or entirely under the mirror fold .",
    "such a choice is obtained by first selecting an over or under crossing at each self - intersection of the center - line , and then extending these choices compatibly across the families of reflected rays . in this way , any piecewise linear knot diagram gives rise to a collection of flat knotted ribbons of varying width .",
    "for a given diagram , there will be a unique largest width knotted ribbon .",
    "we would like , within the topological type of a given knot , to determine the least length of ribbon needed for a given choice of width .    in order to discuss the issue of the length of a given knotted ribbon ( for a given width ) ,",
    "there are two choices .",
    "we can assume that the knotted ribbon is in the traditional form of a closed piecewise linear loop , and take the length of the core curve .",
    "this is the _ closed length _ of the knotted ribbon .",
    "alternatively , we can choose to cut and truncate the knotted ribbon and measure the length of the unfolded ribbon that results from the cut .",
    "in some cases , there is a clear way to make the truncation .",
    "for example , in figure 3 we illustrate how a trefoil knot occurs in the form of a woven pentagon . in this form",
    "it is natural to truncate the ribbons flush with the sides of the pentagon .",
    "when there is such a choice , we shall call the resulting length the _ truncation length _ of the knotted ribbon .    in figure 3",
    ", we illustrate the process of forming a trefoil knot and pulling it to make a pentagonal flat knotted ribbon .",
    "we also show the internal mirror structure of this knot .",
    "the edges of a regular pentagon are the mirror segments .",
    "a ray of light enters the pentagon and is reflected three times before exiting . in the diagram , the over and undercrossings of the trefoil knot have been indicated . note",
    "that the pentagonally folded trefoil knot is seen here as a limiting case of flat banded knots whose mirrors are segments on the sides of a regular pentagon .",
    "there is no way , using this particular geometry , to extend the lengths of the mirrors beyond the lengths of the pentagonal sides and still maintain the possiblity of an embedding .",
    "we also show in figure 3 how a totally internally self - reflecting pentagon would behave . in this case",
    "the alternating over and undercrossing pattern is actually not realizable by straight lines in three space , but could be effected by a weaving process , as we have described .",
    "we begin with an experiment that one can perform with the pattern of the trefoil knot and a strip of paper .",
    "tie the strip into a trefoil and pull it gently tight and fold it so that you obtain a flat knot .",
    "as you pull it tight , a regular pentagon will appear .",
    "it is intuitively clear that this pentagonal form of the trefoil knot uses the least length of paper for a given width of paper ( to make a flattened trefoil ) . at this writing",
    ", we do not have a proof of this statement .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to analyze the pentagonal geometry and to make a quantitative version of this conjecture .",
    "we can determine the length to width ratio of the strip of paper obtained from this pentagonal construction , by first cutting the knot exactly along the edges of the pentagon , and then unfolding this strip .",
    "see figure 4 .",
    "the lengths @xmath6 and @xmath7 that label the strip in figure 4 are the edge length @xmath6 and the chord length @xmath7 of the pentagon . to see this , contemplate figure 4 , or better yet , perform the experiment of making the knot , cutting it flush to the pentagon and unfolding the strip .",
    "the length of the whole strip is @xmath8    in figure 4 there is a blown - up picture of the pentagon with the edge - length @xmath6 , the chord @xmath7 and the width of the strip @xmath9 labeled .",
    "you can see that the width is indeed the length of a particular perpendicular dropped to the chord .",
    "it is also apparent from this diagram that @xmath10 thus we can solve for the width @xmath9 of the strip in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath11 the result is                    the small pentagon has its edge @xmath6 and chord @xmath7 labeled .",
    "we embed the small pentagon in the larger one and observe via a parallelogram and by similar triangles that @xmath22 .",
    "thus , with @xmath23 we have @xmath24 whence @xmath25 this is sufficient to show that @xmath26 is the golden ratio .",
    "note how the golden ratio appears here through the way that a pentagon embeds in a pentagon , a pentagonal self - reference .",
    "* it is well - known in recreational mathematics that the trefoil ribbon produces a pentagon @xcite . to our knowledge , this is the first time this construction has been analyzed for its length to width ratio , and it is the first time that the construction has been placed in the context of the search for minimal ribbon length .          in this section",
    "we consider the analogous question for the figure eight knot .",
    "figure 6 illustrates the experiment for the figure eight knot that leads to a flat folded hexagon .",
    "as the figure shows , the hexagon is not regular .",
    "it has two opposite parallel sides of the same length , and four sides that are equal in length to one another .",
    "consider figure 7 , which shows the hexagon formed by the tightened ribbon and the center line of the ribbon ( appearing as five line segments with four folds ) , together with a sixth line segment connecting the starting point ( @xmath33 ) and ending point ( @xmath34 ) of this folded center line .",
    "place the figure on a coordinate plane so that the point @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . since @xmath33 is the midpoint of @xmath38 , we must have @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "finally , since lines @xmath38 and @xmath41 are parallel , @xmath42 on the other hand , @xmath43 because @xmath44 is parallel to @xmath45 , so @xmath46 implying that @xmath47 .",
    "thus @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "now the angle of incidence at @xmath33 equals the angle of reflection , so @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are parallel , so @xmath54 and @xmath55 hence @xmath56 thus @xmath57 is isosceles , so that @xmath58 .          in order to find the width @xmath9 of the ribbon , view figure 8 .",
    "here we observe that @xmath71 is the distance between the parallel lines through @xmath72 and @xmath73 it follows from our coordinate calculations that @xmath74 since @xmath75 from this , and the equality of alternate interior angles between parallel lines , it follows that the three angles indicated by @xmath76 in figure 9 are indeed equal to one another .",
    "that is , @xmath77 it then follows at once that @xmath78 and that @xmath79 hence @xmath80 and so @xmath81          even at the level of the figure eight knot there are other ways to make the folds .",
    "but experiments so far reveal that the @xmath84 ratio is larger for these other constructions .",
    "an example of an alternative fold is shown in figure 9 .",
    "we leave it to the reader to verify that this folding geometry leads to more length than the semi - regular hexagon described above .",
    "some workers have thought about the relationship between thickness for flat knots and thickness for knotted tubes .",
    "for example kusner @xcite informed the author of this paper that one can get an upper bound of the form        it is clear that much more work remains to be done in this field .",
    "the immediate appearance of geomerty , in relation to flattened knotted ribbons , is encouraging .",
    "the problems of minimization discussed in this paper can be explored both theoretically and via computer models .",
    "there should be important and interesting relationships between the structure of ribbons , the structure of ropes , and geometry in three dimensional space .",
    "values such as the minimal ropelength and minimal ribbonlength for knots are fundamental topological quanta associated with the knots .",
    "it is to be expected that such numbers will be related to the geometry , topology and physics of these entities .",
