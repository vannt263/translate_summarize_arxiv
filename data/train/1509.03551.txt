    "wave scattering and energy transport in disordered media have been for long time a matter of great research interest  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of anderson localization in different systems such as optical  @xcite , ultracold atomic gases  @xcite and elastic networks  @xcite , has renewed the research in this direction .",
    "in addition , recent studies on wave scattering in random media have lead to a plethora of applications in imaging , random lasing and solar energy ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the key phenomenon employing in these studies is the spatial wave localization due to disorder , which is a linear effect relying on keeping phase coherence of participating waves  @xcite .",
    "however , wave localization can also emerge due to nonlinearity , as it was first shown in the studies of fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu )  @xcite , and may lead to energy localization and propagation through the formation of localized solutions ( solitons , breathers etc . ) in different lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the interplay of these two localization mechanisms , nonlinearity and disorder    , has been studied extensively in the recent years  @xcite . in most of these studies ,",
    "an initially localized wavepacket was shown to lead to delocalization and a sub - diffusive spreading of the energy , for sufficiently large nonlinearities .",
    "the most common models that have been studied are the klein - gordon ( kg ) model as well as the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) , where especially the latter has attracted much attention due to its application to various optical structures and devices .",
    "experimental studies on optical structures show that nonlinearity can either enhance localization ( for focusing nonlinearity ) or induce delocalization ( for defocusing nonlinearity )  @xcite .",
    "granular solids , namely densely packed arrays of macroscopic particles which appear naturally disordered , are a promising testbed for studying the interplay of disorder and nonlinearity .",
    "the latter originates from the interparticle hertzian contacts  @xcite .",
    "an especially appealing characteristic of these media is their tunable dynamical response ranging from near linear to highly nonlinear , by changing the ratio of static to dynamic interparticle displacements .",
    "fabricated granular solids have allowed the exploration of a plethora of fundamental phenomena , including solitary waves with a highly localized waveform in the case of uncompressed crystal , discrete breathers and others  @xcite .",
    "they have been also applied in various engineering devices , including among others shock and energy absorbing layers  @xcite , acoustic lenses @xcite , and acoustic diodes @xcite .    for sufficiently weak excitations and in the presence of precompression ,",
    "the one - dimensional disordered granular solid , also called granular chain , can be approximated by a disorder harmonic lattice which has some interesting transport properties .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that different initial conditions  initial displacement or momentum excitations  of a single particle can lead to : sub - diffusive ( displacement ) or super - diffusive ( momentum ) energy transport  @xcite , as well as to analytical described asymptotic energy profiles  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for sufficiently strong excitations or in the absence of precompression , the granular chain exhibits two different types of nonlinearity : ( i ) a power nonlinearity stemming from the hertzian contacts and ( ii ) a non - smooth nonlinearity , which is triggered whenever two beads of the chain lose contact ( gap opening ) . the latter is present to a broad class of fragile mechanical systems that loose rigidity upon lowering the external pressure towards zero , such as weakly connected polymers  @xcite and network glasses  @xcite .",
    "it is also present in cracked solids  @xcite .",
    "recently , studies of one - dimensional disordered granular chains have been reported  @xcite . in the absence of precompression , where the _ non - smooth nonlinearity _ is present",
    ", it was shown that if a solitary wave is formed , it features an exponential decay which strongly depends on the degree of randomness  @xcite .",
    "similar results were also reported in a two - dimensional granular solid  @xcite where the decay of the amplitude of the wave front was described using an analogy between disorder and viscoelastic dissipation . on the other hand , in the presence of precompression , the power nonlinearity stemming from the hertzian contacts leads to a fpu like dynamics , which have been studied theoretically in the presence of disorder  @xcite . however , in the case of granular chains , this dynamics can be strongly modified by the presence of the opening of gaps .",
    "thus , the interplay of these two nonlinear mechanisms is of particular interest and it can drastically change the transport properties .     only recently , a study about one - dimensional and precompressed random dimer granular chains  @xcite has reported some features of the energy transport . in this work ,",
    "the authors compare wave dynamics in chains with three different types of disorder : an uncorrelated ( anderson - like ) disorder and two types of correlated disorder . for the anderson - like uncorrelated disorder",
    ", they found a transition from subdiffusive to superdiffusive dynamics depending on the amount of precompression in the chain . in the present work ,",
    "we consider a different kind of uncorrelated disorder ( i.e. polydispersity through disorder in the bead radius ) and we study both displacement and momentum initial excitations , emphasizing their differences and similarities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider polydisperse disordered granular chains composed of spherical beads of the same material and with radii taken from a random distribution .",
    "our motivation is the fact that most of the granular materials occurring in nature and industrial application are composed of a broad range of particle sizes  @xcite . by considering a single central bead excitation",
    ", we study the transport of energy in these disordered granular chains .    in sec .",

    "for @xmath137 the exponent @xmath54 grows and eventually reaches the maximum value of @xmath138 , which is also the corresponding value of @xmath54 of the limiting case of @xmath125 .",
    "we again identify this regime as the highly nonlinear regime .    on the other hand , the mean participation number @xmath58 exhibits similar behavior with the case of initial displacement excitations .",
    "for @xmath139 it saturates to a constant value of about @xmath140 beads , while for @xmath141 it continuously increases .",
    "looking closer to @xmath58 , shown in fig .",
    "[ participation2](b ) we note that the mean participation number reaches the asymptotic constant value of about @xmath140 beads for @xmath142 , i.e. , the near linear regime .",
    "however , for @xmath143 although it seems to saturate to a constant value for long time , finally it starts to deviate and to increase continuously .",
    "this again suggests that there is an intermediate regime for @xmath144 in which energy detrapping is observed .",
    "this is the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "to conclude , compared to the case of displacement initial excitations , there is a difference in the energy transport properties in the intermediate regime that we call weakly nonlinear .",
    "although the mean participation number @xmath58 shows the same behavior , in contrast to the displacement excitations , for momentum initial excitations both the near linear and weakly nonlinear regimes are characterized by an asymptotic value of the parameter @xmath135 , namely the same as to the linear case .",
    "same as in fig .",
    "[ intermediate ] but for different initial momentum excitations @xmath134 .",
    "the top panels correspond to @xmath145 from left to right . ]",
    "another interesting point to be mentioned is that although in the linear case the energy transfer is sub - diffusive or super - diffusive for an initial displacement or an initial momentum excitation respectively , in the highly nonlinear regime and more profoundly in the limiting case of @xmath125 both excitations result in the same behavior of energy transport .",
    "in fact in this limit , not only the asymptotic value of @xmath54 ( as it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite for a disordered dimer ) , but also the dynamics of the derivative @xmath54 of @xmath146 are very similar .",
    "according to the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the asymptotic dependence of the energy moments ( not only @xmath107 ) can be characterized by the asymptotic energy profile of the lattice , at least in the linear case . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in that work , that the energy profile far away from the central excitation has the form of @xmath147 .",
    "the exponent @xmath148 was found to be @xmath149 and @xmath150 for displacement and momentum initial excitations respectively . in fig .",
    "[ lepri ] we show for both displacement ( top panels ) and momentum initial excitations ( bottom panels ) three different instants of the energy profile at sufficiently large times , covering all the dynamical regimes from near linear ( left column ) to highly nonlinear ( right column ) . in the left panels ( near linear regime )",
    "it is readily seen that , in accordance with the predictions for the linear problem , the three profiles overlap indicating the fact that the energy distribution has reached an asymptotic profile which does not change for later times . for comparison ,",
    "we also plot curves ( dashed lines ) with a slope of @xmath151 ( top ) and @xmath152 ( bottom ) .",
    "note also that the energy distribution near the central bead ( i.e.  for @xmath153 in the figure ) is the same for the three different profiles .",
    "this indicates that the energy of these sites also does not change in time , and the mode around the center remains localized .",
    "the top ( bottom ) second column panel of fig .",
    "[ lepri ] , depicts the energy profile for an initial displacement ( momentum ) excitation with @xmath101 ( @xmath154 ) . in this case",
    "it is readily seen that for the initial displacement excitation ( top ) not only the three profiles do not overlap , but also the slopes are not exactly @xmath151 .",
    "this is another indication for the appearance of the weakly nonlinear regime which exhibits nontrivial dynamics .",
    "note that for the momentum excitation ( bottom ) the profiles do overlap .",
    "this is in accordance with the discussion in section v about the asymptotic value of @xmath54 which is the same for both the near linear and the weakly nonlinear regime .",
    "additionally , for both cases of initial conditions , we observe a small but non negligible deviation of the energy around the center , which confirms the fact that the localized mode around the center starts to loose its energy .    for larger values of the initial condition as is shown in the top ( bottom ) third column panel of fig .",
    "[ lepri ] , the profile of the energy is substantially different .",
    "it is characterized by two different regimes : a weakly localized part with almost @xmath155 beads with similar amount of energy , forming an almost straight horizontal line and a decaying tail .",
    "however , the weakly localized portion of the energy is spreading and loses its energy , as for larger times the almost straight horizontal part of the profile becomes longer having smaller energy values .",
    "we also note that once again the slope of the energy profiles for initial displacements ( top panel ) is not @xmath151 as time increases but interestingly enough it reaches a value which is closer to @xmath152 ( see gray solid line ) .",
    "we remind that for this initial displacement excitation with @xmath93 , @xmath54 asymptotically reaches the value of @xmath156 ( see fig .",
    "[ singsite ] ) which is also the asymptotic value of @xmath54 of an initial momentum excitation of the linear problem .    finally for the particular case of @xmath125 , as shown in the top ( bottom ) fourth column panel of fig .",
    "[ lepri ] , the asymptotic energy profile is similar to a ballistic propagation where the energy differences between excited beads decrease drastically but in this case the propagating front does not exhibit a sharp profile .",
    "in fact this front has a very large `` tail '' which is due to the shock - like structure that was mentioned in section c.",
    "in this work we numerically investigated the energy transport in a one - dimensional granular solid composed of spherical beads of randomly distributed radii which interact via hertzian forces .",
    "we studied the dynamics by using two different localized initial conditions i.e.  initial displacement and initial velocity excitations of the central bead of the chain and by increasing the amplitude of these excitations .",
    "we were able to identify three different dynamical spreading regimes with distinct characteristics : the near linear , the weakly nonlinear and the highly nonlinear .    in the near linear regime ,",
    "part of the initial energy remains localized around the central excited bead while two counter - propagating fronts , coherent phonons , travel through the chain .",
    "we found that the energy transport is identical to that of a linear chain , with either mass or coupling disorder , at least up to the time scales reached in our simulations .",
    "the spreading of the energy is characterized by an asymptotic time dependence of the mean second moment of the energy @xmath107 of the form @xmath157 , where @xmath57 and @xmath135 for an initial displacement and an initial momentum excitation respectively .",
    "additionally , the mean participation number @xmath58 in this regime , converges to a constant value , which depends on the strength of the disorder .    for larger values of the initial conditions , in the weakly nonlinear regime",
    ", we found that for initial displacement excitations the energy spreading does not exhibit a clear asymptotic time dependence .",
    "however it does cross to a super - diffusive behavior , since for large enough timescales , the slope of @xmath107 becomes larger than 1 .",
    "in fact this behavior , which was also observed in the recent study of  @xcite for an fpu lattice , is found to be closely connected with the nonlinear dynamics of the localized state formed around the central spherical bead .",
    "we found that after a sufficient time interval ( between @xmath155 and @xmath158 normalized time units ; see eq.([norm ] ) ) , the central localized region consisting of about @xmath90 beads , starts to delocalize and the energy stored in these spherical beads starts to radiate into the system . in this weakly nonlinear regime , the dynamics is governed by the power hertzian nonlinearity . on the other hand , for initial momentum excitations , the slope of @xmath107 remains around @xmath156 , as in the near linear regime , but @xmath58 exhibits the same behavior as for displacement excitations .    for even larger amplitudes of the initial excitation ,",
    "the energy transfer becomes substantially different .",
    "the energy profile of the chain reveals an almost ballistic behavior with an almost equal distribution of the energy around the excited portion of the chain . in this regime , which we characterized highly nonlinear , the system exhibits a large number of opening of gaps between beads , which is a nonsmooth nonlinear process .",
    "we found that these gaps propagate in the chain , and that the transport of energy is mediated by a shock - like structure , which bares similarities with the selfsimilar solution found in  @xcite .",
    "an important result of our work is the following : although it is known that the energy transport for the disordered _ linear _ chain strongly depends on the type of initial conditions ( i.e. displacement or momentum excitations ) , we found that in the _ highly nonlinear _ regime it is independent of the initial condition .",
    "this is a rather general feature of disordered granular chains as it was very recently observed in different disordered dimer granular chain  @xcite . in particular , in the linear case",
    "the asymptotic time dependence of @xmath159 shows a slope of @xmath57 ( displacement ) and @xmath135 ( momentum ) , while for the extreme nonlinear limit of @xmath125 both initial conditions lead to a slope of @xmath160 . additionally",
    ", the energy profiles in this regime show that there is no distinct localized state .",
