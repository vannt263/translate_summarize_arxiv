    "it has been shown that a particle bunch that is modulated in radius or hosed does radiate tctr even when the total current of the bunch remains unmodulated .",
    "the radiation is emitted due to the retardation effect : the observer located in the transverse plane sees signals of particles traversing the conductor plate at retarded times .",
    "the integral of this retarded current does show a time dependance at the bunch modulation period .",
    "an axisymmetric particle bunch with a periodically modulated radius emits axisymmetric waves . on the contrary , a hosed bunch whose centroid oscillates in a transverse plane emits in a direction perpendicular to this plane and does not emit in the plane of hosing . in both cases , the field of the coherent radiation scales linearly with the bunch current and is proportional to the modulation amplitude .",
    "the tctr is emitted only when the bunch radius is smaller than or comparable with the radiation wavelength .",
    "the emission is maximized when the bunch radius is @xmath90 , because in this case the retardation effects maximize while the coherence is not yet affected by the finite bunch radius .",
    "the numerical simulations suggest that plasma - modulated sps proton bunches may emit tctr fields at the characteristic amplitudes of 100 kv / m .",
