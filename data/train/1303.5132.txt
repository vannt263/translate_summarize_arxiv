    "the current advances in mobile technology has increased the interest in mobility data analysis in several application domains .",
    "very simple actions as carrying a mobile phone , check emails or to log in social networks software may register the trace of an object .",
    "some devices specially developed for tracking like gps or sensor networks may capture the movement of people , animals , cars , boats , buses and natural phenomena like hurricanes , storms , etc . the traces collected by such devices are called trajectories of moving objects",
    ".    trajectory data , in general , are raw data , basically containing the identity of the moving object , its position and time .",
    "information as speed , acceleration and direction of the movement can be easily extracted from trajectories .",
    "several data mining methods have been proposed for discovering different types of trajectory patterns , as groups with similar characteristics @xcite , chasing @xcite , flocks @xcite @xcite , sequential patterns @xcite , periodic patterns @xcite @xcite and trajectory outliers @xcite e @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are specially interested in trajectory outliers , which are movements that are typically different from the majority of the trajectories in a dataset .",
    "trajectory outliers can be interesting to discover suspicious behavior in a group of people , to find alternative routes at rush hours in traffic analysis , the best or worst path that connects two districts or regions in a city , fishing vessel or cargo trajectories that scape from their normal route .",
    "outlier discovery can also be interesting in animal movement analysis , to find trajectories that move away from the group , or in soccer analysis , for defining strategies for players to scape from marking .",
    "existing works for trajectory outlier detection search for patterns in the whole dataset , comparing all trajectories to find those that behave differently from the rest of the group , that are distant from other trajectories or move in different directions .",
    "lee in @xcite partitions the trajectories in line segments , and outliers are those segments that are distant from the others .",
    "the work of yuan @xcite differs from @xcite on the way as trajectories are partitioned .",
    "ge in @xcite divides the space in grids and classifies as outliers the trajectories that are in grids with low density of trajectories .",
    "none of the existing approaches consider time , therefore , the discovered outliers are spatial , and no further analysis is performed over the patterns .",
    "time analysis may be very interesting for several applications . in a touristic city , for instance , with high season in january and february , the flow of people at this period will be very different from the rest of the year .",
    "the rush hours during the high season may be very different from the normal period , and to find outliers and their meaning can give more possibilities to the decision maker .",
    "while existing approaches search for outliers in the whole trajectory dataset , we address the problem from a different perspective , aiming to discover outliers among trajectories that have the same goal , i.e. , trajectories that move between the same regions . in a traffic management application , for instance ,",
    "one may be interested in finding groups of objects that move together from one region to another in the city , building the most frequent path , and those trajectories that make a different movement between the same regions . in a touristic city , for instance , to find the most standard path followed by tourists to move around the touristic regions and to discover the trajectories that take alternative and more efficient routes may reveal new points of interest for bus lines , taxi points , emergency routes , etc .",
    "figure  [ fig : expadrao ] shows some examples of outliers .",
    "there are four trajectories that move from region @xmath0 to region @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : expadrao](a ) , trajectories @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are close to each other , using the same path to move from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , characterizing a standard path .",
    "trajectory @xmath5 is far from the group , so we can say that it used a different route , avoiding the rest of the trajectories and becoming an outlier .",
    "if we consider that @xmath0 is a shopping center area in a city and @xmath1 is the downtown region , we may assume that @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 followed the most frequent route to move between the regions while @xmath5 used an alternative way in its movement .",
    "figure  [ fig : expadrao](b ) shows an example where trajectories @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 followed the same path , while @xmath5 took an alternative route in the middle of the way from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : expadrao ] ( c ) and ( d ) , the trajectories @xmath3 and @xmath4 followed the same path , while @xmath2 and @xmath5 at some time have chosen a different way .",
    "in this paper we define three novel types of trajectory patterns : standard path , semantic spatial outliers and semantic spatio - temporal outliers .",
    "an algorithm named tra - sod ( trajectory semantic outlier detection ) to find the patterns and to enrich their meaning is presented . in summary , we make the following contributions in relation to existing approaches :    * define new types of trajectory patterns .",
    "* find both the standard path and the outliers between regions , in both directions .",
    "* define a new algorithm for discovering spatial and spatio - temporal semantic outliers . *",
    "add meaning to the patterns in an automatic way , analyzing information as duration , traveled distance , stops , and different time granularities .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 presents the related works , section 3 presents the main definitions and the algorithm tra - sod , while section 4 presents experiments on real trajectory data .",
    "finally , section 5 concludes the paper and suggests directions of future research .",
    "by simply analyzing the physical properties of trajectories it is possible to extract several characteristics about the movement of an object , such as acceleration , speed , displacement , and position .",
    "such information can be used to classify trajectories in pedestrians , cars , ships or planes @xcite . this same information can also be used to cluster trajectories @xcite , where those in the same cluster have similar position , velocity and direction .",
    "some works are concerned only with the position of the trajectory in space and time . in this case , the aim is in finding groups of trajectories that move together , like the moving flock @xcite @xcite and the moving cluster @xcite . in the moving flock ,",
    "the group of trajectories that move together is the same during the entire pattern . in the moving cluster ,",
    "group members can change since the group keeps a minimum density .",
    "these works could be used to find the standard path which connects regions , but apart from not considering regions , the objects in the group must be synchronized during the whole movement , what is not the case in our proposal .",
    "other methods to group trajectories include @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the proposal is to extract mobility profiles of moving objects , and for this purpose the method analyzes the trips ( or movements ) that are close in the space .",
    "the similar trips are grouped and the central element of each group , called routine , is used to represent the group .",
    "the set of routines of a moving object forms its mobility profile .",
    "this work evaluates the trajectories of the same object , while in our case the identity of the object is not important .    the works @xcite and @xcite consider regions of interest in their analysis . in @xcite",
    "a method is proposed to find sequences of places frequently visited by groups of objects .",
    "this method finds the regions of interest considering spatial density or the user can inform these regions .",
    "this method groups the trajectories which have similar travel time , i.e. , the pattern contains the trajectories which have similar duration to move from one region to another , but the shape of the trajectories that move between the regions ( if they move together or not , if they are outliers or not ) is not analyzed .",
    "only the travel time is important in this work .",
    "other papers as @xcite and @xcite try to find the paths most frequently used by the moving objects .",
    "@xcite maps the trajectories to the streets and analyzes the streets .",
    "the sequential patterns are the sequences of roads most frequently used by the moving objects .",
    "this approach could also be interesting to find the standard path between regions , but it works only for trajectory data which overlap road networks , and would not be appropriate for trajectories of animals , people in a park , planes , ships and other applications without a road map .",
    "indeed , no regions of interest are considered here .",
    "the work of @xcite was developed for car traffic analysis on road networks .",
    "the history of cars moving at different roads is analysed for different timestamps .",
    "the cars that behave different from the majority of cars moving on each road at a time are classified as temporal outliers .",
    "the algorithm proposed by @xcite finds trajectories that avoid or deviate from target objects as surveillance cameras , traffic jams , or other pre - defined static objects .",
    "it verifies for each trajectory if it avoids static objects and if there is a valid path that crosses the region of the avoided object .",
    "this work basically differs from our approach because it analyses individual trajectories and does not consider regions of interest .",
    "knorr in @xcite defines a method for outlier detection in databases , where outliers are the tuples which are distant from other tuples in the same database .",
    "although this work is not related to trajectories , it was the inspiration for defining the concept of neighborhood in our paper .    among the works specifically developed for finding outliers in trajectories",
    "are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both approaches split trajectories in subtrajectories to find outliers .",
    "an outlier is a trajectory partition that is far from the majority of the partitions in the dataset .",
    "the distance is computed based on the position and the direction of each partition .",
    "outliers are the trajectories where a fraction of partitions are outliers , so it must have a certain length to be an outlier . in both approaches",
    "no regions of interest are considered , time is not taken into account and no standard path must exist for trajectories be classified as outliers .",
    "the main difference between these approaches is the way as the trajectory partitions ( subtrajectories ) are generated .",
    "none of these algorithms consider any semantic information or give more meaning to the outliers , so we can say that these are geometric outliers , while our work in this paper focuses on semantic outliers .",
    "some works propose to find outliers in real time trajectories extracted from videos of surveillance cameras , as for instance @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , the space is divided in grids and the trajectories are analyzed according to the sequence of grids where a trajectory passes by .",
    "two ways are used to find outliers : ( i ) when the trajectory intersects grids with low density or ( ii ) when a trajectory follows a direction different from the other trajectories in the same grid .",
    "the problem in this work is that only the entire trajectory is analysed instead of partitions , and several patterns may hold in parts of a trajectory .",
    "indeed , the time dimension is not considered by this approach .",
    "the works presented int this section basically identify a common behavior among groups of trajectories or trajectory outliers .",
    "none of them look for both spatial and spatio - temporal outliers among trajectories that move between the same regions , and do neither compute nor consider a standard path connecting the regions , as we propose in this paper .",
    "indeed , we compare the traveled distance , the duration and the time granularity of both spatial and spatio - temporal outliers with the standards , in order to infer more semantic outliers and classify them in two types : avoidance outliers and stop outliers .",
    "this section presents the definitions and an algorithm to find semantic outliers from trajectories .      before defining trajectory semantic outliers we present some basic definitions , starting with point .",
    "a point @xmath6 is a tuple @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are spatial coordinates and @xmath10 is the time instant in which the coordinates were collected .    a list of points ordered in time is a trajectory .",
    "a trajectory @xmath11 is a list of points @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "usually the patterns do not hold for the whole trajectory or during the complete trajectory life .",
    "trajectory patterns occur in part of the trajectories , and this is specially true for outliers . therefore , we make use of subtrajectories , that is a concept commonly used in trajectory research .",
    "let @xmath15 be a trajectory .",
    "a subtrajectory @xmath16 of @xmath11 is a list of consecutive points @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on semantic outliers , and therefore the process starts by looking at subtrajectories that have the same goal , or in other words , that perform a similar movement . by analyzing only subtrajectories that have a common intent of movement",
    "increases the certainty of a deviation .",
    "we consider that trajectories that pass by the same regions have a common intent .",
    "for instance , objects that move from one district to another in a city , birds that fly from one country to another , or tourists that visit touristic places have the same intent of movement : to go from one region or place to another one .",
    "figure  [ fig : exparis ] shows an example where a group of trajectories moves from eiffel tower to hotel des invalides .",
    "we can see that these trajectories have the same intent , while the trajectories moving from eiffel tower to palais de la decouverte have different intent or goal .        to find the movements ( subtrajectories ) with similar intent we consider regions of interest .",
    "these regions can have different size and format , depending on the application .",
    "regions of interest can be districts , dense areas , hot spots , important places , etc .",
    "a region can be a pre - defined important place or computed by an algorithm that finds dense areas as dbscan @xcite .",
    "how to find these regions is not the focus of this work , but we consider a region as a polygon .",
    "the use of regions allows filtering from the whole dataset only the subtrajectories that move between regions , and outliers will be searched among these sets , what significantly reduces the search space for outliers .",
    "we call these subtrajectories that move between regions as candidates .",
    "going back to our example of figure  [ fig : exparis ] , the trajectory that moves from eiffel tower to palais de la decouverte might have done an outlier in relation to the trajectories that move from eiffel to hotel des invalides . however",
    ", this outlier in fact would not be an outlier if we consider that it was the intent of the object to move to palais de la decouverte . by considering as start region the eiffel tower and the final region the hotel des invalides ,",
    "the candidates will only be subtrajectories that move between these regions , and discarding from the analysis the trajectory going to palais de la decouverte .",
    "the use of regions of interest apart from being the basis for finding semantic outliers , it significantly reduces the number of trajectories to be analyzed .",
    "we define candidate as the smallest subtrajectory that moves between two regions , i.e. , we take the last point of the subtrajectory that intercepts the first region and the first point that intersects the final region , as shown in figure  [ fig : candidato ] .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be two regions such that @xmath21 and @xmath11 a trajectory .",
    "a candidate from @xmath19 to @xmath20 is the subtrajectory @xmath22 of @xmath11 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "several regions can be considered for analysis , and it is important to notice that one trajectory may generate several candidates among regions , and one candidate may contain others .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : multcandidatos ] , where the same trajectory intersects three regions , and therefore it has three candidate subtrajectories : the subtrajectory that goes from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is a candidate that starts at point @xmath25 and finishes at @xmath26 . from @xmath1 to @xmath27 is the candidate that starts at @xmath28 and finishes at @xmath29 . from region @xmath0 to @xmath27 , @xmath1 is ignored , and a candidate is generated from point @xmath25 to @xmath29 . in this example , the third candidate contains the two previous ones .    in order to find the outliers , candidates are grouped according to the start and end regions .",
    "each pair of regions generates a different group of candidates .",
    "we do not analyze sequences with more than two regions , as for instance the t - pattern @xcite does , since we are not interested in the outliers between sets of regions .",
    "after defining the set of candidates we start looking for outliers . a candidate will be an outlier when it follows a different path in relation to the majority of the candidates from its group .",
    "we can say that a path that is different from the path used by most candidates is of low density , and it has less trajectories in its neighborhood , while a crowded path has many trajectories in its neighborhood . in order to discover these two types of paths",
    "we introduce the concept of neighborhood .        for each point of a candidate",
    "the neighbors are computed .",
    "a candidate is a neighbor of a point if it is close to the point .",
    "if a point has a few candidates in its neighborhood , then at that time the moving object was following a path different from the majority of the candidates .",
    "the maximal distance for a candidate to be a neighbor of a point is called _ maxdist_. in this paper we define neighborhood inspired by the work of @xcite .",
    "the main difference is on the semantics of the neighbor .",
    "while in @xcite the neighbors are points that are close to the object being analyzed , we consider as neighbors the subtrajectories ( candidates ) that are close to a subtrajectory point .",
    "let @xmath6 be a point .",
    "the neighborhood of @xmath6 + @xmath30 is a candidate and @xmath31 .",
    "the distance between points @xmath6 and @xmath32 , defined as @xmath33 , is the euclidean distance between the points .",
    "figure  [ fig : vizinhanca ] shows an example of neighborhood.the neighborhood of point @xmath6 are the candidates @xmath34 and @xmath35 , since these two candidates have at least one point inside the radious of size _ maxdist _ around @xmath6 .",
    "notice that point @xmath32 has no candidates inside its radios of size _ maxdist _ , so its neighborhood is empty .",
    "we can conclude that at point @xmath6 , @xmath36 was moving with @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( same path ) , but at point @xmath32 , @xmath36 was moving far from @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( different path ) .        to find the path followed by the majority of the candidates , we use the minimum support concept ( _ minsup _ ) , which is the minimal amount of candidates that a point should have in its neighborhood to be part of a crowded or dense path . in the example in figure  [ fig : vizinhanca ] , if we consider _ minsup _ 2 , the point @xmath6 in candidate @xmath36 is in a dense path , while point @xmath32 in @xmath36 moves alone .",
    "the most crowded or dense path between two regions is in general the standard path that connects the regions .",
    "a candidate that has all its points in a crowded path is considered as the standard path between two regions .",
    "so all candidates that belong to the standard path are called standards .",
    "let @xmath37 be a candidate , @xmath38 is a standard candidate if and only if @xmath39 .",
    "normally there exists a more frequent path ( standard path ) to move from one region to another .",
    "going back to our example of figure  [ fig : exparis ] , we can see that there is a main path which connects eiffel tower and hotel des invalides , which is followed by the majority of the trajectories .",
    "this path is the standard .",
    "the candidates that have at least one point where cardinality of its neighborhood is less than _ minsup _ are called _",
    "potential outliers_. therefore , the candidates are split in standards and potencial outliers , so a candidate will always be either a standard or a potential outlier . when all candidates between two regions are potencial outliers , there is no standard . as a consequence",
    ", there is no standard path that an object could avoid or deviate . on the other side ,",
    "if there is at least one standard , then the potential outliers did really perform a deviation , and are classified as spatial outliers .",
    "let @xmath40 be the set of candidates between two regions .",
    "a potential outlier is a spatial outlier if @xmath41 is a standard .",
    "the first assumption to define a semantic outlier is that it should move between two regions of interest .",
    "the second assumption is that there must be a standard path that connects the regions such that the outlier should avoid or deviate it .",
    "therefore , any subtrajectory that uses a path different from the standard is a semantic spatial outlier .",
    "figure  [ fig : outlierespacial ] shows an example of semantic spatial outlier , considering @xmath42 .",
    "in this example there are 3 candidates ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) that move from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where , @xmath43 and @xmath45 are spatial outliers and @xmath44 is a standard .",
    "this is possible because the neighborhood of @xmath44 is never empty , having at least one candidate .",
    "notice that at @xmath46 , both @xmath43 and @xmath45 are in the neighborhood of @xmath44 ( the neighborhood is represented by the circle ) .",
    "at @xmath47 , @xmath43 is inside the neighborhood of @xmath44 , while @xmath45 is doing a deviation . at @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath43 is deviating , while @xmath45 is moving along @xmath44 .",
    "two candidates leave the same region at the same time window if the difference between the timestamps of the first point of the candidates is less than a given time tolerance .",
    "when two candidates leave the start region at the same time window we say that they are synchronized .",
    "let @xmath40 be the set of candidates between two regions .",
    "a spatial outlier @xmath49 is a spatio - temporal outlier if @xmath41 is standard and @xmath38 is synchronized with @xmath49 .    in this work",
    "we analyze the time that the objects leave the region , since the objective is to know if they have a syncronized departure , and it is not relevant if they keep the synchronization until reaching the destination .",
    "it is quite obvious that outliers which perform a different path will arrive at the destination at a different time than the standards . in this paper",
    "we are interested in other time properties of the outliers in relation to the standards , in order to add more semantics to both standards and outliers .",
    "we will compare their duration , the traveled distance , the day , month and period that the outlier occurred and if the outlier performed stops during its movement .",
    "based on this analysis , we go one step further to give more semantics to both spatial and spatio - temporal outliers .",
    "we classify the outliers in two types : _ semantic avoidance outlier _ and _ semantic stop outlier_. a semantic avoidance outlier is a outlier that has the intent to avoid the group in the standard path to faster reach the destination . therefore , its duration is lower than the average duration of the standards .    in the next two definitions ( definition  [ def : avoidanceout ] and definition  [ def : stopout ] ) we will consider that @xmath50 is a set of standards with the same initial and final regions of the outlier @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath49 is a spatio - temporal outlier , then @xmath50 contains only the synchronized standards , otherwise , if @xmath49 is a spatial outlier , then @xmath50 contains all the standards .",
    "we will also consider that @xmath51 is the average duration of the standards contained in @xmath50 .",
    "[ def : avoidanceout ] let @xmath49 be an outlier , @xmath49 is a semantic avoidance outlier if @xmath52 .",
    "a semantic stop outlier is a spatial outlier or spatio - temporal outlier that the duration is higher than the average duration of the standards and it made stops in its path .",
    "these stops could be either intentional or not , but this issue is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "so we can define a stop outlier as :    [ def : stopout ] let @xmath49 be an outlier , @xmath49 is a semantic stop outlier if @xmath53 and @xmath49 has a stop .    in this section",
    "we presented the basic concepts for semantic outliers , and in the follow section we will show the tra - sod algorithm to find this pattern .",
    "listing  [ list : algoritmo ] presents the pseudo - code of the algorithm tra - sod to compute semantic outliers .",
    "the input of the algorithm is a set of trajectories @xmath54 , a set of regions of interest @xmath55 , the maximal distance ( _ maxdist _ ) , the minimum support ( _ minsup _ ) and _ timetolerance_. the regions can be places of interest for the application or computed by algorithms as _ cb - smot _",

    "where _ startregion _ represents the start region and _ endregion _ the final region , the algorithm starts by computing the candidates that move from _ startregion _ to _ endregion _ ( line  [ line : forcandidato ] ) , with the function _ findcandidates_. this function checks for every trajectory if it intersects the pair of regions .",
    "once the candidates are computed , the algorithm searches for the standards with the function ( _ findstandard _ ) ( line  [ line : forpotential ] ) , considering the parameters _ maxdist _ and _ minsup_. if the set of standards is not empty ( line  [ line : testeconj ] ) , then it goes for finding the spatial outliers , since there is a standard path that connects both regions .",

    "we do interpret the time to make it easier to the user to rapidly identify the periods of the outliers .",
    "therefore , the algorithm extracts from the timestamp in which the standards and outliers live the start region , several information , including : the day of the week ( e.g. monday ) that the outlier occurred , the period of the day ( e.g. afternoon ) , and the month of the year ( e.g. november ) .",
    "such granularity refinement is useful to interpret the patterns .",
    "the next step is to check if the outlier is synchronized with any standard , i.e. , if there are standards that leave the start region at a similar time as the spatial outlier ( line  [ line : synchronized ] ) . in case there is a synchronized standard , then the spatial outlier becomes a spatio - temporal outlier .    to give more meaning to the outliers the algorithm verifies if the duration is greater than the average duration of the standards ( line  [ line : stop ] ) . when the outlier is spatio - temporal ,",
    "the average duration is compared only with the synchronized standards , in order to check if the faster path is the one followed by the outlier or by the standards .",

    "it is important to notice that the output of traod is the total number of outliers and the outliers presented over the set of trajectories .",
    "no further analysis is performed .",

    "the difference between the results of both methods can be explained as follows : ( i ) traod was not developed to discover patterns between regions , ( ii ) traod does not consider the movement in both ways between two regions , but between all trajectories in the dataset , ( iii ) no standard path between two regions is considered to find outliers , and ( iv ) traod generates outliers with a minimal length .",

    "for the 10 candidates between b and a , 5 are standards and 5 are outliers , i.e. , 5 use a standard path while other 5 trajectories choose alternative routes , as can be seen by figure  [ fig : exams1 ] . in figure  [ fig : exams1](b ) we can notice that the outliers follow a sparse path in horizontal directions in relation to the standards ( figure  [ fig : exams1](a ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : exams2 ] shows a case between regions a and b where there is only one standard ( figure  [ fig : exams2](a ) ) , but 5 outliers ( figure  [ fig : exams2](b ) ) .",

    "this is a case similar to the one shown in figure  [ fig : outlierespacial ] .",
    "although with @xmath63 there is only one trajectory in the standards , this happens because all neighbors become outliers , having deviated the main route at some time during their movements .",
    "this is understandable because every outlier follows a different route at a moment .",

    "we can notice that most outliers found for minimal support 6 were also found with support 4 , what shows that basically the _ minsup _ affects the discovery of the standard path , and not the outliers .",
    "only 3 outliers ( o24 , o31 and o37 ) were not found in case 1 .    among the outliers in table  [",
    "table : tabelafinalams2 ] , five were on thursday night and six on friday morning and night . among the outliers on thursday ( o24 , o28 , o29 , o30 and o51 ) , their path was longer than the path followed by the standards and the duration was similar , except for outlier o30 that had a duration of 1:26 hours , while the duration of the standards was 9:50 minutes .",
    "all outliers on friday are spatial only , since there is no synchronized standard moving at similar time .",
    "seven of the 11 outliers ( o28 , o31 , o33 , o35 , o37 , o44 and o51 ) are classified as avoidance outliers , since they moved faster than the standards . among the slower outliers non of them have made stops , what means that they selected a worse path to follow in terms of speed of movement .",
    "several experiments were performed with traod and the closest result to tra - sod is shown in figure  [ fig : traodams ] . as the experiments with traod were done with the algorithm of the authors ( downloaded from @xcite ) , we did not edit the resulted image to add the regions to the figure , since traod does not consider regions .",
    "traod transforms subtrajectories in lines , what makes the result a bit different from tra - sod .",
    "traod found a total of 36 outliers among the candidates , while tra - sod found 28 and 14 .",
    "traod does not look for a standard path to find outliers , and does not do any further analysis , therefore it is impossible to infer the direction of the outliers found by traod , if they are going or returning , and if they are synchronized or happened at a similar period , since time is not considered .          as in any data mining algorithm",
    ", the parameter definition is a concern , and they directly affect the result of the algorithm .",
    "tra - sod makes use of three parameters only : _ maxdist _ ; _ minsup _ ; _ timetolerance_. _ maxdist _ is used to check if trajectories use the same path to find the standard route between two regions .",
    "the best value for this parameter is the width of the path used by the trajectories . in",
    "case objects are moving on road networks , _ maxdist _ should be as large as the street , such that only trajectories on the same street will be grouped in the same path . in applications where objects do freely move as birds in the sky or animals in the woods or even pedestrians in a park , _ maxdist _ may vary and can be set according to what the user defines as the width of a path .",
    "a to small _ maxdist _ may split objects that move in the same path , making it more difficult to find the standards .",
    "a very high _ maxdist _ may join objects that move in different paths ( distant paths ) in the same group .",
    "therefore , this parameter depends on the application .",
    "table  [ table : tabelaanalise1 ] presents an analysis of the parameters for the amsterdam dataset , for @xmath63 , @xmath65 minutes and varying _",
    "maxdist_. three different values were considered for _ maxdist _ : 20 , 50 e 80 metros .",
    "the first two columns are the start and end region .",
    "only paths which had standards are shown in the table .",
    "the number of candidates has not changed , since it does not depend on minimum distance . as can be noticed , the smaller the _ maxdist _ , the more difficult to find the standard path , since trajectories must be closer to be considered as moving in the same path .",
    "therefore , when @xmath66 , only two paths ( from b to a and b to d ) have at least on standard , while five paths have at least one standard for @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by looking only at the paths which have standards",
    "we may notice that the higher _ maxdist _ , the more candidates follow the same path , increasing the number of standards and reducing the outliers . so the smaller the minimal distance , the lower the number of standards and more outliers will be found , and vice - versa .",
    "table  [ table : tabelaanalise2 ] presents the results for @xmath67 meters , @xmath65 minutes and varying _",
    "minsup_. we considered _ minsup _ : 2 , 4 and 6 .",
    "table  [ table : tabelaanalise2 ] shows that for a low _ minsup _ ( 2 ) more candidates ( a to b , b to a , b to c , b to d and d to b ) generate a standard path , in total 44 standards . increasing _ minsup _ ( 6 ) , decreases the number of standards ( b to a and b to d ) to 19 .",
    "the lower the _ minsup _ the higher the number of standards and less outliers .",
    "the higher the _ minsup _ the lower the number of standards and more outliers . in the last case",
    ", the number of standards may reduce to zero , what means that no standard path was found . as a consequence ,",
    "no outliers are generated ( see rows 1 , 3 , 5 and 6 in table  [ table : tabelaanalise2 ] ) .",
    "the _ timetolerance _ influences the amount of spatio - temporal outliers .",
    "the higher the _ timetolerance _ the higher is the chance for several trajectories being traveling within the time window .",
    "however , a very high _ timetolerance _ may be meaning less in the sense that trajectories should be moving together .",
    "existing approaches for trajectory outliers mainly consider the space dimension , and time has not been the focus .",
    "they do not make deeper analysis of the discovered patterns to give more meaning or semantics .",
    "indeed , existing trajectory outlier algorithms search for detours in the whole dataset . in this paper",
    "we look for outliers among trajectories that have similar goals , i.e. , trajectories that move between the same regions .",
    "we present de definition of semantic outlier and an algorithm to find such patterns from trajectories , considering both spatial and spatio - temporal information .",
    "semantic outliers are those trajectories that move between regions of interest and that follow a path different from the standard route that connects the regions .",
    "the proposed algorithm , named tra - sod , finds both the standard path which connects the regions and the outliers .    for all outliers",
    "the proposed method evaluates the duration , the traveled distance , the time of the outliers in relation to the standard path , and if outliers made stops , giving more semantics to both spatial and spatio - temporal outliers . with such information",
    "we classify the patterns in avoidance outliers and stop outliers .    in this paper",
    "we first look for spatial outliers and in a second step verify if they are synchronous in time , i.e. , if they leave the region of interest at the same time window as the standards .",
    "we do so because only if patterns are spatial they may be temporal or not . by looking only to spatio - temporal outliers several patterns that occur in space but do not hold for similar time period",
    "would be missed .",
    "we compared the proposed method tra - sod with the algorithm traod to show that the results are different , since both methods have been developed for different goals .",
    "although tra - sod looks for patterns among trajectories which travel between the same regions instead of the whole dataset , the running time of tra - sod is higher than traod , since it has to find the candidates and to interpret the outliers .",
    "future ongoing work includes a deep analysis on the standards and the use of clustering techniques to group trajectories that are in the same path .",
    "in addition , we will define more types of outliers and perform more experiments on generated data , where the outliers are previously known .",
    "we will also do further analysis on the interpretation of the outliers , giving weights for avoidance outliers and stop outliers .",
