    "the existence of vortex fluctuations close to the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath9 , in the high temperate superconductors was reported by kes and coworkers,@xcite and theoretical work by bulaevskii and coworkers@xcite indicated that entropy terms associated with moving vortices could provide a way to understand the unique crossing - point in the magnetization vs. temperature plots that are observed .",

    "subsequent experimental and theoretical work by tesanovic and coworkers@xciteand welp and coworkers@xcite indicated that the similar crossing - point effects also occur in materials with smaller @xmath11-values , but the fluctuations may have @xmath8 character . in the case of @xmath7 fluctuations ,",

    "these scaling laws provide an easy test to determine whether the fluctuations have a @xmath7 or @xmath8 character .",
    "a recent study of vortex fluctuations in an underdoped @xmath15 sample by poddar and coworkers@xcitehas indicated that there were two distinct crossing points for different magnetic field ranges .",

    "the purpose to the work reported here is to systematically study the change in fluctuations that occur as the doping level is decreased in @xmath32 to look for a systematic transformtion from @xmath8 to @xmath7 character and to look for the values of reduced magnetic field , @xmath33 where this cross - over occurs .",
    "the samples used in this work are the same grain - aligned powders and single crystals that were used for measurments of the thermodynamic critical field.@xcite powders were ground to a particle size less than @xmath34 , placed in a low viscosity epoxy and aligned in a field of @xmath35 .",
    "after the epoxy hardened , x - ray rocking curves showed a full width at half maximum for the ( 008 ) peak of @xmath36 .",

    "as reported earlier,@xcite the magnetization vs temperature curves for the @xmath1 single crystal with @xmath38 showed a single crossing point at @xmath39 and @xmath40 for all data from @xmath41 .",

    "fits of these data on a @xmath12 vs. @xmath13/(th)^{1/2}$ ] plot show @xmath7 scaling over this entire field range . to discuss the case",
    "where the crossings occur at different temperatures , we define a new variable @xmath42 as the temperature where two successive @xmath28 curves cross and plot @xmath42 as a function of magnetic field to show how the crossing point changes with field .",

    "the data from @xmath44 to @xmath45 cross at about @xmath46 and the data from @xmath47 to @xmath2 cross at about @xmath48 , in a manner similar to the @xmath31 data reported by poddar.@xcite these temperatures are fairly close to one another , but they are easily resolved . if data for these two samples are fit to both @xmath7 and @xmath8 scaling , the @xmath8 scaling gives a significantly better fit than the @xmath7 scaling for both plateaus .",
    "the data on fig . 2 for the two samples close to optimum doping , @xmath49 ( open stars ) and @xmath43 , ( solid pentagons ) are very similar .",
    "within the theory of rosenstein et al.@xcite the relevant quantity to determine the scaling dimensionality is @xmath50 .",
    "for these samples close to optimum doping , the upper critical field , @xmath27 , is approximately @xmath51 , so the measurments up to @xmath2 never probe the region close to @xmath27 so the @xmath50 is small . .",

    ", @xmath52 is much higher than the measuring field of @xmath2 , so the data never approach the upper critical field .",
    "the difference between the @xmath43 sample and the @xmath1 sample is that the optimum doped sample obeys @xmath8 scaling and the underdoped sample obeys @xmath7 scaling .",
    "this would imply that the c - axis coherence distance to copper oxide plane spacing , @xmath23 , is always less than one for the magnetic fields measured .",
    "data for an @xmath53 sample are shown by the solid diamonds on fig.2 .",
    "the @xmath42 data are similar to the @xmath1 sample and show @xmath7 behavior over the range measured . for this sample , @xmath54 , so the measurements up to @xmath2 do not probe anywhere close to @xmath27 .    in the far underdoped region ,",
    "data for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 samples differ from the above cases in that the respective upper critical fields of @xmath57 and @xmath58 are much closer to the top measuring field of @xmath2 .",

    "4 shows that the @xmath55 sample ( open squares ) has a plateau from about @xmath62 to @xmath63 , and it has a second plateau from about @xmath64 to @xmath2 with a gradual transition from @xmath65 . here ,",
    "data on the low field plateau fit best to @xmath7 scaling , and data on the high field plateau fit best to @xmath8 scaling as shown in fig . 5a and fig .",
    "5b . in a similar manner , data for the @xmath56 sample ( solid circles in fig .",
    "4 ) shows both a low field plateau at @xmath66 and a high field plateau at @xmath67 . here again , the low field plateau data fit @xmath7 scaling and the high field plateau data fit @xmath8 scaling as shown by fig . 5c and fig .",
    "both these samples show that with an increasing magnetic field , the sample undergoes a cross - over from @xmath7 scaling to @xmath8 scaling as @xmath4 is approached .",

    "the c - axis coupling is strong enough in the optimally doped samples to make the fluctations @xmath8 at all the measured fields .",
    "stated another way , @xmath23 is greater than one for these samples .",
    "as discussed previously@xcite a reduction of carrier concentration tends to make the material more @xmath7 at magnetic fields substantially below @xmath27 , presumably because the relatively weak c - axis coupling in these cuprates is made even weaker with depleted carrier concentration .",
    "reduction of the doping to @xmath53 and @xmath1 gave samples that showed @xmath7 fluctuations for all magnetic fields up to @xmath2 .",
    "presumably the @xmath74 did not get large enough for fields up to @xmath2 in these two samples to cause a @xmath7 to @xmath8 transition .",
    "for all four of these samples , @xmath27 was over @xmath79 so the @xmath50 values are small compared to the reduced temperature , @xmath80 terms and thus the @xmath81 term in eq .",
    "( 1 ) does not make a large enough contribution to cause the cross - over . with further reduction in doping to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the data probes fields comparable to @xmath27 .",

    "the authors do not understand this difference , but in light of eq .",
