    "# 1.3ex    up to now , supersymmetry has been a theorist s dream and an experimentalist s nightmare . on the one hand , theorists tend to like supersymmetry because it provides a beautiful mathematical structure which can be used to stabilize the mass hierarchy against radiative corrections . on the other hand",
    ", many experimentalists despise the subject because supersymmetric predictions always seem to lie just out of reach .    at present , direct searches for supersymmetry",
    "are just shots in the dark because current accelerators do not have the power to explore significant regions of the parameter space .",
    "as we will see , this will soon change , but for now , direct searches do not restrict the theory in any important way .",
    "precision electroweak measurements also reveal very little about supersymmetry .",
    "the technical reason for this is that supersymmetry decouples from all standard - model electroweak observables .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric and standard - model values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are related as follows @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mass of the @xmath4 , and @xmath5 denotes the scale of the supersymmetric spectrum .",
    "theorists can simply raise @xmath5 and bring supersymmetry into complete accord with standard - model predictions .",
    "fortunately , the next generation of accelerators , including the fermilab main injector , lep 200 , and a possible higher - luminosity tevatron , will open a new era in supersymmetric particle searches .",
    "these accelerators will  for the first time ",
    "begin to probe significant regions of the supersymmetric parameter space . and with the advent of the lhc , the search for supersymmetry will finally cover most  if not all  of the parameter space that is relevant for weak - scale supersymmetry .    in this talk we will examine the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "we will impose supersymmetric unification and show the preferred range for the supersymmetric particle masses .",
    "we will also discuss two more specialized points : the constraints on the supersymmetric spectrum that follow from supersymmetric unification , as well as the one - loop constraints on the mass of the lightest higgs boson .",
    "supersymmetry stabilizes the hierarchy @xmath6 against quadratically - divergent radiative corrections . however , it does so at a tremendous cost : a doubling of the particle spectrum . in supersymmetric theories ,",
    "all bosons are paired with fermions and vice versa . for the case at hand , each of the standard - model particles is accompanied by a supersymmetric partner with the same su(3 ) @xmath7 su(2 ) @xmath7 u(1 ) quantum numbers .",
    "if supersymmetry is not broken , these superparticles are degenerate in mass with their original standard - model partners .",
    "[ figlabel ]    the fact that such particles have not been observed tells us that supersymmetry must be broken  and that the breaking must be soft . in other words , the supersymmetry breaking must not reintroduce destabilizing quadratic divergences .",
    "the various types of soft supersymmetry breaking have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "one finds over 50 new parameters :    * 3 gaugino masses : @xmath8 * 23 scalar masses : @xmath9 * 27 trilinear scalar couplings : @xmath10 * 1 bilinear scalar coupling : @xmath11 .",
    "( plus phases ) .",
    "naturalness requires that each of the dimensionful couplings be less than about a tev , but that is all we know .",
    "the most general softly - broken supersymmetric theory has an enormous parameter space  and theorists are prepared to use every bit of it to evade experimental limits !",
    "[ figlabel ]    motivated by the successful unification of the gauge couplings in the supersymmetric standard model ( fig .  1 ) , it is not unreasonable to assume that the soft breakings unify as well . in this case",
    "the parameter space reduces substantially , to include    * 1 universal gaugino mass : @xmath12 * 1 universal scalar mass : @xmath13 * 1 universal trilinear scalar coupling : @xmath14 * 1 bilinear scalar coupling : @xmath11 .    as usual in a unified theory , these parameters are fixed at the unification scale @xmath15 .",
    "their values in the low - energy theory are determined by the renormalization group , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "at the unification scale , the unification assumption forbids electroweak symmetry breaking because all scalar masses  including that of the higgs  have the common value @xmath13 .",
    "however , top - quark loops decrease the higgs mass . therefore , in the renormalization group evolution , they drive down the mass of the higgs .",
    "if the top yukawa coupling is sufficiently large ( corresponding to a top mass of about 150  200 gev ) , the mass squared goes negative and triggers electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is remarkable that this radiative mechanism for symmetry breaking @xcite , first proposed in 1983 , is based on a top - quark mass that is in complete agreement with current experiments !    in what follows , we present expectations for the supersymmetric spectrum based on this unification scenario . for simplicity , we set @xmath16 , and we trade @xmath17 for the value of @xmath18 , evaluated at the scale @xmath19 . in our figures",
    "we take @xmath20 , @xmath21 gev , and the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we find the values of various supersymmetric masses as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath12 , for two values of @xmath24 .",
    "( in the figures , all masses are one - loop pole masses . )",
    "[ figlabel ]    in fig .",
    "3 we show mass contours for the lightest superparticle , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath25 is neutral , and because of a global symmetry called @xmath26-parity , is assumed to be stable . in the figure , the shaded areas represent forbidden regions of parameter space , either because of present experimental limits or because of theoretical constraints such as the cosmological requirement that the lightest ( stable ) superparticle be neutral , or the phenomenological constraint that electroweak symmetry be broken , but not color .",
    "[ figlabel ]    in fig .",
    "4 we show contours for the ( up ) squark and the gluino masses .",
    "( the masses of the up , down , charm and strange squarks are almost degenerate . ) from the plot we see that our parameter space covers squark masses up to about 1 tev .",
    "this is the range of interest if supersymmetry is to stabilize the weak - scale hierarchy .",
    "( the rule of thumb is that @xmath27 and @xmath28 . )",
    "[ figlabel ]    in fig .",
    "5 we plot contours for the masses of the lightest higgs scalar , @xmath29 , and the lightest chargino , @xmath30 .",
    "we see that @xmath31 , and that for our parameter space , the maximum higgs mass is about 120 gev .",
    "( for completeness , we note that the slepton masses are approximately @xmath32 . )    [ figlabel ]    finally , in fig .",
    "6 we show contours for the lightest stop squark , @xmath33 , and charged higgs , @xmath34 . from the figure",
    "we see that the decays @xmath35 and @xmath36 are kinematically forbidden over most of the parameter space .",
    "( the stop can be lighter for @xmath37 , but a very light stop requires a fine tuning of the parameters . )",
    "these figures can be used to illustrate the supersymmetry reach of a given accelerator .",
    "for example , lep 200 has a mass reach of about @xmath38 gev for a supersymmetric higgs particle , and @xmath39 for a chargino .",
    "therefore fig .",
    "5 shows that lep 200 has an excellent chance of discovering the lightest supersymmetric higgs and a reasonable possibility of finding the lightest chargino .",
    "[ figlabel ]    the tevatron s discovery potential is more model - dependent , and varies considerably with the tevatron luminosity . for an integrated luminosity between 200 pb@xmath40 and 25 fb@xmath40 ,",
    "the gluino discovery reach is in the range of 300  400 gev .",
    "likewise , the chargino / neutralino reach varies between 150  250 gev in the trilepton decay channel , @xmath41 plus missing energy @xcite . from figs .  4 and 5 we see that an upgraded tevatron would begin to cover a significant amount of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "in the introduction , we argued that precision electroweak measurements can not be used to restrict the allowed regions of @xmath23 and @xmath12 because supersymmetric effects decouple from electroweak observables .",
    "this can be seen explicitly in fig .  7 , where we plot the one - loop @xmath4-boson pole mass against @xmath12 , for two values of @xmath23 .",
    "we see that the supersymmetric @xmath4 mass is indistinguishable from the standard - model mass for @xmath42 gev .",
    "the figure also shows that a measurement uncertainty for @xmath3 of 40 mev gives a sensitivity to the region @xmath43 gev for @xmath44 gev .",
    "but this is just the region that will be probed directly by lep 200 and by the tevatron with the main injector !    in the context of supersymmetric unification , however , precision measurements can play an important role in restricting the supersymmetric parameter space . to see this",
    ", we recall that in a unified model , @xmath45 can be predicted as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the weak- and unification - scale thresholds . for the case at hand , we determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the electroweak observables @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath19 . we then calculate the weak - scale thresholds using the minimal supersymmetric standard model , and take the unification - scale thresholds to be those of a particular unified model . in this way we can compute @xmath50 as a function of the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath12 in any unified model .",
    "[ figlabel ]    in fig .",
    "8 we show the prediction for @xmath50 in the absence of unification - scale thresholds .",
    "we see that @xmath50 is generally much larger than the experimental value of @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , we see that @xmath52 requires @xmath53 tev or @xmath54 gev @xcite .",
    "[ figlabel ]    in fig .",
    "9 we show the effects of unification - scale thresholds .",
    "we parametrize these thresholds by @xmath55 , and illustrate the allowed values in the minimal and missing - doublet su(5 ) models , together with the threshold required to give @xmath56 . from the figure",
    "we see that minimal su(5 ) requires @xmath53 tev , which leads to squark masses of more than 1 tev .",
    "weak - scale radiative corrections are also important in determining the higgs mass . as is well - known , in supersymmetric models the tree - level higgs mass is determined by gauge couplings , and is bounded from above by @xmath19 . for heavy top , this value receives significant radiative corrections , and for @xmath57 gev , the bound increases to about 120 gev .",
    "experimentally , this is a very interesting number because it is almost within reach of lep 200 .",
    "theoretically , @xmath58 gev is interesting as well , because it is approximately the _ lower _ bound for the higgs mass in the ordinary , nonsupersymmetric standard model . in the standard model , top - quark loops give a negative logarithmically - divergent @xmath59 contribution to the effective potential , and this contribution can destabilize the vacuum . if we require that the standard model hold all the way to the planck scale , so that the cutoff @xmath60 , then the higgs mass must be more than about 120 gev @xcite .",
    "[ figlabel ]    this is illustrated in fig .",
    "10 , where we plot the allowed higgs masses as a function of @xmath61 . from the figure we see that the maximum mass increases with @xmath61 in supersymmetric standard model , as does the minimum mass in the ordinary standard model .",
    "the curves have different slopes , and cross at @xmath57 gev .",
    "these curves indicate that if the higgs is discovered at lep 200 , either supersymmetry is right , or that there must be other new physics below the planck scale !",
    "in this talk we have seen that supersymmetry searches are about to enter an important new era . with lep 200 and the main injector",
    ", they will begin to probe large regions of the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "with luck , supersymmetry might even be found before the advent of the lhc !",
