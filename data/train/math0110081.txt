    "bernard ( qkzb ) equations on elliptic curves and their solutions initiated in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "hypergeometric solutions of qkzb equations were introduced . in @xcite ,",
    "the monodromy of hypergeometric solutions was calculated , and a symmetry between equations and monodromies was discovered : the equations giving the monodromy are again qkzb equations but with modular parameter and step of the difference equations exchanged .",
    "in @xcite we introduced the @xmath0-analogue of the kzb heat equation , which governs the change in the modular parameter of the elliptic curve , proved that it is compatible with the other equations and explained how to recover the kzb heat equation in the semiclassical limit .    in this paper",
    "we prove three results about our hypergeometric solutions in the case where the sum of highest weights is two : we show that the hypergeometric solutions also obeys the qkzb heat equation of @xcite , see theorem [ t - he1 ] .",
    "we give a formula ( theorem [ t - mod ] ) for the transformation properties of the hypergeometric solutions under the modular group @xmath4 .",
    "we prove a completeness result , corollary [ completeness ] , by showing that the associated `` fourier transform '' is invertible .",
    "then we show that these results are part of a bigger picture , in which the modular group combines with the transformation defined by the qkzb heat equation to give a set of quadratic identities for our generalized hypergeometric integrals .",
    "in fact , this picture can already be seen in a simpler situation , in which the elliptic gamma function @xcite , @xcite plays the role of the hypergeometric integral .",
    "the elliptic gamma function is a function @xmath5 of three complex variables obeying identities @xcite involving its values at points related by an action of @xmath6 .",
    "these identities mean that @xmath7 is a `` degree 1 '' generalization of a jacobi modular function , see @xcite .",
    "these identities are a scalar version of the identities obeyed by the hypergeometric solutions of the qkzb equation .",
    "their meaning is that the hypergeometric integrals define a discrete projectively flat @xmath1-connection ( i.e. , a lift of the action to the projectivization ) on a vector bundle over `` regular '' orbits of @xmath1 acting on the variety of pairs ( point in @xmath8 , plane through @xmath9 containing it ) .",
    "this is the content of theorem [ t - pf ] .",
    "the results on the elliptic gamma function are used in the proof , since the `` phase function '' which appears in the integrand of hypergeometric solutions is a ratio of gamma functions .",
    "in fact , we see `` experimentally '' that there seems to be a principle stating that to every identity obeyed by the gamma function , there corresponds an identity for hypergeometric integrals .",
    "the proofs of the identities consist in applying the gamma function identity to the phase function in the integrand , and then use a version of stokes theorem to relate the integrals .",
    "the second step is relatively simple in the case of the one - dimensional integrals to which we restrict ourselves here , but becomes exceedingly involved in the higher dimensional case .",
    "proving our identities in the higher dimensional case , i.e. , if the sum of highest weights is larger than two , remains a challenging open problem .",
    "an alternative approach to this problem is based on representation theory : in @xcite a representation - theoretic interpretation of a degenerate version of the qkzb equations was established .",
    "it was shown that traces of intertwining operators for quantum groups satisfy a version of the qkzb equations and are eigenfunctions of analogues of macdonald operators .",
    "this fact indicates that our theorem [ t - he1 ] is an elliptic analogue of the macdonald - mehta identities proved by cherednik , @xcite , @xcite , and the present work is a glimpse into an elliptic version of macdonald s theory .",
    "in fact theorem [ t - pf ] concerns the case of generic parameters , where an infinite - dimensional vector bundle is preserved by the projectively flat connection . in a next paper",
    "we will restrict our attention to special @xmath1-orbits .",
    "the projectively flat connection can be then defined on a finite - dimensional vector bundle of theta - functions which are a @xmath0-deformed version of the space of conformal blocks in conformal field theory . in this",
    "setting the analogy with macdonald s theory will appear more explicitly .",
    "another degeneration of the @xmath1 symmetry of our hypergeometric integrals are the @xmath1 symmetries of the ordinary fourier transform indicated in @xcite .",
