    "the 2014 fifa world cup championship in brazil expected to attract the attention of more than 3 billion people worldwide is the quadrennial soccer tournament since 1930 . whereas , the most popular design for the fifa soccer ball , the telstar , which was used in the official logo for the 1970 world cup , consists of twelve black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels , a truncated icosahedron belonging icosahedral point group@xcite .",
    "since then , a number of different designs have appeared , some with small variations such as the fevernova ( 2002 ) and the teamgeist ( 2006 ) which still have icosahedral symmetry but with low - symmetry tetrahedral patterns painted on the ball ; some balls only show lower polyhedral patterns such as jabulani ( 2012 ) with tetrahedral symmetry without icosahedral symmetry superimposed .",
    "however , the soccer ball , `` brazuca '' ball , used for the world cup this summer in brazil has a new design based on octahedral symmetry . basically , the `` brazuca '' ball is composed of six bonded polyerethane panels with four - arm clover - shaped panels that interlock like a jigsaw puzzle smoothly on a sphere@xcite .    in 1985 , it was discovered that , in addition to diamond and graphite , carbon atoms can have a third new allotrope consisting of 60-atom spherical molecules , @xmath2 , sometimes nicknamed molecular soccer ball because the shape of this molecule is identical to the standard soccer ball , with @xmath3 atoms located at @xmath3 identical vertices@xcite .",
    "more generally , this molecule belongs to a family of sp@xmath4-hybridized pure carbon systems now called fullerenes that contain only five- and six - membered rings .",
    "since then , structures of fullerenes have been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically . under this constraint , considerable effort has been devoted to detailed enumerations of possible structures .",
    "for instance , a complete list of fullerenes with less than or equal to 60 carbon atoms and all fullerenes less than and equal to @xmath5 carbon atoms that satisfy the isolated pentagon rule ( ipr ) is tabulated in the monograph by fowler and manolopolous@xcite .",
    "among all these fullerenes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the possible symmetry point groups for fullerenes are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 can be @xmath24 or @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "however , only two out of three platonic polyhedral groups , namely tetrahedral and icosahedral groups , seems to be possible for fullerenes .",
    "so the question is , can we have fullerenes with octahedral symmetry just like the `` brazuca '' ball ? if possible , what are the general construction and classification rules for this family of octahedral fullerenes ?    to answer this question , we start with the construction process of fullerenes with polyhedral symmetries through a simple cut - and - patch procedure as shown in figure  [ fig : goldberg ] . for instance , constructing a fullerene with icosahedral symmetry can be done by cutting 20 equivalent equilateral triangles from graphene and pasting them onto the triangular faces of an icosahedron .",
    "this will create twelve pentagons sitting at twelve vertices of the icosahedron@xcite .",
    "similar cut - and - patch procedure can be used to construct fullerenes with tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries , too ( figure  [ fig : goldberg ] ) .",
    "however , the non - hexagons such as triangles and squares will appear at the vertices of the template tetrahedron and octahedron , which are in contradiction to the definition of fullerenes . in the case of tetrahedral fullerenes",
    ", we can replace the template tetrahedron with a truncated tetrahedron .",
    "this makes it possible to the construction of tetrahedral fullerenes without triangles by a suitable cut - and - patch construction scheme@xcite . but",
    "this technique is not applicable to octahedral fullerenes@xcite .",
    "( also known as goldberg vector ) from graphene and then patch the triangle onto different platonic solids to construct fullerenes with different polyhedral symmetries .",
    "the famous @xmath2 , can be also constructed in this way using icosahedron as the template with goldberg vector ( 1,1 ) .",
    "[ fig : goldberg],width=453 ]    albeit the appearance of squares in these caged octahedral fullerenes leads to energetically unstable molecules , one can still find in literatures that some studies have been carried out on the geometric , topological@xcite , and electronic structures@xcite of fullerenes with octahedral symmetry by introducing squares on a template octahedron ( figure  [ fig : goldberg ] ) .",
    "in addition to the pure carbon allotropes , the octahedral boron - nitride systems have also been vigorously investigated@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a general cut - and - patch construction and classification scheme for fullerenes with octahedral symmetry by systematically introducing some other non - hexagons such as octagons with a cantellated cube as the template .",
    "the octahedral fullerenes previously considered in literatures are included as limiting cases in our general construction scheme@xcite .",
    "we also like to point out that the cut - and - patch method is a simple and powerful method for building various kinds of fullerenes and graphitic structures .",
    "for instance , we have applied this method successfully to many other template polyhedral tori and concluded general structural rules of carbon nanotori@xcite .",
    "from there , structural relations for a whole family of topologically nontrivial fullerenes and graphitic structures such as carbon nanohelices , high - genus fullerenes , carbon schwarzites and so on can be derived@xcite .",
    "we start by briefly describing the icosahedral fullerenes that consist only of hexagons and pentagons .",
    "the simplest icosahedral fullerene that satisfies ipr is @xmath2 , which can also be viewed as a truncated icosahedron , one of the thirteen archimedean solids if we ignore the slight variation in bond lengths . in a truncated icosahedron",
    ", there are exactly twelve pentagons and twenty hexagons .",
    "this structure can be derived from a regular icosahedron by truncating the twelve vertices away appropriately .",
    "we will show that this is the only possibility if we want to construct an icosahedral fullerene with pentagons and hexagons only .    using the euler s polyhedron formula , @xmath29 for a polyhedron with @xmath30 vertices , @xmath31 edges and @xmath32 faces , and the condition @xmath33 for trivalent carbon atoms in a fullerene",
    ", we can find easily the condition @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of @xmath26-gons .",
    "if we assign each face a topological charge @xmath36 , the euler s polyhedron formula states that the sum of topological charges of a trivalent polyhedron must be twelve . therefore , fullerenes that contain only pentagons and hexagons must have twelve pentagons , i.e. @xmath37 , while there is no constraint on the number of hexagons , @xmath38 , except the case with only one hexagon , @xmath39 , is forbidden .",
    "this conclusion is general and can be applied to any fullerene regardless of its symmetry .",
    "an arbitrary icosahedral fullerene can be classified by its chiral vector @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy the inequality @xmath43 , according to the goldberg construction @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xmath2 corresponds to the fullerene with chiral vector @xmath44 .",
    "interestingly , these twelve pentagons are located at the high - symmetry points along the six fivefold rotational axes of the icosahedral symmetry group .",
    "suppose that these pentagons are not located at the high symmetry points , there should be five pentagons around each of these points in order to satisfy the symmetry requirement",
    ". therefore , there must be @xmath45 pentagons in total .",
    "however , the condition , @xmath46 , will require some @xmath26-gons where @xmath47 to compensate the extra topological charges introduced by these pentagons .",
    "so , we conclude that exactly twelve pentagons must be located at the high symmetry points along the six fivefold rotation axes .",
    "we apply the above analysis to the requirement for octahedral fullerenes .",
    "first , there are three fourfold axes , four threefold axes , and six twofold axes in the octahedral group .",
    "pentagons are not compatible with any of the high symmetry points of octahedral groups .",
    "therefore , there is no high symmetry point where pentagons can be located .",
    "the best we can do is to put clusters of pentagons around , for example , the three fourfold axes .",
    "then we need to put twenty - four pentagons together with @xmath26-gons where @xmath47 to balance the topological charges .",
    "a simple way is to put six octagons at the six high symmetry points along three fourfold axes , so that the condition , @xmath34 , is satisfied .",
    "the twofold or the fourfold axes can also be chosen@xcite , but the resulting fullerenes are considerably more energetically unfavored because additional non - hexagons need to be introduced .",
    "to illustrate this idea , we present a simple construction procedure using the cut - and - patch scheme as shown in figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme ] .",
    "we first cut the polygonal region as defined by the solid thick line from graphene ( figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](a ) ) and then patch twenty - four replica of it on a cantellated cube as shown in figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](b ) .",
    "the points , @xmath0 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](a ) overlap with vertices of the cantellated cube while @xmath50 and @xmath51 the centers of the triangle and the square faces , respectively . in this process , every four identical isosceles triangles , @xmath52 , cover one square face ( figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](b ) ) . since the angular deficit at @xmath53 is @xmath54 , it must correspond to the location of an octagon . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular deficit at @xmath0 is @xmath55",
    ". therefore a pentagon will be generated at @xmath0 by this cut - and - patch process .    , @xmath56 and @xmath53 , represent the high symmetry points of the octahedral symmetry respectively .",
    "@xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is one - third of a regular triangle ( the dotted triangle in ( a ) ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath56 ) is the corresponding triangle center on graphene .",
    "points @xmath0 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 become positions where twenty - four equivalent pentagons are located at , while point @xmath53 becomes the position for one of six equivalent octagons after they are patched onto the cantellated cube .",
    "the two base vectors , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , can in general be any two vectors such that @xmath53 does not coincide with an atom ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath61 ) .",
    "@xmath62 in this example .",
    "( c ) the 3d geometry of an octahedral fullerene specified according to its topological coordinates @xcite .",
    "[ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme],width=566 ]    we will define the area inside the solid thick line as shown in figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](a ) as the fundamental polygon .",
    "note that the two base vectors , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in the fundamental polygon become the edges of the square and the regular triangle on the cantellated cube , respectively , as shown in figure  [ fig : of_cut_patch_scheme](b ) . for convenience ,",
    "we refer to @xmath65 as the square base vector and @xmath66 the triangular base vector from now on . using these two vectors",
    ", we can uniquely specify a scalene triangle with four integers @xmath67 , which we will simply call the indices of octahedral fullerenes later . in additional to this scalene triangle , we also need to incorporate two extra triangles , @xmath52 and @xmath58 , corresponding to one - third of the regular triangles which share the same edges with the scalene triangle .",
    "the numbers of carbon atoms inside @xmath52 , @xmath52 , and @xmath68 are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively . after patching twenty - four fundamental polygons onto a cantellated cube , we get an octahedral fullerene with @xmath72 carbon atoms .",
    "the octahedral fullerenes can be catagorized into two groups according to the sign of the angle @xmath73 formed by @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "octahedral fullerenes with @xmath76 are in category @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and octahedral fullerenes @xmath79 are in category @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "this criterion is equivalent to determining the sign of @xmath82 , which stands for the signed area enclosed by the parallelogram spanned by the two base vectors up to a positive factor .",
    "here we can take one step further to include the degenerate cases , _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath68 degenerates into a line , which can be considered as limiting cases when @xmath73 approaches to the boundaries of its range in each category .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that in general @xmath83 is inequivalent to @xmath84 and @xmath85 is inequivalent to @xmath86 , as shown in figure  [ fig : degenerate ] . on the other hand , the category letter in the subscript",
    "can be omitted when there is no ambiguity .",
    "we will elaborate in later sections .    ,",
    "( b ) @xmath87 , ( c ) @xmath88 and ( d ) @xmath89 .",
    "we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "however , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath94 transformation will be discussed in later sections . [",
    "fig : degenerate],width=566 ]    following the above cut - and - patch scheme , we can define a scalene triangle and thus the fundamental polygon , given the two base vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 that satisfy the condition , @xmath61 .",
    "each of these fundamental polygons uniquely defines an octahedral fullerene in non - degenerate case .",
    "when the two base vectors are parallel to each other , it is necessary to further specify the category explicitly .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that if the condition @xmath61 is not satisfied , @xmath51 will coincide with a carbon atom , which is not allowed because this implies that the carbon atom is tetravalent . at first sight",
    ", one might think that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between an index , @xmath95 , and an octahedral fullerene .",
    "but this is not true since it is possible that the octahedral fullerenes built from two different scalene triangles are in fact identical .",
    "we will study this issue in details in the next section .",
    "finally we can identify three limiting situations if one of the three sides of the scalene triangle vanishes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : limiting_cases ] ) .    1",
    ".   the first limiting situation corresponds to a vanishing triangular base vector , @xmath96 , which is referred to as type i octahedral fullerenes later on .",
    "the indices for this case have the form @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the length of the triangular base vector @xmath75 vanishes and all triangles in the cantellated cube shrink to single points .",
    "and the template polyhedron reaches the corresponding limit of the cantellation , namely the cube .",
    "note also that three pentagons fuse to form a triangle at each corner of the cube , while the octagons remain at the centers of the faces of the cube .",
    "thus , there are eight triangles and six octagons in the resulting octahedral fullerene .",
    "2 .   the second limiting situation corresponds to a vanishing square base vector , @xmath98 , which we denote as type ii .",
    "the indices for type ii fullerenes are given by @xmath99 . in this limit",
    ", the length of the square base vector @xmath75 vanishes and each square shrinks to a point .",
    "thus , the template polyhedron reaches another limit of the cantellation , namely the octahedron .",
    "this case is identical to the goldberg polyhedron illustrated in figure  [ fig : goldberg](c ) and figure  [ fig : goldberg](f ) .",
    "four pentagons and one octagon fuse to form a square at each corner of the octahedron . therefore , we have six squares in a type ii octahedral fullerene .",
    "the last limiting situation , denoted as type iii , is when the length of the third side of @xmath68 , @xmath100 , vanishes .",
    "in other words , @xmath74 is equal to @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "one can show that @xmath102 also corresponds to the same limiting case . @xmath103 and @xmath104 can be transformed to each other via additional symmetry transformations , @xmath105 or @xmath106 , which will be introduced in the next section .",
    "the indices for this type are @xmath103 or @xmath104 and the template polyhedron in this limit is a cuboctahedron .",
    "two pentagons at @xmath48 and @xmath49 fuse to become one square , and there are six octagons and twelve squares in total in this limiting case . other collinear cases do not make the third side vanish though and pentagons will not fuse at all .",
    "in fact we can use @xmath105 or @xmath106 introduced later to make these two base vectors nonparallel .",
    "when none of the sides of the scalene triangle vanishes , the corresponding octahedral fullerenes will be denoted as type iv .    ;",
    "( d)-(f ) type ii octahedral fullerene with with @xmath107 ; ( g)-(i ) type iii octahedral fullerene with @xmath108 . in this case",
    "points @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath109 are coincident.,width=566 ]",
    "in the previous section , we showed that an octahedral fullerene can be constructed by cutting a fundamental polygon specified by a four - component index and its category , @xmath95 and patching twenty - four replica of this fundamental polygon onto a cantellated cube .",
    "we also pointed that this correspondence is not one - to - one , but many - to - one , since there are some symmetry relationships in this indexing scheme .",
    "in other words , we mean that there exist different indices @xmath95 that correspond to the same molecular structure .",
    "this section is devoted to find a systematic way to eliminate all such redundancies and fully characterize the nature of the index symmetry .    in the limiting cases of octahedral fullerenes which belong to the types i to iii",
    ", we only need one independent two - component vector to specify their indices .",
    "it is obvious that the index transformation arising from the geometric symmetry of graphene will lead to the same octahedral fullerene .",
    "for instance , a @xmath110 rotation about point @xmath0 will transform the index from @xmath111 to @xmath112 without altering the resulting octahedral fullerene .",
    "therefore these two indices correspond to the same molecular structure and should only be counted once .",
    "in fact , this applies to all twelve symmetry operations belonging to the point group @xmath113 of graphene .",
    "here , we ignore symmetry operation @xmath114 that lies in the plane of graphene because it does not move any carbon atom at all .",
    "so , all indices that can be related through these symmetry operations produce the same octahedral fullerene .",
    "this set of indices is called an orbit in group theory@xcite .",
    "so to enumerate octahedral fullerene is equivalent to enumerate different orbits of all possible indices .",
    "indices belonging to the same orbit correspond to the same octahedral fullerene .",
    "in other words , only one out of the set of indices comprising an orbit is needed to represent an octahedral fullerene uniquely . in these three limiting situations",
    ", we can restrict the indices with the inequality , @xmath115 for type i , @xmath116 for type ii , and @xmath115 ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) for type iii to remove all redundancies arising from the @xmath113 symmetry operations .",
    "the situation for type iv octahedral fullerenes is more complicated .",
    "in addition to the twelve symmetry operations from the point group @xmath119 , there are three more symmetry operations , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 arising from different ways of dissecting each of the three different kinds of faces of a cantellated cube into fundamental polygons . for each dissection scheme , different squares or regular triangles",
    "are drawn , and the square or triangular base vectors will change respectively .",
    "detailed description of these three symmetry operations will be described later .",
    "these extra symmetry operations introduce redundancies which can not be removed by introducing inequalities of indices like the situations of types i to iii .",
    "although the redundancies produced by these three @xmath18-type symmetry operations can not be removed by such index restrictions , the parts of redundancies originating from the sixfold rotational symmetry of graphene can be eliminated by introducing the canonical criterion , @xmath123 .",
    "this is because that these rotational operations commute with the three @xmath18-type operations , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath124=0,$ ] where @xmath125 , @xmath25 or @xmath126 . here",
    ", we do not impose the restriction , @xmath127 , to remove the redundancies produced by the six mirror symmetries @xmath128 .",
    "this will be discussed with the @xmath94 symmetry in the next section .",
    "the symmetry operation , @xmath120 , comes from the two different ways to decompose a parallelogram as shown in figure  [ fig : t2 ] .",
    "the @xmath94 operation stands for performing a local @xmath129 operation which rotate one of base vectors by @xmath130 .",
    "thus the index @xmath131 will generate the same octahedral fullerene with @xmath67 .",
    "we can define @xmath94 explicitly with the following matrix notation @xmath132 where @xmath133 .    unlike usual matrix multiplications",
    ", we need to specify the category of the index before and after @xmath94 transformation .",
    "since @xmath82 stands for the signed area enclosed by the parallelogram spanned by these two vectors up to a positive factor , it is clear that under the transformations , @xmath94 or @xmath134 , the signed area changes sign and hence the category .",
    "this is also true in the degenerate case .",
    "therefore , enumerating indices only in a single category can remove redundancies produced by @xmath94 and @xmath134 , but not those produced by @xmath135 .",
    "symmetry operation illustrated with the example @xmath136 .",
    "if we choose @xmath137 as the index , the corresponding fundamental polygon is @xmath138 . on the other hand , if we choose the index @xmath139 , the fundamental polygon becomes @xmath140 .",
    "these two fundamental polygons essentially give the same octahedral fullerene with different ways of dissecting the parallelogram.[fig : t2],width=566 ]      the symmetry operation @xmath121 involves different ways of dissecting the equilateral triangles of the cantellated cube as shown in figure  [ fig : t3 ] .",
    "for instance , one possible choice of the two base vectors for the scalene triangle is @xmath141 .",
    "however , there is another choice , @xmath142 , which produce the same octahedral fullerene , but with a different way of dissecting the triangles of the cantellated cube .",
    "the @xmath105 transformation only changes the triangular base vectors .",
    "unlike @xmath94 and @xmath134 , the @xmath105 transformation does not change the category . moreover , for the @xmath143 transformation , which operates on octahedral fullerenes belonging to the category @xmath77 , we also need to impose an additional constraint on the domain @xmath144 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath143 can be written as @xmath145 we may obtain @xmath146 easily by @xmath147 and its domain by similar method . the inverse of @xmath105 transformation , namely @xmath148 , may be found by the usual matrix inversion , @xmath149 its domain can also be found by requiring that the category remains unchanged , @xmath150 and so we have the identity , @xmath151 .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure  [ fig : t3 ] , the @xmath105 transformation always decrease @xmath152 by more than @xmath110 ; while @xmath148 always increase @xmath152 by more than @xmath110 .     symmetry .",
    "@xmath121 transform the partition @xmath153 to @xmath154 , which can be also written as @xmath155 .",
    "similarly we have @xmath156 .",
    "[ fig : t3],width=566 ]      similar to the symmetry operations @xmath94 and @xmath105 , the operation @xmath106 involves different ways of assigning fundamental polygons on the cantellated cube as shown in figure  [ fig : t4 ] . in this case , we can see that two different fundamental polygons given by indices @xmath157 and @xmath158 are essentially equivalent in constructing an octahedral fullerene",
    ". the transformation @xmath106 does not change the category just like the transformation @xmath105 . we can interchange @xmath159 and @xmath160 by sandwiching them between the mirror transformation @xmath134 . on the other hand , in contrast to the transformation @xmath105 , @xmath106 changes the square base vector only .",
    "therefore , both @xmath105 and @xmath106 will decrease @xmath152 by more than @xmath110 .",

    ". however the whole index can be rotated back to satisfy the canonical criterion again whenever necessary .",
    "the explicit form for the symmetry operation @xmath162 can be written as @xmath163 again , an constraint on domain @xmath164 is necessary to ensure that the category stays unchanged .",
    "the inverse @xmath165 can be defined as follows @xmath166 and the constraint on the domain is @xmath167 . in summary , @xmath168 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and their inverses",
