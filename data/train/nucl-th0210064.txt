    "from more than thirty years on , two - center shell models are precious tools in the research of fusion , fission and cluster decay processes .",
    "the capability of producing transition level schemes during the splitting process from an initial parent nucleus towards two different fragments offers the opportunity of studying what are the possible microscopic changes through a certain fission or decay channel .    in 1961",
    "a symmetric double center oscillator potential has been analyzed by merzbacher @xcite .",
    "a strong link was emphasized with regard to diatomic molecules ( like ammonia molecule ) where the motion in the neighbourhood of an equilibrium state is close to the one generated by a harmonic potential .",
    "this problem has been solved for two identical spherical potential wells .    in the 1970 s , j. maruhn , w. greiner and the frankfurt school developed the asymmetric two - center shell model @xcite .",
    "it was an important step for the study of mass asymmetry in binary nuclear fission .",
    "the model considered two spherical asymmetric fragments subjected to two - oscillator type potential .",
    "a remarcable feature of this model was its ability to describe two overlapping spherical nuclei fission shapes up to their separated configuration .",
    "thus it was possible for microscopic effects to be held responsible as being specifically due to the two emerging and gradually separating level schemes .",
    "basically it is under this form that two center shell models are widely used today in nuclear fusion , fission and cluster decay phenomena .",
    "two center states in light nuclei are taken into account in connection with molecular orbitals in a two - center shell model picture @xcite .",
    "also , application of the two - center shell model on the study of @xmath3 reaction has been published @xcite with emphasis on nuclear landau - zenner effect .",
    "nucleus - nucleus collisions have also been considered in the framework of the two - center shell model to obtain the two - center level diagrams and single particle corrections for asymmetric systems such as @xmath4 @xcite .    the importance of an adequate description of cold fission , cluster radioactivities and alpha decay in terms of an asymmetric and _ deformed _ single particle shell model with more realistic shapes during fission and fusion processes was repeteadly stressed @xcite .",
    "recently , attempts have been made to use the two - center shell model in synthesis and decay of superheavy nuclei .",
    "it is a suitable theoretical model to study the microscopic effects on possible projectile - target combinations in their way from two different quantum systems to one .",
    "as the synthesized nucleus is heavier , increasing coulombian repulsion lowers the macroscopic potential barrier almost to complete dissapearance .",
    "the only way a superheavy element can survive is due to the shell effects @xcite .",
    "a two - center shell model is essential for the description of fusion and fission of superheavy elements .",
    "it shows that the shell structure of the two participating target - projectile nuclei is visible far beyond the barrier into the fusioning nucleus and is crucial in choosing the most favorable pair approaching each other through _ cold _ fusion valleys .",
    "transition behaviour of the two partner shells will provide shell corrections which lower the fusion barrier to be overcome , as compared to neighbouring projectile - target combinations .    up to now , all the variants of two - center shell models used spherical nuclei .",
    "i shall consider now the motivation of this work . in any process which implies a pass from two quantum systems to one ( fusion ) or the other way around ( fission )",
    "there are certain situations when one or both fission fragments or fusion partners are deformed .",
    "such a reaction could yield cold energy valleys due to deformed shell structure of the participants .",
    "fragment deformations are properly accounted in this work . a deformed two - center shell model ( dtcsm )",
    "is proposed , where the main part of the potential consists of two ellipsoidaly deformed nilsson type oscillators for axially symmetric shapes .",
    "any change in the nuclear surface shape is reflected in a corresponding modification of the four oscillator frequencies along the symmetry axis and perpendicular to it .",
    "it is also well established that , especially in fission and cluster decay , a necking region builds its way between the fragments , smoothly linking the two ellipsoids one to the other .",
    "this work associates for the first time a microscopic potential to a spherically matching neck region of the nuclear shape .",
    "the neck potential is constructed in such a way that it takes the same value on the necking region surface as on the ellipsoidal region surfaces of the fragments .",
    "equipotentiality is thus respected on the nuclear surface .",
    "the usual spin - orbit and squared angular momentum operators are calculated with help of the potential - dependent formulae @xmath5 , and @xmath6 @xcite . the potential in this model follows exactly the nuclear shape , and so do the @xmath7 and @xmath8 operators .",
    "finally , the levels diagram with respect to the elongation , neck parameter and fragment deformations are used to calculate the shell correction by means of the strutinsky method .",
    "calculations are presented as an example for different mass asymmetries , for the superheavy nucleus @xmath1122 and for @xmath2cf .",
    "the dependence on various neck parameter values and on different pairs of fragments is discussed .",
    "1 shows the main geometrical parameters defining the axially symmetric shape family dtcsm is dealing with .",
    "two ellipsoids ( the deformed fragments ) with semiaxes @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 are , at a certain moment , separated at a distance @xmath13 between the two centers @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a sphere centered in @xmath16 with radius @xmath17 is rolling around the symmetry axis , being tangent all the time to the two ellipsoids .",
    "the necking region , between the two tangent points , is generated in this way .",
    "thus we have five independent parameters to design the deformation space : two fragment shape asymmetries @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( if @xmath9 and @xmath11 are given as the correspondent of @xmath20 for every @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the other semiaxes are calculated from the total volume conservation condition ) , mass asymmetry @xmath23 , the neck radius @xmath17 and the distance between centers @xmath13 . obviously , this set is available for every parent nucleus @xmath24 with its own @xmath25 .",
    "a few shape sequences obtained by varying two of the parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath13 for the same parent and the same mass asymmetry @xmath23 are depicted in fig .",
    "every row starts with the same ellipsoidal parent on the left hand side of the figure .",
    "as the distance between centers increases , the two deformed fragments with fixed @xmath26 and @xmath27 shape asymmetries begin to separate one from the other .",
    "variation with the neck radius @xmath17 is noticeable on vertical direction .",
    "shape sequences with very small necking region are shown in the upper row ( for zero neck radius , @xmath28 fm , we get compact shapes suitable for fusion reactions ) , passing through intermediary neck radii , comparable to the magnitude of the ellipsoids semiaxes ( second and third row ) , down to the last row where large neck radius generates very elongated shapes .",
    "this kind of configurations will be microscopically treated along the variation of the deformation space parameters .",
    "the equations for shape surfaces described in the previous section can be written in cylindrical coordinates ( due to axyal symmetry ) as :    @xmath29^{1/2 } & -a_1 \\leq z \\leq z_{c1 } \\\\ \\rho _",
    "g(z)= &   \\rho _ 3- [ r_3 ^ 2-(z - z_3)^2]^{1/2 } , & z_{c1 } \\leq z \\leq z_{c2 } \\\\ \\rho _",
    "2(z)= & [ b_2 ^ 2 - \\chi _ 2(z - r)^2]^{1/2 } , & z_{c2 }",
    "\\leq z \\leq r+a_2 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where the origin is placed in the center of the heavy fragment @xmath14 .",
    "neck sphere center coordinates are @xmath30 , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the two tangent points of the neck sphere with the two ellipsoids .",
    "the oscillator potential correspondig to these two - center shapes must have the same value on the nuclear surface . for spheres ,",
    "for example we have :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the radii of a nucleus with atomic mass @xmath35 . since @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 1.16 ) then @xmath39 mev .",
    "if we write these simple relations for the surface of ellipsoidal shapes :    @xmath40    the frequencies @xmath41 , @xmath42 are defined along the symmetry axis and respectively perpendicular to it , as functions of the two ellipse semiaxes .    for an arbitrary origin , placed on the symmetry axis ,",
    "the ellipsoids surface equations read :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the absolute values of each of the two centers coordinates . now",
    "the two oscillator potential expressions for deformed fragments come straightforward :    @xmath46    what we have left to establish is the necking region potential , @xmath47 .",
    "the force that keeps nucleons confined within the ellipsoid is an attractive type one , radially inward ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the same reason leads us to the hypothesis that , if nucleons are confined within the concave necking region , which is geometrically _ inversed _ to the ellipsoid convex surface with respect to the centers of the fragments , a rejective force is needed , radially outward :    @xmath49    hence a force oriented from outside the nuclear shape toward the surface .",
    "then the corresponding potential is related to the expression :    @xmath50    or    @xmath51    consequently , @xmath52 is a potential form generating the rejective force . in this way ,",
    "the rejective neck potential , defined up to a constant , must look like :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is a constant to be determined . on the nuclear surface @xmath55 , we have again :    @xmath56    or    @xmath57    for the sake of consistency , the rejective force is also considered of oscillator type :    @xmath58    therefore @xmath59 where the frequency @xmath60 has to be found .",
    "since the potential must follow the geometrical shape , at the neck region the function @xmath61 reads :    @xmath62\\ ] ]    and is centered in the middle of the neck sphere @xmath63 . on the neck surface",
    "then , where @xmath64 , we have :    @xmath65    then @xmath66 and the total neck potential from outside the shape down to the surface is :    @xmath67\\ ] ]    and the neck frequency is directly related to the neck radius by eq .",

    "it can be observed that on the ellipsoids surface _ inside _ the shape the deformed oscillator potential has the same value as on the fragments surface , namely @xmath74 .",
    "but on the surface of the shape within the necking region , the value is also @xmath74 .",
    "then , one concludes that inside the region volume between the neck surface and the two ellipsoids surfaces - @xmath75 and @xmath76 - the neck potential is constant .",

    "these regions are about to be revealed further on .",
    "one of the most important issues for the two - center shell models is that the separation plane between the two fragments is not the one where the potentials equal eachother . as an example , for compact shapes ( no neck , @xmath28 ) the points ( @xmath83 ) on the separation line ( where the two ellipsae intersect ) result in different values for the potentials , @xmath84 .",
    "the sharp cusp between the two values makes calculation totally wrong .",
    "attempts to solve the problem by a geometrical transition function , making the frequency @xmath85 join @xmath86 introduce an unpredictible approximation which is bigger as the mass asymmetry is larger ; moreover , it does not reproduce the neck spherical shape and still , only the @xmath87part of the potential is solved .    in conclusion",
    ", one has to divide the hilbert space such that the _ whole _",
    "potential @xmath88 could smoothly and continuosly pass from one fragment to the neck and finally to the other fragment .",
    "first , let us take the deformed fragment oscillators into consideration and find out what are the spatial limits of continuity between the two potentials .",
    "the equation for such a region must be complacent with the matching condition :    @xmath89    where    @xmath90    or    @xmath91    if one translates the @xmath92coordinate :    @xmath93    and separate the terms with respect to the powers of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we get :    @xmath96    we notice that :    @xmath97    and after some simple calculations one obtains :    @xmath98    which defines a so called unique center surface , here namely an ellipsoid with semiaxes :    @xmath99 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the origin of this surface is at @xmath100 , its center with respect to the arbitrary origin ( against which the potentials are expressed ) is on the symmetry axis at :    @xmath101    what we have obtained are the coordinates @xmath102 and the semiaxes @xmath103 of a matching potential ellipsoid ( mpe ) . on its surface @xmath104 .",
    "the heavy deformed fragment @xmath14 is acting through @xmath105 outside the mpe .",
    "the light fragment part which emerges from the parent is contained inside mpe ( the shaded region in fig .",
    "3 ) . hence its action on the hilbert space , @xmath106 , goes all over the matching ellipsoid volume .",
    "the same demonstration is valid for @xmath107 , and @xmath108 , as far as the neck potential shares its action space with the fragments .",
    "first condition :    @xmath109    or @xmath110\\ ] ] yields :    @xmath111    this equation is of the type :    @xmath112    to describe a unique center surface , the normalized determinant of the equation :    @xmath113    must be positive , which is the casefor our situation .",
    "then the center of the surface has the coordinates :    @xmath114    after some simple calculations one obtains :    @xmath115    this surface is again an ellipsoid with semiaxes :    @xmath116    and represents the matching potential ellipsoid ( mpe1 ) between @xmath105 and @xmath117 . on its surface ,",
    "the two values equal each other . obviously , the tangent point between this first matching potential ellipsoid and the heavy fragment shape is the same as the tangent point between the neck sphere and the heavy fragment . in the interior of mpe1 ,",
    "the dtcsm potential is @xmath117 .",
    "following the same arguments for :    @xmath118    one finds :    @xmath119    for the center of the second neck matching potential ellipsoid ( mpe2 ) , and the same expressions with @xmath106 corresponding values instead of @xmath120 hold for the semiaxes @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    in the upper part of fig .",
    "3 , the three matching ellipsoids - the large shaded one for @xmath123 ( mpe ) and the two grey ones for @xmath124 ( mpe1 ) and @xmath125 ( mpe2 ) respectively - are drawn . in this way",
    "dtcsm potential spans the whole hilbert space as follows : within mpe it is @xmath106 which is active ; within the grey area formed by the two neck potential matching ellipsoids , mpe1 and mpe2 , we have @xmath117 ; in the interior of the nuclear shape , between the neck surface and the fragment ellipsoids surfaces ( tiny black region ) the potential is @xmath126 .",
    "the rest of the space is under @xmath105 action .",
    "what is achieved in this section is spanning the hilbert space by dtcsm potential , passing continuously from the potential generated by the heavy fragment @xmath120 to the lighter one @xmath127 and allowing also for the neck to be smoothly shaped by @xmath128 .",
    "there are no sharp cusps in the potential values .",

    "the new feature in the dtcsm eigenvalue problem is the shape - dependency of the potentials : @xmath144 , the spin - orbit term @xmath145 and the @xmath146 term ( @xmath147 is preferred here as a notation since the angular momentum operator , as being shape dependent , will be different from the usual @xmath148 ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian :    @xmath149    is obviously not separable .",
    "a basis is needed and diagonalization of oscillator potential differences and of angular momentum dependent operators has to be performed .",
    "a separable hamiltonian is obtained if one takes @xmath150 , with no @xmath151 and @xmath152 terms , hence a potential like :    @xmath153    this is an appropiate two - center potential for a sphere ( @xmath154 ) intersected with a vertical spheroid .",
