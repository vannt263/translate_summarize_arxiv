    "as first demonstrated by @xcite , radiation pressure must dominate gas pressure in the innermost parts of black hole accretion disks radiating at any non - negligible fraction of the eddington limit .",
    "although the original argument made use of the assumption that the stress and the pressure are related by a fixed ratio @xmath0 , the critical radius within which radiation pressure exceeds gas pressure depends so weakly on the value of @xmath0 that this conclusion would be virtually unaltered even if the ratio of stress to pressure varied substantially from place to place . in this sense , the expectation of radiation dominance in the inner rings of brightly - radiating accretion disks rests only on the supposition that stress and pressure are comparable , the dimensional analysis foundation from which the @xmath0 model began .",
    "it is therefore crucial that we understand the role that radiation pressure plays in the physics of accretion disks if we are to understand luminous black hole sources . yet , for the past thirty years the canonical internal equilibrium of disks in the radiation - dominated limit has been believed to be unstable @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other physical regimes , the vertical structure of a stationary disk is in some ways very tightly constrained if radiation pressure truly dominates the hydrostatic support of the disk against the tidal gravitational field of the hole . neglecting relativistic corrections for simplicity",
    ", one finds that the outward radiation flux in a geometrically thin disk as a function of height @xmath3 above the midplane is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the speed of light , @xmath6 is the opacity ( usually dominated by electron scattering ) , and the orbital angular velocity @xmath7 determines the vertical tidal gravitational acceleration @xmath8 . because energy conservation in a time - steady disk demands ( if we neglect inner boundary condition effects ) that the flux emerging from the disk surface is @xmath9 , the half - thickness @xmath10 of the disk depends only on the accretion rate @xmath11 and is independent of radius and the nature of the turbulent stress : @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , equation ( [ eqfz ] ) combined with the condition of radiative equilibrium immediately implies that the dissipation rate per unit volume @xmath13 is constant as a function of height above the disk midplane : @xmath14 .",
    "given that @xmath13 must , on average , be given by the turbulent stress @xmath15 times the rate of strain @xmath16 , we also have a tight constraint on the vertically - averaged stress : @xmath17 a conclusion first reached in slightly different form by @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , other aspects of radiation - dominated disks are left totally unconstrained . because @xmath6 ( when it is dominated by electron scattering ) is independent of density , the vertical density profile @xmath18 is completely irrelevant to both the hydrostatic and the thermal equilibrium of the disk . in the absence of additional information about how the dissipation rate depends on density ,",
    "it is therefore completely undetermined , and even within shakura - sunyaev models it must be specified in some _ ad hoc _ manner .",
    "often it is assumed that the dissipation rate per unit mass is constant , which leads to a vertically constant density out to the photospheres .",
    "this element of arbitrariness is in addition , of course , to the _ ad hoc _ `` @xmath0-viscosity '' prescription for the stress used in such models .",
    "the freedom to choose arbitrary values of @xmath0 in that stress prescription has always been one of its unfortunate aspects , but in the radiation pressure dominated regime we also have freedom in the choice of which pressure with which to scale the stress .",
    "the standard @xcite assumption is that the stress @xmath15 should be proportional to the total ( gas plus radiation ) pressure , and this choice leads to both thermal ( e.g. @xcite ) and `` viscous '' ( more properly ,  inflow \" ; @xcite ) instabilities where the radiation to gas pressure ratio exceeds 3/2 .",
    "the thermal instabilities generally have faster growth rates than the inflow modes , and are the ones of primary interest here .",
    "the origin of the thermal instability is most simply expressed in terms of the different dependences of the heating and cooling rates on the midplane temperature @xmath19 , assuming constant surface mass density @xmath20 @xcite . in the limit of radial wavelength",
    "long compared to the disk thickness , radiative diffusion implies that the cooling rate per unit area @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radiation density constant .",
    "this must balance the heating rate per unit area @xmath23 .",
    "combining these two expressions with the @xmath0-prescription @xmath24 and the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium , we find @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thermal instability follows because positive temperature perturbations lead to greater increases in heating than in cooling .",
    "it is also possible to express these relationships in terms of the total radiation energy content per unit area @xmath27 , in which case @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; once again , instability is indicated .",
    "however , it has never been clear whether the assumption that the stress is proportional to the radiation pressure is correct , and the existence of the thermal instability has therefore always been suspect .",
    "alternative prescriptions that make the stress proportional to either the gas pressure alone or some combination of the gas and radiation pressure have been advocated over the years , and give rise to more stable configurations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , all of these prescriptions refer to vertically - integrated or one - zone vertical structure models of the accretion disk .",
    "the actual vertical distribution of dissipation may also be important .",
    "if much of the local accretion power is actually dissipated in optically thin regions above and below the disk , then the disk itself can become supported by gas pressure and there would then be no thermal instability @xcite .",
    "it is now widely believed that the turbulence in black hole accretion disks resembles that seen in simulations of the nonlinear development of the magnetorotational instability ( mri , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such simulations , if they include radiation physics , could in principle help resolve these uncertainties by calculating the spatial and temporal structure of the turbulent dissipation within the disk , and checking to see whether a long - lived , and therefore presumably stable , equilibrium exists in the radiation pressure dominated regime .",
    "it may also be possible to investigate the scaling of average turbulent stresses with local averages of gas and/or radiation pressure using the data from these simulations .",
    "well - resolved , global simulations of optically thick accretion disks that include radiation transport have not yet been published , but it is computationally feasible to investigate the thermal physics locally within the disk using a stratified shearing box geometry @xcite . the necessity of ( sheared)-periodic radial boundary conditions zeroes any net accretion rate through the box , precluding any investigation of inflow instabilities , but thermal instabilities can still be studied .",
    "these same boundary conditions also preclude studying any modes with wavelengths longer than twice the box width , except for infinite wavelength modes  the sheared periodic radial boundary conditions place no restriction on modes that are completely independent of radius .    the first attempt at this was made by @xcite , who performed a radiation magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of a stratified shearing box resulting in an average midplane radiation to gas pressure ratio of 14 . despite this large ratio ,",
    "the simulation produced no obvious thermal instability over eight thermal times .",
    "the robustness of this result is somewhat suspect , however , given that the computational methods employed precluded the photospheres ( top and bottom ) from being included within the simulation domain .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 of the work done on the box disappeared due to numerical losses , and half the mass was lost from the simulation domain during a heating / expansion phase .",
    "more recently , we @xcite developed numerical techniques that conserve energy with high accuracy , place both photospheres within the problem volume , and retain nearly all the initial mass on the grid . solving the total energy equation enables us to capture all grid scale losses of magnetic and kinetic energy and convert them to internal energy in the gas . furthermore , by simultaneously solving the internal energy equation , we can compute the instantaneous local losses of magnetic and kinetic energy , i.e. the energy dissipation rate .",
    "the only violations of energy conservation come from the small amounts of energy ( generally @xmath31% of the total dissipated energy for the labels . ] ) artificially injected by the action of the density floor and similar numerical limiters . using this code , we have previously studied a case in which gas pressure dominated over radiation pressure @xcite and , in @xcite , one in which the gas and radiation pressures were comparable .    both of the simulations studied in our previous papers achieved a thermal balance between heating and cooling on time scales comparable to the thermal time .",
    "however , no real steady state was achieved in the simulation with comparable gas and radiation pressure . instead",
    ", there were long term ( @xmath32 thermal times ) up and down variations in total energy content by factors of three to four .",
    "the two hottest epochs in this simulation marginally violated the thermal instability criterion of @xcite , but no thermal runaway occurred .    in this paper we present results of two simulations that are in the fully radiation pressure dominated regime , with box - integrated radiation to gas pressure ratios",
    "the two simulations shared the same parameters , boundary conditions , and ( almost ) the same initial conditions , differing only in the small noise fluctuations imposed on the initial state to seed the mri . despite being in gross violation of the standard thermal instability criterion , there is no evidence for such an instability in either of their time evolutions , which in both cases extended over @xmath34 thermal times .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize how the code works and discuss the parameters of the new simulations .",
    "quantitative results about the thermodynamics , internal vertical structures , and variability of the simulations are presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we discuss a simple model that might explain the thermal stability we observe , and we summarize our findings in section 5 .",

    "a more complete description of the fld approximation is found in @xcite .    the gas and radiation exchange both momentum and energy via electron scattering and free - free emission / absorption .",
    "for free - free absorption , the planck - mean opacity and rosseland - mean opacity are computed as @xmath54 @xmath55/g and @xmath56 @xmath55/g .",
    "the electron scattering opacity is assumed to be @xmath57 @xmath55/g .",

    "to simulate the dynamics in a section of an orbiting disk , we adopt the shearing box approximation , in which the sum of the coriolis force , the tidal force , and the vertical gravitational force , @xmath61 , is added to the rhs of the momentum equation .",
    "neglecting orbital curvature , we denote the radial coordinate , azimuthal coordinate , and vertical coordinate by the cartesian coordinates @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath3 .",
    "we solved these equations using a modified version of the zeus code for radiation mhd described in @xcite .",
    "this version differs from the standard implementation of zeus in two main respects .",

    "two parameters determine the problem in this context : the angular velocity @xmath7 and the surface density @xmath20 .",
    "using standard orbital mechanics and the radiation - dominated limit of the @xmath0 model , these quantities can be written as functions of the central black hole mass @xmath64 , the radius @xmath65 , and the mass accretion rate @xmath11 for a guessed value of @xmath0 ( krolik 1999 ) : @xmath66 @xmath67 as we have already explained , in a time - steady disk , the assumptions of radiative support against vertical gravity and energy conservation can be used to relate the disk vertical thickness @xmath10 and the radiated flux @xmath68 to @xmath69 and @xmath7 : @xmath70 @xmath71 however , properly speaking , @xmath10 and @xmath68 ( as well as @xmath69 ) are driven by local disk dynamics and are in general time - dependent ; thus , these relations should be regarded as guesses that may or may not be confirmed .",

    "we refer to these two simulations as 1112a and 1126b , and we now discuss their properties .",
    "we are interested in the stability of disk segments in which the surface mass density is constant . to keep @xmath20 steady ,",
    "the box height must be chosen carefully because our boundary conditions permit outflows at the top and bottom of the simulation box , but forbid inflows .",
    "consequently , mass is lost comparatively readily in a shorter box , but mass can be added in a taller box due to more frequent application of the code s density floor when inflows are shut off . in simulations 1112a and 1126b , we set the box height at @xmath120 , which results in variations of the surface mass density of less than @xmath121 ( fig.[fig : surface_density_variation ] ) .",

    "there are at least 8 cells per wavelength ( and generally a great many more ) everywhere in the box except near the midplane during a few brief epochs ( e.g. @xmath124 in 1112a ) .",
    "the quality of our results also depends on keeping both the top and bottom photospheres within the simulation domain at all times .",
    "[ fig : mriresolution_photosphere ] also shows the locations of the photospheres in both simulations ; we define the photosphere by the place where the eddington factor @xmath125 , for @xmath126 the horizontally - averaged dimensionless opacity parameter .",

    "the thermal history of the two simulations is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fluxesenergiesvst1112a ] and [ fig : fluxesenergiesvst1126b ] .",
    "the top panel in each figure shows the volume integrated dissipation rate per unit surface area of the box ( red ) and the total radiative flux leaving the top and bottom faces of the box ( blue ) , both on a linear scale .",
    "this panel shows clearly that the box is able to maintain a close thermal balance on timescales very short compared to the durations of these simulations .",
    "the bottom panels show the total radiation , gas internal , magnetic , and turbulent kinetic energies in the box on a logarithmic scale to emphasize better the relative fluctuations in each of these quantities .",
    "if we define the unit of energy content as the gas thermal energy and consider both simulations together , the radiation energy can range from @xmath12730 , the magnetic energy from @xmath1281 , and the kinetic energy from @xmath1290.25 . adopting a nominal radiative efficiency of 0.1",
    ", we find that the mean stress in simulation 1112a would drive an accretion rate relative to eddington of 0.17 , while in 1126b it would have been 0.23 .",
    "thus , even when averaging over relatively long timescales , the mean accretion rate for this surface density and orbital frequency is still uncertain at the level of several tens of percent .",
    "a number of interesting results are apparent in these figures , but the one that is most significant is the fact that an approximate thermal equilibrium has been established in both simulations .",
    "the thermal time as measured by the radiation and gas internal energies divided by the total radiative flux has short time scale fluctuations , but averaging over timescales @xmath130  orbits , we find that in both simulations the instantaneous cooling time can be anywhere from @xmath131  orbits at times of relatively low energy content to @xmath132  orbits at times of especially high energy in the box . averaged over the entire duration , the cooling time is 13  orbits in 1112a , and slightly longer , 15.5  orbits , in 1126b .",
    "thus , both simulations ran for @xmath2 thermal times , and yet there is no evidence of runaway heating and cooling .",
    "@xcite predicted that thermal instability should occur whenever the ratio of radiation to gas pressure exceeds 3/2 , but the radiation to gas energy ratios encountered here translate to pressure ratios @xmath13315 , well above the predicted instability threshold .",
    "although it does appear that a crude long - term mean value for the energy content can be estimated , the amplitude of fluctuations on timescales a significant fraction of the simulation duration is still quite large .",
    "we quantify these fluctuations by several measures .",
    "first , we note that transients associated with the initial condition are generally erased by @xmath134 orbits into the simulation . discounting that initial period",
    ", we see that the typical fluctuation amplitudes in the radiation , magnetic , and kinetic energy are similar , all factors of several , but the fluctuation levels in the gas energy are much smaller , only @xmath135  rms .",
    "this means that the dissipated magnetic and kinetic energies are readily converted to radiation energy . on the other hand , although there is considerable high - frequency power in the magnetic and kinetic energy fluctuations , there is much less in the radiation energy .",
    "that this should be so is not surprising : the turbulence driving the magnetic and kinetic energy densities has a characteristic timescale of order an orbit , whereas the radiation energy changes on a thermal timescale , an order of magnitude longer .",
    "these remarks can be quantified by studying the power spectra of the fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : erdemgpowerspec ] illustrates the case of 1112a ; 1126b is qualitatively similar ) .",
    "the offset between the magnetic and radiation fourier power spectra is a measure of the larger contribution from short timescale fluctuations in the time series of magnetic energy . only at the very longest timescales",
    "does the variance in the radiation energy become similar to that in the magnetic energy ( and also at very short timescales , where the fluctuation amplitude is extremely small ) .",
    "more quantitatively , both power spectra can be approximately described by broken power - laws : @xmath136 the first number in each exponent is the low - frequency slope ; the second number is the high - frequency slope . in both cases ,",
    "the break occurs at @xmath12710 orbital periods , about half the thermal timescale . at high frequencies , both power spectra decline quite steeply . on the other hand , at low frequencies ,",
    "both power spectra are  red \" enough that the variance is dominated by the low - frequency cut - off posed by the duration of the simulation .",
    "this  infrared divergence \" is weak  almost logarithmic  for the magnetic fluctuations , but is rather stronger for the radiation spectrum . as we will argue in   4 ,",
    "the significant power at very long timescales in the magnetic fluctuations is an important element in explaining these disk segments thermal stability . as we will also argue , the fact that the two power spectra approach one another at the lowest frequencies is a symptom of the fact that mhd turbulence drives both , so that they must approximately coincide on timescales longer than the thermal equilibration time .",
    "the essence of the @xmath0 model is the expectation that the stress should be proportional to pressure .",
    "we examine the validity of this expectation in fig .",
    "[ fig : emag_erad ] , but using the box - integrated magnetic energy as a stand - in for the stress .",
    "as this figure shows , the two do tend to vary together , but with order unity fluctuations about the trend .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the least squares fit shown in the figure is 0.71 , indicating that the relation is shallower than linear . for future reference ( this relationship will be called upon in ",
    "4 ) , we also display ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcool_erad ] ) the analogous relationship between @xmath137 and the integrated radiation energy .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the fit in that case is 0.32 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the slopes of these relations are subject to some chaotic variation : the magnetic  radiation energy correlation has slope 0.79 and the thermal time ",
    "radiation energy correlation has slope 0.44 in simulation 1126b .",
    "casual study of figs .",
    "[ fig : fluxesenergiesvst1112a ] , [ fig : fluxesenergiesvst1126b ] , and [ fig : emag_erad ] suggests that , after allowance for the smoother variations in the radiation energy , all the contributions to the energy content are well - correlated in time .",
    "this is almost true . a cross - correlation between them ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energiescrosscorr ] ) reveals , however , that fluctuations in the magnetic energy _ lead _ those in the radiation energy ( and those in the gas energy ) by 515  orbits , roughly a thermal time . in   4",
    ", we will show that this fact is a crucial clue for understanding the boxes thermal stability .",
    "the turbulent kinetic energy , on the other hand ( and unsurprisingly ) is closely coincident in time with the turbulent magnetic energy .",
    "we close this subsection by remarking on the quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) that appears in the power spectrum of radiation energy at a frequency slightly higher than the orbital frequency .",
    "we believe this to be a vertical acoustic oscillation . standing vertical acoustic waves in a polytropic , newtonian",
    ", keplerian disk can occur at angular frequencies given by @xmath138^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is an integer greater than or equal to two and @xmath140 is the polytropic index @xcite .",
    "the lowest frequency of this spectrum , @xmath141 , fits the qpo exactly for a radiation pressure supported configuration ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the eigenfunction of this mode takes the form of a vertical breathing mode , with fluid displacements expanding and contracting symmetrically about a node at the midplane .",
    "as we discuss in section 3.4 below , this mode plays an important role in reconciling the actual vertical profiles of turbulent stress and dissipation with the constraints of thermal and hydrostatic equilibrium .      in the original form of the @xmath0-model",
    ", it is supposed that the stress bears a fixed ratio to the total pressure .",
    "however , it has also been proposed @xcite , usually with a view toward quenching the thermal instability , that the stress might instead scale more closely with the gas pressure alone , or with the geometric mean of the gas and radiation pressures .",
    "we can test these hypotheses with our simulation data .",
    "[ fig : taurphi1112a ] shows the time dependence of the box average of the @xmath143 component of the maxwell and turbulent reynolds stress in simulation 1112a . the fact that it has considerable short timescale fluctuation power immediately rules out the possibility that it should respond to either the gas pressure or the radiation pressure in all respects because their histories show only very weak short timescale fluctuations .",
    "the large amplitude fluctuations in the stress over long timescales similarly show that it can not be driven , even in an averaged sense , by the gas pressure , for the fluctuations in the gas pressure are far too small . that the volume - averaged stress is at all times well below the critical stress for pure radiation support demonstrates that , although radiation pressure truly dominates in the central part of the disk , other mechanisms ( notably magnetic pressure , as we will show in   3.4 )",
    "account for support against vertical gravity in substantial portions of the total simulation volume .    to make this point very explicit ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavst1112a ] the time - dependence of the ratio of the box - integrated stress to the different box - integrated candidate pressure quantities for simulation 1112a .",
    "that is , these curves show the time - dependent shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 parameter for various stress prescriptions",
    ". the best would presumably be the one that gives a value of @xmath0 that varies least with time .",
    "the least variation ( taking the stress divided by the gas plus radiation pressure ) is a factor of 4 , while the greatest variation ( found when the stress is measured in units of the gas pressure ) is a factor of 10 . in _ no _ case , therefore , does the stress follow exactly the fluctuations in any of these pressure measures .",
    "it is worth remarking in this context that the mean value of the ratio of integrated stress to integrated total pressure was 0.023 in 1112a and 0.019 in 1126b . in our previous simulations ,",
    "this number was @xmath144 ( for the @xmath145 simulation reported in @xcite ) and 0.016 ( for the @xmath146 simulation of @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we see little trend in this ratio as a function of the ratio of radiation to gas pressure . in addition , this series of simulations is , somewhat inadvertently , a crude test of numerical convergence . due both to the requirements of the simulations and to the increase in available computational power over time ,",
    "the resolutions employed have improved steadily from one to the next .",
    "measured in terms of our estimated scale - height , the cell - size @xmath147 changed from @xmath148 in the gas - dominated simulation to @xmath149 in the @xmath145 simulation to @xmath150 in the simulations presented here .",
    "the rough constancy of the stress / pressure ratio across these simulations is of some interest in view of reports that _ unstratified _ shearing box simulations show a declining ratio of stress to pressure as resolution improves @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that these unstratified simulations had zero net magnetic flux , whereas our stratified simulations have a net azimuthal flux , albeit one that is not preserved by the boundary conditions and fluctuates in direction over the course of the simulations .      as first pointed out by @xcite , in any radiation - dominated geometrically - thin disk",
    ", there is a characteristic emissivity per unit volume : @xmath151 .",
    "its existence follows immediately from attributing hydrostatic balance to radiation force .",
    "when that condition is met ( and the opacity is purely electron scattering ) , @xmath152 differentiating both sides with respect to height @xmath3 gives @xmath153 if all the dissipation is transformed locally into photon energy , there is a corresponding characteristic dissipation rate @xmath154 .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dissprofile ] ) that the dissipation rate is comparable to @xmath155 through most of the disk body , but is typically somewhat greater at @xmath156 ( by @xmath157 ) and rather less in the upper disk . at all altitudes",
    "it is dominated by magnetic losses .",
    "if hydrostatic balance obtains ( as we will show shortly , departures are almost always small ) , where @xmath158 over a significant range in height , it must be that @xmath159 because otherwise the flux would exceed the value whose force balances gravity .",
    "consequently , not all the energy liberated by dissipation goes directly into radiation flux . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxesprofile ] , for @xmath160 , a noticeable ( but minority : @xmath161 ) fraction of the vertical energy flux is in the form of photons advected upward _ with _ the matter ( @xmath162 ) , rather than diffusing through it ( @xmath163 ) ; because this component does not move through the matter , it exerts no force . like the total radiation content in the box",
    ", the advective energy flux also oscillates with the frequency of the fundamental vertical breathing mode .",
    "if this oscillation behaved with exact symmetry in its outward and inward moving phases , it would carry no net energy .",
    "however , at the outer surface of the region of significant advection ( @xmath164 ) , we see a divergence of the diffusive flux that exceeds the local dissipation rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : divfluxesprofile ] ) ; that is , radiation energy diffuses out of the upwelling matter at the top of its oscillatory range . in this respect ,",
    "the radiative advection seen here resembles convection , although the vertical gas motions are acoustic in nature and not due to buoyancy .",
    "in addition , a smaller amount of energy is carried upward by work done by radiation pressure forces and by poynting flux @xmath165 , which also oscillates with the frequency of the breathing mode .",
    "clearly , mhd flux - freezing causes magnetic energy to be advected with the gas along with radiation energy in the breathing mode .",
    "the energy transported by radiation advection , work done by radiation pressure , and poynting flux is deposited ( or dissipated ) around @xmath166 . above this point ,",
    "the energy flux is overwhelmingly due to radiation diffusion .",
    "energy transport by gas advection @xmath167 and gas pressure work is negligible throughout the simulation domain .",
    "[ fig : dissprofile ] also shows the vertical profile of stress times rate of strain , @xmath168 .",
    "this profile is significantly more concentrated near the midplane and at @xmath169 than the dissipation profile , indicating that the work done by the turbulent stresses is , in the time average , partly dissipated locally and partly converted into mechanical energy of gas motion , which is then transported vertically primarily by poynting flux and radiation pressure work associated with the breathing mode and dissipated farther out .",
    "this energy is deposited well outside the peak region of stress , and subsequently carried further outward by radiative diffusion .",
    "this supplemental energy transport mechanism contributes to @xmath170 , helping to maintain radiation - aided support against gravity at altitudes higher than one might expect if dissipation correlated perfectly with local stress .",
    "the net result of these processes is illustrated most clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : divfluxesprofile ] . as this figure shows , despite the peaks in @xmath13 that reach well above @xmath155 , the divergence of the radiation flux @xmath163 is kept just under @xmath171 across the entire central body of the disk , from @xmath172 to @xmath173 .",
    "it is the radiation advection flux @xmath162 that compensates for the excess dissipated energy @xmath174 and carries it away .",
    "thus , thermal balance is locally maintained in the entire region , as evidenced by the fact that the divergence of the summed radiation and gas energy fluxes ( @xmath175 ) matches the dissipation rate @xmath13 very well . at the same time , poynting flux @xmath165 and the flux of work done by radiation pressure forces transports non - dissipated excess mechanical energy away from the midplane to be dissipated further out .",
    "the sum of the divergences of all these energy fluxes ( together with advection of gas energy and work done by gas pressure , which are both small ) compensates exactly for the work done on the fluid by turbulent stresses , thereby establishing global energy conservation .",
    "consistent with the rough match between @xmath13 and @xmath155 , most of the vertical support , particularly in the center of the disk , is due to radiation forces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vertaccelerations ] ) and hydrostatic balance is maintained quite closely .",
    "in fact , departures from time - averaged hydrostatic balance are smaller , in fractional terms , than any local deviation ( again time - averaged ) between @xmath13 and @xmath155 . in general terms , this occurs because the timescale for dynamical equilibration ( @xmath176 ) is the shortest timescale in the system . in detail ,",
    "two different effects account for the fact that deviations from hydrostatic balance are so small . as just discussed , in the disk body , where @xmath158 , some of the vertical energy transport is carried by other mechanisms , notably radiation advection ( fig .  [ fig : fluxesprofile ] ) . at higher altitudes",
    ", vertical support depends more on the gradient of magnetic pressure than on the gradient of radiation pressure .",
    "the structure that is established by these several forces is very similar qualitatively to the structure seen in all previous vertically - stratified shearing - box simulations with genuine thermodynamics : a central region ( @xmath177 ) supported by a combination of gas and radiation pressure lying within an outer region dominated by magnetic forces . within the magnetically - dominated region , the outward force due to the magnetic pressure gradient",
    "is substantially cancelled ( in the mean ) by the inward force due to magnetic tension ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vertaccelerations ] ) .",
    "the resulting profiles of density and pressure are roughly exponential ( figs .",
    "[ fig : densitytavg ] and [ fig : pressurestavg ] ) .",
    "an exponential description is particularly good for the density , with time - averaged scale - height @xmath178 .",
    "however , we caution that the instantaneous scale - height can vary by order unity as the radiation energy varies up and down .",
    "it is also appropriate to remark at this point that , contrary to the simple assumption made in classical @xmath0-models , the density is very far from constant because the dissipation per unit mass is also very far from constant . as we have found in earlier vertically - stratified studies with smaller ratios of radiation to gas pressure , the dissipation rate per unit mass increases with decreasing mass column density to the nearest outer surface .    the pressures , while still behaving roughly as exponentials in height , have additional structure .",
    "the radiation pressure declines more steeply within @xmath179 than without because the density drops so steeply outward . from the photosphere",
    "outward , the radiation pressure changes only slowly with height because that is the free - streaming limit in plane - parallel geometry .",
    "the magnetic pressure profile , on the other hand , is roughly flat - topped in the central disk , with a pair of weak local maxima at @xmath180 . in that central region ,",
    "the plasma @xmath181 , but it drops rapidly outward , falling below unity at @xmath182 where the magnetic pressure begins to dominate the total .",

    "[ fig : photospheres ] shows the height of the scattering and thermalization photospheres as functions of time for simulation 1112a .",
    "these photospheres are defined as the surfaces where the horizontally averaged scattering optical depth and geometric mean of the scattering and planck mean absorption optical depths , respectively , equal unity .",
    "the time - averaged height of the thermalization photosphere in simulation 1112a was @xmath184 , in approximate agreement with the height at which the time - averaged gas and radiation temperatures begin to separate in fig .",
    "[ fig : temperatures_0 - 610 ] .",
    "the scattering photosphere is of course further out , with a time - averaged height of @xmath185 .",
    "[ fig : rhofluct ] shows that very large density fluctuations are always present at both the thermalization and scattering photospheres of the horizontally averaged structure .",
    "similarly large density fluctuations in the photospheres have been seen in all our previous simulations ( see fig .",
    "16 in @xcite ) , and are due to the fluctuating magnetic forces that dominate all other forces in these regions .",
    "we close this section by remarking that we have confirmed many of the results seen in the radiation pressure dominated simulation of @xcite , despite the fact that that simulation was not fully energy conserving , nor did it include the photospheres within the simulation domain . in particular , he also found no thermal instability and a vertical density profile that was highly concentrated toward the midplane .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhofluctmidplane ] , we also find similarly small density fluctuations near the midplane , of at most a factor @xmath186 between maximum and minimum .",
    "the magnetic pressure profile in his simulation had a double - peaked structure that was lower than the gas pressure at the midplane , but exceeded the gas pressure further out , also in agreement with what we have found .",
    "however , his magnetic pressure nowhere exceeded the radiation pressure , in contrast to the outermost layers in our simulation .",
    "moreover , he found that radiative diffusion carried only two - thirds of the outward energy flux , with radiation advection being the most important secondary coolant .",
    "these differences can perhaps be ascribed to the fact that his simulation did not include the photospheres .",
    "if we neglected the data from our simulations outside @xmath187 , we would see results qualitatively similar to his .",
    "the only respect in which we really disagree is that @xcite also claimed that radiation damping @xcite contributed @xmath188 of the heating in the midplane regions of his simulation .",
    "however , we have demonstrated a complete accounting of the thermal energy balance without calculating the contribution from this process at all .",
    "turner computed the radiation damping rate by integrating @xmath189 over the midplane region of his box , with @xmath190 where radiation dominates and is isotropic .",
    "this is a reasonable method in a nonstratified shearing box @xcite because the volume is fixed : consequently , the _ net _ compressive work indicates non - adiabatic behavior .",
    "however , in a stratified shearing box , @xmath191 is really a piece of the divergence of the flux of work done by radiation pressure , @xmath192 , and we have shown that this plays a contributing role to transporting excess mechanical energy out of the midplane by the breathing mode to be dissipated further out . moreover , even if we follow turner in using @xmath193 to provide an estimate of the radiation damping near the midplane , we then find that this can be at most @xmath194 and @xmath195 percent of the dissipation in the midplane region in 1112a and 1126b , respectively .",
    "it is conceivable that one of two limitations in turner s code may be responsible for this quantitative difference between his simulation and ours : the lack of a photosphere and the inability to capture grid scale losses of kinetic energy . without performing additional simulations that separately reproduce each of these possibilities , we can not be certain as to the exact origin of the discrepancy .",
    "nevertheless , we suspect that lack of true energy conservation in turner s simulation is the primary cause .",
    "in the traditional @xmath0-model approach , whose logical underpinning is dimensional analysis , the stress , and therefore the magnetic field energy density , is scaled to the pressure . considered in a logically rigorous fashion , dimensional analysis suggests that two quantities with the same units are comparable in magnitude , but does not determine a causal relation between the two : that is , it does not tell us which quantity determines the other .",
    "nonetheless , if it is easier to estimate one than the other , it is easy to slip into the thought that the one harder to estimate follows the other , not just in scale , but in time . in this case",
    ", the @xmath0-model has often been imagined to suggest that the pressure controls the magnetic field .",
    "however , a crosscorrelation of the magnetic field energy against the radiation energy in this simulation shows that fluctuations in the magnetic field _ lead _ those in the radiation .",
    "if so , the dominant sense of causality must be the other way around ",
    "the magnetic field controls the radiation , not vice versa .",
    "in fact , that is the direction suggested by the dynamics : the mri causes field fluctuations to grow , deriving the needed energy from orbital shear ; nonlinear mode - mode interactions move power from long lengthscales to short ; short wavelength dissipative effects transfer energy from the magnetic field to heat in the plasma ; finally , electrons in the plasma radiate photons . in other words , intrinsic fluctuations in the magnetic turbulence",
    "can create a pressure - stress correlation even when there is no direct influence of the pressure on the saturation level of the magnetic field .",
    "all that is required is that their amplitude on timescales long compared to a thermal equilibration time are large enough , and these are already known to occur even in gas - dominated cases in which the pressure varies very little @xcite . when that is the case , the increased dissipation rate due to the stronger field leads to higher pressure , but not necessarily to any subsequent increase in the stress .",
    "thus , a key assumption of the argument for thermal instability in the radiation - dominated regime is undermined .",
    "using an approach reminiscent of the long - wavelength limit of the formalism developed in @xcite , the qualitative picture outlined above can be modelled by the following pair of equations : @xmath196 where @xmath197 are the box - integrated magnetic and radiation energies , @xmath198 are their equilibrium values , and @xmath199 is a random function with expectation value unity describing the intrinsic fluctuations in the scaling of magnetic energy density with pressure .",
    "we also suppose that the equilibrium magnetic energy density grows with pressure ( here the radiation energy ) with logarithmic derivative @xmath140 .",
    "thus , we allow for feedback in the sense that the pressure might be able to influence the stress .",
    "lastly , @xmath200 is the timescale for the magnetic energy to adjust toward its expectation value , @xmath201 is the timescale for magnetic dissipation , and @xmath137 is the radiation cooling time .",
    "the magnetic field energy matches the equilibrium value when @xmath202 , so these two timescales may be equated .",
    "non - dimensionalizing the energies in terms of their equilibrium values and the time in terms of @xmath201 , these equations become @xmath203 the timescale ratio @xmath204 may also depend on pressure ; we designate its logarithmic derivative with respect to pressure by @xmath205 ( the minus sign makes its definition consistent with the notation in @xcite ) .",
    "that assumption puts the model equations in the form : @xmath206 once again we can use the requirement that equilibrium values be consistent with zero time - dependence to constrain these parameters : this time we conclude that @xmath207 , leaving @xmath208 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , the timescale for the radiation energy to equilibrate is @xmath209 times the timescale on which the magnetic energy can fluctuate ; the magnetic energy must be dissipated many times over in order to produce a response in the radiation energy because @xmath210 is so large . for context , we recall that in the simulations described here , the mean @xmath211 while the mean thermal timescale was @xmath212  orbits .",
    "if this toy - model describes the simulations , i.e. , if heating in the simulations is primarily due to magnetic dissipation and cooling is due to radiation losses , these numbers would suggest that in the simulations @xmath201 should be defined as the ratio of box - integrated magnetic energy to magnetic dissipation rate , and its typical value should be @xmath213  orbits .",
    "in fact , consistent with this description of energy balance , the mean value of @xmath201 defined in this way was 0.53  orbits in simulation 1112a , and 0.55  orbits in simulation 1126b .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : energyhist ] , we show a sample solution of these equations , in this case with @xmath214 , @xmath215 , and initial conditions @xmath216 .",
    "note that setting @xmath217 means that there is _ no _ explicit dependence of magnetic amplification on the radiation pressure .",
    "the random function @xmath199 was constructed by requiring its power spectrum to match approximately the power spectrum of magnetic energy fluctuations seen in simulation 1112a ( i.e. , @xmath218 at frequencies @xmath219 and @xmath220 for @xmath221 ) , but choosing the phases of its fourier amplitudes randomly with uniform probability distribution in the interval @xmath222 . to make the comparision as direct as possible ,",
    "the duration of the integration was set to @xmath223 .",
    "just as in the simulations , the radiation energy fluctuates by factors of several over this timespan , but shows no clear trend .    guided by a traditional view of the @xmath0 model , one might object that the absence of thermal instability here is due to the lack of any explicit dependence of the magnetic energy on the radiation energy .",
    "however , closer study of the differential equations suggests that if @xmath137 is short compared to the timescale of the large - amplitude turbulence fluctuations , approximate radiative equilibrium is enforced on the shorter timescale .",
    "it would then follow that @xmath224 _ independent _ of @xmath140 .",
    "this is exactly what we see , for these parameters and all other combinations of @xmath140 and @xmath225 we have tried , subject only to the constraint that @xmath226 ( as discussed in @xcite , genuine instability can be found when this limit is violated ) . the flat power spectrum at frequencies below @xmath227 guarantees that there is substantial fluctuation power on timescales longer than the radiative equilibration timescale , and the result is as predicted , as shown by fig .",

    "a linear least - squares fit in the logarithms of these two quantities then yields a best - fit relation in which @xmath228 ; in the example shown , in which @xmath229 , the best - fit logarithmic derivative was 1.01 .",
    "thus , magnetic energy and pressure _ do _ scale together as suggested by the dimensional analysis underlying the @xmath0 model , but it is _ not _ necessarily because the pressure directly forces the magnetic energy ; it is instead the other way around : the pressure is the result of magnetic dissipative heating regulated by photon losses .",
    "we now see the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : emag_erad ] in a different light .",
    "although it is true that , compared at the same time , @xmath230 in that simulation , this correlation is created by the dependence of the radiation energy on the magnetic energy , and not by the radiation pressure regulating the magnetic field strength . moreover , if our simple model correctly describes the thermal balance , the slope of this correlation should be @xmath231 , so that @xmath232 .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath233 ; a logarithmic least - squares linear fit to the data of 1112a gives @xmath234 , supporting the toy - model .",
    "an important corollary of these results is that the intrinsic dependence of magnetic energy on radiation pressure parameterized by @xmath140 _ can not _ be inferred from the slope of the correlation between magnetic energy and radiation energy ; this slope is entirely independent of it .",
    "the most that one can do is to place an upper bound on how strongly pressure influences magnetic saturation by using the observed thermal stability to argue that @xmath235 .    to close this section",
    ", we make the qualitative remark that the sensitivity of the cooling time to pressure may influence the magnitude of fluctuations in the energy content .",
    "as argued in @xcite , provided @xmath201 is not too strong a function of box energy content , @xmath225 must be relatively large in magnitude and negative when gas pressure dominates radiation pressure because an increasing ratio of radiation to gas pressure makes diffusive cooling much more rapid .",
    "if so , the cooling time rapidly shortens when the radiation energy increases , placing a tight cap on fluctuations in the energy content of the box .",
    "when the radiation to gas pressure ratio is order unity or greater , the scaling of @xmath137 with total energy should be rather slower ( a prediction consistent with our results if @xmath201 is likewise not a strong function of @xmath236 ) . in this case",
    ", the cooling time is comparatively insensitive to energy content and exercises looser control on energy fluctuations , permitting the turbulence fluctuations to drive larger amplitude fluctuations in the total pressure .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of two simulations that each followed the evolution of a vertically - stratified shearing box with the same surface density and orbital frequency for @xmath237  orbits , or @xmath34  thermal times .",
    "the initial conditions of the two simulations differed only in being given different realizations of the small amplitude noise that was imposed on their otherwise smooth initial state . because the magneto - rotational instability generates mhd turbulence , these systems",
    "are chaotic ; differing small amplitude noise therefore leads to order unity contrasts in their subsequent evolution .",
    "the two simulations should thus be viewed as two different realizations of the many evolutions possible for these parameters .",
    "their qualitative aspects are , nonetheless , similar .    for example ,",
    "just as we have found in previous simulations studying shearing boxes with @xmath238 @xcite and @xmath145 @xcite , most of the disk mass is found near the midplane , where the magnetic field energy is @xmath239 times the combined gas and radiation pressure ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "likewise , in all cases the upper layers of the disk are magnetically - dominated , and the photosphere lies within this region . unlike the earlier simulations , in these two the box - averaged radiation pressure is @xmath1 times greater than the gas pressure at all times .",
    "most importantly , in both cases , the energy content of the box undergoes order unity fluctuations over timescales of many tens of orbits , but these fluctuations have no long - term trend .",
    "this result directly challenges the prediction made in @xcite that radiation pressure - dominated disk segments should be thermally unstable .",
    "note , however , that the prediction by @xcite of inflow instability in radiation - dominated disks remains to be investigated .    in our simulations ,",
    "the time - averaged dissipation rate in the disk body is roughly equal to the characteristic value @xmath240 , the rate at which diffusive radiation flux maintains hydrostatic balance @xcite .",
    "however , in some places ( @xmath241 ) , the local dissipation rate exceeds the characteristic value by more than @xmath242 .",
    "if this heat went into radiation flux , hydrostatic balance would be disrupted .",
    "we find that the excess is exactly compensated by radiative advection associated with an acoustic breathing mode . at the same time",
    ", mechanical work done on the fluid by the shearing boundaries in excess of the local dissipation rate is transported outward by poynting flux and radiation pressure work associated with the breathing mode . both the dissipated energy carried by radiation advection and ( non - dissipated ) energy carried by poynting flux and radiation pressure work are finally deposited and dissipated at @xmath243 , and from there all the way through the rest of the structure radiation diffusion overwhelms all other energy fluxes .    to explain the thermal stability of radiation - dominated disks",
    ", we argue that the comparability of stress and pressure inferred from dimensional analysis ( which underlies the @xmath0-model , and the prediction of instability ) is due to dissipation of magnetic turbulence ( which produces the stress ) providing the heat that is then transformed into radiation pressure .",
    "consequently , fluctuations in magnetic energy drive fluctuations in pressure , and not ( as has been commonly assumed ) the other way around .",
    "our claim is supported by two lines of evidence : first , crosscorrelation analysis of simulation data demonstrates that magnetic fluctuations _ lead _",
    "radiation energy fluctuations by 515 orbits , a little less than a thermal time .",
    "pressure fluctuations can not , then , drive magnetic fluctuations .",
    "second , we constructed a simple model realizing this picture , and this model reproduces two other important features observed in the simulation data : the system undergoes thermal fluctuations closely resembling in amplitude and timescale those seen in the simulations .",
    "in addition , although _ no _ correlation between magnetic energy and radiation pressure is built into the model , thermal balance automatically creates one after the fact .",
    "thus , correlations between stress and pressure are due to the dissipation of magnetic energy supplying thermal energy , not to the pressure defining a characteristic scale for the stress .",
    "a logical consequence of this point of view , in which stress determines pressure , rather than the other way around , is that the fundamental independent variables are surface density and orbital frequency . that the orbital frequency is independent of disk parameters is obvious , so long as the disk mass is small compared to the central mass .",
    "so long as the inflow timescale is long compared to the thermal timescale , the surface density must likewise be regarded as an independent parameter with respect to thermal and dynamical fluctuations .",
    "these two independent parameters , through the intertwined and nonlinear processes of mhd instability , tapping the energy reservoir of orbital shear , magnetic dissipation , thermal radiation , and radiative diffusion , with all of these taking place under conditions of vertical ( as well as radial ) gravitational confinement , combine to determine the magnetic field strength , both its mean saturation level and its fluctuations .",
    "orbital shear fixes the stress exerted by this field , while the turbulent cascade sets the dissipation rate .",
    "these two are not entirely separate , of course , as the time - averaged accretion rate is equivalent to either one .",
    "the pressure follows from the heating rate , as regulated by photon diffusion , and , in turn , closes the loop by determining the disk thickness .",
    "despite all these complications , at bottom , everything is still determined by only two variables , surface density and orbital frequency .",
