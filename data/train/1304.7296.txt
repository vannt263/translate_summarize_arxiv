    "a lattice simplex is _ unimodular _ if its normalized volume is  @xmath5 , that is , if its vertices are a lattice basis for @xmath13 .    in many contexts",
    "it is interesting to triangulate a given lattice polytope @xmath0 into unimodular simplices , that is , to construct a _",
    "unimodular triangulation _ of @xmath0 .",
    "this is not possible for all lattice simplices of dimension @xmath17 , but there is the following important result of knudsen , mumford and waterman  @xcite ( a proof appears also in @xcite ) :    [ thm : kmw ] for every lattice polytope @xmath0 there is a constant @xmath1 such that the dilation @xmath2 admits a unimodular triangulation",
    ".    the constant @xmath1 needed in the theorem can be arbitrarily large , as the following example shows :    [ exm : largek ] let @xmath18 be the standard @xmath19-simplex in @xmath20 , but consider it with respect to the lattice @xmath21 , so that @xmath14 has volume  @xmath6 .",
    "for any @xmath22 we have @xmath23 , which implies that @xmath24 contains no unimodular simplex with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , it does not have a unimodular triangulation .",
    "one question that is open , though , is whether a constant @xmath25 can be chosen that depends only on the dimension of  @xmath0 .",
    "the above example provides a lower bound @xmath26 for this constant , in case it exists . in this respect , kantor and sarkaria",
    "have shown the following .",
    "[ thm : ks ] for every @xmath27-dimensional lattice polytope @xmath0 the dilation @xmath28 admits a unimodular triangulation .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 has a unimodular triangulation does not automatically imply that @xmath29 has one for every @xmath30 .",

    "we show the following .",
    "[ thm : kp ] for every @xmath27-dimensional lattice polytope @xmath0 and every @xmath32 , @xmath2 has a unimodular triangulation .",
    "this result , as well as the one from  @xcite , is based on understanding _ empty _ lattice simplices in dimension 3 .",
    "a lattice simplex is called _ empty _ if the only lattice points it contains are its vertices .",
    "every unimodular simplex is empty , but the converse fails for empty simplices in all dimensions @xmath17 , as exemplified by @xmath33 ( which for @xmath34 yields an empty regular tetrahedron of normalized volume @xmath6 inscribed in the unit cube ) .",
    "a relation between empty and unimodular simplices comes from the following natural idea on how to triangulate @xmath2 .",
    "every lattice @xmath27-polytope @xmath0 can trivially be triangulated into empty tetrahedra , so @xmath2 can be triangulated into @xmath1-th dilations of empty tetrahedra .",
    "if , for a certain @xmath1 , we have that every @xmath1-th dilation of an empty tetrahedron has a unimodular triangulation , then @xmath2 has a decomposition into unimodular simplices that do not overlap one another .",
    "if , moreover , the triangulations of the individual dilated tetrahedra are made to agree in the facets they have in common , then we have a unimodular triangulation of @xmath2 . the simplest way to achieve this agreement of the individual triangulations",
    "is to make them _ standard on the boundary _ in the following sense :    [ defi : standard ] let @xmath35 be an empty lattice tetrahedron and let @xmath36 be a lattice triangulation of @xmath24 , for some @xmath1 .",
    "we say that @xmath36 is _ standard on the boundary _ if all the boundary edges in @xmath36 are parallel to edges of @xmath14 .",
    "this property uniquely defines the triangulation @xmath37 : each facet of @xmath36 is an empty ( hence unimodular ) triangle @xmath38 in a @xmath6-dimensional lattice , so that @xmath39 has a unique unimodular triangulation using only edges parallel to those of @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : standard ] ) .    .",
    "]    with this in mind we can now be more precise about the statements in this paper :    in section  [ sec : k=2 ] we establish a characterization of the empty tetrahedra @xmath14 for which @xmath40 admits a unimodular triangulation . for all of these",
    "the unimodular triangulation can be chosen to have standard boundary .",
    "this result appears also in  @xcite , but we repeat the proof since the techniques that appear in it will be useful later .    in section  [ sec : non - standard ] we show that @xmath24 has a unimodular triangulation for every empty tetrahedron @xmath14 and every @xmath41 . however , the triangulation we construct is not , in general , standard in the boundary .",
    "in section  [ sec : standard ] we extend kantor and sarkaria s technique to apply to @xmath24 for every composite @xmath1 ; that is , for every empty tetrahedron @xmath14 and every composite positive integer @xmath1 we construct a unimodular triangulation of @xmath24 with standard boundary .",
    "we also show that whenever @xmath42 and  @xmath43 have unimodular triangulations with standard boundary then so does @xmath44 .",
    "this implies theorem  [ thm : kp ] , except for the cases @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in section  [ sec : semi - standard ]",
    "we define the concept of triangulation with _ semi - standard boundary _ and show that @xmath24 has a unimodular triangulation with semi - standard boundary for every @xmath45 and every empty tetrahedron @xmath14 .",

    "some comments on the history of this paper are in order .",
    "the results in sections  [ sec : k=2 ] and  [ sec : non - standard ] were found by the second author in 1997 ( based on discussions with jeff lagarias ) during the special year on _ combinatorics _ at the mathematical sciences research institute ( berkeley , california ) .",
    "they were presented in several lectures ( in berkeley , new york , oberwolfach , and barcelona ) that year .",

    "the results of sections  [ sec : standard ] and  [ sec : semi - standard ] were found by the first author in 2009 during the workshops _ combinatorial challenges in toric varieties _",

    "we thank the three institutions and the organizers of these events for their support and the excellent scientific environments they provided .",
    "for any polytope @xmath46 and a linear functional @xmath47 , the _ width _ of  @xmath0 with respect to @xmath48 is the difference between the maximum and minimum values taken by @xmath48 on @xmath0 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a lattice polytope we are interested in @xmath48 belonging to the dual lattice , in which case the width of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath48 is an integer .",
    "thus , if we speak of width in the following , we always refer to _ lattice width _ , which is the minimal width of the lattice polytope with respect to any non - constant dual lattice functional .",
    "all the results in this paper use the classification of @xmath27-dimensional empty simplices by white @xcite .",
    "but , more than that , they use in an essential way the property that every empty lattice @xmath27-simplex has width one ( from which the classification is easy to derive , as we show below ) .    for any full - dimensional lattice polytope",
    "@xmath0 the minimum possible width is  @xmath5 , which occurs if and only if all the vertices of @xmath0 lie in two consecutive @xmath48-constant lattice hyperplanes .",
    "in fact , we can also speak about the _ width with respect to a lattice hyperplane @xmath49 _ , by which we mean width with respect to the unique ( modulo sign ) primitive linear functional that is constant on  @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the following theorem speaks of width of a tetrahedron with respect to two opposite edges , meaning `` with respect to the unique primitive functional that is constant on both edges .",
    "'' the theorem does not extend to higher dimensions .",
    "for example , seb  @xcite has shown that in all dimensions @xmath50 there are empty simplices that have width at least @xmath51 with respect to any lattice hyperplane .",
    "[ thm : width - one ] every empty lattice tetrahedron has width one with respect to ( at least ) one of its three pairs of opposite edges .",
    "this has the following interpretation , which is implicitly used in what follows : consider @xmath52 tiled by translated copies of a tetrahedron and an octahedron , in the natural way ( this is , for example , the delaunay tiling of the face centered cubic lattice ) . let @xmath13 be a lattice that contains the vertices of this tiling .",
    "theorem  [ thm : width - one ] says that if the tetrahedra are empty with respect to @xmath13 then the lattice points in each octahedron @xmath0 lie all ( except of course for two of the vertices ) in one of the three quadrilaterals formed with the vertices of @xmath0 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : width - one ] and the corollary below were first proved by white in 1964 @xcite , although scarf  @xcite attributes it to howe ( unpublished ) .",
    "a proof , and an extension , can also be found in  @xcite .",
    "the tetrahedra that appear in the classification had been previously constructed by reeve  @xcite .",

    "also , since the edge @xmath62 is primitive , we can assume @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "now , every integer translation of the plane @xmath65 extends to a unimodular isomorphism that restricts to the identity on @xmath64 .",

    "that @xmath58 is necessary and sufficient for @xmath57 is easy to show .    if we extend the family of canonical tetrahedra to include @xmath76 ( which is unimodular ) , the corollary gives a full set of representatives for the empty lattices @xmath27-simplices modulo unimodular equivalence .",
