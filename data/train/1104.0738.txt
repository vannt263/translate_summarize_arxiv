    "a similar construction can be extended to non - linear sigma models on symmetric spaces where it is again possible to construct an infinite number of non - local charges which realize a yangian .",
    "an important point to note here is that a flat conserved current exists always from which an infinite number of non - local charges can be generated , for example by following the treatment in  @xcite . since ads spaces and round spheres are symmetric spaces , the same argument can be used in the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite as pointed out in  @xcite and extensively discussed in  @xcite , where a list of symmetric spaces with potential ads / cft application is given .    while the symmetric cases have been studied intensively and are well understood , finding hidden infinite - dimensional symmetries for non - symmetric cosets is still an open problem .",
