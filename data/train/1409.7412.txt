    "recent experimental progress in measuring improved upper limits for the electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite has focussed attention on the non - spherical shape of the electron .",
    "these new limits have been interpreted in terms of the deviation of the shape of the electron from spherical symmetry .",
    "a non - zero dipole moment arises from forces that violate parity and time reversal invariance , and its measurement at a much larger value than the standard model prediction would represent new physics .",
    "however , a non - spherical shape of the electron arises naturally within the standard model via the standard effects of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . in particular , the electron fluctuates into a virtual photon and virtual electron , giving the electron both a non - zero spatial extent and a non - spherical shape .",
    "these density fluctuations are of first - order in the fine structure constant , @xmath0 . a schematic representation of the wave function of the electron is given by |e=|e_b+|e_b , where @xmath1 .",
    "we shall refer to the state @xmath2 as the physical electron and the electron in the @xmath3 component as a virtual electron .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate the structure of the electron within qed .",
    "quantities such as the extent of the electron and its orbital angular momentum can only be described within field theory if the light - front or infinite momentum frame approach is used  @xcite , and we will use that approach here .",
    "the effects of pair - production from the vacuum are eliminated in this approach , allowing one to use fock - space expansions of wave functions . in the light front approach the longitudinal and transverse momenta of the constituents",
    "are treated differently , with the longitudinal expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath4 with @xmath5 of the constituent plus - component of the momentum to the total plus component of the momentum , and the transverse momentum @xmath6 allowed all real values .",
    "thus one refers to roundness as azimuthal symmetry or dependence only on @xmath7 .",
    "the use of the spin degree of freedom is needed to perceive a lack of roundness , see for example  @xcite .",
    "the light - front formalism has been extensively and successfully applied to understand the structure of the proton , and a variety of formal tools have been developed .",
    "these tools include transverse charge distributions@xcite , generalized parton distributions @xcite-@xcite transverse momentum distributions @xcite-@xcite , and wigner distributions  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is our intention to use these very same tools to elucidate the structure of the electron .",
    "this approach has already been used in  @xcite to provide a qualitative explanation of the sign of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and also in  @xcite to study the angular momentum content .",
    "a secondary purpose of this paper is use the advantages of knowing the wave function to provide insights useful for constructing models of the nucleon wave function .",
    "the @xmath8 component of the electron is analogous to a quark - vector - diquark component of the nucleon",
    "@xcite used this analogy to model nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the lowest - order , two - component formulation of the electron has been used for a long time  @xcite , but one detail is added here .",
    "it is standard procedure to let the virtual photon have a mass ( here , @xmath9 ) to handle the infrared regularization , with the specific value of this mass depending on experimental conditions  @xcite , or the atomic conditions for a bound state  @xcite . in particular , for an electron bound in an atom @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the election mass  @xcite and @xmath12 is the rydberg constant . for a free electron ,",
    "the value of @xmath9 is determined by the energy resolution  @xcite , for which we take @xmath13 as a typical value .",
    "it is worthwhile to explain how it is that the photon mass ends up being replaced by the energy resolution .",
    "peskin & schroeder  @xcite show , for on - shell ( free ) electrons , that @xmath14 is infrared ( ir ) divergent unless the virtual photon has a mass and the resulting elastic electron - target cross section contains this regulated ir divergence . but",
    "the measured cross section is the sum of the elastic and brehmstrahlung cross sections , and the ir divergence is removed when the sum is taken .",
    "the summed cross section is ir safe but depends on the experimental resolution .",
    "the net result is that the correct answer is is obtained by using the computed value of @xmath15 with the photon mass replaced with the energy resolution .",
    "modern experimental facilities have excellent energy resolution ( see for example  @xcite ) so we use the value of the electron mass , 0.51 mev , which is very small , as the energy resolution .",
    "we shall see that for any values of @xmath16 , that there is very little variation with @xmath9 , so taking @xmath13 is a reasonable simplification .",
    "the lamb shift has been interpreted as arising from an increase in the spatial extent of the bound electron relative to the free one  @xcite .",
    "this means that there could be substantial differences between the structure of a bound electron with @xmath17 and a free one with @xmath13 .",
    "the difference in structure between bound and free nucleons is the cause of the emc effect  @xcite .",
    "thus the electron , with its known wave function has interesting properties that can lend insight into nucleon properties , and exploring the dependence of the various electron structure metrics on @xmath9 is an essential part of this paper .",
    "the remainder of the paper follows the outline : sect .",
    "ii is concerned with a brief review of the light - front tools discussed above . then our treatment of the electron wave function is described in sect .",

    "<S> the shape of the electron is studied using lowest - order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> quantities used to probe the structure of the proton : form factors , generalized parton distributions , transverse densities , wigner distributions and the angular momentum content are computed for the electron - photon component of the electron wave function . the influence of longitudinally polarized photons , demanded by the need for infrared regularization via a non - zero photon mass , is included . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate value of the photon mass depends on experimental conditions , and consequently the size of the electron ( as defined by the slope of its dirac form factor ) bound in a hydrogen atom is found to be about four times larger than when the electron is free . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the electron , as determined from the transverse density and generalized parton distributions is shown to not be round , and the free electron is shown to be far less round than the bound electron . an electron distribution function ( analogous to the quark distribution function ) is defined , and that of the bound electron is shown to be suppressed compared to that of the free electron . </S>",
    "<S> if the relative transverse momentum of the virtual electron and photon is large compared with the electron mass , the virtual electron and photon each carry nearly the total angular momentum of the physical electron ( 1/2 ) , with the orbital angular momentum being nearly ( -1/2 ) . including the non - zero photon mass leads to the suppression of end - point contributions to form factors . </S>",
    "<S> implications for proton structure and color transparency are discussed . </S>"
