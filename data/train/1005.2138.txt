    "@xmath0-hypernuclear production in @xmath6 reactions , in which the final state is uniquely identified by measuring the outgoing pion momentum , was reported for the first time in stopped @xmath1 experiments at cern in 1973 @xcite and more recently in experiments at kek @xcite , bnl @xcite and at da@xmath7ne , frascati , by the finuda collaboration @xcite . on the theoretical side , several distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) calculations of @xmath6 hypernuclear production rates",
    "have been reported  @xcite , but none of them led to satisfactory agreement with the measured rates . in general , these calculated capture rates fall below the experimentally reported rates , with the exception of the old cern data for @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "we study the reaction @xmath16 in which a @xmath17 meson is captured on a target nucleus denoted as @xmath4 in its ground state @xmath18 , from an atomic orbit @xmath19 into a final state @xmath20 of a @xmath0 hypernucleus @xmath21 plus an outgoing pion .",
    "the superscript @xmath22 denotes the pion charge ( @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively ) .",

    "the pion dw @xmath38 in the final state is given in terms of a partial - wave expansion : @xmath39 the radial wave function @xmath40 , which reduces to the spherical bessel function @xmath41 for a free pion , solves the klein - gordon equation with the pion - nuclear optical potential , plus the appropriate electromagnetic potential for a charged pion .",

    "the momentum @xmath46 of the outgoing pion is determined by energy conservation , and @xmath47 stands for the reduced energy in the final state , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 are appropriately averaged in - medium quantities .",

    "( [ eq : r / y])-([eq : il ] ) assume that the dwia capture rate calculation does not depend on the total angular momenta @xmath67 for the orbits in question .",

    "in this section , we specify the entities that are needed to perform numerical calculations of nuclear capture rates .",
    "first , we outline the model used for the one - baryon capture process eq .",
    "( [ reakce1nukl ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : il ] ) that serve as input to nuclear capture rate calculations .       as a function of the nuclear density for capture on neutrons ( solid curve ) and on protons ( dashed curve ) . ]    for the calculation of brs @xmath43 of the one - baryon capture process eq .",
    "( [ reakce1nukl ] ) , we adopted the effective potential model based on chiral symmetry , as described in detail in refs .",
    "the required brs are obtained in coupled - channel calculations that include ten meson - baryon channels coupled to the @xmath70 system @xcite .",
    "we also take the effects of pauli blocking and kaon self - energy in the nuclear medium into account @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the calculated brs on the nuclear density is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figbrratios ] as a function of the fractional nuclear density @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is nuclear - matter density .",
    "although the central nuclear density varies along the periodic table roughly in the range @xmath73 , the brs shown in the figure do not change much over this range of densities .",
    "therefore , the precise dependence on @xmath74 may be neglected , and we assume that the @xmath69 capture reaction takes place at a proton ( or neutron ) density @xmath75 . for further applications ,",
    "we denote the brs obtained at nuclear density @xmath75 by br1 , and the brs obtained in vacuum by br2 .",
    "the use of a microscopic model for the @xmath69 brs is one of the novelties of the present paper .",
    "past works used brs derived indirectly by extrapolating from measurements performed in carbon and freon emulsions @xcite , a procedure that is prone to systematic errors .",
    "we use these emulsion brs ( labeled here as br3 ) to compare with brs obtained from our microscopic chiral model .",
    "this is shown in table  [ tabbrratios ] , where the maximum difference between the various brs ( br1 , br2 , and br3 ) is as large as @xmath76 .",
    "however , this variation is still small compared to other effects discussed below .",
    "the ratio of 1/2 for brs on a proton to brs on a neutron follows from charge independence , which is implemented by conserving isospin in our model for @xmath69 .    .@xmath77 branching ratios ( in units of @xmath78 ) .",

    "( [ eq : r / y ] ) ] are presented in table  [ tabcaprates1p ] for @xmath8 and @xmath83 targets . for completeness",
    ", we also included the @xmath84 @xmath85 transition discussed in sec .  iv b1 and added experimental rates from kek @xcite and bnl @xcite . here , the reason for choosing kek over cern @xcite and finuda @xcite is that for @xmath11 production , the kek @xcite rates are the closest to the isospin factor 2 expected in getting these rates from the @xmath86 rates which were measured only at bnl @xcite .",
    "capture rate in @xmath11 varies from @xmath87 @xcite to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "] of course , if further ( @xmath89 ) experiments are done on @xmath8 , which would lead to different results from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , one s preference might change accordingly .",
    "capture rate to @xmath11 over that of @xmath86 is largely caused by the ratio of the @xmath90 brs which in the limit of good isospin is 2 . a slight departure from this ratio",
    "is caused by charge - dependent effects in our calculation , notably from the outgoing pion dws .",
    "] similar to the summed @xmath5 rate discussed in sec .",
    "iv b1 , the summed @xmath79 rate for the deep potential [ @xmath91 is smaller by a factor @xmath92 than for the relatively shallow potential [ @xmath93 . excluding the old cern data @xcite , the calculated @xmath79 capture rates are generally smaller than the experimentally reported rates , with the exception that the [ @xmath93 rates for @xmath86 are larger than the reported rate @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath79 spectral strength is partly mixed into the ( @xmath94 ) quasifree continuum , and its extraction from the measured spectra is considerably more ambiguous than the extraction of the summed @xmath5 production rate , we do not proceed further to confront theory with experiment for the summed @xmath79 production rate .",
    "we performed dwia ( @xmath94 ) calculations for @xmath2-shell targets , using several @xmath1 and pion wave functions to test the sensitivity of the calculated hypernuclear capture rates to the choice of these wave functions .",
    "the calculated capure rates are generally smaller than the measured ones ; the deeper the @xmath1 potential , the smaller is the capture rate . since the absolute normalization of capture at rest experimental rates is a delicate matter , we suggest to focus on the @xmath4 dependence of the measured rates , expecting it to be largely free of the absolute normalization of the data .",
    "the calculated capture rates for a given @xmath1 optical potential decrease as a function of @xmath4 , with the fractional difference between the rates calculated for the two extreme @xmath1 optical potentials , the shallow [ @xmath93 and the deep [ @xmath91 , increasing steadily with @xmath4 .",
    "we find other dependencies of the calculated capture rates to be secondary to the dependence on the @xmath1-atomic wave function in the range studied here .",
    "we argue that a dedicated experimental study of @xmath5 capture rates in @xmath2-shell targets , such as reported recently by the finuda collaboration in a preliminary form @xcite , could yield useful information on the depth of the threshold @xmath1 optical potential by comparing the measured @xmath4 dependence with the @xmath4 dependence of the calculated capture rates listed in table  [ tabcaprates1s ] .",
