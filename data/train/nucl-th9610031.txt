    "much recent attention has been focused on the question how the mass of the light pseudoscalar mesons ( pions and kaons ) change in nuclear matter with increasing baryon density . in the case of pions ,",
    "the answer was obvious for a long time .",
    "in symmetric nuclear matter to leading order in the density @xmath2 the pion mass shift is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the isospin - even @xmath5 scattering length . a chiral low - energy theorem as well as",
    "@xmath5 data imply that this @xmath4 is very small .",
    "effects of nuclear correlations are therefore important .",
    "a useful and successful method to treat such correlations is the effective field approach of ericson and ericson @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this approach is that repulsive two - body correlations between any pair of nucleons in the medium reduce the pion field at the position of each scatterer .",
    "consequently @xmath4 is replaced by a ( negative ) effective scattering length @xmath6 .",
    "its repulsive effect leads to a moderate upward shift of the pion mass ( by about 10% at @xmath7 , the density of normal nuclear matter ) .",
    "this s - wave repulsion has been verified for many years in pion - nuclear physics ( see for example ref .",
    "an impressive confirmation has come very recently through the discovery of deeply bound pion - nuclear states @xcite .    for kaons ,",
    "the systematic exploration of in - medium masses has progressed recently on the basis of the chiral su(3 ) effective lagrangian @xcite . here",
    "the driving s - wave interactions are much stronger than those in the @xmath8 system . to leading order in the kaon energy @xmath9 ( or mass @xmath10 ) the driving born terms of the threshold @xmath11 and @xmath12 scattering matrix derived from the chiral meson - baryon lagrangian are    @xmath13    where @xmath14 mev is the pseudoscalar decay constant . these ( tomozawa - weinberg , or tw ) terms come from vector current interactions",
    ". they are therefore repulsive for @xmath11 and attractive for @xmath12 channels .",
    "scalar interactions , attractive in both channels , enter in next - to - leading order .",
    "they are proportional to the large kaon - nucleon sigma term @xmath15 of order @xmath16 , but compete with repulsive @xmath17-terms of similar magnitude .    based on these driving terms , in - medium calculations of kaon self energies",
    "have been performed using either chiral perturbation theory @xcite , or chiral su(3 ) dynamics @xcite in a non - perturbative coupled channels scheme @xcite . in the latter calculation the @xmath18 is generated explicitly as a @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) quasibound state which quickly dissolves , however , in nuclear matter and is thus of no relevance at higher density .",
    "the primary effect in both types of calculations is a splitting of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 masses in medium , a tendency which is indeed already suggested by the tw born terms ( 1 ) .    the results of refs .",
    "@xcite include pauli blocking which turns out to be the dominant medium effect ( corrections from nucleon binding and fermi motion are shown to be small @xcite ) . on the other hand , short - range nucleon - nucleon correlations",
    "were also suggested to be important @xcite and should therefore be incorporated .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study effects of nn correlations on kaon masses together with pauli corrections using the effective field method of ref .",
    "the formalism which is needed to adapt this method to the kaon - nuclear case is presented in section 2 .",
    "since pauli corrections have already been evaluated @xcite solving a coupled channel lippmann - schwinger equation in medium , we can test the accuracy of the effective field method at that level ( section 3 ) and then continue to include short - range nn correlations ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss the relation between this approach and four - fermi contact terms of the chiral effective lagrangian used in chiral perturbation theory , and then close with concluding remarks .",
    "here we apply the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to the s - wave kaon interaction in nuclear matter . in spite of the similar nature of the kaon and the pion we want to give a short review of the arguments which led ericson and ericson to their famous optical potential .",
    "the reasons are the following :    1 .   the kaons have a different isospin structure .",
    "the charge exchange channels were not included in their first work and only to second order in the later works ( to our knowledge ) , whereas we need to iterate those channels to all orders for our purposes .",
    "the pauli principle plays an important role in @xmath23-p scattering inside nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "therefore it has to be included to all orders in the optical potential .    the starting point of ref .",
    "@xcite is the observation that the meson field @xmath24 produced by an incident meson wave @xmath25 on a system of ( static ) nucleons is the sum of this incident wave and the scattered waves from all the individual nucleons .",
    "the scattered wave is simply the effective meson field @xmath26 at the ( fixed ) scatterer @xmath27 times the scattering amplitude @xmath28 times a spherical outgoing wave .",
    "thus , @xmath29 here @xmath9 and @xmath30 denote the energy and momentum of the meson , and @xmath31 with the meson rest mass @xmath32 .",
    "we have suppressed a phase @xmath33 , because we are only interested in stationary solutions .",
    "let us now identify the meson with a kaon . to include the charge - exchange channels of the kaon - nucleon system we recall that the scattering amplitude at scatterer @xmath27 has the following isospin structure : @xmath34 where @xmath35 projects on kaon - nucleon states of definite isospin i. with the ( pauli ) isospin - matrices of the ith scatterer ( nucleon ) @xmath36 and kaon @xmath37 they are given as : @xmath38    in a homogeneous medium all effective fields @xmath39 at scatterers @xmath27 with the same isospin quantum numbers are the same : @xmath40 can therefore be written as @xmath41 , dropping the explicit reference to nucleon @xmath27 .",

    "( [ phi_eff_1 ] ) can then be replaced by its value at @xmath55 . in the case of nuclear matter",

    "note that @xmath59 is symmetric in @xmath62 and does not depend on @xmath55 because of translation invariance , so we can always set @xmath63 .",

    "we obtain : @xmath65 with the self - energy , or optical potential , @xmath66 this is the generalized s - wave optical potential of ericson and ericson .",

    "the corresponding ( off - shell ) s - wave scattering amplitudes are expressed in terms of the energy dependent ( off - shell ) scattering lengths @xmath75 .",
    "their threshold values @xmath76 coincide with the physical scattering lengths . in the sector with strangeness @xmath77 : @xmath78 analogous relations hold in the @xmath79 sector with the @xmath80 scattering lengths : @xmath81    in order to calculate the off - shell scattering lengths we use the coupled channels approach of ref .",
    "@xcite which is based on chiral dynamics and describes all available low - energy kaon - nucleon data together with photoproduction channels .",
    "note that the energy of a @xmath22 in matter is generally complex , its imaginary part being related to processes in which @xmath19 decays into pion - hyperon channels .",
    "but as we will see , this imaginary part is always small compared with the real part .",

    "@xcite where these effects have been treated by solving an in - medium coupled channels lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the agreement between the present effective field approach and the previous full coupled - channels result is quite remarkable , especially in view of the fact that the lippmann - schwinger coupled channels calculation does _ not _ make use of the fixed scatterer approximation .",
    "the pauli exchange correlations discussed in the previous section give an impression of the long - range part of the nucleon - nucleon pair correlation function . as a next step we study the influence of short - range repulsive nn correlations . to start with ,",
    "consider a schematic hard core .",
    "assume that the two - particle density ( [ twodensy ] ) vanishes at distances smaller than @xmath138 and that the pair correlation function is therefore simply @xmath139 independent of spin and isospin .",
    "it is instructive to compare this with the pauli pair correlation functions ( [ cori ] ) at zero distance ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "for example , in the symmetric nuclear matter case they are : @xmath141 therefore the main contributions of the short - range correlations to the pair correlation functions are in the sectors @xmath142 . in the sector @xmath143",
    "the pauli principle already prevents the two nucleons to come close to each other , so the repulsive core is nearly inactive .    for distances larger than @xmath138",
    "we assume that the pair correlation function is completely described by pauli exchange effects . in this simple model the correlation parameter @xmath59",
    "is given by :    @xmath144    for symmetric nuclear matter and by @xmath145    for @xmath21 in neutron matter ( for the @xmath22 in neutron matter , multiply @xmath146 by @xmath147 ) . here the function @xmath148\\ ] ] describes the short - range correlations ( [ shortrange ] ) .",
    "later we will discuss a different parameterization of the short - range part , one which approximates the realistic g - matrix derived from brueckner hartree fock calculations .    inserting the correlation parameters ( [ corl2],b ) into the optical potential ( [ uopt ] ) , the resulting solutions of the kaon dispersion relations ( [ real_disp],[imag_disp ] )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( symmetric nuclear matter ) and in fig .  4",
    "( neutron matter ) . for comparison",
    "we show in these figures also the effective kaon masses calculated in the previous section with pauli blocking only ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "the effect of the short - range correlations starts out small at low densities , becoming sizeable only at densities larger than normal nuclear matter density , @xmath150 .",
    "the short - range correlations increase both kaon and antikaon masses as compared with the results including pauli blocking only .",
    "a better parameterization of the pair correlation function in symmetric nuclear matter is given in @xcite . there",
    "the short - range part is chosen to approximate the brueckner g - matrix and found to be quite well described by a spherical bessel function : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the mass of the @xmath9-meson . to incorporate the pauli part of the pair correlation function ( [ cori ] ) we assume that these two correlations contribute multiplicatively in the two - particle density : @xmath153\\left[1 + { c_{\\mathrm i , i'}}^{\\mathrm sr}(|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'| )     \\right].\\ ] ]",
    "therefore the full pair correlation function is @xmath154 in this model .",
    "the effective kaon masses , calculated with these pair correlation functions , are also shown in fig .  3 and differ only marginally from the ones calculated with the simpler ansatz ( [ shortrange ] ) .",
    "while the repulsive effect of short range correlations is moderate , we expect that it will be important for the issue of kaon condensation in neutron stars unless certain nonperturbative effects discussed below ( which are not included in the present treatment ) bring large corrections .",
    "kaon condensation can occur once the effective kaon mass gets equal to or smaller than the electron chemical potential @xcite . without the short - range correlations this matching will occur around @xmath155 if one uses the electron chemical potential employed in @xcite . with the inclusion of the short - range correlations this matching will be shifted to higher density @xmath156 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) or if hyperons are present in the dense matter as suggested in some recent papers @xcite , may not even take place . in the latter case ,",
    "the electron chemical potential can drop at densities @xmath157@xmath158 due to the appearance of @xmath159 and @xmath160hyperons in the neutron star matter .",
    "this matter is currently under debate and deserves to be clarified .",
    "we shall now compare the present calculation which , as we should stress , is very tightly constrained @xcite by the full ensemble of kaon - nucleon data , to the chiral perturbation calculation of lee et al . @xcite and the mean - field treatment of @xcite , both of which are less constrained by on - shell data .",
    "some features between them overlap and some do not .",
    "understanding the similarities and differences between these approaches will be crucial in confronting data on the properties of kaons in dense matter coming from extrapolations of kaonic atom data as well as the gsi experiments of the kaos and fopi collaborations currently in progress .",
    "it will also be important for establishing whether or not kaons can condense at low enough density as to be relevant to  nuclear star \" matter @xcite .    to streamline the discussion ,",
    "we first recall the key ingredients of the present treatment and of ref .  @xcite . in the present paper ( call it a ) , the potential for kaon - nuclear interactions is constructed with  irreducible graphs \" calculated to @xmath161 in chiral perturbation theory and then inserted as the kernel into the lippmann - schwinger equation for both free - space and in - medium kaon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the solution of the integral equation correctly accounts for the infrared singular",
    " reducible \" graphs to _ all _ orders of the chiral expansion in a way consistent with the general strategy of chiral perturbation theory in the presence of bound states or resonances .",
    "pauli correlations are readily taken into account at the level of solving the lippmann - schwinger equation or as , in this paper , in the effective field method . while these two approaches are found to give the same result",
    ", the latter has the advantage that the short - range correlations can also be simply implemented .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the in - medium kaon - nuclear interaction is treated to one - loop order ( or @xmath0 ) with the quasi - bound @xmath162 introduced as a local interpolating field . while the @xmath162 as an elementary local field may not be accurate enough for @xmath23-proton scattering near threshold , it can however be an adequate way of introducing the @xmath162 degree of freedom for in - medium physics ( a discussion on this point is found in @xcite where a chiral expansion to @xmath161 is made . to be more predictive , one would have to do an @xmath0 calculation which is not feasible at the moment ) .",
    "to the chiral order considered , the @xmath162 can contribute in two ways : one , in the off - shell elementary kaon - nucleon scattering amplitude and two , in an effective four - fermi interaction involving both nucleon and @xmath162 . in this approach ( that we shall refer to as b ) , a certain class of two - body correlations including pauli - principle effects are included but the short - range correlations calculated in a are not .",
    "let us now compare quantitatively the two ( a and b ) approaches . for in - medium @xmath163 properties ,",
    "the results are quite similar : the effective kaon mass @xmath164 scales in density at about the same rate up to the normal matter density and increases somewhat more rapidly in a than in b. the reason for this similarity is simple : since the @xmath162 does not figure importantly in this channel , its ramifications in a ( i.e. , the proper treatment of the binding mechanism of the @xmath162 ) and in b ( i.e. , the four - fermi interaction involving @xmath162 ) are unimportant .",
    "the situation with @xmath23-nuclear interaction is , however , considerably different .",
    "this is more pronounced in symmetric nuclear matter than neutron matter .",
    "the approach a in symmetric nuclear matter predicts a decrease in the @xmath23 mass ( or equivalently the attraction in the kaon - nuclear potential ) of about 120 mev whereas in the approach b , the attraction is sizeable greater , say , about 200 mev .",
    "this large attraction in b is obtained by fixing by fiat a parameter associated with four - fermi interactions involving the @xmath162 to agree with the attraction suggested by friedman , gal and batty @xcite from their analysis of kaonic atoms .",
    "it is _ not _ a prediction of the theory .",
    "the resulting attraction at densities greater than that of nuclear matter found in b is thus simply explained by this additional term .",
    "the four - fermi interaction in question corresponds to an @xmath0 irreducible graph in the chiral expansion and is not included in the approach a. one can think of the short - range correlations calculated in a as a four - fermi interaction involving nucleons only , but in a naive chiral counting it would appear at @xmath165 . since in b _ not _ all the four - fermi interaction terms that can contribute are included , the additional attraction in b over and above that accounted in a can be thought of as the net effect of the irreducible @xmath0 terms not taken into account in a. that it is an additional attraction is a consequence of the fitting . as such",
    ", it will be subject to further empirical constraints .",
    "the mean - field approach of @xcite exploits the fact that in medium , the @xmath162 plays an insignificant role ( due to the dissociation of the @xmath162 in the approach a or due to a weak coupling of the @xmath162 with no kinematic enhancement near threshold in the approach b ) . as such",
    ", this approach is not constrained by the on - shell kaon - nucleon data as in the cases of a and b. limiting to the @xmath161 chiral order and ignoring the role of the @xmath162 , all dominant in - medium higher - order correlation effects ( particularly , the many - fermi interactions in the scalar channel ) are then subsumed into the scaling of the effective pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath166 .. thus higher - n fermi interactions are generally suppressed .",
    "there is , however , _",
    "one possible exception _ : when the interaction is mediated by a scalar meson , then the corresponding n - fermi interactions can give a coherent effect when the effective mass of the scalar meson becomes light as it is expected to happen in dense matter ( or hot matter near the chiral phase transition ) .",
    "such a scalar - induced higher - fermi interaction then acts like a scalar tadpole on hadrons and can give rise to a decreasing hadron mass or equivalently to the @xmath166 @xcite .",
    "] this leads to an effective constituent quark  or mean - field  counting that predicts that the effective scalar and vector potentials in kaon - nuclear interactions ",
    "the kaon containing only one valence chiral quark  are 1/3 of the corresponding nucleon - nuclear interactions that involve three light quarks .",
    "this description which correctly accounts for the nucleon mean field in nuclear matter provides a simple explanation for the large ( @xmath167 mev ) attraction for kaonic atoms of ref.@xcite and seems to be consistent with the ( preliminary ) kaos and fopi data of kaon properties in dense nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "whether or not such an additional higher order chiral contribution with a net attraction is unambiguously needed for understanding in - medium kaon properties should be settled by careful analyses of the ongoing experiments on kaons in dense medium .",
    "these experiments will also provide a crucial constraint on the role of kaons in neutron - rich medium and determine in particular whether kaon condensation does actually figure in the structure of compact stars .",
    "if such an attraction is established , it would help in going beyond the present treatment in a systematic chiral perturbation calculation that can account _ simultaneously _ for kaon - nucleon and kaon - nuclear interactions .",
