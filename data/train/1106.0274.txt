    "before turning to radiation theory we add a comprehensive account of relevant simultaneous field and particle observations .",
    "figure [ fig - over ] gives an overview of a fast spacecraft passage through the auroral kilometric radiation source region .",
    "such data have been shown earlier ( for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and others ) .",
    "the data are exhaustively described in the caption .",
    "the top panel shows the magnetic field of the typical sheet current profile across the extended upward current carried by the downward several - kev electrons ( fifth panel ) with angular horseshoe distribution ( sixth panel ) .",
    "the horseshoe is characterised by lacking electrons at pitch angles @xmath3 in the loss cone and maximum electron fluxes around 0@xmath4 and 360@xmath4 .",
    "the energy spread of the auroral electron distribution , i.e. the horseshoe electron temperature , is not much less than the average electron energy .",
    "the second to fourth panels show spectral wave observations : highly fluctuating total electric wave amplitudes in panel two reaching up to 1 v / m , which are related to the broadband low - frequency emissions in panel three and being typical for the signatures of a large number of electron holes along the path of the spacecraft ; these emissions are overlaid by equally spaced ion - cyclotron harmonics which coincide with ion conics in the two lowest panels showing the ion flux .",
    "these are of little interest here .",
    "the fourth panel shows the overview of the auroral kilometric radiation at and above the electron cyclotron frequency @xmath5 , the black horizontal line at @xmath6360 khz .",
    "three electron cyclotron - harmonic bands are covered .",
    "one notices the well - known extension of the radiation below the electron cyclotron frequency in the entire radiation source region .",
    "here we just summarise some relevant facts in panels 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 from top :     panel 5 in the kilometric radiation source ( roughly between 10 and 60 s ) shows the electron energy flux forming an intense band in the kev range with energy spread less but comparable to central electron energy .",
    " panel 6 shows the angular distribution of these fluxes to concentrate around 0@xmath4 and 360@xmath4 but spreading in angle with broad completely empty loss cone around 160@xmath4 to 200@xmath4 .",
    "note the steep decrease of the fluxes with increasing angle .",
    "such spectra are typical for horseshoe - ring distributions .",
    " panel 2 shows electric wave forms reaching large amplitudes up to low - frequency electric wave fields of @xmath7 to @xmath8 v / m being strongly modulated not only by spacecraft spin ( the 4 s modulation ) but predominantly intrinsically .",
    " panel 3 shows the corresponding low frequency wave spectrogram exhibiting very broad band temporarily highly variable signals with frequency far exceeding the plasma frequency .",
    "electron densities ( not shown ) range here , in the ` auroral cavity ' , around 0.05 @xmath9 yielding plasma frequencies @xmath10 2 khz .",
    "the horizontal black line at few 100 hz is the ion - cyclotron frequency .",
    " such wave spectra correspond to the spacecraft crossing many closely spaced narrow electric wave structures with steep boundaries . they belong to electron holes ( cf .",
    "* for the proof of the existence of electron holes in the auroral kilometric radiation source ) .",
    " one may note that these spectra also show signs of equally spaced ion cyclotron harmonics which are the result of the known instability of electron holes ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with respect to these waves .",
    "a six second snapshot of free space high frequency ( @xmath11 ) electromagnetic wave spectra taken from the same spacecraft orbit and time - slot accidentally caught by the fast tracker instrumentation is reproduced in the highest available temporal and frequency resolution in figure [ fig - rad ] ( one should note that resolution is limited by the ` fourier uncertainty relation ' @xmath12 ) .",
    "temporal resolution is @xmath13 ms .",
    "this figure shows an intense narrow ( total bandwidth @xmath14 khz corresponding to @xmath15% ) auroral kilometric radiation band emitted in the x - mode and being structured by a sequence of many short radiation pulses of similar though not identical negative spectral drift @xmath16 and with highest intensities being restricted to a bandwidth of @xmath61 to 2 khz only .",
    "drifts range around 100 khz / s .",
    "some internal structure may be indicated down to the 33 ms time resolution , but the intense emissions are close to saturation , and the reality of the finest structures of @xmath6 0.1 to 0.2 khz in frequency is questionable ; their proximity to the ion cyclotron frequency is intriguing and might point to some kind of modulation of the radiation though .",
    "this is of less interest in the context of this paper but might be related to observations of modulation of solar radio called ` zebra bursts ' @xcite .",
    "the non - shaded window in this figure corresponds to a snapshot of highest resolution electron flux data shown in figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] .",
    "three seconds of electron data measured by good fortune in highest available resolution during the high - resolution radiation observations of figure [ fig - rad ] shown in figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] are divided into three groups : downward auroral current electrons at pitch angles @xmath17 in the top panel , upward mirrored ( magnetically trapped ) electrons with pitch angles @xmath3 in the bottom panel , and perpendicular electrons with pitch angles @xmath18 in the middle panel .",
    "mirrored upward electrons have pitch angles outside the loss cone being of slightly higher energy but much lower fluxes .",
    "all electron fluxes are modulated in energy and intensity .",
    "the two slices labelled a and b are later used for determination of reduced downward and upward distribution functions in figure [ fig - dist ] .",
    "auroral downward electrons exhibit quite intense fluxes , in a few cases even reaching into saturation . on the other hand ,",
    "perpendicular electron fluxes never reach saturation even though their colour bar is set more than half a magnitude lower than for the downward electrons . thus , perpendicular electron fluxes are at least one order of magnitude lower than downward fluxes .",
    "this observation , though not of importance for electron holes , is crucial in the calculation of the cyclotron maser radiation from a horseshoe - ring distribution .",
    "the lower part of figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] shows a 20 ms snapshot of electric field wave forms ( panel two in figure [ fig - over ] ) parallel labelled e near - b ) and perpendicular ( labelled e perp - b ) to the magnetic field .",
    "the time slice to these measurements is the dark vertical line across the upper three panels in this figure .",
    "the behaviour of these wave forms is typical for the entire downward electron ( upward current ) time period in figure [ fig - over ] .",
    "the reason for choosing the above slice was that only during this particular slice in the entire sequence of high resolution observations the antennas were directed approximately parallel and perpendicular with respect to the magnetic field direction , thus yielding the clearest picture of the spatial electric field structure .",
    "inspection of this short though representative sequence of wave forms shows the presence of a chain of short scale ( @xmath6 few ms ) bi - polar or non - symmetric quadru - polar electric field structures passing the spacecraft along the magnetic field and obeying a uni - polar or at most bipolar perpendicular electric field structure and reaching parallel amplitudes in this slice of @xmath6300 mv / m . these electric signals are typical for electron holes and , when being fourier transformed , account for the extremely broad band signals in the low - frequency electric wave spectra in the third panel of figure [ fig - over ] . clearly , with its @xmath6100 ms time resolution the electron instrument has no chance to resolve any of those structures .",
    "if one would be very brave one could interpret some yellow or even green spots in the red band in the top panel as signatures of an accumulation of electron holes on the electron energy flux which , however , would be highly speculative , and we refrain from it . at the currently available resolution of electron instrumentation on spacecraft",
    "the resolution of electron holes in the auroral kilometric radiation source in the electron distribution is illusory .",
    "reduced parallel distribution functions obtained from the electron measurements in the two time slices of figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] are plotted in figure [ fig - dist ] . there",
    "the heavy lines belong to downward fluxes while the light lines show reflected magnetically trapped electron distributions .",
    "the full distribution has been used such that at low velocities ` photo'-electrons ( labelled ` background ' ) around the spacecraft pollute the observations .",
    "the combination of upward and downward reduced distributions is typical for a ring - horseshoe electron distribution caused by the well - known combination of the mirror force and accelerating local parallel electric field on the electrons in the auroral kilometric radiation source region .",
    "these distributions have been obtained by integration over the indicated times ( temporal slices ) .",
    "as expected , they do not exhibit signatures of the short - scale electron - holes in figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] .",
    "the dip on the top of the green curve results fro the temporally weaker electron fluxes in slice a at maximum and can not be taken as clear indication of electron holes .",
    "the distribution in slice b shows even less fluctuation , except for the statistically confirmed peak at its high - speed flank before exponential cut - off .",
    "this peak results from the repeated higher energy spots separated from the main distribution in slice b in figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] . in consultation with numerical simulations",
    "we will below argue that it might be due to the presence of electron holes .",
    "we have not attempted to determine a perpendicular distribution as no electron holes are expected to be present there anyway . since holes can not be resolved in the electron distributions , we have also not attempted to determine an oblique slice of the distribution function .",
    "it would not provide any deeper insight into the structure of the electron distribution .",
    "as for an example of a full distribution we plot in figure [ fig - dist-2 ] one of the best measured full electron ring - horseshoe distributions obtained under similar conditions but taken from another auroral passage . in those measurements the partial ring pops out at high parallel weakly relativistic velocities just below @xmath19 km / s . the distribution exhibits a well expressed loss cone at negative @xmath20 while at pitch angles near @xmath21 the ring disappears and flattens to fill the gap to the background .",
    "this flattening is also found in the parallel direction in figure [ fig - dist ] where , however , it is not strong enough to completely deplete the ring . in both cases flattening and filling",
    "the gap is probably due to wave- particle interactions mostly , however , caused by vlf .",
    "it has been shown that vlf is excited at high growth rate in the presence of positive perpendicular velocity gradients @xcite . whether the electron - cyclotron horseshoe maser is involved into the depletion of the distribution",
    "remains an unanswered question .",
    "its growth rates are smaller than vlf growth rates and , in addition , at the extremely low plasma densities in the auroral kilometric source the confinement of the free - space waves which is necessary for causing quasi - linear depletion of the ring distribution is so far unproven .",
    "in fact , the x - mode cut - off and upper hybrid frequency coincide within few tens of hz at plasma frequency @xmath22 khz and cyclotron frequency @xmath23 khz yielding a cut - off at @xmath24 khz .",
    "excitation of the x - mode at @xmath25 , which corresponds to wave lengths @xmath26 km , prevents escape of the waves only for very steep plasma gradients .",
    "such gradients exist at the boundaries of the large - scale auroral cavity where the radiation is scattered back ; but for confinement multiple scatterings are required which also bring the wave out of resonance .",
    "quasilinear calculations and simulations of the electron cyclotron maser emission assume complete confinement and resonance over the entire box and thus grossly overestimate quasilinear depletion .",
    "in order to blame electron holes for their contribution to the generation of electron cyclotron maser radiation , electron holes require producing steep _ perpendicular _ velocity gradients on the electron distribution function .",
    "in this section we sketch the process which leads to formation of electron holes . historically , electron holes have been predicted @xcite being caused due to the grainy structure of the momentum space occupied by a collisionless plasma .",
    "in such a collisionless case the particles are not densely packed in configuration space being separated by quite large spatial distances which causes electromagnetic fields to act between them over these distances .",
    "since the action is not instantaneous but is propagated by plasma oscillations at finite phase and group velocities , the distribution of particles ( electrons in this case ) can not become completely smooth yielding lumps of electrons separated by regions of relatively strong electromagnetic fields .",
    "plasma fluid theory indeed reproduced solutions of this kind : solitons , bernstein - green - kruskal modes @xcite and also genuine electron holes sometimes called microscopic double layers or even electrostatic shocks ( for an extended review of theory and experiment cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "but the dynamics of such structures could only become investigated more closely with the help of numerical particle simulations .",
    "these simulations showed a number of unforeseen effects of which the most interesting is that electron holes are genuinely non - stationary .",
    "an instructive example is reproduced in figure [ fig - simul ] ( adapted with changes from * ? ? ?",
    "before , however , coming to describing what physically important conclusions can be drawn from it and what their relevance is in view of the electron - cyclotron maser radiation we have in mind , it is necessary to briefly go into the mechanism by which such holes arise in a completely collisionless plasma .",
    "there are two stages for the evolution of holes in plasma .",
    "the first is the identification of the relevant plasma instability which amplifies the electric field choosing a particular range of wave numbers and frequencies from the always available thermal background fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the second stage refers to the nonlinear evolution of the hole and its possible long - term behaviour which might result in saturation .",
    "simulations demonstrate that saturation is not achieved because of non - stationarity of the holes , hence this second stage is only intermediate .",
    "the instability relevant for production of electron holes is the instability of the buneman mode .",
    "since , for the production of radiation , we are interested only in electron structures we take the ions as immobile and restrict to electron motion and electron driven instability .",
    "it has been shown in this case that for sufficiently strong current flow along the magnetic field @xmath27 two important instabilities evolve in the plasma , the purely electrostatic buneman mode @xcite , and the purely electromagnetic weibel @xcite or weibel - filamentation @xcite modes .",
    "the former generates high - frequency @xmath28 electrostatic field fluctuations on scales @xmath29 several @xmath30 of the order of several debye - lengths ; the latter generates very low frequency @xmath31 magnetic fluctuations on scales of the order of the electron - inertial scale @xmath32 . here",
    ", @xmath33 are the respective ion and electron plasma frequencies , @xmath34 the debye length , @xmath35 the electron thermal speed , @xmath36 electron temperature ( in energy units ) , @xmath37 electron - rest mass , and @xmath38 the ( non - relativistic ) electron cyclotron frequency in the magnetic field of strength @xmath39 .",
    "this mode is primarily unimportant in the process of generation of radiation .",
    "however , in very fast ( possibly relativistic ) current flows @xmath40 it may generate sufficiently strong transverse magnetic fields to deflect the electrons ( and even the ions , in which case it leads to formation of small - scale shock waves , cf .",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and thus modify the buneman instability conditions .",
    "though both modes may be simultaneous , for electron - hole formation only the buneman mode is of interest .",
    "it is excited when the electron - current drift velocity @xmath41 along the magnetic field  where @xmath42 is measured in the ion frame , i.e. it is the effective relative average drift velocity between the electrons and the ions leading to current flow  exceeds the electron thermal velocity @xmath43 . in this case",
    "the central wave number of the buneman mode becomes @xmath44 , and its frequency @xmath45 and growth rate @xmath46 become respectively @xmath47 @xmath48 indicating that the buneman mode is a very fast growing ( reactive ) mode with growth rate of the order of its frequency ( * ? ? ?",
    "21 - 25 ) .",
    "the condition on the wave number indicates that the buneman wave - length @xmath49 exceeds the debye length by the factor @xmath50 .",
    "initially , its phase velocity is easily found to be a fraction of the electron current drift speed @xmath51 during the evolution of the instability and formation of electron holes this velocity increases due to momentum exchange between the plasma and the hole until the hole is speeded up to nearly current flow velocity .",
    "the fast - growing small - scale high - frequency electric fields amplified by the buneman instability grow on the expense of the electron current drift along the magnetic field .",
    "those electrons which are slow , i.e. of energy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the maximum ( or minimum ) potential drop in the buneman mode , are scattered by the buneman mode and , depending on the sign of the electric field become either trapped in or expelled from the region of the wave .",
    "this effect is the well - known action of the ponderomotive force exerted by a fluctuating electric potential field on the electric charges in question , this time the highly mobile electrons .",
    "thus the buneman mode causes a spatial structuring of the otherwise homogeneous plasma ; in its deep negative potential wells it traps electrons whose energies are low in the proper frame of the wave , while it repels all those electrons from the regions of high positive wave potentials . in this way it also causes a spatially varying separation of the electron distribution into two components , a trapped component and an escaping accelerated component",
    "this is the essence of the physics of bernstein - green - kruskal modes and the ingredient of the model calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , in addition , the numerical simulations show that this state is not final .",
    "it can not be kept for ever simply because the trapped electrons have their own dynamics , and in addition the reaction on the current flow causes scattering of the current and thus weak dissipation which locally decreases the current velocity until it drops below the electron thermal speed respectively the electron temperature is artificially increased by the split in the distribution function and the condition for excitation of the buneman mode becomes violated .",
    "then the instability ceases and the holes become destroyed .",
    "these times amount to many plasma periods , times of the order of @xmath54 or longer .",
    "when this happens , the nature of the instability changes because at @xmath55 the ion - acoustic instability takes over and dominates the further evolution of the plasma .",
    "however , since the plasma is highly structured at these times , the ion - acoustic instability becomes different from that in a homogeneous plasma , and the strong inhomogeneity on the scale of the ion - acoustic wave length must be taken into account .",
    "this is a formidable task ; but its essence is that the ion - acoustic instability leads to a further structuring of the plasma with formation of larger scale holes in which now the ions are also involved and which flow at much slower speed than the electron holes along the current staying behind the flow .",
    "an additional modification concerns the obliqueness of current flow with respect to the magnetic field . in an oblique current",
    "the instability changes character becoming the modified two - stream instability with typical frequency near the lower - hybrid frequency @xmath56 .",
    "the nature of hole formation changes in this case as well .",
    "the parallel component of the current will still drive the buneman mode unstable as long as @xmath57 , but the perpendicular component excites lower - hybrid modified - two stream waves .",
    "numerical vlasov simulations @xcite as well as model calculations @xcite indicate in addition , that electron holes are very narrow in configuration space while occupying a substantial part of parallel velocity space .",
    "moreover , two - dimensional and three - dimensional simulations @xcite show that the structures in configuration space are unstable in the perpendicular spatial direction against bending , breaking off into smaller spatial structures and radiating vlf waves . when artificially injecting a low - amplitude oblique electrostatic seed - whistler in order to control the interaction with the holes in the perpendicular spatial direction @xcite it is found that bending sets in after about @xmath58 simulation times , and after roughly @xmath59 simulation times perpendicular destruction of the holes is completed leaving structures of same parallel and perpendicular spatial sizes while having amplified the seed - whistler . in this case",
    "the bending and destruction of the holes occur entirely in configuration space .",
    "these considerations set the frame for our discussion of electron - hole generated electron - cyclotron maser radiation in the following sections .",
    "the fact which can be learned from the simulation shown in figure [ fig - simul ] and briefly described in the caption to that figure can be summarised semi - quantitatively to the extent of their relevance for the electron - cyclotron maser under auroral - kilometric conditions as follows :      ( i ) electron holes grow from a - few @xmath30 scales to a few-10@xmath30 scales along the magnetic field . by growing ,",
    "electron holes in close proximity coalesce both in configuration and momentum space leaving behind a long wake of dilute hot electron plasma .",
    "this is seen from comparing the snapshots taken in the first and third panels in figure [ fig - simul ] which are separated by @xmath60 time steps which corresponds to @xmath61 s in the observations .",
    "\\(ii ) in velocity space they grow and move into the region of the beam .",
    "this effect is due to momentum exchange with the beam . the holes .",
    "lacking electrons , resemble positive charges on the negative electron background and become attracted by the beam , an effect which has been described analytically for narrow holes @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) holes split the electron velocity distribution into a narrow cold accelerated - beam distribution and a broad hot though very dilute distribution .",
    "the generation of the cold beam is a very interesting side effect as it provides a mechanism of strong electron cooling and acceleration .",
    "the cooling amounts to roughly a factor @xmath62 in temperature , the acceleration to a factor @xmath63 in energy .",
    "\\(iv ) the hot electron distribution trapped inside the hole observes a comparable temperature increase of factor @xmath64 in temperature .",
    "these electrons , in the ion frame , have about symmetric propagation direction , positive and negative along the field , typical for particles being electrically trapped and bouncing back and forth between the walls of the potential well .",
    "their density is rather dilute because only a restricted number of electrons can become trapped and kept in a potential trough .",
    "\\(v ) for the electron cyclotron maser most important is the production of a steep positive velocity gradient between the trapped distribution inside the hole and the cold electron beam bounding it from the high speed side , and a rather weak ( flat negative ) velocity gradient toward the interior of the hole .",
    "the cyclotron maser mechanism requires the velocity space gradient in the perpendicular direction which in numerical simulations is not considered .",
    "below we justify the existence of such a perpendicular velocity space gradient .    in order to apply the insights obtained from the simulations we need to approximately quantify them with the help of the observations shown in figures [ fig - akr - spectrum ] and [ fig - dist ] .",
    "and we have to translate the one - dimensional simulation results into the two - dimensional velocity - space plane of the anisotropic electron ring - horseshoe distribution like the one observed in the auroral kilometric radiation source ( i.e. figures [ fig - dist ] and [ fig - dist-2 ] ) .",
    "quantification is done by listing the known parameters of the auroral kilometric radiation source region .",
    "all the following numbers are approximate only , though .",
    "this , however , has little effect on the main argument and conclusions .",
    "the plasma frequency in the range under discussion during auroral kilometric conditions is of the order of @xmath65 khz corresponding to very low plasma densities .",
    "the electron temperature , on the other hand is @xmath66 few kev , or a thermal velocity of @xmath67 kms@xmath68 , compared to a nominal bulk downward ring - horseshoe beam velocity of @xmath69 kms@xmath68 .",
    "this corresponds to a debye length of @xmath70 km and a spatial extension of the electron hole parallel to the magnetic field of the order of @xmath71 km .",
    "the electron gyro - radius at the velocity of the bulk flow is about @xmath72 few times 10 m. the thermal electron gyro - radius is roughly @xmath73 m. hence , on the scale of the hole the electrons are magnetised even when trapped .",
    "when heated by a factor of 1020 this becomes by a factor of 35 larger , i.e. 2030 m.    what concerns the transverse scale of the holes in velocity space we note that @xcite observed about spherical holes in configuration space in the @xmath74 auroral case which corresponds to the auroral kilometric radiation source of interest here . in _ weak _",
    "magnetic fields it is claimed from numerical experiments that the holes are elongated perpendicular to the magnetic field due to the large gyroradii of electrons @xcite , forming pancakes in configuration space .",
    "this does not apply to the auroral radiation source , rather it holds in the solar wind .",
    "electron holes thus extend in configuration space also in perpendicular direction , at least over distances of the trapped electron gyro - radius .",
    "this implies that , in the frame of the moving hole , the ring - horseshoe distribution becomes substantially distorted by the presence of the hole also in perpendicular velocity up to perpendicular velocities of the trapped particles .",
    "this is schematically shown in figure [ fig - hole - rad-1 ] on its right - hand side . referring to the simulation results ,",
    "the distortion of the ring distribution implies generation of a fast gyrating cold beam and trapping of lower energy electrons inside the hole .",
    "in addition , however , it also implies the production of a steep positive perpendicular gradient in velocity space over some distance in @xmath20 and , at the same time , a weak negative gradient in perpendicular velocity pointing into the hole toward the trapped electron population .",
    "it we take the acceleration of the persistent cold electron beam in the wake of the merged electron holes in figure [ fig - simul ] to be roughly @xmath75 , then its velocity becomes @xmath76 kms@xmath68 .",
    "this is already truly relativistic .",
    "the temperature of this cold beam on the other hand is substantially less , of the order of @xmath77 kev .",
    "the hot trapped electrons have instead temperature of the order of @xmath78 kev comparable to the thermal spread of the ring distribution .",
    "unfortunately little is known about the relative phase space densities from the simulations ; acknowledging , in addition , that the simulations demonstrate the evolution of electron holes but are not representative in comparison to observational number densities , we may refer to figure [ fig - dist ] instead .",
    "the little high - speed peak at the curve labelled ` high ' , when interpreted as an averaged - over signature of the cold accelerated beam , suggests that the phase space density of the cold beam is roughly @xmath79 times that of the auroral electron beam forming the global ring - horseshoe distribution .",
    "the density is still low , dominated , however , by the horseshoe ( the background being mainly photo - electrons ) .",
    "hence , the phase space density of the relativistic cold beam becomes about @xmath80 @xmath9 .",
    "the density of the trapped particles in the centre of the hole is not known since the hole is not resolved by the instrument .",
    "it is probably another factor of @xmath79 or even more less .",
    "however , in estimating the effect on the radiation we need only relative numbers , as we will argue in the next section .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    as promised , this subsection provides an argument for the limited perpendicular extension of electron holes in velocity space .",
    "the above reasoning implies that trapped electrons are readily thermalised . in this case",
    "the hole extends up to trapped thermal velocities @xmath81 km / s in @xmath2 , i.e. almost up to angles of 60@xmath4 in figure [ fig - dist-2 ] .",
    "a more physical argument going beyond the simple previous argument based on the electron gyroradius can be provided as follows when referring to the above reviewed theory that electron holes are generated by the buneman instability .",
    "this instability requires that the _ parallel _ electron ( current ) drift velocity in the ion frame must exceed the thermal spread of the electron distribution .",
    "the ion speed is about @xmath82 km / s directed upward along the magnetic field ( which would add to the electron speed ) but which can be taken as zero in the auroral case . for gyrating electrons with perpendicular velocity @xmath2",
    "this condition should hold for each fixed @xmath83 const .    in a ring distribution",
    "we have @xmath84 with @xmath85 the pitch angle . hence , at where we used the observational values for @xmath43 and @xmath86 .",
    "these numbers correspond to pitch angles of @xmath87 up to which the buneman instability is unstable at finite @xmath2 , setting a limitation on the perpendicular extension of electron holes in velocity space .",
    "( one should note that electrons are magnetised and therefore there is only one perpendicular velocity coordinate , not two . )",
    "this justifies our assumption that any electron holes generated by the buneman instability will necessarily have a finite extension in perpendicular velocity space .",
    "because of this extension any electron holes in magnetised plasmas produce steep velocity space gradients on the electron distribution function which are restricted to the edges of the holes in parallel and perpendicular direction .",
    "the above expression may be used to estimate the shape of an electron hole in phase space .",
    "dividing by @xmath43 we obtain @xmath88 .",
    "since the parallel extension of the hole is @xmath89 the two axes of the hole are approximately comparable , at least within the uncertainty of our measurements . in a first approximation",
    "it will thus not be unreasonable to assume a circular cross section shape of the hole in particular as the observations of @xcite render some experimental support to this assumption .",
    "inspection of the schematic in figure [ fig - hole - rad-1 ] suggests that any cyclotron - maser radiation that is related to the electron hole should exhibit a band of emission and a band of absorption which will appear in tandem .",
    "the emission band is caused by the steep positive velocity gradient at the high - speed boundary of the hole ; conversely the absorption band is caused by the negative velocity gradient pointing from the hole boundary into the centre of the hole . since both gradients occur at different places in velocity space , a gap in frequency space develops between them which is caused by the difference in the resonance conditions .",
    "this fact complicates the theory with respect to the consideration of the simple ring distribution or the dory - guest - harris distribution ( for the latter case see * ? ? ?",
    "however , there is another serious complication which is introduced by the geometric form of the hole in velocity space . the electron hole in figure [ fig - hole - rad-1 ] is not centred at the origin of the velocity space .",
    "hence , in principle , the resonance condition should become a displaced ellipse in velocity space as known from the general resonance .",
    "the implication is that electron holes are well suited to    \\(i ) generate oblique electron - cyclotron maser radiation emitted at a finite angle against the magnetic field ;",
    "\\(ii ) this radiation will for the same reason in general be in a frequency range that is not restricted to the immediate vicinity of the electron cyclotron frequency but can occur at higher frequencies quite above the electron - cyclotron frequency .",

    "moreover , the perpendicular phase space gradient is about completely depleted .",
    "hence global ring - distributions should have substantially smaller growth rates .",
    "the flattening of the perpendicular velocity gradient has been discussed above .",

    "well below the x - mode cut - off of the ambient ( horseshoe ) plasma after decay of the hole , escape is inhibited .",
    "a further problem is caused by the motion of the hole along the magnetic field , causing changes in the local cyclotron frequency and thus modifies the resonance thereby substantially reducing the possible amplification factor .      before investigating the effects which can be seen after transforming back to the stationary observer ( spacecraft ) frame",
    ", we briefly investigate the rate of absorption in the hole .",
    "as already noted , absorption takes place in the interior of the hole , caused by the low energy ( in the hole frame ) though high temperature electrons whenever the hole passes through a background bath of radiation with appropriate frequency .",
    "this may happen when it travels across the radiation field of the global ring - horseshoe distribution or when radiation emitted by other holes passes the hole .",
    "we have noted already that the bandwidth of this radiation band will be approximately of the same order as that of the emission band .",
    "however , the central frequency of the absorption band lies at higher frequency than that of the emission , which is a consequence of the resonance condition .",
    "still , in the hole frame for strictly perpendicular waves the frequency should lie as well below the electron - cyclotron frequency and , thus , the emission and absorption bands may mutually overlap for their finite bandwidths .    in order to calculate the absorption rate we return to eq .",

    "thus we may assume @xmath200 , and the maximum absorption rate can be estimated to be @xmath201 which is substantially less than the emission rate .",
    "nevertheless , absorption of electromagnetic radiation is a feature which belongs to the physics of radiation from electron holes .",

    "entering into its centre , they deform the horseshoe sufficiently strongly such that steep perpendicular phase - space gradients are produced .    such holes , as we have shown by direct calculation for a simple model , will necessarily generate band limited electron maser radiation with bandwidth comparable to the observed bandwidth of few khz ( or few % of @xmath103 ) . in the hole frame",
    "this radiation is emitted in the x - mode in the direction perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field .",

    "this is , however , marginal because at such scales inhomogeneities of the plasma will come into play already . if this starts to be the case , refraction effects can not be neglected anymore and the radiation might assume obliqueness and couple to other free space modes like the o - mode .",
    "such problems have not been considered here .",

    "the growth rates produced by single electron holes are thus weak for the reason that few electrons only are involved into generation of radiation . on the other hand , as long as @xmath225 the mechanism will work , since the growth rate is proportional to the number density fraction @xmath159 of electrons in the cold hole - accelerated beam and to the ratio @xmath226 it steeply grows with increasing density .",

    " it is simple matter to transform the results to the fixed observer frame .",
    "since the radiation source is not distributed over space and momentum space , the transformation from the hole to the observer frame along the magnetic field takes into account the parallel hole motion @xmath124 .",
    "relativistic transformation than turns the radiation , which was strictly perpendicular in the hole frame , into oblique direction in the observer frame . at the same time",
    "the emitted frequency becomes doppler shifted either down or up by the receding or approaching holes , respectively .",
    "thus emission frequencies above the local electron cyclotron frequency become also possible for modestly relativistic parallel hole velocities .",
    "this is the case , because @xmath124 is of the order of the weakly relativistic ring - horseshoe beam velocity .",

    "we may check this assumption with reference to figure [ fig - akr - spectrum ] , where no electron data are available .",
    "the bending of the fine structures in the upper radiation band observed at @xmath66.5 s implies that the hole has passed close to the spacecraft after approaching it and afterwards recedes from it . at the bending which corresponds to closest approach",

    "hence the drift in this case can indeed be interpreted as being due to doppler shift in emission frequency of the downward moving radiating electron holes .",
    "all these results support the view that electron holes are a vital player in the electron - cyclotron maser theory of auroral kilometric radiation  and possibly also in other objects , solar radio bursts , radiation from planets @xcite like jupiter and saturn and astrophysical objects as possibly shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "the exact form of a hole perpendicular to the magnetic field is not known yet .",
    "thus our assumption might be wrong by a factor varying between 1 and 10 in the ratio of the two main axes of the hole which implies that the circular structure would have to be replaced by an elliptical form either flat or elongated in the direction of the magnetic field ( the latter being more probable in the strong auroral magnetic field case ) .",
    "clearly this will affect the emitted radiation .",
    "it will , however , barely substantially change the steepness of the gradient into perpendicular velocity direction .",
    "thus growth rates will remain to be similar .",
    "what will change , is the bandwidth of the radiation and absorption as well as the angle under which radiation is emitted since these depend on the phase - space geometry of the hole . for",
    "non - circular holes in phase space radiation will have an intrinsic oblique component , and the bandwidth will increase .",
    "these effects are important but could not be considered in this paper .",
    "the second caveat concerns the consideration of only one hole .",
    "we estimated that the auroral kilometric source region contains a multitude of holes which all contribute to radiation and absorption at slightly different frequencies .",
    "these differences inhibit that emitted radiation from one hole will become amplified by passing another hole because the frequency of its emitted radiation is out of resonance with the other hole .",
    "it might accidentally happen to be so , however the more probable case is the former nonresonant case .",
    "it might also not be absorbed , however .",
    "thus its power decays as the square of distance from the hole .",
    "otherwise the radiation of the many holes contributes simply to the spectral width .",
    "this , however , is for perpendicular emission restricted to a narrow band near @xmath103 only which unresolved then covers a band around @xmath103 similar to those observed .",
    "since in real configuration space these holes are at different distance from the observation facility their individual radiation intensities decay with distance from spacecraft .",
    "a proper model should therefore include the spatial and velocity space distribution of holes in order to account for their global contribution .",
    "fourth , electron holes themselves obey a violent internal evolution with time when evolving from buneman instability or by any other means .",
    "they grow , merge , decay , saturate and so on .",
    "all these effects have not been considered here but in nature will necessarily also affect the emission of radiation , causing time variations , drop - outs and other temporal effects . since energy loss due to radiation should , however , not be extraordinarily large , it might not be expected that a model of radiation saturation by exhausting the energy of holes will be appropriate as all the other much more violent effects will much more strongly contribute to hole dynamics , saturation , stabilisation or even destruction of the holes .",
    "being phase - space structures , holes can not be indefinitely stable but will decay by internal processes of which radiation emission will presumably be one of the weakest while its observation will still provide information about the dynamics of the holes .",
    "in fact , comparing the energy flux in the electrons in figure [ fig - electrons - eh ] with that in the auroral kilometric radiation in figure [ fig - rad ] we find that the latter is at least six orders of magnitude less than the former .",
    "finally we come to the most serious weakness of our theory , viz . the very small estimated growth rate of the hole - emitted radiation .",
    "this small growth rate implies that the e - folding time of radiated power flux @xmath234 is @xmath235 at the central @xmath236 khz in figure [ fig - rad ] .",
    "this time is thus of the order of @xmath22 s , much too long for generating the observed power flux of @xmath237 w / m@xmath185 within a few ms fraction of time .",
    "assuming that the measured power would be emitted in 30 ms , comparable to the time resolution , then the thermal background of the radiation which would be amplified by the hole - cyclotron maser should have power flux @xmath238 w / m@xmath185 .",
    "this is impossible because the background flux is roughly five orders of magnitude lower ( as read from the blue background noise in figure [ fig - rad ] ) being around @xmath239 w / m@xmath185 .",
    "referring to the large number of electron holes involved , an escape could be searched in the number of holes contributing to one of the fine structures .",
    "this would require @xmath240 holes in each fine structure behaving alike .",
    "in addition to the reservations noted earlier , this number is unreasonably high compared to the @xmath241 holes passing across the spacecraft within one second along the magnetic field . if holes had transverse sizes of , say , 20 m , it would require that the holes occupying a fluxtube of @xmath242 km radius near spacecraft would all contribute to one fine structure in fig .",
    "[ fig - rad ] , which we believe is unrealistic .",
    "the missing ingredient is a high resolution precision measurement of the electron energy flux which would resolve the holes in the horseshoe distribution .",
    "this requires measuring the electron distribution with time resolution of a few ms and energy resolution of , say , @xmath610 ev at @xmath243 kev .",
    "clearly an instrumentation capable of this can not be based on spacecraft spin for it must be able to measure the electron flux simultaneously in both the parallel and perpendicular directions to the magnetic field .",
    "here we are facing a real problem which we have not and could not overcome so far .",
    "though everything in this theory seems to fall into its place , the quantitative estimate of the growth rate obtained is unsatisfactorily small such that it reproduces the observations only qualitatively and does not quantitatively account for the observed power in the auroral kilometric fine structures .",
    "we have provided an argument based on trapping of the radiation inside an electron hole for sufficiently long time , the life time of the hole against destruction by transverse instability . trapping increases the amplification of the power by maintaining resonance between the radiation and the velocity space gradient .",
    "estimated powers can in this way become comparable with observation .",
    "however , it remains unexplained how radiation could ultimately escape to free space .",
    "the theoretical results obtained in this communication have been produced by two methods , a qualitative consideration from the viewpoint of the observer frame and a quantitative approach in the hole frame .",
    "one might object that the two methods will not lead to the same result because the radiation in the observer s frame is genuinely oblique ( the resonance circle becomes an ellipse shifted out of the origin ) with @xmath244 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - kpara ] ) , while this obliqueness is not accounted for in the hole frame .",
    "this objection applies indeed only , when the hole is not circular as assumed here . in the case of an elliptic electron hole",
    "the radiation emitted will be genuinely oblique and not constricted to be generated with its fundamental below the local electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "but even in that case the calculation is easier to perform in the hole frame and subsequently transforming the result back into the observer s frame .",
    "this is possible because the hole represents kind of a point source which emits radiation of the order of the bandwidth provided by the size of its resonance circle . on the other hand ,",
    "the qualitative results given for the circular hole in the observer s frame , i.e. the bandwidth of the emission and the resonance frequency , agree completely with those obtained in the hole frame for the reason that in the circular hole frame just one single resonance circle is needed in the steep gradient of the hole , while in the observer frame for strictly perpendicular emission a substantial number of resonance circles fill the interval between @xmath245 , the maximum and minimum resonance radii , each of them crossing the steep perpendicular gradient in a very narrow interval only .",
    "this is obvious from figure [ fig - hole - rad-1 ] .",
    "the line composed of all these narrow crossing segments of the resonance circles is identical to the resonance circle in the proper hole frame .",
    "thus the estimate performed in the observer s frame agrees completely with the result obtained in the hole frame . of course this should be so , because the relation between the two frames is just a relativistic translation .",
    "the theory of electron hole radiation given here is simple and beautiful .",
    "it reproduces several features of the fine structure in the auroral kilometric radiation .",
    "however , the low growth rates are still in disagreement with the measured fluxes .",
    "this holds at least for the data of fast 1773 used in this paper where the plasma frequency in the upward current region was particularly low . in the case of fast 1750,shown in figure [ fig - akr - spectrum ] ,",
    "the plasma density was somewhat larger yielding a one order of magnitude higher growth rate which , however , is still quite small and insufficient for reproducing the observed spectral radiation flux .",
    "one possibility of improving is amplification of radiation by wave trapping inside the electron hole .",
    "this has been discussed briefly .",
    "it brings up , however , some additional problems like modification of resonance and the general problem of radiation escape .    a possible way out of this dilemma could be attributing the generation of fine structure in the auroral kilometric radiation not to the upward but to the _ downward current _ region . here the densities and plasma frequencies are much larger while still @xmath219 . from observation it is known that phase space holes including electron holes exist in multitude here as well",
    ". however , the different physics of the downward current region requires a different treatment of holes and generation of radiation .",
