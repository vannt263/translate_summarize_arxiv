    "this time lag effect was first interpreted as a result of photon delay due to downscattering of hard x - ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the disk or ns surface @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the photon time lags were an intrinsic signature of the interaction of the comptonized radiation with the ns and accretion disk plasma .",

    "the observed energy - dependent time lags need disk density of a factor of seven higher",
    ". the hard lags of the emission due to compton upscattering are negligible because of the expected compactness of the accretion column region .",
    "however , one can notice in figure [ fig : bestfit ] that there are signs of turnover ( saturation ) for time lags vs energy at @xmath10320 kev for  and 1751 which are similar to that in  which has a turnover at about 7 kev .",
    "the high values of @xmath57 with respect to @xmath40 would not allow us to see the contribution of the hard lags in the resulting time lag vs energy plot .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the energy - dependent time lags allow us to reveal the plasma density variation within 10% near the ns .",
    "it implies that the mass accretion rate and ultimately the observed luminosity should also vary within 10% .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the observed variability of x - ray radiation in the compact objects is presumably driven by this variation of the density of the mass accretion there .",
    "measurements of time lags have been done for black hole binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "making a comparison between these measurements and that of time / phase shifts between x - ray pulsations in accreting msps is difficult . in the case of black hole binaries ,",
    "the time lag is generally calculated in two different energy bands and is related to different fourier frequencies . for black holes , the fourier frequency dependence can be due to hydrodynamical disk instability , mass accretion configuration , or quasi - periodic instability .",
    "this work with accreting millisecond nss provides a unique advantage since the x - ray pulsations give a perfect clock which allows to determine precise information about the photon delay at different energy bands .",
