    "magnetically ordered spin systems with coupled electron - nuclear spin oscillations attracted general interest for a long time owing to their very peculiar nonlinear properties . in such systems",
    "the dynamics of the paramagnetic nuclear spin system is governed by the exceptionally strong ( of the order 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4oe ) hyperfine field from the magnetically ordered electron spin system . in turn , the motion of electron spins is affected by the hyperfine field from the nuclear spins .",
    "this results in coupling between oscillations of electron and nuclear spin systems . from the microscopic point of view",
    ", one can describe such systems by pointing out that the coupled oscillations of the nuclear spins with the magnetically ordered electron subsystem introduce a long distance correlation between the precession of different nuclear spins .",
    "@xcite this correlation can be described in terms of nuclear spin waves , i.e. n - magnons . from this point of view",
    "the hyperfine interaction leads to the hybridization of , on the one hand , usual spin waves in the magnetically ordered electron subsystem , i.e. e - magnons , and , on the other hand , the precession of a nuclear spin around the direction of the hyperfine field . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows examples of spectra for hybridized e - magnons ( frequency @xmath5 ) and n - magnons ( frequency @xmath6 ) in a weakly anisotropic antiferromagnet mnco@xmath0 . at zero wave number , @xmath7 , the frequency of n - magnons to a good approximation",
    "is given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the frequency of precession of the nuclear spin in stationary hyperfine field , that is when the oscillations of the electron spin system caused by coupling to the nuclear spins are neglected , and @xmath10 is a quantity that depends on a number of parameters including the temperature of the nuclear subsystem . at large",
    "@xmath11 the spectrum of this branch approaches @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the correlation between motion of different nuclear spins is significant only for small enough @xmath11 , or in other words over a distance of typically 10@xmath13 - 10@xmath14 lattice sites . for the existence of @xmath15-magnons",
    "the frequency difference between @xmath16 and @xmath9 must satisfy the condition    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the spread in the frequency @xmath9 due to inhomogeneities of the atomic and magnetic structures of the sample ( inhomogeneous broadening ) and due to relaxation processes ( homogeneous broadening ) .",
    "there are a few crystalline materials which satisfy this condition .",
    "most notable examples are the weakly anisotropic antiferromagnets with @xmath19mn as the magnetic ions , such as mnco@xmath20 , csmnf@xmath20 , rbmnf@xmath20 , kmnf@xmath20 , etc",

    "@xcite     in the static magnetic field of @xmath21koe and at two values of temperature of @xmath22k ( dashed - point line ) and @xmath23k ( solid line ) .",
    "the dashed lines show corresponding spectra in the case when coupling between electron and nuclear oscillations is neglected.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    an equivalent macroscopic description of coupled electron - nuclear spin systems is also possible .",
    "@xcite owing to correlated motion of a huge number ( typically @xmath24 ) of spins , both the magnetically ordered electron spin subsystem and the paramagnetic nuclear spin subsystem can be described by a corresponding macroscopic net magnetization vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the hyperfine interaction energy is given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the hyperfine interaction constant .",
    "like for any two classical coupled oscillators , the spectrum of coupled precession of @xmath25 and @xmath26 vectors exhibit repulsion between the precession frequencies of two uncoupled spin subsystems .",
    "this results in two branches of a hybridized magnetic resonance , i.e. the quasi nuclear ( q - nmr ) and quasi electron ( q - afmr ) modes of precession .",
    "the frequency of q - nmr mode is approximately given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the magnitude of the hyperfine field and @xmath32 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclear spin ) , @xmath33 is the magnitude of the nuclear magnetization vector , and @xmath34 is the magnitude of the projection of the vector @xmath35 on the direction of stationary hyperfine field @xmath36 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : freq ] ) is usually referred to as the dynamical frequency shift , or frequency pulling .",
    "note that for @xmath37 , that is for negligible deflection of the nuclear magnetization vector from the equilibrium position , the frequency of q - nmr mode approaches the bottom of the n - magnon spectrum , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : bot ] ) . from the equivalent microscopic point of view",
    ", the magnetization deflection may be described by a density of non - equilibrium magnons excited by a pulsed or cw radio - frequency ( rf ) pumping .",
    "we note that the frequency of q - afmr mode decreases with the increase of the density of non - equilibrium magnons .",
    "this means that the e - magnons have an attractive interaction and the homogeneous precession is unstable .",
    "in contrast , the frequency of q - nmr mode increases with deflection of nuclear magnetization from equilibrium .",
    "this shows the repulsive interaction between n - magnons and leads to stability of the homogeneous precession .",
    "since the n - magnons obey bose - einstein statistics , there arises an important question about whether the non - equilibrium magnons can form a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) at rf pumping that creates a sufficiently large density of non - equilibrium magnons .",
    "the peculiar non - linear properties described above are very similar to magnetic properties of the superfluid phase of @xmath14he .",
    "therefore , in this section we would like to review main experimental findings in this system , in particular the formation of a bec of non - equilibrium magnons .",
    "the first study of nonlinear magnetic resonance in superfluid @xmath14he was performed at the kapitza institute in moscow and revealed a long lived induction decay signal after a pulsed nmr pumping in @xmath14he - b.@xcite this signal was explained as a formation of a domain with a homogeneously precessing nuclear magnetization .",
    "@xcite this state corresponds to the phase - coherent precession of magnetization even in a strongly inhomogeneous static magnetic field and corresponds to the global minimum of the ginzburg - landau potential for a non - equilibrium magnon system .",
    "later , this state was associated with the formation of magnon bec , and it is possible to show a close analogy between the formation of atomic bec and magnon bec .",
    "@xcite    more recently , another type of magnon bec was observed in thin films of yttrium iron garnet ( y@xmath20fe@xmath38o@xmath39 ) in a static magnetic field applied along the plane of the film .",
    "@xcite in this case the minimum of the global energy corresponds to the spin waves with the wave numbers @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "this magnon bec state corresponds to a high - amplitude interference pattern of stationary spin waves with wave vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and has some similarities with the charge density waves in superconductors .",
    "we will not consider this type of magnon bec here .",
    "the condition for magnon bec formation follows directly from bose - einstein statistics according to which the occupation number for the magnon state with the wave number @xmath11 is given by    @xmath44^{-1 } , \\label{eq : be}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 is the chemical potential and @xmath46 is the effective temperature of the nuclear system . as usual",
    ", the condition for the formation of a bec with @xmath7 corresponds to @xmath47 .",
    "the atomic bec forms when the temperature of an atomic system decreases below the critical temperature @xmath48 at which @xmath49 . in the case of a magnon system , for which @xmath45 is always zero in thermal equilibrium , one needs to create non - equilibrium magnons by external rf pumping to increase their chemical potential . correspondingly , at a given temperature @xmath46 the bec is formed when condition @xmath50 is reached .",
    "the critical density @xmath51 of the magnons which satisfy the above condition can be written as  @xcite    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the density of thermal magnons at a given temperature @xmath46 .",
    "the critical density of magnons is related to the angle @xmath54 of deflection of the macroscopic nuclear magnetization vector from its equilibrium orientation as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is roughly the number of the nuclear spins in a sample . since typically @xmath57 , the critical angle @xmath58 needed to reach bec can be as low as a few degrees .",
    "@xcite the next question is the stability of non - equilibrium magnons .",
    "if homogeneous precession is not stable , the thermalization of the magnon system leads to the increase of the temperature of magnetic system and the critical density of magnons given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bec ] ) increases .",
    "however , if coherent precession of magnons is supported by the minimum of the magnetic energy potential , then the magnons form the bec which lives a relatively long time .",
    "thus , the stability of homogeneous precession of nuclear magnetization is the crucial point in the formation of bec .",
    "next , let us discuss the fundamental difference between magnon bec state and usual magnetic resonance in magnetically - ordered media . usually in the analysis of magnetic resonance in a sample",
    ", we must take into account the inhomogeneous broadening of the nmr line .",
    "the magnetic resonance signal is formed by a set of relatively independent magnetic oscillators which have different local frequencies . in the case of magnetically - ordered media",
    "the correlation between these oscillators appears on the distances of the effective magnetic interactions , i.  e. @xmath59-@xmath60 interatomic distances . in the magnetically - ordered media considered above , the precession frequency depends on the deflection angle of the magnetization , therefore on the density of pumped non - equilibrium magnons and interaction between them",
    "this interaction can be attractive or repulsive . in the first case ,",
    "the well - known effects of instability in atomic bec  @xcite and magnon bec  @xcite take place .",
    "we are interested in the second case when it is energetically favorable to conserve the homogeneity of precession .",
    "when the density of non - equilibrium magnons reaches the critical value , they form condensate described by a single macroscopic wave function . the magnons in bec precess with the same frequency and with a small spreading of the phase which compensates for the inhomogeneity of the external conditions . in the bec state ,",
    "the transverse component of magnetization is described by a wave function @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the magnitude of the projection of the magnetization vector on the plane perpendicular to the stationary hyperfine field and @xmath63 is the phase of the wave function at @xmath64 .",
    "this wave function describes all properties of the spin superfluidity .    the best system for investigation of magnon bec and spin superfluidity is superfluid @xmath14he - b .",
    "in this system , there were found many phenomena which have one to one correspondence with the analogous phenomena of mass superfluidity and superconductivity .",
    "for example , critical supercurrent and phase slippage @xcite , the josephson spin - current effect @xcite , as well as spin - current vortices  @xcite and goldstone modes  @xcite , were found . during the last 30 years",
    ", five different magnon bec states were found in the @xmath14he superfluids .",
    "comprehensive reviews can be found in the literature@xcite .",
    "unlike @xmath14he - b , the a - phase of superfluid @xmath14he has a different magnetic properties .",
    "the superfluid @xmath14he - a is an easy - plane two sublattice liquid antiferromagnet , which magnetic properties are described by a classical antiferromagnetic hamiltonian .",
    "homogeneous precession of the magnetization in bulk @xmath14he - a is not stable due to the attractive interaction between the magnons .",
    "such an instability was predicted theoretically  @xcite and also observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "later it was suggested by bunkov and volovik  @xcite that a reorientation of the orbital momentum of @xmath14he - a could lead to a repulsive interaction between the magnons and to their bec formation .",
    "this suggestion was confirmed in experiments with @xmath14he - a immersed in aerogel which had been squeezed along the magnetic field . in this case",
    ", aerogel orients the orbital momentum of @xmath14he - a along the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite in such a configuration the magnon bec was observed .",
    "@xcite    the observation of magnon bec in @xmath14he - a is important for the subject of this paper because the dynamic properties of nmr in antiferromagnets , as discussed here , are similar to the dynamic magnetic properties of superfluid @xmath14he - a in squeezed aerogel .",
    "the magnon bec in the system with suhl - nakamura interaction was predicted  @xcite and subsequently found in csmnf@xmath0 and mnco@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite this observation sparked a discussion about magnon bec in solid magnets .",
    "the main objection was related to the question of magnetic relaxation .",
    "it is customary to describe the nuclear magnetic relaxation by the phenomenological bloch equations according to which the deflected magnetization must thermalize on a time scale @xmath65 .",
    "however , pulsed nmr experiments showed the formation of a relatively long lived induction decay signal , similar to one observed in the superfluid @xmath14he - a .",
    "@xcite this indicates that the nuclear magnetization is not described by the bloch equations .",
