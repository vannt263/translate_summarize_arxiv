    "originally formulated for the analysis of scattering problems involving solution of hyperbolic wave equations in the exterior domain of compactly supported obstacles , the lax - phillips scattering theory@xmath2 was developed as a tool most suitable for dealing with resonances in the scattering of electromagnetic or acoustic waves .",
    "subsequent to its introduction by lax and phillips , various authors have contributed to further development of the theory@xmath3 .",
    "notable recent additions were made by sjstrand and sworski@xmath4 who extended the scope of the theory to include general classes of semibounded , compactly supported perturbations of the laplacian in the wave equation , and by kuzhell , via the development of a formalism providing conditions for the application of the lax - phillips structure to an abstract form of the wave equation@xmath5 and to certain classes of schrdinger operators@xmath6 .",
    "in addition , kuzhell and moskalyova@xmath7 applied the lax - phillips theory in the analysis of scattering systems involving singular perturbations of the laplacian .",
    "several recent papers have dealt with the adaptation of the lax - phillips theory to quantum mechanical scattering problems .",
    "an early work in this direction is ref .",
    "a general formalism was developed in ref .",
    "14 and subsequently applied to several physical models in ref .",
    "15,16,17 . such efforts to adapt the lax - phillips formalism to the framework of quantum mechanics",
    "are motivated by certain appealing features of the lax - phillips theory .",
    "one of these features is the fact that the time evolution of resonances in this theory is given in terms of a continuous , one parameter , strongly contractive semigroup @xmath8 @xmath9    if @xmath10 is a ( separable ) hilbert space corresponding to a particular scattering system and @xmath11 is a unitary group defined on @xmath10 describing the evolution of the system , the basic premises of the lax - phillips theory include the assumption of the existence of an _ incoming subspace _ @xmath12 and an _ outgoing subspace _",
    "@xmath13 with respect to @xmath11 which are assumed furthermore to be orthogonal to each other . denoting by @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively the projections on the orthogonal complements of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in @xmath10 , and letting @xmath16 , the lax - phillips semigroup @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 annihilates @xmath19 and maps @xmath20 into itself .",
    "the subspace @xmath20 contains the scattering resonances and the lax - phillips semigroup @xmath8 describes their time evolution . in the lax - phillips framework resonances",
    "are associated with pure states in the hilbert space @xmath10 .    a basic difficulty encountered in the work on application of the lax - phillips theory in quantum mechanics originates from the fact that in this theory the continuous spectrum of the generator of evolution is required to be unbounded from below as well as from above .",
    "hence a formalism utilizing the original structure of the theory , such as in ref .",
    "14 , is not suitable for application to large classes of scattering problems in quantum mechanics ( except for limited types of problems , such as the stark effect hamiltonian@xmath21 , or problems in a relativistically covariant framework@xmath22 , which can be analyzed by direct mapping to the lax - phillips structure .",
    "the case of a schrdinger equation with compactly supported potential may also be analyzed within the lax - phillips framework through the use of the invariance principle of wave operators@xmath23 ) .",
    "the subject of the present paper is a theoretical framework , termed the _ semigroup decomposition _ of resonance evolution , developed with the goal of overcoming such difficulties . proposed by one of the authors ( y.s . ) of the present article@xmath24 , this formalism makes use of the sz .- nagy - foias theory of contraction operators and contractive semigroups on hilbert space@xmath25 which , from the mathematical point of view , is the fundamental theory underlying the lax - phillips construction through the notion of model operators for @xmath0 class semigroups ( see section [ semigroup_decomp_subsec ] ) .",
    "the presentation of the semigroup decomposition formalism in ref .",
    "20 is based on the following assumptions :    1 .",
    "we are considering a scattering system consisting of a `` free '' unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath26 and a perturbed hamiltonian @xmath27 , both defined on a hilbert space @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   @xmath28 . for simplicity",
    "it is assumed further that the multiplicity of the a.c .",
    "spectrum is one .",
    "the mller wave operators @xmath29 exist and are complete .",
    "the @xmath30-matrix in the _ energy representation _ ( the spectral representation for @xmath26 ) , denoted by @xmath31 has an extension to a meromorphic function @xmath32 in an open , simply connected , region @xmath33 such that @xmath34 is an open interval in @xmath35 .",
    "the operator valued function @xmath32 is holomorphic in @xmath36 and has a simple pole ( we generalize to the case of multiple poles in section [ approx_res_state_sec ] below ) at a point @xmath37 and no other singularity in @xmath38 , the closure of @xmath39 .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "20 that there exists a dense set @xmath40 and a well defined state @xmath41 such that for any @xmath42 and any @xmath43 the properties ( i)-(iv ) above induce , for positive times , a decomposition of matrix elements of the evolution @xmath44 in the form @xmath45 in a sense to be made precise in the next section the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sem_dec_general_form ] ) originates from an evolution semigroup of lax - phillips type and the eigenvalue of the generator of this semigroup is exactly @xmath46 , i.e. , the point of singularity of the @xmath30-matrix . the quantity @xmath47 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ sem_dec_general_form ] ) is what we shall call a _ background _ term .",
    "we note that if in eq .",
    "( [ sem_dec_general_form ] ) we choose @xmath48 to be orthogonal to @xmath49 then the exponentially decaying semigroup term ( second term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ sem_dec_general_form ] ) ) vanishes .",
    "we call @xmath49 an _ approximate resonance state _ and note that the characterization of @xmath49 as an approximate resonance state rather than as an exact resonance state stems from the fact that one can show ( see ref .",
    "20 ) that there is no choice of @xmath50 and @xmath48 that makes the backgound term @xmath47 vanish .",
    "an explicit expression for the approximate resonance state @xmath49 is provided in ref . 20 .",
    "it is shown there that , if we denote by @xmath51 the set of outgoing solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation ( using dirac s notation ) , then @xmath49 is given by @xmath52 following the introduction of approximate resonance states , the present paper discusses some generalizations .",
    "thus , in section [ approx_res_state_sec ] we assume that the region @xmath53 contains multiple resonance poles of the @xmath30-matrix @xmath32 , say at @xmath54 and obtain the form of the expression for the approximate resonance states and semigroup decomposition of evolution matrix elements in this case .",
    "in particular , we apply the semigroup decompostion to the _ survival amplitude _ , a central notion in the characterization of the time evolution of resonances .",
    "theorem [ background_estimate_thm ] below then provides an _ a priori _ upper bound on the size of the background term in this case .    as a final remark",
    "we note that a modification of the lax - phillips theory was recently used by h. baumgartel for the description of scattering resonances in certain quantum mechanical problems@xmath55 ( see also ref .",
    "23 ) . in particular ,",
    "the assumption of orthogonality of @xmath19 , essential in the context of the original lax - phillips formalism , is replaced in ref .",
    "22 by the requirement that an incoming subspace @xmath12 and an outgoing subspace @xmath13 exist and the respective projections commute .",
    "the modified assumptions on @xmath19 , accompanied by certain assumptions on @xmath30-matrix analyticity properties , result in a modified lax - phillips structure which is then applied to the friedrichs model , leading to the construction of appropriate gamow type vectors@xmath56 associated with scattering resonances .",
    "the framework presented in ref .",
    "22 has several points of intersection with the semigroup decomposition formalism discussed in the present paper .",
    "the nature of these relationships will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ semigroup_decomp_subsec ] we describe the formalism providing the semigroup decomposition of resonance evolution starting with a short discussion of the functional model for @xmath0 continuous contractive semigroups followed by a description of the semigroup decomposition formalism introduced in ref .",
    "19,20 . in section [ approx_res_state_sec ]",
    "we extend the framework of ref .",
    "19,20 to the case of multiple resonances and , furthermore , find an estimate on the size of the background term in the expression for the time evolution of the survival probability of a resonance . in section [ example ]",
    "we analyze a simple but illuminating example involving a one dimensional model of scattering from a square barrier potential .",
    "section [ summary ] contains a short summary of the contents of the paper and some indication on further possible courses of investigation .",
    "several distinct classes of contractive semigroups are identified within the framework of the sz .- nagy - foias theory .",
    "let @xmath57 be a strongly contractive semigroup defined on a hilbert space @xmath10 .",
    "the classes @xmath58 , @xmath0 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 are defined by @xmath61 the classes @xmath62 with @xmath63 are then defined by @xmath64 the semigroup @xmath65 describing the time evolution of resonances in the lax - phillips theory is readily characterized by the fact that @xmath66 belongs to the class @xmath0  .",
    "the structure of the lax - phillips outgoing spectral ( and translation ) representation is then determined by that of the _ _ functional model__@xmath67 for @xmath68 class semigroups provided by the sz .- nagy - foias theory .",
    "we say an operator @xmath69 is a _",
    "_ model operator__@xmath70 for a given class @xmath71 of operators if every operator in @xmath71 is similar to a multiple of a part of @xmath69 ( a part of an operator @xmath69 is a restriction of @xmath69 to one of its invariant subspaces ) . by a functional model we mean that the model operator for a given class @xmath71 has a canonical representation on suitable function spaces . for a @xmath0 class semigroup @xmath57",
    "the associated functional model is essentially obtained through a procedure of _ isometric dilation _ of the _ cogenerator _ of @xmath57 and the similarity mapping to the functional model is in fact a unitary transformation .",
    "we turn now to a brief description of the functional model for semigroups in the class @xmath0  .",
    "denote by @xmath72 the upper half of the complex plane and let @xmath73 be the hardy space of vector valued functions analytic in the upper half - plane and taking values in a separable hilbert space @xmath74 .",
    "the set of boundary values on @xmath75 of functions in @xmath73 , denoted below by @xmath76 , is a hilbert space isomorphic to @xmath73 . in a similar manner the hardy space of @xmath74 valued functions analytic in the lower half - plane",
