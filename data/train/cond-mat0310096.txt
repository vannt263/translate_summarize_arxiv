    "a conventional point of view relating to the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity of cuprates is absent up to this point .",
    "nevertheless , there is an experimental evidence that there is the _ singlet _ pairing of current carriers below the superconducting ( sc ) transition temperature in these compounds although the question is what interaction dominates pairing .",
    "@xcite in this connection , the models of the superconductivity both with dominating attraction and repulsion are considered .",
    "@xcite another open question is what contribution into the pair binding energy ( due to potential energy as it is in the conventional theory by bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite or , maybe , due to kinetic energy @xcite ) may be considered as a driven force of the sc transition in the cuprates .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to the conventional paradigm that the sc transition is a consequence of an instability of the fermi liquid with respect to arbitrarily weak attraction between particles the question relating to the character of the ground state of normal ( n ) phase of cuprate compounds remains under discussion .",
    "@xcite the manifestation of the pseudogap in underdoped cuprates is a reason to suppose that the n phase may be something different from the normal fermi liquid .",
    "assuming that cuprates are strong correlated electron systems one can , in principle , connect rather wide spectrum of physical properties of these compounds which include , besides typical of cuprates superconductivity and antiferromagnetism ( af ) , some other ordered states arising due to a competition of sc and af orders .",
    "@xcite in this connection one can raise the question of the applicability of the mean - field theory ( like the bcs theory which describes conventional superconductors successfully ) to cuprate superconductors .",
    "@xcite    pairing with zero total pair momentum does not impose any kinematical constraint on the momenta of the relative motion coinciding , in this case , with the momenta of the particles composing the pair . in the bcs model with an attractive interaction between particles , however , there is a `` dynamical '' constraint connected with the fact that the domain of the effective attraction is a narrow layer enveloping the fermi surface .",
    "the volume of this layer is proportional to the statistical weight of the pair that is a number of one - particle states which contribute to the state of the relative motion of the pair .",
    "@xcite    on the contrary , at non - zero total pair momentum there is an essential kinematical constraint resulting in a finite domain of the momentum space in which momenta of the relative motion of the pair should be defined.@xcite a supplementary dynamical constraint arising from an attractive interaction , decreases such a domain abruptly resulting in a considerable decrease in the statistical weight of the pair .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in the case of coulomb repulsion , any dynamical constraint is absent and the statistical weight of the pair is fully determined by the volume of kinematically allowed domain of the momentum space .",
    "the fermi surface of quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system of copper  oxigen planes of a cuprate compound is degenerated into a line which we call the fermi contour ( fc ) . in cuprates ,",
    "the fc is situated in an extended vicinity of a saddle point of the electron dispersion .",
    "@xcite as a consequence , one may expect a fc with strong nesting feature and , correspondingly , a considerable difference in the transversal ( with respect to the fc ) and the longitudinal fermi velocities .",
    "@xcite in addition , one can assume that the corresponding effective masses should be of opposite signs and differ in absolute values considerably .",
    "thus , one can expect that , for some definite ( antinodal ) directions coinciding with the sides of 2d brillouin zone , there exists rather large area of 2d momentum space defining the statistical weight of the pair with certain non - zero total momentum .",
    "@xcite one can create a current - less state corresponding to such a pair as a definite linear combination of the states relating to crystal equivalent momenta .",
    "@xcite    the sc instability of 2d electron system arises due to the fact that the boundary separating occupied and unoccupied one - particle states is a line . in the case of zero total pair momentum ,",
    "this line is the full fc whereas at non - zero total pair momentum such a boundary is , generally speaking , a set of points .",
    "therefore , in such a case , there is no logarithmic singularity in the self - consistency equation and , consequently , the sc pairing is impossible at arbitrarily weak interaction strength .",
    "however , the extended saddle point may result in a rise of such a topology of isolines in a vicinity of the fc that the boundary between occupied and unoccupied states of the pair relative motion turns out to be a set of lines of finite length .",
    "these lines form a `` pair '' fermi contour ( pfc ) for the relative motion of the pair with definite total momentum .",
    "such a feature ( _ mirror nesting _ ) of the fc @xcite is held in a finite doping interval and may warrant a logarithmic singularity in the self - consistency equation resulting in the sc instability at arbitrarily interaction strength .",
    "the channel of the sc pairing with large total pair momentum results quite naturally from a consideration of the competition of cooper ( at zero pair momentum ) sc pairing and af ordering in the framework both a band model @xcite and the models which concern strong electron correlations .",
    "@xcite also , such a channel arises with necessity in rather general phemenology based on symmetry considerations .",
    "@xcite    recent experimental results relating to neutron scattering in cuprates ( the so - called 41 mev peak ) may be considered as an indirect evidence in favor of the sc pairing with large total momentum .",
    "@xcite another two fundamental experimental results , the so - called `` peak  dip  hump structure '' of angle - resolved photoemission spectrum ( arpes ) @xcite and relatively small superfluid phase stiffness typical of cuprates , @xcite can be explaned qualitatively in the framework of _ the conception of mirror nesting and repulsion - induced sc pairing with large total pair momentum _ as well .",
    "the goal of this paper is an investigation of the necessary conditions of the repulsion - induced sc pairing with large total pair momentum and a solution of the corresponding self - consistency equation arising within the mean - field scheme .",
    "the kinematical constraint due to the presence of the fc results in the fact that both momenta @xmath0 of like - charged particles composing a pair with total momentum @xmath1 have to be situated either inside or outside the fc .",
    "thus they belong to dependent on @xmath2 domain of the momentum space which may be considered as a statistical weight of the pair .",
    "this domain @xmath3 is symmetrical with respect to the inversion transformation @xmath4 of the momentum of the relative motion of the pair , @xmath5 , and , generally speaking , consists of the two parts @xmath6 and @xmath7 , inside and outside the fc , respectively .",
    "an excitation energy of the pair with respect to the chemical potential @xmath8 that is kinetic energy of the particles composing the pair , @xmath9 equals zero on the boundary separating occupied ( @xmath6 ) and unoccupied ( @xmath7 ) parts of the domain @xmath3 .",
    "hereafter , for the sake of simplicity , we restrict ourselves to a consideration of hole - doped cuprate superconductors within a simple single - band scheme ; therefore , @xmath10 makes sense of a hole dispersion .",
    "as it is mentioned above , at @xmath11 , the momenta of the relative motion @xmath12 coincide with the momenta of the holes composing the pair and therefore the boundary separating the occupied and unoccupied parts of the domain @xmath3 is the full fc whereas at any @xmath13 the boundary between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , generally speaking , turns out to be a set of isolated points .",
    "however , due to a special hole dispersion , such a boundary , at definite total pair momentum , may coincide with finite - length pieces of the fc as it is shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "in such a case the boundary between @xmath6 and @xmath7 plays role of a peculiar fc with respect to the relative motion of the pair and may be called a _ pair fermi contour _ ( pfc ) .    using the symmetry property , @xmath4",
    ", one can write the condition defining the pfc in the form @xmath14 under the additional condition that both @xmath15 and @xmath16 belong to the domain @xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that , to obey the condition ( [ 2_02 ] ) , the vector @xmath2 should be directed along one of the symmetrical ( antinodal or nodal ) direction of 2d brillouin zone .",
    "hence the boundary separating occupied and vacant states has to obey a mirror symmetry with respect to the pair momentum @xmath2 direction and so eq.([2_02 ] ) may be called _ a mirror nesting _ condition .",
    "it should be also noted that , under mirror nesting condition , the inversion transformation @xmath4 superposes an occupied state with an occupied one and a vacant state with a vacant one , respectively .",
    "domain of definition @xmath17 of pair relative motion momentum ( schematically ; it is shown only a half of the domain ) : the subdomain @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) corresponds to the shaded occupied ( unoccupied ) part of the domain @xmath20 .",
    "these subdomains are separated by the pfc ( solid line ) being a part of the fc ( fine line ) .",
    "the nodal line @xmath21 ( dashed line ) separates the parts of the momentum space corresponding to different signs of the order parameter . ]    in the framework of a single - band scheme relating to cuprates , one can give some rather obvious examples of the mirror nesting condition resulting in a rise of the pfc .",
    "@xcite in a case when the fc of a hole - doped cuprate compound is simply connected and appears as a square with rounded corners , @xcite one can expect that a change of fc curvature sign , which can be easily realized because of the existence of long , almost rectilinear , pieces of the fc , may provide a realization of the mirror nesting condition for certain chosen pair momenta .",
    "@xcite one more single - band example represents an underdoped cuprate compound considering as doped mott insulator in which the fc encloses some symmetrically disposed hole pockets around the points belonging to symmetrical directions in 2d brillouin zone .",
    "@xcite in such a case , the mirror nesting condition is perfectly satisfied when a half of the total pair momentum corresponds to the center of a pocket and the whole of the line enclosing the pocket turns out to be the pfc .",
    "the stripe structure arising in underdoped cuprates gives one more possibility resulting in a rise of pfc .",
    "to consider the problem of pairing with non - zero total pair momentum in the mean - field framework let us write the hamiltonian corresponding to pair relative motion in the form @xmath22}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\frac 1{s } } \\sum_{k , k^\\prime } u({\\bm k}- { \\bm k^\\prime } ) { \\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{k_+\\uparrow } } { \\hat{a}^{\\dag}_{k_-\\downarrow } } { \\hat{a}^{}_{{{k^\\prime}_-}\\downarrow } } { \\hat{a}^{}_{{{k^\\prime}_+}\\uparrow}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the fourier transform of the interaction energy , @xmath25 is a normalizing area , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) creates ( annihilates ) a hole with the momentum @xmath28 and the spin quantum number @xmath29 . the summation in eq.([3_01 ] ) is taken over all range of the allowed values of the momentum of the relative motion and thus is restricted by the domain @xmath30 .",
    "note that the summation in the hamiltonian eq.([3_01 ] ) should be taken over only two ( instead of three in a general case ) variables , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , just as in the case of bcs hamiltonian , taking into account the only interaction between particles composing the pairs with total pair momentum @xmath33 .",
    "as usual , to diagonalize the hamiltonian eq.([3_01 ] ) approximately one can introduce creation and annihilation operators of new quasiparticles using the well - known bogoliubov ",
    "valatin transformation : @xmath34 the hamiltonian , up to the terms of the order of @xmath35 , can be written as @xmath36 the ground state energy has the form @xmath37 where , related to the value of the chemical potential , an energy of the relative motion of the pair with the total momentum @xmath38 is defined by the eq.([2_01 ] ) and the order parameter is defined as @xmath39 diagonal and nondiagonal , with respect to quasiparticle operators , parts of the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath40 and @xmath41 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times ( { \\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{k,{+1}}}{\\hat{b}^{\\dag}_{k,{-1 } } } + { \\hat{b}_{k,{-1}}^{}}{\\hat{b}_{k,{+1}}}^{}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . here",
    "the energies corresponding to two branches ( @xmath42 ) of the one - particle excitation spectrum are equal to each other , @xmath43    a choice of the amplitudes , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , in bogoliubov  valatin transformation eq.([3_02 ] ) is determined in the zero - temperature limit by the conditions that ( i ) all of the states inside the subdomain @xmath6 , in which the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the pair is negative , @xmath46 , must be occupied and ( ii ) the nondiagonal part , eq.([3_07 ] ) , of the hamiltonian vanishes . in addition , the condition @xmath47 preserving fermi s commutation relations for quasiparticle operators must be fulfilled .",
    "these conditions yield @xmath48 it should be noted that the bogoliubov  valatin amplitudes ( [ 3_09 ] ) are determined not by the one - particle energy @xmath49 as it were at @xmath50 but by the relative motion energy ( [ 2_01 ] ) which transforms into @xmath51 just in the case @xmath50 .    in the zero - temperature limit , one can obtain the self - consistency equation determining the sc order parameter , @xmath52 where @xmath31 and @xmath53 are momenta of the relative motion of pairs with one and the same total momentum @xmath33 , @xmath54 a matrix element of the effective interaction potential in the hamiltonian eq.([3_01 ] ) depending on the momentum transfer @xmath55 due to a scattering from an initial ( @xmath31 ) to a finite ( @xmath53 ) state of the relative motion of the pair being also a difference , @xmath56 , between the corresponding momenta of the particles composing pairs with the total momentum @xmath38 .",
    "summation over momenta of the relative motion in the equation ( [ 3_10 ] ) is performed within the whole of their domain of definition @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the sc order parameter is defined inside the domain @xmath57 as well .    to solve the equation ( [ 3_10 ] )",
    "it is convenient to reduce it to the corresponding integral equation considering the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 as continuous functions of the relative motion momentum .",
    "hereafter , for a simplification of all of the notations , we omit the label @xmath33 . using the notations",
    "@xmath60 one can rewrite ( [ 3_10 ] ) in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 may be called a kernel of the non - linear integral equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the necessary conditions of the repulsion - induced sc pairing with large total pair momentum and put forward a procedure of reducing of the mean - field sc gap equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) to an approximate non - linear singular integral equation with a degenerate kernel.@xcite    the matrix element @xmath63 is connected with the effective interaction potential @xmath64 in the real space by the fourier transform @xmath65}d^2_{}r . \\label{4_01}\\ ] ] one can deduce a simple criterion of the absence of non - trivial solutions of the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) .",
    "let us multiply this equation and the function @xmath66 together and integrate the obtained relation over @xmath67 inside the domain @xmath20 .",
    "expressing @xmath63 in accordance with ( [ 4_01 ] ) and changing the order of integration over @xmath68 and @xmath69 one can obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a nonnegative function of @xmath69 .",
    "the integration over @xmath72 in ( [ 4_02 ] ) is performed over the whole of 2d real space . as far as @xmath73 ,",
    "the left side of ( [ 4_02 ] ) is nonnegative as well . if the potential @xmath64 were positive at any @xmath69 , the right - hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ 4_02 ] ) , on the contrary , turns out to be negative and the equality ( [ 4_02 ] ) may be satisfied only in the trivial case when @xmath74 in the whole of the domain @xmath20 . thus , under the condition that the interaction is purely repulsive in the real space that is @xmath75 at any @xmath76 , the self - consistency equation leads only to the trivial solution .",
    "therefore , a rise of repulsion - induced sc order is possible only in the systems where the interaction potential is a function of @xmath76 with alternating signs . as an example of such a potential with alternating signs , one can consider screened repulsive coulomb interaction in a degenerated fermi system which exhibits the friedel oscillations . @xcite",
    "further , we restrict ourselves to a consideration of such a repulsive potential @xmath64 .",
    "one can see that the maximal ( positive ) value of the function @xmath77 , arising when the integral in the right - hand side of ( [ 4_02 ] ) is calculated using the polar coordinates , corresponds to @xmath78 .",
    "this function with alternating signs is multiplied by a nonnegative function @xmath79 defined by eq.([4_03 ] ) . the governing contribution into the product @xmath80 determining the function @xmath79 is due to a small vicinity of the pfc because of the equality @xmath81 which takes place just on the pfc .    as it will be shown below , the gap function @xmath82 resulting from the repulsion interaction changes sign on a line crossing the pfc .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of the integral in ( [ 4_03 ] ) represents a function of @xmath76 appearing as a series of peaks with decreasing magnitude and a character separation between the neighboring peaks of about @xmath83 where @xmath84 is of about the length of the pfc .",
    "the first ( and the largest ) peak results in the fact that the product of the factor @xmath85 with alternating signs and exponential function in the integral ( [ 4_03 ] ) turns out to be a function with the values mainly of constant sign .",
    "the value @xmath86 is , generally speaking , a small quantity because of a partial ( or even full ) compensation of the contributions of the parts of the domain @xmath20 in which @xmath82 has opposite signs . for example , in the case of the full compensation , @xmath87 , therefore the main positive extremum of the function @xmath77 turns out to be suppressed considerably . in the opposite case of large @xmath76 ,",
    "the function @xmath88 is also small due to rapidly oscillating factor @xmath89 .",
    "as far as @xmath84 is pronouncedly less than @xmath90 , the position of the first maximum of the function ( [ 4_03 ] ) , @xmath91 , corresponds quite naturally to the region of the friedel oscillations of the repulsive coulomb potential .",
    "there is a significant region of the @xmath76  -  space in which the integrand in the right hand side of the eq.([4_02 ] ) is negative whereas the contributions of the regions with positive integrand are comparatively small as it is illusyrated schematically in fig.2 .",
    "therefore the integral in ( [ 4_02 ] ) may turn out to be negative .",
    "behavior of the functions @xmath77 and @xmath88 contributing to the right - hand side integral in eq.([4_02 ] ) , schematically .",
    "one can see @xmath88 as the function ( [ 4_03 ] ) averaging over the angle variable . ]    in such a case , the equality ( [ 4_02 ] ) is provided due to the fact that the function @xmath92 is _ singular _ on the pfc and may be _ arbitrarily large _ at @xmath93 .",
    "the magnitude of the oscillations of the function @xmath88 depends on @xmath82 because an effective width of the vicinity of the pfc leading to the main contribution into the integral ( [ 4_02 ] ) is determined by just the function @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the condition ( [ 4_02 ] ) may be fulfilled at sufficiently small @xmath95 .",
    "therefore _ the presence of the pfc _ which results in the singularity of the eq.([3_12 ] ) is _ the first necessary condition _ of the repulsion - induced sc pairing .",
    "the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) is a non - linear integral hammerstein equation with a symmetric kernel @xmath62 .",
    "all of the eigenvalues of such a nondegenerate kernel are real and belong to a discrete spectrum @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 with the condensation point @xmath98 at @xmath99 .",
    "if a kernel @xmath62 is the fourier transform ( [ 4_01 ] ) of everywhere positive effective potential @xmath64 ( a positive defined kernel ) all its eigenvalues are positive as well .",
    "in such a case , as it follows from eq.([4_02 ] ) , the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) has the trivial solution only .",
    "therefore , the presence of at least one _ negative eigenvalue _ in the spectrum of the kernel @xmath62 is _ the second necessary condition _ of the existence of a non - trivial solution of the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that , as it follows from eq.([3_12 ] ) , a non - trivial solution @xmath100 of the self - consistency equation at @xmath101 , if such a solution exists , _ must be a function with alternating signs _ inside its domain of definition @xmath20 .    in the case of the non - degenerate kernel @xmath102 , the existence of such a non - trivial solution of the self - consistency equation at the repulsive interaction can be demonstrated if one represents this kernel as an expansion over its eigenfunctions @xmath103 which are the solutions of the linear integral equation @xmath104 let us write this expansion in the form @xcite @xmath105 and substitute it into the self - consistency equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) . integrating the right - hand side of this equation term - by - term , one can see that a non - trivial solution , if it exists at all , may be represented in the form of an expansion over the complete system of the eigenfunctions @xmath103 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 are the expansion coefficients which can be determined as the solutions of the infinite equation system , @xmath108 here , @xmath109 are the matrix elements of the form @xmath110 where the function @xmath92 is determined by eq.([3_11 ] ) .",
    "multiplying eq.([4_07 ] ) and @xmath111 together , one can , after a summation over @xmath112 , obtain the relation @xmath113 which is analogous to the relation ( [ 4_02 ] ) . as it is follows from eq.([4_09 ] ) , there is only the trivial solution of this equation in the case when all of the eigenvalues are positive .",
    "therefore , a non - trivial solution may , in principle , exist only in the case when at least one of the eigenvalues turns out to be negative .",
    "in fact , such a condition turns out to be not only necessary but the sufficient one .    to prove this statement",
    ", one can take advantage of the obvious analogy between the spectral expansion of the order parameter , eq.([4_06 ] ) , and its expansion into a series of spherical harmonics . as it is well known",
    ", the sc pairing arises when the negative scattering length corresponds at least to one of the values of orbital angular momentum .",
    "@xcite for this reason , taking account of such an analogy , we do not present a direct proof of such a statement within the framework of the spectral expansion.@xcite",
    "the function defining a non - linear operator in eq.([3_12 ] ) has a special form @xmath114 where @xmath115 may be called a nonlinearity factor . in this sense ,",
    "the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) may be referred to the class of quasi - linear integral equations . in the case of a degenerate kernel ,",
    "the significant feature of such equations is that a form of a non - trivial solution ( if it exists at all ) reproduces the kernel structure .",
    "the kernel @xmath62 can be approximately reduced to a degenerate one if one takes into account that both variables , @xmath116 and @xmath53 , are defined in a relatively small domain @xmath20 of the momentum space . therefore ,",
    "if the function ( [ 4_01 ] ) can be expanded into the tailor series , one can restrict himself to some lowest powers of the argument @xmath117 . as it follows from the definition ( [ 4_01 ] ) ,",

    "it should be noted that the fourier transform @xmath122 corresponding to a repulsive interaction is , at small @xmath119 , a decreasing function of its argument resulting in @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    to solve the equation ( [ 3_12 ] )",
    "it is convenient to transform it into a dimensionless form . using two constants @xmath125 and @xmath126 , being characteristic energy and length scales , respectively",
    ", one can define them by the relations @xmath127 and @xmath128 . in the case of screened coulomb potential the parameters @xmath126 and @xmath129 make sense of a screening length and a characteristic coulomb energy respectively .",

    "thus , one can see that the solution of the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) reproduces the momentum dependence of the degenerate kernel . therefore , to solve this equation",
    ", one has to determine the parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath164 . to find these parameters one has to substitute the kernel ( [ 5_03 ] ) and an explicit form of the solution ( [ 6_01 ] ) into the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) .",
    "after that , one obtains a system of integral equations determining the parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath164 .",
    "one of these equations , following from the comparison of the coefficients at the first power of @xmath31 in the left and right sides of the equation resulting from the eq.([3_12 ] ) , has the form @xmath165    the equation ( [ 6_02 ] ) determines the vector @xmath164 implicitly because the right - hand side of this equation depends on @xmath166 which itself depends on @xmath164 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there is at most one solution of the equation ( [ 6_02 ] ) . to prove this proposition",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary function @xmath167 which is a monotonically increasing function of its argument .",
    "writing down the equation ( [ 6_02 ] ) in the component - wise form one can see that its right - hand side is a decreasing function of a component @xmath168 of the vector @xmath164 ( @xmath169 ) whereas the left - hand side increases with @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the equality ( [ 6_02 ] ) turns out to be possible at a single value of the vector parameter @xmath164 .",
    "the obvious solution of ( [ 6_02 ] ) is @xmath170 . indeed , due to central symmetry of the domain @xmath20 , the right - hand side of ( [ 6_02 ] ) vanishes at @xmath170 as a result of an integration of an odd function over a symmetric domain .",
    "it should be noted that the order parameter @xmath82 and the excitation energy @xmath171 are even functions of @xmath67 at @xmath170 .",
    "there are no other solutions of the equation ( [ 6_02 ] ) .",
    "thus , in the case of a degenerate kernel ( [ 5_03 ] ) , the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) may presuppose a simple solution of the form @xmath172 determining the sc gap as a parabolic function of the momentum of the relative motion of the pair .    taking into account that @xmath170",
    "one can write down two equations determining the parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 : @xmath173 where @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "thus , we have a quasi - linear system of the equations ( [ 6_04 ] ) which contains three positive integrals ( [ 6_05 ] ) depending on two unknown parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "first of all , let us multiply the inequality @xmath176 by the function @xmath177 and then by the another function , @xmath178 .",
    "integrating the obtained inequalities over the domain @xmath20 one can deduce two new inequalities , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , which allow to conclude that both coefficients in the first equation ( [ 6_04 ] ) are positive .",
    "therefore , the solutions of the equation system ( [ 6_04 ] ) have one and the same sign ( positive , for example ) . as a result ,",
    "the sc order parameter as a function of the momentum of the relative motion changes its sign at a certain @xmath181 and can be written as @xmath182 where @xmath183 .",
    "the parameter @xmath141 determines an energy scale of the sc gap and @xmath184 is a radius of the circle on which the sc gap vanishes . in the case of repulsive interaction considered here ,",
    "it is obvious that the sc gap has to vanish inside the domain @xmath20 because at @xmath185 there exists no constant - sign non - trivial solution of the equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) .",
    "the conditions that @xmath186 and @xmath187 , as it follows from the second equation ( [ 6_04 ] ) , lead to a restrictive inequality @xmath188 which is a consequence of more strong inequality following from the condition of the non - trivial consistency of the system ( [ 6_04 ] ) . calculating the determinant of the system ( [ 6_04 ] )",
    "one can write down this condition in the form @xmath189 it is seen that it must be @xmath190 . therefore , taking into account that @xmath191 , one can obtain @xmath192 .    instead of the pair parameters @xmath140 and @xmath141 characterizing the sc gap it is convenient to consider another pair , @xmath141 and @xmath193 . to determine these two parameters one can use any pair of the equations ( [ 6_04 ] ) and ( [ 6_07 ] ) .",
    "as one of them it is convenient to use the second equation of the system ( [ 6_04 ] ) writing it in the form @xmath194 then , expressing the left - hand side of the equation ( [ 6_07 ] ) with the help of the second of the equations ( [ 6_04 ] ) , the eq.([6_07 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath195 the system of equations ( [ 6_08 ] ) and ( [ 6_09 ] ) is fully equivalent to initial system ( [ 6_04 ] ) and can be used to determine the parameters @xmath141 and @xmath193 of the sc gap . in this connection",
    ", it should be noted that the integrals @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , because of their dependence on @xmath199 , depend themselves on @xmath141 and @xmath193 .",
    "let us rewrite the equations ( [ 6_08 ] ) and ( [ 6_09 ] ) in the explicit form @xmath200 where @xmath201",
    ". is is impossible to solve the equation system ( [ 7_01 ] ) analytically in the whole of the domain of definition of unknown quantities ( @xmath202 ) because the integrals in ( [ 7_01 ] ) depend on the form of the domain of integration .",
    "however , it is easy to determine these integrals in the two limiting cases of large ( @xmath203 ) and small ( @xmath204 ) values of the gap energy scale @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , at large @xmath141 one can neglect the augent in the radicand of each of the integrals ( [ 7_01 ] ) .",
    "after that , these integrals can be calculated easily and turn out to be proportional to @xmath205 therefore one can obtain the solution of ( [ 7_01 ] ) in a trivial way .    considering the integrals in ( [ 7_01 ] ) in the most interesting case of small @xmath141 one has to take into account the fact that pair excitation energy ( [ 2_01 ] ) vanishes on the line separating occupied , @xmath206 , and unoccupied , @xmath207 , parts of the domain @xmath20 as far as this line ( pfc ) represents a piece of the fc .",
    "this results in a divergence of the integrals ( [ 6_05 ] ) at small @xmath141 and , if one takes into account that the main contribution into the integrals is from a narrow strip along the line @xmath208 , it is this divergence that results in the existence of the solution of the system ( [ 7_01 ] ) .",
    "let us denote a width of the strip as @xmath209 and , taking account of the equation of the line @xmath208 in polar coordinates , @xmath210 , consider an integral of a general form @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a continuous function without any singularity .",
    "let us consider a behavior of this integral at @xmath204 using a strip of the width @xmath209 as an integration domain .",
    "first of all , one can perform an integration over a polar angle in the limits from @xmath213 up to @xmath214 corresponding to the endpoints of the line @xmath215 . then , introducing a new variable of integration @xmath216 , one can perform an integration over @xmath217 in the limits from @xmath218 up to @xmath219 . on account of the smallness of @xmath220 , one can assume that @xmath217 and @xmath216 are connected with each other in a linear way : @xmath221 .",
    "in addition , the argument @xmath217 in the integrand can be replaced by its constant ( at a given @xmath222 ) value corresponding to the pfc : @xmath223 .",
    "thus , after integration over @xmath216 , one can obtain a singular ( logarithmic in @xmath141 ) contribution into the integral ( [ 7_02 ] ) .",
    "besides the singular contribution there is also a regular one which depends on one - particle dispersion and on the form and size of the domain @xmath20 .",
    "this contribution depends on @xmath224 as on a parameter .",
    "thus , the integral ( [ 7_02 ] ) can be represented as @xmath225 where the coefficient in front of the logarithm has the form @xmath226 where an integration over the angle variable should be performed along the pfc ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the regular part of the integral denoted as @xmath227 can be taken equal to its value at @xmath228 .",
    "thus , at small @xmath141 , the equation system ( [ 7_01 ] ) can be written in the form @xmath229 where the coefficients @xmath230 are independent of @xmath224 and can be determined by the expression ( [ 7_04 ] ) in which one has to put @xmath231 whereas the right - hand sides of the equations ( [ 7_05 ] ) depend on @xmath224 and can be written as @xmath232 here @xmath233 are the regular parts of the integrals ( [ 6_05 ] ) .    as it follows from the eqs.([7_05 ] ) , the equation system ( [ 7_01 ] ) has a non - trivial solution with necessity . to prove such a statement",
    "let us consider each of the equations ( [ 7_01 ] ) as an equation of a line on the plane @xmath234 : @xmath235 .",
    "then the point of the intersection of these two lines corresponds to the solution of the equation system ( [ 7_01 ] ) .",
    "putting @xmath236 in these equations one can obtain the left - hand sides of each of them as functions of @xmath141 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "these functions monotonically decrease from @xmath237 at @xmath204 to zero at @xmath238 . due to the inequality ( [ 5_06 ] ) , the second of these functions , corresponding to @xmath239 , with necessity is less than the first one ( @xmath240 ) at any @xmath141",
    ". therefore , at @xmath236 , the solution @xmath241 of the first equation turns out to be more than the solution @xmath242 of the second equation because of the fact that the right - hand side of the second equation is always more as compared to the right - hand side of the first one . in the another limiting case",
    "when @xmath204 , one can use an asymptotic representation of the equations ( [ 7_01 ] ) in the form ( [ 7_05 ] ) .",
    "as far as the right - hand sides of the equations ( [ 7_05 ] ) are finite and @xmath243 at @xmath204 the values of @xmath224 corresponding to @xmath244 can be written as @xmath245 at @xmath240 and @xmath246 at @xmath239 .",
    "taking into account the condition ( [ 5_06 ] ) one can see that @xmath247 .",
    "there is cauchy ",
    "bunyakovsky inequality , @xmath248 , for the quantities @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 defining by such integrals as ( [ 7_04 ] ) therefore @xmath252 and , with necessity , there exists a point of the intersection of the lines @xmath235 .",
    "schematical illustration of the graphic solution of the equation system ( [ 7_05 ] ) . ]    to obtain the non - trivial solution in the case of small @xmath141 one has to perform term - by - term division of the equations ( [ 7_05 ] ) .",
    "this leads to a closed equation determining the parameter @xmath224 . as a result ,",
    "a characteristic energy scale of the sc gap can be found from any equation of the system ( [ 7_05 ] ) and , for example , can be written in the form @xmath253 this relation explicitly determines the dependence of sc order parameter on the momentum of the relative motion of the pair . due to the fact that @xmath254 , it is obvious that the exponent in ( [ 7_07 ] ) is negative .",
    "one can see that , in the case of small @xmath141 , the line @xmath181 intersects the pfc .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that @xmath141 and @xmath193 are the solutions of the equation system ( [ 7_01 ] )",
    ". at @xmath255 the integrals in ( [ 7_01 ] ) are determined by their singular parts following from the integration over a small vicinity of the pfc .",
    "an assumption that the circle @xmath21 does not intersect the pfc means that both the pfc and its small vicinity are situated either inside or outside this circle .",
    "therefore in the whole of this vicinity one may expect either the inequality @xmath256 or the opposite inequality @xmath257 .",
    "in such a case , the integrand in ( [ 7_01 ] ) must be of constant sign and the integral corresponding to @xmath239 has to be less than the integral with @xmath240 because of the inequality @xmath258 following from ( [ 5_06 ] ) . thus , if one consider that the circle @xmath21 and the pfc does not intersect each other the equations in the system ( [ 7_01 ] ) turn out to be incompatible with each other .",
    "consequently , at @xmath255 , the parameter @xmath193 turns out to be such that the intersection of the pfc and the circle @xmath21 arises with necessity .",
    "in such a case , the quantity @xmath259 has different signs on different pieces of the pfc interior and exterior the circle @xmath21 . such a conclusion proved under the condition that @xmath204 valid also at rather small but finite values of the parameter @xmath141 .    as far as the circle @xmath21 intersects the pfc",
    ", one can assume that there exist the minimal , @xmath260 , and maximal , @xmath261 , values of @xmath193 corresponding to the endpoints of the pfc .",
    "taking into account the explicit expressions of the integrals ( [ 7_04 ] ) at @xmath231 , one can obtain an estimation @xmath262 where @xmath263 is an angular size of the pfc and @xmath264 is an average ( over the pfc ) value of the dimensionless fermi velocity .",
    "one can see from eq.([7_07 ] ) that the absolute value of the sc order parameter decreases exponentially with a decrease both of the angular size and the anisotropy ( characterizing by the difference @xmath265 ) of the pfc .",
    "in particular , in the case of repulsion - induced pairing with zero total pair momentum ( when the pfc coincides with the fc ) , the non - trivial solution similar to eq.([7_07 ] ) is absent .",
    "thus , using conventional energy and momentum dimensions , one can write down the sc order parameter , being the non - trivial solution of the self - consistency equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) , in the form @xmath266 where @xmath267 can be treated as an effective interaction strength and @xmath268 is a pre - exponential factor dependent on the momentum of the relative motion of the pair .",
    "the continuous solution eq.([7_08 ] ) of the self - consistency equation can be approximately presented as a step - wise function of the momentum of the relative motion .",
    "@xcite here , we briefly discuss the simplest form of such an averaged solution assuming that the true solution , eq.([7_08 ] ) , is replaced by an approximate one which has the form @xmath269 , @xmath270 , where @xmath271 the parameters @xmath272 and @xmath273 defined by the eq.([8_01 ] ) may be considered as average values of the order parameter inside the domain @xmath20 at @xmath274 and @xmath275 respectively .    performing the averaging of the left- and right - hand sides of the self - consistency equation ( [ 3_12 ] ) one",
    "can obtain the equation system @xcite @xmath276 where @xmath277 , @xmath278 , and @xmath279 is the value of the functional , @xmath280 corresponding to the average value @xmath281 of the order parameter inside the subdomain @xmath282 . the average value of the interaction matrix element @xmath62 corresponding to a momentum transfer @xmath283 is defined as @xmath284 where @xmath285 is a domain of definition of the momentum transfer @xmath286 when an initial momentum , @xmath67 , belongs to the subdomain @xmath282 whereas a final one , @xmath287 , belongs to @xmath288 .    if one represents the functions ( [ 8_03 ] ) in the explicit form , the equations ( [ 8_02 ] ) lead to a closed system of two transcendental equations .",
    "the integrals ( [ 8_03 ] ) over the subdomains @xmath282 are similar to the integrals ( [ 6_05 ] ) .",
    "therefore , there exists a logarithmic singularity of such an integral when the domain of integration includes the pfc .",
    "the analysis of the non - trivial consistency of the eqs.([8_02 ] ) shows that the non - trivial solution exists under the condition that @xmath289 this condition coincides with the well - known suhl ",
    "matthias  walker condition @xcite and is definitely fulfilled in the case of repulsive potentials which have an least one negative eigenvalue .    the approximate approach developed here to determine the order parameter arising at singlet repulsion - induced pairing and corresponding to extended @xmath290  -wave symmetry can be used in the case of @xmath291  -wave symmetry as well . in this connection",
    ", it should be noted that a simple replacement @xcite of the true kernel @xmath292 of the self - consistency equation by a constant @xmath293 treated as an average over the fc hardly ever leads to a non - trivial solution because of the fact that such an averaging procedure , similar to performed in eqs.([4_02 ] ) and ( [ 4_09 ] ) , means the summation over both @xmath67 and @xmath294 resulting in a non - negative value of the constant ( [ 8_07 ] ) in the case of repulsive interaction .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , considering the scattering due to a repulsive interaction @xmath292 , one has to take into account not only a difference between the areas of the momentum space where the order parameter has different signs but also the dependence of the interaction matrix element on the momentum transfer @xmath295 .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that there must be at least one negative eigenvalue of the interaction matrix @xmath296 to ensure the possibility of a repulsion - induced non - trivial solution of the self - consistency equation .",
    "a rise of the pair fermi contour results in the fact that such a necessary condition of repulsion - induced superconducting pairing becomes the sufficient one at arbitrarily weak interaction strength .",
    "it should be emphasized that negative eigenvalues have to arise with necessity in real fermi systems , in particular , due to friedel oscillations of screened coulomb potential .",
    "quasi - two - dimensional electron system typical of cuprate superconductors may be considered as an intermediate case between comparatively weak friedel oscillations in three - dimensional system and one - dimensional charge density wave behavior .",
    "the pair fermi contour arises when , at certain large total pair momentum , there exists mirror nesting of the fermi contour .",
    "repulsion - induced singlet pairing results in an axtended @xmath290-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this parameter is defined inside the domain of definition of pair relative motion momentum and changes its sign on a line intersecting the pair fermi contour .",
    "an anisotropy is a necessary feature of one - electron dispersion which leads to the repulsion - induced non - trivial solution of the self - consistency equation : the corresponding superconducting order is absent in the framework of any isotropic model .",
