    "<S> the origin of ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) in external galaxies whose x - ray luminosities exceed those of the brightest black holes in our galaxy by hundreds and thousands of times is mysterious . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular models for the ulxs involve either intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) or stellar - mass black holes accreting at super - eddington rates . </S>",
    "<S> here we review the ulx properties , their x - ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks supposing the supercritical accretion . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra of the ulx counterparts are very similar to that of ss433 , the only known supercritical accretor in our galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are x - ray sources with luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for a typical stellar - mass black hole @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 . despite their importance in understanding the origin of supermassive black holes that reside in most of present galaxies , the basic nature of ulxs remains unsolved.@xcite the most popular models for the ulxs involve either intermediate mass black holes ( imbh , @xmath2@xmath3m@xmath4)@xcite with standard accretion disks or stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath5m@xmath4 ) accreting at super - eddington rates . </S>",
    "<S> the last idea has been suggested@xcite because of an analogy with ss433 , the only known super - accretor in the galaxy,@xcite and developed in ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> 13 , 18 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was proposed that ss433 supercritical disk s funnel being observed nearly face - on will appear as extremely bright x - ray source . both scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , however , require a massive donor in a close binary .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the ulxs are associated with the star - forming regions and surrounded with nebulae of a complex shape , indicating a dynamical influence of the black hole.@xcite they are not distributed throughout galaxies as it would be expected for imbhs originating from low - metallicity population iii stars . </S>",
    "<S> the imbhs may be produced in a runaway merging in a core of young clusters . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , they should stay within the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found@xcite that all brightest x - ray sources in antennae galaxies are located nearby to very young stellar clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it was concluded that the sources were ejected in the process of formation of stellar clusters in the dynamical few - body encounters and that the majority of ulxs are massive x - ray binaries with the progenitor masses larger than 50m@xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray spectra of the ulxs often show a high - energy curvature with a downturn between @xmath6 and @xmath7kev . </S>",
    "<S> it was called `` ultraliminous state''.@xcite the curvature hints that the ulx accretion disks are not standard . </S>",
    "<S> inner parts of the disks may be covered with hot outflow or optically thick corona , which comptonizes the inner disk photons .        </S>",
    "<S> spectra of almost all optical counterparts of studied ulxs ( with ss433 included ) are shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> main features in all the spectra are the bright heii@xmath8 , hydrogen h@xmath9 , and h@xmath10 emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the lines are obviously broad ; the widths range from 500 to 1500 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> some hydrogen lines are contaminated by nebulae ( over - subsraction of narrow absorptions ) associated with the ulxs . </S>",
    "<S> however the broad emission components in h@xmath9 are clearly seen . in the ss433 spectrum , besides moving lines which form in the relativistic jets , stationary emission lines , the bowen blend ciii / niii @xmath11 and three hei lines are observed . </S>",
    "<S> some of these lines are seen in the ulx spectra.@xcite    all the spectra of the ulxs ( the spectra were reduced by us ) are surprisingly similar to one another . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectra are also similar to that of ss 433 , although the ulx spectra indicate a higher wind temperature . it was suggested in ( ref . </S>",
    "<S> 6 ) that the ulxs must constitute a homogeneous class of objects , which most likely have supercritical accretion disks .        </S>",
    "<S> the total luminosity of a supercritical disk is proportional to the eddington luminosity with an additional logarithmical factor depending on the original mass accretion rate,@xcite because the excess gas is expelled as a disk wind and the accreted gas is advected with the photon trapping , contributing little to the photon luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> however , the uv and optical luminosity in such disks may strongly depend on the original mass accretion rate , because these budgets are mainly produced by the reprocess of the strong irradiation from the wind ( the excess gas ) . optical spectra of ss433 and the ulx counterpart are nearly the same , but in x - rays they are drastically different because we can not observe the funnel in ss433 directly . </S>",
    "<S> it was found@xcite that the mass accretion rates in the ulxs may be by a factor of 1.56 smaller and their wind temperatures are by 1.44 times higher than those in ss433 . in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we show absolute magnitude of all well studied ulxs together with ss433 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one may interpret that ss433 is intrinsically the same as ulxs but an extreme case with a particularly high mass accretion rate , which could explain the presence of its persistent jets.@xcite    in fig.3 we present one more evidence of the super  eddington accretion in ulxs . </S>",
    "<S> the power density spectrum of ss433 exhibit a flat part in the @xmath12hz frequency range.@xcite the presence of such a part is related to the abrupt change in the disk structure and the viscous time at the spherization radius . in this place </S>",
    "<S> the accretion disk becomes thick , which reduces drastically the time of passage of matter through the disk.@xcite the same picture is observed in the well - studied ulx ngc5408 x-1 . </S>",
    "<S> we need longer observations of the ulxs to study their power density spectra in more details . </S>"
