    "grand unified theories  @xcite ( guts ) are the most appealing extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electroweak interactions . being founded on the ideas of force and matter unification they always generate two predictions regardless of their exact realization ; one is the gauge coupling unification and the other is the proton decay . of the two it is the latter that offers",
    "the _ only _ unambiguous way to test guts  @xcite .",
    "however , despite systematic experimental search it has not been observed so far  @xcite .",
    "even if it is observed , a clear test of gut might prove difficult due to inherent model dependence of all relevant proton decay contributions  @xcite .",
    "regardless of that , it is worth asking whether we can expect the test of the gut idea through proton decay experiments with certainty .",
    "there are several generic contributions to nucleon decay in guts .",
    "( for an incomplete list of various studies on proton decay constraints on different unifying theories see  @xcite . ) in the non - supersymmetric case the most important ones are the higgs and gauge @xmath6 contributions . in supersymmetric theories",
    "there are two more contributions that generically predict too rapid proton decay .",
    "these are the @xmath7 and @xmath8 contributions .",
    "of course , the four contributions we mention do not encompass all the possibilities .",
    "( for example , presence of extra higgs representations such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 in an @xmath11 gut can lead to additional contributions through mixing of appropriate components of these representations with the triplet partners of the usual higgs doublets  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to have sizable contributions without any reference to the guts if the theory is supersymmetric  @xcite . )",
    "but , they are certainly the most generic ones",
    ".    it may come as a surprise that despite their multiplicity and diverse origins all of these contributions can in principle be completely suppressed or forbidden the gauge @xmath6 ones .",
    "for example , the so - called matter parity forbids the dangerous @xmath7 contributions and there are numerous different ways to efficiently suppress the @xmath8 operators and higgs @xmath6 operators in realistic scenarios .",
    "( for discussion on suppression of @xmath8 operators see for example  @xcite . ) in essence , the most promising tests of guts can be done through the gauge @xmath6 contributions .",
    "the idea of using the gauge @xmath6 dominated branching ratios for the two - body nucleon decays to distinguish between different gut models of fermion mass has been introduced in the pioneering work of de rujula , georgi and glashow  @xcite .",
    "their idea has been revisited and elaborated on more recently .",
    "namely , it has been shown that it is possible to make clear test of any gut with symmetric yukawa couplings through the nucleon decay channels into antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions  @xcite also hold in the context of flipped @xmath11  @xcite . there ,",
    "the clear test requires symmetric yukawa couplings in the down - quark sector only .",
    "( flipped @xmath11 is to be considered a true gut in the case of further embedding in @xmath12 . )    but , in general , even the gauge @xmath6 contributions can be significantly suppressed if not set to zero .",
    "for example , one can completely rotate them away in the flipped @xmath11 context  @xcite .",
    "the relevant contributions there , which we refer to as the `` flipped @xmath11 contributions '' for obvious reason , represent only one half of all possible gauge @xmath6 contributions in guts .",
    "the other half , which we refer to as the `` @xmath11 contributions '' which is due to exchange of proton decay mediating gauge fields present in an @xmath11 gauge group can not be rotated away without a conflict with the measurements on fermion mixing  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth investigating how efficiently one can suppress these contributions , too . since there are no other gauge @xmath6 contributions besides the two we mention , this allows us to set an absolute upper bound on nucleon decay lifetimes .",
    "crucial importance of those bounds lies in the fact that they are the only way to know if there is ever hope to test the idea of grand unification with certainty through proton decay experiments . even if these bounds turn out to be beyond the experimental reach they set correct lower limit on @xmath13 through an absolute lower bound on the mass of the nucleon decay mediating gauge bosons . in other words",
    ", they are the bounds that can tell us which gut scenarios are _ a priori _ ruled out by experimental data . in what follows we concentrate on guts with the sm matter content , i.e. , the three generation case , due to their phenomenological relevance .",
    "to establish an upper bound on the total proton lifetime we first critically analyze all possible gauge @xmath6 operators contributing to proton decay .",
    "again , we concentrate solely on these contributions since all other contributions can be set to zero .",
    "proton lifetime induced by superheavy gauge boson exchange can be written as follows @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a coefficient which contains all information about the flavor structure of the theory .",
    "@xmath2 is the mass of the superheavy gauge bosons .",
    "@xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the coupling defined at the gut scale ( the scale of gauge unification ) . to find a true upper bound on the total lifetime we need to find the maximal value for the @xmath15 coefficient .",

    "we have investigated the possibility of finding an upper bound on the total nucleon decay lifetime in the context of grand unified theories with the standard model matter content .",
    "this bound originates from the gauge @xmath6 contributions , since all other contributions are quite model dependent and can always be suppressed . in the majorana neutrino case",

    "these bounds are valid in both supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric scenarios and are grand unifying gauge group independent .",
    "moreover , there is no dependence of our results on cp violating phases nor any angles beyond those of @xmath69 .",
    "our bounds are very useful for two reasons .",
    "firstly , in the context of realistic grand unified theories they indicate whether it is possible to test these theories in their _ entire _ flavor parameter space with certainty through proton decay experiments . secondly , they put an absolute lower bound on the mass of proton decay mediating gauge bosons .",
