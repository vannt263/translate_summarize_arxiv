    "utilizing ground - to - space quantum communications with satellites to achieve long - distance quantum key distribution ( qkd ) has been theoretically studied and experimentally proven feasible  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , a global quantum network can be developed by using satellites as trusted nodes .",
    "an satellite uplink scheme is appealing because the energy - demanding and relatively complex photon source remains at the ground , easing the requirements on the satellite and granting the ability to use a variety of different sources .",
    "practical qkd apparatuses  @xcite use either weak coherent pulse ( wcp ) sources  @xcite , or sources of entangled photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "the major challenge of an uplink approach is the additional loss stemming from atmospheric turbulence , leading to low signal compared to the noise of detector dark counts and stray light .    to perform qkd under such challenging conditions",
    ", it is desirable to have the source emit single photons within the shortest time window possible .",
    "this can be achieved with a mode - locked laser , which intrinsically provides short pulses and a high repetition rate .",
    "however such a laser has the inevitable problem of possessing phase correlations between consecutive pulses .",
    "this phase correlation violates an assumption of qkd security proofs  @xcite , and is unsuitable as a photon source for qkd without sufficient precaution . to solve this problem ,",
    "our source produces green photons at 532  nm wavelength by the sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) process , pumped by a pulsed 810  nm laser and a continuous wave ( cw ) laser at 1550  nm .",
    "the hybrid nature of this design enables us to exploit the repetition rate and pulse width of the mode - locked ti : sapphire laser ( 810  nm ) , while phase randomization is accomplished with the short coherence length of the telecom laser .",
    "importantly , the photons at 532  nm allow the use of detectors with the highest detection figure of merit  @xcite available .",
    "additionally , we gain access to fast and stable modulation components designed for the telecom - band around 1550  nm . in this work",
    ", we mainly present the telecom intensity and polarization modulator ( ipm ) to encode quantum keys , as well as the qkd results to verify its performance as one of the building blocks .",
    "the sfg nonlinear optical setup is discussed elsewhere  @xcite .    the desired performance for satellite - based qkd previously discussed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , requires that we consider the following factors when implementing bb84 qkd protocol @xcite with the ipm : ( 1 ) polarization encoding in the four non - orthogonal bb84 states  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of polarization encoding is that earth s atmosphere preserves polarization with high fidelity  @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) compatible with the sfg setup to produce 532  nm green photons . ( 3 ) compatible with ti : sapphire repetition rate , and readily upgradable to several ghz repetition rate .",
    "previous implementations of polarization modulation for qkd include multiple laser diodes @xcite , a single laser diode with multiple optical amplifiers @xcite , a single phase modulator with faraday mirror @xcite , as well as a single polarization modulator @xcite .",
    "the first two approaches @xcite , due to their using distinct sources of light , face the difficulty of making all output quantum states identical in frequency , bandwidth , and intensity ; distinguishing information leads to security loopholes .",
    "the latter two methods @xcite will suffer polarization mode dispersion when two orthogonal modes have to propagate along unsymmetrical optical axes of the same modulator crystal or polarization maintaining fiber , leading to poor polarization states .",
    "long - term thermal stability is also problematic for these implementations , and all exhibit pulse lengths at least two orders of magnitude longer than those obtained with a mode - locked laser .    to avoid the above problems , we present our high speed polarization modulator in the balanced mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) configuration , including detailed descriptions of its design principles , and analysis of the experimental performance of the modulator . the paper is organized as follows :",
    "first we present an overview of the polarization and intensity modulator design , and its role in the entire qkd system ; then we discuss the mathematical modelling of the telecom polarization and intensity modulator ; finally , we show experimental results and the expected performance of decoy - state qkd based on our design .",
    "implementing the bb84 protocol with decoy states requires that the output photons have at least two levels of average photon number . in the simplest case , this entails a _ signal _ state with average photon number @xmath0 and a _ decoy _ state with average photon number @xmath1 . for both levels , the modulator should output one of four polarization states ( horizontal , vertical , diagonal , or anti - diagonal ) , chosen randomly . for all states ,",
    "the average photon number per pulse is less than 1 to keep the multi - photon probability low  @xcite .",
    "however , the decoy - sate qkd protocol allows for a much larger average photon number ( e.g.  @xmath2 ) for signal pulses , as compared to wcp qkd protocols not employing decoy states  @xcite .",
    "our qkd system is based on the sfg photon scheme as showed in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_top_architecture ] , in order to achieve the required modulation performance , pulse length , and phase randomization at the desired wavelength .",
    "the scheme includes a 1550  nm cw laser modulated in amplitude and polarization before being converted to 532  nm through sfg with strong 810  nm pulsed light from the mode - locked ti : sapphire laser .",
    "an overview of the sfg solution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_top_architecture ] ( a ) .",
    "the sfg green photons field intensity @xmath3 for type - i ppktp is proportional to the product @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the telecom and 810  nm optical power intensities  @xcite .",
    "the linear dependence of the output intensity of green photons ( whose spectrum is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : system_top_architecture ] ( b ) ) on the input intensities of both the telecom and 810  nm pumps allows direct modulation of the output light through modulation of only the telecom input .",
    "since we are on at the regime of weak conversion , the spectrum of the generated photons will not be perturbed by the intensities of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the qkd system has two basic parameters that determine the final key rate and maximum distance : quantum bit error rate ( qber ) and sifted key rate .",
    "a nonzero qber is mainly caused by detector dark counts and polarization state visibility  @xcite .",
    "to minimize qber , by utilizing temporal filtering of detector and background noise , we incorporated thin - silicon spad detectors in bob s receiver .",
    "the efficiency of these detectors peaks at a wavelength around 532  nm .",
    "the sifted key rate is determined by the repetition rate of the source , the average photon number @xmath0 , and channel losses .",
    "pockels cells are capable of switching at such short wavelengths , but they require driving electronics operating at a few kilovolts for a @xmath7 phase shift ( @xmath8 ) , preventing such modulators from being operated at the repetition rate of a ti : sapphire laser ( @xmath9  mhz ) , let alone approaching ghz rates desirable of high - speed qkd . instead , our scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_top_architecture ] allows for using conventional electro - optical ( eo ) waveguide modulators to match the desired repetition rate .",
    "the telecom modulation system for implementing decoy - state bb84 protocol consists of an intensity modulator followed by a polarization modulator , as realized by two phase modulators in the balanced mzi configuration that is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_architecture ] ( a ) .",
    "the physical apparatus of this scheme is pictured in fig .  [",

    "the phase and intensity modulators are customized eo linbo@xmath10 modulators from eospace , featuring low insertion loss ( @xmath11  db ) and external 50  @xmath12 termination of the radio frequency ( rf ) driving voltage .",
    "their @xmath8 is as low as only a few volts , compatible with regular analog - digital mixed signal electronics .    to ensure enough key",
    "is being received even when channel loss is high , the system should be capable of modulation at a few hundred mhz .",
    "the factors that limit the system clock rate are the finite bandwidth of the modulator drivers , the finite speed of field programmable gate array ( fpga ) circuit board , and the interface circuits .",
    "the detailed design is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_architecture ] ( a ) .",
    "the modulator driver circuit is comprised of digital - to - analog interface to bridge fpga board and the power amplifier that are both adapted to be dc coupled to the rf ports of all modulators . to accomplish wide - band uniformity of the modulation , the driving signal bandwidth ranges from zero to several hundreds of mhz , resulting in reliable switching between any two polarization states .",
    "this is particularly important when the rf driving is in the lower frequency regime ( e.g.  during source testing ) , because the resulting heat accumulation is detrimental to the stability of polarization states , leading to poor qber performance .",
    "we model the action of the modulation system using the jones matrix approach assuming fully polarized input light and define the following jones vector for the horizontally polarized state : @xmath13 the system is comprised of an intensity modulator ( i m ) , followed by a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) with its fast axis rotated @xmath14 from the input fast axis ( represented by a @xmath15 polarization rotation ) .",
    "both input and output ports of the pbs are coupled to pm fiber . following this is the balanced mzi , and after which is the polarization beam combiner ( pbc ) with pm input and single mode ( sm ) output .",
    "the jones calculus is employed to integrate all of the optical components into a single matrix @xmath16 $ ] @xcite @xmath17 = \\left[\\mathrm{qwp}\\left ( - \\frac{\\pi}{4 } \\right)\\right ] \\left [ \\mathrm{pbc } \\right ] \\left [ \\mathrm{mzi } \\right ] \\left [ \\mathrm{pbs } \\right ] \\left[\\mathrm{ro}\\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{4 } + \\delta\\right ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] the last @xmath18 $ ] is used to rotate from modulation in the circular - diagonal polarization plane to the linear polarization plane , and is performed by fpc_2 in the apparatus .",
    "we consider the intensity modulator separately as it acts globally on the total output intensity independent of polarization .",
    "its mathematical model , as usually defined , is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is modulation depth and @xmath21 is the zero voltage phase , adjustable by applying an external dc bias .",

    "m to the mzi , the actual pbs component has a small rotation offset @xmath31 from the desired @xmath14 , resulting in unequal splitting of the input beam .",
    "thus the real device can be modelled as @xmath32 in the mzi polarization modulator , the relative phase delay between the two arms is controlled by high frequency or dc voltages on each modulator of @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , in the push - and - pull mode .",
    "the effect of the pbs and pbc are included implicitly in the jones calculus , as the matrix for the mzi is diagonal : @xmath35 & 0   \\\\     0 & \\exp \\left [ j\\left ( \\frac{v_2 } { v_\\pi } \\pi \\right ) \\right ] \\end{bmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the @xmath7 phase shift voltage for each phase modulator , and @xmath36 is the zero - voltage phase between two modulators arising from the length imbalance of two arms , denoted @xmath37 .",
    "the value of @xmath37 introduces temperature - caused instabilities into the system and plays an important role in determining the operating wavelength and voltages of the mzi as seen below . to find its value ,",
    "we perform a wavelength scan over a range of more than 2  nm around 1550  nm .",
    "when a linear polarizer and a quarter waveplate are placed after the pbc , the transmitted intensity @xmath38 exhibits an oscillation : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the angle of polarizer with respect to the optical axis of mzi , @xmath41 is the input intensity of mzi .",

    "@xmath45 is the effective refractive index in the optical fiber , taken as constant over the wavelengths of interest ; for wider wavelength range , dispersion in the fiber must be taken into account .",

( [ eq : stokes ] ) indicates the two degrees of freedom that are outside direct control by the phase modulator voltages : the intensity imbalance of the arms modelled by deviation angle @xmath31 , and the initial phase angle @xmath42 which stems from the optical path difference between the mzi arms .",
