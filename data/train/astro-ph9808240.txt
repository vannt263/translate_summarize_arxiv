    "the young crab - like supernova remnants ( snrs ) with their embedded pulsars provide a critical link connecting the supernova phenomena , supernova remnants , and the birth of neutron stars .",
    "these rare snrs are distinguished by their centrally - filled morphologies and non - thermal x - ray spectra .",
    "the emission of such snrs comes predominantly from a synchrotron nebula powered by the young pulsar ( e.g. , seward 1989 ) .",
    "only four confirmed members of this class were previously known : the crab nebula , the msh 1552 nebula , snr b0540@xmath0693 , and g11.20.3 , with its recently discovered 65 ms pulsar ( torii 1997 ) .",
    "several candidate crab - like snr have been identified . these share similar morphologies and spectral characteristics but lack an observed pulsar .",
    "here we report on one of these , n157b ( henize 1956 ) , a snr coexisting with a young ob association lh99 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this snr had been suggested as a crab - like remnant , or a `` plerion '' , because of its centrally peaked morphologies and flat spectra in both radio and x - ray ( wang & gotthelf 1998 and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "recently , a point - like x - ray source , possibly the putative pulsar , has been identified using a deep high resolution _ rosat _  image ( wang & gotthelf 1998 ) .    in this proceedings",
    "we present , the newly discovered ultra - fast pulsar in  ( marshall  1998 ) and highlight its properties .",
    "the serendipitous detection of pulsed x - ray emission provided conclusive confirmation for the crab - like nature of this remnant .",
    "during a search for pulsed x - ray emission from the recent supernova sn  1987a , we discovered a highly significant signal at 62 hz ( marshall  1998 ) .",
    "the signal was found in _",
    "pca data acquired in 1996 and located to within 1 degree of the supernova .",
    "the magnitude of the pulsed flux , however , was too high to be from sn  1987a .",
    "an examination of known x - ray sources within the pca field - of - view ( fov ) reveals several objects with significant flux in its @xmath1 kev bandpass .",
    "these included the bright black - hole candidate lmc x-1 , the 50 ms pulsar , the r136 star formation region , and the supernova remnant .",
    "fortuitously , this lmc field , because of the presence of sn1987a , has been extensively sampled since 1987 by many x - ray observatories including _ asca_. the gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) on - board _ asca_provide arcminute imaging over its @xmath2 kev energy bandpass with high timing accuracy similar to that of the pca ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a pulsar search of the _ asca _  data overlapping the region covered by the pca fov unambiguously identified the pulsed signal with , which lies just @xmath4 away from sn1987a .",
    "this is most vividly demonstrated by the image of the pulsed emission alone ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; this reveals a single source of significant pulsed emission , an _ asca_point - like source located at the coordinates of the snr .",
    "= 6.0 cm    = 6.0 cm    n157b is a barely resolved , moderately bright _ asca _  source in the 30 doradus star formation region .",
    "is clearly imaged in the _ asca_gis as an isolated source , @xmath5 southwest of the r136 region , and @xmath6 northwest of the .",
    "the origin of the unpulsed x - rays detected from  in the energy band @xmath7  kev is most likely a synchrotron nebula powered by the pulsar via a relativistic wind ( gallant & arons 1994 and ref .",
    "therein ) .",
    "recent work by wang & gotthelf ( 1998 ) has shown that contains a bright , elongated , and non - thermal x - ray feature whose origin is still uncertain . attached to this feature",
    "is a compact source with a spatial extent of @xmath8 , which they claim likely represents the pulsar and its interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "although the radio morphology is similar to that seen in the x - rays , searches for a radio pulsar have been unsuccessful . the sensitivity of these searches , however , may not be well constraining for a crab - like object at the distance to the lmc ( kaspi , per . comm . ) .",
    "the remnant has probably evolved to a stage close to that of a composite snr .",
    "the elongated feature is most likely due to relativistic particles transported from the pulsar to a radio - emitting wind bubble in a collimated outflow ; a substantial fraction of high energy particles from the pulsar lose their energy radiatively in a bow shock , rather than adiabatically through diffusion ( see wang & gotthelf 1998 for details ) .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the pulse profiles for the 1993 _ asca _  and the 1996 _ rxte _  combined data sets are displayed in fig 2 .",
    "they are well characterized by a single , narrow peaked pulse with an approximately gaussian shape of fwhm of @xmath9 ms ( 10% duty cycle ) .",
    "its x - ray pulse profile , the narrowest among the young pulsars , appears unchanged between the two observations .",
    "the pulse width indicates that the size of the emission region is likely smaller than about half of the light cylinder radius .    from the archival data spanning a 3.5 year baseline we find a period derivative of @xmath10 .",
    "the inferred @xmath11-field for a rotationally powered pulsar is @xmath12 gauss , a typical value for the crab - like pulsars .",
    "the characteristic spin - down age ( @xmath13 years ) is much greater than any of the other crab - like pulsars , yet similar to the age estimate for  based on x - ray measurements of the size and temperature of the remnant ( wang & gotthelf 1998 ) .",
    "chu  ( 1992 ) have placed a possible upper bound on the age of the remnant of @xmath14  yrs , based on the kinematics of h@xmath15-emitting gas in the region .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the x - ray spectrum of , which is dominated by the unpulsed emission , can be characterized by a power law with an energy slope @xmath16 ( wang & gotthelf 1998 ) , significantly steeper than those ( @xmath17 ) of other crab - like snrs ( e.g. , asaoka & koyama 1990 ) .",
    "the pulsed emission is also similar to other crab - like pulsars with a power law of photon index of @xmath18 .",
    "the unabsorbed @xmath2 kev pulsed flux of  is @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding pulsed luminosity is @xmath20 ( into @xmath21 ) assuming a distance of 47 kpc ( gould 1995 ) .",
    "the derived pulsed luminosity suggests that @xmath22 of the pulsar s spin down energy is emitted as pulsed x - rays in the @xmath2 kev band , consistent with the empirical relation for the magneto - rotation driven x - ray emission from previously known pulsars ( gelman 1995 )    psr j0537@xmath06910 rotates twice as fast as the crab pulsar , and was likely spinning much more rapidly when it was born , depending on its assumed braking index and age .",
    "following kaspi  ( 1997 ) , we plot in fig .",
    "4 the possible initial spin period vs. age for a range of braking index . if the older age estimate is correct and if glitches are not important in the overall period evolution of the pulsar , the braking index would then have to be unusually small ( @xmath23 ) for an initial period @xmath24 ms .",
    "if the younger value for the age is more accurate , the initial spin is then a few ms , assuming @xmath25 , as in the case of the magnetic dipole model and for other young pulsars ( @xmath26 ) . in either case",
    ", these values provide important constraints on neutron star birth spin models .",
    "= 8.0 cm    there is compelling evidence that  has undergone one or more glitches between the _ asca _  and _ rxte _  epochs ( see fig .",
    "the integrated magnitude of the glitches , @xmath27 , is comparable to that observed from the vela pulsar , but substantially larger than any of those observed from the crab pulsar .",
    "more careful analysis of the data is still needed , however , to quantify the presence of any glitches and to the distinguish them from timing noise .",
    "this pulsar is remarkable in the following ways :    * it is the most rapidly rotating pulsar associated with a snr , twice as fast as the crab pulsar but with a spin - down rate an order of magnitude slower . *",
    "the x - ray pulse profile appears to be the narrowest among the young pulsars .",
    "the crab pulsar is double - peaked and the profiles of both  and psr b1509@xmath058 are very broad ( duty cycle @xmath28 ) .",
    "the pulse width of the n157b pulsar ( @xmath29 ) indicates that the size of the emission region is likely smaller than about half of the light cylinder radius . *",
    "both the pulsar s spin - down rate and the large - scale diffuse emission of the remnant ( ) suggest an age of @xmath30  yrs , which is much greater than any of the other crab - like pulsars .",
    "thus , n157b has probably evolved to a stage close to that of a composite snr . *",
    "the pulsar shows evidence for glitch(es ) between the 3.5 years separating the _ rxte _  and _ asca _  observations .",
    "the integrated magnitude of the glitches , @xmath31 , is comparable to those observed from the vela pulsar .",
    "* n157b contains a bright , elongated , and non - thermal x - ray feature whose origin is still uncertain . attached to this feature is a compact source , which most likely represents the pulsar , and possibly its interaction with surrounding medium . *",
    "the x - ray power - law energy slope ( @xmath32 ) of the n157b snr is significantly steeper than those ( @xmath17 ) of other crab - like snrs ( e.g. , asaoka & koyama 1990 ) , indicating something unusual may be happening in the remnant .",
    "* like the nearby crab - like , n157b is in the large magellanic cloud ; we can infer physical parameters of the remnant with a good distance determination and with relatively little confusion along the line of sight .",
    "* n157b is the fifth confirmed crab - like remnant .",
    "it doubles the number of known crab - like remnants / pulsars in the lmc !"
