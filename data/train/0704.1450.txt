    "most of the structures with age type swb i lie close or on spiral arms .",

    "it is difficult to speak about ages of the different structures throughout ngc 3367 mainly because , as we have seen , different structures could indicate star associations embbeded in hii regions , very young star cluster embedded in hii regions , star associations not associated with gas , star associations in or around the nucleus , and other combinations . among some of the problems with estimating the magnitudes of different structures are : filling factor , spatial distribution of structure within the aperture , and the fact that we used a circular aperture .",

    "all images except the image in @xmath42 were convolved with an appropiate two dimensional gaussian function in order to have a final of 2@xmath111 full width at half maximum , since the seeing was different for each filter and was about 1@xmath112 to @xmath113 .",
    "the 81 stellar structures reported in this paper were selected mainly from the @xmath61 and the @xmath1 images based on the location in the disk in order to have as many as possible from different positions in ngc 3367 .",
    "we have made careful analysis of the calibration methods to estimate magnitudes and have compared different iraf tasks , in particular , _ qphot _ and _ phot _ utilizing different apertures in order to estimate the uncertainities in the final magnitudes at different filters with 9 stars in m 67 as our standards . in the case of estimating the magnitudes for the structures throughout the disk in ngc 3367",
    ", we have made careful analysis utilizing different iraf tasks , in particular , _ qphot _ and _ phot _ using different aperture diameters for the bright stars in the field of ngc 3367 in order to estimate the uncertainities in the final magnitudes at different filters before estimating the final magnitudes reported for the different structures in ngc 3367 .",
    "the magnitudes reported here for the structures in ngc 3367 were estimated using an aperture radius of 8 pixels ( @xmath38 pc ) .",
    "we were able to estimate the optical magnitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and colors @xmath114 and @xmath3 for 81 different stellar structures throughout the disk in ngc 3367 .",
    "it is difficult to estimated the ages of the structures in ngc 3367 given our circular aperture diameter , equivalent to @xmath4 kpc .",
    "however if their colors were taken as representative as the colors of star clusters ( studied by many other authors with better angular resolution , appropiate chemical abundance and current theoretical star evolutionary tracks ) in the lmc many have colors equivalent to cluster types swb i , and swb ii suggesting that many are young associations with only tens of millions of years of age .",
    "we found 41 structures out of 81 ( 50% ) with age type swb i. several of those structures lie near or in spiral arms ; some lie outside of the bright surface brightness visible disk ( for example the poss image ) .    in order to understand better the large scale environment of ngc 3367 it would also be very important to determine the large scale spatial distribution and kinematics of atomic hydrogen ( hi ) and new observations with high angular resolution of the emission of the molecular gas ( co , h@xmath13 ) in the center of ngc 3367 .",

    "<S> we report new detailed surface @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry of 81 stellar structures in the disk of the barred galaxy ngc 3367 . </S>",
    "<S> the images show many different structures indicating that star formation is going on in the most part of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 3367 is known to have a very high concentration of molecular gas distribution in the central regions of the galaxy and bipolar synchrotron emission from the nucleus with two lobes ( at 6 kpc ) forming a triple structure similar to a radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined the @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes and @xmath2 and @xmath3 colors for the central region ( nucleus ) , a region which includes supernovae 2003 aa , and 79 star associations throughout ngc 3367 . </S>",
    "<S> estimation of ages of star associations is very difficult due to several factors , among them : filling factor , metallicity , spatial distribution of each structure and the fact that we estimated the magnitudes with a circular aperture of 16 pixels in diameter , equivalent to @xmath4 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the colors derived for ngc 3367 were similar to the colors expected of star clusters with theoretical evolutionary star tracks developed for the lmc and had a similar metallicity , ngc 3367 show 51% of the observed structures with age type swb i ( few tens of myrs ) , with seven sources outside the bright surface brightness visible disk of ngc 3367 . </S>"
