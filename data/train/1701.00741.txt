    "the universe is filled by light .",
    "there are two principal sources of such photons  the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "while cmb properties are quite well measured and theoretically understood for more than 20 years ( e.g. @xcite ) , many ebl models with widely different parameters were developed @xcite@xcite ; for instance , the total ebl intensity for these models differs by more than a factor of two @xcite . comparatively recently",
    ", however , some of these ebl models started to converge , at least in the 0.510 @xmath2 wavelength region ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-rays with primary energy @xmath3/\\epsilon ) [ tev]$ ] get absorbed @xcite@xcite ( @xmath4 ) on ebl and cmb photons with energy @xmath5 , reaching maximum cross section at @xmath6/\\epsilon ) [ tev]$ ] @xcite .",
    "therefore , the improved reliability of ebl models allows for more detailed studies of this fundamental quantum electrodynamics process in the @xmath0-ray energy range of about 500 @xmath1 10 @xmath7 , and of extragalactic @xmath0-ray propagation effects in general .",
    "using the cmb for such studies is , in principle , also possible @xcite , but at present is not feasible due to several factors .",
    "indeed , the typical mean free path @xmath8 of a @xmath9 @xmath10= 1 @xmath11 @xmath0-ray on the cmb is @xmath1210 @xmath13 ; for such high energies there is still no discovered sources , while using lower energies is not convenient either as in the @xmath14100 @xmath7 energy region the @xmath15 dependence is very strong : @xmath8 falls for about an order of magnitude for every 10 % of @xmath16 decrease . therefore",
    ", extremely well knowledge of experimental systematics on primary @xmath0-ray energy would be crucial while using cmb photons at @xmath14100 @xmath7 as a probe of the @xmath4 process .    in the present conference contribution we emphasize on the potential importance of the development of electromagnetic cascades on the ebl / cmb to the interpretation of observations in the high energy ( he , @xmath16=100 @xmath17100 @xmath1 ) and the very high energy ( vhe , @xmath16=100 @xmath1100 @xmath7 ) ranges .",
    "this short paper does not pretend to claim great originality ; most of its basic ideas were already discussed and most of its main results were already presented in @xcite@xcite .",
    "soon after the discovery of the first @xmath7 extragalactic @xmath0-ray source @xcite , the first @xmath0-astronomical constraints on the ebl density were obtained @xcite@xcite , accounting for only the pair - production process as the main cause of transformation of the primary @xmath0-ray spectrum ( for very distant sources , it is necessary to include adiabatic losses ) .",
    "this model we call `` the absorption - only model '' . since 1993 , almost every year several papers appear , assuming the absorption - only model , sometimes at a rate of a dozen a year or more .      in what follows , any significant deviations from the absorption - only model are called `` anomalies '' , even if they do not fall beyond the conventional physics .",
    "several such anomalies were reported @xcite@xcite , with a statistical significance not overwhelming in every single case , but together they indicate that the absorption - only model is incomplete and must be modified in some way ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "secondary electrons and positrons ( hereafter simply `` electrons '' ) produced in the @xmath4 process radiate cascade @xmath0-rays by means of the inverse compton ( ic ) process ; these @xmath0-rays may contribute to the observable spectrum of an extragalactic source .",
    "therefore , besides the properties of background photon fields ( ebl / cmb ) , another very important factor is the strength and structure of the extragalactic magnetic field ( egmf ) .",
    "some selected constraints on the egmf strength @xmath18 in voids of the large scale structure ( lss ) , most of them assuming correlation length of the field @xmath19= 1 @xmath20 , are shown in figure  [ f1 ] .",
    "there are two regions of @xmath18 values that satisfy most of these constraints : @xmath21 @xmath222@xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath223@xmath26 @xmath24 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the absorption - only model regime : for such a strong egmf secondary electrons are , as a rule , strongly deflected and delayed so that cascade photons do not contribute to the point - like image of the source . on the other hand , for the case of the second option",
    "such a contribution is still possible , at least in the vhe energy range .",
    "the lower bound on the @xmath18 value , @xmath25 @xmath24 , is highly uncertain @xcite-@xcite . very recently",
    "a paper @xcite appeared , disfavouring a narrow range of values around @xmath18= @xmath21 @xmath24 for @xmath19= 1 @xmath20 .",
    "let us assume for a moment the following simple two - phase model of the egmf .",
    "lss voids with @xmath27 fill a fraction of the total volume @xmath28 , while the rest is occupied by the comparatively strong ( @xmath29 @xmath24 ) egmf with @xmath30 @xmath20 .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows several fits to the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazar 1es 0229 + 200 ( @xcite for the four lowest - energy bins shown in black and @xcite for other bins ) assuming this model with various values of @xmath31 .",
    "cascade component dominates at low energies ( @xmath32300500 @xmath1 ) .",
    "details of simulations correspond to the case of figure 15 of @xcite .",
    "reasonable fits in the energy range 30 @xmath1 10 @xmath7 may be obtained for the case of @xmath31 between 0.4 and 0.6 .",
    "however , below 30 @xmath1 the model intensity exceeds the observed one .",
    "this may be explained either by the deflection and/or delay of cascade electrons while travelling the egmf @xcite@xcite or by additional ( with respect to ic ) electron energy losses @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] depicts the main spectral signatures of the electromagnetic ( em ) cascade model : 1 ) high - energy cutoff , similar to the absorption - only model , 2 ) an ankle at the intersection of the primary and cascade components ( in fact , this signature is also visible in figure  [ f2 ] ) , 3 ) a low - energy cutoff for the case of a non - zero egmf value ( `` magnetic cutoff '' ) , and 4 ) a `` second ankle '' at the low - energy region of the spectrum .",
    "we argue that all above - mentioned anomalies may be interpreted within the framework of the em cascade model , namely : + 1 .",
    "the apparent excess of observed @xmath0-rays in the highest - energy bins claimed in @xcite@xcite was discussed by @xcite .",
    "a prominent ankle ( signature 2 in figure  [ f3 ] ) may account for this effect .",
    "the unusual spectral hardening towards lower energies @xcite is explained by the existence of a `` magnetic cutoff '' ( signature 3 in figure  [ f3 ] ) , as the authors of @xcite themselves note ( however , see @xcite and @xcite itself for other possible explanations ) .",
    "the same spectral feature ( a prominent magnetic cutoff ) may account for the result of @xcite , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ 4 . finally",
    ", `` halos '' observed around some blazars also may be explained in the context of the em cascade model @xcite .",
    "+ thus , the em cascade model appears to be the simplest extragalactic @xmath0-ray propagation scenario that coherently explains all these anomalies .",
    "other , more exotic models that could account for a part of these anomalies do exist @xcite@xcite ; the main difficulties of these scenarios were discussed by us in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recent observations of some blazars in the 1 @xmath1  10 @xmath7 energy region seem to indicate that the secondary component of cascade @xmath0-rays may constitute a considerable contribution to the observable flux in the @xmath331500 @xmath1 energy range .",
