    "the overwhelming majority of hadronic states in the particle data group s collection are hadron excitations @xcite .",
    "qcd as the theory of strong interactions should give the whole spectrum of hadrons , based on the few quark mass parameters and a scale .",
    "so far , the lattice regularized form of qcd provides the only known way to perform ab - initio calculations of these observables .",
    "only recently there have been lattice calculations with dynamical quark masses close to their physical values ; most calculations still rely on extrapolations from unphysically heavy quarks .",
    "a reliable determination of the excited states still remains a hard challenge .",
    "the present calculation is another step in this enterprise .    for decades a lattice realization of chiral symmetry has been an obstacle ; quite early it was observed @xcite that a solution might be dirac operators obeying an non - linear relation , the so - called ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) condition , overlooked for many years .",
    "meanwhile we know several dirac operators obeying that condition . one of them , the overlap operator @xcite , has an explicit construction based on a domain - wall approach @xcite in the limit of infinite extent of a fifth dimension .",
    "another formulation ( perfect fermions ) is formally exact @xcite , but , like other approaches , can be constructed only in an approximate version @xcite .",
    "the lattice version of chiral symmetry underlying the gw relation has been given in @xcite .",
    "gw - dirac operators are numerically expensive to construct but have nice properties like protection from additive mass renormalization or automatic @xmath5 improvement .    due to the construction method , which , e.g. , in the case of overlap fermion , involves computation of an operator sign function , simulations with dynamical gw - fermions are very expensive , typically two orders of magnitude more expensive than simulations with the simple , improved wilson dirac operator . a problem especially apparent for gw - fermions concerns tunneling between different topological sectors .",
    "due to the atiyah - singer theorem we know that topological sectors of the gauge configurations are related to the net number of exact zero modes of the dirac operator ( counted according to their chirality signature ) .",
    "the so - called chirally improved ( ci ) dirac operator is an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation @xcite .",
    "its construction is based on a formal parameterization of the dirac operator inserted in the gw - equation and solved in truncated from .",
    "this fermion action has already been used extensively in simulations by the bgr - collaboration in the quenched approximation .",
    "it was found that at least in quenched simulations the @xmath6 corrections for baryon masses are small @xcite and that renormalization constants behave similar to an exact chirally symmetric action @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present results of dynamical simulations with two mass - degenerate light quarks using this action .",
    "the parametrization , as well as details of the simulation and some early results are given in @xcite .",
    "the small discretization errors allow us to use rather coarse lattices in order to save computational costs .    here",
    "we discuss the results concerning several meson and baryon masses derived on the gauge field configurations of @xcite .",
    "we present results of ground states as well as excited states , making use of the variational method @xcite .",
    "in addition to the light ( dynamical and valence ) quarks we also consider another , heavier valence ( strange ) quark and include the strange mesons and baryons in our analysis . with the presently available data",
    "we neither perform a continuum limit nor an infinite volume limit .",
    "this may be justified considering the small discretization errors and that our values for @xmath7 should be large enough to expect small finite volume effects due to the pion cloud .",
    "however , in addition to pions `` wrapping around the universe '' , finite volume effects can appear when considering large hadrons which may not `` fit in the box '' .",
    "a possible interpretation of our results involves such squeezing effects in case of the excited baryons .",
    "motivated empirically , extrapolation to the physical pion mass is performed naively , with a fit linear in the pion mass squared .",
    "preliminary results have been presented in @xcite .",
    "recent results on light and strange hadron spectroscopy with focus on excited states following different approaches can be found in @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on results for hadron masses from dynamical ci - simulation and is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ simdetsec ] we review the setup and parameters of the simulation , followed by the discussion of the methods to extract hadron masses in sect . [ methods ] .",
    "extrapolation to physical quark masses and sources for systematic errors are discussed in sect .",
    "[ syseffects ] . in sections [ resultslight ] and [ resultsstrange ] we then present our results on hadron masses .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we use the chirally improved dirac ( @xmath8 ) operator @xcite ; this is an approximate solution to the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "it is obtained by insertion of the most general ansatz for a dirac operator into the gw equation and comparison of the coefficients .",
    "this leads to an algebraic set of coupled equations , which can be solved numerically .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of terms included after the truncation , in our case considering paths to neighbors up to a maximum path length of 4 lattice units .",
    "the paths and coefficients used are found in the appendix of @xcite . in principle",
    ", one could optimize the coefficients in the parametrization for each gauge coupling and quark mass value with respect to chiral symmetry .",
    "however , defining the setup this way , the predictive power of the simulation is weakened , and , furthermore , comparison of different sets of gauge ensembles is more complicated .",
    "we therefore decided to use the same paths and coefficients in all our dynamical runs and thus the bare dirac operator is the same in all discussed ensembles .",
    "this leads to additive mass renormalization which is corrected for by determining the pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) mass , also called awi ( axial ward identity ) mass for each ensemble .",
    "we include one level of stout smearing @xcite as part of the definition of @xmath8 in order to improve the fermion action further .",
    "the parameters of stout smearing are adjusted such that the value of the plaquette is maximized ( @xmath9 in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we generate the dynamical configurations with a hybrid monte - carlo ( hmc ) algorithm @xcite , with the implementation for @xmath8 described in @xcite .",
    "performance improvement is obtained by hasenbusch mass preconditioning @xcite with two pseudofermions .",
    "further improvement is achieved by the use of a chronological inverter by minimal residue extrapolation @xcite and a mixed precision inverter @xcite .",
    "a discussion of the autocorrelation time , the eigenvalues of the dirac operator and the topological sector of the generated configurations is found in @xcite .",
    "we choose to analyze every fifth configuration and neglect any remaining weak correlations .",
    "the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath8 indicates that we may simulate small pion masses on relatively coarse lattices .",
    "the algorithm was found to show frequent tunneling through topological sectors .",
    "the gauge configurations are determined on an sgi altix-4700 ( a machine with a peak rate of 62.3 tflop / s for 9728 processors ) using for each configuration ( i.e. , one unit of hmc - time ) a total amount ( summed over the processors used in parallel ) of @xmath10 cpuh for set a and up to @xmath11 cpuh for set c. the quark propagators for the analysis are computed with a multi - mass solver and thus the cpu time depends only on the smallest ( the dynamical ) quark mass .",
    "computing the quark propagators for one configuration and 60 sources ( five source types , cf .",
    "[ quarksourcesmearing ] and 12 dirac - color sources each ) takes approximately the same amount of cpu time as for generating one gauge configuration . a recent comparison for different actions",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use lattices of size @xmath0 at three different values of the gauge coupling @xmath12 and bare quark mass parameter @xmath13 , see table [ simdettab ] .",
    "the lattice spacing is determined via the static quark potential , using a sommer parameter of @xmath14 fm .",
    "the bare simulation parameters are chosen such that the lattice spacing is of approximately the same magnitude in all three ensembles .",
    "hence their physical volume is of the same size as well ( @xmath15 fm ) .",
