    "a striking property of the nonlinear perturbative qcd approaches for high energy deep inelastic electron - proton ( or electron - nucleus ) scattering ( dis ) is the geometric scaling phenomenon . in the parton saturation based framework ,",

    "such a scaling is exact asymptotic solution of a general class of nonlinear evolution equations @xcite and it is a universal property of them . in particular , it corresponds to the traveling wave solutions of those equations .",

    ", it extends towards relatively large virtualities , @xmath9 , provided one stays in small-@xmath5 region . for nuclear targets , that kinematic window is further enlarged due to the nuclear enhancement of the saturation scale , @xmath10 .",

    "the starting point in the derivation of our scaling formula for the exclusive cross section for the process , @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , is the eikonal model in the impact parameter space @xcite . the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath48 in general is assumed to be purely imaginary and the @xmath49-channel unitarity implies that @xmath50 . in the eikonal approach , @xmath51 , where the eikonal @xmath52 is a real function .",

    "the @xmath61 and @xmath54 parameters absorbed the oversimplification of using a photon wave - function overlap @xmath62 within the color dipole framework .",
    "therefore , we will construct the scaling function for describing exclusive diffractive processes starting from eq .",
    "( [ sigel ] ) .",
    "the main point is to associate the exclusive vector meson production and dvcs process as a quasi - elastic scattering .    for vector meson production",

    "the photon splits into a dipole of transverse size @xmath63 and longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath64 which scatters elastically off the target ( proton or nucleus ) , with virtuality @xmath6 and recombines into a vector meson of mass @xmath65 or real photon of zero virtuality , @xmath66 . specifically for the former process",

    "tab : chi ] , the quality of fit is very good even for fit 2 which considers only two parameters and @xmath107 .",
    "it is interesting the stability of parameters @xmath61 and @xmath54 in both cases and the proximity with the values obtained for the inclusive case @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite ( deviation of @xmath108% ) .    in fig .",

    "the corresponding @xmath109 for the @xmath20 case is better using fit 2 than fit 1 , which includes the recent data from desy - hera .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath54 have sizable difference from the other cases and the origin of such a discrepancy should be treated in a deeper study as the @xmath20 meson is in the transition region between light to heavy mesons . on the other hand ,",

    "the main features from the scaling curve can be traced from the asymptotic limit of eq .",

    "the geometric scaling present in the lepton - proton cross sections for exclusive processes , as quantified by eq .",
    "( [ sigexcl ] ) , is translated to the scattering on nuclear targets at high energies . following the same arguments given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the atomic number dependence is absorbed in the nuclear saturation scale and on the overall normalization related to the nuclear radius .",
    "therefore , the cross section for lepton - nuclei scattering takes the following form , @xmath114 where the scaling variable in nuclear case is @xmath115^{\\delta}$ ] .",
    "in particular , we expect that for large @xmath116 the relation is @xmath117 .",
    "as the current data on nuclear targets are quite scarce at small-@xmath5 region , the scaling formula above can be tested in future measurements in eics or in ultraperipheral heavy ions collisions .",
    "the robustness of the geometric scaling treatment for the interaction is quite impressive and similar scaling properties has been proved theoretically and experimentally for instance in charged hadron production @xcite and on prompt photon production @xcite on @xmath118 and @xmath119 collisions in colliders energy regime .",
    "still discussing the nuclear case , the fitted values for the @xmath54 parameter have strong consequences for the role played by the nuclear shadowing for the distinct final states we have considered here . as defined in @xcite , the relation between the nuclear saturation scale , @xmath120 , and the proton one , @xmath121 , is given by , @xmath122^{\\delta } , \\,\\,\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\delta } = 0.79\\pm 0.02,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies that the small-@xmath5 data on nuclear structure functions @xmath123 favor an enhancement of the nuclear saturation scale faster than the usual @xmath124 estimation .",
    "moreover , the coincidence of the @xmath54 and @xmath125 parameters in the inclusive case indicates absence of shadowing in the nuclear parton distributions at @xmath126 .",
    "we see that the situation is different in the exclusive case . for instance",
    ", for dvcs at high @xmath6 and for electroproduction of @xmath21 the parameter @xmath54 is still similar to the inclusive case . on the contrary , for the light @xmath19 meson",
    "the deviation is quite large , where @xmath127 .",
    "this indicates that a study for the value of @xmath125 parameter in a electron - ion collider is quite important .",
    "probably , its value for exclusive processes in @xmath23 interactions should be larger than for the inclusive case allowing for a strong nuclear shadowing even for milder values of photon virtualities .",
    "this work demonstrates that assuming geometric scaling phenomenon in exclusive processes at small-@xmath5 and simple considerations on the scope of eikonal model , one is able to describe the available data dvcs an vector meson production on nucleon target with a universal scaling function without any further parameter .",
    "we establish that the geometric scaling parameterization can be extrapolated to nuclear targets to be tested in future eics or in ultra - peripheral collisions .",
