    "one of the most interesting features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the apparent discrepancy between the fundamental role of color as a conserved quantum number carried by quarks and gluons and the non - observation of color in physical hadronic states . as a non - perturbative phenomenon ,",
    "the confinement mechanism responsible for the color - singlet nature of hadrons is still not fully understood .",
    "one can hope to gain more insight by studying the relatively simple bound states of heavy charm and bottom quarks , such as @xmath0 or @xmath4 mesons .",
    "ever since qcd emerged as the fundamental theory of the strong interaction , models have been designed to explain the compensation of color in heavy quarkonia .",
    "well - known examples are the color evaporation @xcite and hard comover scattering models @xcite , which assume that color is restored by soft and hard gluon exchange with the underlying event , respectively , and the color singlet model ( csm ) @xcite , which requires the heavy quark pair to be produced in a color singlet state .",
    "the csm leads to strong selection rules and connects the production cross section with the quarkonium wave function .",
    "today , a rigorous effective field theory exists in the form of non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , which utilizes a double expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath5 and the relative quark - antiquark velocity @xmath6 in order to factorize the hard production from the soft binding process @xcite .",
    "left - over singularities in the csm can be removed systematically into non - perturbative color - octet operator matrix elements ( omes ) , and their numerical values can be fitted to describe the hadroproduction cross sections observed at the tevatron .",
    "however , it is necessary to demonstrate the universality of these omes in other production processes , such as @xmath1 collisions .",
    "since the theoretical uncertainties from scale variations in leading order ( lo ) of @xmath5 are quite substantial , it is furthermore important to include also contributions from next - to - leading order ( nlo ) virtual loop and real emission processes . in this paper",
    ", we report on recent progress along these lines .",
    "in direct @xmath1 collisions , @xmath0 mesons with mass @xmath7 and finite transverse momentum @xmath8 are produced in association with either a photon ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] )    or a jet , where the final state photon in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] has to be replaced by a gluon . in the first case , the physical color - singlet state ( @xmath9}$ ] in spectroscopic notation )",
    "is produced directly , whereas in the second case the intermediate color - octet state ( @xmath10}$ ] ) transforms into the physical @xmath0 through soft gluon emission .",
    "although the strong coupling of the hard gluon enhances the second process , it is strongly suppressed by the relevant color - octet ome , which is subleading in @xmath6 . in nlo of @xmath5 , an unresolved dijet system with invariant mass @xmath11 , originating from two gluons or a light quark - antiquark pair ,",
    "allows for the production of intermediate @xmath12}$ ] , @xmath10}$ ] , and @xmath13}$ ] states . at small @xmath8 ,",
    "virtual loop corrections have to be included to cancel the unphysical dependence on the cut - off @xmath14 , but at large @xmath8 these contributions become unimportant . as can be observed clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the    cut - off dependence is reduced and the corrections from real particle emission become large @xcite . at small @xmath8 , one does , however , not expect large radiative corrections , as has also been shown in a full nlo calculation for direct color - singlet @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 production in @xmath1 collisions proceeds not only through direct interactions of photons with charm quarks , but also through resolved processes , where one or two of the photons emit quarks and gluons which then interact with the heavy quarks . in the small-@xmath8 range recently studied by the delphi experiment at cern lep2 @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 production is dominated by the single - resolved process @xmath15 , where one initial state photon and the final state photon in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] have to be replaced with gluons .",
    "in addition , processes with non - abelian coupling of the gluons and processes involving light quarks have to be taken into account using the relevant color - octet omes .",
    "furthermore , contributions from @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays have to be included , whereas those from @xmath16 meson decays are suppressed by the small branching fraction .",
    "the differential cross section of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes a generic charmonium state , can be written as @xmath19\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & & { } \\times d\\sigma(ab\\to c\\overline{c}[n]+d ) , \\label{e1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the equivalent number of transverse photons radiated by the initial - state positrons and electrons @xcite , @xmath21 are the pdfs of the photon , @xmath22\\rangle$ ] are the omes of the @xmath18 meson , @xmath23+d)$ ] are the differential partonic cross sections , the integrals are over the longitudinal - momentum fractions of the emitted particles w.r.t .  the emitting ones ,",
    "and it is summed over @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 . to leading order in @xmath6 , we need to include the @xmath27 fock states @xmath28},{}^1\\!s_0^{[8]},{}^3\\!s_1^{[8]},{}^3\\!p_j^{[8]}$ ] if @xmath29 and @xmath30},{}^3\\!s_1^{[8]}$ ] if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . with the definition @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) accommodates the direct , single - resolved , and double - resolved channels .    in our numerical analysis",
    ", we use @xmath34  gev , @xmath35 , and the lo formula for @xmath36 with @xmath37 active quark flavors . as for the photon pdfs",
    ", we use the lo set from glck , reya , and schienbein ( grs ) @xcite , which is the only available one that is implemented in the fixed - flavor - number scheme , with @xmath37 .",
    "we choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , where @xmath40 is the transverse mass of the @xmath0 meson , and independently vary the scale parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 between 1/2 and 2 about the default value 1 . as for the @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 omes",

    "@xcite ) . in the first ( second ) case",
    ", we employ @xmath43  mev ( 224  mev ) , which corresponds to @xmath44  mev @xcite ( 192  mev @xcite ) , so as to conform with the fit @xcite .",

    "in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainties in our predictions , we vary the unphysical parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath50 as indicated above , take into account the experimental errors on @xmath55 , the decay branching fractions , and the default omes , and switch from our default ome set to the cteq5l one , properly adjusting @xmath56 . we then combine the individual shifts in quadrature , allowing for the upper and lower half - errors to be different .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we confront the @xmath57 distribution of @xmath58 measured by delphi @xcite with our nrqcd and csm predictions .",
    "the solid lines and shaded bands represent the central results , evaluated with our default settings , and their uncertainties , respectively .",
    "we observe that the delphi data clearly favors the nrqcd prediction , while it significantly overshoots the csm one @xcite .",
    "in summary , the production of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath1 collisions allows for a test of factorization in color - octet processes as predicted by nrqcd and observed at the tevatron .",
    "we have calculated the contributions from direct and resolved photons to @xmath0 mesons produced directly or from @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays .",
    "our nrqcd predictions are nicely confirmed by recent data from the delphi collaboration at cern lep2 , whereas the csm prediction is clearly disfavored .",
