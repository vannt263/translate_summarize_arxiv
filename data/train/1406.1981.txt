    "given a homogeneous polynomial @xmath14 in @xmath15 variables of degree @xmath1 over a field @xmath3 , its clifford algebra @xmath16 is defined to be the quotient of the free associative @xmath3-algebra @xmath17 by the ideal generated by the elements @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "this definition was introduced by roby in @xcite .",
    "it generalizes the classical notion of the clifford algebra of a quadratic space .",
    "if the quadratic space is regular , its clifford algebra is known to be a tensor product of quaternion algebras over @xmath3 if the dimension is even or over a quadratic extension of @xmath3 if the dimension is odd ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    the clifford algebra is invariant under linear change of variables , and therefore it is used for classifying homogeneous polynomials .",
    "another use of the clifford algebras is in the study of central simple algebras . given a central simple algebra @xmath20 that contains an @xmath3-vector subspace @xmath21 such that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , the subalgebra @xmath24 $ ] of @xmath20 is a representation of the clifford algebra @xmath16 where @xmath25 for some fixed basis @xmath26 of @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the representations of the clifford algebras , and in particular their simple images , are of great importance .    the case of @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "was first considered by heerema in @xcite .",
    "haile studied these algebras in the series of papers @xcite .",
    "he showed that in characteristic not @xmath27 or @xmath28 , if the binary cubic form @xmath29 is nondegenerate , @xmath16 is an azumaya algebra of rank 9 , whose center is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the affine elliptic curve @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the discriminant of @xmath29 .",
    "hence the simple homomorphic images of @xmath16 are cyclic algebras of degree @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , there is a one - to - one correspondence between galois orbits of points on that affine elliptic curve and the simple homomorphic images of @xmath16 .",
    "the induced mapping from the group of @xmath3-rational points on the elliptic curve described above with the point at infinity as unity to the brauer group of @xmath3 is a group homomorphism with image the relative brauer group of the function field of the curve @xmath32 given by @xmath33 .",
    "finally , he proved that @xmath16 is split if and only if the curve @xmath32 has an @xmath3-rational point .    on the other hand ,",
    "irreducible representations of clifford algebras were studied in papers such as @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath29 is nondegenerate and @xmath3 is an infinite field , the dimension of any representation of @xmath16 is divisible by the degree of @xmath29 . in the case where @xmath3 is algebraically closed of characteristic 0 , van den bergh in @xcite",
    "showed that the equivalence classes of @xmath34-dimensional representations of @xmath16 are in one - to - one correspondence with isomorphism classes of certain vector bundles ( later known as ulrich bundles ) of rank @xmath35 on the hypersurface in @xmath36 given by the equation @xmath37 .",
    "advanced results on representations of clifford algebras were recently derived in @xcite via the study of the ulrich bundles on the geometric side of this correspondence .    in @xcite ,",
    "pappacena generalized the notion of the clifford algebra to the algebra associated to a monic polynomial ( with respect to the first variable ) over @xmath3 of the form @xmath0 where each @xmath38 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath39 .",
    "this algebra , denoted there by @xmath40 , is defined to be the quotient of the free associative @xmath3-algebra @xmath41 by the ideal generated by the elements @xmath42 for all @xmath19 .",
    "the algebra @xmath43 is called the generalized clifford algebra of the monic polynomial @xmath44 .",
    "pappacena proved in that paper that if @xmath45 then this generalized clifford algebra is isomorphic to the classical clifford algebra of a quadratic form , and therefore its structure is known .",
    "however , he said little when @xmath46 .    in @xcite",
    ", kuo studied the generalized clifford algebra of the monic polynomial @xmath47 in characteristic not 2 or 3 and derived the results very similar to those obtained by haile when @xmath44 is absolutely irreducible .",
    "in particular , @xmath43 is an azumaya algebra of rank 9 and its center is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of an affine elliptic curve whose closure in @xmath48 is the jacobian of the cubic curve given by @xmath49 .",
    "this result was recently applied in @xcite to solving a problem about @xmath50 cubes , which relates to the computation of the cassels - tate pairing on the 3-selmer group of an elliptic curve over a number field .",
    "these generalized clifford algebras with @xmath51 were also used in @xcite , where the reducible case was fully understood , to classify hyperbolic planes in the space of reduced trace zero elements in a division algebra of degree three into three basic types .",
    "the contents of this paper are structured as follows . in section [ evd ]",
    "we present the basic tool , namely the eigenvector decomposition , which enables us to obtain the results in the following sections . in section [ seccharnot3 ]",

    "the formulas for the simple homomorphic images provided in this section fill the gap that was left open in @xcite , where formulas were provided only in the case of @xmath53 . in section [ secchar3 ] , we study the generalized clifford algebra of the monic polynomial @xmath47 in characteristic @xmath28 .",
