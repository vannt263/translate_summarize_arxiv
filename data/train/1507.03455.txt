    "the presence of the tiny neutrino masses and mixings between different neutrino flavors have been established by many neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite , while more and more evidences are accumulated for the existence of dark matter ( dm ) over the last several decades , with the most precise measurement of its relic abundance by planck  @xcite .",

    "<S> we propose a new model with the majorana neutrino masses generated at two - loop level , in which the lepton number violation ( lnv ) processes , such as neutrinoless double beta decays , are mainly induced by the dimension-7 lnv effective operator @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is necessary to impose an @xmath1 symmetry in order that @xmath2 dominates over the conventional dimension-5 weinberg operator , which naturally results in a stable @xmath1-odd neutral particle to be the cold dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , due to the non - trivial dependence of the charged lepton masses , the model predicts the neutrino mass matrix to be in the form of the normal hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> we also focus on a specific parameter region of great phenomenological interests , such as electroweak precision tests , dark matter direct searches along with its relic abundance , and lepton flavor violation processes . </S>"
