    "we consider a system of @xmath1 interacting fermions in a finite volume .",
    "since we want to avoid the surface effects , we actually consider the fermions moving on toruses and spheres , or , more generally , on a closed riemann manifold @xmath2 of finite volume @xmath3 .",
    "according to the kohn - sham theory @xcite ( and later extensions @xcite ) , the particle density at thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is a solution of the following set of equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 with @xmath8 an effective potential depending entirely on the particle density @xmath9 and @xmath10 determined from @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the single particle , non - interacting hamiltonian .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the kohn - sham hamiltonian , where we introduced the coupling constant @xmath14 for convenience .",
    "we will neglect the spin degree of freedom .",
    "there is no closed form of @xmath8 .",
    "however , at least for the electron gas , there is a set of very successful , explicit approximations , which already provide numerical results that are within the so called `` chemical precision '' @xcite .",
    "although in this paper we do not use a specific approximation , we will often make reference to two such approximations in order to check our assumptions .",
    "they are the local density approximation ( lda ) : @xmath15 ( @xmath16 the two body interaction ) , i.e. @xmath8 is the sum between the hartree potential and a _ function _ of density , and the quadratic approximation ( qa ) : @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath8 is the convolution of the density with a certain kernel .",
    "the mathematical structure of qa is the same as that of the hartree approximation .    in this paper , we are not concerned with the physical and mathematical principles leading to the ks equations , but rather with the mathematical structure of these equations , in particular with the question of uniqueness at zero temperature . in other words",
    ", we have already assumed @xmath16-representability , picked our approximation for @xmath8 and we are ready to compute the self - consistent solutions .",
    "what should we expect ?",
    "well , as already demonstrated ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) , even for local approximations , we should expect a very rich structure , which may include multiple solutions , symmetry breaking etc .. while previous studies used purely numerical methods , here we use group theoretical methods and functional analysis to study this structure .",
    "let us discuss first what it is known about the ks equations at finite temperature and finite volume .",
    "the notation @xmath18 stands for @xmath19^{1/p}$ ] and @xmath20 means @xmath21 . assume the following :    a1 ) : :    @xmath12 is self adjoint , bounded from below ; for    @xmath22 below its energy spectrum , the kernel    @xmath23 is continuous ( with respect to    @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and    @xmath26 a2 ) : :    @xmath27 and    @xmath28 , where the supremum is    taken over all @xmath9 in    @xmath29    as @xmath12 is in general equal to minus the laplace operator , a1 is easy to check for 1 , 2 and 3 dimensional toruses or spheres .",
    "it fails in 4 and higher dimensions .",
    "since @xmath2 is of finite volume , a1 automatically implies that @xmath30 is trace class .",
    "a1 also implies that @xmath31 . together with a2 ( easy to verify for lda and qa @xcite ) , this leads to @xmath32 then , @xmath33 is self - adjoint for all @xmath34 and , as it follows from ref .",
    "@xcite , the kohn - sham equations can be formulated as a fixed point problem :    * theorem 1 . * for @xmath35 , the following map is well defined : @xmath36(x)=\\left(1+e^{\\beta(h_n-\\mu)}\\right)^{-1}(x , x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the unique solution of @xmath37 .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath38 generate all possible solutions of the ks equations .",
    "many will recognize in eq .",
    "( [ tmap ] ) the usual formulation of the ks problem in terms of the density matrix .",
    "when appealing to the fixed point theorem , the functional form of the map @xmath38 and its domain of definition are _ equally _ important .",
    "what is new in the above result is that @xmath38 is well defined for all densities which integrate to @xmath1 .",
    "apart from complications that may occur at low particle densities and which will not be addressed here , the following assumption can be easily verified for lda and qa ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    a3 ) : :    there exists @xmath39 such that    @xmath40 for any    @xmath9 , @xmath41 .",
    "if a1-a3 are satisfied , then there exists @xmath42 , which is a function of @xmath14 , such that @xcite @xmath43-\\textsf{t}[n^\\prime]\\|_{l^1}\\leq      \\kappa\\|n - n'\\|_{l^1},\\ ] ] on the entire @xmath44 . for @xmath14",
    "smaller than a critical value @xmath45 , @xmath38 becomes a contraction and , consequently , it has a unique fixed point . if the constants can be chosen independent of temperature in a1-a3 , it is not hard to show that @xmath45 increases with temperature . in other words , if @xmath14 is kept fixed , a1-a3 ( and the fact that @xmath3 is finite ) guaranties the existence of a unique fixed point of @xmath38 at high temperatures .",
    "let us end the finite temperature case with a few remarks .",
    "for an exact @xmath8 , the existence and uniqueness , at any finite @xmath4 , will follow from the convexity of the functional @xcite , provided that the equilibrium density can be written as in eq .",
    "( [ ks2 ] ) ( i.e. is @xmath16-representable ) . in practice",
    ", we do nt have the exact @xmath8 and @xmath16-representability has not been yet proved or disproved .",
    "also , in the thermodynamic limit , where systems can have multiple coexisting phases , the issue of uniqueness becomes more delicate and definitely there are many opened questions here .",
    "thus , the question of existence and uniqueness in the finite temperature kohn - sham equations is not trivial .",
    "the situation at zero temperature is more delicate .",
    "the density now becomes @xmath46 where the sum goes over the lowest @xmath1 energy states of @xmath33 .",
    "if the last occupied energy level is degenerate and only partially occupied , there is an ambiguity in defining @xmath47 . in this paper , we deal exactly with this situation .",
    "let us assume that that there is a continuous group @xmath48 acting ergodically on @xmath2 and preserving the riemann structure .",
    "on torus or sphere , this group will be simply the translations or rotations .",
    "let us consider the natural unitary representation of @xmath48 in @xmath49 : @xmath50 we assume that @xmath12 commutes with all @xmath51 and that every symmetry of the particle density is automatically a symmetry of the effective potential :    a4 ) : :    if @xmath52 , then @xmath53    ( equivalently @xmath54 ) .",
    "this assumption can be easily verified for lda and qa . besides other things , a4 implies that @xmath8 is a constant if @xmath47 is uniform , and we can fix this constant to zero . in other words , the kohn - sham hamiltonian reduces to @xmath12 if @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "then , it is trivial to show that , at any finite temperature , @xmath57 is a solution of the ks equations . with our assumptions",
    ", we also know that this is the only solution at high temperatures . at zero temperature , assume that , if we populate with @xmath1 particles the energy levels of @xmath12 , from smaller to higher energies , we end up with @xmath58 particles on the last occupied energy level , assumed @xmath59-fold degenerate with @xmath60 .",
    "we refer to this level and its energy as the fermi level and fermi energy @xmath61 .",
    "if we can find @xmath58 states at the fermi level so as to generate a uniform particle density , then @xmath57 is a solution of the ks equations . if there is no such combination of states , than either there is no solution , the solution is not uniform or we need to consider fractional occupation numbers .",
    "we will not discuss here the last possibility , but rather concentrate to the @xmath62 limit of eqs .",
    "( [ ks1 ] ) and ( [ ks2 ] ) .",
    "we now show when and how the non - uniform solutions can be found .",
    "we look for a finite subgroup @xmath63 of @xmath48 , which has to satisfy two simple conditions .",
    "we index its irreducible representations by @xmath64 and use the symbol @xmath65 to specify their dimension .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the projectors @xmath67 with the following properties @xmath68 above , @xmath69 denotes the cardinal of @xmath63 and @xmath70 the character of @xmath71 in the representation @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath72 denote the eigenspace of @xmath12 corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "this space is invariant to @xmath48 and it decomposes according to the irreducible representations of @xmath63 : @xmath73 .",
    "the sum goes only over those @xmath64 for which @xmath74 .",
    "in general , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the number of representations @xmath77 on @xmath72 . the subgroup @xmath63 we look for must satisfy the following :    a5 ) : :    @xmath78 , i.e. we have    irreducible representations of @xmath63 in each    @xmath79 .",
    "a6 ) : :    @xmath80 for some @xmath81 ( we rearrange so    that @xmath82 ) .",
    "let now @xmath83 be the particle density when we populate all the states of @xmath12 below @xmath61 plus the @xmath58 states in @xmath84 . since we assumed that @xmath85 , @xmath83 is not uniform .",
    "the last condition is on the effective potential :    a7 ) : :    if @xmath86 with    @xmath87 any norm one vector from    @xmath88 , then    @xmath89    if the subgroup @xmath63",
    "satisfying a5-a6 exists and the effective potential satisfies a7 , then , at least for small @xmath14 , the zero temperature ks equations have a non - uniform solution , @xmath90 this is our main result .",
    "we end our long introduction with a discussion of the conditions a5-a7 .",
    "the assumption a5 greatly simplifies our proof , but it is not essential ( though we do nt have a proof without a5 ) .",
    "a6 assures the closed shell condition and is essential .",
    "it can be relaxed , for example , we can have two completely filled shells . however , we believe that , in the ground state configuration , all @xmath58 particles occupied the same ( lowest ) energy level .",
    "condition a7 refers to the effective potential and it requires , quite naturally , that the level populated by the @xmath58 particles to have the lowest energy ( in the first order in @xmath14 ) .",
    "we believe a7 is essential .",
    "now , even if we find the correct @xmath63 , a7 may not be satisfied , since there is a competition between the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials . for repulsive interactions ,",
    "the exchange - correlation potential must dominate the hartree potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ a7 ] ) ) .",
    "this is why the electrons crystallize at low densities . for attractive interactions ( like the lenard - jones fermions )",
    "is viceversa , the hartree term has to dominate the exchange - correlation .",
    "to conclude , a5-a6 determines the crystal structure and a7 determines the conditions , like the range of densities , in which this structure is stable .",
    "the idea behind our proof is the following .",
    "we restrict the search for @xmath47 to the densities that are symmetric relative to @xmath63 , and in a small vicinity of @xmath91 . under the action of @xmath8 ,",
    "the fermi level splits into sub - levels , and for @xmath14 small enough , we show that , for all densities in this vicinity , there are exactly @xmath1 states below @xmath61 .",

    "the self - consistent field will split the fourth energy level , so we can accommodate another pair of electrons without breaking the symmetry , i.e. the crystal with 10 electrons should also have square symmetry .",
    "examining either fig .  2 or the inset of fig .  3 ( where one can see the splitting of the second energy level ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , it follows that , in reality , there is a slight deviation from the @xmath211 symmetry .",
    "we can summarize our procedure as follows ( hopefully this can be seen in the above examples ) : in the first part , one looks for @xmath91 , which must be a good approximation of the self - consistent density . the main goal is to fulfill the closed shell condition and group theoretical methods can be used to accomplish that .",
    "after @xmath91 is found , one can construct the map @xmath38 in a neighborhood of @xmath91 . in the second part , one investigates if @xmath38 is indeed a contraction near @xmath91 . for small @xmath14 ,",
    "the conditions in which this is true are already given here .",
    "how large this @xmath14 can be depends on @xmath8 and its derivative near @xmath91 .",
    "one important remark is that some of these non - uniform solutions can be found only if we start the iteration close enough to them .",
    "the reason is that the basin of attraction of the map @xmath38 may be small ( notice that the usual iterative process of solving ks equations consists exactly in constructing the sequence @xmath91 , @xmath218 $ ] , @xmath219 , @xmath220 $ ] , etc . ) .",
    "for this reason , there may be additional isomers to the ones found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as opposed to the jahn - teller effect @xcite or pierls instability @xcite , which involves discrete symmetries and the electronic degeneracies",
    "are lifted by a displacement of the atoms , the symmetry breaking discussed here involves a continuous group and is due solely to the electron - electron interaction , which lifts the electronic degeneracies without any change in the external potential .",
    "the jahn - teller and pierls instabilities may be triggered ( but not necessarily ) by the instability we discussed here .",
    "our analysis does not rule out the existence of more than one self - consistent solution of the ks equations .",
    "the lowest energy configuration is , of course , associated with the ground state , and the higher energy configurations should be associated with excited states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors find that indeed , since the energy functional @xmath221 $ ] is not convex , @xmath221 $ ] may have additional extrema , which are excited - state densities .",
    "degeneracy and symmetry breaking in dft are well studied concepts in density functional theory @xcite , and there are many numerical studies on the subject . in fact , the modern theory of freezing @xcite , which can be traced back to the pioneering work of ramakrishnan and yussouff @xcite , is based on the assumption that the liquid - solid transitions occurs because of a bifurcation of the same type as we discussed here . more exactly , the density of the solid @xmath222 is computed self - consistently as the linear response of the uniform liquid density @xmath223 to the introduction of a density change @xmath224 . in the current state",
    ", the procedure can not predict the lattice symmetry , but rather assumes that the linear response equation has a non - uniform solution , with a prescribed crystalline symmetry ( usually known from experiment ) .",
    "applied to quantum liquids , this procedure is equivalent to solving the kohn - sham equations in the quadratic approximation .",
    "one can find in ref .",
    "@xcite an impressive numerical demonstration of the wigner crystallization of the electron liquid . for finite systems , we already mentioned refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we add refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also want to mention that bach et al @xcite have shown that , for any repulsive interaction , the energy levels are always fully occupied in the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this result automatically implies that there must be a symmetry breaking whenever the last occupied level of @xmath12 is only partially populated . in contradistinction ,",
    "@xcite showed that , within the hartree approximation ( 1d ) , there is always a symmetry breaking for short , attractive interactions .",
    "this definitely shows that we have to go beyond the two approximations .    at the end ,",
    "we want to mention that we have partial but interesting results in the thermodynamic limit and we are currently considering the finite temperature regime .",
    "we are also looking into the spin case , when the kohn - sham equations become self - consistent equations for the density @xmath47 and magnetization _ vector _ @xmath225 .",
