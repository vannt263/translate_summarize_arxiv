    "the derivation of fourier s law , or any other macroscopic law , from the microscopic underlying motion of particles constitutes a major task in condensed matter physics .",
    "this task comprises not only the derivation itself but also the problem of setting up the appropriate microscopic model . the simplest model one could conceive to derive fourier s law is a chain of particles interacting through harmonic potentials in contact with two heat reservoirs at each end .",
    "however , it has been shown by rieder et al @xcite that this model does not lead to fourier s law . since then , several microscopic models have been introduced and studied @xcite some of them leading instead to the so called anomalous fourier s law .",
    "fourier s law states that the heat flux @xmath0 is proportional to the gradient of the temperature @xmath1 , that is , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the heat conductivity . if we consider a small bar of length @xmath4 subject to a difference in temperature @xmath5 , then @xmath6 .",
    "thus a microscopic model for fourier s law should predict a heat flux that decreases with @xmath4 , for a fixed value of @xmath5 , according to @xmath7 this amounts to saying that @xmath3 is finite .",
    "if , instead , we find that @xmath8 with @xmath9 , then we are faced with the anomalous fourier s law . in this case",
    "we may say that @xmath3 is infinite , as in the harmonic chain @xcite , diverging according to @xmath10 , with exponent @xmath11 .",
    "notice that @xmath4 should be macroscopically small , so that equation ( [ 5 ] ) is the expression of fourier s law , but microscopically large so that a microscopic model for this law should yield equation ( [ 5 ] ) for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "the heat flux @xmath0 of the linear harmonic chain placed between two heat reservoirs has been shown @xcite to be independent of the size @xmath4 of the chain , meaning that the heat conductivity @xmath3 is infinite .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the ballistic transmission of heat by the elastic waves , from one reservoir to the other .",
    "a consequence of this result is that a perfectly harmonic crystal has an infinite heat conductivity @xcite . in real crystals",
    "the heat conductivity is manifestly finite .",
    "this is due to the presence of lattice imperfections , impurities , and other factors that act as scattering centers for the waves carrying energy , such as the umklapp process @xcite .",
    "these factors make the heat conduction a diffusion process which implies fourier s law .",
    "the crossover from ballistic do diffusive behavior can also be undertood in terms of the dephasing of the elastic waves caused by the scattering events just mentioned .",
    "this process is characterized by a dephasing length @xcite which , when smaller than the size of the system , gives the linear temperature profile expected from fourier s law .",
    "thus , a possible ingredient in the microscopic derivation of fourier s law consists in the presence of a diffusive motion at the microscopic level .",
    "one way of introducing this ingredient is by means of stochastic collisions that change the sign of the velocity of the particles .",
    "this can be accomplished in the form of impulsive shot noises with exponentially distributed waiting times @xcite .",
    "two key properties are required when devising such a noise .",
    "firstly , it should conserve the total energy of the system because any variation of the energy of the system should only be due to the contact with the heat reservoirs . changing the sign of the velocity",
    "does not alter the energy .",
    "secondly , it should make the system ergodic even when it is not coupled to the heat baths .",
    "a harmonic chain with this type of shot noise has been indeed studied by dhar et al @xcite .",
    "they showed that this model can be mapped into the self consistent harmonic crystal introduced by bolsteri et al @xcite , and studied by bonetto et al @xcite . in this model",
    "each particle is in contact with independent heat reservoirs , whose temperatures are chosen so that , in the steady state , there is no exchange of heat between these reservoirs and the chain .",
    "the contact with the reservoirs is regarded as a procedure to make the system ergodic @xcite .",
    "this model predicts a linear profile for the temperature and a finite heat conductivity , which is independent of temperature .",
    "here we study a chain of particles interacting through anharmonic forces in addition to random reversals of the velocity .",
    "more specifically we consider a potential with quartic terms in addition to the harmonic quadratic terms . without the stochastic shot noise",
    ", this is the well known fermi - pasta - ulam model in contact with heat reservoirs at its ends , which was studied numerically by lepri et al .",
    "@xcite who found a superdiffusive transport of heat implying an anomalous fourier s law",
    ". this important result has been confirmed by other numerical studies and other approaches @xcite the impulsive stochastic shot noise that we use here can be regarded as a procedure that turns the superdiffusive transport of heat into a diffuse transport leading thus to fourier s law .    by numerically solving the langevin equations for chains of several sizes , we determine the heat conductivity as a function of the system size @xmath4 and the rate of stochastic collisions @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath12 is nonzero , we obtain a finite heat conductivity and therefore fourier s law . for small values of @xmath12 ,",
    "the heat conductivity is found to behave as as @xmath13 , diverging when @xmath14 .",
    "our numerical results give @xmath15 .",
    "we have also determined the exponent @xmath16 related to the divergence of @xmath3 with @xmath4 at @xmath14 and found @xmath17 .",
    "these results are distinct from the harmonic case @xcite for which @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "also , in contrast to the harmonic case , we have found that the heat conductivity depends on temperature .",
    "more precisely , for a fixed @xmath5 , we found that it increases monotonically with the temperatures of the reservoirs .",
    "we consider a chain of @xmath4 interacting particles with equal masses @xmath20 and denote by @xmath21 the position of the @xmath22-th particle . the total potential energy @xmath23 )",
    "is considered to be a sum of anharmonic potential energies involving nearest - neighbor pairs of particles @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are parameters .",
    "we consider fixed boundary conditions so that @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 , the harmonic potential is recast .",
    "the force @xmath29 acting on the @xmath22-th particle due to the potential @xmath30 is @xmath31 @xmath32    the first and last particles are connected to heat baths at temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and all particles are susceptive to stochastic collisions , here described by forces @xmath35 . denoting by @xmath36 the velocity of the @xmath22-th particle , the equations of motion are stochastic equations given by @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is boltzmann constant and the last two terms in equations ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) represent the coupling to the heat reservoirs .",
    "the constant @xmath41 represents the strength of the coupling and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent gaussian white noises with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the forces @xmath35 have the form of impulsive shot noises , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 are uncorrelated exponentially distributed stochastic waiting times with a probability density distribution @xmath46 . here",
    ", the parameter @xmath12 is the rate of collisions , which has been taken to be the same for all particles . after a collision occurring at time @xmath47",
    ", the @xmath22-th particle changes its velocity from @xmath48 to @xmath49 , thus conserving its kinetic energy and therefore the total energy @xmath50    due to the contact with the reservoirs , the total energy @xmath51 is not a strictly conserved quantity . from the stochastic equations of motion we find @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the stationary state , @xmath55 is a constant and the sum of the fluxes @xmath56 and @xmath57 vanishes , that is , @xmath58 .",
    "the heat flux @xmath59 can be calculated as the average of the right - hand side of equation ( [ 13a ] ) or in a equivalent way from the equation @xmath60 which we found to be numerically more accurate than the formula @xmath61 .",
    "the stochastic equations of motion were solved numerically for chains of several sizes @xmath4 .",
    "this was done by discretizing the time in intervals @xmath62 .",
    "we use an approach in which the deterministic part of the equations of motion of the inner particles are handled by the use of the verlet algorithm @xcite so as to ensure that , in the absence of the heat baths , energy is conserved . for the equations of motion of the first and last particles , which contain the stochastic forces due to the heat baths , we used the stochastic verlet algorithm developed in @xcite .",
    "as for the stochastic shot noises we treat them as follows . at each time step",
    ", the sign of the velocity of each particle is changed with probability @xmath63 .",
    "this procedure generates a poisson process with discrete waiting time @xmath64 that is distributed according to the probability distribution @xmath65 . in the continuous time limit , @xmath66 ,",
    "this yields the exponential distribution @xmath67 , as required .    for definiteness ,",
    "our numerical calculations were performed with @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for the anharmonic potential",
    "all results reported in this paper were obtained for @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the size of the system ranged from @xmath74 up to @xmath75 .",
    "we also present numerical results for the harmonic case ( @xmath28 ) , for @xmath72 and compare with the results of the anharmonic case .",
    "the existing exact solution @xcite for harmonic case is used to check our numerical procedure .",
    "the exact solution is obtained by solving the equations for the pair correlations , which is possible because they consist of closed equations .",
    "however , this closure property does not happen for the anharmonic case .    in fig .",
    "[ vel ] we show the results for the average kinetic energy for each particle as a function of the position @xmath22 on the chain for the harmonic and anharmonic cases .",
    "the temperatures of the reservoirs are considered to be distinct , @xmath76 , and our numerical calculations were performed for @xmath77 and @xmath78 . without stochastic collisions ( @xmath14 ) the results of the harmonic case shows that the kinetic energy is almost constant , a result obtained by rieder et al @xcite , which does not lead to fourier s law .",
