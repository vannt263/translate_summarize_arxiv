    "the study of uncertainty relations has recently seen a major boost .",
    "one reason is certainly that more and more experiments reach quantum limited accuracy , so sharp quantitative bounds become more relevant .",
    "another is the realization the topic can not be reduced to the one relation ( by kennard @xcite ) proved in every textbook .",
    "three main directions of generalization are being pursued .",
    "the first is an extension of the set of scenarios to which quantitative uncertainty relations apply .",
    "the kennard relations is a `` preparation uncertainty relation '' , i.e. , a quantitative expression of the observation that there is no state preparation for which the distributions of two observables under consideration are both sharp .",
    "a more recent addition @xcite are `` measurement uncertainty relations '' which express the property that two observables can not be jointly measured , which also implies that an ( approximate ) measurement of one observable necessarily destroy the information about the other , and hence an error - disturbance tradeoff .",
    "these two are not the only possible scenarios .",
    "for example , there are also contexts of estimation theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) where uncertainty ideas are relevant .",
    "the second direction of generalization is in the concrete mathematical expressions measuring the `` sharpness '' of distributions , or the error of an approximate measurement .",
    "there are many choices here , depending on the problem at hand .",
    "to begin with there can be different metrics expressing the distance between measured outcomes .",
    "in information theory one is often not interested in the values assigned to the outcomes , but in non - parametric properties of their distribution , which leads to entropy and related quantities as a measure of sharpness .",
    "furthermore , standard deviation may a poor rendering of the concrete conditions in which the relation is applied : for the statement that a particle passed through a slit , i.e. , the lateral position is confined to an interval , a maximum norm on the deviation from the center will be much more adequate than a mean quadratic error .",
    "typically , all the variants of the deviation measures give relations with the same qualitative content , but the quantitative statement ( and the exact constants ) will differ .    finally , the third direction of generalization is the application to arbitrary pairs of observables .",
    "the robertson relation involving the expectations of the commutator in the lower bound fails to provide preparation uncertainty relation in the above sense because the only state - independent lower bound one can get from it is zero .",
    "nevertheless , non - trivial state - independent bounds usually do exist .",
    "uncertainty is really a ubiquitous phenomenon , joint measurability or simultaneous sharp preparability are the exceptions rather than the rule .    with all these generalizations one ends up with a zoo of relations and , perhaps , with the possibility of writing many boring papers .",
    "our excuse for adding to this zoo is twofold : on one hand there is only a relatively small set of standard observables and pairs for which uncertainty questions are relevant  and number and angle , to be studied here , are one such pair . on the other hand ,",
    "we believe that the general methods for obtaining sharp relations are of some interest . in this way ,",
    "when one rare animal from the zoo comes in handy , the pertinent sharp uncertainty relation can be generated easily , following standard procedures .",
    "this is why we organized our paper according to the methods employed .",
    "it is a special property of the case at hand ",
    "number and angle  that an essentially complete treatment can be given .",
    "this is due to the phase space symmetry which implies , exactly as for standard position and momentum @xcite , that `` metric distance '' and `` calibration distance '' for the error assessment of observables satisfy the same relations and also that they are quantitatively the same as corresponding preparation uncertainty relations . in this paper",
    "we deduce the ensuing measurement uncertainty relations for number and angle .",
    "the complementarity between number and angle appears in physics in various guises . essentially , this is for any parameter with a natural periodicity .",
    "geometric angles are one case , with the complementary variable given by a component of angular momentum .",
    "another important case is quantum optical phase , which is complementary to an harmonic oscillator hamiltonian . at least for preparation uncertainty",
    "this is no difficulty , since a relation valid for all states also holds for states supported on the subspace of positive number .",
    "one does get additional or sharper relations from building in this constraint , however .",
    "a further important field of applications is quasi - momentum with values in the brillouin - zone for a lattice system ( of which we only consider the one - dimensional case here ) .",
    "this is also related to form factors arising in the discussion of diffraction patterns and fringe contrast from periodic gratings @xcite .",
    "the literature on angle - angular momentum uncertainty is almost exclusively concerned with the preparation scenario , although the lack of an error disturbance relation has been noted @xcite . in the preparation case",
    "a major obstacle was the kennard and robertson @xcite relation and their role as a model how uncertainty relations should be set up .",
    "there is nothing wrong with an observable with outcomes on a circle . but",
    "much work was wasted on the question of how to turn `` angle '' into a selfadjoint operator @xcite .",
    "additional unnecessary confusion in the case of semibounded number and quantum optical phase was generated by the ignorance or lack of acceptance of generalized ( `` povm '' ) observables . on the positive side ,",
    "an influential paper by judge @xcite produced a relation ( for the arc metric ) , and conjectured an improvement , which was proved shortly afterwards @xcite . in this context the role of ground state problems for finding optimal bounds , which is also the basis of our methods , seems to have appeared for the first time @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the chordal metric grew out of the approach of avoiding the `` angle '' problem , replacing @xmath0 by the two selfadjoint operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "both in preparation and in measurement uncertainty we have to assess the difference of probability distributions : for preparation uncertainty it is the difference from a sharp distribution concentrated on a single point .",
    "this is also the basis of calibration error assessment . for metric error",
    "we also need to express the distance of two general distributions .",
    "we want to express the distance between distributions on the same scale as the distance of points .",
    "for example , in the case of position and momentum errors , for all error measures one considers @xmath3 to be measured in length units and @xmath4 in momentum units .",
    "so let us assume that the outcomes of some observable lie in a space @xmath5 with metric @xmath6 .",
    "for real valued quantities like a single component of position or momentum this usually means @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we now extend the distance function on the points to a distance between a probability measure @xmath9 on @xmath5 and a point @xmath10 .",
    "it will just the be the mean distance from @xmath11 : @xmath12 here the exponent @xmath13 gives some extra flexibility as to how large deviations are weighted relative to small ones .",
    "the @xmath14 root ensures that the result is still in the same units as @xmath6 , and also that for a point measure @xmath9 concentrated on a point @xmath15 we have @xmath16 for all @xmath13 .",
    "it is also true for all @xmath13 that @xmath17 happens only for the point measure at @xmath11 .",
    "we will later mostly choose @xmath18 , which makes @xmath19 the root mean square distance from @xmath11 for points distributed according to @xmath9 , and drop the index @xmath13 .",
    "with this measure of deviation of a distribution @xmath9 from the point we can introduce the generalized standard deviation @xmath20 note that for @xmath18 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 this recovers exactly the usual standard deviation , with the minimum being attained at the mean of @xmath9 .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 is just a reminder of the minimization , and emphasizes that @xmath22 is just the distance of @xmath9 from the set of point measures .    for this interpretation to make sense",
    "we must also let the second argument of @xmath23 be a general probability distribution @xmath24 , resulting in a metric on the set of probability measures .",
    "the canonical definition here is the transport distance @xcite @xmath25 where `` @xmath26 '' is a shorthand for @xmath27 , the variable in this infimum , being a `` coupling '' of @xmath9 and @xmath24 , i.e. , it is a measure on @xmath28 with @xmath9 and @xmath24 as its marginal distributions .",
    "one should think of @xmath27 as a plan for converting the distribution @xmath9 into @xmath24 , maybe for some substance rather than for probability .",
    "the cost of transferring a mass unit from @xmath11 to @xmath15 is supposed to be @xmath29 , and the plan @xmath27 records just how much mass is to be moved from @xmath11 to @xmath15 .",
    "the marginal property means that the initial distribution is @xmath9 and the final one @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath30 is the optimized cost .",
    "when the final distribution is a point measure , there is not much to plan , and we recover .",
    "therefore there is little danger of confusion in using the same symbol for the metrics of points and of probability measures .",
    "now we can use these notions of spread and distance for expressing uncertainties related to observables @xmath31 with outcome spaces @xmath5 and @xmath32 , each with a suitably chosen metric and error exponents . let us denote by @xmath33 the probability measure of outcomes in @xmath5 upon measuring @xmath34 on systems prepared according to @xmath35 . to express _ preparation uncertainty _",
    ", let us consider the set @xmath36 of variance pairs @xmath37 a preparation uncertainty relation is some inequality saying that the uncertainty set does not extend to the origin : the two deviations can not both be simultaneously small .",
    "if this set is known , we consider it as the most comprehensive expression of preparation uncertainty .",
    "its description by inequalities for products or weighted sums or whatever is a matter of mathematical convenience , and we will , of course , develop appropriate expressions . a lower bound for the product is useful _ only _ for position and momentum and its mathematical equivalents . in this case",
    "the dilatation invariance @xmath38 forces the uncertainty region to be bounded by an exact hyperbola .",
    "but if one of the observables considered can take discrete values , the set will reach an axis , making every state - independent lower bound on the product trivial .",
    "we should note that the set is in general not convex , and can have holes ( for examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to express lower bounds , the essence of uncertainty , it makes no difference if we fill in these holes , and include with every point also those for which both coordinates are larger or the same .",
    "the resulting set , the ` monotone hull ' of @xmath39 is bounded below by a non - increasing function , the _ tradeoff curve _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : basic4 ] for examples ) . it still need not be convex in general , but we will see that convexity holds in the examples we study .    for _ measurement uncertainty _ we again consider two observables @xmath31 with the same outcomes , metrics and error exponents .",
    "now the question is : can @xmath31 be measured jointly ?",
    "the claim is , usually , that no matter how we try there will be an error in our implementation .",
    "so let @xmath40 be the margins of some joint measurement with outcomes @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 must exhibit some errors relative to @xmath34 , i.e. , some output distributions @xmath43 must be different from @xmath44 .",
    "we define as the error of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath34 the quantity @xmath45 note that we are using here a worst case quantity with respect to the input state .",
    "this is what we should do for a figure of merit for a measuring instrument .",
    "if a manufacturer claims that his device @xmath42 will produce distributions @xmath46-close to those of @xmath34 for any input state , he is saying that @xmath47 .",
    "making such a claim for just a single state is as useless as advertising a clock which measures `` the time @xmath48 '' very precisely ( but maybe no other ) .",
    "now we can look at the uncertainty set @xmath49 where the notation @xmath50 indicates that @xmath42 and @xmath51 are jointly measurable .",
    "all general remarks made about the preparation uncertainty set @xmath36 also hold for @xmath52 .",
    "the supremum in is rather demanding experimentally .",
    "good practice for testing the quality of a measuring device is _ calibration _",
    ", i.e. , testing it on states with known properties , and seeing whether the device reproduces these properties . in our case this means testing the device @xmath42 on states @xmath35 , whose @xmath34-distribution is sharply concentrated around some @xmath11 , and looking at the spread of the @xmath42-distribution around the same @xmath11 .",
    "we define as the calibration error of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath34 the quantity @xmath53 here the limit exists , because the set ( and hence the sup ) is decreasing as @xmath54 .",
    "this definition only makes sense if there actually are sufficiently many sharp states for @xmath34 , so we will use this definition only when the reference observable @xmath34 is projection valued . since the calibration states in this definition are also contained in the supremum , it is clear that @xmath55 , so the set @xmath56 of calibration error pairs will generally be larger than @xmath52 .",
    "we now consider systems with hilbert space @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the unit circle , with @xmath59 the integration over angle .",
    "the notation derives from `` torus '' and is customary in group theory .",
    "we use it here to emphasize the group structure ( of multiplying phases or adding angles mod@xmath60 ) but also to avoid a fixed coordinatization such as @xmath61 , which would misleadingly assign a special role to the cut point @xmath62 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath58 as our `` position space '' .",
    "the corresponding `` momentum '' space is @xmath63 , and changing to the momentum representation in @xmath64 is done by the unitary operator of expanding in a fourier series . with @xmath65 denoting the fourier basis , this means that @xmath66 we have two natural projection valued observables , the angle ( = position , phase ) observable @xmath67 taking values on @xmath58 , and the number ( = angular momentum observable ) @xmath68 with values in @xmath63 .",
    "that is , if @xmath69 is some function of the angle variable , @xmath70 denotes the multiplication operator @xmath71 , and similarly @xmath72 denotes the multiplication by a function @xmath73 in the momentum representation .",
    "the outcome proability densities of these observables on an input state @xmath35 are denoted by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "that is @xmath76 then the basic claim of preparation uncertainty is that @xmath74 and @xmath75 can not be simultaneously sharp , and the basic claim of measurement uncertainty is that there is is no observable with pairs of outcomes @xmath77 for which the marginal distributions found on input state @xmath35 are close to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    in order to apply the ideas of the previous section , we need to choose a metric in each of these spaces . for discrete values ( @xmath78 ) we can naturally take the standard distance or a discrete metric : @xmath79 similarly , there are two natural choices for angles , depending on whether the basis for the comparison is how far we have to rotate to go from @xmath0 to @xmath80 ( `` arc distance '' ) or else the distance of phase factors @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the plane ( `` chordal distance '' ) : @xmath83 the variances based on these bounded metrics will have an upper bound . since the minimum in makes @xmath84 a concave function of @xmath9 ,",
    "so that we find , by averaging over translates , that the equidistribution has the maximal variance for all translation invariant metrics and all exponents .",
    "both metrics , or rather their quadratic ( @xmath18 ) variances have been discussed before .",
    "the @xmath85-variance was used by lvy @xcite and judge @xcite , the @xmath86-variance seems to have appeared first in von mises @xcite .",
    "in fact , the quadratic chordal variance can also be written as @xmath87 which is von mises `` circular variance '' . for a review of these choices",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the only property needed in our approach is that the metric should not break the rotation invariance , i.e. , it should be a function of the difference of angles .",
    "we will therefore use every metric also as a single variable function , i.e. , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "functions which do not come from a metric have been considered in @xcite .",
    "then we have the following result .",
    "[ mainthm ] for all error exponents and choices of translation invariant metric the three uncertainty regions @xmath90 coincide .",
    "they are depicted for @xmath91 in figure  [ fig : basic4 ] . every point on one of the tradeoff",
    "curves belongs to a unique pure state ( resp . a unique extremal phase space covariant joint measurement ) .",
    "the proof of this proposition is based entirely on the corresponding proof for standard position and momentum @xcite .",
    "we will sketch the main steps in the next section , and also show how the computation of the tradeoff curve can be reduced to solving ground state problems for certain hamiltonians .",
    "the detailed features of these diagrams are then developed in the subsequent sections , sorted by the methods employed .",
    "the curves in figure  1 are determined numerically ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "since the algorithms employed provide optimal bounds , the figures are correct within pixel accuracy ( which can be easily pushed to high accuracy ) .",
    "in fact , the problem is very stable , in the sense that near minimal uncertainty implies that the state ( or joint observable ) is close to the minimizing one .",
    "the bounds for this are in terms of the spectral gap of the hamiltonian and are also discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerics ]    however , the only case in which the exact tradeoff curves can be described in closed form is ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : discrete ] ) @xmath92 even though , in all cases , the optimizing states can be expressed explicitly in terms of standard special functions ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : exact ] ) .",
    "therefore simple and explicit lower bounds are of interest .",
    "a problem here is that computing the variances for some particular state always produces a point inside the shaded area , i.e. , an upper bound to the lower bound represented by the tradeoff curve .",
    "this is useless for applications , so in sect .",
    "[ sec : lower ] we develop a procedure proving lower bounds , and thus correct ( if suboptimal ) uncertainty relations .",
    "in this section we briefly sketch the arguments leading to the equality of preparation und measurement uncertainty .",
    "the full proof is directly parallel to the one given in @xcite for position and momentum .",
    "the basic reference for phase space quantum mechanics is @xcite .",
    "the theory there is developed for phase spaces of the form @xmath93 , but all results we need here immediately carry over to the general case @xmath94 , where @xmath5 is a locally compact abelian group and @xmath95 is its dual , in our case @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "a systematic extension of @xcite to the general case , including the finer points , is in preparation in collaboration with jussi schultz .",
    "the phase space in our setting is the group @xmath98 .",
    "we join the position translations and the momentum translations to phase space translations , which are represented by the displacement or _",
    "weyl operators _ @xmath99 these operators commute up to a phase , so that the operators @xmath100 , i.e. , the action of the weyl operators on bounded operators @xmath101 , is a representation of the abelian group @xmath102 .",
    "a crucial property is the square integrability of the matrix elements of the weyl operators , which we will use in the form that for any two trace class operators @xmath103 on @xmath104 the formula @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "hence , when both @xmath35 and @xmath107 are density operators the integrand in this equation is a probability density on @xmath102 .",
    "this means that every density operator @xmath107 also serves an observable @xmath108 with outcomes @xmath109 , via @xmath110 thus @xmath107 is the operator valued radon - nikodym density with respect to @xmath111 of @xmath108 at the origin , and by translation also at arbitrary points .",
    "the observables obtained in this way are precisely the _ covariant _ ones , i.e. , those satisfying the equation @xmath112 @xcite .    for the discussion of uncertainties",
    "we need the margins of such observables .",
    "one can guess their form from a fruitful classical analogy @xcite , by which the integrand in can be read as a convolution of @xmath35 and @xmath107 . for classical probability densities on a cartesian product",
    "it is easily checked that the margin of the convolution is the convolution of the margins .",
    "the same is true for operators , only that the margins of a density operator are the classical distributions @xmath74 and @xmath75 described above . if @xmath113 is a probability density on phase space we will also denote by @xmath114 and @xmath115 the respective margins on @xmath58 and @xmath63 . in particular , for the output distribution of the covariant observable @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath116 , one checks readily checks the marginal relations @xmath117 where `` @xmath118 '' means the convolution of probability densities on @xmath63 and @xmath58 . since this is the operation associated with the sum of independent random variables we arrive at the following principle :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ both margins of a covariant phase space measurement @xmath108 can be simulated by first making the corresponding ideal measurement on the input state , and then adding some independent noise , which is also independent of the input state .",
    "the distribution of this noise is the corresponding margin of the the density operator @xmath107_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this principle is responsible for the remarkable equality of the preparation uncertainty set @xmath39 and the measurement uncertainty sets @xmath119 and @xmath120 . indeed",
    "the added noise is what distinguishes the margins of an attempted joint measurement from an ideal measurement , and this has precisely the distribution relevant for preparation uncertainty for @xmath107 .      while this principle explains quite well what happens in the case of covariant observables @xmath108 , proposition  [ mainthm ] makes no covariance assumption .",
    "the key for reducing the general case is the observation that our quality criteria in terms of @xmath122 do not single out a point in phase space .",
    "therefore the set @xmath123 of observables whose angle margin @xmath124 is @xmath125-close to the ideal observable , @xmath126 , and whose number margin satisfies @xmath127 is closed under phase space shifts , i.e. , is unchanged when we replace @xmath128 by @xmath129 with @xmath130 note that the fixed points of all these transformations are precisely the covariant observables .",
    "the second point to note is that the set @xmath123 is convex , because the worst case error of an average in a convex combination is smaller than the average of the worst case errors .",
    "it is also a compact set in a suitable weak topology .",
    "this is in contrast to the set of all observables : since there are arbitrarily large shifts in @xmath63 , we can shift an observable to infinity such that the probabilities for all fixed finite regions go to zero .",
    "the weak limit of such observables would be zero or , in an alternative formulation , would acquire some weight on points at infinity ( a compactification of @xmath63 ) .",
    "for such a sequence , however , the errors would also diverge .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this suffices to ensure the compactness of @xmath123 .",
    "then the markov - kakutani fixed point theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.10.6 ) ensures that @xmath123 contains a common fixed point of all the transformations .    in summary , for every joint observable @xmath128",
    "there is a covariant one for which the errors are at least as good .",
    "therefore for determining @xmath119 we can just assume the observable in question to be covariant , implying the very simple form of the margins described above .",
    "the argument for @xmath120 is the same .",
    "we have noted that , in general , @xmath132 , because for calibration the worst case analysis is done over a much smaller set of states .",
    "indeed , it is easy to construct examples of observable pairs where the inequality is strict .",
    "there is a general result ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  8) , however , which implies equality .",
    "the condition is that @xmath42 arises from @xmath34 by classical , possibly stochastic post - processing .",
    "in other words we can simulate @xmath42 by first measuring @xmath34 , and then adding noise or , in other words , generating a random output by a process which may depend on the measured @xmath34-value .",
    "the noise is described then by a transition probability kernel @xmath133 for turning the measured value @xmath11 into somewhere in the set @xmath134 .",
    "@xmath135 is thus a description of the noise , and its relevant size is given by the formula @xmath136 here the @xmath34-essential supremum of a measurable function is the supremum of all @xmath137 such that the level set @xmath138 has non - zero measure with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "this is needed to ensure that @xmath133 enters this formula only for values @xmath11 that can actually occur as outputs of @xmath34 .      however , in the case at hand no such subtlety will occur , because the noise is independent of @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath135 is translation invariant and so is the metric .",
    "therefore , the integral in is simply independent of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we know the distribution of the noise on each margin to be the respective margin of @xmath107 , so that the integral is just the @xmath13-power deviation of the margin from zero .",
    "so we get , for any choice of exponents and translation invariant metrics on @xmath58 and @xmath63 : @xmath140 and similarly for @xmath68 .",
    "note that the last term here is _ not _ the variance @xmath141 , because the minimization over @xmath11 in is missing .",
    "indeed , if @xmath142 just had zero variance , i.e , be a point measure at some point @xmath143 we would get a constant shift of size @xmath144 between the distributions @xmath145 and @xmath74 , and this would be the errors on the left hand side .",
    "so for a fixed @xmath107 we can only say that the terms in are @xmath146 . on the other hand , we are looking for _ optimal _ @xmath107 and these will be obtained by shifting @xmath107 in such a way that is minimized . hence , as far as uncertainty diagrams are concerned , we can replace the last term by the @xmath13-deviation .",
    "this concludes the proof that the three uncertainty diagrams coincide .",
    "we now describe the general method to find the tradeoff curve .",
    "the idea is to fix some negative slope @xmath147 in the diagram , and ask for the lowest straight line with that slope intersecting @xmath39 .",
    "that is , we look at the optimal lower bound @xmath148 such that @xmath149 now both coordinates @xmath150 and @xmath151 are linear functions of @xmath107 , so that the left hand side of is just the @xmath107-expectation of some operator , namely @xmath152 here @xmath153 and @xmath154 are the metrics chosen for these spaces , and we used the notation of writing @xmath70 for the multiplication operator by @xmath155 , and its fourier transformed counterpart , and also the convention that @xmath88 for a translation invariant metric .",
    "the optimal constant @xmath156 is thus the lowest expectation @xmath157 , i.e. , its _ ground state energy_. note that for standard position and momentum phase space and @xmath91 we get here @xmath158 , a harmonic oscillator , and the well - known connection between its ground state and minimum uncertainty .",
    "we will look into these ground state problems later and for now note some general features .",
    "* the variable @xmath159 is positive because we are looking for lower bounds on @xmath11 and @xmath15 only .",
    "this corresponds in part to taking the monotone closure , and is the reason why we replace @xmath39 by @xmath36 in . *",
    "the best bound on @xmath36 obtained in this way is achieved by optimizing over @xmath159 , i.e. , @xmath160 the legendre transform of @xmath161 .",
    "this is automatically convex . in other words ,",
    "the method does not describe @xmath39 in general , but its convex hull ( the intersection of all half spaces with positive normal containing @xmath36 ) .",
    "* there may be points on the tradeoff curve for the convex hull , which do not really correspond to a realizable pair of uncertainties .",
    "however , if we take the collection of ( @xmath159-dependent ) ground states , and their variance pairs trace out a continuous curve , we know that the tradeoff curves are the same and the set @xmath39 is actually convex and fully characterized by the ground state method .    when the ground state problem for @xmath162 has a gap , it is known that any state with expectations close to the ground state energy must actually be close to the ground state .",
    "more precisely , suppose that @xmath163 has a unique ground state vector , @xmath164 , and that the next largest eigenvalue is @xmath165 .",
    "then @xmath166 .",

    ". we can directly apply this principle to the above ground state problems .",
    "the basic geometry is described in fig .",
    "[ fig : nearmin ] .",
    "this shows that the curve of minimizers is continuous .",
    "it will also be useful in showing explicitly that the minimizers for different choices of metrics are sometimes quite close to each other , or that some simple ansatz for the minimizer is quantitatively good .",
    "here we only consider the case @xmath171 because for the discrete metric on @xmath63 the ground state problem has an elementary explicit solution ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : discrete ] ) .",

    "the matrix elements of the relevant hamiltonians for basis vectors in this range can be written down as simple explicit expressions . from these the numerical version of the hamiltonian",
    "is determined as floating point matrix of the desired precision , for which the ground state and first excited state are determined by standard algorithms .",
    "all these steps were carried out in mathematica .",
    "the criterion for the choice of @xmath173 was that the highest-@xmath174 components of the eigenvectors found should be negligible at the target accuracy .",
    "the target accuracy was mostly @xmath175 digits with computations done in machine precision with @xmath176 , but was chosen larger for getting a reliable estimate of the separation of the different state families .",
    "all computations must be considered elementary and highly efficient , even at high accuracy .",
    "none of the diagrams in this paper takes computation time longer than a keystroke .",
    "it is therefore hardly of numerical advantage to implement the analytic solutions of sect .",
    "[ sec : exact ] , not in computation time and even less in programming and verification time .",
    "perhaps the only surprise in this problem is that for the two different metrics @xmath85 and @xmath86 the minimizing state families are so close . since @xmath177 , the ground state problems for @xmath178 and @xmath179 are related .",
    "perturbatively one sees that the ground state energies are indeed similar , up to the expectation of @xmath180 .",
    "the stability statement at the end of sect .",
    "[ sec : minvariance ] then implies that the corresponding ground states are also similar .",
    "however , direct comparison gives a norm bound , which is rather better than these arguments indicate : @xmath181 for all @xmath159 , corresponding to a fidelity @xmath182 .",
    "this still does not quite reflect the similarity of these two state families : when we allow the @xmath159-arguments to differ , we get a much better approximation . to make this precise consider the orbits @xmath183 , and an analogously defined @xmath184 . for sets in hilbert space we use the hausdorff metric ,",
    "so that @xmath185 means that for every point in one set there is an @xmath186-close one in the other .",
    "then one easily gets @xmath187    consequently , there is really only one diagram representing the family of minimal uncertainty states , which we show in fig .",

    "the condition can be expressed by using the standard differentiation formulas for the hypergeometric functions : @xmath202 however , as far as we could see , the theory of hypergeometric functions seems to offer little help for solving it , or for evaluating the normalization constant @xmath68 or the fourier coefficients .",
    "perhaps an elementary expression for @xmath156 is too much to hope for , since already in much simpler problems , e.g. , a particle in a box , where the pertinent transcendental equations involve only trigonometric and linear functions , no `` explicit '' solution can be given either .",

    "this allows us to solve for @xmath195 : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the normalization constant .",
    "inserting this into gives the consistency condition @xmath224 the smallest positive solution @xmath225 of this equation will give us the desired bound .",
    "however , we can also proceed more directly by using just the functional form , which we can further simplify to the one - parameter family @xmath226 , with a single parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we then have to solve three integrals : @xmath227 then the pair of variances @xmath228 lies on the tradeoff curve .",
    "one can check that this is consistent with the legendre transform picture , i.e. , condition in the form @xmath229 and its derivative and the parameter identification @xmath230 .",
    "now for the arc metric we have @xmath231 and @xmath232 trying to eliminate @xmath9 from leads to a transcendental equation , so one can not give a closed inequality involving just the variances .    for the chord metric we have @xmath233 and @xmath234 in this case one",
    "can easily eliminate @xmath9 from , and the tradeoff is explicitly described by equation .",
    "in this section we establish a variational method for proving uncertainty relations by applying such bounds for the ground state problem . of course , variational methods for the ground state problem are well - known",
    ". basically they amount to choosing some good trial state , and evaluating the energy expectation : this will be an upper bound on the ground state energy , and it will be a good one if we have guessed well .",
    "however , it is notoriously difficult to find lower bounds on the ground state energy .",
    "the idea for finding such bounds is via the following lemma :    [ boundlemma]let @xmath220 be a @xmath60-periodic real valued potential , and @xmath163 the schrdinger operator @xmath235 with ground state energy @xmath236 .",
    "consider a twice differentiable periodic function @xmath168 , which is everywhere @xmath237 .",
    "then the ground state energy of @xmath163 is larger or equal to @xmath238    let @xmath239 and @xmath240 the schrdinger operator with this potential .",
    "then @xmath168 is an eigenfunction of @xmath240 with eigenvalue @xmath241 , and since it was assumed to be positive , it has no nodes and must hence be the ground state eigenfunction . on the other hand , because @xmath242 , we have @xmath243 and hence @xmath244 . by the rayleigh - ritz variational principle @xcite this implies the ordering of the ground state energies , i.e. , @xmath245 .    finding a @xmath168 which gives a good bound is usually more demanding than finding a good @xmath246-approximant for the ground state , because of the highly discontinuous expression @xmath247 and the infimum being taken over the whole interval . in particular , the approximate eigenvectors obtained by other methods may perform poorly , even give negative lower bounds on a manifestly positive operator .",
    "the positivity of @xmath168 may be ensured by setting @xmath248 ; then one has to minimize @xmath249 .",
    "we now consider the above four combinations of metrics case by case , also comparing the results with existing uncertainty relations found in the literature .",
    "this demonstrates how our systematic approach relates to many existing ( seemingly ad hoc ) uncertainty relations .",
    "one remark should be made concerning the comparison with the literature : the uncertainty measure used for the number operator is practically always taken to be the usual standard deviation , which can be different from @xmath250 since in the latter case the infimum is taken only over the set of integers . in general",
    "we have @xmath251 where the right - hand side is the usual standard deviation , which takes a distribution on the integers as a distribution on the reals , which is supported by the integers . due to the above inequality",
    "any uncertainty tradeoff involving the usual standard deviation also implies the same relation for @xmath250 .",
    "the literature on this case begins with the observation that the standard uncertainty relation does not hold and needs to be modified ; judge @xcite showed in 1963 that the following tradeoff relation @xmath253 holds with @xmath254 , and conjectured the same with @xmath255 .",
    "the conjecture was quickly proved in @xcite using the lagrange multiplier method where @xmath256 is minimised under the constraint of fixed @xmath257 , and in @xcite by showing that the admissible pairs @xmath258 lie above the tangent lines of the curve determined by the equality in .",
    "both methods are essentially equivalent to our approach , and explicitly involve the same eigenvalue problem . in @xcite",
    "the bound leading to with the optimal constant was obtained using special properties of the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "we first show how the above lemma can easily be applied to derive with the optimal constant @xmath255 .",
    "an essentially identical procedure works also in other cases below .",
    "the potential is @xmath231 , and we have label the uncertainty pairs as @xmath259 . as the simplest ansatz we take @xmath260 even , hence a polynomial in @xmath261 , which take as quadratic .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath262 then leaves the one - parameter family @xmath263 where @xmath264 is to be optimised later .",
    "the bound given by the lemma on the uncertainty pair @xmath265 is then @xmath266 this inequality is valid for any @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "we choose @xmath159 so that the linear term in @xmath269 vanishes , i.e. , @xmath270 .",
    "the remaining polynomial is then positive because of @xmath271 , and hence takes its minimum at @xmath272 .",
    "therefore , @xmath273 the optimal value here is @xmath274 .",
    "note that this is alwas positive , because the equidistribution has the largest variance , namely @xmath275 .",
    "substituting the optimal @xmath276 in we get exactly .",
    "we first recall from that @xmath278 .",
    "hence , the von mises  circular variance \" is associated with the sine and cosine operators @xmath279 and @xmath280 , introduced by carruthers , nieto , louisell , susskind , glogower , and others to study the  quantum phase problem \" @xcite .",

    "* eq . ( 4.11 ) ) the tradeoff relation @xmath283^{1/2 } } , \\ ] ] expressed here in quantities relevant for our discussion .",
    "it was shown by jackiw @xcite that there are no states for which this inequality is saturated , i.e. , this bound is not sharp .",
    "it is interesting to note that by replacing the square root term with its trivial upper bound @xmath284 , we get @xmath285 which is just the version of judge s bound for this metric .",
    "other lower bounds were studied relatively recently @xcite by using approximations of the mathieu functions associated with the exact tradeoff curve .",
    "we first show how can be obtained using lemma [ boundlemma ] by applying the same procedure as above .",
    "interestingly , the relevant trial states are exactly the ones saturating the robertson inequality for the first commutator in , that is , we take @xmath286 . then the resulting variational expression is a function of the variable @xmath1 , and hence of the potential @xmath220 : @xmath287 again it is a good choice to take @xmath159 so that the first order term in @xmath220 vanishes , so that the remaining infimum is attained at @xmath288 .",
    "this gives @xmath289 and @xmath290 where at the last equality we have substituted the optimal value @xmath291 .",
    "on taking the square root this is .    in order to obtain analytic bounds better than the carruthers - nieto tradeoff",
    ", we apply our method with a trial function which is second order in @xmath1 : we take @xmath292 .",
    "the expression to be minimized over @xmath0 can still be written as a polynomial in the potential , and numerical inspection suggests once again that it is a good idea to choose the parameters @xmath159 and @xmath293 so that coefficients of @xmath220 and @xmath294 vanish .",
    "this gives linear equations for @xmath159 and @xmath293 , and the resulting polynomial has its unique minimum , namely @xmath276 , at @xmath288 .",
    "the analogue of is then @xmath295 optimizing @xmath276 now leads to a third order algebraic equation for which the cardano solution gives a useless expression in terms of roots .",
    "if one just wants the tradeoff curve , the solution is actually not necessary . defining the coefficient of @xmath11 as a function @xmath296 ,",
    "so that @xmath297 .",
    "optimality requires @xmath298 , so we get the tradeoff curve in parametrized form @xmath299 .",
    "the methods employed in this paper for obtaining preparation uncertainty bounds can be applied to a large variety of similar problems . however , the derivation of measurement uncertainty bounds relied entirely on the theorem that phase space symmetry makes the two coincide .",
    "independent efficient methods for obtaining sharp bounds for measurement uncertainty so far have not been found , and it would be highly desirable to find such methods . a possible substitute might be a proof of the conjecture that measurement uncertainty is always larger than preparation uncertainty . although this inequality must be strict in general , in that way the easily computed preparation uncertainty bounds would automatically be valid ( but usually suboptimal ) measurement uncertainty bounds",
    ". however , the only evidence for supporting such a conjecture is the comparison of cases where either kind of uncertainty vanishes , so such a result is perhaps too much to hope for .",
