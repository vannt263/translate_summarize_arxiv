    "the distribution of entanglement is a central topic of investigation in the quantum information community .",
    "unfortunately , this distribution is also fragile : quantum systems inevitably interact with the external environment whose decoherent action typically degrades their entanglement .",
    "the worst scenario is when decoherence is so strong as to destroy any input entanglement .",
    "mathematically , this situation is represented by the concept of entanglement - breaking channel  @xcite . in general , a quantum channel @xmath0  is entanglement - breaking when its local action on one part of a bipartite state always results into a separable output state . in other words , given two systems , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , in an arbitrary bipartite state @xmath3 , the output state @xmath4  is always separable , where @xmath5 is the identity channel applied to system @xmath1 and @xmath6 is the entanglement - breaking channel applied to system @xmath2 .    despite entanglement - breaking channels having been the subject of an intensive study by the community",
    ", they have only been analyzed under markovian conditions of no memory .",
    "in other words , when the distribution involves two or more systems , these systems are typically assumed to be perturbed in an independent fashion , each of them subject to the same memoryless channel .",
    "for instance , consider the scheme depicted in panel ( 1 ) of fig .",
    "[ scenario ] , where a middle station ( charlie ) has a bipartite system @xmath7 in some entangled state , but its communication lines with two remote parties ( alice and bob ) are affected by entanglement - breaking channels @xmath8 and @xmath6 .    under the assumption of memoryless channels ,",
    "there is clearly no way to distribute entanglement among any of the parties .",
    "suppose that charlie tries to share entanglement with one of the remote parties by sending one of the two systems while keeping the other ( a scenario that we call 1-system transmission  or just single transmission ) . for instance , charlie may keep system @xmath1 while transmitting system @xmath2 to bob .",
    "the action of @xmath9 destroys the initial entanglement , so that systems @xmath1 ( kept ) and @xmath10 ( transmitted ) are separable .",
    "symmetrically , the action of @xmath11 destroys the entanglement between system @xmath12 ( transmitted ) and system @xmath2 ( kept ) .",
    "now suppose that charlie sends system @xmath1 to alice and system @xmath2 to bob ( a scenario that we call 2-system transmission  or double transmission ) .",
    "since the joint action of the two  channels is given by the tensor product @xmath13 quantum entanglement must necessarily be destroyed . in other words , since we have 1-system entanglement - breaking , then we must have 2-system entanglement - breaking .     and @xmath2 .",
    "alice and bob are the remote receiving stations .",
    "charlie may choose to keep one system and send the other to alice or bob ( single transmission ) or he may decide to send both the systems to the remote stations ( double transmission ) . in panel  ( 1 )",
    "we consider two memoryless entanglement - breaking channels , @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "no entanglement can be distributed , neither via single transmission ( charlie @xmath14 alice or charlie @xmath14bob ) , nor via double transmission ( charlie @xmath14 alice and bob ) . in panel",
    "( 2 ) we consider the presence of correlations between the two entanglement - breaking channels . in this scenario , despite entanglement can not be distributed by single transmission ( charlie can not be entangled with alice or bob ) , still it can be distributed via the double transmission ( so that alice and bob can become entangled ) .",
    "this reactivation of entanglement distribution is possible in the presence of classical correlations , i.e. , for an environment ( systems @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) in a purely - classical state ( separable , with zero - discord).,scaledwidth=62.0% ]    in this paper we show that the previous implication is false when we introduce correlations ( i.e. , a memory ) between the two entanglement - breaking channels . in other words , in the presence of correlated - noise environments , the double transmission can successfully distribute entanglement despite the single transmission being subject to entanglement - breaking .",
    "this is equivalent to say that charlie can transmit entanglement to alice and bob , despite not being able to share any entanglement with them .",
    "the most interesting fact is that the entanglement distribution via the double transmission is reactivated by the presence of separable and purely - classical correlations in the joint environment .",
    "this effect is proven for quantum systems with hilbert spaces of any dimension , both finite ( qudits ) and infinite ( continuous variable systems  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , here we are interested in showing the simplest examples of correlated - noise environments which allow for a _ perfect distribution _ of entanglement via the double transmission ( 2-system entanglement - preserving ) while preventing any entanglement distribution via the single transmission ( 1-system entanglement - breaking ) .",
    "these environments are constructed by using the so - called twirling operators @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) .",
    "a random unitary @xmath19 is applied to system @xmath1 and the same unitary ( or its conjugate ) is applied to system @xmath2 . while the local action of a random unitary ( @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) is entanglement - breaking , the correlated action ( @xmath17 ) perfectly preserves specific classes of entangled states ( belonging to decoherent - free subspaces of the joint correlated environment ) .",
    "since these twirling environments  are based on local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , they are expected to introduce correlations which are separable ( local ) and , more precisely , purely - classical .",
    "this feature can be checked by considering a unitary dilation where an explicit system for the environment is introduced . for the twirling environments ,",
    "such a system can be described by a classical state , i.e. , separable with zero quantum discord .",
    "twirling environments can easily be constructed for quantum systems of any dimension . in the case of two qudits ( each with hilbert space of dimension @xmath22 ) ,",
    "the randomization of the twirling operators @xmath17 ( or @xmath23 ) is performed over the entire unitary group . in this case , it is easy to identify states which are invariant under @xmath17-twirling ( werner states  @xcite ) and @xmath18-twirling ( isotropic states  @xcite ) . in the specific case of qubits ( @xmath24 ) , we can restrict the randomization to the basis of the pauli operators , with the qubit werner state being invariant under pauli twirling .",
    "things are less trivial for infinite dimension , in particular , for bosonic modes . in this case , we restrict the twirling operators to the compact group of orthogonal symplectic transformations , i.e. , phase - space rotations .",
    "the bosonic twirling environment so defined is non - gaussian .",
    "it is interesting to see that , only for the @xmath18-twirling , we can identify gaussian states which are invariant and entangled : these are the two mode squeezed vacuum states , also known as einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states  @xcite .    in terms of potential impact ,",
    "our work opens new possibilities for entanglement distribution in correlated - noise environments and memory channels , where the presence of correlations can be exploited to recover from entanglement breaking .",

    "can he still distribute entanglement to alice and bob ?",
    "yes , this is possible because we can identify a class of entangled states which are invariant under the action of the correlated map  ( [ qubitenv ] ) .",

    "this is a non - gaussian channel , since the twirling operator @xmath113 , despite gaussian , is not averaged using a gaussian distribution but a uniform one .",
    "it is clearly based on random loccs , since random rotations are locally applied to each bosonic mode and they are correlated via classical communication .",
    "it is interesting that the unitary dilation of this channel can be restricted to a finite - dimensional environment .",
    "the reason is because the single - mode rotation operator @xmath114 belongs to the compact subgroup of the orthogonal symplectic transformations @xmath115 ( which are passive gaussian unitaries , i.e. , unitary transformations preserving both the gaussian statistics and the energy of the state ) .",
    "then , @xmath116 is isomorphic to the unitary group @xmath117 , which is the multiplicative group composed by all complex numbers with module 1 , also known as the circle group .",
    "for this reason , a unitary 2-design @xmath118 can be mapped into a unitary 2-design for @xmath116  @xcite . as a result , we can write @xmath119 for a suitable set of angles @xmath120  and where @xmath121 or @xmath122 . in this form ,",
    "the channel is manifestly non gaussian .",
