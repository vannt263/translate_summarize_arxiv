    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) plays a vital role in the ongoing cycle of stellar birth and death and galactic evolution .",
    "however , the role of interstellar matter , from how its properties are influenced by stars to how in turn its properties influence star formation , is poorly understood and is arguably the least understood portion of the cycle .",
    "warm diffuse ionized hydrogen has become recognized as a major phase of the ism of our galaxy ; see , for example , reviews by @xcite .",
    "this phase consists of regions of warm ( 10@xmath7 k ) , low - density ( 10@xmath8 @xmath9 ) , nearly fully ionized hydrogen that occupy approximately 20% of the volume within a 2 kpc thick layer about the galactic midplane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one kiloparsec above the midplane , warm  may be the dominant state of the interstellar medium in the milky way .",

    "despite its significance , the origin and physical conditions within the warm ionized medium ( wim ) remain poorly understood . in particular , the ubiquitous nature of this gas is difficult to explain . of the known sources of ionization within the galaxy ,",
    "only o stars generate enough power to sustain the wim @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is generally believed that the o stars , confined primarily to widely separated stellar associations near the galactic midplane , are somehow able to photoionize a significant fraction of the ism not only in the disk but also within the halo , 1 - 2 kpc above the midplane",
    ". however , the need to have a large fraction of the lyman continuum photons from o stars travel hundreds of parsecs through the disk seems to conflict with the traditional picture of  permeating much of the interstellar volume near the galactic plane .",
    "it has been suggested that extensive cavities in the neutral gas , created either by `` superbubbles '' of hot gas from supernovae @xcite , or carved out by o star photons in low - density regions @xcite , may extend far above the midplane @xcite .",
    "although the existence of  superbubbles has long been established @xcite , direct observational evidence that cavities are actually responsible for the transport of hot gas and ionizing radiation up into the galactic halo is very limited .",
    "one piece of evidence for such transport has been provided recently by the wham h@xmath0  sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see  6 below ) .",
    "the wham h@xmath0  sky survey is a velocity - resolved map of diffuse interstellar h@xmath0  emission at @xmath11 angular resolution over the entire northern sky ( @xmath12 ) within approximately @xmath13 kms@xmath8  of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) @xcite .",
    "the survey maps show h@xmath0  emission covering the sky , with ionized gas associated with large scale loops , filaments , and bubbles superposed on a fainter , diffuse background , as well as the bright classical  regions near the galactic plane .",
    "several of the high latitude structures appear to be associated with hot stars and ob associations ; however , the diffuse background and many features superposed upon it have no clear association with known ionizing sources .",
    "this survey provides the basis for studies of the physical conditions within these newly revealed emission regions and the source of their ionization .",
    "even though the primary source of ionization is believed to be o stars , the temperature and ionization conditions within the diffuse ionized gas differ significantly from conditions within classical o star   regions .",
    "these conditions have been inferred by using optical line ratios diagnostic techniques .",
    "for example , anomalously strong [ ] @xmath3/h@xmath0  and [ ] @xmath1/h@xmath0 , and weak [ ] @xmath4/h@xmath0  emission line ratios ( compared to the bright , classical  regions ) indicate a low state of excitation , with few ions present that require ionization energies greater than 23 ev @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the small value of  @xmath14/h@xmath0  near the midplane , indicating that the ionization fraction of helium is low and suggesting that the spectrum of the diffuse interstellar radiation field that ionizes the hydrogen is significantly softer than that from the average galactic o star population @xcite .",
    "in addition , the elevated [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios in the wim suggest that this low density diffuse gas is significantly warmer than traditional   regions and may require spectral processing of the stellar radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and/or an additional heating source beyond photoionization @xcite .",
    "recent observations of [ ] @xmath2/[]@xmath1 have indeed confirmed that the wim is about 2000 k warmer than  regions @xcite .",
    "below we present new wham observations of [ ] @xmath1 , [ ] @xmath3 , [ ] @xmath4 , @xmath5 and [ ] @xmath2  toward large - scale emission structures as well as individual lines of sight , representing a substantial increase in the number of observations of these diagnostic emission lines in the galaxy .",
    "this is primarily an empirical study .",
    "the emission regions examined span a wide range in location , environment , morphology , and scale , and we have compared the line intensity ratios in these different environments in order to explore the variations in physical conditions between them . a more detailed analysis and deeper understanding of all these different regions , the relationships between them , and the reasons for the observed differences will require combining these observations with photoionization models , and is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "observations of optical emission lines and their relative strengths is a common diagnostic tool used to assess the physical conditions of ionized gas .",
    "the wham sky survey has measured the h@xmath0  surface brightness , @xmath16 , which is directly proportional to the emission measure . in the absence of extinction , this relationship is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the temperature of the gas in units of 10@xmath19  k , and @xmath16   is measured in rayleighs @xcite .    in the wim , the collisionally excited lines of [ ] @xmath1 and [ ] @xmath3 are the next brightest optical lines that can be observed with wham . @xcite presented the first velocity resolved maps of these lines in the galaxy , toward a 40@xmath15@xmath2030@xmath15  region in perseus .",
    "radial velocity interval maps showed a strong trend in [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0 , in which these ratios were higher toward regions of low h@xmath0emission , while [ ] / [ ]  remained relatively constant .",

    "the similar first ionization potentials of n and h ( 14.5 and 13.6 ev , respectively ) , along with n - h charge - exchange , mean that in the wim the ionization fraction of n@xmath22/n is expected to be similar to h@xmath22/h .",
    "the fraction h@xmath22/h is observed to be near unity in the wim @xcite , and the high second ionization potential of n ( 29.6 ev ) means that little n is likely to be in the form of n@xmath23 .",
    "this is supported by the weak [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios in the wim ( see below ) and by photoionization modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have shown that n@xmath22/n @xmath24 over a wide range of input spectra and ionization parameters . as a result ,",
    "n@xmath22/h@xmath22  is likely to depend almost entirely on the gas phase abundance of n / h , which we have assumed to be the same for all the emission regions . using this argument ,",
    "@xcite attributed the higher [ ] /h@xmath0 ratios in the wim to higher temperatures of the gas , which has since been confirmed ( see  [ sec : niiblue ] ) .",
    "they found in the perseus spiral arm , for example , an increase in temperature from @xmath25 k close to the galactic plane up to @xmath26 k at @xmath27 1 kpc from the midplane .    the observed variations in [ ] /h@xmath0  can also be interpreted as a change in temperature",
    "however , the second ionization potential of s ( 23.4 ev ) is just below the neutral he edge at 24.6 ev .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of s can be s@xmath23 , and the ratio of [ ] /h@xmath0  is a combination of both temperature and ionization effects .",
    "the ratio of [ ] / [ ] , however , is insensitive to temperature because of the nearly identical energies required to excite the lines .",

    "the extremely faint  auroral \" line of [ ] @xmath2 , along with [ ] @xmath29 , are two such diagnostic lines that are within the observational capabilities of wham . the ratio of the emissivity of these lines is given simply by    @xmath21~\\lambda5755}{[\\rm{n~\\textsc{ii}}]~\\lambda6584 } = 0.192~e^{-2.5/t_4 } , \\label{eq : niiblueeq}\\ ] ]    @xcite .",

    "because the second ionization potential of oxygen is 35 ev , observations of [ ] @xmath4 can provide information about the higher ions .",

    "these observations implied that the spectrum of the diffuse radiation field in the wim , at least along those low latitude lines of sight , is significantly softer than that from the average galactic o star population .",

    "the observations were divided into contiguous ` blocks ' , with each block consisting of up to 49 observations that cover an approximately @xmath40 area of the sky . each direction within a block",

    "in addition , spectra of [ ] @xmath1 , [ ] @xmath2 , [ ] , , [ ] , and were obtained toward a number of individual sightlines in pointed mode to probe selected parts of emission features at a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "hereafter , [ ] will refer to the @xmath41 line , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "pointed observations were made by alternating between a given sightline toward a selected feature , an direction , and an accompanying , usually nearby , direction .",
    "each pair of observations was observed for 120 s at a time ( to get well above the effective @xmath42  4 @xmath43  readnoise of wham s ccd ) with a total integration time of a few hours for the faintest lines ( e.g. , [ ] @xmath2 ) .",
    "the directions were chosen to be as spatially close to the direction as possible and to provide the off - source spectrum containing the atmospheric foreground and galactic background emissions .",
    "all of the observations were carried out during clear , dark of the moon nights to avoid the contribution of scattered solar and terrestrial lines in the spectra .",
    "the geocoronal h@xmath0  line , with @xmath16  @xmath31 5 - 10 r , is the strongest terrestrial emission line contaminating the galactic spectra .",
    "however , in addition to h@xmath0 , all of the spectra are contaminated by much weaker atmospheric lines , typically 5 - 7 with @xmath44 r and fwhm @xmath45 kms@xmath8  within the 200 kms@xmath8  spectral window",
    ". the positions of these lines , which are largely unidentified , are fixed with respect to a geocentric reference frame .",
    "their strength is observed to vary with both position in the sky and with time during the night , sometimes by up to a factor of two .",
    "however , their relative strengths do not appear to change by more than @xmath31 10% @xcite .    to remove this faint foreground emission in the survey mode observations ,",
    "an atmospheric line template was fitted to and then subtracted from each spectrum , in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "these templates were constructed by observing the faintest direction in the h@xmath0  sky , in multiple emission lines , for an entire night .",
    "this direction is near the lockman hole @xcite , and has a total h@xmath0  intensity of @xmath16  @xmath46  0.1 r @xcite .",
    "the average of the all the spectra had a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to reveal the location , width , and relative intensities of these atmospheric lines .",
    "an examination of the changes among individual spectra taken through the night confirmed the terrestrial origin of the lines and provided a measure of their overall strength . since the relative strengths of the lines appear to be constant , the template was multiplied by a single number , a scaling factor , for each block of survey mode observations .",
    "the value of this scaling factor was determined by matching the strengths of atmospheric lines in parts of block - averaged spectra that did not show any galactic emission .",
    "the scaled template was then subtracted from each spectrum in the block .    in pointed mode spectra ,",
    "the atmospheric lines were removed by subtracting an appropriate from the to produce a flat continuum .",
    "past exprience with this technique has shown that the degree to which the atmospheric emission in the spectrum represents the emission in the spectrum is usually the dominant source of uncertainty in the resulting galactic spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the large number of short exposure time observations employed in this study , combined with the alternating / observing technique yielded a very good subtraction of the atmospheric lines .",
    "some spectra were sensitive to lines as faint as @xmath47 r. this lower limit is set by random errors in the baseline as well as a slightly incomplete subtraction of the atmospheric lines .",
    "intensity calibration involved several steps .",
    "the h@xmath0  spectra were calibrated using synoptic observations of a portion of the north america nebula ( nan ) , which has an h@xmath0  surface brightness of @xmath16= 800 r with an uncertainty of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "all of the other emission line data were calibrated initially by determining the throughput of the spectrometer at the different emission line wavelengths relative to h@xmath0 .",
    "these included the quantum efficiency of the ccd , the transmission of the narrowband ( fwhm @xmath31 20 ) interference filters , the transmission of the atmosphere , and a correction for the properties of the wham optical train ( e.g. coatings , reflections , and transmission of the mirrors and lenses ) .",
    "the corrections for the ccd quantum efficiency and the interference filters were based on data provided by the manufacturers of those systems .",
    "the transmission of the atmosphere could not be well determined on a night - by - night basis , due to a lack of observations of a large number of calibration targets taken at a variety of airmasses each night . a few nights , however , were spent observing enough targets to determine the average relative transmission of the atmosphere .",
    "we determined an average zenith transmission that ranges from 94% at [ ]   to 85% at h@xmath49 .",
    "these data agree well with the standard atmospheric transmission curve at kitt peak that is included in the popular iraf data reduction package .",
    "we assumed that the relative transmission of the atmosphere was the same for each night of observing and that the atmosphere is plane - parallel .",
    "the correction for the transmission of the wham optics was determined empirically by using a combination of h@xmath0  and h@xmath49   observations toward a part of the large  region surrounding spica ( @xmath0 vir ) , a nearby b1  iii star . in the absence of extinction ,",
    "the photon number ratio of @xmath16  to @xmath50  of warm , low density photoionized gas is 3.94 , set by the ` case b ' recombination cascade of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "we assume that the emission from the spica  region suffers no extinction because of its proximity ( @xmath51 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , high galactic latitude ( @xmath52 ) , and the low interstellar hydrogen column density to the exciting star ( @xmath53@xmath54 ; * ? ? ?",
    "after applying the ccd , interference filter , and atmospheric corrections mentioned above , we found that the h@xmath49  spectra needed to by multiplied by an additional factor of 1.36 for the ratio of @xmath16/ @xmath50  to be equal to the expected value of 3.94 .",
    "we assume that this decrease in transmission from the red to the blue is linear with wavelength , and interpolate this correction for the other , redder , emission lines . as a consistency check ,",
    "fully corrected h@xmath0  and h@xmath49   spectra toward nan yielded an @xmath16/ @xmath50  ratio of 5.1 , consistent with observations of extinction toward stars in the nebula @xcite .",
    "the results presented in @xcite also confirm the validity of this calibration technique .",
    "note that nearly all the results presented here involve comparing line ratios in one emission region with the corresponding ratio in another region . as a result ,",
    "much of the analysis is insensitive to calibration errors between different wavelengths .",
    "the velocity calibrations of these spectra were derived from observations of bright , narrow emission line hii regions , and are based on the assumption that the emission from all of the lines from an individual  region are at the same velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . for h@xmath0 , h@xmath49 , and [ ] , relatively bright terrestrial emission lines within the spectra were used to confirm the calibration .",
    "the calibrations were also checked against an empirical prediction based on the tunes of the fabry - perot etalons ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) .",
    "the resulting systematic uncertainty is estimated to be typically 2 - 3 kilometers per second .",
    "the uncertainty in the velocity calibration due to random noise in the data is only a few tenths of a kilometer per second .",
    "one of the contributions to the uncertainty in emission line strengths comes from the random errors in measuring the level of the continuum .",
    "a least - squares linear fit was used to estimate the continuum level and remove it from each spectrum .",
    "however , there is scatter in the residual due to the poisson statistics of the detected photons as well as from the incomplete subtraction of the atmospheric lines .",
    "this scatter introduces an uncertainty when integrating the area under the emission line . in the pointed mode observations , this dominant source of uncertainty was generally @xmath55 r , and in some cases half of that value .",
    "the 1@xmath56 values are listed in tables  [ tab : hiibasic ] through [ tab : niiblue ] .",
    "for some observations , the measured line strength is negative , indicating a non - detection . in this case",
    "an upper limit to the line strength , equivalent to the 1@xmath56 uncertainty , is given in the tables .",
    "in the survey mode spectra , on the other hand , the large area of the sky observed in this mode prohibited an alternating / observing technique .",
    "also , these spectra were obtained with considerably shorter total exposure times and often have galactic emission present across much of the 200 kms@xmath8  spectral window . as a result ,",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in this mode is the removal of the atmospheric lines , which in turn depends upon the accuracy of the atmospheric line template and the uncerainty in its scaling factor .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainty in the scaling factor to be 30% , based on the visual appearance of the corrected spectra , as well as the values of the different scaling factors used in all of the spectra .",
    "the uncertainty varies with position within each spectrum , because the atmospheric lines only appear in certain places in each spectrum .",
    "the error bars that appear in the figures below for survey mode data represent this 30% uncertainty in the atmospheric scaling factor .",
    "the warm ionized medium is thought to be ionized primarily by lyman continuum photons from hot stars , although the mechanism by which this happens is largely unknown ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "therefore , to investigate the nature of the wim , it is useful to compare the observed emission line ratios in the faint diffuse emission regions with the corresponding ratios observed in the bright classical  regions immediately surrounding hot stars . in this section we discuss the results of emission line strengths of h@xmath49 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and  relative to h@xmath0  for a collection of 13 o - star  regions , plus two regions of ionized gas surrounding hot evolved stellar cores .",
    "some of these   regions ( immediately surrounding o stars in orion ob1 and cas ob6 ) are associated with much larger extended regions of filaments and loops , allowing us to explore the question of whether the diffuse wim is the superposition of such extended structures surrounding some o stars and o associations (   [ subsec : ori ] and [ subsec : per ] ) .",

    "this selection criteria was somewhat subjective , and many s were tens of degrees away from the  regions .",
    "however , the resulting line intensities are mostly insensitive to the selection of s , because the  region emission lines are much stronger than those of the background wim and the atmosphere .",

    "@xcite conducted a photometric study of this star cluster , and found considerable scatter in the visual absorption for member stars of the ob association , with a mean value of @xmath66 mag .",
    "if the emission from s292 suffers this same average extinction within the wham beam , than the extinction corrected value for @xmath16  is 514 r. the corrections for the line ratios are all smaller than the uncertainties , except for [ ] /h@xmath0  which increases from @xmath31  0.10 to 0.13 .",

    "the line strengths of [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and  emission relative to h@xmath0 , ( in energy units ) are presented in table  [ tab : hiimulti ] . for [ ] /h@xmath0 , we find that the average value for the o - star  regions is 0.27 . as will be seen in the following sections , this value is significantly lower than what is generally observed in the wim , where a typical value of [ ] /h@xmath0  is @xmath31 0.5 , but in some cases exceeds 1.0 .",
    "in addition , there is no strong trend in [ ] /h@xmath0  with spectral type .",
    "if [ ] /h@xmath0  is tracing the electron temperature of the gas , we might expect to see a slight decrease in [ ] /h@xmath0  with decreasing stellar temperature .",
    "however , the ionizing radiation from the hottest stars may have a significant flux above 29.6 ev ( as suggested by their higher [ ] /h@xmath0 ) , which can ionize n@xmath22 and thus complicate the relationship between electron temperature and [ ] /h@xmath0   ( eq . [ eq : niieq ] ) .",
    "for the three observations taken near the very large  region ionized by the o7.5iii star @xmath69 per ( s220 and sivan 4 ) , [ ] /h@xmath0  varies by almost a factor of two , from 0.23 to 0.40 , with the brightest portion of the region , often referred to as the california nebula , having the highest ratio .",

    "the horizontal line in each panel denotes the average value for that particular line ratio .    for [ ] /h@xmath0 , we find an average value of 0.11 for the o - star   regions .",
    "this value is also significantly lower than what is generally found in the wim , consistent with previous studies . because of the low ionization potential of s@xmath22 , [ ] /h@xmath0  is more sensitive to ionization effects that [ ] /h@xmath0 .",
    "however we do not see any strong trends in this ratio with spectral type of the ionizing sources .",

    "these two  regions were first noted by @xcite , in a preliminary search of the wham - nss for faint h@xmath0   emission near hot white dwarf and sub - dwarf stars .",
    "a more thorough search of the h@xmath0  survey has revealed numerous small ( @xmath70 ) scale h@xmath0   enhancements , many of which are not associated with any known ionizing source @xcite .",
    "the detection of enhanced h@xmath0  emission around the @xmath71 star pg 1047 + 003 is the first detection of ionized gas surrounding this sub - dwarf b star .",
    "the emission associated with do star pg 1034 + 01 near @xmath30= ( 248@xmath15,+48@xmath15 ) has been recently explored by @xcite and @xcite , who conclude that this region is a high - excitation , planetary - nebula like object .",
    "the line ratios , particularly the high values of [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0 , toward both of these regions are consistent with planetary nebula spectra .",
    "we now proceed to compare the spectral characteristics of these classical  regions with those of the much of larger scale emission features revealed by the wham h@xmath0  survey , including the diffuse wim .",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] and [ sec : physconds ] , the spectral characteristics of the wim differ significantly from the classical  regions .",
    "this has been discussed in detail in earlier studies ( e.g. , haffner et al 1999 ) . as an illustration of the principal difference between wim and   region spectra , we show h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ]  observations toward the o star  region sivan 2 in figure  [ fig : wimspectra ] .",
    "two radial velocity components are present along this line of sight .",
    "velocity channel maps from the wham survey show that the emission near @xmath72= 0 kms@xmath8  is associated with diffuse foreground emission ( i.e. , the local wim ) .",
    "this emission was well separated in velocity from the  region emission , allowing a direct comparison of the relative intensities of the lines from the two different sources in the same spectrum .",
    "the velocity of each component was determined from a least - squares fit of a sum of gaussian profiles to the [ ]  spectrum .",
    "the [ ]  spectrum was chosen because of its narrow , well - resolved component profiles and its high signal - to - noise .",
    "the resulting component velocities are shown as vertical dashed lines in the figure .",
    "the strength of each component was calculated from a two - component gaussian fit to each spectrum in which the velocities for each component were fixed as determined from the [ ]  spectrum .",
    "these spectra clearly reveal that [ ]  @xmath736584/h@xmath0 , [ ]   @xmath735775/h@xmath0 , and [ ] /h@xmath0  are significantly higher in the diffuse gas compared to the  region , with [ ] /h@xmath0  = 0.83 and [ ] /h@xmath0= 0.38 in the wim , compared to 0.23 and 0.12 , respectively , for the   region .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0  data suggest that the temperature of the diffuse gas is @xmath74  9000 k , compared to @xmath31  6100 k for the   region .",
    "the high temperature derived for the wim relative to the   region , from the [ ] @xmath736584/h@xmath0  ratio (  [ sec : physconds ] ) , is confirmed by observations of the highly temperature sensitive [ ] @xmath2   emission line .",
    "these observations show relatively bright [ ] @xmath2   emission for the fainter ( in h@xmath0 ) wim component , while the [ ] @xmath2  line is not even detected in the cooler  region component ( see also  [ sec : niiblue ] below ) .",
    "additional differences between the  regions , the wim , and other faint , large - scale emission features in the h@xmath0  sky are discussed in the following sections . for this paper",
    ", the ` wim ' refers to the gas that produces the faint , diffuse emission outside the classical regions , extended bubbles and superbubbles , and high latitude filamentary structures .",
    "one of the basic questions concerning the nature of the wim is how ionizing photons from o stars are able to travel hundreds of parsecs from the stars .",
    "one possibility is the existence of enormous -free bubbles surrounding some of the o stars . in ",
    "[ subsec : ori ] and  [ subsec : per ] , we examine in detail the faint optical line emission associated with two very extended bubble - like regions which have diameters of @xmath27 40@xmath15  - 60@xmath15  ( up to 2 kpc in extent ) and which are ionized by luminous o associations .",
    "the line ratios are then compared with ratios in the more diffuse wim to examine whether the wim could be a superposition of such regions .",
    "one of the largest networks of interconnected h@xmath0-emitting structures in the wham sky survey appears in the constellations of orion and eridanus , shown in figure  [ fig : orimap ] .",
    "the presence of optical and radio - emitting filaments in this general direction has been known for many years .",
    "@xcite carried out velocity resolved emission - line observations of this region , and found that the filaments , loops , and enhanced h@xmath0  emission are all part of an expanding shell of neutral and ionized gas with a diameter of @xmath75 pc .",
    "they suggested that lyman continuum photons from the ori ob1 association , located near one side of the bubble , travel largely unimpeded through the hot ( @xmath76  k ) interior cavity and ionize the inner surface of its surrounding outer shell .",
    "they estimated the shell has a density near 1 @xmath9 , which is significantly higher than the density in the wim ; nevertheless , the large extent of the cavity has produced diffuse and filamentary h@xmath0   covering a @xmath77 region of the sky and up to 34@xmath15  from the ob association .",
    "this picture is supported by the detection of diffuse x - ray emission interior to the bubble walls , as well as more recent studies of  in the region @xcite .",
    "the shell is expanding at a velocity of about 20 kms@xmath8 , likely as a result of supernova activity ; however , @xcite have shown that the contribution from shocks to the ionization of the walls of the bubble is likely to be negligible .",
    "they found that among the most luminous stars within the bubble , @xmath78 ori , an o9.5  i star , is probably responsible for most of the ionization .",
    "it is the only hot star in the cavity that has no discrete  region around it , implying that most of its ionizing radiation travels unimpeded through the cavity .",
    "the orion - eridanus bubble , which is significantly brighter in h@xmath0  compared to the more diffuse wim , is thus an excellent environment in which to study the relationship between traditional  regions and the warm ionized medium . by comparing the physical conditions within , around , and outside this bubble",
    ", we can assess the similarities and differences between gas that is part of a large cavity ionized by a known source and the fainter , diffuse wim .",

    "the bubble is outlined approximately by a circle that goes through directions a , 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 , and g. direction 3 is located _ outside _ of the boundary and samples diffuse interstellar gas near the galactic plane .",
    "the numbered directions are ordered with increasing distance from the orion ob1 association , located near @xmath56 ori and its  region , which is indicated on the diagram with the letter @xmath56 .",
    "a set of seven closely spaced observations were also made that cut across a filament near the lower edge of the bubble , and are labeled a - g .",
    "two directions denoted by ` x ' were used as s for the reduction of the pointed observation spectra .",
    "the offs have an h@xmath0  intensity of @xmath31 0.5 r , and subtracting them from the ons allows us to isolate emission in the bubble from any background or foreground emission . the green box in figure  [ fig : orimap ]",
    "indicates a region of the bubble that also was mapped in [ ]  and [ ] .",
    "table  [ tab : ori ] summarizes our pointed observations of this region , with the name of each direction corresponding to the labels in figure  [ fig : orimap ] .",
    "the columns in the table are similar to those in tables  [ tab : hiibasic ] and [ tab : hiimulti ] .",
    "however , the fourth column shows the angular distance of each direction from @xmath30= ( 206.5@xmath15 ,  -18.0@xmath15 ) , the h@xmath0  flux - weighted center of the bubble , as determined by @xcite and roughly the center of the orion ob 1 association .",
    "the spectrum toward direction 1 has two emission components ; the emission line strengths that appear in the table include the total emission from both components .",
    "also , because of the weak dependence of the line ratios on @xmath61 , and the low extinction to this nearby region ( @xmath61@xmath27 0.15 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no extinction correction was applied to the data . as discussed in  [ sec : obs ] , spectra were subtracted from each of these pointed observations , and all of the results in the table represent ` background subtracted ' values .",
    "this procedure isolates emission that is only associated with the orion - eridanus bubble .",
    "a graphical summary of the line ratios is shown in figure  [ fig : oridiag ] .",
    "the panel on the left includes the observations that are within or on the boundary of the bubble ( 1 - 7 ) , except for direction 3 .",
    "the panel on the right shows the results for the series of observations that cut across the outermost filament at @xmath79 ( a - g ) , which appears to be an edge - on projection of the cavity s outer shell .",
    "these pointings , spaced about 1@xmath15  apart , begin on one side of the h@xmath0   filament ( the side toward the o association ) , cross the filament , and end just outside the ionized part of the bubble ( see  [ subsubsec : orisurv ] ) .",
    "the column density of from @xcite , is also shown in the panel on the right ( _ green _ ) , and indicates the location of the neutral portion of the shell .",
    "the name of each observation direction appears above the panels .",
    "the data are shown as a function of @xmath80 , the angular distance from the center of the ob1 association , which is useful in order to search for potential changes in the physical conditions of the gas with increasing distance from the ionizing source .",
    "the top plot in each panel shows the h@xmath0  intensity toward each direction on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the second plot from the top shows the values of [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0 , while the third and fourth plots give [ ] /h@xmath0  and /h@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the horizontal line in each plot represents the average value for the ratio in  regions ( table  [ tab : hiimulti ] ; figure  [ fig : hiisummary ] ) ; for [ ] /h@xmath0 , the  region average , 0.094 , is off scale .    for directions 1 - 7",
    ", we see that [ ] /h@xmath0  varies between @xmath31 0.2 to 0.3 , and there is no significant correlation with @xmath80 out to @xmath81 from the association .",
    "the ratio is weakly anti - correlated with @xmath16 , with brighter regions of the bubble having lower values of [ ] /h@xmath0 .",
    "this is a common behavior seen in these bubble structures and in the wim , both for the milky way and other galaxies @xcite .",
    "[ ] /h@xmath0  is near the value of the average  region , and slightly lower than in the @xmath56 ori  region , which appears to reside inside ( or perhaps on the wall of ) the cavity . the variation in [ ] /h@xmath0   ( @xmath31 0.15 - 0.25 ) is larger than for [ ] /h@xmath0 , and there is a very weak trend in which [ ] /h@xmath0  is higher at larger distances from the association , where it becomes larger than the average ratio in classical   regions . the ratio [ ] / [ ]  also increases with @xmath80 , from 0.55 for direction 1 to 0.95 in direction 6 . as will be seen later , [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  in the bubble are generally lower and exhibit less scatter than the ratios observed in the wim .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0  ratio is extremely low throughout the bubble , @xmath82 , with the exception of direction 4 ( direction 3 is outside the bubble ) , and is an order of magnitude below the average value of 0.18 for the  regions ( table  [ tab : hiimulti ] ) .",
    "similarly , the /h@xmath0  ratios are low ( @xmath83 ) relative to the  region average .    based upon the discussion presented in  [ sec : hii ] ,",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] / [ ]  data suggest that the temperature of the ionized gas is between @xmath84 with @xmath85 . in addition",

    "the ratio of total number of he - ionizing photons @xmath87(he@xmath88 ) to h - ionizing photons @xmath87(h@xmath88 ) along the line of sight is then proportional to this volume ratio , specifically @xmath87(he@xmath88)/@xmath87(h@xmath88 ) @xmath46 0.03 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a star with an effective temperature @xmath89 35,000 k , equivalent to o8.5  i or o9.5  v or cooler @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the likely ionizing source of the shell , @xmath78  ori , which is an o9.5i star , although further analysis using recent stellar atmosphere models is needed to confirm this scenario @xcite .",
    "the low he@xmath22/he is consistent with the apparently low ionization state of oxygen , where [ ] /h@xmath0  suggests that o@xmath23/o @xmath46  0.04 ( exception for direction 4 , where o@xmath23/o @xmath31  0.1 ) . outside the bubble and closer to the galactic plane ( direction 3 ) , he@xmath22/he @xmath90 , suggesting that the radiation field outside the shell is significantly harder , consistent with a continuum source with @xmath91 @xmath92 40,000 k , an o7 star or earlier .",
    "the data on the right panel in figure  [ fig : oridiag ] show the variation in the line ratios across the outer edge of the bubble , where the hydrogen in the shell is making a transition from fully ionized ( on the shell s inside surface ) to completely neutral . here",
    "we see small , but significant trends in the ratios of [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  across this outer filament , which is a projection enhancement from an edge - on view of the shell .",
    "the ratio of [ ] /h@xmath0  follows the variation in [ ] /h@xmath0  very closely , with [ ] / [ ]  @xmath31 1.0 , except for the direction inside ( a ) , where [ ] / [ ]  @xmath31 0.7 .",
    "interestingly , the data show that this filament is brightest in [ ]  and [ ]  ( is highest in temperature ? ) at a different location than the brightest part in h@xmath0 , with [ ]  and [ ]   both peaking about @xmath93  pc further away from the ionizing source(s ) .",
    "the peak brightness of  is even farther to the outside , near direction g. these trends are also shown in the line ratio maps of this region presented below . both [ ]  and  are very weak and show no clear trends across the filament .",
    "we note that while there are statistically significant trends in [ ] /h@xmath0   and [ ] /h@xmath0  across the outer edge of the shell , the magnitude of the variations are small . as a result ,",
    "changes in the physical conditions , as suggested by the line ratios , are not very dramatic .",
    "potential complications introduced by the unknown geometry and multi - phase nature of the bubble could be important when using the observed line ratios to infer changes in the actual physical conditions . for example",
    ", small variations in the volume - averaged ionization fractions of both n and s along the lines of sight may complicate our interpretation that [ ] /h@xmath0  is tracing the temperature of the gas .",
    "however , the constancy of [ ] / [ ]  strongly indicates that the variations in [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  are dominated by variations in temperature ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : siieq ] ) .",
    "if we assume that n@xmath22/n = 0.8 everywhere across the shell , then the [ ] /h@xmath0  data suggest that the temperature of the warm ionized gas associated with the edge of this bubble is @xmath94 k toward direction a , falling to @xmath31   6000 k at the inside edge of the filament , and rising back up to about 6300  k before falling back down to near 6000  k just outside the shell .",
    "this apparent rise in temperature toward the backside of the h@xmath0  filament ( farther away from the ionizing source ) could be due to a slight hardening of the radiation as it penetrates into the shell and just before it is completely absorbed where the shell becomes neutral @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : oriratiomap ] shows a more comprehensive picture of the [ ]  and [ ]  emission in this region , obtained in survey mode .",
    "the figure contains maps of the h@xmath0  and  intensity , [ ] /h@xmath0 , [ ] /h@xmath0 , and [ ] / [ ] .",
    "the maps were created by integrating the emission lines over their entire profiles , between @xmath95 of the lsr .",
    "the blue contours outline the location of strong 21 cm emission from @xcite , the outermost , neutral portion of the shell , with the contour levels corresponding to column densities of 5.6 , 6 , 7 , 9 , and 11@xmath96  @xmath54 .",
    "the green circles represent the pointed observations a - g discussed above .",
    "this @xmath97 view also includes a large region outside of the shell to higher ( more negative than -52@xmath15 ) galactic latitude , dominated by the faint , diffuse wim .",
    "the trends that were found for the pointed directions that traverse the outer edge of the bubble are also apparent in these survey mode observations .",
    "however , the maps in figure  [ fig : oriratiomap ] reveal that these trends hold across the entirety of the shell edge , and not just for one slice through it .",
    "the h@xmath0  map in figure  [ fig : oriratiomap ] shows that the ionized gas associated with the edge of the bubble lies a few degrees inside of the neutral  edge , and decreases in intensity before the peak in  emission , as was also shown in figure  [ fig : oridiag ] .",
    "also , note the ridge of enhanced [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  at @xmath98 that runs parallel to , and just between , the h@xmath0  and 21 cm bright parts of the outer shell .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0  map shows a striking anti - correlation between the h@xmath0  line strength and the [ ] /h@xmath0  line ratio .",
    "for example , the very faint wim emission outside the bubble at @xmath99 is the  brightest \" region in the [ ] /h@xmath0  map .",
    "in addition , several individual features _ inside _ of the bubble show this anti - correlation , such as the region of depressed h@xmath0  emission near @xmath30= ( 187@xmath15 , -47@xmath15 ) and the region of enhanced h@xmath0  emission near @xmath30  = ( 198@xmath15 ,  -41@xmath15 ) .",
    "interestingly , a spatially coherent depression in [ ] /h@xmath0  follows the shape of the outer edge of the bubble , where the  is getting brighter ( i.e. , directions f and g ) .",
    "this suggests a decrease in temperature ( or a decrease in n@xmath22 relative to h@xmath22 ) in the transition region from  to  in this outer shell .",
    "the data are consistent with this bubble being a large , hot cavity with the inside walls ionized by hot stars within the cavity , as originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath0  map is very similar to the [ ] /h@xmath0  map .",
    "we see that the diffuse background is significantly brighter in [ ] /h@xmath0  than the rest of the bubble .",
    "we also see a dark filament that is nearly co - spatial with the  shell .",
    "this dark filament is similar to the feature in the [ ] /h@xmath0  map , but seems to be of a higher contrast relative to its surroundings .",
    "the [ ] / [ ]  map shows that the interior of the shell has an elevated [ ] / [ ]  line ratio ( i.e. , a lower ionization of sulfur ) than in the wim at @xmath99 .",
    "we note that the coherent features in both the [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  maps are well above the noise , although the numerical variation in the ratios is small ( 67% of the data span a range of @xmath31 0.10 in the ratio ) .",
    "the interpretation of these maps is complicated by the presence of the background ( wim ) emission .",
    "these maps are as they appear in the sky , and no background emission has been subtracted from them as was done for the pointed observations . because [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  are relatively high in the background , the faint [ ]  and [ ]  emission inside and near the edge of the bubble is not a representation of emission from the bubble alone .",
    "the average strength of the h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ]  emission in the background is 0.99 , 0.35 , and 0.26 r , respectively .",
    "therefore , because the [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios are higher in the background than within the orion - eridanus bubble , the values for the actual ratios associated with the bubble features in figure  [ fig : oriratiomap ] are slightly lower than that given by the color bars .",
    "that is , there is an even greater difference between the ionized gas associated with the bubble and the wim than these maps indicate .",
    "another visualization of the data in these maps is presented in figure  [ fig : oriratioplot ] . here , the ratios [ ] /h@xmath0 , [ ] /h@xmath0 , and [ ] / [ ]   are plotted against h@xmath0  intensity for every direction in figure  [ fig : oriratiomap ] .",
    "the total ( random and systematic ) uncertainties in the data points are shown in the top two panels , with their origin and magnitude discussed in  [ sec : errors ] .",
    "the uncertainty in [ ] / [ ]  has been omitted for clarity .",
    "the data have been separated by latitude , with observations outside the bubble ( @xmath100 ) shown in red ( wim ) and observations inside the bubble ( @xmath101 ) shown in blue . for comparison ,",

    "these plots show an increase in [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  in parts of the map with the faintest h@xmath0  emission outside of the bubble , and that [ ] / [ ]  is significantly higher than the average  region .",
    "we also see that the scatter in these ratios at low @xmath16  is similar to the scatter at higher @xmath16 .",
    "this scatter is significantly larger than the random uncertainties in the data .    a useful diagram that separates the effects of temperature from the effects of ionization state is shown in figure  [ fig : orirationvs ] , where [ ] /h@xmath0  is plotted against [ ] /h@xmath0 , using equations [ eq : niieq ] and [ eq : siieq ] after the fashion presented in @xcite .",
    "the vertical dashed lines represent the expected ratio of [ ] /h@xmath0  for temperatures from 5000  k to 10,000  k. the solid lines represent the expected ratio of [ ] / [ ]  for an increasing fraction of s@xmath22/s between zero and 1.0 .",
    "the symbols are the same as figure  [ fig : oriratioplot ] , except that the ratios for the o star  regions from  [ sec : hii ] have also been added and are shown individually in green .",
    "the data suggest that on average , the ionized gas in the bubble ( _ blue _ ) has a larger fraction of s in the form of s@xmath22 compared to the  regions ( 50% vs. 25% ) , and is similar to that in the wim ( _ red _ ) .",
    "the data also suggest that most of the gas within the bubble is at  region - like temperatures ( 6000 k @xmath102 7000 k ) , significantly lower than in the fainter , more diffuse wim gas outside the bubble .      in summary , at this point",
    "we conclude that although the low ionization state of the warm ionized gas in the orion - eridanus bubble ( i.e. , enhanced [ ] /h@xmath0  and low [ ] /h@xmath0 ) is similar to that in the fainter , more diffuse wim , the temperature ( [ ] /h@xmath0 ) appears to be consistently lower than that in the wim and close to the value found for the classical  regions .",
    "the lower ionization state of the gas compared to the average classical  region is probably the result of the late spectral type ( soft ionizing spectrum ) of the primary ionizing star and the low ionization parameter associated with the dilution of the ionizing radiation as it travels to the distant walls of the cavity .",
    "the decrease in ionization parameter could explain the weak rise in [ ] /h@xmath0   with distance from ori ob1 .",
    "on the other hand , we find no evidence for the [ ] /h@xmath0  ratio becoming more wim - like with increasing distance from the o association , even at the outer edge , @xmath103 ( at least 250 pc ) distant .",
    "while there is a small increase in both [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  at the transition from ionized to neutral gas within the outer shell , [ ] /h@xmath0   never approaches the high values found in the more diffuse ionized gas outside the bubble .",
    "thus it appears that the spectral characteristics of the wim are not explained by the leakage of o star radiation onto cavity walls like those of the orion - eridanus bubble .      to investigate whether the size of the bubble influences the emission line ratios , we examine next a much larger ( 2000 pc @xmath20 800 pc ) and fainter superbubble ionized by the cas ob6 association and covering much of the constellations perseus , cassiopeia , and camelopardalis .",
    "we will refer to this enormous structure as the `` perseus superbubble '' .",

    "the lower [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios in the filamentary structures , particularly in the brighter h@xmath0  regions south of the plane where contamination by the fainter wim along the line of sight is negligible , provides strong evidence that these filaments are not enhancements resulting from folds and edge projections of the ionized outer skin of the superbubble but instead are regions of cooler temperature .",
    "furthermore , the generally lower [ ] /h@xmath0  within the entire superbubble compared to that in the more diffuse wim at @xmath119 , for example , implies that the wim can not be explained entirely by the superposition of regions like the perseus superbubble .",
    "in the [ ] /h@xmath0  map the contrast between the filaments and the background is not as high . since the line ratio [ ] /h@xmath0  is a combination of temperature and ionization effects , this decrease in contrast may be due to changes in the ionization fraction of s@xmath22/s that ` wash out ' the temperature effects we see in the [ ] /h@xmath0  map .",

    "we note one caveat about our analysis of the complicated component structure toward these lines of sight .",

    "spectra separated by only 1@xmath15  in this area show variations in the component strengths by a factor of 2 and shifts in the velocity centroids of 10 kms@xmath8  or more .",
    "therefore , in some cases a map that covers a fixed radial velocity interval may sample the entire emission component in one part of the map , but only the wing of that component in another part of the map .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the line ratios . a detailed examination of the emission , including a study of the dynamics of the gas , would require gaussian fits to all of the components in all of the approximately 2400 spectra , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "our focus here is limited to the general trends that appear among spatially coherent features in these maps , which are insensitive to these kinematic variations .",
    "compared to the smaller and brighter orion - eridanus bubble , the perseus superbubble is clearly more wim - like . compare , for example , the distribution of blue points in figures  [ fig : oriratioplot ] and [ fig : orirationvs ] ( orion - eridanus bubble ) with the blue points in the corresponding figures  [ fig : bowtieratioper ] and [ fig : bowtieratiopernvs ] ( perseus superbubble ) . because the surface brightness of the perseus superbubble is not much brighter than that of the wim , particularly far from the galactic plane , searching for a trend in the line ratios with distance from cas ob6 is problematic . however",

    "nevertheless , even the most distant parts of the superbubble are still clearly distinguishable from the background wim , indicating that although this structure does have ratios similar to the wim in some regions of the sky ( e.g. , outside the orion - eridanus bubble at @xmath100 ) , there is still a significant difference ( which we interpret primarily as a temperature difference ) between this superbubble and the adjacent wim .",
    "there are other regions of the sky that exhibit h@xmath0  enhancements with no identified o stars or o associations as their source of ionization .",
    "many of these are high galactic latitude filamentary structures that have no visible connection to a superbubble .",

    "a radial velocity gradient along the length of the vertical filament , from @xmath124 kms@xmath8  near the midplane to @xmath131 kms@xmath8  at the highest latitude , suggests that it is a coherent strand of gas and not simply an enhancement resulting from an increase in geometrical path through the edge of a very low surface brightness shell .",

    "@xcite suggest that the diffuse ionized gas in these filaments is not likely to be material that has been ejected from the star - forming region below it . instead , they argue that the relatively constant h@xmath0  surface brightness along the filament suggests that it is ionized by ambient lyman continuum radiation .",

    "in contrast to the other emission lines , [ ] /h@xmath0  shows a very strong trend with distance , with [ ] /h@xmath0  @xmath139 near the midplane , where its value is the same as that toward the  region s292 , falling to @xmath31  0.025 at b , 24@xmath15(@xmath31  400 pc ) above the midplane , and dropping to values below or at 0.01 for the two highest latitude directions .",
    "this implies that o@xmath23/o @xmath31 0.1 at @xmath140  pc , @xmath31 0.04 at 400 pc , and @xmath46  0.02 above 700 pc .",
    "this is contrasted with the generally observed behavior of [ ]  in external galaxies , where the [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios are much higher ( @xmath92  0.2 ) and in some cases increase with distance above the plane @xcite .",
    "if the filament is photoionized and its temperature is not changing with height above the plane , as the constant [ ] /h@xmath0  suggests , then these [ ] /h@xmath0  data suggest that an already low flux of photons having @xmath141  35 ev rapidly diminishes with increasing height above the plane .",
    "the /h@xmath0  ratio for direction b , while quite uncertain , implies that there are a significant number of he - ionizing photons ( @xmath142  ev ) at @xmath143  pc , with he@xmath22/he @xmath31  0.6 @xmath42 0.2 . this is higher than what is seen for many  regions , and implies that the ionizing radiation field at this location has a spectrum that is similar to an o7 star or earlier .",
    "we also investigated a much shorter filamentary feature , a @xmath27  3@xmath15   long arc of h@xmath0  emission located near @xmath30= ( 171@xmath15 , + 57@xmath15 ) about @xmath144@xmath15  away from the faintest directions in the sky in both h@xmath0  and  @xcite .",

    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : lockmap ] shows the same piece of sky , but for the velocity interval @xmath148 .",
    "fortuitously , the line of sight through the arc also passes through a faint portion of an intermediate - velocity  cloud ( ivc ) known as the iv arch located approximately @xmath149 pc above the galactic midplane @xcite .",

    "the iv arch is typically @xmath151 wide and extends more than 60@xmath15  across the northern galactic hemisphere .",
    "a small section of the iv arch extends down away from the main section and passes through the direction of the lower velocity high - latitude h@xmath0  arc .",
    "the h@xmath0  intensity of the iv arch in this direction is approximately 0.1  r , making it the faintest h@xmath0  emission structure in this study , with a density of @xmath152 @xmath9 .",
    "we have observed emission lines of h@xmath0 , [ ] , [ ] , , and [ ]  and measured the line strengths for these two velocity components .",
    "a summary of the observations appears in the bottom two rows of table  [ tab : nfil ] .",
    "the low velocity arc has [ ] /h@xmath0  =  0.72 and [ ] / [ ]  =  0.65 , which are comparable to some of the highest values observed in the wim .",
    "the detection of [ ] @xmath2  confirms that these high ratios are primarily a result of an elevated temperature in the gas ( see  [ sec : niiblue ] ) .",
    "the relatively low [ ] /h@xmath0  ( @xmath31 0.06 ) is also consistent with the wim . however , /h@xmath0  ( @xmath153 ) is the highest ratio among all the observations in this study including the classical  regions .",
    "together , these line ratios suggest that this arc is ionized by a hard radiation source with a low flux that is local to the arc . the very high",
    "/h@xmath0  ratio is not seen elsewhere in the wim , and indicate the arc is not a density enhancement ionized only by the diffuse interstellar radiation field .",
    "the  data imply the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum .    a search for a potential ionizing source yielded one candidate , the da white dwarf wd1026 + 453 .",
    "this star has a visual magnitude @xmath154 and is near the arc at ( 170.92@xmath15 , + 56.60@xmath15 ) .",
    "it is the only spectroscopically confirmed hot star that lies within the arc ( in projection ) and within the field of view of the pointed observations discussed above .",
    "ultraviolet spectroscopy suggests that the temperature of the star is @xmath155 35,000 k and that it is at a distance of @xmath31 200 pc @xcite .",
    "it has also been detected in extreme ultraviolet by rosat and euve @xcite .",
    "emission line maps in this region show a slight enhancement in 21 cm line emission at the velocities of the ionized gas on the lower right side of the arc .",
    "if we adopt the above distance , the emission measure suggests the density of the gas in the arc is approximately 0.9 @xmath9 .",
    "the identification of wd1026 + 453 as the potential ionizing source for the arc raises the question about the contribution from hot evolved stellar cores to the diffuse ionizing radiation field above the galactic disk .",
    "the high /h@xmath0  for this region suggests that a future , more comprehensive study of  emission at high latitudes could provide insights about the role of such stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the rapid decrease in [ ] /h@xmath0  with latitude along the vertical northern filament strongly suggests that the radiation field , at least in that part of the galaxy , actually softens with distance from the midplane .",
    "the detections of [ ]  and [ ]  in the @xmath156 kms@xmath8  component are the first detections of these diagnostic emission lines from the iv arch . no corresponding [ ]  and  emission were detected .",
    "the very high value of [ ] / [ ]  ( @xmath157 ) is unique .",
    "we caution that because the h@xmath0   emission in this component is only @xmath31  0.1 r , the uncertainty in this result is substantial .",
    "however , at the 1@xmath56 limits , for both [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0 , [ ] / [ ]  @xmath92  1.0 .",
    "these ratios suggest that the temperature of the emitting gas is about 7000  k and that almost all of the s is singly ionized , with s@xmath22/s @xmath158 .",
    "the abundances that we use to infer these physical conditions (  [ sec : physconds ] ) are supported by uv absorption lines studies @xcite , which show that the iv arch has a gas phase abundances similar to that in the local ism .",
    "the ionization state could be unusually low due to the weak flux of ionizing radiation ( and thus low ionization parameter ) inferred from its very low h@xmath0  surface brightness ( 0.1 r ) .    in summary ,",
    "the northern filaments , the high latitude arc , and the iv arch are all characterized by high [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios that are not unlike the ratios observed in the more diffuse wim .",
    "many observations show that in faint , diffuse emission regions , the ratio [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath0 , tends to be significantly larger than in classical  regions and increases with decreasing h@xmath0   surface brightness .",
    "this is a general result that is commonly observed in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in external galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the interpretation is that ionized gas at lower densities ( specifically at n@xmath159 @xmath9 ) is at higher temperatures .",
    "furthermore , this increase in temperature may be beyond what can be attributed to photoionization alone @xcite , which has important implications for the role of other heating processes that may be operating in the wim .",
    "however , the [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath0  line ratio is a function of several physical parameters , not just temperature .",
    "therefore it is important to test this interpretation of elevated temperatures using other observational information .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : physconds ] , the ratio [ ] @xmath29/[]@xmath2  provides a direct measure of the electron temperature of the emitting gas .",
    "here we describe our observations of these lines toward a collection of classical o star  regions as well as sightlines that sample the diffuse wim .",
    "table  [ tab : niiblue ] summarizes the observations .",
    "the first 11 rows show the data for the  regions , including the five  regions reported earlier by @xcite .",
    "the last 6 rows show the data obtained for sightlines that sample the much fainter diffuse ionized medium .",
    "one wim sightline , ( 130@xmath15 , @xmath123@xmath15 ) , was reported previously by @xcite .",
    "for some directions , [ ] @xmath2  was not detected , and only upper limits to the line ratio of [ ] @xmath2/[]@xmath29 are given , as described in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] .",
    "the temperatures inferred by these line ratios appear in the last two two columns on the right .",
    "@xmath160 is the temperature suggested by the [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath0  ratio ; @xmath161 is the temperature inferred from the [ ] @xmath2/[]@xmath29 observations .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fig : bluenii ] , where [ ] @xmath2/[]@xmath29 is plotted against [ ] @xmath29/h@xmath0 .",
    "data for the  regions have blue symbols and the wim red symbols .",
    "upper limits to the line ratios are indicated by arrows .",
    "the solid black line is the locus of expected ratios of these lines from equations [ eq : niieq ] and [ eq : niiblueeq ] .",
    "the dashed lines show the predicted ratios for temperatures between 5000 and 10000 k. for the three wim sightlines in which [ ] @xmath2  is detected , both of the line ratios are significantly higher than those for classical o star  regions .",
    "this provides convincing confirmation that 1 ) the wim is approximately @xmath162  k warmer than classical o star  regions , and 2 ) higher [ ] /h@xmath0  intensity ratios are due at least in large part to higher temperatures .",
    "the data points tend to lie preferentially above the expected relationship ( solid line ) .",
    "this could be explained if n@xmath22/n in the wim were significantly lower than the assumed value of 0.8 . a ratio of n@xmath22/n = 0.6 would bring the two temperature diagnostics into average agreement with one another .",
    "however , both photoionization modeling @xcite and observations of elevated [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios suggest that the wim , and in particular the wim nitrogen , is not highly ionized",
    ". another reason could be that the gas phase abundance of nitrogen in the wim is lower than in the  regions by a factor of @xmath92  2 , which also seems improbable .",
    "the most likely explanation is that there is a range of temperatures in the wim @xcite , as is indicated by the large scatter in [ ] /h@xmath0  ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : alldiag]b ) . the metastable level of the [ ] @xmath2  line lies higher above ground ( about 4 ev ) than that of the [ ] @xmath29  line ( about 2 ev ) , which means that [ ] @xmath2  is preferentially produced in regions of higher temperature along the line of sight .",
    "the deviation of the points from the solid line can be explained with an appropriate ( non - unique ) range of temperatures @xcite .",
    "the conclusion that variations in [ ] /h@xmath0  trace variations in temperature has also been confirmed by the recent detection and study of [ ] @xmath733727 emission from the wim @xcite .",
    "we have presented a large number of new observations of several optical emission lines toward h@xmath0-emitting features in the galaxy that span a wide range in surface brightness , angular scale , environment , and morphology .",
    "we have explored the relative intensities of these emission lines to infer the physical conditions of the emitting gas , and we have compared these conditions with those of traditional , o star  regions in an attempt to gain insight into the nature of the wim and its relationship to hot stars and large - scale bubbles and filaments within the interstellar medium .",
    "we found significant variations in the temperature and ionization state among these emission features , revealing that warm ionized gas is heterogeneous in nature .",
    "we have strengthened the general assertion that the wim is warmer and less ionized compared to classical  regions and found significant variations in temperature and ionization state _ within _ the diffuse wim .",
    "an overview of some of these observations is presented in figure  [ fig : alldiag ] , which shows the diagnostic plots of [ ] /h@xmath0   vs. [ ] /h@xmath0  for various emission regions observed in pointed and survey mode .",
    "the dashed vertical and solid sloped lines represent lines of constant temperature and constant s@xmath22/s , respectively , and have the same values as in figures  [ fig : orirationvs ] , [ fig : bowtieratiolocalnvs ] , and [ fig : bowtieratiopernvs ] .",
    "the range of physical conditions is indicated by the different distributions and by the scatter in the data points .",
    "different types of emission regions occupy different areas of the diagram , and even within a given catagory of emission region , variations can be significant .",
    "the classical o star  regions ( except for the two regions ionized by hot stellar cores ) show the least variation ( figure  [ fig : alldiag]a ) , with temperatures between 6000  k and 7000  k and s@xmath22/s @xmath163 .",
    "in contrast , the faint diffuse wim ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alldiag]b ) has the most variation ; that is , it occupies the largest area , with temperatures ranging between 7000  k and 10,000  k and s@xmath22/s ranging from about 0.1 to 1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : alldiag]b also shows that the mean properties of the wim can be slightly different in different regions of the galaxy . for example , in the perseus arm s@xmath22/s in the wim has an average near 0.25 , while in the more nearby gas toward that direction , its average is near 0.6 .    from this study",
    ", we make the following closing statements :    \\1 .",
    "the temperature of diffuse ionized gas is higher in regions of lower emission measure .",
    "this is implied by the elevated [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios toward the relatively faint perseus superbubble , high latitude filaments , and diffuse background wim , compared to the relatively bright orion - eridanus bubble and the even brighter o star  regions .",
    "the relation between temperature ( traced by [ ] /h@xmath0 ) and h@xmath0  intensity also holds within the diffuse wim itself ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : oriratioplot ] , [ fig : bowtieratiolocal ] , and [ fig : bowtieratioper ] ) .",
    "the elevated temperatures in the wim are confirmed by the [ ] @xmath2/[]@xmath1 intensity ratios ( figure  [ fig : bluenii ] ) and recent observations of [ o  ii ] @xcite .",
    "the ionization state in diffuse ionized gas is generally lower than that in classical  regions .",
    "several new observations of [ ]  and  indicate that , in general , the fraction of o@xmath23/o and he@xmath22/he in the wim and in the large bubble structures is low compared to  regions , implying a lower ionization state due to a softer ionizing radiation field and probably a lower ionization parameter ( e.g. , figures  [ fig : bowtiediag ] and [ fig : nfildiag ] ) . the high ionization of sulfur ( i.e. , the low values of s@xmath164/s ) in the wim of the perseus arm ( figs .",
    "15 , 16 , 21b ) appears to be an exception to this trend .",
    "the data also suggest that the diffuse low density gas close to the galactic plane may be more highly ionized than gas at larger distances from the plane . in the inner galaxy , this trend appears to reverse @xcite .",
    "conditions within the wim vary significantly .",
    "the mean temperature and ionization state can change considerably from one sight line to the next and even along a single sight line .",
    "moreover , the mean properties of the wim change from one region of the galaxy to another ( e.g. , see fig .  [",
    "fig : alldiag]b ) . within the wim",
    ", values of t and s@xmath22/s extend to significantly higher values than are found within classical  regions or even the extended bubbles .",
    "high latitude filaments superposed on the faint wim have spectral characteristics similar to the wim .",
    "this suggest a close relationship between these high latitude structures and the more diffuse background .",
    "the perseus superbubble provides strong evidence that a luminous o star cluster near the midplane can produce wide - spread , nearly wim - like ionization conditions to distances of 1000 pc or more from the ionizing stars .",
    "this superbubble has spectral characteristics similar to those observed in portions of the diffuse wim ( figs .  [ fig : alldiag]b and d ) and quite different from the spectral characteristics of the bright  region that immediately surrounds its source of ionization , the cas ob6 star cluster and other classical  regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alldiag]a and d ; table  [ tab : hiimulti ] ) .",
    "the fact that the smaller , brighter , denser orion - eridanus bubble has low [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios , similar to those in classical  regions , implies that bubble size , gas density within the ionized shell , and/or the flux and spectrum of the radiation escaping o star clusters may be important in setting the conditions within the ionized gas .",
    "for example , the presence of an extra source of non - ionizing heat can raise the gas temperature in low density ( @xmath165 @xmath9 ) ionized gas @xcite , which could account for the elevated , more wim - like temperatures in the low density perseus superbubble , as well as the more general relationship between temperature and emission measure ( point 1 above ) .",
    "filamentary structures within the perseus superbubble have physical conditions that differ from conditions in the fainter , more diffuse parts of the bubble .",
    "this implies that these filaments are discrete entities , likely regions of higher density , and not just directions of increased pathlength through folds or edge projections of a shell or sheet .",
    "the slightly depressed [ ] /h@xmath0  and [ ] /h@xmath0  ratios in these filaments , compared to the fainter superbubble emission adjacent to them , suggest that they are in fact cooler than the gas along adjacent sightlines through the superbubble .",
    "+ in conclusion , we believe that high spectral resolution emission line observations at visible wavelengths open a new window on the study of interstellar matter and processes not available through other techniques at other wavelengths .",
    "in particular , the application of nebular line diagnostics to the study of the warm ionized component of the interstellar medium provides an opportunity to understand better , through both observations and modelling , the large - scale effects of hot stars on the ionization and morphology of the interstellar medium within the galaxy s disk and halo .",
