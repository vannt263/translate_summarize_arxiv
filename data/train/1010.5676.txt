    "blazars are the most violent class of active galactic nuclei , consisting of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl  lac objects ( named after their historical prototype , bl  lacertae ) .",
    "they exhibit rapid variability down to time scales as short as a few minutes @xcite .",
    "their observed flux is dominated by a non - thermal continuum exhibiting two broad spectral bumps : a low - frequency bump from radio to uv  x - ray frequencies , and a high - frequency component from x - ray to @xmath8-rays . in the framework of relativistic jet models , the low - frequency ( radio  optical / uv ) emission from blazars",
    "is interpreted as synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons in a relativistic jet . the high - frequency ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath8-ray ) emission could either be produced via compton upscattering of low frequency radiation by the same electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission ( leptonic jet models ; for a recent review see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", about 30 blazars have been detected in very high energy ( vhe , @xmath9  gev ) @xmath8-rays with ground - based air erenkov telescope facilities - ray sources see http://tevcat.uchicago.edu ] .",
    "most of these tev blazars belong to the sub - class of high - frequency peaked bl  lac objects ( hbls ) .",
    "they are characterized by a synchrotron spectrum peaking at frequencies @xmath10  hz , i.e. , in the uv or x - ray range , and @xmath8-ray peaks at @xmath11  hz , i.e. , typically beyond the fermi energy range @xcite .",
    "vhe @xmath8-rays from sources at cosmological distances can be absorbed by the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) due to @xmath12 pair production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , the ebl absorption of distant vhe @xmath8-ray sources may provide a probe of the spectrum and cosmological evolution of the ebl , which is notoriously difficult to measure directly due to bright foregrounds .    the bl  lac object 1es  1011 + 496 was detected as a vhe @xmath8-ray emitter by magic in the spring of 2007 @xcite .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy at the mmt confirmed the previously uncertain redshift of @xmath13 for this source @xcite . at the time of its vhe detection ,",
    "1es  1011 + 496 was the most distant vhe @xmath8-ray source known with a well - determined redshift , and to date it still ranks among the top five .",
    "it might therefore offer a prime opportunity for studying the ebl through its absorption signature at vhe @xmath8-rays .",
    "however , in order to exploit this opportunity , a thorough understanding of the intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source , constrained through observations at lower ( radio through gev @xmath8-ray ) frequencies , is essential . for this purpose , we present here a detailed study of the optical spectral variability of this object with data gathered over the course of 5 years at the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory on kitt peak , arizona .    the vhe @xmath8-ray detection of 1es  1011 + 496 was triggered by a large optical outburst of the source in 2007 march @xcite .",
    "this object is regularly monitored in the optical r - band through the turku blazar monitoring program led by kari nilsson , with the 1.03  m telescope of the tuorla observatory in finland , as well as the 35  cm telescope of the kva observatory on la palma , canary islands , spain .",
    "apart from this , 1es  1011 + 496 has so far received rather little attention by optical observers , and its optical spectral variability has remained unexplored . the object has been observed in x - rays by einstein @xcite and more recently , swift / xrt @xcite . in all observations , it shows a steep x - ray spectrum , indicating the dominance of synchrotron emission in the x - ray regime .",
    "1es  1011 + 496 may also be associated with the egret @xmath8-ray source 3eg  j1009 + 4855 @xcite , although this association is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the object is clearly detected by fermi and listed in the fermi 3-month catalogue as the source 0fgl  j1015.2 + 4927 .",
    "the fermi data reveal a rising @xmath5 spectrum ( i.e. , photon index @xmath14 ) in the 100  mev  30  gev energy range @xcite .",
    "optical / uv observations were performed by swift / uvot in may 2008 @xcite , during the rising phase of an optical outburst similar to the one triggering the magic discovery observations in 2007 . during those observations ,",
    "swift / uvot measured a rising @xmath5 optical / uv continuum spectrum .",
    "this , together with the hard fermi spectrum , justified the classification of 1es  1011 + 496 as an hbl .",
    "over the course of @xmath15  years , we have collected optical multi - band ( ubvri ) photometric data on 1es  1011 + 496 . as there are no comparison stars with reliably calibrated ubvri magnitudes in the field of view of this object , we calibrated the magnitudes for 5 comparison stars . in  [ observations ]",

    "the telescope is equipped with standard johnson - cousins ubvri filters .",
    "exposure times for science frames on 1es  1011 + 496 were between 60  180  s , depending on filter and atmospheric conditions .",

    "[ findingchart ] .",
    "for the calibration , we obtained a total of 30 ( 2 per filter per standard ) exposures of the landoldt equatorial standards @xcite pg  1525 - 071 , pg  1633 + 099 , pg  1657 + 078 on the night of april 28 , 2005 , which provided photometric observing conditions .",
    "instrumental magnitudes of these three equatorial standards as well as our comparison stars in the field of 1es  1011 + 496 were extracted using the _ phot _ routine within the iraf package daophot . following standard procedures for iraf photometric calibrations @xcite",

    "after calibration of our comparison stars , we extracted instrumental magnitudes of the comparison stars and 1es  1011 + 496 using the _ phot _ routine within the daophot package of iraf , and converted instrumental to physical magnitudes assuming that the difference between instrumental and physical magnitudes is the same for the object and all comparison stars .",
    "the resulting light curves for all observing runs combined are displayed in fig .",
    "[ lightcurves ] .",
    "the figure illustrates that for most of our runs , the object was in a rather faint optical state with @xmath0 , and shows very moderate variability .",
    "however , we did observe substantial variability during our two observing runs in 2008 april 9  14 and may 10  13 .",
    "this was during the rising phase of a major outburst that peaked later that year .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge , there are no observations available covering the peak of that outburst . during our observations we found a maximum r - band brightness of @xmath42 .",

    "the variability in all optical bands appears well correlated .",
    "this correlation will be investigated in more detail in  [ crosscorrelations ] .",
    "in order to test whether the variability discussed in the previous section is associated with spectral changes , we first calculated b - r color indices for any pair of b and r magnitudes measured within 15 minutes of each other . the resulting color - magnitude diagram ( r magnitude vs. b - r color )",
    "is shown in figure [ color ] .",

    "a fit of a linear correlation results in a marginally acceptable @xmath46 .",
    "a correlation analysis of the color - magnitude data set yields a pearson s correlation coefficient of @xmath1 , which is generally interpreted as a weak positive correlation between color and magnitude . in order to quantify the probability of such a correlation coefficient resulting from an uncorrelated data set",
    ", we performed monte - carlo simulations of 1 billion randomly produced , uncorrelated data sets , extending over similar spreads of values , and with the same number of data points as our observational data set .",
    "the pearson s correlation coefficient for each set was evaluated , and from the entire ensemble , the probability of a correlation coefficient @xmath47 for values of @xmath48 resulting from an uncorrelated data set was evaluated . from these simulations , we find that the probability of a correlation coefficient of @xmath1 in a data set with the characteristics of our r vs. b - r data is @xmath49 , indicating , in fact , a highly significant correlation .",
    "the observed correlation corresponds to a bluer - when - brighter trend , as observed in most bl  lac objects .",
    "this is likely to reflect the dynamics of the non - thermal synchrotron emission from the jet dominating in the optical regime .    in order to investigate spectral changes in the optical continuum in more detail ,",
    "we extracted ubvri seds for all sequences of magnitudes measured within 15 minutes of each other . for this purpose , the magnitudes were de - reddened using the galactic extinction coefficients as given in the nasa extragalactic database and converted to @xmath5 fluxes . a representative sample of the resulting seds is plotted in figure [ seds ] .",
    "the seds all exhibit a @xmath5 peak in the optical regime , typically between the v and b bands .",
    "they suggest a positive trend of increasing @xmath5 peak flux with increasing peak frequency , in accordance with the weak b - r vs. r correlation found above .",
    "we tested this hypothesis further by fitting all optical seds with a simple parabolic shape to determine the peak frequency , @xmath50 , and the peak flux , @xmath51 .",
    "the best fit values for our entire data set are plotted in fig .",
    "[ nupeak ] .",
    "the @xmath5 peak flux and peak frequencies are clearly correlated , with pearson s @xmath3 , with a probability for non - correlation of @xmath4 .",
    "the best linear regression fit to the logarithms of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 values yields a power - law correlation @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "a possible interpretation of this synchrotron peak shift will be discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "a visual inspection of figure [ nupeak ] seems to suggest a steepening of the peak flux vs. peak frequency dependence towards high peak frequencies ( and peak fluxes ) .",
    "however , when restricting the regression to high frequencies ( e.g. , @xmath55  hz ) , the correlation between peak flux and peak frequency vanishes , therefore not allowing for a quantification of a possible change of the correlation slope towards high frequencies .",
    "a visual inspection of the light curves in fig . [ lightcurves ] and [ lc2008 ] suggests that the variability in all wavebands is closely correlated . in order to corroborate this finding",
    ", we performed a discrete correlation function ( dcf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) analysis among all our light curves .",
    "figure [ dcfbr ] shows a typical example of the resulting dcf between the b and r band light curves .",
    "the dcfs between the light curves of all bands peak at values near 1 , indicating a close correlation between all optical bands .",
    "this is expected if the optical continuum is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron emission of the same relativistic electron population .",
    "time lags between different frequency bands could potentially serve as a diagnostic of the magnetic field strength in the emitting region ( modulo the doppler factor , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore fitted the dcfs with an asymmetric gaussian to determine possible inter - band delays through the fitted peak of the dcf .",
    "however , any lags indicated by our dcfs are all either consistent with @xmath56 or at the @xmath16  2  @xmath57 level .",
    "furthermore , our sequential data - taking process introduces an artificial `` lag '' of up to @xmath58  min , and none of the lags found through the dcf analysis are larger than that .",
    "therefore , we conclude that we did not detect any inter - band time lags .",
    "we have presented an analysis of data from 5 years of observations of the bl lac object 1es  1011 + 496 at the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope of the mdm observatory .",
    "we found moderate variability on a time scale of several days throughout most of our observations .",
    "the variability at all ( ubvri ) optical bands is well correlated with no detectable time lags between them .",
    "the snap - shot seds during our observations showed a synchrotron peak within the optical range , typically between the v and b bands .",
    "the b - r color is correlated ( @xmath1 ; @xmath59 ) with the r - band magnitude , indicating a bluer - when - brighter trend .",
    "such a trend is observed in many bl lac objects , where the optical emission is strongly dominated by synchrotron emission from the jet .",
    "we note that the opposite behaviour has been found in several quasar - type blazars , where a slowly variable big blue bump , signaling a contribution due to a luminous accretion disk , dilutes the continuum variability at the blue end of the optical spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is a range of possible causes for the optical ( and multi - wavelength ) variability of blazar emission .",
    "these include changes in the doppler factor ( e.g. , caused by a bending jet ) , injection of a new relativistic particle population into the jet ( plausibly caused by a shock ) , a changing acceleration efficiency ( changing characteristic lorentz factors of the radiating electrons and possibly a change of the spectral index of the non - thermal electron distribution ) , and/or a change of the magnetic field . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "several of these effects might be at work at the same time to produce the observed blazar variability .",
    "however , one can make simple predictions concerning the shift ( in frequency and @xmath5 peak flux ) of the synchrotron peak for at least three cases : a changing doppler factor , a changing magnetic field , and a change of the characteristic ( peak ) electron lorentz factor ( leaving all other parameters of the emission region unchanged ) .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron spectrum is related to a peak in the electron spectrum at a characteristic lorentz factor @xmath62 , the magnetic field @xmath63 and the doppler factor @xmath64 \\right)^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath65 is the bulk lorentz factor of the emission region and @xmath66 is the angle between the line of sight towards earth and the direction of motion ( the jet axis ) , through          from equations [ nupk ] and [ nufnupk ] , we see that if the variability is dominated by a changing doppler factor , one would expect a synchrotron peak shift as @xmath69 .",
    "a change solely in the characteristic electron lorentz factor , @xmath62 , would result in a synchrotron peak shift as @xmath70 , while a change in only the magnetic field yields the behaviour @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the synchrotron peak shift found in our data set is consistent with the variability being dominated by a changing magnetic field .",
    "however , as pointed out above , we need to caution that such a change in the magnetic field might realistically also impact the shape of the electron distribution , primarily through a changing synchrotron cooling time scale .",
    "clearly , more sophisticated analyses of this synchrotron peak shift are needed , but are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that the shape of the optical seds found in all of our observations contradicts the optical - uv spectrum observed by swift / uvot on 2008 may 2 and 8 , which indicates a rising slope throughout the optical regime @xcite .",
    "however , most of our observations were taken during moderately faint states of the source , while the swift / uvot spectrum corresponds to a bright state , similar to the major optical flare that triggered the magic detection in 2007 .",
    "given the trend of the synchrotron peak shift which we found in our data , it is conceivable that the swift / uvot observations correspond to an extreme case of a high synchrotron peak frequency , in accord with a very high optical flux .",
