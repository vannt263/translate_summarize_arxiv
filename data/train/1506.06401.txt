    "eddy currents are induced electric currents in a conducting material that result when either the object moves through a nonuniform magnetic field or is stationary but subject to a time - changing magnetic field .",
    "they were first observed by franois arago@xcite but it was not until michael faraday s discovery of induction@xcite that the mechanism of this phenomenon was understood .",
    "a pioneering experiment to quantify the heat dissipated by the eddy currents , and hence connect electromagnetism to thermodynamics , is von waltenhofen s pendulum@xcite [ figure [ fig : schematic](a)(c ) ] .",
    "the bob of the pendulum is a non ferromagnetic conducting plate which swings between the poles of an electromagnet , generating circulating eddy currents .",
    "the dissipative eddy currents tend to oppose the motion of the bob , and hence damp the pendulum .",
    "the experiment is an example of magnetic braking : when the magnet is turned off , the pendulum oscillates as a classic pendulum , damped only by air resistance and frictional forces in the hinge ; when the magnetic field is switched on , the pendulum comes to a rapid stop .",
    "von waltenhofen s pendulum is a popular demonstration in high school@xcite and introductory undergraduate@xcite classes because it provides a striking visual illustration of the invisible eddy currents .",
    "it is easy to set up , and gives the instructor a chance to discuss real - world applications such as magnetic braking in roller coasters , hybrid cars and the detection of flaws in conductive materials .",
    "moreover , by using different shaped plates as bobs , some of the characteristics of eddy currents can be explored : if the plate is now substituted with one where the slits do not reach the edges [ figure 1(d)(ii ) ] , the damping is only mildly altered .",
    "if a solid plate is replaced by a comb - like plate with slits cut into it [ figure 1(d)(iii)-(iv ) ] the damping effect is greatly attenuated .",
    "students infer from this that the eddy currents must be localized to some region of the plate .",
    "typically , however , the relationship between the shape of the plate and the damping is considered only qualitatively due to the complexity of the calculations required , which require advanced mathematical techniques introduced in higher - level electromagnetism classes . in this paper , therefore , we apply some of these strategies to predict the damping behavior of conducting plates with different geometries .",
    "we investigate four plate shapes , illustrated in figure 1(d ) : ( i ) a square plate , ( ii ) a plate with holes that do not reach the edge , ( iii ) a plate with with two slots , ( iv ) another with four slots . the present work was primarily performed during a project - based graduate electrodynamics class with the objective of giving students a real , tractable example of the utility of their calculations .",
    "it was also an opportunity to address the challenges of connecting theory to experiment , even where the fundamental theory is uncontroversial .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the form of the damping for the present experiment is derived first in terms of a simplified model suitable for undergraduate classes and the effect of these damping terms on the simple pendulum is explored . in section iii , we present a more sophisticated model derived from maxwell s equations in the magneto - quasistatic approximation . within this framework , the rate of power dissipation for each plate is estimated using a conformal mapping technique and a finite element solution . in section iv ,",
    "the motion of the pendulum with each of the four plates is determined experimentally and compared with the predictions of each of the theoretical models in section v. in section vi , the pedagogical context of this work is discussed .",

    "( [ eq : equationofmotion ] ) ; for the magneto - quasistatic model the stokes drag is supplemented by the position - dependent dissipation rate , @xmath138    as is well - known , the equation of motion ( [ eq : generalequationofmotion ] ) with constant @xmath139 can be solved analytically yielding , @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are amplitude and offset parameters , @xmath56 is a phase and @xmath143 .",
    "hence , the motion remains oscillatory for @xmath144 . if the plate is centered with respect to the pole pieces , @xmath145 ; @xmath146 and @xmath56 similarly represent initial conditions that are experimentally controllable . rather than fit to the entire trajectory , it is convenient to look only at the extreme points where the pendulum is stationary and @xmath147 . inserting this into ( [ eq : solutionlinear ] ) and rearranging , we obtain @xmath148 showing that the values of the position of the pendulum at successive stationary points should obey a linear relation on a plot of @xmath149 versus @xmath150 .    for the magneto - quasistatic model , analytical solution of ( [ eq : generalequationofmotion ] ) is impossible and hence the equation must be solved numerically .",
    "this was performed in _",
    "mathematica_. because the strategy of looking at successive extrema on log scales remains a valuable fitting strategy even if the equation of motion is solved numerically , we additionally incorporated an extremum - finding routine to identify the stationary points from the calculated trajectory . with these simplified analytical and numerical magneto - quasistatic models ,",
    "we are now ready to compare them with experimental data .",

    ", width=316 ]    in order to test the predictions of the calculations performed in previous sections , we performed an experiment to observe the motion of a pendulum with the different paddles attached and fit the models described in previous sections to the trajectories obtained .",
    "the magnetic brake apparatus used , shown in figure [ fig : app ] , was designed as a classroom demonstration for introductory physics classes .",
    "the apparatus consists of an electromagnet with flat pole pieces of adjustable separation , powered by a 12v car battery . a potential divider and ammeter",
    "were incorporated into the circuit so that the current through the magnet could be changed and measured .",
    "the pole pieces are @xmath151 cm and for the present experiment were separated by @xmath152 cm .",
    "the pendulum hangs from a supporting frame above the pole pieces and is made from a solid rod of length 39.5 cm to which different paddles of interest can be affixed with screws .",
    "four plates were studied , each of side 11.43 cm by 11.43 cm with different arrangements of holes or slits as shown earlier in figure [ fig : schematic](d ) .",
    "students collected videos of the motion of the pendulum using a cellphone camera , and in a later iteration a digital camera was used to achieve higher image quality and frame rate .",
    "although data logging hardware could also be used where available , the video approach was adopted as it is inexpensive , required no additional apparatus beyond the existing demonstration and is easily reproduced by others .",
    "a white piece of paper with a scale bar was attached to the pole piece behind the camera to provide a uniform background and facilitate quantitative analysis of the resulting videos .",
    "the camera was positioned so that the lens was aligned with the rod at rest ; its position was marked with chalk so that it could be easily replaced after each trial .",
    "the plates were released from the same point outside of the magnet , determined by a ruler placed on top of the pole pieces .",
    "the plates were released when the camera started recording and data was collected until the pendulum came to a rest .",
    "two sample frames from one of the movies are shown in figure [ fig : reslice](a ) .",
    "for each plate , 5 videos were collected with @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 current flowing through the circuit respectively .",
    "selected videos were taken more than once to verify repeatability .",
    "these values obviously depend on the details of the circuit , but were chosen as follows : for the lower bound , a value was sought such that there was a visible difference between the motion of the plate with weakest damping ( the one with 4 slits ) in the on and off states . for the upper bound , we found a current level such that the plate with the strongest damping gave 2 - 3 oscillations before coming to a stop , i.e. we are in the oscillatory regime of @xmath144 in equation ( [ eq : generalequationofmotion ] ) .",
    "( a ) sample frames from a video of the pendulum s motion . from this movie ,",
    "the row of pixels indicated with the dashed line is taken from each frame and composited to produce the resliced image ( b ) . ]    having collected the dataset of videos of the pendulum with different plates , the trajectories were extracted from the videos .",
    "this was done in two steps : first , the open - source image processing program ` imagej ` @xcite was used to `` reslice '' the movie , converting it from a stack of images of the @xmath158 plane at different time points @xmath150 to a new stack of images of @xmath159 at different vertical positions @xmath160 . an sample output",

    "[ fig : reslice](a ) .",
    "the second step in the data extraction was performed by a custom program written in _",
    ", included as supplementary material .",
    "this first subtracted the background , then for each time point located the position of the bob by finding the centroid of the pixels with intensity above a certain value .",
    "the result of this process was to yield for each movie a list of @xmath159 representing the trajectory of the pendulum . using the rulers and",
    "known frame rate of the camera ( 30fps ) , the list was calibrated to physical coordinates ; the program also subtracts the equilibrium position of the pendulum from the @xmath21 position . to facilitate comparison with the models ,",
    "the extremum - finding routine mentioned in the previous section was used to identify a list of stationary points @xmath161 from each trajectory .",
    "a constant was subtracted from the times such that for each trajectory the first extremum was set to @xmath162 .",
    "having obtained a set of experimental trajectories , we now fit both models to the data . beginning with the simplified wire model , the analytical solution in section [ sub : effect - on - the ]",
    "implies that for each individual trajectory the extrema should follow a straight line on semi - log scales with slope @xmath163 from the set of results displayed as points in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] , it is seen that this is generally the case , though some deviations are apparent . in particular , the motion starts to decay more rapidly once @xmath164 ; we therefore excluded this data from our fit . for each plate ,",
    "several values of current @xmath165 were used to take a succession of trajectories . although it is obvious that @xmath166 , we did not explicitly measure the magnetic field and therefore absorb this unknown constant of proportionality together with @xmath7 the effective resistivity of the wire into a single fitting parameter @xmath167 .",
    "this fitting parameter could , of course , in principle be calculated or measured separately , but the purpose of fitting here is to establish whether the model is consistent with the results for all plates simultaneously .",
    "the slopes extracted from the ensemble of plates with different @xmath168 ( calculated values are shown in table [ tab : fitsimplified ] ) at different applied currents @xmath165 should therefore universally be described by , @xmath169 estimates for the initial position of each trajectory @xmath141 were obtained by fitting a straight line to the extrema individually on semi - log scales .",
    "we then estimated @xmath170 for each plate from the @xmath171 trajectory for each plate ; the results are shown in table [ tab : fitsimplified ] .",
    "two pairs of plates seem to cluster around similar values ; these were collected at different times indicating that the natural damping of the apparatus , perhaps lubricant in the hinge , changed between them .",
    ".[tab : fitsimplified]geometric parameters and fitted @xmath167 , @xmath170 for each plate using the simplified model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     results from the universal least - squares one - parameter fit for @xmath167 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fit](a ) . as can be seen ,",
    "the fit is nt bad and follows many of the trajectories quite well .",
    "that said , there are many discrepancies .",
    "we therefore estimated @xmath167 from each individual plate using the data at different applied field . while the details of these are not shown here , the quality of fit was very much better .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath167 are displayed in table [ tab : fitsimplified ] .",
    "in particular , it is not surprising that the plate with 4 holes is such an outlier as the wire model can not account for this geometry .",
    "values for the other plates are the same order of magnitude , which together with fig .",
    "[ fig : fit](a ) demonstrates that the simplified model gives reasonable estimates for the influence of plate geometry even though it is based on quite egregious approximations .    in the same spirit",
    ", we assume that the damping term in ( [ eq : generalequationofmotion ] ) for the magneto - quasistatic model can similarly be described by a universal constant @xmath167 , @xmath172 for this model , as well as @xmath141 , @xmath170 , @xmath167 , @xmath173 and @xmath165 , it is also necessary to specify the natural angular frequency @xmath174 ; the value from the @xmath171 trajectory for each plate is used since @xmath175 for the weak damping in the absence of the magnetic field and hence @xmath176 . the results of the one - parameter universal fit for @xmath167 are displayed in [ fig : fit](b ) . the quality of fit is significantly better , especially for large amplitudes and early times , and more consistent between plates than for the simple model , implying that the magneto - quasistatic model yields good predictions of the effect of plate geometry .",
    "of particular importance is the fact that the fit for the 4 hole plate is no worse than that of the other plates , suggesting that these features have been handled correctly by the model .",
    "nonetheless , there remains an unexplained phenomenon in the data , i.e the anomalous increase in damping once the amplitude of the motion drops below @xmath177 .",
    "this is not predicted by either model .",
    "the simplified model predicts a constant rate of damping , while the magneto - quasistatic model predicts a crossover from magnetically dominated damping at large amplitudes to stokes dominated damping at small amplitudes .",
    "we tried adjusting the magneto - quasistatic model in various waysoffsetting the position of the plate with respect to the pole pieces and changing the size of the plate relative to the pole piecesbut found no similar effect for any reasonable parameters for the experiment .",
    "clearly , the stokes form of the non - magnetic damping is most likely at fault , because the source of damping is likely to be primarily the hinge rather than air resistance ; further analysis should be performed to determine the origin of this anomaly .",
    "the scientific results presented in this paper were obtained in part by students in spring 2013 as part of the electromagnetic theory ii class at tufts university , the second course in the e&m sequence in the graduate program at tufts ; two students from the class are co - authors on the paper ( cw and jw ) having spent a considerable time subsequently acquiring additional data and performing calculations . in this section , the pedagogical context of these activities is briefly documented in the hope that it is of use to others .",
    "the idea of incorporating ( simple ) experiments in class was motivated by an observation that key scientific skills expected of graduate studentsconnecting theory and experiment ; article reading ; journal selection and article preparationare not included explicitly in the curriculum .",
    "the project was spread over the second half of the semester as follows :    1 .   a prepatory homework where students derived the magneto - quasistatic model [ sec : magneto - quasistatic - model ] .",
    "two @xmath178 hour class periods where students worked in groups .",
    "the students were divided into groups of four and worked on : i ) conformal mapping analysis , ii ) finite element analysis and iii ) experiments .",
    "the instructor provided scaffolding activities to help students learn flexpde and the schwarz - christoffel mapping technique .",
    "these activities continued subsequently outside of class .",
    "3 .   a reading activity whereby students had to identify possible journals for publication of this work ;",
    "this was followed by a 15 minute discussion of journal selection in class .",
    "4 .   a just - in - time teaching@xcite - like pre - class activity in which students had to identify the structural elements in a typical paper and construct an outline ;",
    "these were passed round anonymously for peer feedback .",
    "a homework activity in which students prepared an introduction for the paper .",
    "students were asked to read each other s work and identify strong features as well as possible modifications as a pre - class activity .",
    "this was followed by a discussion in class .",
    "each group collaboratively produced a draft section for the final paper as part of a homework ; these were combined by tja into a coherent document and extensively rewritten during the second iteration of experiments .",
    "the focus of the class and restricted time available necessitated some design trade - offs .",
    "for example , we chose to use an existing commercial software package , ` flexpde ` , as opposed to implementing a custom finite element program , for several reasons : first , the scale and complexity of problems solvable with a specialist code is much greater than with a simple custom - written program and hence should be applicable to situations encountered in student s research projects .",
    "second , the program contains advanced features such as adaptive refinementallocation of grid points based on estimated errorthat are time - consuming to implement .",
    "third , by removing the focus of the exercise from programmatic implementation , time can be spent on understanding how to properly interpret the output using fundamental principles of numerical analysis such as order , error estimation and convergence .",
    "while the project - based approach is well - grounded in a theory of learning ( constructivism ) , due to the small @xmath179 size of the class , it is difficult to rigorously demonstrate the effectiveness of the activity .",
    "future iterations would strongly benefit from pre and post testing .",
    "even so , the outcomes of the project indicate that students made considerable progress towards learning these challenging scientific skills . moreover , the class was very highly rated in the formal feedback mechanism .",
    "it is hoped that , in future , physics education researchers might attempt a thorough analysis of this and related approaches at the graduate level .",
    "the present work has provided a careful , quantitative analysis of a familiar classroom demonstration , the van waltenhofen pendulum .",
    "a magneto - quasistatic model has been shown to successfully predict the relative damping of a selection of plates with different geometry using conformal mapping and finite elements as tools to carry out the necessary calculations . as a by - product , a number of valuable resources for more general use , including plots of the current distribution during the course of the motion of the pendulum , have been produced .",
    "additionally , a greatly simplified model , suitable for use in introductory physics classes , has been formulated that could be used to make the classroom demonstration more quantitative .",
