    "transition metal oxides with geometry frustration have attracted considerable interest over decades .",
    "@xcite they commonly exhibit the persistence of strong spin fluctuations at low temperatures . as a result ,",
    "the long - range magnetic order is at least partially suppressed and various short range correlated phases such as spin liquid , spin glass or spin ice develop . in some cases ,",
    "frustration can be partially or entirely released , either by structural distortions that lift the ground - state degeneracy , or by the `` order - by - disorder '' mechanism , @xcite resulting in the establishment of a long - range magnetic order .",
    "two well - known structural topology causing the presence of geometry frustration are two - dimensional triangular lattice and two - dimensional kagome lattice . compositions whose structural motif embraces triangular or kagome layers are of great interest as model systems and have been the focus of numerous studies . in this respect ,",
    "the recently discovered `` 114 '' cobaltite cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite is particularly interesting because its crystal structure is built up of an alternate stacking of triangular or kagome layers formed by the coo@xmath0 tetrahedra ( shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : xrd ] ) .",
    "there is very large distortion in the crystal , characterized by a strong buckling of the kagome layers .",
    "@xcite in addition , it exhibits charge ordering , with co@xmath5 sitting on two sites and `` mixed valent '' cobalt co@xmath6/co@xmath7 sitting on two other sites .",
    "@xcite due to the large structural distortion and the charge ordering , the geometry frustration is lifted , resulting in a ferrimagnetic ground state at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite    although significant progress has been made in understanding the magnetic properties in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 , a few questions remain to be answered .",
    "for example , does the system shows short - range magnetic correlations above @xmath3 like their `` 114 '' cousins such as ybaco@xmath0o@xmath1 ? @xcite why the obtained effective moment differs significantly from the expected value in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 ?",
    "@xcite what s the nature of the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition ?    to address these questions , we systematically measured the magnetic properties of cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it is found that the susceptibility exhibits an downward deviation below @xmath2 360 k , suggesting the occurrence of short range magnetic correlations at temperature well above @xmath3 . by extending the magnetization measurement up to 800 k , the effective moment",
    "is determined to be 4.5 @xmath4/f.u through a curie - weiss analysis , which is consistent with that expected for the co@xmath5/co@xmath6 high spin species . using a criterion given by banerjee , @xcite",
    "we demonstrate that the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic phase transition in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 is a first order one .",
    "polycrystalline sample of cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 was prepared by using the conventional solid - state reaction method described in ref .",
    "stoichiometric proportions of high purity caco@xmath8 , baco@xmath8 and co@xmath8o@xmath0 were mixed and heated at 900 @xmath9 in air to decarbonation .",
    "they are then pelletized , and then sintered at 1100 @xmath9 in air for 12 hours and quenched to room temperature .",
    "the structure and the phase purity of the samples were checked by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) at room temperature .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed with a commercial superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( quantum design mpms 7t - xl ) and a physical property measurement system ( quantum design ppms-16 t ) equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .",
    "figure [ fig : xrd ] displays the powder xrd pattern of cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 at room temperature .",
    "rietveld refinement @xcite of the xrd pattern confirms that the sample is single phase with an orthorhombic structure ( @xmath10 space group ) .",
    "the lattice parameters are determined to be @xmath11 6.2871 @xmath12 , @xmath13 11.0106 @xmath12 and @xmath14 10.1945 @xmath12 , which agree well with previous reports within the experimental error .",
    "@xcite    the temperature dependence of the magnetization @xmath15(@xmath16 ) between 2 k and 400 k under 0.1 t is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] .",
    "they are measured during field cooling sequence ( fcc ) , during warming after field cooling sequence ( fcw ) and during warming after zero field cooling sequence ( zfc ) , respectively .",
    "all curve shows a rapid increase below @xmath2 70 k , suggesting the occurrence of the transition into a magnetically ordered state . at 5",
    "k , the saturated magnetic moment is still relatively small , only @xmath2 1.1 @xmath17 under 14 t ( see the lower panel of fig . [ fig : m ] ) , agreeing with a ferrimagnetic ground state .",
    "the curie temperature , defined as the temperature corresponding to the maximum in the @xmath18 curve , is determined to be 60 k ( see the inset to fig . [",
    "fig : m ] ) . below @xmath3 ,",
    "we observe significant irreversibility between the magnetization curve measured after zfc and fcc histories .",
    "this is attributed to the large coercive field compared to the applied field .",
    "@xcite as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m ] , the coercive field of cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 is about 2 t at 5 k , which is much larger than the applied field of 0.1 t. therefore , the magnetic domains will be locked in random direction during zfc sequence while be aligned to the same direction during fcc or fcw sequences , resulting in the large irreversibility below @xmath3 .",
    "all these results are consistent with previous report , @xcite confirming that our sample is of high quality",
    ".    a close look on the temperature dependence of the magnetization reveals more information .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] displays the enlarged view of the @xmath19 curves between @xmath3 and 400 k. one can see that while the magnetization decreases with increasing temperature above @xmath3 the slope of the @xmath19 curve does not decrease monotonously as that expected for a pure paramagnetic state where the curie - weiss law predicts @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 is the curie constant and @xmath22 is the curie - weiss temperature ) . in order to understand this behavior ,",
    "we extend the measurement of the @xmath15(@xmath16 ) during fcc sequence up to 800 k and perform the curie - weiss analysis . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cw ] , 1/@xmath23 shows an upward deviation from the linearity below @xmath2 360 k. since the deviation temperature is much higher than the curie temperature , this behavior could not be attributed to the critical enhancement of the spin fluctuations due to the approach to the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition but suggests the occurrence of short range magnetic correlations .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature @xmath22 is determined to be @xmath2 -890",
    "k. this gives @xmath24 which means cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 is strongly frustrated .",
    "the effective moment is determined to be @xmath2 4.5 @xmath17 , which agrees well with the value of a 1:1 combination of co@xmath5/co@xmath6 high spin species expected based on the chemical formula .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature and the effective moment obtained here are different from previous report .",
    "@xcite this should be understood because short - range magnetic correlations might appears in their fitting temperature region .    in order to obtain further information on the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", we use the criteria proposed by banerjee to determine the order of this transition . by considering the essential similarity between the landau - lifshitz @xcite and bean - rodbell @xcite criteria",
    ", banerjee shows that the slope of the @xmath25 versus @xmath26 curves near the critical temperature can distinguish the first - order magnetic transition from the second order ones : a negative slope means the former and a positive slope means the latter .",
    "@xcite we then measured the initial isothermal magnetization curves at temperatures in the vicinity of the curie temperature . before each run , the sample is warmed up to 200 k and then cooled to the measuring temperature under zero field to ensure a perfect demagnetization of the sample .",
    "the data are summarized in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath27 curve exhibits a peculiar behavior that its slope shows a decrease before an increase at intermediate fields .",
    "this behavior was also observed in mnas , where a first order transition occurs at its curie temperature and is used to test banerjee s criteria .",
    "@xcite we replotted the @xmath27 curves as @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mh ] .",
    "negative slope is clearly observed between 64 and 70 k , which confirms that the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition occurred in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 has a first order character according to the criterion .",
    "in conclusion , we systematically investigate the magnetic properties of cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the curie - weiss temperature is determined to be @xmath2 -890 k and the effective moment be @xmath2 4.5 @xmath17 .",
    "the susceptibility shows downward deviation from the curie - weiss law below @xmath2 360 k , hinting that short range magnetic correlations might occur at temperature much higher than @xmath3 = 60 k. the paramagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition in cabaco@xmath0o@xmath1 is found to have the first order character .",
