    "accretion on to a black hole is the most efficient way of extracting energy from normal matter , and so must power the most luminous phenomena in the universe . to drive quasars and other bright agn without exceeding the eddington limit",
    "requires supermassive black hole ( smbh ) accretors , ranging up to several @xmath3 , and accretion rates of up to @xmath4 .",
    "these statements probably encapsulate all that is securely known about accretion in agn .",
    "the @xmath2 relation ( see below ) strongly suggests a connection between smbh and galaxy growth .",
    "this in turn points to galaxy mergers as the common motor of both phenomena .",
    "cosmological simulations ( e.g. di matteo et al . , 2005 )",
    "aim to show the plausibility of this idea , by demonstrating how a series of mergers can produce smbh and galaxies satisfying the @xmath5 relation at low redshift . to make the calculations tractable",
    "requires a sub  resolution recipe for accretion , and this is usually taken as the bondi rate @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the bondi radius , with @xmath8 the local sound speed , @xmath9 the gas density and @xmath10 the smbh mass .",
    "however there are several problems with this recipe .",
    "first , it is self  consistent only if @xmath10 is a good approximation to the total gravitating mass inside @xmath11 .",
    "this requires @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gas fraction relative to dark matter , and @xmath14 is the velocity dispersion in the galaxy bulge .",
    "this is far smaller than the spatial resolution available in typical cosmological simulations .",
    "if the resolution scale is @xmath15 , the recipe gives @xmath16 .",
    "this often leads to estimated accretion rates far above the eddington rate @xmath17 , which have to be corrected by assuming that the rate never goes above this value .",
    "although this may be roughly correct for bright quasars ( see below ) , it is obvious that this arbitrary procedure must give an entirely misleading impression of the duty cycle of accretion .",
    "in fact it is unlikely that any agn accretes at very super  eddington rates . for the maximum possible accretion rate is the dynamical value @xmath18 which describes the case where gas is initially in rough virial equilibrium in the bulge of a galaxy with velocity dispersion @xmath14 and baryonic mass fraction @xmath19 .",
    "parametrizing , we find @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and we have taken @xmath22 . for a black hole mass close to the observed @xmath23 relation",
    "this implies an eddington ratio @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "since @xmath26 for the black holes in agn , and @xmath27 is an upper limit to @xmath28 , modest values @xmath29 of the eddington ratio are likely .",
    "indeed , in the case where the smbh does not dominate the mass inside the estimated bondi radius , a realistic estimate of the bondi rate is actually close to the dynamical value , since @xmath30 where @xmath31 . now using ( [ rbondi ] ) with @xmath32 in place of @xmath10",
    "we see that @xmath33 and in a realistic situation we would expect @xmath34 .",
    "even if one were able to resolve the bondi radius and estimate the rate @xmath35 cleanly , it is still unlikely that this gives an estimate of the true accretion rate at the black hole and thus the agn luminosity .",
    "the reason is that in any conceivable physical situation the gas must have sufficient angular momentum to orbit the black hole , and so must form an accretion disc .",
    "thus the term ` bondi accretion ' is better rendered as ` bondi capture ' .",
    "gas inside the bondi radius can not easily escape the black hole s vicinity , but is not required to accrete on to it at the bondi rate .",
    "the fact that accretion must ultimately proceed via a disc now leads to another set of difficulties .",
    "if , as is likely in many cases , the disc cools efficiently , it will become thin and keplerian . in this case",
    "we can compute its viscous timescale @xmath36 at disc radius @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the viscosity parameter @xmath39 in units of its likely value 0.1 ( king et al . , 2007 ) , @xmath40 is the disc scaleheight , and @xmath41 .",
    "so unless the disc is very small , its viscous time is too long for significant accretion on to the smbh .",
    "if the disc is large , on the other hand , it is likely to become self  gravitating and fragment into stars , since its mass @xmath42 exceeds the self ",
    "gravity limit @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44    equation ( [ visc ] ) shows that gas orbiting at only a few parsecs takes more than a hubble time to accrete .",
    "so the gas which forms the disc and ultimately accretes must have arrived very close to the smbh , with very little angular momentum . on",
    "would not expect such an accurate aim for most of the gas involved in a galaxy merger , so most of this gas evidently can not accrete on to the smbh .",
    "this is reasonable , given that we know ( hring & rix 2004 ) that the mass of the black hole is only about @xmath45 of the galaxy bulge s baryonic mass .",
    "the merger process is evidently extremely inefficient in feeding the black hole , with most growing the bulge or other parts of the host galaxy .",
    "since the accretion disc is so small compared with the galaxy , and involves so little of the gas involved in a merger , this also suggests that its net angular momentum is likely to be uncorrelated with the large  scale structure of the host .",
    "confirmation of this comes from the observed directions of agn jets .",
    "as the jets are relativistic , they must be launched from the very near vicinity of the black hole , normal to the plane of the disc there .",
    "their directions are observed to be uncorrelated with the galaxy structure ( kinney et a. , 2000 ) , just as the argument above suggests .",
    "moreover , successive feeding events seem to produce jets whose directions deviate significantly from the previous ones .",
    "we can now see an emerging picture of agn accretion as a series of very small  scale , chaotic events , whose gas flows have no correlation with the large  scale structure of the galaxy or with each other .",
    "the feeding events must have extremely low specific angular momentum compared with that typical of the gas in a galaxy merger ( king & pringle , 2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "this picture does seem to work well in explaining some key features , in particular the evolution of mass and spin in smbh , and the jet directions discussed above ( king & pringle , 2006 , 2007 ; king et al .",
    ", 2008 ; fanidakis et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the key here is that the black hole spin specifies the efficiency @xmath46 of luminous energy release by accretion , and thus the accretion luminosity @xmath47 the higher the spin , the higher @xmath46 , and thus the _ lower _ the rate at which the black hole mass can grow , because the accretion luminosity can not greatly exceed the eddington limit .",
    "hence rapid black hole growth to high masses , as observed in some high  redshift quasars ( barth et al . , 2003 ; willott et al . , 2003 ) , requires low black  hole spin .",
    "however for some time attempts to understand this process were frustrated because it was thought that the lense  thirring effect would always quickly co  align a misaligned accretion disc with the black hole spin ( scheuer & feiler , 1996 ) . in this case",
    "virtually all accretion takes place through a prograde disc , leading to rapid spin  up to high values of the kerr @xmath48 parameter .",
    "this made it impossible to understand the high smbh masses referred to above without appealing to initial black hole ` seeds ' which were themselves already more massive than many smbh in the low ",
    "redshift universe ( cf volonteri et al . , 2005 ) .",
    "the resolution of this problem was the realization ( king et al . , 2005 ) that the condition for co or counter  alignment actually depends on the magnitudes of the disc and black hole angular momenta , and their initial orientation .",
    "scheuer & feiler s ( 1996 ) paper had implicitly assumed conditions allowing only co  alignment and spinup . using the analytic formula of king et al . , ( 2005 ) and assuming sufficiently small feeding events ( e.g. limited by self ",
    "gravity ) shows that most smbh are likely to have low spins .",
    "the exception is a group in giant ellipticals where a direct coalescence of two smbh has produced a rapid spin ( king et al . , 2008 ; fanidakis et al . , 2009 ) which subsequent randomized gas accretion is too insignificant to dilute .",
    "it appears that this general picture of small  scale , chaotic accretion events is in reasonable accord with observations of agn . however reproducing these conditions",
    "theoretically is a challenge for models of the feeding process ( cf hopkins & quataert , 2009 ) .",
    "similarly , the mechanics of the accretion disc itself , particularly its innermost parts , is the subject of intense research . at a fundamental level , it is now almost universally agreed that magnetic fields are implicated in the ` viscous ' process removing angular momentum from disc material and causing it to accrete ( balbus & hawley , 1991 ) .",
    "however numerical implementations of this idea are not yet definitive ( cf king et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "simulations using the shearing  box approximation appear to suggest that angular momentum removal becomes less efficient as numerical resolution is increased ( fromang & papaloizou , 2007 ) , and as yet no simulation appears to give viscosity as large as that deduced from observation without making the assumption of a net vertical magnetic field ( king et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "given these theoretical problems in describing disc accretion , we are still some distance from a deterministic picture of it .",
    "all galaxies are likely to go through active phases as they grow by mergers . given the rarity of active galaxies among all galaxies , these phases must be relatively short .",
    "accordingly , agn must feed at fairly high rates to grow the observed high smbh masses .",
    "there is no obvious reason why these rates should respect the black hole s eddington limit , so outflows driven by continuum radiation pressure are a natural consequence .",
    "this is an encouraging deduction , as outflows driven by black holes offer a simple way of establishing relations between the smbh and its host galaxy , and hence potential explanations for the @xmath2 and @xmath49 relations ( ferrarese & merritt , 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "however it is clear from ( [ eddrat ] ) that the eddington ratio @xmath50 is limited to modest values in agn .",
    "( this contrasts strongly with accretion in stellar ",
    "mass binary systems because their very short dynamical timescales ( @xmath51 orbital period ) allow extremely high dynamical mass transfer rates and hence @xmath52  for example the well  known binary ss433 has @xmath53 , cf king et al . , 2000 ; begelman et al . , 2006 .",
    ") the electron scattering optical depth @xmath54 in a quasi ",
    "spherical super ",
    "eddington wind scales linearly with @xmath55 , and is of order unity for @xmath56 .",
    "this low scattering depth implies that the total momentum of a @xmath56 agn wind must be of order the photon momentum ( king & pounds , 2003 ) i.e. @xmath57 as is for example also found for the winds of hot stars . using ( [ lacc ] ) with @xmath58 in ( [ mom ] ) gives the wind velocity @xmath59    since the wind moves with speed @xmath60 , it can persist long after the agn is observed to have become sub  eddington .",
    "the duration of the lag is @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the radial extent of the wind . for @xmath63",
    "pc this lag is at least a century , and far longer lags are possible , as we shall see .",
    "this may be the reason why agn showing other signs of super  eddington phenomena ( e.g. narrow  line seyfert 2 galaxies ) are nevertheless seen to have sub ",
    "eddington luminosities ( e.g. ngc 4051 : denney et al . , 2009 ) .    with ( [ v ] ) , the mass conservation equation for the outflow gives the combination @xmath64 specifying the ionization parameter @xmath65 of the wind . here",
    "@xmath66 is the ionizing luminosity , with @xmath67 a dimensionless parameter specified by the quasar spectrum , and @xmath68 is the number density .",
    "this gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "equation ( [ ion2 ] ) shows that the wind momentum and mass rates determine its ionization parameter : for a given quasar spectrum , the predominant ionization state is such that the threshold photon energy defining @xmath72 , and the corresponding ionization parameter @xmath73 , together satisfy ( [ ion2 ] ) .",
    "this requires high excitation : a low threshold photon energy ( say in the infrared ) would imply a large value of @xmath74 , but the high value of @xmath73 then given by ( [ ion2 ] ) would require the presence of very highly ionized species , physically incompatible with such low excitation . for a typical quasar spectrum ,",
    "an obvious self  consistent solution of ( [ ion2 ] ) is @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "this corresponds to a photon energy threshold appropriate for helium or hydrogenlike iron ( i.e. @xmath78  kev ) .",
    "we conclude that    _ eddington winds from agn are likely to have velocities @xmath79 , and show the presence of helium or hydrogenlike iron .",
    "_    a number of such winds are known ( see cappi , 2006 , for a review ) .",
    "this section shows that it is no coincidence that in all cases the wind velocity is @xmath0 , and further that they are all found by identifying blueshifted resonance lines of fe xxv , xxvi in absorption .",
    "conversely , any observed wind with these properties automatically satisfies the momentum and mass relations , strongly suggesting launching by an agn accreting at a slightly super  eddington rate .",
    "it is clear that an eddington wind of the type discussed above can have a significant effect on its host galaxy .",
    "the kinetic power of the wind is @xmath80 where we have used ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ v ] ) .",
    "if the wind persists as the hole doubles its mass ( i.e. for a salpeter time ) , its total energy is @xmath81  erg , where @xmath82 is the hole mass in units of @xmath83 .",
    "this formally exceeds the binding energy @xmath84  erg of a galaxy bulge with baryonic mass @xmath85 and velocity dispersion @xmath86 ( as suggested by the @xmath87 and @xmath2 relations ) . evidently the coupling of wind energy to the galaxy must be inefficient , as black holes would destroy or at least severely modify their host bulges in any significant super  eddington growth phase . as in the corresponding problem for a stellar wind , the interaction with the host must successively involve an inner ( reverse ) shock , slowing the central wind , a contact discontinuity between the shocked wind and the shocked , swept  up",
    "interstellar medium , and an outer ( forward ) shock driven into this medium and sweeping it outwards , ahead of the shocked wind ( see fig .",
    ", whose ionization state makes it observable in x  ray absorption lines .",

    "the inverse compton effect from the quasar s radiation field rapidly cools the shocked gas , removing its thermal energy and strongly compressing and slowing it over a very short radial extent .",
    "this gas may be observable in an inverse compton continuum and lower  excitation emission lines associated with lower velocities .",
    "the cooled gas exerts the preshock ram pressure on the galaxy s interstellar gas and sweeps it up into a thick shell ( ` snowplough ' ) .",
    "this shell s motion drives a milder outward shock into the ambient interstellar medium .",
    "this shock ultimately stalls unless the smbh mass has reached the value @xmath88 satisfying the @xmath2 relation.,width=326 ]    the inefficient coupling of wind energy to the galactic baryons noted above strongly suggests that the shocked wind cools rapidly after passing through the inner shock .",
    "this removes the thermal pressure generated in the shock , and leaves only the preshock ram pressure acting on the interstellar medium .    , velocity @xmath89 and temperature @xmath90 .",
    ", width=326 ]    the required shock cooling is supplied by the inverse compton effect of the quasar s radiation field ( king , 2003 ) .",
    "this field typically has compton temperature @xmath91  k , whereas the formal temperature at the inner adiabatic shock is @xmath92  k. the quasar radiation cools the inner shock efficiently , provided that this is within galaxy  scale distances from the centre ( king , 2003 ) .",
    "inverse compton cooling should produce a component in the quasar spectrum characterized by @xmath93  kev and with a luminosity @xmath94 , i.e. about @xmath95 of the quasar s bolometric output .",
    "note that even if the quasar becomes sub  eddington , leaving a wind persisting for a lag time @xmath96 , its radiation field is still able to cool the shock efficiently .",
    "the gas density jumps by a factor @xmath97 at the adiabatic shock , accompanied by a velocity drop by the same factor .",
    "it is then strongly compressed in the cooling region while the velocity slows to low values ( see fig .",
    "since the cooling is efficient the whole region is very thin compared with the shock radius @xmath98 , and we can regard the shock as locally plane . the rankine ",
    "hugoniot relations across this isothermal shock then show that the mass flow rate @xmath99 remains constant , while the postshock gas pressure drops to the value @xmath100 i.e. the preshock ram pressure . with a constant cooling time , as expected , the postshock temperature and velocity @xmath89 drop approximately linearly with distance behind the shock , and the density rises as @xmath101 , strongly increasing its emission measure .",
    "the gas is likely to be in photoionization equilibrium as it has low optical depth to the quasar radiation , and the increased densities imply short recombination times .",
    "the mass conservation equation and ionization parameter ( [ ion ] ) combine to give @xmath102 in this region .",
    "_ we thus expect a correlation between velocity and excitation .",
    "_ the rapid cooling in this region implies a rapid transition between the immediate postshock regime ( @xmath103 , kev excitation ) and the much slower and cooler compressed state .",
    "there is direct observational evidence for this cooling shock in ngc 4051 ( pounds et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "pounds et al ( 2004 ) had already noted a correlation of outflow velocity with ionization in this source .",
    "given the basic structure sketched in the last section , we can investigate how the shock pattern moves through the interstellar medium of the host galaxy .",
    "the cooled postshock gas exerts the ram pressure ( [ ram ] ) on the undisturbed interstellar medium of the galaxy , driving an outer shock into it and sweeping it up into a relatively dense shell of increasing mass .",
    "the equation of motion of the shell in the momentum ",
    "driven limit is @xmath104 + { gm(r)[m + m_{\\rm tot}(r)]\\over r^2 } =   4\\pi\\rho v^2 = { \\le\\over c } \\label{motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the swept  up interstellar gas mass , @xmath10 is the black hole mass , @xmath106 is the total mass within radius @xmath62 ( including any dark matter ) , and @xmath19 is the gas fraction ( note that in eqn ( 2 ) of king , 2005 the suffix ` tot ' was inadvertently missed off the relevant quantity ) .",
    "far from the black hole ( i.e. for @xmath107 ) the dark matter term @xmath108 becomes dominant in the equation of motion ( [ motion ] ) , and we can drop the black hole mass term involving @xmath10 . for a simple isothermal potential the equation of motion",

    "the quasar radiation field is too dilute to cool the wind shock , and the shell accelerates beyond the escape value , cutting off the galaxy and establishing the black  hole mass  bulge  mass relation ( cf king , 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "we note that ( [ mom ] ) implies a kinetic energy rate @xmath113 implying a mechanical ` energy efficiency ' @xmath114 wrt @xmath115 .",
    "cosmological simulations typically adopt such values in order to produce an @xmath116 relation in agreement with observation ( e.g. di matteo , 2005 ) .",
    "this implicitly means that they adopt the single  scattering momentum relation ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "we shall see below that there must also be an implicit assumption of momentum rather than energy driving , i.e. that the wind interacts with the host galaxy through its ram pressure rather than its energy .",
    "we see from the reasoning of the last section that the interaction beween the quasar wind and its host establishing the @xmath2 relation is  crucially  ` momentum  driven ' rather than ` energy  driven ' .",
    "this equivalent to requiring efficient shock cooling . an energy  driven shock ( e.g. silk & rees , 1998 ) would result in a much smaller black hole mass for for a given @xmath14 than observed . instead of the momentum rate @xmath117 balancing the weight of swept  up gas @xmath118 , which is what produces the momentum",
    " driven relation ( [ msig2 ] ) , an energy ",
    "driven shock would equate the energy deposition rate to the rate of working against this weight . in the near  eddington regime",
    "the result is @xmath119 i.e. @xmath120 which lies well below the observed relation .",
    "the coupling adopted in cosmological simulations evidently ensures that the interstellar medium feels the outflow momentum rather than its energy , in addition to the ` energy efficiency ' @xmath121 noted above .",
    "on large scales the outflows described in section 5.2 above all have ( outer ) shock velocities limited by the bulge velocity dispersion @xmath14 . yet optical and uv observations of various types of galaxies ( holt et al .",
    ", 2008 ; tremonti et al",
    ". , 2007 ) give clear evidence of outflows with velocities of several times this value",
    ". these can not be the central quasar winds with @xmath122 discussed in section 3 .",
    "there is a simple interpretation of such large  scale high  velocity outflows .",
    "consider a galaxy in which the smbh has reached the mass @xmath1 given by eqn ( [ msig2 ] ) , with the cosmic gas fraction @xmath13 .",
    "its bulge gas will probably be severely depleted . in a subsequent minor accretion event triggering agn activity",

    "eddington for a time @xmath124  yr , the agn must drive an outflow shock beyond the radius @xmath125 .",
    "however because of the discrepancy between @xmath19 ( establishing the black hole mass ) , and @xmath126 ( the current gas fraction ) , the shell radius now obeys a modified form of the analytic solution ( [ shell ] ) , namely @xmath127t^2 + 2r_0v_0 t + r_0 ^ 2 \\label{shell2}\\ ] ] where the @xmath115 term involves @xmath19 rather than @xmath126 .",

    "this shows that the shell reaches velocities @xmath131 because its inertia is much lower than the one previously expelled by the eddington thrust in the accretion episode which defined the smbh mass .",
    "if at some point the agn activity turns off , we can match another solution of the form ( [ shell ] ) , but with @xmath115 formally @xmath132 , to the solution ( [ shell2 ] ) .",
    "this solution reveals that a coasting shell stalls only at distances @xmath133 times its radius @xmath134 at the point when agn activity ceased , and thus persists for a timescale @xmath135  yr .",
