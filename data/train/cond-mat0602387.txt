    "low - dimensional gapped quantum antiferromagnets have received much interest in recent years both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "they serve as model substances allowing to investigate in detail the effects of quantum fluctuations and to test theoretical models .",
    "a particularly simple class of materials in this context consists of an assembly of dimers ( two strongly coupled spins 1/2 ) which interact sufficiently weakly to guarantee that the dimer gap does not close .",
    "these materials are characterized by a disordered singlet ground state and a finite spin gap to triplet excited states .",
    "materials of this type occur in nature as quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) ( cu(no@xmath4)@xmath52.5h@xmath6o ) @xcite , quasi two - dimensional ( bacusi@xmath6o@xmath7 ) @xcite and three - dimensional ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) @xcite compounds .",
    "systems of this type are characterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations : thermal fluctuations are controlled by the temperature @xmath10 and the quantum fluctuations of interest in dimer systems ( i.e. those modifying the basic quantum mechanics of isolated dimers ) are governed by the interdimer coupling .",
    "so far , most investigations have concentrated on the quantum aspects , excluding thermal fluctuations by working at zero ( theoretically ) resp .",
    "low ( experimentally ) temperature .",
    "the theoretical approach is then restricted to the low - lying eigenstates of the quantum hamiltonian , which are accessible to an approximate analytical treatment or to numerical calculations . however , at finite temperature of the order of or even large compared to the magnetic exchange energy , all levels participate and more elaborate approximations resp .",
    "numerical approaches are necessary .",
    "recently increasing interest has developped in the finite temperature behavior of such systems and experimental results for cu(no@xmath4)@xmath52.5h@xmath6o @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite demonstrate that an understanding of the interplay of thermal and quantum fluctuations requires additional work on the theoretical and numerical side .",
    "our aim here is to investigate for the system of weakly coupled dimers described above the dynamical structure factor over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures .    to explore from numerical calculations the content of a given hamiltonian for finite temperatures",
    "is more involved than for @xmath11 since the lanczos approach which allows to treat reasonably large systems ( up to 36 spins @xmath0 ) does not give more than a few low - lying energy levels . instead",
    ", the direct approach to dynamic properties at finite temperatures requires full exact diagonalization ( fed ) to obtain energies and wave functions ; this has been done so far for the xxz s=1/2 chain @xcite and the frustrated s=1/2 heisenberg chain @xcite up to 16 spins .",
    "if fed is restricted to energy levels only , thermodynamic properties such as the specific heat , susceptibility and structure factor @xmath12 are obtained ; this has been done for a number of dimer type systems such as the dimerized and frustrated @xmath0 chain @xcite and the two - leg ladder @xcite . these numerical approaches to finite temperatures have been supplemented by approximate analytical approaches such as including thermal occupation factors in the mean field approach @xcite and a strong coupling field theoretic apporach @xcite .",
    "we describe the one dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0 chain with alternating isotropic antiferromagnetic nearest - neigbour exchange ( the bond alternating heisenberg chain , bahc ) as a system of @xmath13 unit cells with two spins each and two exchange constants , the intradimer exchange @xmath3 and the interdimer exchange @xmath14 , using the following hamiltonian : @xmath15 we assume @xmath16 and apply periodic boundary conditions . for @xmath17",
    "the ground state of the system consists of singlets on the intradimer bonds @xmath18 .",
    "these local singlets can be excited to triplets which develop into a band of gapped excitations when switching on @xmath19 . at higher energies multiparticle excitations",
    "dominate the spectrum . in the limit @xmath20",
    "we arrive at the well known heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain ( haf ) with pairs of @xmath0 spinons as lowest gapless excitations .",
    "other related models are described in ref .  .",
    "the dynamics of such a system is most appropriately discussed in terms of the dynamic structure factor , i.e. the fourier transform of the time dependent spin correlation function which , apart from well known prefactors gives the spectral weight measured as the magnetic inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) cross section @xcite .",
    "the dynamic structure factor of the bahc at low temperatures ( @xmath21 ) is characterized by a peak due to singlet - triplet transitions as most prominent feature and continua of multiparticle excitations at higher energies . from extended work on the @xmath11 quantum mechanics of this system ( ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) it is known that finite interdimer coupling @xmath19 leads to considerable modifications in energies and transition strengths for one and two magnon processes as well as to the emergence of bound states below ( and above ) the two magnon band . here",
    "we present results from fed for up to 20 spins for the longitudinal dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath22 for a wide range of temperatures , varying from @xmath21 to @xmath23 .",
    "our discussion will concentrate on the variations of the one and two magnon lineshapes with temperature ( with particular emphasis on the bound state ) and on the temperature dependence of the contributions from the temperature induced central peak at @xmath24 which is due to intraband transitions .",
    "this peak is the signature of spin diffusion in the classical limit ; its temperature dependence has not been discussed so far in a microscopic context , but it is clearly seen in recent ins experiments @xcite .    for @xmath25 spins localized on sites @xmath26 on a 1d lattice the dynamical structure factor is defined as @xmath27 the superscripts @xmath28 denote the spin components and the brackets @xmath29 thermal expectation values ( which for @xmath11 reduce to groundstate expectation values @xmath30 ) . for the isotropic hamiltonian ( no magnetic field ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hambahc ] ) the dynamic structure factor is diagonal with three equal components .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to restrict the discussion in the following to one component , @xmath31 . in the presence of a magnetic field , a case to be treated in subsequent work",
    ", we will have to distinguish between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : limits ] we review and discuss simple limiting situations and our numerical approach , in section [ sec : results ] we present results for the bahc with @xmath19 up to 0.3 and temperatures up to @xmath34 and in the final section [ sec : conclusion ] we discuss the range of validity of our approach and give our conclusions .",

    "the bahc at @xmath11 with its singlet - triplet gap is one of the simplest systems to study strong quantum fluctuations in numerical and analytical approaches .",
    "this has been done by many different methods , among them the random phase approximation @xcite and series expansions in the coupling strength @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the application of these methods has concentrated on two types of low - lying excitations , i.e.  eigenstates of the hamiltonian , above the singlet ground state : ( i ) the basic quantum excitation is the first excited triplet , i.e.  the propagating one magnon excitation ( one excited dimer ) ( ii ) two magnon excitations which form a continuum with the possibility of bound states .",
    "these states are decorated by admixtures of multimagnon excitations which become more and more important when the interdimer coupling @xmath19 increases .",
    "these methods have established the existence of bound states of two excited dimers below the two magnon band , two singlets and two triplets @xcite , for wave vectors close to @xmath44 and energies and transition matrix elements for the one and two magnon bands have been obtained up to @xmath45 order @xcite from series expansions .",
    "we remark that the analogous calculation including 3d interactions has only been done up to @xmath46 order @xcite .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with experiments at low temperatures .    in the limit of vanishing coupling , @xmath17 , on the other hand",
    ", the bahc reduces to an assembly of noninteracting dimers and its exact dynamical structure factor can be easily calculated for all temperatures . in spite of the simplicity of the calculation",
    "the result is instructive as a guide to the general case .",

    "the wavevector @xmath49 is in chain direction and @xmath50 takes only the @xmath13 discrete values @xmath51 of the lattice of dimers ( lattice constant @xmath52 ) .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) shows the two types of contributions which survive the limit @xmath53 , i.e. which are present in the noninteracting dimer limit : ( i ) one magnon excitations with energy @xmath54 ( related in strength by the detailed balance factor @xmath55 ) ; ( ii ) a contribution at @xmath56 which results from transitions ( diagonal terms for @xmath57 ) within the excited dimer triplet .",
    "it therefore carries a factor @xmath58 and will develop into a central peak for @xmath59 .",
    "since all transition processes in this limit are localized , the only nontrivial wavevector dependence results from form factors related to the internal dimer structure : the intradimer distance @xmath60 determines the dimer structure factor @xmath61 and the corresponding factor @xmath62 for the central contribution .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) is independent of @xmath25 since for independent dimers , @xmath63 , the correlation length vanishes and the exact result is obtained already for @xmath64 .",
    "increasing @xmath25 only changes the number of wave vectors @xmath49 and their positions .",
    "this guarantees the extensivity of the sum rule @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the absolute intensity of the one magnon peak at e.g. @xmath66 develops from 1/2 at @xmath11 to 1/8 at @xmath67 .",
    "we note that the various contributions to this intensity from states with a different number of excited dimers depend on @xmath25 as can be identified easily from eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) : the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) , @xmath68 originates from the partition function in the denominator and the phase space factor resulting from excited dimers which do not participate in the transition in the numerator .",
    "the expansion of the numerator thus gives as a series the relative strength of the various contributions with energy @xmath3 starting from a state with @xmath69 excited dimers : the contribution of states with @xmath69 excited dimers is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath71 this reduces to @xmath72 , the degeneracy of states with @xmath69 excited dimers . from this",
    "follows that the various contributions to the dynamic structure factor from states with @xmath69 excited dimers have a well defined maximum ( for @xmath73 ) at @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "this means @xmath76 for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for @xmath67 .",
    "it should be noted that even for @xmath67 the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) is a quantum mechanical result reflecting the discrete energy spectrum of a @xmath0 dimer .",
    "it does not agree with the classical limit which is defined by the limit @xmath79 , i.e.  for spins which are classical vectors or alternatively in the limit @xmath80 . from the latter approach",
    "follows that the frequency regime @xmath81 fills continuously with excitation strength in the classical limit .",
    "the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamicsfzero ] ) can clearly also be generalized to include an external magnetic field , a case which will be treated in a forthcoming paper .    allowing for finite coupling @xmath19 several features",
    "appear : ( i ) the contributions at @xmath82 and @xmath83 acquire a finite width owing to the dispersion of the excitations , ( ii ) additional contributions at @xmath84 appear in increasing order in @xmath19 , ( iii ) the intradimer form factors get modified @xcite . for small coupling @xmath85 , two essential characteristics of the noninteracting limit survive qualitatively as shown for @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] : the correlation length remains small and the density of states continues to show a well defined sequence of peaks with maxima at @xmath87 up to the upper bound of the spectrum and with widths of the order of @xmath19 independent of energy .",
    "thus the largest contributions to the transitions @xmath88 , which start at energies @xmath89 will be included for @xmath90 even for @xmath67 .",
    "we conclude that these system sizes will be sufficient to obtain reasonable results for the bahc structure factor at moderate @xmath19 and all temperatures in its most interesting frequency regimes .    for our numerical calculations",
    "we have used the householder algorithm to obtain all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in the subspace of constant @xmath91 and wavevector .",

    "calculations for @xmath92 are comfortably to perform ( matrix dimension is about 2000 , required memory about 100 mb ) . a few calculations have been performed for @xmath93 for one value of @xmath19 and the wavevector and frequency regime where the bound triplet two magnon state is found ; here memory ( a few gb ) and required cpu time are at the limit what can be reasonably managed at present .",
    "in this section we present our results for @xmath94 . we cover the full range of temperatures ( in units of @xmath3 ) , @xmath95 ( the latter being representative for @xmath67 ) and wave vectors @xmath50 ( in units of @xmath96 ) from 0 to @xmath97 . as standard values we use @xmath92 and @xmath98 .",
    "we find that the variation with @xmath19 for smaller values can be safely found from interpolating the results presented here .",
    "the number of spins strongly influences the level density and the discreteness of reciprocal space ; however , the positions of levels which occur at identical wavevectors for different @xmath25 ( e.g.  the one magnon state and the @xmath2 bound state below the two magnon band at wavevector @xmath44 ) do not change with @xmath25 going from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ( values for @xmath100 were obtained from lanczos diagonalization ) . in this work",

    "<S> interpretation is guided by the exact temperature dependence in the noninteracting dimer limit which remains qualitatively valid up to an interdimer exchange @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature induced central peak around zero frequency is clearly identified and aspects of the crossover to spin diffusion in its variation from low to high temperatures are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the one - magnon peak acquires an asymmetric shape with increasing temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the two - magnon peak is dominated by the @xmath2 bound state which remains well defined up to temperatures of the order of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation with temperature and wavevector of the integrated intensity for one - magnon and two - magnon scattering and of the central peak are discussed .    </S>"
