    "the low co(3 - 2)/co(1 - 0 ) flux ratio implies an excitation temperature of only 5 k. this cold , compact feature may be a result of asymmetries in the disk structure , similar to what has been seen in the co gas of the debris disk around @xmath5 pic @xcite .",
    "further data are needed to confirm the nature of this residual feature .",
    "in the co(3 - 2 ) data there are some 3 - 5@xmath66 residuals , corresponding to @xmath110 - 30%  of the peak flux , that may reflect deviations from our simple model due to e.g. non - keplerian motion or asymmetries in the disk .",
    "higher spatial resolution alma observations of co(3 - 2 ) also find evidence of asymmetric emission in the disk ( white et al . in prep ) . while we assumed lte in our modeling , the densities in our best fitting disk are starting to approach the critical densities of these lines ( n@xmath104 cm@xmath4 ) , which may contribute to the imperfect model . to test our assumption of lte at such low densities we input our density and temperature structure into the line radiative transfer code lime @xcite , which is capable of performing the full nlte calculation .",
    "nlte and lte spectra are indistinguishable indicating that nlte effects are minimal and justifying our use of the lte assumption .",
    "since the residuals do not lead to large discrepancies between the model and data spectra outside of the bright co(1 - 0 ) feature , and we can rule out strong nlte effects , our results are likely representative of the true disk structure .",
    "the hd 141569 system has been referred to in the literature as both a transition disk @xcite and a debris disk @xcite .",
    "its young age , gas disk and active accretion are reminiscent of a protoplanetary disk , although the strength of the infrared excess is much more typical of a debris disk . with constraints on the temperature and density structure of the gas we can compare to typical protoplanetary disks and debris disks to gain insight as to the origin of the gas and dust in the system , as well as their influence on each other ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    around hd 141569 , we observe co gas that extends out to @xmath51=224@xmath79 au with a surface density power law index of @xmath811.7@xmath82 .",
    "typical protoplanetary disks have outer radii that cover a wide range from 15 - 200 au @xcite . is _ not _ the same as the outer edge of a truncated power law , with typically r@xmath1062r@xmath107 for @xmath108 @xcite ] within these tapered power law profiles , the power law portion has an average index of 1 , although with very large dispersion , and much of the power law portion is unresolved @xcite .",
    "these protoplanetary disk profiles are similar to that of the hd 141569 system .",
    "the large inner radius is also similar to those seen in transition disks @xcite although in hd 141569 we find that the co inner radius is similar to the inner radius of the mid - infrared dust emission @xcite , while in transition disks co has been found to extend inside the dust gaps @xcite .",
    "active accretion , at a rate of @xmath16@xmath10910@xmath110 m@xmath29 yr@xmath18 @xcite , indicates that gas exists within the co inner radius although its exact spatial distribution is unknown .",
    "gas that is devoid of co may extend continuously from the co inner radius toward the star ; photodissociation of co should occur in the area close to the star that is directly exposed to high energy radiation from hd 141569 .    while the spatial distribution is similar to protoplanetary disks ,",
    "the mass of the hd 141569 disk is much smaller than in younger systems .",
    "typical protoplanetary disks have gas masses of @xmath110@xmath9 - 10@xmath111 m@xmath29 @xcite while we infer @xmath74=3.8@xmath47 m@xmath29 in the hd 141569 system .",
    "conversely , @xcite , using mid - infrared spectroscopy and single disk mm co spectroscopy , put upper limits on the gas in the outer radii of debris disks of a few earth masses , below what we derive in the hd 141569 system .",
    "our gas mass is similar to that derived using co emission from cold gas in the disks around 49 ceti , with @xmath74=@xmath112 m@xmath29 @xcite , hd 21997 , with @xmath74=8 - 20@xmath113 m@xmath29 @xcite , and hd 131835 with @xmath74=1.3@xmath240.6@xmath113 m@xmath29 @xcite , all examples of massive co disks .",

    "the low gas mass may be a result of the multiple processes that contribute to the removal of co , and gas in general , from the system . at the current rate of accretion the observed gas",
    "would be removed in only @xmath12500 years . even if co - poor gas extended down to 0.1 au , with the same surface density profile as inferred from the outer disk",
    ", accretion would still be able to deplete the disk in @xmath15000 years",
    ". a photoevaporative flow can also remove gas from the disk on similar timescales ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the co itself can be selectively removed through its photodissociation by high energy photons .",
    "the observed co mass would be destroyed in @xmath1200 years , using the photodissociation rates of @xcite and only considering the interstellar radiation field .",
    "this co depletion could be partially offset by a source of replenishments within the disk , such as the collisions of comets and subsequent sublimation and release of trapped volatiles @xcite .",
    "a total of 1.6@xmath10910@xmath115 kg of co would need to be released each year , which corresponds to roughly 12000 hale - bopp size comets , assuming m@xmath116=1.3@xmath117 kg and a 10%  co content .",
    "@xcite find that the mass of the hd 141569 system is on the border of regime where self - shielding significantly diminishes the depletion of co , although their disk mass is an order of magnitude larger than what we have derived here .",
    "the accretion and photoevaporative flows , as well as the photodissociation of co , make it unlikely that the system is in steady state but instead it is likely in the process of transitioning from a gas - rich protoplanetary disk to a gas - poor debris disk @xcite .",
    "our finding of co gas confined to radii smaller than that of the scattered light rings has important implications for the origin of the small dust grains . in a protoplanetary disk , much of which",
    "is shielded from the stellar radiation by the dust itself , the motion of dust grains depends on how well - coupled they are to the gas @xcite . once the disk becomes optically thin , the grains experience an outward force due to radiation pressure , which can often overwhelm the gravitational pull of the central star .",
    "the ratio of radiation to gravitational force is characterized by the parameter @xmath5 , which scales with the stellar luminosity and inversely with the grain size @xcite .",
    "grains with @xmath1180.5 ( @xmath1sub - micron sizes ) are quickly blown out of the system on dynamical timescales , while larger grains settle into orbits at slightly sub - keplerian velocities .",
    "for the larger grains the presence of gas can further affect these orbits .",
    "if the radiation pressure influenced orbit is such that the grains move slower than the gas then they will experience a tail - wind which increases their angular momentum .",
    "these grains will move outward until they reach the outer edge of the gas disk . for hd 141569",
    "this can occur for small - ish grains ( tens of microns ) , while larger grains ( @xmath1 hundreds of microns ) settle into stable orbits within the gaseuous disk where radiation pressure and gas drag balance @xcite .",
    "poynting - robertson drag will drive grains with sizes of tens to hundreds of microns inwards towards the star @xcite .",
    "the combined effect of these processes is a disk with a ring of dust at the outer edge of the gaseous disk , similar to what is seen in the hd 141569 system .    in this scenario",
    "the small dust grains are generated in the inner disk and blown out on dynamical timescales .",
    "@xcite do not find any scattered light inside of 175 au , although they are limited by residuals from subtration of the central star within 0.5 ",
    "( = 54 au ) . resolved imaging in the mid - infrared has found small dust grains as close as 10 - 30 au @xcite . while our 870@xmath35 continuum observations are unresolved , at a spatial resolution corresponding to @xmath1150 au , higher resolution alma observations of the dust continuum find that the dust disk is compact and consistent with the mid - infrared observations ( white et al . in prep ) .",
    "collisions between planetesimals , either due to self - stirring or through secular perturbations by a planet , could generate the inner dust seen in the mid - infrared which is then rapidly blown out of the system , populating the outer scattered light rings . within the 5 myr lifetime of the hd 141569 system ,",
    "the pluto - size planetesimals needed for self - stirring could be created as far out as @xmath170 au @xcite , while a mildly eccentric planet ( e@xmath10.1 ) at the inner edge of the co disk could perturb material out as far as 60 au @xcite .",
    "the relative youth of this system makes in - situ generation of small dust grains in the outer rings unlikley , unless by a planet embedded within the rings , but is consistent with their creation close to the star .",
    "generating small dust grains in the inner disk and having them get blown outward by radiation pressure is consistent with the relative location of the gas and dust , but it does not fully explain the morphology of the outer disk .",
    "@xcite predict a single ring , while two distinct rings are observed @xcite . a saturn - mass planet embedded in the outer disk",
    "could carve out a gap and stir up the grains enough to create two rings @xcite , and @xcite find tentative evidence of a stellocentric offset that is consistent with perturbations from a planet .",
    "another possibility relies on perturbations from one of the two distant companions @xcite . a close passage between one of the companions and the disk",
    "would truncate the disk , and excite dust grains just inside this truncation radius leading to the creation of small dust grains @xcite .",
    "such a passage has been invoked to explain the large , low - surface brightness spiral features in the outer reaches of the disk @xcite .    within the gas disk",
    "we derive an excitation temperature of @xmath75=27@xmath83 k. spitzer observations find typical dust temperatures of 50 - 200 k in debris disks @xcite , with similar results found by herschel @xcite , although this depends strongly on the location and composition of the dust grains . in debris disks the dust temperature at a given radius is often found to be higher than that for blackbody grains , or conversely the observed radial location of the dust grains is larger than predicted for blackbody grains @xcite .",
    "previous models of dust emission from the hd 141569 system @xcite find typical dust temperatures of 50 - 200k in the outer disk , higher than our estimated blackbody temperature of 51 k , consistent with the presence of small dust grains .",
    "while in the hd 141569 system we find a gas temperature that is lower than that of the dust , it is important to keep in mind that we directly measure a gas excitation temperature that , under certain conditions , can be equated to the gas kinetic temperature and the dust temperature .",
    "@xcite find that in hd 21997 the gas excitation temperature implied by the co lines is much lower than the expected dust temperature , similar to what is seen here .",
    "the deviation of the gas temperature from an optically thin disk of blackbody grains may be a property of a low density disk in which the collisions of the gas and dust are not frequent enough to equilibrate their temperatures . while the midplane gas densities reach 10@xmath119 - 10@xmath120 cm@xmath4 , without detailed modeling of the dust emission we can not know if the gas is well - mixed with the dust or if it is subject to a much different radial distribution .",
    "the low density environment in debris disks can lead to substantial differences between the gas and dust temperature @xcite , although these models predict the gas temperature to be much higher than the dust temperature .",
    "the hd 141569 disk is more massive than the @xmath5 pic and vega type disks considered by @xcite , which could lead to additional processes lowering the disk temperature .",
    "@xcite predict [ oi ] and [ cii ] play a large role in gas cooling , while @xcite , in their modeling of the hd 141569 system , find that co itself can play a major role .",
    "strong far - infrared emission from [ oi ] and [ cii ] , at levels more comparable to protoplanetary disks than to debris disks , has been measured from the disk around hd 141569 @xcite although these lines may only contribute significantly to the upper low density regions of the disk rather than the midplane being traced by our co observations .",
    "two - dimensional photodissociation region models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) predict that at the densities where co becomes the dominant coolant , but before collisional equilibrium with the dust sets in , the gas temperature can drop below that of the dust . with dust temperatures of @xmath12150k , co will not freeze - out onto dust grains but instead will continue to exist in the gas phase where it can continue to efficiently radiate away thermal energy .    comparing our derived gas temperature to these models",
    "assumes that the excitation temperature is equivalent to the gas kinetic temperature , while nlte effects can cause these two temperatures to diverge .",
    "our nlte vs lte test rules out significant nlte effects , but it did so under the assumption of co / h@xmath34=10@xmath9 .",
    "a diminished h@xmath34 abundance will lead to fewer collisions and a deviation between the excitation temperature inferred by our data and the kinetic temperature predicted by the models .",
    "@xcite find that , in the case of the debris disk around fomalhaut , the density and nature of the collision partners can induce nlte effects that strongly affect the gas mass derived from co upper limits . further modeling is needed to fully explore the possibility of a low - density nlte dominated disk as a fit to our observed co emission .",
    "the disk around hd 141569 likely represents a stepping stone between a fully optically thick primordial disk and a more evolved debris disk @xcite . using co(3 - 2 ) and co(1 - 0 )",
    "we have spatially resolved the cold gas emission from the disk around hd 141569 .",
    "we have found that the gas has a large inner hole , and extends out to , but does not overlap with , the outer scattered light dust rings .",
    "this configuration is consistent with the generation of small grains within the inner disk , followed by interactions with the gas and the stellar radiation field that pushes them outward until they collect just beyond the outer edge of the gaseous disk .",
    "the dust may then be further stirred by a recent passage of one of the companions creating the observed multi - ring structure .",
    "while the co gas mass is much lower than seen in protoplanetary disks , the active accretion and wide radial extent are consistent with a primordial protoplanetary disk origin , rather than the release of co through collisions of gas - rich comets .",
    "we also find that the gas excitation temperature is colder than the equivalent blackbody dust temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the behavior seen in the gaseous debris disk hd 21997 @xcite but inconsistent with predictions from models @xcite possibly due to enhanced cooling from co itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or nlte effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "overall the data indicate a circumstellar disk in a later stage of its protoplanetary evolution , with a diminishing gaseous disk that may not be large enough to create a gas giant planet , but can still influence the distribution of the small dust grains .",

    "<S> the disk around hd 141569 is one of a handful of systems whose weak infrared emission is consistent with a debris disk , but still has a significant reservoir of gas . </S>",
    "<S> here we report spatially resolved mm observations of the co(3 - 2 ) and co(1 - 0 ) emission as seen with the sma and carma . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the excitation temperature for co is lower than expected from cospatial blackbody grains , similar to previous observations of analogous systems , and derive a gas mass that lies between that of gas - rich primordial disks and gas - poor debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> the data also indicate a large inner hole in the co gas distribution and an outer radius that lies interior to the outer scattered light rings . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial distribution , with the dust rings just outside the gaseous disk , is consistent with the expected interactions between gas and dust in an optically thin disk . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that gas can have a significant effect on the location of the dust within debris disks . </S>"
