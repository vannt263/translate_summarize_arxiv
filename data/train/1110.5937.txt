    "the centers of low - luminosity spheroids , @xmath5 , are often marked by the presence of compact stellar nuclei with half - light radii of a few parsecs and luminosities that are @xmath6 times that of a typical globular cluster @xcite .",
    "the nearest such system is at the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the milky way nsc is close enough that its radial and kinematical structure can be resolved @xcite .",
    "its total mass is estimated at @xmath7 @xcite and its half - light radius is roughly 3 - 5 pc @xcite .",
    "there is a central core of radius @xmath8 pc @xcite , beyond which the density falls off roughly as @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "nscs with properties similar to those of the milky way have now been detected in galaxies of all hubble types ; a review of their properties is given by @xcite .",
    "nscs exhibit complex star formation histories ; while the bulk of the stars appear to always be old , the fraction of young stars increases toward late - type galaxies . in galaxies beyond the local group , nscs are typically unresolved , and the only structural properties that can be derived are half - light radii and total luminosities .",
    "the study of nscs has raised considerable interest because of the fairly strong correlations between their masses and the properties ( mass , velocity dispersion ) of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "these correlations suggest that the formation of nscs and their host galaxies are linked in important ways .",
    "two models for the formation of nscs have been widely discussed . in the in - situ formation model ,",
    "buildup of molecular gas near the center of a galaxy leads to episodic star formation events  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "a nsc consists mostly of stars that formed locally @xcite .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been discussed for bringing the gas to the center , including the magneto - rotational instability in a differentially rotating gas disk @xcite , tidal compression in shallow density profiles @xcite or dynamical instabilities @xcite .    alternatively , in the merger model , globular clusters sink to the center of a galaxy via dynamical friction and merge to form a compact stellar system @xcite .",
    "observations of nscs in dwarf elliptical galaxies suggest that the majority of such nuclei might have formed in this way @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have also shown that the basic properties of nscs are consistent with a merger origin @xcite .",
    "in addition to a nsc , the milky way also contains a massive black hole ( smbh ) whose mass , @xmath10 @xcite , is comparable with that of the nsc . a handful of other galaxies are also known to contain both a nsc and a smbh@xcite , and the ratio of smbh  to nsc mass in these galaxies is of order unity .",
    "the possibility of a direct link between the population of intermediate mass black holes that might form in orbitally decaying star clusters and the growth of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies has also been suggested in previous papers  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a simple argument leads to a @xmath11  pc scale as the relevant one for the merger model for the formation of nscs .",
    "the beginning of the disruption process of a globular cluster due to tidal stresses from a smbh  is expected when it passes within a certain distance of the galaxy center , limiting the density within that radius .",
    "disruption occurs at a distance @xmath12 from the smbh , where @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the central ( core ) density of the globular cluster , @xmath15 its central , one - dimensional velocity dispersion , and @xmath16 its core radius ; the second relation is the `` core - fitting formula '' @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath17 for the gravitational influence radius of the smbh , where @xmath18 is the stellar velocity dispersion in the nsc , equation  ( [ eq : rtidal ] ) becomes @xmath19 setting @xmath20  pc and @xmath21  km  s@xmath22 , values characteristic of the most massive globular clusters , we find @xmath23  pc for the milky way .",
    "this is roughly equal to the radius of the core ( @xmath8 pc ) that is observed in the distribution of late - type stars @xcite .    in this paper , we use direct @xmath0-body simulations to test the merger model for the formation of the milky way nsc .",
    "our initial conditions consist of a smbh  and a diffuse stellar component that models the inner parts of the nuclear stellar disk @xcite .",
    "the nsc is built up by the successive inspiral of globular clusters , which we inject into the system at a radius of 20 pc .",
    "the clusters are assigned masses and radii consistent with those of globular clusters that were initially very massive ( @xmath24 ) but which were tidally limited by the galaxy s tidal field . as the clusters spiral in due to dynamical friction against the stars in the disk component ,",
    "they eventually come within the radius of tidal disruption of the smbh .",
    "we follow 12 such inspirals , resulting in the accumulation of @xmath25 .",
    "the nsc that results has properties that are consistent with the observed properties of the milky way nsc , including a @xmath26 density profile and a parsec - scale core .    at the galactic center ,",
    "the relaxation time at sgra * s influence radius is roughly @xmath27 gyr , assuming solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "this is too long for a bahcall - wolf  ( 1976 ) cusp to have formed over the galaxy s lifetime , consistent with the observed lack of a cusp @xcite . but a pre - existing core with radius smaller than the smbh  influence radius would have shrunk appreciably over a time of 10 gyr due to gravitational encounters @xcite .",
    "we investigate the effect of such evolution on our nsc model by continuing the @xmath0-body integrations after the final infall event , for a time that corresponds to roughly @xmath28  gyr after scaling to the milky way .",
    "the core radius decreases by roughly a factor of two in this time , bringing it to a size that is more consistent with the observed core size .",
    "the density profile beyond the core remains nearly unchanged .    since",
    "galactic globular clusters are almost exclusively ancient objects with typical ages@xmath29gyr  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the merger model predicts that the bulk of the nuclear population is in old stars .",
    "accordingly , using _",
    "hubble space telescope _ near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer  ( nicmos ) imaging of the inner @xmath30pc of the galaxy , we show that the luminosity function of the milky way nsc is consistent with the hypothesis that a large fraction of its mass is in ancient stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of our initial models are given in section  2 .",
    "section  3 describes our simulations and results .",
    "section  4 is devoted to the study of the collisional evolution of the nsc following its formation .",
    "the implications of our results in the contest of nscs and galactic center dynamics are discussed in section  5 . section  6 sums up .",
    "in the following , we describe direct n - body simulations that were used to study the consecutive infall and merging of a set of 12 globular clusters each starting from a galactocentric distance of @xmath31  pc .",
    "the total mass of the 12 , tidally - truncated clusters sums to @xmath32 , roughly the observed mass of the milky way nuclear star cluster  @xcite .",
    "we chose 12 because this number permits a particularly elegant algorithm for generating the orbital initial conditions that does not favor any particular direction , as described in section 2.2 .",
    "after the first cluster had spiraled in to the center and reached a nearly steady state ( as evaluated via lagrange radii ) , we added the second cluster .",
    "this procedure was iterated until 12 clusters accumulated and merged in the inner region of the galaxy where we initially placed a central smbh .",
    "snapshots from the simulations are given in figure  [ snap ] .",
    "this scheme has been adopted to represent a realistic frame where the time interval between two consecutive globular cluster infalls and mergers to the center is longer than the time required for a single globular cluster to reach a quasi - steady state following its merger into the growing nsc . in any case , the results of the following simulations are robust and not depend ( as far as the structure of the emerging nsc is concerned ) much on specific initial conditions , as we discuss at the end of subsection  [ densityp ] .",
    "we now outline the details of the initial conditions adopted in the simulations .",
    "the nuclear bulge is distinguished from the larger galactic bulge ( effective radius @xmath33 ) by its flat disk - like morphology , high stellar densities , and a history of continuous star formation .",
    "the nuclear bulge dominates the inner @xmath34 of the milky way and it appears as a , distinct , massive disk - like complex of stars and molecular clouds which is , on a large scale , symmetric with respect to the galactic center .",
    "it consists of an @xmath35 nuclear stellar cluster within the inner @xmath36pc , a larger nuclear stellar disk and a nuclear molecular disk of same size ( radius @xmath37 and scale height @xmath38 ) .",
    "the total stellar mass and luminosity of the nuclear bulge are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath35 density distribution holds only within the nsc in the central @xmath41 , while , at larger radii , the mass distribution is dominated by the nuclear stellar disk which has essentially a flat density profile @xcite . the initial conditions for the galaxy in our simulations model the nuclear stellar disk and they omit the central nsc .",
    "accordingly , they correspond to a shallow density cusp around a smbh , which is included as a massive particle , @xmath42m@xmath43 , located at the origin .",
    "we adopted a truncated power - law model for this component : @xmath44 where @xmath45m@xmath46pc@xmath47 is the density at @xmath48pc , and the truncation function is the same used by @xcite . since @xmath49 for @xmath50 , the model is essentially a power law at @xmath51 , but it tends exponentially to zero for @xmath52 .",
    "we chose @xmath53 , corresponding to the shallowest power law consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution in a point - mass potential .",
    "the resulting model implies a mass density at @xmath54 similar to what is found in the galaxy outside the nsc ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we chose @xmath56pc which gives a total mass of the ( truncated ) galactic model equal to @xmath57 .      the number of particles used to represent the galaxy was @xmath63 , which implies a mass of @xmath64 for each particle in the system .",
    "the globular clusters were initially placed on circular orbits with orbital radii @xmath65  pc . in order not to favor any particular direction for the inspiral",
    ", the orbital angular momenta were selected in the following way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the surface of a sphere can be tessellated by means of 12 regular pentagons , the centers of which form a regular dodecahedron inscribed in the sphere .",
    "the coordinates of the centers of these pentagons were identified with the tips of the 12 orbital angular momentum vectors . in this way , the inclination and longitude of ascending node of each initial orbit were determined .",
    "the choice of circular orbits was motivated by the well - known effect of orbital circularization due to dynamical friction @xcite .    at a distance of 20 pc from the galactic center",
    ", a globular cluster would already have been subject to tidal forces from the galaxy and the smbh , and its total mass and radius would be less than their original values when the globular cluster was far from the center .",
    "we assumed that the _ central _ properties of the globular clusters were unaffected by tidal forces during the inspiral to 20 pc , and adopted values characteristic of massive clusters : central velocity dispersion @xmath66  km s@xmath22 and core radius @xmath20  pc .",
    "if the dimensionless central ( king ) potential is @xmath67 , the total mass works out to be @xmath68 .",
    "this value of @xmath15 is roughly two times the maximum value of @xmath69 km s@xmath22 listed in @xcite s compilation of galactic globular clusters properties , while the core radius is roughly equal to the median value in that compilation .",
    "our choice of such a large value for @xmath15 is justified by the fact that only massive clusters , if they are compact enough , could have arrived in the central regions of the galaxy in a reasonable time without being destroyed by galactic tidal forces in the process ( miocchi et al .",
    "2006 and   [ dfts ] ) .",
    "we then needed to generate equilibrium models for globular clusters with these same central properties , but with total masses and limiting ( tidal ) radii consistent with the known tidal forces from the galaxy model at 20 pc .",
    "this is not a completely straightforward exercise , since the gravitational force from the globular cluster acting on a star at the cluster s limiting radius , @xmath70 , depends both on @xmath70 and on the cluster mass @xmath71 within @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a function of @xmath70 .",
    "we proceeded in the following way .",
    "we first assumed @xmath72 .",
    "in this case , a king - like model satisfies the following relation between @xmath71 and @xmath70 : @xmath73 given this relation , the tidal radius can then be related to the galactic potential @xmath74 and density @xmath75 by ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath76^{-1/2}\\label{eq : rt}.\\ ] ] using the galaxy mass distribution of equation ( 4 ) and considering the presence of the smbh , but ignoring the truncation function , we find @xmath77 giving a limiting radius of @xmath78^{-1/2}\\ ] ] and a tidally - truncated mass from equation  ( [ eq : mt ] ) .",
    "adopting a distance @xmath65  pc we find @xmath79pc and @xmath80  m@xmath43 ; in other words , roughly @xmath81 of the globular cluster mass would have been removed in the process of inspiralling to @xmath82 .",
    "we then equated this @xmath71 with the mass of a new king model having the same core properties : @xmath83 here @xmath84 is a function of the dimensionless central potential that is tabulated by @xcite .",
    "since all the quantities in equation  ( [ eq : mtmk ] ) are known except for @xmath85 , we can solve for this variable , and find @xmath86 .",
    "the three parameters @xmath87 then uniquely define the king model that was used to generate the initial conditions of the globular clusters .",
    "as previously stated , the mass of the single particle in the galaxy was @xmath88 .",
    "for the particles in the clusters we choose @xmath89 , approximately one half of that value . with this choice ,",

    "<S> in one widely discussed model for the formation of nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) , massive globular clusters spiral into the center of a galaxy and merge to form the nucleus . it is now known that at least some nscs coexist with supermassive black holes ( sbhs ) ; this is the case , for instance , in the milky way . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate how the presence of a smbh  at the center of the milky way impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its nsc . starting from a model consisting of a low - density nuclear stellar disk and the smbh , </S>",
    "<S> we use direct @xmath0-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc , and their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent with the galactic tidal field at that radius . </S>",
    "<S> these clusters , decayed orbitally in the central region due to their large mass , were followed in their inspiral events ; as a result , the total accumulated mass by @xmath1 clusters is about @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> each cluster is disrupted by the smbh  at a distance of roughly one parsec . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile that results after the final inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius , and an envelope with density that falls off @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are similar to those of the milky way nsc , with the exception of the core size , which in the milky way is somewhat smaller . </S>",
    "<S> but by continuing the evolution of the model after the final inspiral event , we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational encounters in a time ( when scaled to the milky way ) of 10 gyr as the stellar distribution evolves toward a bahcall - wolf cusp . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the luminosity function of the milky way nsc is consistent with the hypothesis that 1/2 of the mass comes from old ( @xmath4 gyr ) stars , brought in by globular clusters , with the other half due to continuous star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the mass of the milky way is due to infalling globular clusters is consistent with existing observational constraints . </S>"
