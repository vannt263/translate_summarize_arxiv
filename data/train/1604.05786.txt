    "a major concern of space weather is solar energetic particle events ( seps ) . in many seps",
    ", ions can reach energies @xmath8 gev / nuc .",
    "it is now largely believed that these energetic particles are accelerated at / near the sun via mainly solar flares and/or coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "historically `` impulsive '' events refer to those events where particles are accelerated at flares and `` gradual '' events refer to those where particles are accelerated by cme - driven shocks @xcite .",
    "often large sep events are gradual events and are almost always associated with fast cmes . on the other hand , it has been noted for a long time that not all fast cmes can be associated with sep events measured in the near earth environment by goes and/or ace @xcite .",
    "to explain the observed high intensity of seps in large sep events , @xcite noted that the ambient energetic particle intensity prior to the event may be important in causing a large sep event .",
    "the origins of these seed particles may be preceding impulsive flares @xcite or preceding cmes @xcite .    in an earlier study of @xmath9 large sep events that had intensity @xmath10 pfu ( particle flux units , 1  pfu = 1  proton@xmath11 ) at @xmath10 mev",
    ", @xcite showed that there exists a strong correlation between high particle intensity and preceding cmes . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "a preceding cme occurs within @xmath6 hours of the primary cme .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite suggested that if two cmes erupt closely in time and both drive shocks , then the shock driven by the preceding cme can lead to a much enhanced turbulence at the shock driven by the second cme , therefore lead to a more effective acceleration process and a large sep event . based on a simple estimation of the acceleration time scale , @xcite showed that the maximum particle energy at the second shock can be @xmath12 times larger than that at a single shock case . @xcite also noted that the preceding shock can provide seed particles for the main shock .",
    "later , in a study of @xmath13 ground level enhancement ( gle ) events in solar cycle @xmath14 , @xcite found that there were always preceding cmes within @xmath3 hours of the main cme .",
    "this led @xcite to propose the twin - cme scenario for gle events . in this scenario ,",
    "two cmes erupt from the same active region ( ar ) closely in time .",
    "the first cme drives a shock , which , although can accelerate particles , but may not reach energies above @xmath15 mev / nucleon .",
    "as particles are accelerated and escape from shock front , they will excite alfvn waves upstream the shock which get transmitted to downstream of the shock and are enhanced .",
    "when the second cme and its driven shock propagate into this wave - enhanced region , which is also populated by pre - accelerated ions , more efficient particle acceleration will occur and particles can be accelerated to very high energies . in the twin - cme scenario , magnetic reconnection between field lines that drape the second cme and that enclose the first cme may occur . as such , the material inside the first cme s driver can be processed by the second cme , leading to a possible enhancement of heavy ions that are compositionally flare - like @xcite .",
    "continue the work of @xcite , @xcite tested the twin - cme scenario against all large sep events and fast cmes with speed @xmath1 900 km / s from the western hemisphere in solar cycle @xmath14 .",
    "they found that many single fast cmes do not lead to large sep events and most large sep events agree with the twin - cme scenario .",
    "they also noted that the peak fluxes in those sep events that are associated with `` twin cmes '' show no correlation with the speed of the associated fast cmes , nor with the associated flare classes . to examine if the seed population plays an important role in causing a large sep event",
    ", @xcite examined the daily average low energy seed proton intensity 24 hours prior to sep onset time .",
    "they found that for single - cme events there seems to exist a correlation between the low energy seed intensity and the sep peak flux .",
    "for twin - cme events , however , no such correlation exists .",
    "this can be nicely explained by the twin - cme scenario because the presence of a preceding cme can effectively lead to an enhanced seed population , therefore no pre - existing seed population is needed .",
    "the work of @xcite was a statistical study .",
    "lately @xcite examined the 17 may 2012 gle event , the first gle of solar cycle @xmath6 . using multiple spacecraft observations , these authors identified two ejections , with a separation of only @xmath16 minutes in the 17 may 2012 event .",
    "for such a small separation , not only the enhanced turbulence at the second shock is important in accelerating particles , the trapping of particles between the two shocks can also lead to extra contribution to the acceleration process .    according to @xcite",
    ", two cmes occur within @xmath3 hours can be regarded as twin cmes . if the separation between the two cmes exceed @xmath3 hours , they are regarded as single cmes .",
    "the same interval was also use in @xcite .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath3 hours is based on a crude estimate of the decay time of the turbulence downstream of the first cme - driven shock @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is best regarded as a practical choice with ambiguity .",
    "can we obtain a better choice of the time lag between the two cmes so that they are classified as twin cmes ?",
    "we address this question in this work .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : data ] we discuss the data selection and analysis procedure ; in section  [ sect : result ] we present our analysis results ; section  [ sect : disc ] contains the discussions and the conclusions .",
    "for the cmes , we use the list from @xcite , which include @xmath0 fast and wide cmes covering the range of 1997 to 2006 . the identification criteria of these cmes are @xcite : ( 1 ) the speed is faster than 900 km / s,(2 ) the angular width ( wd ) is larger than @xmath17 , and ( 3 ) the source location is on the western hemisphere with a longitude smaller than @xmath18",
    ". the definition of a large sep event can be subjective . as a working definition , we use the proton event list from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) `` solar proton events affecting the earth environment '' list at http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/indices/spe.txt as our large sep event list .",
    "note that the space weather prediction center ( swpc ) space weather operations ( swo ) defines an event with an intensity @xmath19 pfu in the @xmath19 mev channel of the geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) instrument as a minor solar radiation storm event .    in identifying the preceding cmes",
    ", we follow @xcite and use both eit observations and lasco observations .",
    "movies are examined manually on a case by case basis to identify the ar for the preceding cmes . for disk events ,",
    "the identification of ar source regions ( e.g. flares ) of these preceding cmes is relatively easy . for limb events or events with source region having longitudes @xmath20",
    ", the identification of the ar can be sometimes tricky . in a future study",
    "we plan to examine large sep events in solar cycle 24 where observations from stereos can help to remove some of the source region ambiguities .",
    "we also follow @xcite and @xcite and set a speed threshold of @xmath21 km / s .",
    "we use the plane of sky speed . depending on the source ar longitude and the propagation direction",
    ", the projected speed can be somewhat larger .",
    "our choice of @xmath21 km / s being the threshold is such that the preceding cme is most likely super - alfvnic , therefore capable of driving a shock @xcite . besides the cdaw data center catalog at http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme_list/",
    ", we also make use of another two online catalogs including the solar eruptive event detection system ( seeds ) catalog at http://spaceweather.gmu.edu/seeds/ @xcite , and the computer aided cme tracking ( cactus ) catalog at http://sidc.oma.be/cactus/ @xcite .",
    "we use the cdaw database if a cme exists in multiple databases .",
    "based on these conditions , we identify all preceding cmes for any given main cme up to @xmath6 hrs .",
    "we list the main cmes and the corresponding preceding cmes in table  [ table.1 ] .",
    "the first column in table  [ table.1 ] is the event number .",
    "the second column is the onset time of the main cme .",
    "the third column is the noaa active region ( ar ) number , and ` fp ' denotes events that have no noaa ar numbers .",
    "column @xmath22 is the location of the source region at the time of the main cme erupting .",
    "column @xmath23 are the onset time of each preceding cme of main cme within 24hrs .",
    "the column labelled ` p1 ' lists the closest preceding cmes ahead the main cmes ; similarly the ` p2 ' column lists the second closest preceding cmes , and the ` p3 ' column lists the third closest preceding cmes , and so on . in these columns",
    "symbol ` - ' denotes that no preceding cmes are identified .",
    "the ` * ' symbol in column 15 denotes that a large sep event is produced .",
    "for our analysis , we follow @xcite and categorize all cmes in our study to four groups .",
    "group i are `` twin cmes '' that lead to large seps ; group ii are single cmes that lead to large seps ; group iii are `` twin cmes '' that do not lead to large seps ; and group iv are single cmes that do not lead to large seps .",
    "we use @xmath24 where @xmath25i , ii , iii , iv to denote the number of events in each of these @xmath22 groups . clearly , @xmath26 depends on the choice of the time lag @xmath4 between the preceding cme and the main cme .",
    "figure  [ fig : pieplot ] shows the statistic pie chart of the number of events in all four groups as @xmath4 increases from 1  hr to 24  hrs . in figure",
    "[ fig : pieplot ] , @xmath27 is shown as blue , @xmath28 red , @xmath29 green , and @xmath30 yellow . the first row is for @xmath31,2,3,4 hrs , the second row is for @xmath32,6,7,8 hrs , etc .    to examine how good the choice of @xmath3 hrs is",
    ", we consider the following quantities which are formed from the number of events in each group :    @xmath33    so @xmath34 is the ratio of number of twin cmes that lead to large seps to the total number of twin cmes ; @xmath35 is the ratio of number of twin cmes that lead to large seps to the total number of large seps ; @xmath36 is the ratio of number of single cmes that do not lead to large seps to the total number of single cmes ; and @xmath37 is the ratio of the total number of twin cmes to the total number of cmes .",
    "note that @xmath34 is the same of @xmath38 , up to a constant . as we explain below",
    ", we use @xmath37 as an auxiliary quantity to remove the general @xmath4 dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "we now vary the time interval @xmath4 from @xmath5 hr to @xmath6 hrs with a one - hour time step and examine how @xmath39 vary with @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that twin cmes are much more efficient than single cmes in accelerating particles and most of the large sep events are caused by twin cmes .",
    "our goal is to identify the time lag @xmath40 that defines two cmes as twin cmes .",
    "note , as discussed in @xcite , @xmath40 is physically related to the decay time scale of the turbulence downstream of the first shock .",
    "we assume that the effect of the first cme on particle acceleration at the shock driven by the second cme can be ignored when two cmes from the same ar are separated by a time @xmath41 .    clearly as @xmath4 increases",
    ", the number of twin cmes that lead to large seps ( i.e. @xmath27 ) increases ; at the same time , the total number of events that can be categorized as twin cmes ( i.e. @xmath42 ) also increases .",
    "when @xmath4 is larger than @xmath40 , however , the effect of the preceding cme on the main cme becomes negligible , then as @xmath4 further increases , @xmath27 remains almost unchanged but @xmath43 keeps increasing , therefore we expect to see a drop of @xmath44 at @xmath40",
    ". next consider @xmath45 .",
    "first note that the denominator of @xmath45 , which is the total number of seps , is a constant ; the numerator , @xmath27 , increases as @xmath4 increases .",
    "initially when @xmath46 , the increase rate of @xmath27 is fast .",
    "if all large seps are caused by twin cmes , then when @xmath41 , @xmath27 stops increasing and becomes a constant .",
    "of course , not all large seps are caused by twin cmes and some single cmes can also lead to large seps , so @xmath27 still increases when @xmath41 , but will be at a much smaller rate than when @xmath46 .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 will increase with @xmath4 , but the increase rate will show a clear drop at @xmath47 . note that one may wonder if the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath4 may be due to simply the fact that the total number of twin cmes increases with @xmath4 . to examine that , an auxiliary ratio @xmath37 is also considered .",
    "this is the total number of twin cmes ( i. e. @xmath27 and @xmath29 ) to the total number of cmes .",
    "since when @xmath46 , @xmath27 increases as @xmath4 increases , so @xmath48 also increases with @xmath4 .",
    "we therefore expect the general trend of @xmath37 is similar to @xmath35 when @xmath46 .",
    "however , when @xmath41 , @xmath27 stops increasing with @xmath4 , but @xmath29 , therefore @xmath48 still increases with @xmath4 .",
    "so the similar trend of @xmath35 and @xmath37 will stop at @xmath41 .",
    "finally consider @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , both the number of single cmes not leading to seps ( i.e. @xmath30 ) and the total number of single cmes ( i.e. @xmath50 ) decreases , but the latter decreases faster ( since a lot of single fast cmes do not lead to large seps ) . therefore @xmath51 increases with @xmath4 until @xmath40 , after which a decrement of @xmath30 will likely lead to a decrement @xmath28 , so we expect the increase rate of @xmath49 ( i.e. the slope ) to also drop around @xmath40 , similar to @xmath45",
    ".    figure  [ fig : percentage ] plots @xmath34 ( red ) , @xmath35 ( blue ) , @xmath36 ( cyan ) , and @xmath37 ( green ) . as we explained above , the best indicator of @xmath40",
    "is @xmath34 .",
    "this is because the variation of @xmath34 is very gradual , so even a change of @xmath52 can be clearly identified . from the figure",
    "we can see that there is a noticeable drop of @xmath34 at @xmath53 hrs .",
    "furthermore , the slope of @xmath35 and @xmath36 show significant decreases at @xmath54 hrs .",
    "note that although @xmath37 increases with @xmath4 in a similar manner as @xmath35 when @xmath55 hrs ( as it should ) , after @xmath56 hrs , it keeps increasing with the same rate until @xmath57hrs while @xmath35 becomes roughly a constant between @xmath58 hrs .",
    "the @xmath4-dependence of the ratios of @xmath34 to @xmath37 agree nicely to the prediction of the twin - cme scenario .",
    "figure  [ fig : percentage ] suggests a reasonable choice of @xmath40 for the twin - cme scenario is between @xmath59 and @xmath7 hours . since @xmath34 is the most sensible quantity to @xmath40 , we set @xmath60 hrs in the following",
    ".    some useful knowledge concerning large seps can be immediately read off from figure  [ fig : pieplot ] and figure  [ fig : percentage ] .",
    "for example , with @xmath61 hrs as the criteria for twin cmes , we find that @xmath62 twin cmes lead to large seps . in comparison , only @xmath63 single cmes lead to large seps .",
    "furthermore , we also find that , from figure  [ fig : pieplot ] , the percentage of twin cmes in large sep events is @xmath64 , which is significantly higher than @xmath65 , the percentage of twin cmes in all fast and wide cmes .",
    "these conclusions are particularly useful for space weather forecasting .    in @xcite",
    ", we examined the correlation between the peak intensity and the flare class , the main cme speed , and the seed population for both twin cmes and single cmes , assuming @xmath66 hrs . now with the choice of @xmath61 hrs , these are replotted in figure  [ fig.corr_flare ] , figure  [ fig.corr_cme ] and figure  [ fig.corr_seed ] .",
    "in all three figures , the red dots are sep events caused by single cmes and the blue crosses are sep events caused by twin cmes .",
    "there were @xmath3 seps which were caused by single cmes , all of them have their peak intensities below @xmath67 pfu .    from these figures",
    "we see that for both single cme and twin cme events , neither the flare class , nor the cme speed , nor the 24-hour prior ace / uleis ( ultra low energy isotope spectrometer , uleis , @xcite ) ion measurements correlates well with the peak intensity of the event .",
    "note however , that the uleis measurement at 1au , which we use here as a proxy of the seed population , does not necessarily reflect the pre - event plasma environment close to the sun .",
    "our results support the previous work by @xcite who concluded that flare class and cme speeds are not good indicators of event magnitude .",
    "there are @xmath68 events with peak intensity @xmath69 pfu .",
    "all of them are twin - cme events .",
    "this is an important observation .",
    "it clearly shows that event magnitude has a strong dependence on the presence of a preceding cme .",
    "in this work , we extend the work of @xcite and further examined the twin - cme scenario . in particular , we examined what is the best value of the time interval threshold @xmath4 in identifying a twin - cme event . for all fast and wide cmes and large seps identified in @xcite , we vary @xmath4 from @xmath5 to @xmath6 hours and found that the best value of @xmath4 is @xmath70 hours .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , if a preceding cme ( and its driven shock ) occurs within @xmath7 hrs of a main cme , it can provide both an enhanced turbulence and enhanced seed population at the second shock , leading to a more efficient acceleration .",
    "in @xcite the value of @xmath4 corresponds to the decay time of the turbulence downstream the first cme shock @xcite and was estimated to be @xmath3 hrs .",
    "our current work improves this estimate .",
    "note that for different events the characteristics ( such as the shock speed , the cme width , etc ) of the preceding cmes can vary largely .",
    "the decay time of the turbulence , however , depends on the alfvn wave speed downstream of the first shock , which is decided by the characteristics of the solar wind , not the shock , we therefore expect that the result of @xmath71 hrs is not strongly event dependent .    with the choice of @xmath71 hrs , the percentage of twin cmes in all fast and wide cmes is @xmath65 . in comparison ,",
    "the percentage of twin cmes in large sep events is @xmath64 , which is @xmath72 higher .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 twin cmes lead to large seps while only @xmath63 single cmes lead to large seps .",
    "finally , all large sep events recorded by goes with a peak intensity larger than @xmath67 pfu at @xmath19 mev / nucleon are twin cmes .",
    "these results suggest that the twin - cme scenario can lead to an efficient particle acceleration process and our findings may provide a useful basis for space weather forecasting .    in the twin - cme scenario ,",
    "the role of the preceding cme is to provide the seed population and the enhanced turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is tempting to ask which one is more important , the seed population or the enhanced turbulence ? in a series of papers , @xcite have examined particle acceleration at a shock driven by a single fast cme .",
    "they assumed a quasi - parallel shock configuration and an injection efficiency of @xmath73 and calculated the enhanced upstream alfvn waves and energetic particle spectrum at the same time using a self - consistent approach .",
    "for strong shocks with a compression ratio close to @xmath22 , they found a maximum proton energy reaching @xmath74 mev .",
    "their calculations suggest that , at least at quasi - parallel shocks , strong turbulence can be self - generated if there is enough seed population .",
    "based on these works , the presence of an enhanced seed population at the second shock is probably more important than the presence of an enhanced wave turbulence at the second shock in causing a large sep event . however , we point out that without the enhanced turbulence downstream the first shock , the seed population may quickly convect or diffuse out from the shock region .",
    "we are grateful to soho / lasco , soho / eit , and cdaw , seeds , cactus cme catalogs for making their data available online .",
