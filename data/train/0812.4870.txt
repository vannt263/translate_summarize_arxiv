    "virgo @xcite is a 3-km long arm power - recycled michelson interferometer located near pisa , italy , whose goal is to detect gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted by astrophysical sources extending out past the virgo cluster .",
    "the commissioning of the detector started in 2003 and regular data taking campaigns have been organized after each important milestone .",
    "the last commissioning run ( c7 ) took place in september 2005 and lasted for 5 days .",
    "the best achieved sensitivity was @xmath5 at 300 hz .",
    "the virgo design sensitivity at this frequency is expected to be better by an order of magnitude assuming that 10 w enters into the interferometer . however , during the c7 run , virgo was running with a reduced light power , 0.7 w , because the backscattering in the mode - cleaner cavity of the light reflected by the recycling mirror prevented the control of the interferometer at full power . despite the reduced sensitivity ,",
    "several gw searches have been carried out using this data set in order to set up and tune the pipelines developed in virgo : the search of the coalescence of neutron stars @xcite , the search of continuous wave sources @xcite , a joint virgo , auriga , explorer and nautilus gw search @xcite , a targeted gw burst search associated with the long grb 050915a @xcite , and the search of gw burst signals that is reported in this paper .",
    "the category of gravitational wave bursts includes all possible signals whose duration is short , less than a few hundreds of milliseconds .",
    "many violent astrophysical phenomena will be accompanied by an emission of gw burst . if these events happen sufficiently close by , the ground based gravitational detectors will be able to observe these short duration gw bursts .",
    "there are many candidate gw burst sources .",
    "these include massive star core collapse @xcite , the merging phase of coalescing compact binary systems forming a single black hole ( bh ) @xcite , bh ring - down @xcite , astrophysical engines that generate gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) @xcite , neutron star oscillation modes and instabilities @xcite , or cosmic string cusps and kinks @xcite",
    ". some of these sources are well modeled , but not all , and as such a burst pipeline is built by making very few assumptions about the nature of these waveforms .",
    "the theoretical event rates for many of these sources are quite uncertain .",
    "binary black hole ( bbh ) mergers are an interesting source for gw burst searches .",
    "the typical event rate for these sources is 1 @xmath6 per galaxy @xcite and is still highly uncertain given the lack of direct observational evidence for the existence of bbh systems , unlike the double neutron star systems .",
    "though these sources are routinely searched for by the inspiral phase prior to merger using matched filtering techniques , an independent search focusing on the merger and ring - down gw emission , which is dominant for high mass binaries @xcite , may bring additional confidence .",
    "a search of this type was first attempted with the ligo s2 data  @xcite ; this used the then - available numerical relativity waveforms from the lazarus project as a model of bbh mergers .",
    "however the estimates obtained were projected as order of magnitude estimates due to the nonrobusteness of the waveforms used .",
    "though the burst searches do not have as large of a distance reach as an inspiral search , it will be interesting to understand the implications of a bh binary search from a burst perspective , especially because a burst search is sensitive to the merger and ring - down phase of a bbh coalescence . among the three phases of inspiral , merger and ring - down ,",
    "most of the energy may be released in the highly relativistic phase of merger , that is difficult to model by analytic approximation methods .",
    "but recently numerical relativity simulations have made significant advances in generating the waveforms for all the three phases of the binary evolution ( see @xcite and references there in ) .    in this paper",
    ", we report on an all - sky burst search for un - modeled waveforms and bbh mergers without using any prior information on the expected waveform .",
    "this concerns all short duration ( @xmath7 1 s ) signals having energy in the best sensitivity frequency band of the c7 data , 150 - 2000 hz .",
    "this search has been performed using the data of only one interferometer which does not allow one to perform timing coincidence to eliminate spurious events in one of the detectors , as was done in the burst searches performed using the ligo detectors @xcite and the bar detectors @xcite . however , a similar one - detector burst search has already been carried out with the data from the tama detector @xcite .",
    "the c7 run data has been used for extensive analysis of the virgo noise ; this is a fundamental step in the path toward performing a gw burst search with only one detector . indeed , numerous sources of noise generate , in the interferometer s gw strain amplitude channel , transient events which mimic gw burst events ; environmental noise , such as acoustic noise , has been found at the origin of many of them .",
    "non stationary data can also generate an excess of short duration events .",
    "such phenomena have been found , examined , and understood in the c7 data .",
    "these studies allowed us to define the pre - processing and post - processing steps needed in order to optimize the performance of the gw burst pipeline used in this analysis .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : section2 ] we describe the main features of the virgo detector , emphasizing the operating characteristics during the c7 run that played a role in understanding the quality of the data . in section [ sec : dataset ]",
    "we describe how we select the data periods that have been used for this analysis . the burst pipeline used in this analysis",
    "is described in section [ sec : section3 ] . in section [ sec : dq ] the main results on the c7 data characterization needed in order to understand and to suppress the sources of glitches are summarized ; this includes the veto strategy used against identified sources of noise .",
    "section [ sec : background ] gives the results of the search in the c7 data .",
    "section [ sec : section5 ] explains how the analysis sensitivity has been estimated considering different types of possible gw burst waveforms .",
    "we especially considered in this paper bbh merger and ring - down numerical waveforms @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : section6 ] gives the upper limits obtained at 90% of confidence level on the number of events as a function of the signal strain amplitude .",
    "we finally conclude this paper with an astrophysical interpretation of the present gw burst search .",
    "the virgo detector @xcite is a power recycled michelson interferometer with 3-km long arms that each contain a fabry - perot cavity .",
    "all mirrors are suspended from the so - called superattenuator @xcite , whose goal is to reduce drastically above 10 hz the seismic noise transferred to the instrument . a 20 w nd : yag laser is used to illuminate the interferometer . the laser light is modulated in phase at the frequencies @xmath8 22 and 6mhz ; this technique permits the gw strain to be detected at the modulation frequency where the laser power fluctuation is much smaller than in the interferometer bandwidth .",
    "the beam is spatially filtered with a 144 m long triangular input mode - cleaner cavity before being injected into the main interferometer .",
    "the laser frequency is pre - stabilized in order to acquire the control of the different optical cavities , but to reach the extreme sensitivity targeted by virgo an enhanced control of the laser frequency noise is required ; it has to be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this is the role of the so - called _ second stage frequency stabilization _ which is engaged during the cavities lock acquisition @xcite .",
    "the beam entering the interferometer is divided by the beam splitter ( bs ) into two beams that are injected into the 3-km long arm cavities .",
    "apart from the mirrors losses , all light fed - in by the injection system subsequently returns to it .",
    "the power - recycling ( pr ) mirror , with a reflectivity of 92% , reflects the out - going light back to the main interferometer .",
    "together with the michelson interferometer the power - recycling mirror forms a fabry - perot - like cavity in which the light power is resonantly enhanced , thereby improving the shot noise limit .",
    "the michelson interferometer is held on the dark fringe , and the gw strain signal is expected in the beam at the dark port , which leaves the vacuum via the so - called detection bench .",
    "the detection bench is a suspended table accommodating several optical components .",
    "the beam coming from the bs passes through an output mode - cleaner , a 3.6 cm long rigid cavity .",
    "the main output beam is detected by a pair of ingaas photodiodes .",
    "useful signals are obtained by detecting the light in the transmission of the arm cavities and in reflection of the power - recycling cavity ( b2 photodiode ) . the gw signal that results from a detuning of the carrier resonance in the arms",
    "is extracted from the dark port channel , demodulated , and then sampled at 20 khz .",
    "this signal is digitized and filtered .",
    "the control of the interferometer consists in maintaining the laser light resonant in the optical cavities and the output port tuned on the dark fringe , defining its working point .",
    "more precisely , the carrier must be resonant in all cavities while the sidebands must be resonant in the central cavity but anti - resonant in the arms .",
    "despite the good seismic noise attenuation provided by the superattenuator , feedback controls are mandatory in order to keep the interferometer locked on the right working point .",
    "in addition to the control of the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the cavities , the mirrors must be kept aligned with respect to each other .",
    "this is the so - called auto - alignment control ( aa ) .",
    "if uncontrolled , the angular degrees of freedom of the suspended optics distort the cavity eigen - modes .",
    "this causes power modulation of the light fields ; furthermore , long term drifts will make the longitudinal control impossible after a certain amount of time , and misalignments increase the coupling of other noise sources into the dark port .",
    "this has been a major problem in the c7 data analysis ( see section [ sec : dq ] ) .",
    "in actuality , during c7 not all of the mirrors were under aa control ; the arm input mirrors and the injection bench were only controlled locally .    to convert the signal received on the dark port into a measure of gw strain one needs to calibrate the residual arm - length difference",
    "; this includes at low frequencies the effect of the control loop keeping the cavities in resonance .",
    "the loop correction signals are subtracted from the dark port signal that is then converted into a strain via knowledge of the optical gain of the feedback control loops .",
    "this gain may vary depending , for instance , on the alignment drifts of the optical elements . to monitor the variation , some sinusoidal signals ( four between 100 and 110 hz , and four between 350 and 360 hz ) are applied on the end - arm mirrors and the amplitude of the lines",
    "are measured .",
    "another important aspect of the gw strain reconstruction is the good knowledge of the transfer function of the actuator chain which is used to control the mirrors . actually , during the c7 run , the calibration procedure was not as accurate as it is now .",
    "for instance , the frequency dependence of the digital to analog converter transfer function was not taken into account in the reconstruction of the gw strain amplitude channel @xmath9 .",
    "this yielded a systematic error on @xmath9 which has been estimated to be 40% @xcite .",
    "moreover , during c7 virgo was running with a 700 mw laser beam entering the interferometer in order to avoid instabilities due to the backscattering of light into the mode - cleaner cavity reflected by the recycling mirror .",
    "the problem has since been fixed during a shutdown carried out just after the c7 run .",
    "this reduced power light limited the sensitivity at high frequencies .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] displays and compares the progress achieved on the sensitivity curve since the beginning of the virgo commissioning . at high frequencies ( @xmath10 300 hz ) ,",
    "the sensitivity was limited by the shot noise and the laser frequency noise . at low frequencies ( @xmath11 100 hz ) the longitudinal and angular controls of the mirrors are the main limitation ; the electronic noise of the actuator and/or the sensor introduced by the control loops induce a displacement of the mirror which is well above the fundamental noise floor .",
    "after the lock acquisition is completed , the interferometer state is set to _",
    "science mode_. the science mode duty cycle maintained by virgo during c7 was 66% .",
    "the data was split into 53 data blocks , or segments , spanning over the 5 days .",
    "a minimal duration of 10 minutes has been required for a segment . in order to define the start and end time of the data segments of good quality for the search for burst gw events we considered all the known instrumental effects that influence and spoil the output of the burst pipeline . for example ,",
    "the last 10 seconds of each segment has been removed because many signals , including the gw strain channel , start oscillating and thereby cause the loss of lock .",
    "another problem concerns the excitation of some thermal resonances of the last stage of the suspension ( violin modes ) when attempting to lock the interferometer .",
    "the decay time of these resonances has been determined , and for each segment we suppressed the beginning until the amplitude of the resonance having the longest decay time has been decreased by 90% .",
    "the reduction of the size of the data segments ( hereafter called _ science segments _ ) due to these data quality criteria amounts to 8% .",
    "in addition , some signals have been artificially injected into the gw strain channel during c7 by applying a force on the input mirror of one of the interferometer arm s fabry - perot cavity .",
    "these are the so - called hardware injections .",
    "the hardware injection signals are used in this analysis to test that the vetoes against external sources of noise that were implemented do not suppress any potentially real gw events ( see section [ sec : vetoes ] ) .",
    "the hardware injection periods were not considered for the gw burst search .",
    "taking into account the application of the data quality criteria and the hardware injection periods , the duty cycle is finally reduced from 66% to 55% .",
    "this corresponds to a total duration of 2.51 days .",
    "the gw burst pipeline that has been used in this search is composed of several parts that allow us to select and analyze all segments of virgo data and eliminate , as much as possible , the artifacts in the detector output that could mimic a gw event .",
    "the core of the pipeline is the gw detection statistic , described in section [ sec : pipeline ] , that is applied on pre - selected segments of data of good quality .",
    "this results in lists of triggers .",
    "as we are dealing with non gaussian and non stationary data , many of these triggers are due to instrumental effects .",
    "the next step consists of identifying all the sources of noise disturbances that pollute the detector output , and then define vetoes to be applied a posteriori on the trigger lists .",
    "this step in this pipeline is playing an important role as we can not suppress these artifacts by requesting coincidence with another detector .",
    "we provide details on how the vetoes have been defined and which sources of noise they help in suppressing .",
    "instrumental problems and environmental conditions have been identified that temporarily affect the detector sensitivity for a gw burst search . in a pre - selection step ,",
    "we discard the periods where the detector operation is not optimal . to do so",
    ", we have defined a list of data quality flags ( dq ) that highlight the intervals of malfunctioning . among the dq flags ,",
    "some pertain to the saturation of the photodiodes and/or actuator signals that are used to keep the interferometer locked to its operating point .",
    "the analog electronics of the control loop that maintains the laser frequency noise below the requirements was sometimes also saturating .",
    "that then induces incorrect control signals and consequently a misbehaving gw strain amplitude .",
    "an excess of events was found when the gw strain @xmath9 reconstruction process was facing a problem , for instance when the calibration lines were buried in the noise . when this happens the @xmath9 reconstruction program sets a dq flag stored in the data stream . sometimes during c7",
    "a few frames or channels were missing due to some failure of the data acquisition system . that produces a hole in the continuous time series .",
    "the burst pipelines manage properly with the presence of holes in a segment , but to accurately compute the effective duty cycle we have defined a dq flag pertaining to this issue .",
    "finally , it has been found that when an aircraft is flying above the interferometer at a relatively low altitude acoustic and/or seismic noise couples into the dark fringe beam and induces a strong effect in @xmath9 that is detected by the burst pipelines . the band limited rms of some acoustic probes ( located in the end arm buildings ) were monitored to detect the airplanes .",
    "all these dq segments have been combined into a single list , taking into account possible overlaps . the dead time induced by the application of these dq flags on triggers",
    "list was only 0.8% , of the total duration which is acceptably low .",
    "different pipelines have been developed to search for gw bursts .",
    "many of them @xcite rely on a common principle i.e. , the detection of clusters of excess energy in a time - frequency representation of the data .",
    "the pipeline we use in this analysis follows the same idea ; we refer to it as the exponential gaussian correlator ( egc ) as it been described in @xcite , but here we give here a short summary .",
    "the time - frequency plane can be tiled using a lattice of sine gaussian waveforms i.e. , @xmath12 where the values of the central frequency @xmath13 and typical duration @xmath14 can be chosen in such way as to optimize the coverage of the plane .",
    "the idea is to consider the above waveforms as typical burst transients and to search for them using a matched filtering technique .",
    "for this reason , we designate @xmath15 as a template waveform .",
    "the egc computes the cross - correlation of the data with the templates , namely @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fourier transforms of the data and template , and @xmath19 is the two - sided power spectral density of the noise .",
    "@xmath20 is the normalization factor of the templates defined as @xmath21    for the present analysis , the power spectral density has been estimated over data segments of 600 second duration . to define the template lattice ,",
    "the parameterization using the quality factor @xmath22 instead of the duration @xmath14 is preferred .",
    "using the algorithm of @xcite , we tile the parameter space @xmath23 with a minimal match of 99% .",
    "the parameter ranges 150 hz @xmath24 2 khz and @xmath25 correspond to the frequency band of best sensitivity for virgo during the c7 run .",
    "this generates 420 templates ; the shortest and longest ones have 0.31 ms and 34 ms duration .",
    "the quantity @xmath26 is the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , which we use as a detection statistic .",
    "it depends on the analysis time @xmath27 , the template frequency @xmath13 , and quality factor @xmath28 .",
    "it thus defines a three - dimensional representation map of the data @xcite in which we search for a local excess as compared to typical noise fluctuations .",
    "we first apply a low threshold ( snr of 3.3 ) to the map .",
    "we form clusters with the surviving pixels of energy @xmath29 with a two pass procedure .",
    "the pixels are grouped into clusters using the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite .",
    "once the cluster is formed , all pixels that have a snr lower than 5 are removed .",
    "then , all clusters overlapping in time or separated by less than 50 ms are grouped together once again .",
    "we produce the final list of triggers by requesting that the cluster snr ( @xmath30 ) is larger than 11.3 .",
    "this choice for the threshold is a good compromise between not having too many triggers and not losing too much detection efficiency .",
    "the triggers information is extracted from the clusters .",
    "the peak time , peak frequency and the trigger snr are defined by the pixel that has the highest snr . the duration and the frequency bandwidth of the trigger",
    "take into account all the pixels in the cluster .",
    "the timing resolution of egc has been estimated for different kinds of waveforms @xcite . for most signals used in the benchmark test , the timing resolution of egc is smaller than 1 ms for snr of 10 , but it can be as large as a few ms .",
    "the search for gw burst events presented here was carried out on real data that are non - gaussian and non - stationary .",
    "this prevents the use of theoretical estimates of the expected false alarm rate . on the contrary",
    ", the background rate must be extracted from the data itself . in the multi - detector context",
    ", the background can be estimated by computing the rate of ( purely accidental ) coincidences between trigger lists that were time shifted with random delays @xcite .",
    "we can not resort to such procedure in the case of this study since we only have the virgo c7 data set at our disposal .",
    "there is a need to initially identify , in an thorough way , all the sources of noise that generate large snr triggers that can mimic gw burst events ; these types of noise events have to be suppressed before we try to estimate the background event number .",
    "we define a methodology that guaranties that we do not discard any true gw event as long as they do not coincide with a bad quality data period .",
    "initially , there was the study of all the sources of noise that generate large snr triggers , or more generally an excess of triggers , and the construction of vetoes to suppress these triggers .",
    "the study was performed on a subset of the c7 dataset ( the playground segment ) chosen arbitrarily before starting the gw burst search , in order to avoid bias .",
    "our main concern in the veto development process was to minimize the dead time introduced by the data quality selection , while assuring a high level of noise trigger rejection . to perform the background studies and develop the veto strategy we used the longest c7 science segment",
    "; this segment was 14 hours in duration ( 22% of the whole dataset used for the gw burst search ) .",
    "several transient detection algorithms have been applied to the playground dataset to identify and characterize the sources of noise that generate the high snr triggers that mimic a gw burst event .",
    "mean filter searches for an excess in a moving average computed on whitened data @xcite .",
    "peak correlator is a matched filter using gaussian waveform templates @xcite .",
    "the wavelet detection filter is based on a multi - resolution time - frequency transform applied on whitened data @xcite .",
    "results of these pipelines have been compared to ensure that all sources of transient events have been discovered .",
    "these detection algorithms search for a short duration excess of energy , but using different methods .",
    "all of the trigger lists show a rather large excess of events compared to expectation from gaussian noise ; there was a definite excess of large snr triggers .",
    "two categories of large triggers have been identified ; the first one corresponds to short glitches correlated to a glitch also present in an auxiliary channel .",
    "these auxiliary channels includes the available environmental monitoring and control loop signals ( see section [ sec : glitches ] ) .",
    "the second category of glitches have been found to be due to the so - called `` bursts of bursts '' that we describe in section [ sec : loudest ] .",
    "specific vetoes against these two sorts of glitches have been developed as explained in section [ sec : vetoes ]      to veto all periods of data during which instrumental or environmental problems occurred and generated a glitch in the gw channel data , one first needs to figure out which auxiliary channels are the most sensitive to these particular sources of noise .",
    "the by - eye scanning of the loudest events observed in the playground dataset already gave hints to potentially useful auxiliary channels .",
    "however we subsequently performed a systematic analysis using many channels recorded by virgo and using the mean filter pipeline .",
    "we have found that three channels were particularly interesting for vetoing glitches in the gw strain amplitude channel @xmath9 .",
    "it has been seen that many high snr burst events are coincident in time with the realignment of the quadrant photodiodes by some stepping motors .",
    "these quadrant photodiodes , used for the interferometer automatic alignment system , are located at the output of the interferometer , on the same optical bench hosting the photodiodes used to detect the interferometer dark port signal .",
    "the stepping motors were generating very loud acoustic and mechanical noise that coupled into the dark fringe beam nearby .",
    "each time a quadrant photodiode is moved there is a large increase in the signal measured by an accelerometer probe located on the detection bench .",
    "when the quadrant photodiodes were not re - aligned ( horizontal and vertical positions remain constant ) the rms of the accelerometer probe signal remained low .",
    "the rate of the quadrant photodiodes realignment was not constant over the run ; initially the alignment occurred every 3 seconds , but this was then reduced to every 300 seconds at the end the c7 run after the discovery of the problem ( the parameters of the process responsible for the quadrant photodiodes realignment have subsequently been changed to diminish this problem ) .",
    "this acoustic / mechanical noise generated glitches in the gw strain amplitude channel whose frequency content was around 550 hz . due to the fact that the excess of acoustic noise could last up to 1 second , which is long for a glitch finding algorithm , we used the rms computed over 100 ms of data from an accelerometer located on the detection bench instead of the mean filter triggers to create a veto ( called seismic in the writing below ) .",
    "this allowed a more precise definition of the gps time of the maximum of the excess of noise .",
    "this source of glitches has been found to be dominant in the playground dataset , but other ( and rarer ) types of glitches have also been found in the c7 data .",
    "indeed , events in the second stage frequency stabilization system correction signal were observed in coincidence with @xmath9 glitches .",
    "some remaining loud glitches discovered in the gw strain amplitude channel have been found to be coincident in time with a dip in the power of the beam reflected by the interferometer toward the laser as recorded by the so - called b2 photodiode .",
    "the light impinging on the b2 photodiode is sensitive to the power recycling cavity length change .",
    "the origin of the power dips have not been understood , but the effect on the gw strain amplitude was demonstrated and the safety of this veto using an optical auxiliary channel has been carefully studied , and is discussed below . to define an event by event veto for the two latest categories of glitches we used the mean filter triggers .",
    "these vetoes are hereafter referred to as ssfs and b2.      we noticed that the burst triggers were not uniformly distributed over time but seemed to show up in bunches lasting up to a few seconds .",
    "these events have been called bursts of bursts ( bob ) . fig . [",
    "fig : a_bob ] shows the whitened gw strain channel s amplitude and its spectrogram during a data period that contains a burst of bursts .",
    "the spectrogram shows that the event has a broadband frequency content contrary to most of the events caused by external disturbances .",
    "this broadband spectral signature provided clues that helped to identify the bobs as local increases of the noise level due to an increase of the coupling factor between the frequency noise ( which is only a factor 2 lower than the shot noise at high frequency for c7 ) and the interferometer s dark port channel .",
    "the presence of a peak around t @xmath2 27 s in the correlogram of the burst events ( see fig . [",
    "fig : correlogram_27s ] ) provided evidence that the residual angular motion of the mirrors could be playing a role .",
    "indeed , 27 s corresponds to the period of a mechanical resonance between the two last stages of the virgo suspension that , if excited , may induce mirror angular degrees of freedom motion @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      in the previous section we determined the sensitivity of the c7 data analysis to different potential gw burst sources in terms of @xmath31 .",
    "this can be translated into an astrophysical estimate on the amount of gw energy emitted by a source or the distance reach , depending on the type of sources we consider . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed in our ad - hoc waveform simulations that the emission is isotropic , although this may not be the case for a real astrophysical signal . in the case of a sine gaussian waveform with a central frequency @xmath13 and quality factor @xmath32 ,",
    "one obtains for the gw energy emitted by the source @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ( non - cosmological ) distance to the source .",
    "similarly , for a gaussian waveform , the emitted gw energy is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the width of the gaussian .",
    "the above expressions can be used to derive an astrophysical sensitivity with the present c7 data analysis in different ways . for sources at a fixed distance , an estimate on the emitted gw energy",
    "can be obtained by using the smallest value of @xmath37 .",
    "conversely , if we know the energy emitted in gws , this information can be used to infer the maximum distance up to which such an event could have been observed by virgo with an efficiency larger than 50% . in what follows we discuss these various possibilities , quantifying the detectability of supernova events and bbh merger events where the nature of waveforms and the energy of emission are known through the numerical simulations .",
    "considering the sine gaussian and gaussian waveforms that give the best results in terms of @xmath37 , we can compare the estimation of the maximal gw energy emitted by a hypothetical gw burst source in the vicinity of the galactic center , assuming a distance of 10 kpc . with the 361 hz sine gaussian we obtained @xmath37 of @xmath38 , which translates into an energy of @xmath39 . for a gaussian waveform",
    ", the most favorable case corresponds to @xmath40 ms and @xmath41 ; the associated energy is @xmath42 .",
    "hence the most optimistic limit on the energy differs almost by an order of magnitude between the gaussian and sine gaussian waveforms , while the detection performance in terms of @xmath31 is only two times worse for a gaussian with respect to a sine gaussian .",
    "we now consider the predictions on the gw energy produced by the collapse of a stellar iron core to form a neutron star .",
    "it is assumed that the progenitor star rotates fast enough to generate sufficient deformation .",
    "we do not consider here the gws generated after the core collapse by the development of an oscillation of the proto - neutron star lasting a few hundred of milliseconds @xcite since we did not expand the search for corresponding high q oscillating signals .",
    "a few hundred of milliseconds at a frequency around 700 hz corresponds to a q of a few hundred . using the core collapse waveform a1b2g1 injected into the data to determine the efficiency for that particular signal",
    ", we can derive the distance reach corresponding to 50% of efficiency as we do for the bbh waveforms ; the distance is 0.15 kpc .",
    "however , this waveform might not be representative of the overall core collapse bounce waveforms . indeed , depending on the progenitor model parameters ( mass , rotation rate , equation of state ) the gw energy prediction can vary by several orders of magnitude @xcite : @xmath43 with peak frequency which can be as high as 800 hz . however , these recent simulations @xcite seem to indicate that the waveforms are rather generic regardless of the dynamic of the collapse ( pressure dominated or centrifugal bounce ) . even in the case of centrifugal bounce , the waveforms",
    "exhibit a positive pre - bounce followed by a negative peak , but the typical frequency is lower than in the case of a uniform differential rotation for which the typical frequency is around 700 hz .",
    "for instance , if one considers the model with a 20 @xmath44 progenitor mass , a moderate differential rotation value ( a=1000 km ) and a moderate initial rotation rate ( @xmath45 = 0.5% ) , @xmath46 and the characteristic frequency is 715 hz using the equation of state provided by shen @xcite .",
    "we should not specifically assume that supernova gw signals are monochromatic waveforms like sine gaussians .",
    "they do not look like gaussians either ( they are more localized in frequency than gaussian ) . taking the @xmath37 value for the @xmath36 = 0.5 ms gaussian ( that roughly corresponds to the width of the peak of the considered waveform ) , we obtain a maximal distance range of 0.18 kpc . using the sine gaussian expression , and using the @xmath37 for a central frequency 715 hz",
    "we obtain a distance of 0.12 kpc . for the a1b2g1 waveform used in this paper , and considering a radiated energy of @xmath47 computed using eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite , we obtain a distance of 0.12 kpc whatever the assumption made on the waveform ( gaussian of @xmath36 = .35 ms or a sine gaussian of @xmath13=650 hz ) .",
    "these numbers indicate the order of magnitude of the maximal detection distance we have reached during virgo s c7 run .",
    "this achieved distance is somewhat small , and we expect to gain at least one order of magnitude with virgo data acquired during more recent observation runs .      from the detection efficiency results obtained with the bbh waveforms in section [ sec : deteff ] , one can derive a distance at which egc is able to detect a signal with 50% or 90% efficiency , respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these values have been extracted from the results of the fits of the detection efficiency as a function of the distances for which the bbh sources have been simulated . an asymmetric sigmoid function has been used and the errors on @xmath48 and @xmath49 have been estimated as they have for @xmath37 and @xmath50 .",
    "[ fig : bhbh - distance ] shows the @xmath48 and @xmath49 detection distances as a function of the total mass of the system .",
    "@xmath49 gives an indication of the average distance range up to which this search could have been able to detect a bbh source . with the present choice of threshold on the snr , our search is sensitive to bbh mergers in the mass range 20 @xmath51 - 150 @xmath51 up to a distance of 1 - 3 mpc ( 0.5 - 1mpc ) for 50% ( 90% ) detection efficiency .",
    "the distance reach is maximum for a bbh of total mass 80 - 90 @xmath51 . in the c7 sensitivity band",
    ", this mass range corresponds to signals where the merger part is dominant .",
    "besides , for a mass higher than 100 @xmath51 , the merger frequency ( given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmerger ] ) ) is below the frequency lower bound studied in the analysis ( 150 hz ) .",
    "this fact adds to the degraded c7 run sensitivity below 150 hz , and explains why the distance reach for the high mass waveforms is decreasing .",
    "this bound on the distance can , in principle , be translated into an upper limit on the event rate , assuming a gaussian distribution of bbh masses around 80 @xmath44 .",
    "this analysis would require combining a model for the galaxies , their blue light luminosity distribution as a function of distance and mass , along with the antenna pattern of the detector ; this has been proposed in @xcite for the ligo detectors .",
    "but given the limited volume of the universe that the present search is capable of sampling , we postpone this more complete analysis until we analyze the most recent virgo data with its improved sensitivity .",
    "moreover , the results have been obtained only for non - spinning equal mass binary systems .",
    "an alternative way of deriving the distance reach for bbh mergers is to assume that the merger and ring - down phases of the bbh waveforms resemble sine gaussians and use the results obtained from the sine gaussian waveforms to derive the detection distance . in order to use sine gaussians to model the bbh mergers , we approximate the nr waveforms to be sine gaussians with peak frequency @xmath13 equal to the frequency at the merger ( @xmath52 ) of the nr waveforms using eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmerger ] ) following @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this definition of @xmath52 is only approximate . besides , it is not obvious how to assign a precise value of @xmath53 to the sine gaussian that approximates a bbh waveform .",
    "however , taking into account the typical duration @xmath36 of the `` merger '' part of the waveform and using the relation , exact for a sine gaussian , @xmath54 , one could deduce that the q is between 10 and 20 for the high mass bbh and as large as 40 for the low masses .",
    "this is larger than the boundary of sine gaussian templates bank used in this analysis .",
    "hence , we may suspect that for the low mass ( @xmath55 ) the egc pipeline is not optimally reconstructing the snr of the nr waveforms .",
    "however , it is straightforward to show that @xmath37 , the quantity which is used in the derivation , does not depend on @xmath53 for sine gaussians as long as @xmath53 is sufficiently large ( table [ tab : eff - sg ] confirms this ) .",
    "for all these reasons , in the discussion that follows , we consider a sine gaussian with q @xmath56 9 . in order to determine the distance",
    "reach one should make an assumption on the total energy emitted by the source and on the source emission pattern . according to nr simulations @xcite , @xmath56 3.5% of the total rest mass energy would be radiated away as gws .",
    "following @xcite , we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : egwsg ] ) and the values of @xmath31 in table [ tab : eff - sg ] to derive the distances up to which such bbh merger events could be observed with an efficiency of 50% or 90% .",
    "the results for the distance reach at an efficiency of 90% are presented in fig.[fig : bhbh - distance ] together with the distance reach obtained using nr waveforms at the same detection efficiency . at intermediate masses and frequencies",
    "the distance reach obtained when bbh mergers are modeled with sg waveforms is about 60% larger than the one obtained when more realistic nr waveforms are used .",
    "a detailed comparison of the two waveforms shows that this difference is partly due to the broader spectral distribution of the nr waveform for which part of the signal energy falls out of the detector and analysis bandwidth .",
    "the remaining difference is due to the egc pipeline , which by construction matches more efficiently with the sg waveforms .",
    "in this paper , we have reported on a search for short duration gw bursts in the virgo c7 data from within the 150hz - 2 khz frequency band ; this corresponds to the best sensitivity achieved by virgo during the c7 run .",
    "this search , carried out using the output of only one gw detector , required first the understanding and then the possibility of vetoing all identified sources of noise .",
    "special care has been taken to assure ourselves that the procedure does not suppress a gw event , and that the dead time remains small .",
    "unfortunately , the non stationary data features prevent a search during vetoed time periods , which amounts to an accumulated dead time of 20.2 % . though this rather large dead time limits the astrophysical interest of the search , it has been possible to calculate a sensitivity for various gw burst sources . the best sensitivity that has been reached in terms of the square root of the strain amplitude at 50% of efficiency , @xmath37 , was 1.1 @xmath57 at 361 hz , a frequency region where virgo s sensitivity was optimal .",
    "if one considers the whole set of waveforms studied in this paper , the sensitivity lies between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "however , one should note that the error on the sensitivity can be as large as 40% due to uncertainties in the calibration of the strain amplitude .",
    "those numbers can be compared to gw burst searches carried out with ligo detectors during the s2 data taking in 2003 @xcite . indeed , the c7 virgo sensitivity is comparable to that of 4-km ligo detectors during their s2 run ; virgo during c7 was a little bit more sensitive above 500 hz and a bit less below .",
    "not surprisingly , the search sensitivity obtained with c7 virgo data is similar to ligo s2 results for the same kind of waveforms : @xmath37 having values between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    besides the search of un - modeled gw burst waveforms , we have shown using recently computed numerical relativity waveforms that burst pipelines can be used efficiently to search for bbh merger gw emission . in the case of non - spinning equal mass system , a distance reach of 2.9 mpc for 80 @xmath44 total",
    "mass has been inferred from the c7 data assuming an efficiency of 50% .",
    "this mass range corresponds to when the bh merger part of the signal dominates over the inspiral part . that also corresponds to a frequency region where ground base interferometers achieve their best sensitivity .",
    "it is interesting to note that the sensitivity in the merger dominated frequency range is up by roughly a factor of 10 in the most recent virgo data ( acquired in the later half of 2007 ) .",
    "this would correspond to a distance reach up to 30 mpc ( 12 mpc ) at 50% ( 90% ) efficiency .",
    "this distance reach improvement is not enough to tackle regions where the number of galaxies becomes interesting given the expected bbh event rate .",
    "further upgrades , like advanced virgo , may be needed to have a reasonable probability of detection . despite that , and given the improvement of the virgo sensitivity in the low frequency region , we will expand the egc pipeline parameter space to explore more efficiently from this region .",
    "though matched filtering with a bank of templates , including inspiral , merger and ring - down phases , might have a better detection efficiency for bbh mergers , it is important to complement the search with other techniques not based on tailored matched filtering but using generic templates , such as sine gaussians .",
    "this approach could provide a method that would be more robust at finding increasingly complicated signals that depend on a larger number of astrophysical parameters from the sources , such as a black hole s spin in the case of a black hole - neutron star system .",
    "finally , one should add that the recent virgo data taking ( vsr1 ) will be analyzed in coincidence with ligo s5 data .",
    "that is especially interesting in the high frequency region ( @xmath10 600 hz ) where the sensitivity of the four detectors are all limited by shot noise .",
    "this network of four non - aligned interferometers with comparable sensitivity should be able to detect gw signal emitted by a supernova anywhere in the galaxy .",
    "the authors thank h. dimmelmeier for fruitful discussions and providing the new core collapse waveforms .",
    "we thank the numerical relativity group at nasa goddard space flight center for sharing the results of their binary black hole simulations with us .",
    "we also want to thank b. kelly for valuable discussions about these waveforms .",
