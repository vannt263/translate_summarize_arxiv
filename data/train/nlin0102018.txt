    "the cauchy problem for the korteweg de vries ( kdv ) equation @xmath1 in the zero - dispersion limit has been widely studied .",
    "the physical interest in this limit is due to the fact that it describes the phenomenon of shock waves in dissipationsless dispersive media .",
    "dispersive shock waves are characterized by the appearance of rapid modulated oscillations .",
    "gurevich and pitevskii @xcite suggested that these oscillations could be modeled by the solution of the one - phase whitham equations @xcite .",
    "the multiphase or @xmath2-phase whitham equations were derived by flaschka , forest and mc laughlin @xcite .",
    "lax and levermore @xcite rigorously showed that the multiphase whitham equations appear in the zero dispersion limit of the cauchy problem for the kdv equation with asymptotically reflectionless initial data . later venakides @xcite considered a wider class of initial data .",
    "lax and levermore developed their theory in the frame of the zero - dispersion asymptotics for the solution of the inverse scattering problem of kdv .",
    "they showed that the principal term of the relevant asymptotics is given by the @xmath2-phase solution @xcite of the kdv equation with the wave parameters depending on the functions @xmath3 which satisfy the @xmath2-phase whitham equations : @xmath4 for @xmath5 the speeds @xmath6 , @xmath7 , depend through @xmath8 on complete hyperelliptic integrals of genus @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath9 we define @xmath10 and the zero - phase whitham equation reads @xmath11 and can be integrated by the method of characteristics .",
    "the formal integrability of equations ( [ whithamg ] ) for @xmath5 was obtained by tsarev @xcite using the geometric - hamiltonian structure @xcite of the whitham equations .",
    "namely he proved that if the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 , solve the linear over - determined system of equations @xmath14,\\quad i , j=1,2,\\dots,2g+1,\\;\\;i\\neq j,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , are the speeds in ( [ whithamg ] ) , then the solution @xmath16 of the so called hodograph transformation @xmath17 satisfies equations ( [ whithamg ] ) .",
    "conversely , any solution @xmath18 of ( [ whithamg ] ) can be obtained in this way in the neighborhood of @xmath19 at which @xmath20 s are not vanishing .",
    "the general solution of the tsarev equations was obtained in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite for monotonically increasing initial data .",
    "the key step introduced in @xcite,@xcite was to reduce the solution of the tsarev system to the solution of linear - overdetermined systems of euler - poisson darboux type for some functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 in this paper we show that these functions play a role in the lax - levermore maximization problem .",
    "we study the small dispersion limit of kdv for monotonically increasing analytic initial data bounded at infinity .",
    "we use a different approach to the small dispersion limit obtained in @xcite by deift , venakides and zhou .",
    "these authors first used the formulation of the cauchy problem for kdv as a riemann - hilbert ( rh ) problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "then , for computing the small @xmath24-asymptotics , they used the steepest descent method for oscillatory riemann - hilbert problems introduced in @xcite .",
    "their procedure leads to a scalar rh problem for a certain phase function @xmath0 that turns out to be equivalent to the solution of the leading order variational problem in the lax - levermore theory .",
    "furthermore they reduce the initial value problem for the whitham equations to solving a set of algebraic equations constrained by algebraic inequalities .",
    "existence and uniqueness of the initial value problem for the whitham equations follows from the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the variational problem in the lax - levermore theory .",
    "the rh problem for the scalar function @xmath0 is well defined even for smooth initial data .",
    "we show that , for smooth monotonically increasing initial data bounded at infinity , the function @xmath0 and the lax - levermore maximizer can be expressed as the solution of a linear overdetermined system of euler - poisson - darboux type . in the same way , the set of algebraic equations obtained through the deift , venakides and zhou approach can be expressed as the solution of a set of linear overdetermined systems of equations of euler - poisson darboux type .",
    "we also show that this set of algebraic equations is equivalent to the set of algebraic equations defined by the hodograph transformation ( [ ch00 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of this representation is clear when one tries to construct effectively the solution of the set of algebraic equations constrained by the algebraic inequalities .",
    "it is simpler to evaluate space derivatives and to estimate the sign of the quantities in the inequalities .",
    "indeed this representation was used in @xcite,@xcite to give an upper bound to the genus of the solution of the whitham equations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the definitions of the abelian differentials on riemann surface and the meromorphic analogue of the cauchy kernel .    in section 3",
    "we review the riemann - hilbert steepest descent method for the zero dispersion kdv equation with monotonically increasing initial data .",
    "we determine the scalar function @xmath0 associated to the rh problem and all its properties in section 4 .",
    "we show that the set of algebraic equations that we call moment conditions and normalization conditions are equivalent to the set of algebraic equations defined by the hodograph transformation .    in section 5",
    "we show that the hodograph transformation obtained in sec 4 is equivalent to the classical one provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we then show that the moment conditions , the normalization conditions and the lax - levermore maximizer can be expressed in terms of solutions of linear overdetermined systems of euler - poisson - darboux type .",
    "we also derive in a simple way the equations which determine the phase transitions .",
    "finally in section 6 we summarize the main results and draw our conclusions .",
