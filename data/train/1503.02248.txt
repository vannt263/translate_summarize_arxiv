    "the phenomenology of light flavor pseudoscalar mesons @xmath0 and @xmath1 provides a valuable window on many important nonperturbative features of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "it includes such important aspects as :    * the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which gives rise to the appearance of the multiplet of light pseudoscalar mesons . * the @xmath7 anomaly of strong interactions , which gives mass to the singlet @xmath8 in @xmath9 qcd , even in the chiral limit . *",
    "the explicit @xmath10-flavor symmetry breaking , due to the splitting @xmath11 between the strange and up / down quark masses ( the isospin limit , where @xmath12 and the electromagnetic corrections are neglected , will be assumed all through the article ) . * the @xmath13 expansion of qcd in the limit of large @xmath14 , with @xmath14 the number of colors in qcd .",
    "the interaction between the pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngbs ) @xmath15 from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking can be systematically described through a low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) based on @xmath16 chiral symmetry , namely chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath17pt )  @xcite .",
    "following large@xmath14 arguments  @xcite , this approach was later extended , incorporating the singlet @xmath8 into a @xmath2 @xmath17pt lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "this combination of @xmath17pt and the @xmath13 expansion provides a consistent framework which addresses all the previous issues .",
    "more precisely , in this article we show that this large@xmath14 @xmath17pt framework yields an excellent description of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses from lattice simulations at different light - quark masses  @xcite .",
    "constraints from phenomenological studies of @xmath18 decays  @xcite and kaon mass lattice simulations  @xcite are compatible and easily accommodated in a joint fit .",
    "the problems arise when one tries to also describe lattice simulations for @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite . nevertheless , the issue of these observables in @xmath17pt is known and has been widely discussed in previous bibliography  @xcite .",
    "it constitutes a problem in its own and it is not the central goal of this article .",
    "it is discussed for sake of completeness and to show its impact in a global fit .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons not only attract much attention from the chiral community but they have been also intensively scrutinized in lattice qcd simulations , where enormous progresses have been recently made by different groups  @xcite .",
    "varying the light - quark masses @xmath22 and @xmath23 , both their masses and mixing angles have been extracted in the range 200  mev  @xmath24700  mev .",
    "we will focus on the simulation points with @xmath25  mev in the present work . by observing the dependence of these observables with the light - quark masses we will determine the @xmath17pt low energy constants ( lecs ) and further constrain the theoretical models .",
    "at the practical level we have recast all @xmath22 dependencies in terms of @xmath26 and study the observables as functions of @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattice simulations have not been thoroughly analyzed in the chiral framework yet and it is the central goal of the present work .",
    "however , the numerical uncertainties resulting from our analyses in this work must be taken with a grain of salt as correlations between the different lattice data points and other systematic errors are not considered here .",
    "in addition to lattice qcd , there are also phenomenological studies of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixing , which has been extensively investigated in radiative decays of light - flavor vector resonances @xmath27 and @xmath28 processes  @xcite . in these works , the modern two - mixing - angle scheme for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , which was first advocated in refs .",
    "@xcite , was employed to fit various experimental data .",
    "the common methodology in these works is that the two - mixing - angle pattern for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 is simply adopted to perform the phenomenological discussion and the mixing parameters are then directly determined from data .",
    "this is a bottom - up approach to address the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing problem and it is quite useful for the phenomenological analysis .",
    "contrary to the bottom - up method , it is also very interesting to study the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing from a top - down approach in which one first constructs the relevant @xmath17pt lagrangian and then calculates the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing pattern and parameters in terms of the lecs . in this case",
    ", one can predict the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing parameters once the values of the unknown lecs are given .",
    "the present work belongs to the latter category of top - down approaches .",
    "though the singlet @xmath8 meson , which is the main component of the physical @xmath1 state , is not a pngb due to the strong @xmath7 anomaly , it can be formally introduced into @xmath17pt from the large-@xmath14 point of view .",
    "the argument is that the quark loop induced @xmath7 anomaly , which is responsible for the large mass of the singlet @xmath8 , is @xmath13 suppressed and hence the @xmath8 becomes the ninth pngb in the large @xmath14 limit  @xcite .",
    "based on this argument , the leading - order ( lo ) effective lagrangian for @xmath2 @xmath17pt , which simultaneously includes the pngb octet @xmath29 and the singlet @xmath8 as dynamical fields , was formulated in ref .",
    "later on , a full @xmath30 @xmath2 chiral lagrangian was constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the discussion on the @xmath31 unitary group chiral lagrangian has been very recently completed in ref .",
    "subtle problems about the choice of suitable variables for the higher order @xmath2 @xmath17pt lagrangian in the large @xmath14 framework were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the standard power counting employed in @xmath32 and @xmath10  @xmath17pt in powers of the external momenta and quark masses  @xcite , is not valid any more in @xmath2 @xmath17pt , due to the appearance of the large @xmath8 mass .",
    "however , since the singlet @xmath8 mass squared behaves like @xmath13 in large @xmath14 limit , the @xmath8 mass can be harmonized with the other two expansion parameters if one assigns the same counting to @xmath13 , the squared momenta @xmath33 and the light quark masses @xmath34 . as a result of this , in order to have a systematic power counting , the combined expansions on momentum , light quark masses and @xmath13 are mandatory in @xmath2 @xmath17pt  @xcite .",
    "we will work in this combined expansion in our study and denote it as @xmath35 expansion throughout the paper , where @xmath36 .",
    "this counting rule is different from the one proposed in ref .",

    "in addition , we also simultaneously analyze the @xmath26 dependences of other physical quantities from lattice simulations , such as the axial @xmath38 decay constants and the mass ratio of the strange and up / down quarks , in order to further constrain the @xmath17pt lecs .",

    "the relevant ones in our work read  @xcite @xmath57 with the dimensionless lecs scaling like @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    at nnlo ,",

    "@xcite .    comparing the @xmath2 and @xmath10 theories",
    "one can observe that some terms have been reshuffled in the @xmath35 expansion of the @xmath2 lagrangian .",
    "for example , the @xmath70 terms are nlo in @xmath10 @xmath17pt , but they are now split into nlo and nnlo in the @xmath35 expansion ( see eqs .   and ) .",
    "we have several additional new operators , namely the last one in eq .",

    ", that are absent in the @xmath10 @xmath17pt case . finally , the chiral loops start contributing at nnlo in the @xmath35 expansion , while they appear at nlo in the conventional @xmath10 case .",
    "next we calculate the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing order by order in the @xmath35 expansion . in literature",
    ", there are two bases to address the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing , namely the singlet - octet basis with @xmath8 and @xmath73 , and the quark - flavor basis with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "@xcite , when doing the loop calculations with @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is rather cumbersome to work with the @xmath8 and @xmath73 states .",
    "the reason is that at leading order the lagrangian in eq .   gives the mixing between @xmath8 and @xmath73 , and",
    "the mixing strength is proportional to @xmath79 , which in the @xmath35 expansion is formally counted as the same order as the diagonal terms in the mass matrix for @xmath8 and @xmath73 . as a result",

    "<S> we study the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing up to next - to - next - to - leading - order in @xmath2 chiral perturbation theory in the light of recent lattice simulations and phenomenological inputs . a general treatment for the @xmath0-@xmath1 mixing at higher orders , with the higher - derivative , kinematic and mass mixing terms , is addressed . </S>",
    "<S> the connections between the four mixing parameters in the two - mixing - angle scheme and the low energy constants in the @xmath2 chiral effective theory are provided both for the singlet - octet and the quark - flavor bases . </S>",
    "<S> the axial - vector decay constants of pion and kaon are studied in the same order and confronted with the lattice simulation data as well . </S>",
    "<S> the quark - mass dependences of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are found to be well described at next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , in order to simultaneously describe the lattice data and phenomenological determinations for the properties of light pseudoscalars @xmath6 and @xmath1 , the next - to - next - to - leading order study is essential . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the lattice and phenomenological inputs are well reproduced for reasonable values of low the energy constants , compatible with previous bibliography . </S>"
