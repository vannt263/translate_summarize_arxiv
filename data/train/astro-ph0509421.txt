    "resonant absorption lines observed in the spectra of many astronomical objects provide important diagnostics about the physical and chemical states of the environments in which they originate .",
    "one of the important aims of absorption line studies is determining accurate elemental abundances .",
    "the steps involved in using absorption lines as abundance diagnostics are the following : derive ionic column densities in a way that accounts for an absorber that might be inhomogeneous and/or partially covering the background light source , and convert column density ratios to abundance ratios using ionization corrections . in this paper we are going to discuss the first issue , namely the effect of the spatial distribution of ions on the column densities as derived from the observed absorption lines .",
    "a common implicit assumption made when studying absorption line systems in general is that a compact source , such as a star or a quasar , irradiates a cloud whose internal structures are large compared to the projected size of the continuum source .",
    "however , in the more general case , we must consider the two - dimensional distribution of optical depths , @xmath1 , across the projected area of the emitting source .",
    "the observed residual intensity in an absorption line is then : + @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the two - dimensional intensity distribution , emitted by the source at wavelength @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the total projected area of the source , and @xmath6 is the optical depth distribution across the surface of the continuum emitter . the spatial distribution of the column density per unit wavelength @xmath4 , @xmath7 , is related to @xmath1 by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass of the electron , @xmath10 is the speed of light , @xmath11 is the charge of the electron , and @xmath12 is the oscillator strength of the line .",
    "hereafter , we will always assume dependence on wavelength , though we will not always indicate it , for the sake of not cluttering the equations below .",
    "equation ( 1 ) expresses the most general situation where the observed spectrum is an intensity - weighted average of @xmath13 over the projected area of the emitter .",
    "the residual intensity in an absorption line depends non - trivially on the optical depth distribution @xmath6 .",
    "this paper examines a wide range of possible spatial optical depth distributions , characterized for convenience by three functional forms , to study the effects of the shape of the optical depth distribution on the absorption lines , and conversely , on our ability to use the observed absorption lines as diagnostics of the optical depths and column densities in the absorber .",
    "the ionic column density derived from absorption lines depends on how the absorbing cloud covers the continuum source : hpc ( wampler et al .",
    "1995 ; barlow , sargent , & hamann 1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "1997 ) , or inhomogeneous coverage ( de kool , korista , & arav 2002 ) .",
    "the term _ homogeneous _ as employed in this paper will always refer to the optical depth being constant across all or part of the spatially extended emission source .",
    "we extend the formalism introduced in de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which we will refer to as inhomogeneous partial coverage ( ipc ) , to explore the effects of different variants of inhomogeneous coverage and to compare them with hpc over a wide range of physical conditions . since we do not know what the optical depth distributions are in real absorbers , it is important to consider a range of possibilities and compare their effects on line strengths and derived column densities .",
    "we show how to reparameterize a two - dimensional optical depth distribution to a one - dimensional function in  5 and show that the simple ipc prescriptions we study here provide relatively accurate representations of more complicated distributions .      in the spectra of quasar absorption line systems , for example",
    ", it has been pointed out that doublet ratios sometimes differ from what one would expect from atomic physics ( e.g. , petitjean , rauch , & carswell 1994 ; wampler , chugai , & petitjean 1995 ; barlow et al .",
    "1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "hamann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) provided an explanation of the ratio discrepancy in terms of a hpc model . in this model ,",
    "the absorbing cloud covers only a fraction , @xmath14 , of the continuum source , with the implicit assumption that the coverage fraction for both lines is the same ( e.g. , see ganguly et al .",
    "1999 ; gabel et al .",
    "2002 for situations when this is not the case ) .",
    "the residual intensities in the doublet lines according to this hpc model are a special case of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , normalized to unity in the continuum : @xmath15 for the stronger line , and @xmath16 for the weaker line .",
    "the @xmath14 s and the @xmath17 s are also functions of @xmath4 . given @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at each wavelength across the profile , for a particular doublet , one can solve simultaneously for the coverage fraction , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the oscillator strengths of the strong and weak lines , respectively , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are wavelengths of the line doublet .",
    "ganguly et al . ( 1999 ) gave a general expression for @xmath14 when @xmath25 is not necessarily @xmath26 .",
    "for this special @xmath26 case , such as for @xmath27 , hamann et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and barlow et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that : @xmath28 and the optical depth in the stronger line of the doublet is : @xmath29    the hpc model uncovered additional layers of complexity in dealing with absorption lines .",
    "barlow et al . (",
    "1997 ) found evidence that the coverage fraction can vary with velocity across the absorption profiles .",
    "arav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) discovered an apparent trend between the coverage fraction and the ionization potential of the absorbing ion in the broad absorption line ( bal ) qso pg  0946 + 301 .",
    "another apparent trend was found by hamann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in which stronger lines seem to have higher coverage fractions .",
    "the hpc analysis prompted de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to introduce an inhomogeneous coverage prescription ( the ipc , we give a detailed description below ) .",
    "the important difference between the hpc and ipc is the inhomogeniety of coverage . in the ipc formalism",
    "the absorbing cloud partially , or sometimes completely , covers the continuum source , but inhomogeneously , i.e. at some locations the optical depth is high , while at others it is low or simply absent .",
    "de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) parameterized the spatial distribution of optical depths across the surface of the source as a powerlaw in one dimension",
    ". our study will investigate this powerlaw and other parameterizations , provide extensive comparisons with the hpc analysis over a wide range of optical depths , and use the ipc prescriptions directly to derive optical depths from residual intensities synthesized using eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and develop a formalism to derive properties of the ipc distributions based on the ratios of absorption lines in doublets .",
    "a natural question arises in light of the ipc models : what is the effect of the shape of the optical depth distribution on the ionic column densities one measures from the absorption lines , and how do these column densities compare with those derived under the hpc assumption ? to address these issues , we first show how an arbitrary optical depth distribution determines the residual intensity level in an absorption line ( based on de kool et al . 2002 ) .",
    "consider a two - dimensional continuum source with a intensity , @xmath3 , covered with a cloud with an optical depth distribution @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting residual intensity @xmath30 is given by eq .",
    "if the average emitted intensity is : + @xmath31 then we can define @xmath32 , the fraction of the intensity covered by optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 , as : @xmath34 if the source has uniform brightness , then the fraction of the area covered by optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 is : @xmath35 with these definitions eq .",
    "( 1 ) reduces to , in normalized units ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the maximum and minimum optical depths , respectively , at @xmath4 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can rearrange any two - dimensional optical depth distribution to a one - dimensional distribution ( see  5 ) that preserves the fraction of the source ( intensity or area ) covered at each wavelength .",
    "with all these simplifications , the fraction of the area covered by optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 is @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a normalized spatial coordinate between 0 and 1 .",
    "we consider here three examples for the optical depth distribution . in the first one ,",
    "the optical depth , or equivalently the column density of some ion , follows a powerlaw distribution in the spatial coordinate @xmath42 , as in de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the second parameterization",
    ", the optical depth distribution looks like one quadrant of an ellipse the third parametrization is a gaussian distribution .",
    "these distribution functions represent an extremely wide range of possible optical depth distributions .",
    "the powerlaw and gaussian are different variations on inhomogeneous complete coverage , while the ellipse is similar to hpc but with the inclusion of inhomogeneous _ partial _ coverage ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "it is worth keeping in mind that hpc is a special case of the ipc analysis where the spatial optical depth distribution involves a step function , a fact which leads to the relatively simple equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "our study will go beyond the results presented in de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) not only by investigating the gaussian and ellipse parameterizations , in addition to the powerlaw , but also by presenting a coherent , easy - to - follow formalism to glean information from absorption line data .",
    "the treatment of the powerlaw in this paper will be more general than that in de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , in which @xmath40 was restricted to zero .      with the assumptions taken above , an optical depth described by a powerlaw distribution",
    "is then mathematically expressed as : @xmath43 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the maximum and minimum optical depths , respectively , @xmath44 is the powerlaw index , and @xmath42 is a normalized spatial coordinate between 0 and 1 .",
    "we show examples in figure 1 .",

    "( 10 ) and carry out the integration .",
    "the result is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the complete and incomplete gamma functions , respectively .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , in principle , there exist different values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath44 at every @xmath4 . given a specific optical depth spatial distribution ( eq .",
    "11 ) , eq .",
    "( 14 ) gives the residual intensity at each wavelength across an observed absorption line .",
    "we will refer to the second optical depth spatial distribution as the `` ellipse '' .",
    "it can be expressed mathematically as : @xmath53 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the maximum ( minimum ) optical depths with ( @xmath54 ) being the semi - major axis of the ellipse , while @xmath55 is its the semi - minor axis .",
    "we show in figure 2 examples for three different @xmath55 values . as",
    "before , the optical depths and @xmath55 are , in principle , functions of wavelength .",
    "the ellipse is similar to the hpc model if @xmath56 , with @xmath55 playing a role similar to that of @xmath14 .",
    "the fraction of the area covered by optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 is : @xmath57 where the minus sign only indicates that the optical depth is decreasing with increasing @xmath42 ( see figure 2 ) . with this",
    "we have : @xmath58 following the procedure outlined above , the residual intensity for @xmath56 is : @xmath59 for @xmath60 , we have : @xmath61 where @xmath62 . for the @xmath60 case , @xmath63 ( not @xmath40 ) is the actual minimum optical depth realized in the absorber ( the same also applies for the gaussian distribution below ) .",
    "these integrals will have to be solved numerically at every @xmath4 given @xmath55 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we use a gaussian as a third example of an optical depth distribution : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the standard deviation of the gaussian function ( zombeck 1990 ) .",
    "this functional form can describe cases of a small percentage of the maximum optical depth covering a large fraction of the projected area of the continuum source .",
    "for instance , if @xmath66 and @xmath67 then @xmath68 over @xmath69 the projected area of the emitter .",
    "distributions for three values of @xmath65 are shown in fig .",
    "the covered area is : @xmath70 where the minus sign is merely due to the arbitrary parameterization ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this area fraction corresponds to : @xmath71 using the procedure outlined above , we evaluate the residual intensity : @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that @xmath63 is the minimum optical depth achieved by the this distribution .",
    "given @xmath74 , and @xmath40 , we can numerically compute the integral in eq .",
    "( 23 ) to calculate @xmath30 .",
    "in this section , we compare the ipc models to the hpc case as follows .",
    "we compute the absorption line intensities and spatially averaged optical depths for different values of @xmath40 , @xmath39 and the shape parameters , @xmath44 , @xmath55 , and @xmath65 , for each of the three ipc distribution functions described above .",
    "we use intensities computed for doublets having a @xmath26 optical depth ratio to derive the coverage fraction and optical depth assuming hpc , based on equations @xmath75 in  1 .",
    "the spatially - averaged optical depth , @xmath76 , for the stronger line in the doublet is : @xmath77 for the powerlaw distribution , this quantity is : @xmath78 while for the ellipse ( @xmath56 ) it is : @xmath79 and for @xmath80 : @xmath81 and for the gaussian distribution @xmath82 where `` erf '' is the error function . for the hpc ,",
    "the spatially averaged optical depth is simply : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the same as @xmath85 in eq .",
    "we plot contour levels , assuming different ipc models , of @xmath86 in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 for a set of @xmath44 s , @xmath55 s , and @xmath65 s , with @xmath39 taking values between 0.5 and 15 and @xmath87 .",
    "we do not plot values for @xmath88 because the ipc distributions would describe an opaque slab with complete coverage ( or opaque partial coverage for the @xmath89 ellipse distribution ) .",
    "the result would be nearly saturated absorption troughs , and the method for deriving optical depths from the ratio of these troughs would fail .",
    "notice that a small powerlaw index mimics complete coverage while a large one mimics partial coverage ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for the ellipse and the gaussian distributions the situation with @xmath55 and @xmath65 ,",
    "respectively , is reversed .",
    "( small values of @xmath55 and @xmath65 simulate partial coverage , figs . 2 and 3 ) . a quick glance at figures 4 , 5 , and 6 shows that the column densities implied by the hpc doublet analysis are comparable to the average column densities in the ipc distributions used to synthesize the `` observed '' lines .",
    "notice that , in all cases , the hpc analysis returns precisely the optical depths values of the input ipc distribution when @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , the dashed diagonal line corresponds to the ratio being @xmath91 .",
    "the hpc models also asymptotically approach the ipc case for small values of @xmath44 and large values of @xmath55 and @xmath65 , as is apparent from figures . 1 , 2 , and 3 . in these cases ,",
    "all of the ipc models actually resemble complete homogeneous coverage .",
    "an interesting situation occurs for the ellipse distribution .",
    "when the semi - minor axis is less than 1 , this hpc model becomes very similar to the ipc , especially for @xmath92 ( figs . 2 and 5 ) .",
    "the contours in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 run more or less parallel to the dashed diagonal line .",
    "qualitatively , why do the contours behave the way they do ? to answer this question , choose any ipc model and pick the plot corresponding to some specific @xmath44 , @xmath55 , or @xmath65 , as the case might be . at a particular @xmath39 , as @xmath40 increases the distribution shape ( figs .",
    "@xmath93 ) begins more and more to resemble that of a homogeneously , completely covering cloud for the gaussian and powerlaw distributions , or a homogeneous partial coverage for the ellipse . in either case , in terms of average optical depths , the hpc output is nearly identical to the ipc input , and hence the ratio decreases from its maximum value when @xmath67 to unity as @xmath40 approachs @xmath39 .",
    "this decrease is most rapid for peaked optical depth distributions , and hence the closely spaced contours .",
    "sharply peaked distributions also lead to the largest differences between the ionic column densities in the ipc distribution and those derived under the hpc assumption .",
    "the decrease in ratio is less dramatic for optical depth distributions that more uniformly cover the source , and hence lead to contours that are close to unity , such as all the ellipse clouds , the large @xmath65 gaussians , and the small @xmath44 powerlaws . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the ellipse clouds are always very similar to the hpc .",
    "the hpc results differ most dramatically from the ipc input when the ipc distribution is sharply peaked ( large @xmath44 for the powerlaw or small @xmath65 for the gaussian ) and there is a transition across this distribution from very optically thick ( @xmath94 ) to optically thin ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "for example , the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath67 , and @xmath97 in the powerlaw distribution ( eq .",
    "11 ) lead to a spatially - averaged optical depth of @xmath98 .",
    "also @xmath9924% of the source is covered by regions having @xmath100 .",
    "an hpc analysis applied to the absorption doublets generated by this particular ipc distribution yeilds a @xmath101 , which , as expected , is similar to the @xmath9924% of the source covered by @xmath100 gas in the actual distribution .",
    "the optical depths inferred from the hpc analysis are @xmath102 for lines of sight hitting the absorber , and zero elsewhere , implying a spatially - averaged optical depth of @xmath103 .",
    "we show in figs . 7 , 8 , and 9 the results of similar calculations for the powerlaw , ellipse , and gaussian distributions , respectively .",
    "the horizontal lines are the values of the corresponding @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it is not surprising that @xmath105 in the previous paragraph is less than @xmath106 in the actual powerlaw distribution .",
    "the reason is that the absorption line strength is not sensitive to the exact value of @xmath17 in regions where @xmath17 is already @xmath107 , e.g. , on the right - hand side of fig .",
    "1a . for example , if we keep the same @xmath108 distribution but truncate the peak at @xmath109 or even @xmath110 , we would lower the value of @xmath106 without significantly affecting the absorption line strengths .",
    "similarily , adding material ( to increase the optical depth ) in regions where @xmath17 is already @xmath107 could increase @xmath106 arbitrarily , but there would again be now change in the amount of absorption as registered by the absorption lines .",
    "the hpc analysis is remarkably accurate when applied to optical depth distributions that do not contain sharp spikes , i.e. , having areas with @xmath111 , because the absorption lines themselves are not sensitive to optical depths in the @xmath111 regions . without specific knowledge of the true shape of the optical depth distribution , there is no prospect of using measured absorption lines to estimate the amount of material ( column density ) that might be present in very optically thick regions .",
    "however tighter constraints could be obtained by using , not just doublets with @xmath112 ratios , but multiplets and lines of more / less abundant ions that span a much wider range in @xmath17 .",
    "the ipc models can also be applied to observed absorption line doublets ( or multiplets ) to derive key parameters of the optical depth distribution . to illustrate this",
    ", we use the hpc model , eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) given @xmath14 and @xmath85 , to simulate `` observed '' residual intensities , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in doublet lines whose optical depths are in a @xmath26 ratio . basically ,",
    "we follow the reverse approach of the previous section : we now assume that the doublet created with the hpc model is the `` observed '' and we solve for @xmath39 and @xmath44 , @xmath55 , or @xmath65 .",
    "( we fix @xmath67 , with a little loss of generality , to reduce the number of unknowns in our equations ) . for every functional form of ipc , we get two equations with two unknowns ( see eqs . ( 14 ) , ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , and ( 23 ) ) , which we solve numerically using newton s method ( press et al .",
    "the success of this approach hinges on providing a good initial guess .",
    "we find that trial and error guesses at @xmath39 and the shape parameter , guided by the input hpc values @xmath14 and @xmath84 , lead more quickly to the best solution .",
    "the implementation of newton s method also allowed us to confirm that the solutions arrived at are unique and not local minima which the numerical code converged to by mistake .",
    "the aim behind this exercise is to prove the feasibility of our ipc models in solving simultaneously , just as in the hpc case , for the optical depth and the `` shape '' parameter .",
    "we also note paranthetically that one can arrive back at the hpc input values if one uses the derived ipc parameters to simulate the residual intensities and then apply the hpc doublet analysis .",
    "this shows that the ipc doublet analysis we present in the this section is reliable .",
    "we test our method for a range of hpc parameters that would reveal the representative behavior of the solutions .",
    "table 1 lists combinations of @xmath14 and @xmath84 , used as input , and corresponding derived values of @xmath113 , @xmath44 , @xmath55 , and @xmath65 .",
    "we chose three values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , to span the range from optically thin to optically thick .",
    "the average optical depths are be calculated using eqs .",
    "( 25 ) , ( 26 ) , ( 27 ) , ( 28 ) , and ( 29 ) . for @xmath14 we chose 0.1 , 0.5 , and 0.9 to investigate the effects of the degree of partial coverage on the resulting ipc solutions .",
    "we compare the various quantities in table 1 .",
    "it is interesting to see how very low coverage leads to very large powerlaw indices and large derived values of @xmath39 . for low optical depths with hpc",
    "the resulting maximum optical depth derived under the powerlaw ipc is about a factor of two larger .",
    "but the optically thick case ( @xmath116 ) with low coverage ( @xmath117 ) is much more extreme",
    ". we can understand this behavior because the powerlaw distribution describes complete coverage .",
    "it therefore strains to mimic a partial coverge situation with large @xmath44 values , resulting in a large spike in @xmath108 .",
    "this spike dominates @xmath76 , but it is purely an artifact of the functional form .",
    "it shows that the powerlaw distribution ipc is completely unreliable in this regime .",
    "one can always truncate the maximum optical depth value at some very high value without affecting strength of the resulting absorption lines .",
    "a quick glance at the ellipse solutions , both in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath76 , shows that this ipc model is very similar to hpc ( cf .",
    "previous section ) . on the other hand",
    ", the gaussian distribution behaves like a combination of the the powerlaw , in terms of the peakedness , and the ellipse .",
    "the gaussian , like the powerlaw , is based on complete coverage .",
    "but the rapid decline in the gaussian distribution from the core to the wings ( fig .",
    "3 ) is better able to mimic partial coverage . nonetheless , like the powerlaw case",
    ", optically thick clouds with small coverage fractions can lead to solutions with artificially large spikes in the gaussian @xmath108 .",
    "we see that the derived average optical depths with the powerlaw , ellipse , and gaussian distributions are comparable to the average optical depth used to generate the hpc input , with the exception of the optically thick case @xmath118 .",
    "the doublet analysis provides a shape parameter and @xmath39 .",
    "but we are forced to assume a functional form that substantially affects the results ( table 1 ) . working with multiplets with `` n '' lines , or any combination of `` n '' lines whose",
    "@xmath17 s can be reliably tied together , would provide `` n '' equations and `` n '' unknowns and therefore `` n '' constraints on the two - dimensional optical depth distribution .",
    "such complicated procedure is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we describe in this section a procedure to re - parameterize an arbitrary two - dimenionsional optical depth distribution , @xmath119 , into a one - dimensional function @xmath108 .",
    "we show that the simple functional forms discussed above are relatively successful at representing more realistic and complicated situations .",
    "our starting point is to create an arbitrary 2d optical depth distribution .",
    "this 2d distribution , for the sake of definiteness but with some loss of generality , is the surface made from a collection of 36 overlapping gaussian functions scattered over a plane ( fig .",
    "10 ) . the positions and heights of the gaussian functions are chosen randomly , with numbers between 0 and 1 for the abscissae / ordinates and between 0 and 3 for the heights ( peak optical depths for the individual gaussians ) .",
    "we pick the same gaussian width , @xmath120 , for all the functions so as not to get very narrow or very wide spatial profiles .",
    "the outcome of this process is a 2d optical depth distribution across the surface of an emitter , which we assume to be emitting uniformly .",
    "the maximum optical depth in this distribution is @xmath121 , the minimum optical depth is @xmath122 , and the average is @xmath123 .",
    "we then calculate the fraction of the area covered by optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 .",
    "we divide the surface into a grid of 2d cells and count the number of cells with optical depths between @xmath17 and @xmath33 .",
    "this gives us @xmath124 for our 2d distribution .",
    "it is now straightforward to integrate this function ( recall @xmath125 ) to get the equivalent 1d optical depth distribution @xmath108 .",
    "we show the results in figure .",
    "11 ( solid line ) .    to calculate the residual doublet ( with @xmath112 ratio ) line intensities from such a distribution we numerically substitute @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( 10 ) and evaluate the integral .",
    "this gives us two `` observed '' residual intensities for the doublet lines .",
    "we then apply our hpc and ipc analyses to this `` observed '' doublet to solve for the shape parameters and @xmath39 , putting @xmath67 in the ipc case .",
    "we show the results in table 2 .",
    "the average optical depths calculated with all of the hpc and ipc models are comparable to the average optical depth in the original 2d distribution .",
    "this shows that the relatively simple functional forms we discussed in this paper provide practical representations to describe a complicated optical depth distribution .",
    "we plot the corresponding hpc and ipc optical depth distributions in figure 11 for comparison with the equivalent 1d distribution .",
    "it is easy to see that the powerlaw and gaussian functional forms are the closest to the re - parameterized 1d distribution , which was created from overlapping gaussians .",
    "this re - parameterized 1d function is more sharply peaked than the 1d ipc powerlaw that we derive from the doublet analysis .",
    "this shows that spikes in @xmath108 can arise naturally from `` real '' 2d distributions , even if those distributions are based on a very simple , non - spikey function ( a gaussian ) .",
    "the `` spikeness '' in the 1d re - parameterization ( fig .",
    "11 ) is the result of having few peaks in the 2d distribution ( fig .",
    "understanding the effects of the spatial distribution of ions in an absorbing region is essential to deciphering the physical and chemical states of the absorber .",
    "our investigations of the effects of the spatial distribution of ions in an absorbing region on the derived column densities reveal a number of interesting properties .",
    "so long as an absorbing region is not optically thick we find that the average optical depth of the input distribution , i.e. , the one used to generate the `` observed '' residual intensities in an absorption doublet , will lead to a comparable , to within a factor of less than 1.5 , average optical depth derived from a doublet analysis assuming a different optical depth distribution .",
    "figures 4 , 5 , and 6 along with tables 1 and 2 atest to this . in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 we start with an ipc distribution , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the appropriate shape parameter , and then derive @xmath84 and @xmath14 for the hpc case .",
    "we plot the ratio of the average optical depths , @xmath86 , as contours , whose values are always less than @xmath126 in the part of parameter space we study .",
    "table 1 shows the results of the reverse approach .",
    "we start by simulating an absorption doublet using an hpc distribution as input and use an ipc distribution to calculate the attributes of the absorbing region .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath127 , except in the optically thick regime .",
    "we also should point out that we can get back to the initial hpc parameters from the ipc solutions by following the same approach employed of figures 5 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "this symmetry proves that our ipc doublet analysis method is reliable .",
    "we have extended the work of de kool et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to show how , given a functional form in the ipc analysis , we can use observed lines ( e.g. , doublets ) to infer key parameters about the inhomogeneous optical depth and column density distributions .",
    "we go a step further in  5 ( table 2 ) .",
    "we start with an arbitrary 2d optical depth distribution and calculate the resulting doublet residual intensities , which we then analyze with the hpc and ipc models .",
    "the last column in table 2 shows that the resulting average optical depths are almost identical to the average optical depth of the initial 2d distribution .",
    "all this discussion leads us to an important conclusion : our investigation shows that the spatial distribution of ions has a minimal effect on the computed average column density .",
    "given the fact that spikes could arise from not so exotic 2d distributions ( figs . 10 and 11 ) and that the re - parameterized 1d function is closest to a powerlaw ( fig .",
    "11 ) , we conclude that the ipc powerlaw doublet analysis should yield more representative parameters of the absorbing line region . solving eq .",
    "( 14 ) for a doublet that provides two equations in two unknowns ( @xmath39 , @xmath44 , with @xmath67 ) , is relatively easy . in a future paper",
    "we will apply our methods to observed quasar absorption lines and present the numerical codes that implement our ipc doublet analysis .",

    "<S> we study the dependence of column densities derived from absorption lines on the spatial distribution of the ions in an absorber . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate four varieties of coverage by the absorber of the background source : the familiar homogeneous partial coverage ( hpc ) , and three functional forms that parameterize inhomogeneous coverage : a powerlaw , an ellipse quandrant , and a gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the residual line intensities obtained from our inhomogeneous coverage models and then use these intensities as `` observed '' quantities to compute the optical depth and covering factors assuming hpc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the resulting spatially - averaged optical depths are comparable ( within a factor of @xmath0 ) to the average optical depths of the input distributions , as long as the input distributions do not contain spatially narrow `` spikes . </S>",
    "<S> '' such spikes ( very large optical depths over a small coverage area ) can profoundly affect the average optical depth in the absorber but have little impact on the observed intensities . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the converse approach : we start with hpc as the assumed physical model and then infer the parameters of the inhomogeneous coverage models through a doublet analysis . </S>",
    "<S> again the resulting average optical depths are comparable to the corresponding quantity of the input distribution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we construct a more realistic two - dimensional optical depth distriubution based on a random distribution of absorbing clouds , and we use that to calculate observed intensities . </S>",
    "<S> a doublet analysis applied to those intensities shows all four of our simple analytic functions yield an accurate estimate of the true average optical depth , while the powerlaw yields the best approximation to the intial distribution . </S>"
