    "the combined maxima-1 @xcite , boomerang @xcite , dasi @xcite and cobe / dmr cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite imply that the universe is flat @xcite and that most of the matter in the universe is dark @xcite , i.e. exotic .",
    "these results have been confirmed and improved by the recent wmap @xcite and planck @xcite data . combining the data of these quite precise measurements one finds : @xmath2 ( the more recent planck data yield a slightly different combination @xmath3 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that both the wmap and the plank observations yield essentially the same value of @xmath4 , but they differ in the value of @xmath5 , namely @xmath6 ( wmap ) and @xmath7 ( planck ) .",
    "since any  invisible \" non exotic component can not possibly exceed @xmath8 of the above @xmath9  @xcite , exotic ( non baryonic ) matter is required and there is room for cold dark matter candidates or wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) . + even though there exists firm indirect evidence for a halo of dark matter in galaxies from the observed rotational curves , see e.g. the review @xcite , it is essential to directly detect such matter in order to unravel the nature of the constituents of dark matter . at present there",
    "exist many such candidates : the lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) @xcite , technibaryon @xcite , mirror matter@xcite , kaluza - klein models with universal extra dimensions@xcite etc .",
    "additional theoretical tools are the structure of the nucleus see e.g. @xcite , and the nuclear matrix elements @xcite .    in most calculations the wimp is supposed to be the neutralino or lsp ( lightest supersymmetric particle ) , which is assumed to be primarily a gaugino , usually a bino . models which predict a substantial fraction of higgsino lead to a relatively large spin induced cross section due to the z - exchange .",
    "such models tend to violate the lsp relic abundance constraint and are not favored .",
    "some claims have recently been made , however , to the effect that the wmap relic abundance constraint can be satisfied in the hyperbolic branch of the allowed susy parameter space , even though the neutralino is then primarily a higgsino @xcite .",
    "we will not restrict ourselves in supersymmetry and we will adopt the optimistic view that the detection rates due to the spin may be large enough to be exploited by the experiments , see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such a view is further encouraged by the fact that , unlike the scalar interaction , the axial current allows one to populate excited nuclear states , provided that their energies are sufficiently low so that they are accessible by the low energy lsp , a prospect proposed long time ago @xcite and considered in some detail by ejiri and collaborators @xcite . for a maxwell - boltzmann ( m - b ) velocity distribution the average kinetic energy of the wimp is : t50   [ kinen ] so for sufficiently heavy wimps the average energy may exceed the excitation energy , e.g. of @xmath10kev for the @xmath11 excited state of @xmath12 and 39.6 kev for the first excited @xmath13 of @xmath1xe",
    ". these are nuclei employed as targets in the ongoing dark matte searches . in other words",
    "one can explore the high velocity window , up to the escape velocity of @xmath14 . from a nuclear physics point of view",
    "this transition is not expected to be suppressed , since they appear to be allowed gamow - teller like .",

    "the structure of their ground states has been studied theoretically by a lot of groups .    * the @xmath0 nucleus .",
    "+ this is the most studied case . in this case",
    "we mention again the work of ressel and dean @xcite , the work of engel , pittel and vogel @xcite , vogel and engel @xcite , iachello , krauss and maiano @xcite , nikolaev and klapdor - kleingrothaus @xcite and later by suhonen and collaborators @xcite . in all these calculations for @xmath0i",
    "it appears that the spin matrix element is dominated by its proton component , which in our notation implies that the isoscalar and the isovector components are the same . in these calculations there",
    "appears to be a spread in the spin matrix elements ranging from @xmath15 up to @xmath16 , in the notation of ressel and dean @xcite .",
    "this , of course , implies discrepancies of about a factor of 25 in the event rates .",
    "furthermore in the context of deformed nuclei @xcite for the elastic case one finds : _ 0 ^ 2= _ 1 ^ 2 = _ 0 _ 1=0.164 , [ omegas0 ] which is also smaller than the recent result @xcite , while for the transition to the excited state this model yields : _ 0 ^ 2= _ 1 ^ 2 = _ 0 _ 1=0.312 [ omegas1 ] in yet another calculation @xcite in the case of the a=127 system it is reported that : @xmath17 * realistic calculations in the case of the xe isotopes .",

    "inelastic transitions look like a gammow - teller like , @xmath51 , but , unfortunately , the dominant component of the wave function is not @xmath52 .",
    "so the spin me entering the inelastic component may be suppressed .",
    "the first criterion is to have a large elementary nucleon cross section . on general grounds , which have to do with the transition from the quark level , where particle calculations are involved to the nucleon level",
    ", only the isovector amplitude is important .",
    "there exist particle models that predict such large cross sections .",
    "since , however , the accessible excited states involve targets with large a , the branching ratio to the excited state is going to be significant only if the coherent nucleon cross section happens to be small . there exist particle models that satisfy this criterion .",
    "the wimp spin 3/2 model discussed above @xcite satisfies this criterion . in fact",
    "this wimp is expected to be a majorana fermion , in which case the ( neutron ) coherent event rate vanishes .",
    "another possibility is in supersymmetry in the co - annihilation region @xcite , where the ratio of the spin to coherent nucleon cross section , depending on @xmath53 and the wimp mass , which is in the range 200 - 500 gev , can be as large as @xmath54 . in a region of the model space",

    "transitions to excited states are normally forbidden , except in some odd nuclei that have low lying excited states with @xmath58 kev , because wimp energy is mostly below 150 kev .",
    "then transitions to excited states are possible due to the spin interaction with sd wimps .",
    "possible odd nuclei involved in dm detectors used for wimp searches are the 57.6 kev state in @xmath0i and the 39.6 kev state in @xmath1xe , as given in table [ tab : ej1 ] .",
    "the spin excitations of these states are not favored , because the dominant components of the relevant wave functions are characterized by @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 forbidden transitions .",
