    "the @xmath2he(@xmath10)@xmath0be and @xmath2he(@xmath2he,2p)@xmath11he reactions compete in the proton  proton ( p  p ) chain of solar hydrogen burning .",
    "the ratio of their rates at the temperature of the solar center determines how much the @xmath0be and @xmath1b branches of the p ",
    "p chain contribute to solar hydrogen burning . the @xmath2he(@xmath2he,2p)@xmath11he cross section being comparatively well known @xcite , the predicted flux of solar neutrinos from @xmath0be and @xmath1b decay @xcite depends on the @xmath2he(@xmath10)@xmath0be cross section : the 9% uncertainty in its extrapolation to the solar gamow energy ( 23kev ) obtained in a global analysis @xcite contributes 8% @xcite to the uncertainty in the predicted fluxes for solar @xmath0be and @xmath1b neutrinos , in both cases the major nuclear contribution to the total uncertainty .",
    "the flux of solar @xmath1b neutrinos has been measured in the sno and superkamiokande neutrino detectors @xcite , with a total uncertainty as low as 3.5% @xcite .",

    "* e.g. ) or a dramatically lower @xmath2he(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath0be cross section at relevant energies may explain this discrepancy .",
    "since the cross section of @xmath2he(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath0be reaction is of the order of attobarn at @xmath12 = 23 kev , the cross section data from experiments carried out at higher energies are parameterized by the astrophysical s factor @xmath14 defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the sommerfeld parameter @xcite , and @xmath12 the center of mass energy in kev .",
    "the s factor is then used to extrapolate the data to the low energies of astrophysical interest , and often its extrapolation to zero energy , @xmath9 , is quoted .",
    "the @xmath2he(@xmath3,@xmath4)@xmath0be reaction has a @xmath17 value of 1.586mev @xcite , and at low energy it proceeds via radiative capture into the ground state and the first excited state of @xmath0be ( fig .",
