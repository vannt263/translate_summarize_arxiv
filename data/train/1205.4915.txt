    "furthermore , they reported the annual modulation of the signal events which is expected by the yearly round of the earth .",
    "however the signal parameter regions have been excluded by other late experiments such as xenon 10 , xenon 100 and cdmsii .",
    "the discrepancy have received attentions in astro - particle physics .",
    "isospin violating dark matter is one of proposals to solve the discrepancy by supposing different dark matter - proton coupling @xmath0 and dark matter - neutron coupling @xmath1 [ 2 ] .",

    "the nuclear emulsion has been employed in experiments to detect charged particles , opera project [ 3 ] for recent example .",
    "it is a kind of photographic film , on which charged particles leave tracks .",
    "after development , the tracks become distinguishable on the emulsion layers .",
    "the nuclear emulsion detector has the directional sensitivity since the tracks reflect the arrival direction of dark matter .",
    "therefore , it can examine whether signal tracks come from the direction expected by the orbital motion of the earth .",
    "one of the interesting possibility of the experiment is to test the parameter spaces where other experiments observed the annual modulation signal .",
    "large mass as solid is another merit of the nuclear emulsion .",
    "since solid contains much more number of target nuclei than that of gas detector , good sensitivity can be achieved .",
