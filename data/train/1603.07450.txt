    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor systems offer strong and tunable intrinsic spin - orbit interactions@xcite which have been exploited in recently proposed spintronic devices @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the close relationship between charge and spin dynamics produces strongly modified electronic transport properties which are exhibited in a range of effects including the anomalous hall effect@xcite , the spin hall effect @xcite and weak antilocalization @xcite . in the past",
    ", quantum interference measurements have been proposed as a probe of the spin - orbit interaction in low - dimensional semiconductor heterostructures due to their sensitivity to quantum phases arising from coherent spin precession accompanying ballistic transport @xcite . in particular , the role of adiabatic and non - adiabatic phases in magnetic oscillations @xcite is of high interest due to the fact that oscillatory magnetotransport experiments have provided crucial measurements of the spin - orbit coupling in these systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental and theoretical studies of 2d dirac systems such as graphene and surface states of three - dimensional topological insulators have highlighted the role of the geometric phase in particular in magnetotransport @xcite .    in this work",
    "we derive an expression for the landau level spectrum of a 2d system with spin - orbit interaction via a generalization of the onsager quantization condition@xcite to account for non - trivial spin dynamics .",
    "spin evolution is encoded in the su(2 ) phase representing the total rotation of an initial spin state around a period of cyclotron motion .",
    "this su(2 ) phase is necessary to describe non - adiabatic spin dynamics which is present when the effective magnetic field in momentum space describing the spin - orbit interaction is not sufficiently strong to locally polarize the spin of the particle along the orbit@xcite .",
    "we evaluate the semiclassical spectrum for the cases when the spin - orbit effective magnetic field is simply rotating in momentum space with a single winding number and compare to the exact solutions for a variety of spin - orbit interactions in semiconductor systems , including several cases which have not been previously mentioned in the literature .",
    "in addition , we show that magnetic oscillations and electron spin resonance ( esr ) serve as effective probes of the precessing spin structure of landau level states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we derive the semiclassical quantization condition and a general expression for the landau level spectrum of spin - orbit coupled system , accounting for spin dynamics via a matrix valued phase . in section iii",
    "we discuss magnetic oscillations and derive the expression for the oscillatory density of states in terms of the matrix - valued phase . in section iv we evaluate the level spectrum and eigenstates for a rotating spin - orbit interaction with fixed winding number .",
    "we also calculate exact results for a variety of interactions in @xmath0-type systems and present a comparison of the semiclassical and exact results for these as well as for previously discussed results in @xmath1-type systems.@xcite in section v we discuss esr as a probe of the spin - orbit interaction type and evaluate the esr matrix elements for the cases discussed in section iv . our summary and concluding remarks are presented in section vi .",
    "we consider a 2d electron or hole gas in perpendicular magnetic field , described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the operators of kinetic momentum@xcite ( @xmath4 is the charge of the electron or hole ) and @xmath5 is the effective mass . for electron systems , the pauli matrices @xmath6",
    "act on spin , while for hole systems , @xmath6 acts on the doublet of heavy hole states@xcite .",
    "the spin - dependent interaction @xmath7 , accounting for the spin - orbit interaction in addition to zeeman coupling to the external magnetic field , will be expressed in terms of the effective magnetic field in momentum space , @xmath8 .",
    "since the kinetic momenta satisfy a commutation relation @xmath9 = i e b_z$ ] , we may construct annihilation and creation operators @xmath10 with @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sign of the charge , with the corresponding number operator @xmath13 it is possible to diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) in the number representation , as has been done in previous approaches to the problem@xcite .",
    "we consider however the semiclassical picture , in which the spectrum is related to the dynamics of wavepackets moving along the cyclotron trajectory . due to the spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "a wavepacket in some initial polarization state will precess along the orbit , and generally undergo a rotation after a complete revolution , which is described by an su(2 ) matrix .",
    "thus for the purposes of semiclassical quantization the phase is matrix - valued , and the spectrum will be determined by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix - valued phase . in order to rigorously derive this result , we introduce the spinor wavefunction @xmath14 which varies along the angle @xmath15 in momentum space .",
    "explicitly , this is given by @xmath16 where the states @xmath17 are related to number eigenstates via@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 are eigenstates of the number operator .",

    "the basis states @xmath17 are eigenstates of the operators @xmath21 which are related to the momentum operators via @xmath22    note that the number operator corresponds to the classical action coordinate , while @xmath15 is simply the angle in momentum space , @xmath23 .",
    "thus in the semiclassical limit the wavefunction @xmath14 represents the motion of a particle in momentum space as a function of the angle @xmath15 .    in order to obtain the schrdinger equation for @xmath14 then obtained from the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) , we note that the classical coordinates @xmath24 are canonically conjugate , which implies that the operator @xmath25 takes the form of a derivative operator in the @xmath15 representation . explicitly acting on the basis ( [ basis ] ) with @xmath26 shows that @xmath27 thus the first term in ( [ hamil ] ) may be replaced with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the cyclotron frequency , and the effective magnetic field may be regarded as a function of the coordinates @xmath30 .",

    "( this is simply the wavefunction of the harmonic oscillator in the phase representation.@xcite ) single valuedness of the wavefunction then requires @xmath38 to be an integer , which of course yields the usual landau level spectrum @xmath39 .",
    "however , @xmath38 is also related to the average momentum of the orbit via @xmath40 thus single valuedness of the wavefunction in the @xmath15-representation is equivalent to onsager s quantiztion rule@xcite , that the area of the momentum space orbit must be quantized : @xmath41    in the presence of spin - orbit coupling the spinor @xmath14 generally precesses as a function of @xmath15 under the influence of the effective magnetic @xmath42 . in the semiclassical rgime ,",
    "@xmath43 the wavefunction takes the form of a born - oppenheimer product of orbital and spin factors , @xmath44 the first factor in ( [ bornoppenheimer ] ) corresponds to an orbital trajectory in momentum space with radius @xmath45 ( and we assume @xmath46 ) .",
    "when @xmath47 is slowly varying compared to the orbital factor , we may replace the action of the derivative with the semiclassical variable @xmath38 in @xmath48 .",
    "this requires that the spin - orbit effective magnetic field be much smaller than the total energy , @xmath49 , as well as @xmath50 .",

    "since @xmath61 is an su(2 ) matrix , its eigenvalues @xmath65 are complex conjugate , and the phase accumulated due to unitary transformations of spin over a complete orbit for an initial spin state @xmath66 is equal to @xmath67 .",

    "nevertheless , the quantization condition ( [ quantization ] ) does not fix @xmath38 and @xmath53 individually , but only the combination @xmath71 , with @xmath53 being a free parameter corresponding to an arbitrary choice of the phase of @xmath72 .",
    "the choice of @xmath53 is fixed by the requirement for the validity of the born - oppenheimer approximation , @xmath73 .",
    "this requires @xmath74 .",

    "there exist two orbits , whose radii in momentum space are given by ( from ( [ delta ] ) ) @xmath82 and may be determined _",
    "e.g. _ from magnetic focusing.@xcite the periods of the two spin trajectories are given by the derivative of the action with respect to the energy , @xmath83 regarding @xmath84 as a continuous variable in the semiclassical limit .",
    "while we have performed a detailed derivation in the case of a quadratic dispersion , it is intuitively clear that our argument and results may be rigorously generalized to the case of non - quadratic dispersions , @xmath85 . in this case",

    "nevertheless , eq . ( [ env ] ) demonstrates that the berry phase should appear as a correction to the phase of the resistivity oscillations , typically of order @xmath115 for strong spin - orbit interaction , which may significantly alter the amplitude of the oscillating resistivity . in the case of a strong rashba interaction ,",
