    "one of the goals in studies of photo- and electroproduction of pions or kaons on the proton is the extraction of information on baryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "this is usually done on the basis of models built on effective lagrangians  @xcite .",
    "a typical amplitude , describing meson photoproduction , includes the born contribution as a kind of background to be added to the resonance contributions . only at low photon energies",
    "the physics is determined by the born diagrams . with increasing photon energy the born contribution rises to produce unrealistically large cross sections at energies of interest for strangeness production as noticed by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the popular strategy is to suppress the born amplitude by including form factors ( ff s ) in the strong - interaction vertices .",
    "these ff s account for physics on the scales beyond what is considered , _",
    "i.e. _ exchanges of heavier mesons which are truncated from the lagrangian and ( higher order ) loop corrections which are omitted for simplicity . closely associated with ff s are additional terms , called contact terms ( sometimes 4-point vertices or internal contributions ) , which restore gauge invariance ( gi ) usually violated by the introduction of ff s .",
    "several different prescriptions for the ff s and contact terms are commonly in use . while at low energies these prescriptions lead to relatively close results , at higher energies the calculated cross sections may differ drastically . therefore the information on the properties of resonances extracted from these processes is strongly influenced by uncertainties in the treatment of this problem  @xcite .    in the present work we study two commonly used procedures : ohta s minimal - substitution method  @xcite and davidson - workman s ( dw ) recipe  @xcite .",
    "the most essential difference in predictions of these two methods for the meson photoproduction processes , such as @xmath1 or @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , is the modification of one particular invariant amplitude , @xmath4 .",
    "this amplitude is related to the electric part of the amplitude and originates from the convection current of the charged particles involved in the reaction .",
    "its contribution to the matrix element , being proportional to the momenta of particles , affects the cross section at high energies . in the approach of ohta @xmath4",
    "is not altered , due to the complete cancellation between the effects of ff s and the contact terms . in other methods , in particular in dw  @xcite , or haberzettl",
    "s approach  @xcite , the amplitude @xmath4 changes considerably compared to the born amplitude .    in order to study different phenomenological approaches",
    "we calculate vertex corrections and internal contributions to the electric amplitude in an effective lagrangian model .",
    "irreducible one - loop contributions are included for the reaction @xmath5 .",
    "this allows us to extract , within a gauge - invariant model , both the ff s ( associated with 3-point loop corrections ) and the contact terms ( associated with 4-point loop corrections ) , and to make a comparison with phenomenological approaches .",
    "the model is @xmath6 symmetrical and describes the baryon - meson interaction as well as the meson - meson interaction of the scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons . in the intermediate states of the diagrams we include the scalar meson , kaon , proton and lambda - hyperon .",
    "the pion and sigma - hyperon are not included as yet , and thus the model can be considered as semi - realistic . on the one - loop level there",
    "appear three diagrams for the @xmath7 vertex and four diagrams for the internal amplitude .",
    "the vertex corrections have the property that in the limit of large mass of the scalar meson each of the three vertex - correction diagrams generates ffs , which depend exclusively on one of the mandelstam variables @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "this in turn leads to an interesting effect of cancellation between the vertex corrections and the 4-point diagrams in the scalar amplitude @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig:5]a depends exclusively on the nucleon momentum @xmath181 and does not depend on the kaon ( @xmath39 ) and lambda ( @xmath182 ) momenta .",

    "[ fig:5]b .",
    "each of them is not zero , however they have opposite signs and cancel each other in @xmath68 when @xmath205 . more formally , this result follows from the fact that diagrams 21 and 22 describe a correction @xmath206 to the em vertex of the neutral lambda - hyperon , which is transverse , @xmath207 , and independent of the momenta @xmath181 of the proton and @xmath39 of the kaon .",

    "[ fig:6 ] that , when only the diagrams 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] are included , the ff @xmath216 differs considerably from unity .",
    "this means that the correction to the 3-point vertex does not vanish in the limit @xmath217 and yields the @xmath45-dependence of the vertex . in this limit",
    "the diagram should not contribute to the @xmath9-channel ff and indeed one finds that @xmath218 ( not shown ) . at the same time the amplitude @xmath183 approaches the born term at large @xmath117-mass indicating the cancellation of all corrections as discussed above .",
    "it appears also that the corrections are small even at moderate @xmath219 .",
    "this is just a consequence of the fact that the coupling constants which enter this diagram are small .    if only the diagrams 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] are switched on , the @xmath9-dependence of the @xmath220 vertex is generated at all values of @xmath219 ( see the lower part of fig .  [ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "nonetheless the correction to the born amplitude decreases fast and is practically negligible at @xmath219 about 3 - 4 gev .",
    "it is also interesting to note that at @xmath221 gev the total correction is maximal .",
    "this reflects non - regular behavior of the 4-point loop diagram as a function of invariant energy ( cusp structure due to nucleon - sigma intermediate state ) .     and",

    "[ subsec : loops ] , in the calculation of the electric amplitude @xmath183 .",
    "we can conclude that in a microscopic model , where the 3-point vertex has a particular structure which generates off - shell dependence only on a single momentum ( corresponding to the limit where one of the particles in the loops is very heavy ) , different corrections to the born amplitude cancel and the procedure of ohta  @xcite is justified .    in more realistic models , in which light mesons are present in the loops , the corrections do not cancel and the dw procedure may be more appropriate . to test this assumption we calculated @xmath228 in eq.([eq:14 ] ) with the microscopic ff s shown in fig .  [ fig:3 ] , instead of phenomenological ff s used in the original formulation",
    "( one may argue however that only the phenomenological ff s are to be used in the dw approach ) .",
    "it turns out that at small @xmath229 the correction @xmath228 is of the same sign and similar magnitude as @xmath230 , however results disagree in the conditions where one is close to a threshold for the production of the physical particles included in the loop diagrams . while @xmath230 is a flat and smooth background ( see , for example , the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig:4 ] )",
    ", the dw calculation shows an irregular behavior reflecting the cusps in @xmath231 .",
    "the above observations may support the picture in which the dw approach is applicable in the regime where loop corrections arise due to the light intermediate particles , while the method of ohta is applicable in the other extreme .",
    "the precise magnitude of the loop corrections depends of course on the detailed structure of the model . in the present semi - realistic calculation , where pions and sigma - hyperons are not taken into account ,",
    "the corrections tend to enhance the born amplitude .",
    "this situation may however be reversed if all possible intermediate states are included .",
    "finally we should mention that the diagrams similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , where @xmath232-meson replaces the @xmath117 , have also been included in the calculation .",
    "the effect of these turns out to be very small and can be discarded .",
    "in the present work we have explicitly calculated loop corrections to the strong @xmath7 vertex and the additional 4-point amplitude in an effective lagrangian model for photo - induced @xmath233 production off the proton . the main focus has been on the scalar amplitude @xmath171 , associated with the electric contribution in a gauge - invariant approach .",
    "the calculation shows that there is a strong cancellation in the amplitude @xmath145 between 3-point loop corrections , often parameterized via form factors in a phenomenological approach , and 4-point loop corrections , often written as contact terms restoring gauge invariance .",
    "this cancellation becomes complete if one of the intermediate particles in the diagrams becomes infinitely heavy .",
    "this shows that the result of the minimal - substitution method of ohta  @xcite can be understood in the microscopic picture as a particular limiting case .    in a more realistic case",
    "the cancellation is not complete .",
    "only part of the loop corrections can be absorbed in an appropriately chosen form factors and contact terms , constructed using the minimal substitution .",
    "the remaining part can be accounted through 4-point contact terms which are gauge invariant and free of the poles , as was done in the work of dw  @xcite .",
    "the calculation also indicates that the form factors , usually taken in phenomenological approaches , may not be realistic . in a microscopic model",
    "the form factors are necessarily complex , with cusp structures in the real part reflecting the possibility that the intermediate states become physical particles for certain kinematical conditions .",
    "even though we have focussed our attention in this calculation on the electric current , we expect that the conclusion about the complex structure of the form factors is more general and applies to any vertex , which accounts for loop corrections not explicitly included in the present model .",
    "non - trivial structures of the form factors extracted from a microscopic calculation were also observed in ref .",
    "however the cancellation of different contributions which was observed in the calculation of the @xmath183 term may , due to the current conservation , be a peculiarity of the electric amplitude .    in the present calculation",
    "only the scalar mesons , proton , kaon and lambda - hyperon have been included in the loop diagrams . in particular contributions involving the @xmath124-baryon and the pion have not been considered .",
    "qualitatively one expects these particles to give similar contribution ( in absolute magnitude and structure , but sign may be different ) to what has been calculated in this work .",
    "clearly a more complete calculation , where all possible intermediate states are taken into account , is needed to adequately describe the non - resonant part of the @xmath234 amplitude .",
