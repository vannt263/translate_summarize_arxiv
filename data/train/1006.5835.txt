    "the heaps problem was first considered , in independent works , by tsetlin @xcite and mccabe @xcite .",
    "its basic description can be given as follows .",
    "consider a collection of @xmath0 items stored into a list or heap and each of them is identified by a label .",
    "hence , the objects can be described by the set @xmath1 .",
    "the probability that the @xmath2th item is requested by a user is denoted by @xmath3 , for @xmath4 .",
    "hence @xmath5 , for any @xmath2 , and @xmath6 . at each unit of time ,",
    "an item is requested and it is searched for through the heap , starting at the top .",
    "once it is found , it is moved to the top of the heap .",
    "the search cost is the position of the requested item in the heap or , equivalently , the number of items to be removed from the heap in order to find the requested one . in this setting",
    ", it might be of interest to determine the distribution of the search cost when the underlying markov chain is at equilibrium .",
    "+ kingman @xcite first studied the case of random request probabilities , or random popularities .",
    "his paper develops two important cases where request probabilities are defined in terms of : ( a ) the normalized increments of a @xmath7-stable subordinator ; ( b ) the dirichlet distribution on the simplex .",
    "the results contained therein provide an exact analytic evaluation of the expected search cost either for any finite @xmath0 or in the limit , as the number of items @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "in particular , in the case of normalized @xmath7-stable request probabilities , it is found that the limiting expected search cost is finite if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "+ these results have been recently extended in two independent papers . in @xcite lijoi and",
    "prnster studied the case of request probabilities derived from a normalized random measures with independent increments , which generalizes the result obtained by kingman @xcite . in @xcite barrera and",
    "paroissin studied the case of request probabilities based on exchangeable random partitions . + it is to be emphasized that all previous contributions on the subject is confined to the determination of the first moment of the stationary search cost . here",
    "we wish to extend earlier work and determine the expression of the limiting moments of any order in the @xmath7stable case .",
    "in particular , it will be shown that the @xmath9th moment exists if and only if @xmath10 which reduces to the condition provided by @xcite when @xmath11 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "2 we provide a concise introduction to some basic tools and notions that will be relevant for achieving the main result in section  3 .",
    "before stating and proving our result , it might be worth recalling the main ingredients that define the model we are going to use . as mentioned in the previous section , the request probabilities @xmath3 , for @xmath4",
    ", are going to be random . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath12 is a sequence of positive independent random variables and @xmath13 , one can define @xmath14 hence , @xmath15 is an exchangeable random partition of the unit interval .",
    "a possible choice is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18\\}$ ] is a subordinator that is a process with almost surely increasing paths and with independents increments . in this case",
    ", one can express the the laplace transform of @xmath19 in terms of the lvy intensity @xmath20 of @xmath21 .",
    "in other words @xmath22=\\exp\\left\\{-(t_i - t_{i-1})\\int_0^\\infty\\left[1-{\\mathrm{e}}^{-sy}\\right]\\ , \\nu({\\mathrm{d}}y)\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath20 such that @xmath23 .",
    "according to the terminology set forth in @xcite , @xmath15 defines a normalized random measure with independent increments ( nrmi ) .",
    "+ lijoi and prnster in @xcite considered this general construction to determine an expression of the expected value of the search cost @xmath24 . in the special case where @xmath25 they recovered an expression of the limiting expected search cost , as @xmath0 tends to infinity , thus recovering a result proved by @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath20 is as in , then @xmath26 for any @xmath27 .",
    "+ barrera and paroissin @xcite have been able to determine an integral representation for the laplace transform @xmath28 of the search cost @xmath24 in terms of the laplace transforms @xmath29 of the single random weights @xmath19 . in doing",
    "so they rely on results proved by fill and holst @xcite .",
    "the expression they obtain is , then , used to derive a formula for the first two moments . from these formulas , they get an asymptotic equivalent for the laplace transform of @xmath24 and the limit of the two first moments .",
    "only this last point needs the assumption that the expectation of @xmath24 is finite .",
    "two examples are studied : the case of deterministic weight and the case of gamma weight , which corresponds to the dirichlet partition .",
    "notice that , for this case , some limiting results were proved with an alternative way in @xcite . the limiting distribution has been also derived in the general iid case provided that the expectation @xmath30 of @xmath19 is finite @xcite .",
    "+ in the following section we will undertake the approach developed in @xcite and determine the @xmath9th moment of @xmath24 by working directly on @xmath28 .",
    "the main tool we are relying on for the evaluation of @xmath31 $ ] is the laplace transform of @xmath24 as displayed in theorem  2.2 of @xcite and recalled here below .",
    "using , we are able to compute moments of any order of the search cost @xmath24 . before",
    "doing so we need to introduce the quantity @xmath36\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] whose values , at @xmath37 , will determine the moments of @xmath24 .    [ crucial ] if the @xmath15 are determined by normalizing the increments of a @xmath7-stable subordinator with @xmath38 in for each @xmath39 , then @xmath40 \\infty & \\:\\:\\:{\\mbox{\\rm otherwise } } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the @xmath9th ascending factorial of @xmath42 .",
    "note first that @xmath43 for any @xmath27 .",
    "moreover @xmath44 taking into account the form of @xmath29 in the @xmath7stable case , one has @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "summing up , in the @xmath7stable case one has @xmath48 the change of variable @xmath49 yields @xmath50 using formulae ( 3.381.6 ) and ( 7.621.3 ) in @xcite , one finds out that @xmath51 since the gauss hypergeometric function @xmath52 can be rewritten as @xmath53 the expression of @xmath54 can be further simplified as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 a simple change of variable @xmath57 leads to write @xmath58 as @xmath59 and , consequently , @xmath60 if one resorts to identity ( 0.154.6 ) in @xcite , it follows that @xmath61 finally , using formula ( 0.154.5 ) in @xcite one has @xmath62\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as @xmath63 . if @xmath64 then @xmath65 .",
    "otherwise the gauss hypergeometric function diverges ( see paragraph 9.102 in @xcite ) .",
    "after some little algebra the results is proved .",
    "@xmath66    the study of the limiting behavior of @xmath54 is crucial for understanding the limiting behavior of the moments .",
    "indeed , @xmath67 in particular , we have : @xmath68 in general @xmath69 where @xmath70 the last recursion follows from the fact that @xmath71 from proposition [ crucial ] and equation ( [ allmoments ] ) , we have the following theorem ."
