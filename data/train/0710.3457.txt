    "quantum one - dimensional ( 1d ) spin systems have been studied in various aspects , especially with interest on their strong quantum fluctuations due to the low dimensionality .",
    "there appear a variety of quantum disordered ground states where the continuous spin rotation symmetry is not broken and the lowest spin excitation has a finite gap ( spin - gap ) .",
    "these quantum disordered states have no analogues in classical spin systems .",
    "typical examples are a haldane state in a spin-1 chain  @xcite , a dimer state in a spin-@xmath1 chain with bond alternation  @xcite , and a spin - gap state in a spin-@xmath1 ladder  @xcite .    in extensive research for various 1d spin systems , spin chains with side chains",
    "have not attracted enough attention in spite of its potentially rich physics .",
    "since a side chain is of finite length , it may enhance quantum fluctuation in the system .",
    "actually , the 1d kondo necklace model , which has been extensively studied as a simplified version of 1d kondo lattice model  @xcite , can be regarded as a spin chain with side chains . in this model ,",
    "the main chain is a spin-@xmath1 chain and each side chain consists of a single spin with magnitude @xmath1 .",
    "the ground state of this model is known to be in the kondo singlet phase with spin - gap  @xcite , while the spin-@xmath1 chain without side chains is critical .",
    "this means that the quasi - long range order in the main chain is destroyed by the quantum fluctuation in the side chains .",
    "also , if the side chains bring geometrical frustration into the system , quantum fluctuation is expected to be further enhanced .",
    "thus , it is an interesting subject how quantum fluctuation manifests itself and what kind of ground state appears in various types of spin chains with side chains .    in this paper , we investigate the natures of quantum disordered ground states of one of the simplest models with frustrated side chains .",
    "the main chain of the model consists of two species of spins in alternating order , and each side chain consists of a single spin which are alternately attached to the main chain , as will be shown in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] of the next section .",
    "this model incorporates the effects of mixture of different spins , bond alternation , and frustration in spite of its simplicity .",
    "in particular , the frustration comes from triangles , each consisting of antiferromagnetically interacting three spins .",
    "although quantum spin systems with similar geometry have been investigated by several authors  @xcite , our model is physically different from them . if the side chains of our model are removed , the main chain is in a ferrimagnetic ground state .",
    "the side chain spins introduce frustration to the system , and destroy the ferrimagnetic order leading to quantum disordered states .    ,",

    "the case that @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is studied particularly in detail . ]    the disordered ground states of the present model can not be understood in the conventional valence bond solid ( vbs ) picture  @xcite , which successfully explains the disordered ground states of many spin models with local frustration .",
    "instead , we will explain the present ground states in the concept of the singlet cluster solid ( scs ) picture .",
    "a scs state is a direct product of local singlet states , or singlet clusters .",
    "each singlet cluster consists of more than two singlet dimers , and the dimers are resonating locally within the cluster .",
    "the scs states are realized as a result of the interplay of quantum fluctuation and local frustration , as will be explained in detail .",
    "it is desirable that the scs state manifested in this paper is experimentally inspected in materials .",
    "however , a material precisely described by the present model is not found so far within our knowledge . despite the lack of materials",
    ", it is worth clarifying the concept of the scs states and verifying the existence of them in a concrete model .",
    "further , considering the rich variety of magnetic materials synthesized by the modern chemical technology @xcite , desired materials are expected to be synthesized , since they are not necessarily complex in structure .",
    "the details of the model are explained in the next section .",
    "various approaches are employed to clarify the ground state phases of this model : in section [ sec : nlsm ] , a nonlinear @xmath0 model ( nlsm ) method is proposed to grasp qualitative feature of the phase diagram . since a similar nlsm method has been developed for mixed spin chains without side chains so far , we extend it to the present side - chain case .",
    "we also employ other approaches limiting ourselves to the simplest case of spin magnitudes 1 and @xmath1 . in section [ sec : num_diagonal ] , the numerical diagonalization for finite systems is carried out to obtain the quantitatively reliable phase diagram , which confirms the qualitative correctness of the nlsm method .",
    "some limiting cases are exactly treated to draw physical picture for each phase in section [ sec : limit ] .",
    "after these considerations , we arrive at the scs pictures to explain the ground states in section [ sec : scs ] .",
    "the scs pictures are also supported by variational calculations in section [ sec : variational ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
