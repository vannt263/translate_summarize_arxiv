    "quantum dot ( qd ) systems have been providing opportunities to probe a wide variety of many - body effects of electronic transport properties in microelectronic structures .",
    "the kondo effect , one of the main characteristics of these systems , is a result of quantum correlation between localized spin in qd and free electrons in electrodes@xcite .",
    "recently , the fano effect , which appears as a result of quantum interference between a discrete single energy level and a major electronic system , has also attracted the interests of many microelectronics researches .",
    "typically , a dip structure can be observed in conductance plotted as a function of an energy level of a side qd@xcite .",
    "a t - shaped qd system consists of two qds , in which the first qd is connected to a source and a drain and the second qd is set beside the first qd .",
    "this system is well suited to investigation of both the fano effect and kondo effect ( fano - kondo effect ) and has been theoretically analyzed by many authors@xcite .",
    "there are a variety of parameter settings in a t - shaped qd system .",
    "_ assume that there is an infinite on - site coulomb interaction in the first qd ( hereafter we call it ` detector qd ' ) , and no interaction in the second side - qd@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , gcl _ et al . _ assumes an infinite on - site coulomb interaction in the second side - qd and no interaction in the detector - qd@xcite . in the former case , kondo peak is dominant , whereas in the latter case , fano dip structure is dominant in the transport properties of such a system .",
    "_ assume infinite on - site coulomb interactions in both the detector - qd and the side - qd , showing that fano dip structure appears in the middle of kondo resonance peak@xcite .",
    "here we theoretically investigate the fano - kondo effect in a triple qd system , depicted in fig .",
    "when two qds are coupled , the energy levels mix , and bonding and anti - bonding states are formed .",
    "thus , it is expected that the current that flows through the detector - qd reflects these electronic states when coupling ratio @xmath0 is sufficiently large , and the fano dip would thus be modulated due to this two - level system .",
    "we can also regard this setup as an extra impurity connected to a t - shaped qd system , or a charge qubit closely attached to a qd detector .",
    "coupled qds can be used as a charge qubit@xcite .",
    "charge qubits are usually capacitively coupled to detectors that are switched on only after quantum computation is finished .",
    "results of quantum computation are readout through the field - effect ( coulomb interaction ) depending on the positions of electrons in the charge qubit@xcite . if transfer of an electron between a charge qubit and a detector is not prohibited ( @xmath1 ) as in the present setup , detector current is expected to be changed by the fano - kondo effect .",
    "this is an alternative method for reading out the quantum state of the charge qubit , although this method might change the quantum state of qubit more than the previous one , because detector electrons go through the charge qubit directly . to operate a coupled qd system as a charge qubit",
    ", we have to maintain the electronic state of the two qds near the degeneracy point of charging energy , or hold the total number of excess electrons in the charge qubit to one .",
    "these requirements lead to stronger constraints on this system . here , as a first step , we consider only an effect of a two - level system without discussing qubit behaviors .",
    "and @xmath2 constitute a two - level system that is coupled to qd @xmath3 only which is connected to the electrodes .",
    "we consider two cases with differing on the strength of on - site coulomb interaction in qd @xmath3 . in",
    "case i , there is no on - site coulomb interaction in qd @xmath3 . in case",
    "ii , there is infinite on - site coulomb interaction in qd @xmath3 . , width=226 ]    a. w. rushforth _",
    "experimentally investigated the fano - kondo effect when there are two side qds near the electronic transport region@xcite .",
    "they showed that fano dip is modulated by the path of electrons through two side qds . compared with a simple t - shaped qd system ,",
    "there are more parameters in this system due to the existence of extra qd .",
    "correspondingly , the fano - kondo effect in this system is expected to show more variety of dip behaviors than that in the t - shaped qds as shown in ref.@xcite . to make the problem transparent without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that there is a single energy level in each qd and that the two energy levels of the qd @xmath4 and qd @xmath2 coincide and correspond to gate voltages that are applied to those qds . for convenience , hereafter we call qd @xmath4 and @xmath2 a  two - level system \"",
    ". we mainly investigate the change of conductance as a function of the gate bias .",
    "we use slave boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) with the help of nonequilibrium keldysh green s functions .",
    "the formulation of sbmft is very useful and a good starting point to study the transport properties of a strongly correlated qd system .",
    "thus , this method is widely used , although it is only usable at a lower temperature ( @xmath5 ) region than the kondo temperature @xmath6@xcite , that is @xmath7 . here",
    ", we investigate two cases differing in the amount of coulomb interaction in qd @xmath3 . in",
    "case i , there is no coulomb interaction ( @xmath8 ) and in case ii , there is an infinite coulomb interaction ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the case i experimentally corresponds to a large qd @xmath3 and the case ii corresponds to a small qd @xmath3 .",
    "it is expected that we can see clear fano effect in case i , and a kondo resonance peak strongly changes fano dip in case ii .",
    "actually , it will be shown that , in order to see the effects of bonding - antibonding states in the detector current , coupling between the two side qds should be strong and the detector should be sufficiently slow only in case i.",
    "the hamiltonian for the case ii is different from that for the case i in that the former has an additional constraint on qd @xmath3 .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian for the case ii is described in terms of slave bosons @xmath10 @xmath11 as :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the energy level for source ( @xmath14 ) and drain ( @xmath15 ) electrodes .",

    "@xmath27 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "we take @xmath28 and @xmath29 as mean field parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian for case i is similar to @xmath30 except that @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .    by applying a conventional procedure@xcite to this hamiltonian , we derive green s functions for qds , for example , @xmath33 _ etc . _ ,",

    "then , we obtain a conductance formula : @xmath54 the ratio @xmath0 compares the internal coupling strength in a two - level system with that between the two - level system and the detector . here , we regard the case where @xmath55 as a strongly coupled two - level system and the case where @xmath56 as a weakly coupled two - level system . because @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ; we assume @xmath44 ) can be approximately estimated as a tunneling rate through the detector , if @xmath59 is sufficiently large , the electron that flows through qd @xmath3 is so fast that it can not detect the oscillation of an electron in the coupled qds @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath59 is small , the electron that flows through qd @xmath3 can observe the oscillation between bonding and antibonding states . therefore , we call a detector with large @xmath60 a fast detector , and one with smaller @xmath61 a slow detector .",

    "however , we can not see the effect of the change caused by the bonding - antibonding state , even if we change @xmath72 . when @xmath79 is reduced as shown in fig.[strong ] ( c )",

    "these behaviors can be understood from dos , which is derived from @xmath81 : @xmath82 instead of a single dip in the numerator in a t - shaped qds@xcite , @xmath83 in the numerator of eq.([dos ] ) indicates double dips , that comes from bonding - antibonding state of side - qds .",
    "figure  [ dosdos ] shows four doss , which are displayed corresponding to fig.[strong ] .",

    "when @xmath90 , at low temperature , conductance can detect the change of closely distributed three peaks in the dos if those peaks are sufficiently sharp such as a slow detector . on the other hand ,",

    "conductance integrates peak structures in dos , resulting in the single - dip structures shown in fig.[strong ] ( b ) and ( d ) .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the present model can be applied to several situations .",
    "if we look at qd @xmath4 as an extra trap site for the t - shaped qd system composed of qd @xmath2 and qd @xmath3 with both electrodes , the present calculation shows that a simple dip structure is most likely to be observed , and when the extra trap site is strongly coupled to the side qd @xmath2 and the energy level of qd @xmath3 is sufficiently low , the modulation of fano dip could be observed .",
    "experimentally , this would happen because it is not easy to exclude all trap sites from the qd system due to the difficulty of nanofabrication@xcite .",
    "the present calculations also indicate that when there are many additional trap sites , the fano dip structure would be modulated further .    to construct a charge qubit@xcite in the present case ,",
    "the total number of electrons in qd @xmath4 and qd @xmath2 should be one .",
