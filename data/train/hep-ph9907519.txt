    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) exists at the electroweak scale , then gluinos and squarks will be copiously produced in pairs at the lhc and will decay via cascades involving other susy particles .",
    "the characteristics of these decays and hence of the signals that will be observed and the measurements that will be made depend upon the actual susy model and in particular on the pattern of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "previous , detailed studies of signals for susy at the lhc@xcite have used the sugra model@xcite , in which the supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the sector of the theory containing the standard model particles and their superpartners via gravitational interactions .",
    "the minimal version of this model has just four parameters plus a sign .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( @xmath4 ) has a mass of order 100  gev , is stable , is produced in the decay of every other supersymmetric particle and is neutral and therefore escapes the detector . the strong production cross sections and the characteristic signals of events with multiple jets plus missing energy @xmath5 or with like - sign dileptons @xmath6 plus @xmath5@xcite enable susy to be extracted trivially from standard model backgrounds .",
    "characteristic signals were identified that can be exploited to determine , with great precision , the fundamental parameters of these model over the whole of its parameter space .",
    "variants of this model where r - parity is broken@xcite and the @xmath4 is unstable have also been discussed@xcite .",
    "these models have characteristic final states depending upon their parameters .",
    "the next to lightest neutral gaugino @xmath7 is produced in the decays of squarks and gluinos which themselves may be produced copiously at the lhc .",
    "the decay of @xmath7 then provides a tag from which the detailed analysis of supersymmetric events can begin .",
    "the dominant decay is usually either @xmath8 or @xmath9 , which can proceed directly or via the two step decay @xmath10 .",
    "the latter leads to events with isolated leptons .",
    "both of these characteristic features have been explored in some detail in previous studies@xcite .    in the previous cases",
    "the smuon , selectron and stau were essentially degenerate . at larger values of @xmath0 ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted and the @xmath11 becomes the lightest slepton .",
    "if @xmath12 is small enough , then the two - body decays @xmath13 , @xmath14 will not be allowed , and if @xmath15 is large enough , then @xmath16 will also not be allowed .",
    "then for large enough @xmath0 the only allowed two - body decays are @xmath17 . in such cases ,",
    "tau decays are dominant , and final states involving tau s must be used .",
    "the simulation in this paper is based on the implementation of the minimal sugra model in isajet@xcite .",
    "we use @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . the mass spectrum for this case",
    "is shown in table  [ mass - table ] .",
    "the only allowed two - body decay of @xmath7 is into @xmath22 , so it has a branching ratio of more than 99% .",
    ".masses of the superpartners , in gev , for the case being studied .",
    "note that the first and second generation squarks and sleptons are degenerate and so are not listed separately .",
    "[ mass - table ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the total production cross - section for this model is 99  pb at the lhc .",
    "the rates are dominated by the production of @xmath23 and @xmath24 final states .",
    "interesting decays include :    * @xmath25% ; @xmath26% * @xmath2713% ; @xmath28% ; * @xmath29% ; @xmath30% ; * @xmath31% ; @xmath32% ; * @xmath33% ; @xmath34% ;    here @xmath35 refers to a light quark .",
    "all the analyses presented here are based on isajet  7.37@xcite and a simple detector simulation .",
    "600k signal events were generated which would correspond to 6 fb@xmath36 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the standard model background samples contained 250k events for each of @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and 5000k qcd jets ( including @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) divided among five bins covering @xmath48 .",
    "fluctuations on the histograms reflect the generated statistics . on many of the plots that we show",
    ", very few standard model background events survive the cuts and the corresponding fluctuations are large , but in all cases we can be confident that the signal is much larger than the residual background . the cuts that we chosen have not been optimized , but rather have been chosen to get background free samples .",
    "the detector response is parameterized by gaussian resolutions characteristic of the atlas@xcite detector without any tails .",
    "all energy and momenta are measured in gev . in the central region of rapidity we take separate resolutions for the electromagnetic ( emcal ) and hadronic ( hcal ) calorimeters , while the forward region uses a common resolution : @xmath49 a uniform segmentation @xmath50 is used with no transverse shower spreading . both atlas@xcite and cms@xcite",
    "have finer segmentation over most of the rapidity range , but the neglect of shower spreading is unrealistic , especially for the forward calorimeter . missing transverse energy",
    "is calculated by taking the magnitude of the vector sum of the transverse energy deposited in in the calorimeter cells .",
    "an oversimplified parameterization of the muon momentum resolution of the atlas detector  including a both the inner tracker and the muon system measurements  is used , _ viz _",
    "@xmath51 for electrons we use a momentum resolution obtained by combining the electromagnetic calorimeter resolution above with a tracking resolution of the form @xmath52 this provides a slight improvement over the calorimeter alone .",
    "jets are found using getjet@xcite with a simple fixed - cone algorithm .",
    "the jet multiplicity in susy events is rather large , so we will use a cone size of @xmath53 unless otherwise stated .",
    "jets are required to have at least @xmath54 ; more stringent cuts are often used .",
    "all leptons are required to be isolated and have some minimum @xmath55 and @xmath56 , consistent with the coverage of the central tracker and muon system .",
    "an isolation requirement that no more than 10  gev of additional @xmath57 be present in a cone of radius @xmath58 around the lepton is used to reject leptons from @xmath47-jets and @xmath46-jets .",
    "in addition to these kinematic cuts a lepton ( @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) efficiency of 90% and a @xmath47-tagging efficiency of 60% is assumed@xcite .    as @xmath61 s are a crucial part of this analysis , they require special treatment .",
    "we concentrate on hadronic tau decays , since for leptonic decays the origin of the lepton is not clear and the visible lepton in general carries only a small fraction of the true tau momentum .",
    "using the fast simulation , we first identify the hadronic taus by searching the reconstructed jet list for jets with @xmath62 gev and @xmath63 .",
    "we then compare these jets with the generated tau momenta and assign them to a reconstructed tau if @xmath64 and the center of the jet and the tau are separated by @xmath65 .",
    "we then rely on a full simulation@xcite of @xmath66 events with @xmath67 .",
    "events were generated with pythia @xcite and passed through the atlas geant simulation ( dice ) and reconstruction ( atrecon ) programs @xcite .",
    "the charged particles were reconstructed with the tracking and the photons with the calorimeter .",
    "cuts were then applied to the invariant mass and isolation of the reconstructed taus .",
    "these cuts produce a rejection factor against qcd jets of a factor of 15 and accept 41% of the hadronic tau decays .",
    "we apply these results to the hadronic tau s identified in our fast simulation on a probabilistic basis .",
    "the accepted hadronic decays are assumed to be measured using the resolution from the full simulation , while the ones not accepted are put back into the jet list .",
    "fake @xmath61 s are made by reassigning jets with the appropriate probability .",
    "the full simulation also indicates that the tau charge is correctly identified 92% of the time .",
    "we include this factor in our fast @xmath61 reconstruction and assign the fake tau s to either sign with equal probability . for cases where the @xmath68 invariant mass is to be measured , the generated @xmath68 invariant mass is smeared with a resolution derived from the full simulation , i.e. , a gaussian with a peak at @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in cases where the measured momentum of the @xmath61 decay products is needed ,",
    "the measured jet energy is used .",
    "results are presented for an integrated luminosity of @xmath71 , corresponding to one year of running at @xmath72 ; pile up has not been included .",
    "we will occasionally comment on the cases where the full design luminosity of the lhc , _",
    "@xmath73 , will be needed to complete the studies . for",
    "many of the histograms shown , a single event can give rise to more than one entry due to different possible combinations .",
    "when this occurs , all combinations are included .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first illustrate how measurement of the @xmath68 final state can be used to infer information on the masses of the staus .",
    "we then use this final state in conjunction with @xmath47-jets to reconstruct gluinos and bottom squarks .",
    "methods for extracting information on light squarks are then shown and the dilepton mass distribution is used to give information on the masses @xmath74 .",
    "finally we show how this information can be combined to constrain the underlying model parameters .",
    "the first step in the search for new physics is to discover a deviation from the standard model and to estimate the mass scale associated with it .",
    "susy production at the lhc is dominated by gluinos and squarks , which decay into multiple jets plus missing energy .",
    "a variable which is sensitive to inclusive gluino and squark decays is the effective mass @xmath75 , defined as the scalar sum of the @xmath55 s of the four hardest jets and the missing transverse energy @xmath5 , @xmath76 here the jet @xmath55 s have been ordered such that @xmath77 is the transverse momentum of the leading jet .",
    "the standard model backgrounds tend to have smaller @xmath5 , fewer jets and a lower jet multiplicity .",
    "in addition , since a major source of @xmath5 is weak decays , large @xmath5 events in the standard model tend to have the missing energy associated with leptons . to suppress these backgrounds ,",
    "the following cuts were made :    * @xmath78 ; * @xmath79 jets with @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; * transverse sphericity @xmath82 ; * no @xmath60 or isolated @xmath59 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 ; * @xmath85 .",
    "note that some of these jets could result from hadronic tau decays . with these cuts and",
    "the idealized detector assumed here , the signal is much larger than the standard model backgrounds for large @xmath75 , as is illustrated in figure  [ point6meff ] .",
    "thus , the discovery strategy developed for low @xmath0@xcite also works for this case . as demonstrated in more detail elsewhere@xcite the shape of this effective mass distribution can be used to estimate the masses of the susy particles that are most copiously produced ; here quarks and gluinos .",
    "as can be seen from the decays listed above we expect significant prodution of @xmath7 and hence of tau pairs from the decay of @xmath86 we require that the events contain at least two jets that are indentified as hadronic tau decays using the above algorithm .",
    "in addition , the following cuts are applied :    * @xmath78 ; * at least four jets with @xmath80 and at least one jet @xmath81 ; * @xmath87 ; * @xmath85 .",
    "again , some of these jets could result from hadronic tau decays .",
    "we then search for taus that decay hadronically using the algrotihm discussed above .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath68 invarient mass distribution is shown in figure  [ mtautau ] ; all combinations of tau charges are shown in this figure .",
    "it can be seen from this distribution that there is a clear structure .",
    "there is considerable background from combinations where one of the identified tau jets is from a tau and the other is from a misidentified jet .",
    "the invarient mass distribution of these pairs is also shown in figure  [ mtautau ] ; it is rather featureless .",
    "the tau algorthm has not been optimized so this background could well have been overestimated .",
    "the background from events where both taus are misidentified jets and the standard model background are both negligible .",
    "the position of the peak in this mass distribution enables one to infer the position of the end point arising from the decay chain @xmath88 : @xmath89    in order to estimate the precision with which this endpoint can be determined , the generated tau - tau invarient mass distribution was shifted by @xmath90% from its nominal value .",
    "the effect on the reconstructed @xmath68 mass distribution is shown in figure  [ mtautau1 ] .",
    "these cases can clearly be distinguished .",
    "the actual precision that can be obtained on the position of this end point requires a more detailed study .",
    "tau decays are well understood ; the problem is to determine the effects of the detector resolutions and the cuts . for the purposes of extracting parameters below",
    ", we will assume an uncertainty of 5% can be achieved .",
    "there are some events beyond this edge as can be seen by looking at the subtracted distribution @xmath91 shown in figure  [ subtracted ] .",
    "this subtraction also elliminates the background from fake taus because their charges are not correlated . here",
    "the excess extends to @xmath92 gev and is due to @xmath93 and @xmath94 decays .",
    "this can be confirmed by the large @xmath95 signal ( see below ) .",
    "the fluctuations in this histogram reflect the generated statistics , which correspond to about @xmath96 ; three years at low luminosity would make this high - mass signal much clearer .",
    "the event sample of the previous section is used in an attempt to reconstruct squarks and gluinos .",
    "we concentrate here on final states with @xmath47 quarks as these have the larger branching ratios and less combinatorial background .",
    "in addition to the previous cuts , we require a tagged @xmath47-jet with @xmath98 gev ; this jet could be one of the ones in the previous selection .",
    "events are selected that have reconstructed tau pairs with invariant mass within @xmath99 gev of peak in figure  [ mtautau ] , and the invariant mass of the tau pair and the @xmath47-jet is formed .",
    "this mass distribution is shown in figure  [ sbot ] .",
    "the sign subtracted distribution corresponding to @xmath100 is used to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "there should should be an edge at @xmath101  gev .",
    "the edge is not sharp  3 particles are lost , two @xmath102 s and the @xmath4 . in addition",
    "the distribution is contaminated by decays from @xmath103 and @xmath74 .",
    "the structure is not clear , but is well distinguished from that resulting from the case where the @xmath47-jet is replaced by a light quark jet , shown in figure  [ p6left ] .",
    "further information can be obtained by applying a partial reconstruction technique .",
    "this was developed in ref .",
    "( so called `` point  3 '' ) where the decay chain @xmath104 was fully reconstructed as follows .",
    "if the mass of the lepton pair is near its maximum value , then in the rest frame of @xmath7 both @xmath105 and the @xmath106 pair are forced to be at rest .",
    "the momentum of @xmath7 in the laboratory frame is then determined @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the momentum of the dilepton system .",
    "the @xmath7 can then be combined with b jets to reconstruct the decay chain . a clear correlation between the masses of the @xmath109 and @xmath110 systems",
    "was observed allowing both the gluino and sbottom masses to be determined if the mass of @xmath4 was assumed .",
    "the inferred mass difference @xmath111 was found to be insensitive to assumed @xmath4 mass .    in the case of interest here",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "first , there is an extra step in the decay chain _ i.e. _   @xmath112 . so that even if the events could be selected such that the @xmath68 invariant mass was at the kinematic limit , @xmath4 would not be at rest in the @xmath7 rest frame , and the inferred @xmath7 momenta would not be correct .",
    "this was the case at `` point  5 ''",
    "@xcite where the method was applied to the decay chain @xmath113 and nevertheless , a mass peak was reconstructed in that case .",
    "second , the momentum of the @xmath68 system can not be measured owing to the lost energy from neutrinos . despite these problems",
    "the method is still effective as is now demonstrated .",
    "we select events with reconstructed @xmath68 mass in the range @xmath114 and infer the momentum of @xmath7 from the measured momentum @xmath115 of the @xmath68 system assuming the nominal value of @xmath116 . @xmath117",
    "this momentum is then combined with that of two measured b - jets each required to have @xmath118  gev and the mass of the @xmath119 and @xmath120 systems computed .",
    "figure  [ p6lego ] shows the correlation @xmath121 vs.  @xmath122 in a lego plot .",
    "the subtracted distribution corresponding to @xmath91 is used to reduce the background .",
    "there is a clear peak in this plot .",
    "the projection of this plot onto the @xmath123 axis is shown in figure  [ p6diff ] which shows a peak at 120 gev , somewhat below the true mass difference of 150  gev . if a selection of events with 120 gev @xmath124 gev is made and figure  [ p6lego ] projected onto the @xmath125 axis the result is shown in figure  [ p6proj ] . a fairly sharp peak results at a value somewhat below the gluino mass of 540  gev .",
    "this displacement to lower values is due to two effects ; jet energy is lost out of the clustering cone and carried off by neutrinos is semileptonic bottom and charm decays .",
    "we have not recalibrated the @xmath126jet energy scale to take account of these effects .",
    "we now attempt to find evidence for the decay chain @xmath127 .",
    "the rates are not large due to the small branching ratio for the first step , and we can expect considerable combinatorial background from qcd radiation of light quark and gluon jets .",
    "the event sample of section  [ sec : tau ] is used .",
    "in addition we require the presence of a non @xmath47-jet with @xmath98 gev .",
    "events are selected that have reconstructed tau pairs with invarient mass within @xmath128 of peak in figure  [ mtautau ] , and the invariant mass of the tau pair and the jet is formed .",
    "this mass distribution is shown in figure  [ p6left ] .",
    "the sign subtracted distribution corresponding to @xmath100 is used as it reduces combinatorical background .",
    "there should should be an edge at @xmath129 .",
    "the edge is not sharp  two @xmath102 s and the @xmath4 are all lost . in addtion",
    "the distribtution is contaminated by decays from @xmath103 and @xmath74 . while this distribution is clealy distinct from that shown above where b - jets were used , more work is needed to establish that this could be used to infer information on the light squark mass .",
    "this analysis is based on the fact that @xmath131 is dominant , so @xmath132 pair production gives a pair of hard jets and large missing energy .",
    "there is no kinematic endpoint , but the @xmath55 of the jets provides a measure of the squark mass @xcite .",
    "the following cuts were made :    * @xmath133 * 2 jets with @xmath134 * no other jet with @xmath135 * transverse sphericity @xmath82 * @xmath85 * no leptons , no b - jets , no tau jets    the transverse momentum distribution of the leading jets is shown in figure  [ qright ] .",
    "the error on the mass is limited by the systematics of understanding the production dynamics and the susy backgrounds .",
    "studies of other cases @xcite have shown that this distribution should enable a precision of @xmath136 to be reached ; it might be possible to achieve @xmath137 in a high statistics study .",
    "while the light gauginos decay almost entirely into @xmath61 s , the heavy ones can decay via @xmath138 , giving opposite - sign , same - flavor leptons .",
    "the largest combined branching is for @xmath139 , which gives a dilepton endpoint at @xmath140 there is of course a large background from leptonic @xmath61 decays , but this can be cancelled statistically by measuring the flavor - subtracted combination @xmath141 as we now demonstrate .",
    "events were selected to have two leptons with @xmath142 and @xmath84 in addition to the jet and @xmath5 cuts described earlier ( see section  [ sec : tau ] : no tau requirement is applied here ) .",
    "figure  [ mmumu ] shows the distribution in the @xmath143 final state .",
    "a clear peak from @xmath95 decay is visible that results from @xmath93 and @xmath94 decays .",
    "the flavor - subtracted combination @xmath141 is shown in figure  [ mmumusub ] and shows an excess extending to @xmath144 gev . unlike the distributions involvin tau final states , this one can be extrapolated to high luminosity operation which will surely be needed to extract a quantitative result from it .",
    "the presence of the dijet signal of section  [ sec : qright ] implies that that @xmath145 .",
    "likewise the failure to observe a dilepton peak implies that @xmath146 .",
    "these results are used together with the assumed errors on the measured quantities to fit the model parameters .",
    "the values of the errors on @xmath111 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and the @xmath68 edge are shown in table  [ tab - fit ] .",
    "we do not use the information from figures [ p6left ] and [ mmumusub ] as we have not estimated the quantitative information that they could give .",
    "two fits are shown since the sign of @xmath60 can not be determined .",
    "this is expected : a change of conventions can replace @xmath149 with @xmath150 , and @xmath151 are equivalent .",
    "we assume that the higgs mass is measured via its decay to two photons .",
    "the error on the higgs mass is likely to be dominated by the theoretical uncertainty on the higher order corrections ; both the one - loop and the dominant two - loop effects have been calculated and are large .",
    "the present error is probably about @xmath152 ; this might be reduced to @xmath153 with much more work .",
    "the ultimate limit comes from the experimental error , about @xmath154 .",
    "the effect of reducing this error is only apparent in the error of the fitted value of @xmath0 whose error is reduced by approximately a factor of two if @xmath153 error on the higgs mass is used .",
    "the table shows various assumptions for the errors that might be achieved .",
    "the numbers in the first column are conservative and will be achieved with the 10 fb@xmath36 of integrated luminosity shown on the figures .",
    "the rightmost column is an estimate of what might ultimately be achievable .",
    "we caution the reader that the measurements involving tau s may not be possible at a luminosity of @xmath155 @xmath156 sec@xmath36 due to pileup effects .",
