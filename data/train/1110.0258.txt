    "we consider discrete quasi one - dimensional schrdinger operators on strips of width @xmath4 of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an @xmath7 sequence of vectors in @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a bounded sequence of hermitian @xmath10 matrices .",
    "such an operator is a so called tight binding model for a cable with @xmath4 channels .",

    "the matrix potentials @xmath12 describe the hopping or interaction between the different channels and may also include some potential .",
    "a particular case of interest are models where the @xmath12 are perturbations of a fixed matrix @xmath13 . if @xmath14 for all @xmath15 then one finds bloch waves and the operator describes a pure , space homogeneous cable with a pure crystal structure .",
    "the perturbations then model impurities in the cable .",
    "for instance , randomly doped semiconductors are supposed to be modeled by random potentials @xmath12 . for instance",
    ", the case where @xmath16 and the @xmath12 are independently identically distributed corresponds to the one - dimensional anderson model as proposed by anderson @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath12 to be distributed according to the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) or the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) for @xmath17 corresponds to a wegner @xmath4-orbital model .",
    "wegner@xcite studied the @xmath18 limit of such models .",
    "the focus in mathematical physics often lies in the spectral theory on the infinite strip . from a solid state physics point of view the electronic properties of finite pieces",
    "are quite of interest .",
    "the general idea is that absolutely continuous spectrum corresponds to a conductor even for infinitely long pieces , whereas anderson localization corresponds to an isolator when the length of the piece is much larger than the localization length .    in the theory of electronic conduction as developed by landauer @xcite , imry @xcite and bttiker @xcite a scattering approach is used .",
    "the idea is that the electronic properties of such a finite piece , from now on called the scatterer , is in principle given by considering the scattering of this piece inserted inside an",
    "_ ideal lead_. by ideal lead one means a pure cable with only elliptic ( propagative ) channels .",
    "the mathematical definition will be given in the next section .",
    "the scattering matrix for this scattering problem describes reflection and transmission of incoming bloch waves to outgoing bloch waves on the right and left of the scatterer .",
    "related in a twisted way to this scattering matrix is the _ @xmath19-transfer matrix _ giving the transfer from waves from the left to the right of the scatterer .",
    "we call it @xmath19-transfer matrix as it is obtained from the scattering matrix and we will use the terminology _ transfer matrix _ for a different object .    from the scattering matrix or the @xmath19-transfer matrix one can calculate certain quantities such as the landauer conductance or shot noise . for more information on these connections",
    "i recommend the review by beenakker @xcite . the scattering and the @xmath19-transfer matrices depend on the specific choice of an ideal lead as well as on the choice of a basis for its bloch waves , but important quantities such as the landauer conductance do not .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath19-transfer matrix compared to the scattering matrix is the so called multiplicity property .",
    "the physics intuition is the following .",
    "suppose one puts two scatterers together which are described by @xmath19-transfer matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then the first transfer matrix @xmath20 connects the amplitudes and phase information of waves on the left of scatterer 1 to the right of scatterer 1 which is the left of scatterer 2 .",
    "now , @xmath21 connects these amplitudes and phases to the ones on the right of scatterer 2 .",
    "therefore , the product @xmath22 connects the amplitudes and phases on the left of the two scatterers to the right of the two scatterers .",
    "thus , @xmath22 corresponds to the @xmath19-transfer matrix of both pieces put together .    in the mathematical analysis of operators",
    "as given by one defines the _ transfer matrix _ from the stationary schrdinger equation ( cf . and ) .",
    "these transfer matrices satisfy the multiplicity property which can be seen easily . for an ideal lead",
    "the transfer matrix is conjugated to a unitary matrix .",
    "if one diagonalizes it then it looks like the @xmath19-transfer matrix of bloch waves .",
    "in fact , it seems to be quite known that using the same basis change of a disordered piece corresponds to the @xmath19-transfer matrix of this piece w.r.t . the same ideal lead .",
    "for instance , this is mentioned in ref .",
    "bdr and it will be confirmed in this article .",
    "an important development in the electronic conduction theory is the so called dmpk@xcite theory and dmpk equation .",
    "this is a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) describing the conductance of a disordered wire with respect to its length in a macroscopic setup .",
    "bachman and de  roeck@xcite analyzed the connection of the microscopical anderson model on a strip to dmpk theory .",
    "if the unperturbed operator describes an ideal lead , then they found an sde describing the evolution of the transfer matrices in an appropriate scaling limit .",
    "this can not be obtained if the unperturbed operator is a pure cable with elliptic ( propagative ) and hyperbolic ( non - propagative ) channels .",
    "i believe that in this case one should consider the @xmath19-transfer matrix coming from scattering a disordered piece with respect to the unperturbed operator . in these cases",
    "the scattering matrices and the @xmath19-transfer matrices are of lower dimensions than the transfer matrices . also , the multiplicity property for the @xmath19-transfer matrices is no longer valid , but it still holds for the transfer matrices .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze the relations between these matrices in this case ( cf . theorem  [ th - main0 ] ) .    from a physics point of view",
    ", the scattering matrix of a finite disordered piece with respect to a cable with hyperbolic channels does not only contain information about the scatterer but also about the cable .",
    "this is in principle also true if one has an ideal lead , but since an ideal lead has only propagative channels , it does not affect important quantities such as the landauer conductance . however , hyperbolic channels do have an effect .",
    "therefore , it should be treated as a scatterer itself . by physics intuition ,",
    "the situation of having the finite scatterer inserted inside an infinite cable should be described by the following limit : we take a piece of the cable of length @xmath2 , followed from the finite scatterer and another piece of length @xmath2 of the cable.,then we obtain the scattering matrix for these three blocks together inserted in an ideal lead and take the limit @xmath3 ( cf .",

    "as described above , let @xmath23 be an operator on @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 where @xmath9 is a sequence of hermitian @xmath10 matrices .",
    "@xmath23 describes a cable with @xmath4 channels .",
    "associated with such an operator are the transfer matrices @xmath26 .",
    "they arise from the stationary schrdinger equation @xmath27 , which gives @xmath28 note that @xmath26 is in the conjugate symplectic group @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 the individual blocks are all of size @xmath10 .",
    "this group is different from the complex symplectic group @xmath31 .    the transfer matrix of the block of length @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , is given by the product @xmath36 if @xmath27 .",
    "this product only depends on @xmath1 and the sequence @xmath37 .",
    "hence , for a fixed energy @xmath1 , each such sequence gives rise to a certain transfer matrix .",
    "moreover , the transfer matrix for two consecutive blocks ( sequences ) , is just the product of the transfer matrices for each block , e.g. @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we referred to this as the multiplicity property in the introduction above .",
    "we want to insert a finite block of length @xmath40 within a space - homogeneous cable and consider it as a scatterer within the cable .",
    "the scatterer will be described by the sequence @xmath41 and the transfer matrix @xmath42 which connects @xmath43 to @xmath44 for a solution of @xmath27 .",
    "the space - homogeneous cable will be described by the operator @xmath45 the difference to @xmath23 is that the hermitian matrix @xmath13 is always the same and @xmath0 is invariant by translations on @xmath46 .",
    "therefore we call @xmath0 space - homogeneous .    inserting the finite scatterer",
    "is described by changing the operator @xmath0 on a finite piece .",
    "therefore , let @xmath47 satisfy @xmath48 then the operator @xmath23 as defined in describes the cable with the inserted scatterer given by the sequence @xmath41 .",
    "the scattering of this piece is described by the unitary scattering operator @xmath49 of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath0 , where @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath51 commutes with @xmath0 , it can be represented by scattering matrices on the energy shells for ( almost ) each energy @xmath1 in the spectrum of @xmath0 .",

    "let @xmath52 be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of @xmath13 with corresponding real eigenvalues @xmath53 .",

    "the corresponding extended states of @xmath0 can be split into @xmath59 right - moving and @xmath59 left - moving waves at energy @xmath1 . in the sequel",

    "a short overview is given within a review by beenakker @xcite .",
    "we will call this transfer matrix the @xmath19-transfer matrix @xmath65 in order to distinguish it from the transfer matrix as defined above .",
    "the @xmath19-transfer matrix connects waves on the left to waves on the right of the finite scatterer , whereas the scattering matrix , let us call it @xmath66 , relates incoming and outgoing waves . for the scattering matrix @xmath66 we choose the following convention .",
    "writing @xmath67 , the @xmath68 matrices @xmath69 correspond to transmission of waves from left to right , resp .",

    "it will be confirmed once more .",
    "the new investigation in this paper is the relation if the background operator @xmath0 has hyperbolic channels .",
