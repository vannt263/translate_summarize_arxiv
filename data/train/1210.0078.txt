    "in one of his articles ( see [ 2 ] ) , temistocle birsan examines collinearity properties of a convex quadrilateral with a set of well - defined points located either on its boundary , diagonals or at the intersection of some lines .",
    "surprisingly , given the arbitrary nature of the quadrilateral and the little hypothesis , it turns out that no less than eight lines pass through the intersection point of the diagonals .",
    "influenced by the aforementioned work this paper considers a more general setting , starting with a convex quadrilateral in the euclidean plane and four points situated one on each side .",
    "lines are drawn between these points and the vertices , and various intersection points - possibly with the diagonals - are defined .",
    "while in birsan s article only one point s location on a line can vary and all other points are fixed with respect to it , now we change our point of view and consider a single condition for the entire system ( this condition involves the ratios determined by the four points lying on the sides of the quadrilateral )",
    ".    we would expect to find a configuration poor in potentially useful properties , however it turns out to be the exact opposite : seven lines are concurrent .",
    "afterwards we remove this condition as well and analyse the resulting configuration in the most random scenario possible .",
