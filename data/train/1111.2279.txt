    "semiclassical laser theory , which neglects the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , is widely used to describe and simulate lasers @xcite . in principle",
    ", it correctly describes the laser thresholds and frequencies , the spatial pattern of the lasing modes , and the laser output power , including all classical non - linear effects , such as spatial hole - burning , gain saturation , and mode and phase locking .",
    "essentially the theory describes maxwell s equations in an open cavity , coupled to the non - linear polarization of the gain medium .",
    "the gain polarization can be described using either a classical non - linear oscillator model @xcite , or a quantum - mechanical model of @xmath0 atomic levels in which the polarization and level populations obey the equations of motion of the quantum density matrix .",
    "the simplest version of the theory , used widely in textbooks , is the two - level maxwell - bloch ( mb ) model @xcite ; however , most design and characterization simulations of lasers use models with @xmath1 or more levels . in addition , most theoretical solutions for the semiclassical laser equations employ a large number of simplifying assumptions in order to make them analytically tractable , most notably neglecting the openness of the cavity and/or treating only simple one - dimensional ( 1d ) or ring cavities , as well as approximating the non - linear interactions to cubic order . the results are typically not useful for quantitative modeling . until recently ,",
    "the only useful way to obtain quantitative results for non - trivial laser structures was to integrate the semiclassical laser equations in space and time . for novel and interesting new laser structures with non - trivial 2d and 3d cavity geometries ,",
    "such simulations are at the limits of computational feasibility , making it difficult to study a large parameter space or ensemble of designs .    in the past five years a new approach to finding the stationary solutions of the semiclassical laser equations has been developed , known as steady state ab initio laser theory ( salt)@xcite .",
    "salt treats the openness of the cavity exactly , and the multimode non - linear interactions to infinite order ( with two approximations , to be discussed below ) .",
    "it is applicable to cavities of arbitrary complexity in 2d and 3d , although we will discuss here only the scalar wave equation coupled to a gain medium .",
    "importantly , this approach eliminates the need to perform a time integration to steady - state , dramatically reducing the computational effort and allowing one to study cavities with high spatial complexity , such as 2d random lasers @xcite , photonic crystal lasers @xcite and chaotic disk microlasers @xcite .",
    "salt was originally formulated to solve the steady - state two - level maxwell - bloch equations @xcite in the standard slowly - varying envelope approximation ( svea ) , and an iterative algorithm was developed @xcite to solve the resulting salt equations .",
    "subsequently it was realized that the svea afforded no advantage in numerical solutions of the salt equations , so this approximation was dropped , leading to slightly different salt equations @xcite , which were used in all subsequent work @xcite .",
    "recently an important generalization of the salt solution algorithm was developed , improving its performance for laser cavities with complex spatial index variation and inhomogeneous pumping @xcite . in its present form ,",
    "salt only employs two approximations , the stationary inversion approximation ( sia ) and the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which are both well satisfied for most lasers of interest . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the results of salt were compared to the full time - dependent solution of the mb equations for a simple 1d cavity in the multimode regime , well above threshold .",
    "excellent agreement was found in the parameter regime for which the sia holds .",
    "this was , to our knowledge , the first demonstration of a frequency - domain method which agrees with exact time - domain methods for above - threshold multimode lasing .",
    "previous applications of salt have focused on two - level gain media . in order for salt to be a useful modeling tool , it is necessary to demonstrate that it can be applied to @xmath0-level lasers .",
    "in the current work , we show analytically that the steady - state equations for an @xmath0-level laser can be reduced to those for an effective two - level system , and hence solved using the efficient salt algorithm with essentially the same degree of computational effort .",
    "we also explore how this effective two - level system differs from the ordinary two - level laser .",
    "next , we present a numerical comparison between the results of salt calculations and exact @xmath0-level finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) calculations , for the same simple 1d laser studied in @xcite , as well as for a 1d random laser .",

    ", @xmath22 increases with increasing pump and @xmath21 saturates with increasing pump : @xmath48 this regime is also interesting from the viewpoint of salt . as @xmath22 increases with @xmath10 , a laser could satisfy the inequality @xmath49 near threshold , leading to stationary inversion and an accurate solution via salt , but fail to satisfy the inequality as the pump becomes stronger , leading to a decrease in the accuracy of salt .    for a system with an arbitrary number of levels , the first regime always occurs at sufficiently small pump values ; the second regime is obtainable if electrons in the upper lasing level are relatively long - lived compared to electrons in other levels .",
    "for completeness we briefly outline salt .",

    "it also includes infinite - order nonlinear `` hole - burning '' modal interactions , seen in the @xmath68 dependence of ( [ tsg2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , we make the key requirement that @xmath66 must be purely out - going outside the cavity ; it is this condition that makes the problem non - hermitian .",
    "it is worth noting that the sia is not needed until at least two modes are above threshold , so ( [ tsg2 ] ) is exact for single - mode lasing up to and including the second threshold ( aside from the well - obeyed rwa ) .",
    "these equations are solved efficiently by projecting them onto a complete biorthogonal set of purely outgoing states with external wavevectors , @xmath69 , equal to the lasing frequencies .",
    "we refer to these states as the _ threshold constant flux _ ( tcf ) states , because one member of the basis set is always equal to the ( non - interacting ) threshold lasing mode , leading to very rapid convergence of the basis expansion above threshold @xcite .",
    "the major computational effort in solving the salt equations by this approach is in calculating the ( linear ) tcf states .",
    "the salt solutions are obtained for successive values of the pump increasing from the first threshold ; at each step , the coefficients of the lasing modes in the tcf basis are obtained using a standard non - linear solver , with the coefficients from the previous step as an initial guess ( which is never far from the correct solution ) .",

    "in this section we present a set of benchmarks comparing the computational efficiency of salt to fdtd .",
    "salt calculations enjoy three main advantages over fdtd simulations of the semiclassical laser equations .",
    "first and foremost , salt directly finds the steady - state solutions , so no time integration is involved , which substantially decreases computational effort .",
    "second , salt unambiguously determines how many modes are lasing at a given pump , whereas it can be difficult to determine , especially for multimode lasing , when an fdtd simulation has reached the steady - state with all modes that will lase  on \" .",
    "third , within salt , with minimal additional computational effort , it is possible to monitor modes which are _ below _ threshold via a modified threshold matrix @xcite , and hence to ascertain if more modes are likely to turn on in some interval of pump .",
    "it is important to note that the implementation of salt used in this study has also not yet been fully optimized .",
    "for instance , the implementation of salt used in this study requires calculating the entire lasing intensity and frequency spectrum starting from the first lasing threshold .",
    "however , this is not necessary and it is possible to implement salt to take an initial guess of the number of modes and their relative intensities and then allow the algorithm to flow to the correct solution as the salt algorithm has been demonstrated to be rather robust @xcite .",
    "thus , while one might assume from fig .",
    "[ rtfig ] that there would be a crossover pump value , high above threshold , where it would be more efficient to calculate the steady - state solutions using fdtd , this is not necessarily the case",
    ".    salt does have one disadvantage that fdtd does not , assuming the cavity is not in the chaotic regime .",
    "the convergence time in fdtd is determined by the longest time scale in the problem , which is the greater of beating period between consecutive modes and the relaxation oscillation time .",
    "these time scales are relatively independent of the number of modes lasing in the cavity , so the efficiency is largely independent of the pump in the multimode regime .",
    "this is not the case for salt , as the computational time increases as @xmath104 where @xmath0 is the number of lasing modes .",
    "however , as we see in fig .",
    "[ rtfig ] , even a non - optimal implementation of salt is substantially more efficient than fdtd even when calculating the steady state of a single pump value .    .",
    "fdtd simulations that have not begun to lase are marked as crosses .",
    "plot ( a ) shows data for @xmath105 , just above the first lasing threshold .",
    "salt determined the steady - state single modal intensity in under three minutes , while the fdtd required @xmath106 minutes to reach steady state .",
    "plot ( b ) shows data for @xmath107 , well above the third lasing threshold .",
    "salt calculated all data up to and including this pump value in under 90 minutes , whereas fdtd required @xmath108 minutes for the first two modes to reach steady - state , with the third mode intensity ( green circles ) still fluctuating after @xmath109 minutes ( not shown ) .",
    "[ rtfig],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    calculating full modal intensity / frequency curves as a function of the pump strength , such as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , is generally much more efficient using salt .",
    "for example , in order to generate the curves seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , salt ran for a little under 2 processor hours . to generate",
    "all of the fdtd data for the four level simulations took 267 processor days .",
    "if one is attempting to explore a large parameter space of designs or system parameters , salt may make studies feasible which are simply impractical using fdtd , particularly in more realistic 2d and 3d structures .    as mentioned before",
    ", the bulk of the computational effort required for the salt algorithm , especially in higher dimensions , is in solving for the tcf states . while the difficulty of solving for the tcf states does scale with the dimensionality of the system , one only need solve the associated generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath110 ( even in higher dimensions ) to have a sufficiently complete basis for all pump values ,",
    "whereas in fdtd one needs to solve an @xmath111 problem at each of many thousands , if not millions , of time steps .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that switching to a finite element method in higher dimensions is not only possible , but likely to result in increased computational efficiency .",
    "once one has a tcf basis library , using the salt algorithm to iterate above threshold does not directly scale with the dimensionality of the system .",
    "finally , while current implementations of salt assume the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation , the vectorial generalization of salt is under investigation .",
    "we have found that using stationarity conditions on the non - lasing level populations , the rate equations for an @xmath0-level laser can be mapped to an effective two - level model , for which the steady - state multimode lasing properties are efficiently solvable using steady - state ab initio laser theory ( salt ) . using this mapping",
    ", we found excellent agreement between salt and fdtd simulations for the modal frequencies , thresholds and above - threshold intensities , in the expected domain of validity .",
    "salt is typically several orders of magnitude more efficient computationally than time domain solution of the laser - rate equations , assuming only steady - state properties are needed .",
    "we thank robert j. tandy , hui cao , and peter bermel for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf grant no . dmr-0908437 .",
    "throughout this paper , we have used the density matrix equations of motion for the polarization field . however , much of the literature uses the classical oscillating dipole equation , in which the gain atoms are assumed to be dipoles undergoing harmonic oscillations and the quantum density matrix is neglected .",
    "this appendix briefly demonstrates that the two models are equivalent , and derives the relevant parameter redefinitions .",
    "a more thorough discussion has been given by boyd @xcite .",
    "the polarization equation used here , @xmath112 is derived from the density matrix equation @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the upper and lower lasing states , @xmath116 is the density matrix element @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the coupling constant of the lasing states to the electric field , which allows for the definition @xmath119 .",
    "alternatively , following the notation of boyd @xcite , we could consider the equation of motion for @xmath120 , which is the expectation value of the dipole moment induced by the applied field , i.e.  the classical oscillating dipole field .",
    "thus @xmath121 using ( [ dme ] ) , and @xmath122 this can be rewritten as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the inversion density of the lasing states . for @xmath125 , we can discard the term @xmath126 , resulting in the traditional form of the classical oscillating dipole polarization field equation .",
    "this gives the classical coupling constant @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis can used to show that the inversion equation can be rewritten as @xmath128 which demonstrates how the change in the inversion is dependent upon the classical polarization field .",
    "therefore , so long as @xmath125 , a condition that is usually satisfied , these two formulations of the polarization dynamics are equivalent .",
    "this appendix derives the effective equilibrium inversion and relaxation rate for a gain medium with an arbitrary number of levels .",
    "we allow decays between any two levels , even if they are not adjacent .",
    "we assume there is a single lasing transition , between levels @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which need not be adjacent .",
