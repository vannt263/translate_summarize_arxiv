    "any practical quantum technology , such as quantum key distribution or quantum computing , must function robustly in the presence of noise .",
    "many modern `` classical '' technologies tolerate noise , faulty parts , etc .",
    ", by relying on _ feedback control _ systems , which monitor the system and use this information to control its state .",
    "given the ubiquity and power of feedback control for classical systems , it is worthwhile investigating how such control concepts can be applied to quantum technologies as well .",
    "however , strategies for _ quantum control _ must take into account some fundamental features of quantum mechanics , namely , restrictions on information gain , and measurement back - action .",
    "classically , it is possible in principle to acquire all the information about the state of a system with certainty by using sufficiently precise measurements .",
    "that is , the state of a single classical system can be precisely determined via measurement . for quantum systems , however , this is not always possible : if the system is prepared in one of several non - orthogonal states , no measurement can determine which preparation occurred with certainty .",
    "in addition , for quantum systems , monitoring comes at a price : any measurement that acquires information about a system must necessarily disturb it uncontrollably .",
    "this feature is often referred to as _ back - action _  the fundamental noise induced on a system through any measurement , which maintains the uncertainty relations .",
    "this feature of quantum measurement is also distinct from the classical situation , wherein measurements that do not alter the state of the system can in principle be performed",
    ".    these two fundamental features of quantum systems  that non - orthogonal states can not be perfectly discriminated , and that any information gain via measurement necessarily implies disturbance to the system  require a reevaluation of conventional methods and techniques from control theory when developing the theory of quantum control .    in this paper , we investigate the use of measurement and feedback control of a single qubit , prepared in one of two non - orthogonal states and subsequently subjected to noise .",
    "our main result is that , in order to optimize the performance of the control scheme ( as quantified by the average fidelity of the corrected state compared to the initial state ) , one must use non - projective measurements with a strength that balances the trade - off between information gain and disturbance .",
    "belavkin was the first to recognise the importance of feedback control for quantum systems and describe a theoretical framework for analysing both discrete and continuous time models @xcite . despite this early start , it is only recently that the degree of control and isolation of quantum systems has progressed to the point that the experimental exploration of quantum control tasks has been possible @xcite , and the field is now undergoing rapid development ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the specific control problem we are interested in here is the stabilization against noise of states of a single two level system .",
    "similar problems have been considered in continuous time feedback models , e.g. , the stabilization of a single state of a driven and damped two - level atom  @xcite and the maintenance of the coherence of a qubit undergoing decoherence  @xcite .",
    "several recent papers have investigated state preparation and feedback stabilization onto eigenstates of a continuously - measured observable in higher - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these prior investigations , we investigate a feedback scheme to stabilize _ two _ non - orthogonal states of a two - level system .",
    "we work in a discrete - time setting , rather than continuous - time as considered in most prior work , which considerably simplifies the problem and most clearly illustrates the central concepts .",
    "gregoratti and werner have investigated exactly this kind of model of recovering the state of the system after interaction with the environment  @xcite in the case where it is possible to make measurements on the environment . in our setting",
    "we imagine that the environment that causes the initial decoherence is not available subsequently for the feedback protocol .",
    "our main interest is to investigate the effects of the kind of trade - off between information and disturbance that is ubiquitous in quantum information in a concrete optimal control problem .",
    "related information - disturbance trade - offs in quantum feedback control are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that implementing quantum operations on a single qubit through the use of measurement and feedback control as considered here has been investigated for eavesdropping strategies in quantum cryptography  @xcite and for engineering general open - system dynamics  @xcite .",
    "note that there is a fundamental difference between the kind of quantum control problem we are considering here and the related task of quantum error correction .",
    "( for an introduction to the latter , see  @xcite . ) the essence of quantum error correction is to _ encode _ abstract quantum information into a physical quantum system and to choose degrees of freedom that are unaffected by the relevant noise , or upon which errors can be deterministically corrected",
    ". however , it can be the case that one wishes to protect particular physical degrees of freedom of quantum systems and one is not free to choose an arbitrary encoding .",
    "( one such example is _ reference frame distribution _ via the exchange of quantum systems ) .",
    "the quantum states required for these schemes can not be encoded into quantum error correcting codes or noiseless subsystems  @xcite ; protecting such systems from noise may therefore be an application of this kind of quantum control .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : task ] , we define the control task in detail ; in section  [ sec : classical ] , we present and determine the performance of control strategies based on `` classical '' concepts .",
    "section  [ sec : quantum ] introduces our quantum strategy , investigating the use of _ weak _ quantum measurements , and analyses its performance against the strategies of section  [ sec : classical ] .",
    "we also demonstrate that our quantum control scheme is optimal for the task at hand . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we discuss the implications of our result and their relevance to other problems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the key issues we will confront when applying concepts from control theory to finite - dimensional quantum systems . in order to facilitate the analysis and to be able to concentrate on the key departures from classical control , we will chose a very simple quantum system and noise model .",
    "the emphasis is not towards a practical task , but as an illustrative example .",
    "consider the following operational task : a qubit prepared in one of two non - orthogonal states @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( with overlap @xmath2 for @xmath3 ) is transmitted along a noisy quantum channel . without knowing which state was transmitted , we will attempt to `` correct '' the system , i.e. , undo the effect of the noise , through the use of a control scheme based on measurement and feedback ; see fig .

    "the noise is thus described by a quantum operation  @xcite , i.e. , a completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map @xmath10 , that acts on a single - qubit density matrix @xmath11 as @xmath12 we will consider the noisy channel to be fully characterized , meaning that @xmath13 is known and without loss of generality in the range @xmath14 .",
    "we will choose the two initial states to be oriented in such a way that their distinguishability , as measured by their trace distance , is maintained under the action of the noise .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this condition is satisfied by the states @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",

    ", the dephasing noise acting on these states has the effect of decreasing the @xmath24-component of their bloch vectors .",
    "the trace distance between these two states , given by the euclidean distance between their bloch vectors , is invariant under this dephasing noise .",
    "we now consider whether there exists a control procedure @xmath25 ( some `` black box '' ) that can correct the state of this system and counteract the noise , at least to some degree , independent of which input state was prepared . to quantify the performance of any such procedure",
    ", we will use the average fidelity to compare the noiseless input states @xmath26 with the corrected output states @xmath27 . assuming an equal probability for sending either state @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the figure of merit is @xmath28 where the fidelity between a pure state @xmath4 and a mixed state @xmath11 is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "the fidelity @xmath30 ranges from 0 to 1 and is a measure of how much two states overlap each other ( a fidelity of 0 means the states are orthogonal , whereas a fidelity of 1 means the states are identical ) .",
    "it has the following simple operational meaning when the input state is pure : the fidelity @xmath31 is the probability that the state @xmath27 will yield outcome @xmath26 from the projective measurement @xmath32 .    thus , the aim is to find a control operation , described by a cptp map @xmath25 independent of the choice of initial state , such that the corrected states @xmath33 \\,,\\ ] ] for @xmath34 are close to the original states as quantified by the average fidelity .",
    "we consider control operations that consist of two steps : a measurement on the quantum system , followed by a feedback operation that is conditioned on the measurement result , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce two types of control schemes for this task , both of which are based on classical concepts , and we calculate the performance of these schemes based on the average fidelity . in sec .  [",
    "sec : quantum ] , we will introduce a quantum control scheme that outperforms both of these classical schemes .",
    "for the control of classical systems , it is always advantageous to acquire as much information about the system as possible in order to implement the best feedback scheme . in line with this principle , a possible control strategy would be to perform a measurement on the system which attempts to discriminate between the input states , and then to reprepare the system in some state based on the measurement result .",
    "we first characterize all possible discriminate - and - reprepare schemes ; such schemes are associated with _",
    "entanglement breaking trace preserving _ ( ebtp ) maps  @xcite , as follows .",
    "any discrimination step is described by a generalized measurement , ( or positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) )  @xcite yielding a classical probability distribution .",
    "the generalized measurement is described by the operators @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "the name arises because the output system is unentangled with any other system , regardless of its input state .",
    "in fact it is straightforward to see from  @xcite that all ebtp maps can be realised by some discriminate - and - reprepare scheme .",
    "thus these ebtp maps formalize our notion of discriminate - and - reprepare strategies .",
    "the measurement for discriminating two ( possibly mixed ) preparations given by helstrom  @xcite is optimal in terms of maximizing the average probability of a success . for our choice of states , helstrom s measurement is a projective measurement onto the basis @xmath46 , which successfully discriminates the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 with probability @xmath47 .",
    "note that because of the particular choice of dephasing noise , this success probability is independent of the noise strength @xmath13 .",
    "we now present and analyse two possible discriminate - and - reprepare strategies , both of which are based on helstrom s measurement .      with the outcome of helstrom s measurement ,",
    "one strategy is to reprepare the qubit in either state @xmath0 or @xmath1 based on this measurement outcome .",
    "this scheme yields an average fidelity of @xmath48 such a replacement ignores the fact that the discrimination step can fail , with probability @xmath49 , in which case a prepared state @xmath0 would be reprepared as @xmath1 ( or vice versa ) .",
    "we can consider other strategies that reprepare different states so as to reduce the effect of the aforementioned error .",
    "in particular , we now demonstrate that the following pair of states maximises the average fidelity : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "note that this replacement is also independent of @xmath13 .",
    "here , @xmath52 is prepared if the measurement outcome corresponds to @xmath0 , and @xmath53 is prepared otherwise . in this strategy ,",

    "this optimization was performed ( in a different setting ) by fuchs and sasaki  @xcite . in the appendix",

    ".      another control strategy would be to do nothing to correct the states . although trivial , this strategy is of interest for comparison with other schemes .",

    "`` do nothing ''",
    "scheme outperforms the optimal `` discriminate and reprepare '' scheme .",
    "in the previous section , we presented control schemes based on classical concepts .",
    "however , using techniques that may lead to optimal control schemes for a classical system may not necessarily lead to optimal schemes for a quantum system .",
    "as we will now demonstrate , the above classical control strategies can be outperformed by using a strategy based on quantum concepts .",
    "we note that the two classical schemes presented in the previous section lie at the extreme ends of a spectrum : the `` discriminate - and - reprepare '' strategy achieved maximum information gain and induced a maximum disturbance , whereas the `` do - nothing '' strategy achieved zero disturbance but produced zero information gain . as demonstrated by fuchs and",
    "peres  @xcite , there exist an entire range of generalized measurements that trade off information gain and disturbance .",
    "a possible avenue for improvement in our control schemes is to tailor the measurement in such a way as to find a compromise , if one exists , between acquiring information about the noise but not disturbing the system too much as a result of the measurement .    in the following",
    "we re - express the noise process @xmath10 in a way that suggests a strategy for constructing such an improved feedback protocol .      to develop an intuitive picture , we will make use of a _ preferred ensemble _ for the quantum operation @xmath10 describing the noise .",
    "that is , we use a decomposition of the operation into different kraus ( error ) operators than that given in eq .",

    "consider the following quantum operation on a qubit , viewed on the bloch sphere : with probability @xmath64 , the bloch vector of the qubit is rotated by an angle @xmath65 about the @xmath21-axis , and with probability @xmath64 it is rotated by @xmath66 about the @xmath21-axis .",
    "rotations about the @xmath21-axis are described by the operator @xmath67 and the quantum operation is then @xmath68 thus , this quantum operation is equivalent to the dephasing noise @xmath10 , with @xmath69 .",
    "viewing the noise operation @xmath10 with this preferred ensemble , it is possible to describe the noise as rotating the bloch vector of the state by @xmath70 with equal probability . a possible control strategy , then , would be to attempt to acquire information about the direction of rotation ( @xmath71 ) via an appropriate measurement , and then to _ correct _ the system based on this estimate .",
    "loosely , we desire a measurement that determines whether the noise rotated the state one way ( @xmath65 ) or another ( @xmath66 ) . then",
    ", based on the measurement result , we apply feedback : a unitary operation ( rotation ) that takes the state of the system back to the desired axis .",
    "a projective measurement , wherein the state of the system collapses to an eigenstate of the measurement , does not meet these requirements because such a measurement destroys the distinguishability of the two possible states .",
    "instead , we consider the use of a _ weak _ measurement , with a measurement strength chosen to balance the competing goals of acquiring information and leaving the system undisturbed .",
    "we now show that such a strategy is possible , and that there is a non - trivial optimal measurement strength for this task .      for our quantum control scheme",

    "we refer the reader to the appendix for a more constructive proof of this result .",
    "we have shown how two key characteristics of quantum physics  that non - orthogonal states can not be perfectly discriminated , and that any information gain via measurement necessarily implies disturbance to the system  imply that classical strategies for control must be modified or abandoned when dealing with quantum systems . by making use of more general measurements available in quantum mechanics , we can design quantum control strategies that outperform schemes based on classical concepts .",
    "in particular , we have presented a task for which the optimal scheme relies on a non - trivial measurement strength , one that balances a tradeoff between information gain and disturbance .    in constructing our quantum control scheme for the particular task presented here , we made use of several intuitive guides .",
    "first , we used a preferred ( and non - standard ) ensemble of the dephasing noise operator ( eq .  ( [ eq : preferredensemble ] ) ) , which allowed us to view the noise as `` kicking '' the state of the qubit in one direction or the other on the bloch sphere .",
    "we then made use of a weak measurement in a basis that , loosely , attempted to acquire information about the direction of this kick without acquiring information about the choice of preparation of the system .",
    "it is remarkable ( and perhaps simply lucky ) that these intuitive guides lead to a quantum control scheme that was optimal for the task .",
    "it is interesting to consider whether such intuition can be applied to quantum control schemes in general , and if this intuition can be formalized into rules for developing optimal control schemes .",
    "while our scheme is indeed optimal for the task presented , it is not guaranteed to be unique ; in fact , there are other decompositions of the same cptp map into different measurements and feedback procedures  @xcite . in general , it is possible that an entire class of cptp maps may yield the optimal performance .",
    "also , the intuitive guides discussed above for our quantum control scheme  such as that the measurement essentially gains information only about the noise and not the choice of initial state  may not apply to other optimal schemes .",
    "in connection to this , we note that a similar feedback control scheme was investigated by niu and griffiths  @xcite for optimal eavesdropping in a b92 quantum cryptography protocol  @xcite , see also  @xcite . in their scheme ,",
    "the aim of the weak measurement was to _ maximize _ the information gain about which of two non - orthogonal states was transmitted for a given amount of disturbance ; in contrast , our weak measurement was designed to acquire _ no _ information about the choice of non - orthogonal states . despite these opposing aims , the obvious similarity between these our scheme and that of niu and griffith warrants further investigation , particularly since we note that optimal feedback protocols exist based on different choices of measurement .",
    "finally , we note that the key element to our quantum control scheme  weak qnd measurements on a qubit , and feedback onto a qubit based on measurement results  have both been demonstrated in recent single - photon quantum optics experiments .",
