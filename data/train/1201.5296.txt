    "studies of extragalactic star clusters have experienced a major step forward with the availability of the _ hubble space telescope _ , which provided the spatial resolution necessary to identify clusters in distant galaxies and resolve those in nearby galaxies into individual stars , and large ground - based telescopes , which provide the light - gathering power to study these faint objects spectroscopically .",
    "the study of extragalactic gcs has provided important clues to the process of galaxy assembly and complements the direct study of high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "star clusters also provide important tests of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models constructed via population synthesis methods .",
    "although the evidence is now overwhelming that globular clusters are not single - age , single - metallicity populations as previously believed ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are still less complex than the population mix found in even the smallest galaxies . as such",
    ", they provide important observational tests for population synthesis models , and there have been many examples of such tests @xcite .",
    "although becoming increasingly important in the study of nearby stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and having the advantage of reduced extinction sensitivity , the model predictions at mid - infrared wavelengths @xmath5  @xmath6 m , have not been well - tested .",

    "the atlas9 model atmospheres , on which many population synthesis models are at least partly based , have line opacity spectra calculated to a maximum wavelength of 10  .",
    "modeling infrared stellar spectra with a rayleigh - jeans law is quite common ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is `` clearly a crude approximation '' @xcite .",
    "those authors state that bolometric corrections for the coolest stars are uncertain by up to a few tenths of a magnitude . in their investigation on the use of model atmospheres for infrared calibration , @xcite found that model spectra are accurate to 3% in the mid - ir but also noted that `` for the purpose of calculating theoretical spectra in the mid to far - ir , some line lists are still far from complete or accurate '' .    the _ spitzer _ space telescope probes these mid - infrared wavelengths . while young star clusters have been the subject of numerous investigations with _ spitzer _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there has been relatively little analysis of the mid - infrared properties of old star clusters .",
    "old star clusters declining spectral energy distribution in the mid - infrared , in combination with the presumed lack of interesting spectral features , is presumably the reason for this lack of attention .",
    "mid - infrared observations have been used in studies of mass - losing stars in individual clusters @xcite as well as searches for cold dust in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "one of the few studies of extragalactic globular cluster systems is that of @xcite .",
    "the present paper provides mid - infrared photometry of massive globular clusters in the andromeda galaxy , , taken with the _",

    "m31 clusters are generally too faint to be detected in the mips observations of @xcite , and photometry of the handful of milky way clusters observed with the mips instrument is published elsewhere @xcite .    throughout this work we use the vega magnitude system and assume a distance to m31 of 780  kpc @xcite , for which 1  corresponds to 3.78  pc .",
    "star clusters contain a limited number of stars and photometry of star clusters must consider stochastic effects @xcite .",
    "the integrated light of a cluster can be dominated by a few bright stars , particularly in the infrared where the luminosity of the asymptotic giant branch is highest @xcite .",
    "for this first comparison of star cluster photometry with ssp models in the mid - infrared , we wanted to avoid stochastic effects as much as possible , so we sought to select only the most massive clusters .",
    "one criterion for choosing a selection limit is the lowest luminosity limit ( lll ) defined by @xcite .",

    "we used this result to set our lower mass limit at @xmath21  m@xmath9 .",
    "for this first comparison between ssp models and star cluster colors , we wanted to remove age as a variable if possible , and select only old clusters .",
    "the clusters we considered all belong to the milky way , m31 , or the lmc . while many other local group dwarf galaxies have a few globular clusters each ( see the compilation by * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite noted that deriving m31 cluster ages from integrated spectroscopy can be problematic .",

    "it is possible that some younger clusters could be lurking in the sample , although we considered only m31 clusters that had not been identified as young by any previous work .",
    "there are a number of methods for estimating the total mass of a star cluster . while velocity dispersions either from integrated spectra or spectra of individual stars provide the most direct measurements of the gravitational potential of a cluster , such measurements are not available for many local group star clusters , particularly in m31 which has the largest population .",
    "a more widely - applicable method involves measuring the total luminosity and multiplying by a mass - to - light ratio .",
    "total luminosity can be measured by either large - aperture photometry or fitting and extrapolation of a surface brightness profile . for m31 clusters ,",
    "a comprehensive set of mass estimates is available in the work of @xcite , who estimated masses by multiplying reddening - corrected @xmath1-band luminosities ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by @xmath25 . with the goal of selecting a uniform sample ,",
    "we used these mass estimates exclusively to select the final m31 sample ; a few additional outlying clusters for which masses were not given by @xcite but which have mass estimates in their online catalog ( g001 , b358 , mgc-1 , b468 , b293 ) were also included .",
    "for milky way and lmc clusters , we used near - infrared @xmath26-band magnitudes as given by @xcite and @xcite . the near - infrared",
    "is often used as an indicator of stellar mass in studies of external galaxies since it is expected to be dominated by low - mass stars and is not strongly sensitive to recent star formation @xcite .",
    "the clusters magnitude were converted to luminosities using @xmath27 @xcite and multiplied by @xmath28 in solar units , the lower end of the range quoted for single - metallicity populations by @xcite .",
    "we also considered cluster masses derived from fitting of optical surface brightness profiles by @xcite ; these masses are primarily derived from @xmath1-band observations ( corrected for extinction ) and assume @xmath29 @xcite . some milky way clusters ( particularly core - collapse candidates ) are missing from the @xcite database .",

    "the lmc clusters ngc  1916 is located near a region of diffuse emission , making background subtraction for this cluster extremely difficult .",
    "irac photometry of a larger sample of lmc clusters has been reported by @xcite .",

    "saturation limits for irac images with these frametimes are in the range @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the brightest gcs in m31 have @xmath35 @xcite , so saturation of the clusters was not expected to be an issue .",

    "cluster b095 is located about 7  from a much brighter star and is contaminated by detector artifacts due to the star ; we judged that obtaining reliable photometry in the irac bands was not possible .",

    "while this is smaller than the full - width at half - maximum of the irac point spread function ( psf ) , it is large enough that m31 gcs appear slightly resolved ( see figure  [ fig : m31_img ] ) .",
    "aperture photometry is thus more appropriate for these objects than psf - fitting photometry .",

    "aperture photometry was performed using the iraf / apphot package .",
    "flux was measured in circular apertures of radii 366 ( and 122 for the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath6 m   bands only ) , with background measured in an annulus of inner and outer radii 3685 ( 146244 ) subtracted .",
    "this background annulus for the small aperture is the smaller of two tabulated in the instrument handbook .",

    "calibration to the vega system was made using the vega irac - band flux densities given by the spitzer science center .",

    ", we retrieved 2mass images of the m31 gcs and used these to measure aperture magnitudes with the same large photometric and background apertures used for the irac data .",
    "we chose to use the large apertures rather than trying to match the spatial resolution between irac and 2mass because the temporal variation in the 2mass psf makes any such matching significantly more complicated .",
    "the photometric uncertainties were estimated using the same procedure as for the irac magnitudes , which is based on the procedure detailed in section 8av of the 2mass all - sky data release explanatory supplement .",
    "table  [ tab : gcphot ] gives the 2mass @xmath26 photometry .",
    "we compared our aperture photometry with the total magnitudes measured on ukirt images by @xcite .",
    "the ukirt magnitudes are slightly fainter , with the median offset @xmath43  mag .",
    "this is not too surprising , since we used an aperture slightly larger than most of the apertures used by @xcite .",
    "it could result in our ` total ' @xmath26 magnitudes being slightly too bright ; however for the purposes of computing 2mass - to - irac colors this effect should cancel out .    while extinction has a much smaller effect on photometry in the mid - infrared than in visible - light or even the near - infrared , the effect is not completely negligible .",
    "the exact shape of the extinction law in the mid - infrared appears to vary with position in the galaxy @xcite but all of these analyses agree that the extinction at irac wavelengths is greater than would be expected from a power - law extrapolation of the near - infrared extinction curve . in the analysis that follows , we correct the cluster colors for extinction using the @xmath44 values given by @xcite .",
    "these values include both foreground extinction and extinction internal to m31 . for this analysis we use the bandpass - averaged extinction values of @xcite , as tabulated in @xcite : @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the other three irac bands .",

    "galev also provides chemically consistent modeling of galaxies while the other two do not , although this difference is not relevant for the present study .",
    "population synthesis models have mostly focused on the visible - light regime , so it is reasonable to ask what the input ingredients of these models are in the infrared .",
    "the treatment of red giant and asymptotic giant branch stars is expected to be particularly important , since these evolutionary stages dominate the light of old populations , especially in the near - infrared ( * ? ? ?",

    "basel is based mainly on the stellar atmosphere models of @xcite , but those models do not include the coolest stars , so basel also includes model m giant atmospheres from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the padova ssp models use some of the same input ingredients  newer atlas models from @xcite and the @xcite models  but without going through the basel library .",

    "we think this is unlikely : deriving ages from mid - ir model predictions and colors alone ( clearly a risky idea given the limited age sensitivity shown in figure  [ fig : mod_age ] ) would suggest ages younger than 2  gyr .",
    "such young ages would have a substantial effect on optical and near - infrared colors , and there are no suggestions from recent spectroscopic or sed - fitting studies of m31 clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the brightest clusters are all so young .",
    "3 .   reddening corrections could play a role : the metal - rich clusters have a higher average reddening than the metal - poor clusters , so if the @xmath44 estimates of @xcite were too high , the corrected colors of metal - rich clusters would be more strongly affected .",
    "as an example , we found that reducing the reddening values of all clusters by 20% brought the data points and models into better agreement over the entire metallicity range.infrared colors is in @xmath62 and there is no strong evidence that m31 has a different value of @xmath63 . ] 4 .",
    "all three model families could have some common flaw in the spectral libraries that causes them to predict too much infrared flux , or too little @xmath1-band .",
    "some ssp models are known to have problems reproducing globular cluster colors in the infrared ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) , so a problem with the less - well - calibrated irac bands seems plausible .",
    "5 .   finally , the results of @xcite on the mass - to - light ratios for m31 clusters suggest an interesting alternative .",
    "those authors found @xmath64 to be lower for metal - rich m31 clusters than for metal - poor clusters , contrary to predictions from ssp models . while younger populations are expected to have lower @xmath64 , @xcite argued against the metal - rich m31 clusters being even intermediate - age , and concluded that variations in the cluster mass function , either initially or through dynamical evolution , were more likely explanations . a flatter mass function , required to match the mass - to - light ratios , should qualitatively also result in bluer predicted colors : fewer low - mass stars would mean less @xmath1-band light ( dominated by the main sequence ) , and more high - mass stars should mean more infrared light ( dominated by giants ) .",
    "the different initial mass functions available in the ssp models do not result in large differences in predicted colors , but perhaps more drastic alterations to the mass function would change colors more dramatically .",
    "we consider the last three of these options to be more plausible explanations of the offset .",
    "distinguishing between them requires better - quality data than are currently available .",
    "if we assume that the model - data offset in @xmath65infrared colors is due to a systematic problem in the models , we can still use our data to explore the metallicity sensitivity of these colors .",
    "we performed least - squares fits of color as a function of metallicity , weighted by the color uncertainty .",
    "for the clusters binned in metallicity , we found slopes in the range 0.420.46 for all three colors , very close to the value of 0.409 derived by @xcite for @xmath4 in milky way globular clusters .",
    "for the full , unbinned m31 sample we derive a slope of 0.39 for @xmath4 . for this sample",
    "we derive somewhat steeper slopes of 0.68 for @xmath2 $ ] and 0.59 for @xmath3 $ ] , still shallower than the slope of 0.90 derived by @xcite , although those authors were fitting the reverse function ( metallicity as a function of color ) .",
    "the steeper slopes for the unbinned data agree better with the general trend of the models .",
    "of course , there is no guarantee that a linear fit is the correct representation of the actual physical situation ( and see * ? ? ? * ) , but the scatter visible in figure  [ fig : opt_col_met ] indicates that a more complicated fit is not likely to be meaningful .",
    "the slopes of the linear fits indicate that @xmath66 colors could be a useful metallicity indicator for simple stellar populations .",
    "the low infrared background seen by _",
    "spitzer _ means that irac observations to comparable depth can be made much more quickly than ground - based near - infrared observations ; however compared to @xmath4 , @xmath66 colors have the disadvantage of being somewhat more sensitive to reddening uncertainties and having ( typically ) poorer spatial resolution . echoing @xcite , we caution that these colors are not well - calibrated for super - solar or very low ( @xmath61\\lesssim -1.9 $ ] ) metallicities . using the m31 clusters to calibrate",
    "the relation would require careful matching of apertures in photometric bands differing by almost a factor of 10 in wavelength ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the difficulties involved in matching just between visible and near - infrared ) and is not a trivial task even for these bright clusters .",
    "using more distant , unresolved clusters to calibrate the visible - to - irac color / metallicity relation might be a better approach .",
    "we have presented mid - infrared photometry of massive globular clusters in m31 , in order to test the color predictions of population synthesis models . to our knowledge , this is the first such test of the models in all four irac bands .",
    "the three different model families discussed here differ somewhat in their predicted colors and in the systematic effects of age and metallicity .",
    "as might be expected , models including circumstellar dust emission predict redder colors , particularly at longer wavelengths , and more color variability with age , particularly for ages @xmath54  gyr . except for the @xmath55-[8.0]$ ]",
    "color , the exact choice of circumstellar dust prescription does not make a substantial difference .",
    "the present level of observational precision does not permit distinguishing between models ; the considerable observational uncertainties , especially at the longer wavelengths , are due to the bright background from the galaxy and the falling cluster spectral energy distribution . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the data and models are mostly in agreement .",
    "we find a small but not statistically significant offset between models and data in the @xmath0-[5.8]$ ] color ; if real , this could be an indication of emission from circumstellar dust in some clusters .",
    "finally , we find that visible - to - irac colors are bluer than model predictions , for reasons which are unclear .",
