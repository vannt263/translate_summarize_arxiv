    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) emit large amounts of energy across the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum , so obtaining panchromatic data allows a more thorough investigation of the processes involved . even with the rapid slewing capability of _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) , few bursts have good , simultaneous multi - band observations of the prompt emission . on rare occasions , a trigger on a precursor has allowed the xrt and uvot ( x - ray telescope and uv / optical telescope ; burrows et al . 2005a ; roming et al .",

    "however , it is only the gas at @xmath47 0 km  s@xmath30 ( i.e.  @xmath48 ) that shows significant absorption from fine - structure levels of the siii , cii and oi ions / atoms .",
    "absorption from these fine - structure levels ( e.g. siii@xmath49 1264 ) is a strong signature of gas near the grb afterglow because the afterglow itself is the excitation mechanism ( prochaska , chen & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , we are inclined to associate the grb with the redshift of this material . under this hypothesis , the gas at v @xmath39 + 700  km  s@xmath30 might be considered a neighbouring galaxy with a very large , positive peculiar velocity .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that the gas at v @xmath39 + 700  km  s@xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) marks the ambient interstellar medium of the host galaxy and that the material at v  @xmath39  0  km  s@xmath30 is due to a fast outflow of material near the grb afterglow .",
    "this hypothesis is challenged by the fast wind speed required and the absence of fine - structure absorption in the siii and cii gas at v  @xmath39 + 770  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "an emission - line measurement of the host galaxy would be required to resolve these two possibilities and so we infer @xmath51 .",
    "independent of the correct interpretation of the two systems , we can draw a few conclusions about the gas associated with grb  080810 .",
    "first , the total hi column is low relative to the mean value observed in grb afterglow spectra ( jakobsson et al .",
    "for both ly@xmath43 lines we set a conservative upper limit of n@xmath52 @xmath29 based on the absence of strong damping wings .",
    "we also place a lower limit to the column density of the @xmath53 absorber of n@xmath54 @xmath29 based on lyman limit absorption at @xmath55 .",
    "both systems show relatively weak low - ion absorption , consistent with the low n@xmath56 values .",
    "in contrast , each shows very strong high - ion absorption , a characterstic of gas associated with grb host galaxies ( prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ) . in agreement with this optical measurement , no absorption above the galactic value was required when fitting the x - ray spectrum ( section  [ sec : x ] ) .",
    "we note in passing that grbs  020813 ( barth et al . 2003 ) and 021004 ( fynbo et al . 2005 ) both showed similarly unusual absorption systems .",
    "ryde ( 2005 ) and ryde & peer ( 2009 ) discuss the possibility that thermal emission may be ubiquitous in grbs , fitting samples of spectra with a power - law - plus - blackbody model , and lazzati et al .",
    "( 2009 ) present simulations of photospheric emission .",
    "such thermal components may explain the hard early - time spectra which are inconsistent with synchrotron emission ( preece et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini , celotti & lazzati 2000 ; savchenko & neronov 2009 ) .",
    "a similar quasithermal model was applied to the grb  080810 gamma - ray spectra and the results are included in table  [ jointfit ] . in most of the spectra presented by ryde & peer ( 2009 )",
    "a distinct break is seen in the temporal evolution of the blackbody temperature ; this is not apparent in our data , though this may be related to the fact that our first spectrum spans t@xmath20  +  010  s , and most of the breaks seen occur within ten seconds of the burst .",
    "following peer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we have estimated the photospheric radius ( the radius beyond which the outflow becomes optically thin ) to be @xmath4  2  @xmath6  10@xmath57  y@xmath20  cm , where y@xmath20 is the ratio between the fireball energy and the energy emitted in gamma - rays ( 1@xmath58  y@xmath20  @xmath59  35 ; see peer et al .",
    "we also determine that the coasting lorentz factor is @xmath4  570y@xmath60 .",
    "these calculations assume that the blackbody temperature is the maximum measured ( 62 kev ) , since we do not see a break in the behaviour of the temperature .",
    "the ratio of the blackbody flux to the total flux over the gamma - ray band ( 1010@xmath61  kev ) is 0.2 for this spectrum . with the exception of the spectrum after 100  s , where the blackbody is much weaker and cooler",
    ", this ratio remains between 0.10.2 for the spectra considered here .",
    "we do point out , however , that the fits systematically have a worse @xmath62 than the cut - off power - law models .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ gamma ] shows the joint bat - xrt flux light - curve .",
    "the data were converted into 0.310  kev fluxes using power - law fits to time - sliced spectra ; where there were simultaneous bat and xrt detections , the spectra were fitted jointly .",
    "the figure also shows how the bat and xrt hardness ratios and spectra evolve over time .",
    "a general softening trend can be seen across both bands , though the data harden during the flares , as is typical ( e.g. , golenetskii et al . 1983 ; ford et al . 1995 ; borgonovo & ryde 2001 ; goad et al .",
    "2007 ; page et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this softening with time likely explains why there was no significant gamma - ray emission detected at the time of the second large flare seen by the xrt , just after t@xmath20 + 200  s.    the flare around 100  s was detected over both gamma - ray ( bat and gbm ) and x - ray bands , though ; as mentioned in section  [ sec : opt ] , there is only a slight hint of an increase in the uvot @xmath33 magnitude at this same time . extracting and fitting simultaneous bat and xrt spectra demonstrates that there is curvature between the @xmath11-ray and x - ray bands ; this is also shown by the differences in the independent power - law fits shown in figure  [ gamma ] .",
    "broken power - law models are preferred for spectra from both the rising and falling portions of the flare .",
    "the break energy is not well - constrained in either case , but is located towards the top end of the xrt bandpass ( between @xmath4310  kev ) .    instead of using a series of broken power - laws to fit grb light - curves , an alternative method was proposed by obrien et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and willingale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) : the light - curve is parametrized by one or two components each comprising an early exponential rise which then rolls over into a power - law decay .",
    "the first of these components accounts for the gamma - ray and early x - ray emission ( the ` prompt ' phase ) , while the second ( which is not always seen ",
    "see figure 2 of willingale et al .",
    "2007 ) forms what we typically see as the afterglow at later times .",
    "these components allow an intrinsically curved light - curve to be fitted without relying on a series of abrupt breaks in a power - law model . excluding the times where the flares are seen ,",
    "this exponential - to - power - law model can easily account for the bat - xrt light - curve of grb  080810 .",
    "the second , ` afterglow ' component begins to dominate in the interval 5003500  s , between the end of the first and beginning of the second orbit of data .",
    "the optical data can also be modelled with the exponential - to - power - law combination . using this model ,",
    "the afterglow e@xmath63 was calculated to be 1.6  @xmath6  10@xmath10  erg , approximately a tenth of the prompt e@xmath63 ( section  [ sec : gamma ] ) .",
    "as for the prompt measurement , this is also high , compared with typical values of 10@xmath64 for afterglows",
    "( willingale et al . 2007 ) .",
    "figure  [ fdlc ] brings together all the photometric data considered in this paper , from the gamma - ray regime to radio wavelengths . the gamma - ray and x - ray light - curves have been converted to flux densities by assuming simple power - law fits ( changing over time where there is evidence for spectral evolution ) .",
    "note that all light - curves except the x - ray and radio points have been vertically offset from their actual positions , to avoid over - lap and make the plot clearer .",
    "the early high - energy photon index evolves from harder to softer , as indicated by the fact that the fermi ( 81000  kev data from the summed nai detectors , normalised to 100  kev ) and bat data extend till @xmath4  100  s , while the softer , 1  kev xrt data show apparent prompt emission out to at least 400  s ; at this time _",
    "swift _ entered the south atlantic anomaly and so stopped collecting data for the remainder of the orbit .",
    "the exponential - to - power - law model fits ( obrien et al .",
    "2006 ; willingale et al .",
    "2007 ) to the bat , xrt and @xmath35-band data are shown as solid lines in the figure , with the dotted sections showing the continuation of these models beyond the extent of the data .",
    "the model jointly fitted to the bat - xrt data ( with the bat data extrapolated to 1  kev ) is also shown as the higher dotted blue line ; the 20  kev magenta line is the same model ( though with a different normalisation ) as the joint bat - xrt fit .",
    "each optical band is initially consistent with the same slope ( @xmath65  =  1.22  @xmath1  0.09 when the power - law decay takes over ) , with slightly different normalisations between the filters .",
    "note that the second of the radio points is only a marginal detection , at the 2.4@xmath37 level .",
    "the second component fitted to the x - ray and optical profiles also contains an exponential rise .",
    "such an increase is usually assumed because the second component is expected to turn on some time after the prompt trigger ; however , in this burst , the early @xmath35-band points actually show an initial increase , peaking at @xmath4  100  s after the trigger , and provide us with a method of fitting the turn - on of the afterglow . with only three or four points between the initial rotse detection and the peak of the optical emission , however , quantifing the speed of the rise would be over - interpreting the data .",
    "we do not have a detailed theoretical model for the onset of the afterglow with which to compare the data .",
    "it is possible that part of the rise seen could be caused by spectral evolution ( that is , the passage of the peak of the spectrum through the bandpass ) , although it is reasonable to assume that we are mainly seeing an increase in peak flux as the external ( afterglow ) shock begins and strengthens , @xmath4  30  s after the burst .",
    "the vertical dotted lines mark four times at which spectral energy distributions ( seds ) have been created ( figure  [ sed ] ) : t@xmath66 , at 50  s after the trigger , is during the prompt phase , where fermi , bat and rotse - iii data are available ; t@xmath67 is the time at which the prompt and afterglow model fits are equal in x - ray flux ( @xmath4  600  s after the trigger ) ; t@xmath68 indicates the time at which the power - law decay starts in the x - ray band ( @xmath4  8  ks ) ; t@xmath69 is the point around which we have x - ray , optical and radio measurements ( shortly before @xmath4  300  ks ) .",
    "the optical flux values in figure  [ sed ] have been corrected for the lyman forest absorption ( curran et al .",
    "2008b ) and the x - ray data corrected for the hydrogen column .",
    "the error bars on the optical points are smaller than the markers plotted .",
    "the first sed , at t@xmath66 , is a distinctly different shape from the later , afterglow - dominated plots .",
    "the prompt spectrum is shown as a cut - off power - law ( see table  [ jointfit ] ) with the extension below the x - ray band shown by the curved dotted line , indicating that we assume this component peaks somewhere between the optical and x - ray bands since , as can be seen in figure  [ fdlc ] , the optical emission at this time is totally dominated by the afterglow component .",
    "the power - law dotted line from the optical band at this time is parallel to the optical - x - ray slope at t@xmath67  i.e. , it represents the afterglow component .",
    "there is no evidence for a prompt optical flash ( caused by reverse shock emission ) , since this should be brighter than an extrapolation of the ( forward shock ) x - ray spectrum .",

    "it seems likely that these events are part of the same population as grbs with prompt optical detections , but are at the faint end of the distribution .",

    ", we note that granot , ramirez - ruiz & perna ( 2005 ) find that a structured jet could lead to a steeper decay in the optical than in the x - ray  the opposite of the measurements for grb  080810 . using the standard fireball closure relationships ( e.g. , zhang & m ' esz ' aros 2004 ) , the optical data at this time are consistent with a wind medium undergoing slow cooling , with @xmath86  @xmath59  @xmath19  @xmath59  @xmath87 . in this case , @xmath43  =  ( 3@xmath18 + 1)/2 =  [ ( 3  @xmath6  0.51 )  +  1]/2  =  1.27 , compared to the measured value of @xmath65  @xmath4  1.22 .    the most straightforward way to explain",
    "this difference in the x - ray and optical behaviour is to have the cooling break moving towards higher frequencies ( i.e. moving from the optical towards the x - ray ) .",
    "if the blastwave is indeed moving through a wind medium , then the cooling break is expected to increase with time as t@xmath88 . this would , however , necessitate a transition from a wind to a homogeneous medium for the break then to move down to lower frequencies ( see later ) , which would lead to a change in the optical decay which is not clearly seen .",
    "an alternative explanation for the movement of the cooling break to higher energies is energy injection . using the equations for the luminosity index , @xmath89 , given by zhang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we find that this part of the decay is indeed consistent with energy injection ( that is , @xmath89  @xmath59  0 )",
    ". the approximate frequency of this cooling break is marked by a star in figure  [ sed ] ; it can not be determined accurately because of the lack of constraint on the optical index , but lies within the range 10@xmath5  2  @xmath6  10@xmath7  hz .",
    "@xmath90 data from osn at 50  ks after the trigger ( the closest measurements were taken and then extrapolated to this exact time by using the slope of the light - curve ) provide a spectral slope of @xmath83  =  0.98  @xmath1  0.38 , consistent with the x - ray data ; this confirms that the cooling break has passed through the optical frequencies by t@xmath69 and the data are consistent with the relevant closure relation [ @xmath43  =  ( 3@xmath18 - 1)/2 for @xmath19  @xmath75  @xmath87 ] within the uncertainties . as the cooling break moves through the optical band",
    ", we would expect to see a change in slope of the light - curve ; however , we do not have sufficient coverage or statistical precision at this late time to confirm or deny such a break .",
    "furthermore , such a change in slope is likely to be spread over a decade in time , since the spectral break is a smooth , rather than abrupt , transition . with no radio index and the lack of measurements between the optical and radio regimes , it is not possible to say where the peak of the spectrum lies .",
    "the star again marks an approximate position for the break , although we note that there will be multiple breaks in this part of the spectrum , corresponding to this cooling break , the peak frequency and the synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "he radio data are consistent with the extrapolation of a synchrotron spectrum from the optical and x - ray bands , though .",
    "the optical spectral measurements are quite poorly constrained , both at early and late times and , within the errors , @xmath83 could be consistent with a constant value from t@xmath69 to t@xmath68 .",
    "we also note that the x - ray data during the power - law decay ( @xmath82  =  1.00  @xmath1  0.09 and @xmath85  =  1.81  @xmath1  0.20 ) are not consistent with being above @xmath87 ( specifically , the temporal slope is too steep and is , in fact , steeper than is typical for a pre - jet - break slope ; see , e.g. , evans et al .",
    "2009 ) , indicating the decay may not be goverened by the standard fireball model ( e.g. , rees & m ' esz ' aros 1992 ; m ' esz ' aros & rees 1994 ; m ' esz ' aros & rees 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) with a single synchrotron emission component .",
    "this lack of agreement with the standard fireball model appears to be the case for a growing number of afterglows , with many bursts for which we have good , multi - wavelength data presenting challenges which still need to be accounted for ( e.g. , willingale et al .",

    "there is no evidence for a jet break ( rhoads 1999 ) in the data out to at least six days ( which is within the range of _ swift _ jet break times discussed by racusin et al .",
    "this places a limit on the jet opening angle of @xmath92  @xmath75  4@xmath24 ( sari , piran & halpern 1999 ; frail et al .",

    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) typically starts with a steep decay , with @xmath43  @xmath4  3 , which is generally attributed to off - axis emission , often referred to as the ` curvature effect ' ( fenimore , madras & nayakshin 1996 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ; dermer 2004 ) .",
    "however , the early x - ray light - curve of grb  080810 shows a significantly slower decline , with @xmath43  @xmath4  1 .",
    "in fact , the beginning of the grb  080810 light - curve is very similar to that of grb  060607a ( ziaeepour et al .",
    "2008 ; molinari et al .",
    "2007 ) , both in x - rays and the optical : x - ray flares , superimposed on a relatively slow decline , while the optical emission rises smoothly , independently of the variability seen by the xrt and bat .",
    "both bursts also show low n@xmath56",
    ". this slower - than - expected decay could be ( at least partly ) caused by repeated flaring on top of the underlying continuum .",
    "alternatively , there could be input from the x - ray afterglow ; the optical afterglow has clearly risen by this time ( with little evidence of prompt emission ; figure  [ fdlc ] ) , but the x - ray light - curve can not be fully deconvolved into the prompt and afterglow components .",
    "no plateau phase is seen in the optical data  the emission rises and then fades steadily away  which could be explained by the lack of a strong optical component during the prompt phase : from the exponential - to - power - law model , the plateau phase often seen in the x - ray may be a consequence of the bright prompt emission dominating at early times as the afterglow emission rises ( see , e.g. , page et al .",
    "2009 for an example of this ) .",
    "the final optical decay starts around 300  s , while the x - ray plateau extends to @xmath4  8  ks before the onset of the power - law decay .",
    "these findings ( the optical data showing no plateau and beginning the power - law decay phase earlier ) were also noted for grb  061121 ( page et al .",

    "zhang , kobayashi & m ' esz ' aros ( 2003 ) and jin & fan ( 2007 ) discuss the possible appearance of the reverse shock in optical light - curves .",
    "these papers consider three types of reverse shock emission : type i light - curves show both forward- and reverse - shock emission peaks ; type ii show a single peak , corresponding to the reverse shock , with a later flattening caused by the forward shock as it starts to dominate the emission ; type iii light - curves show no sign of the reverse shock , with just a single rise and fall of the optical emission .",
    "the light - curve of grb  080810 appears to be a member of this third class , with a single power - law decay seen from around 100  s until several hundred kiloseconds after the burst trigger .",
    "the synchrotron frequency , @xmath106 , at the time the reverse shock crosses the outflow is therefore very small , well below the optical band .",
    "panaitescu & vestrand ( 2008 ) found an anti - correlation between the peak optical flux and the time of the peak for fast - rising optical afterglows .",
    "k - correcting our values to the fiducial redshift of @xmath0  =  2 used by panaitescu & vestrand gives a peak time of @xmath4  85  s and a corresponding peak flux of @xmath4  94  mjy , meaning that the optical afterglow of grb  080810 is consistent with their findings .",
    "this correlation is explained by a structured outflow being seen off - axis .",
    "although the rise seen in the optical light - curve is naturally explained as the onset of the afterglow , there are other possible mechanisms  for example , off - axis or structured outflows or two - component jets ( e.g. , granot et al .",
