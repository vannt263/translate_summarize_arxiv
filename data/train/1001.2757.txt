    "solar prominences ( a.k.a .  filaments ) are relatively cool structures embedded in the million - degree corona at heights well above the chromosphere . above the solar limb , prominences appear as bright structures against the dark background , but when viewed as filaments on the solar disk they can be brighter or darker than their surroundings , depending on the bandpass used to observe them .",
    "magnetic fields are thought to play an important role in supporting the prominence plasma against gravity , and in insulating it from the surrounding hot corona .",
    "most quiescent prominences exhibit intricate filamentary structures that evolve continually due to plasma flows and heating / cooling processes . in some cases the threads appear to be mostly horizontal , while in other cases they are clearly radially oriented ( `` hedgerow '' prominences ) .",
    "figure [ fig : proms ] shows several examples of prominences observed in h@xmath2 at the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) and the dutch open telescope ( dot ) .",
    "the examples in figs .  [",
    "fig : proms]a and [ fig : proms]b show mainly vertical threads , while the prominence in fig .",
    "[ fig : proms]c shows horizontal threads .",
    "off - limb observations in he  ii 304  indicate that there are higher altitude parts that are optically thin in h@xmath2 and therefore not visible on the disk ( or at least have not been clearly identified in disk observations ) .",
    "figure [ fig : proms]d shows a prominence above the solar limb as observed in he  ii 304  with the secchi / euvi instrument on the stereo spacecraft .",
    "the upper parts of the prominence consist of vertical threads with an intricate fine - scale structure .",
    "movie sequences of quiescent and erupting prominences can be found at the stereo website .",
    "prominence plasma is highly dynamic , exhibiting horizontal and vertical motions of order 1070 km  s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution observations of filaments on the solar disk indicate that they consist of a collection of very thin threads with widths of about 200 km , at the limit of resolution of present - day telescopes @xcite .",
    "individual threads have lifetimes of only a few minutes , but the filament as a whole can live for many days .",
    "it seems likely that these thin threads are aligned with the local magnetic field .",
    "high - resolution images of prominences above the limb have been obtained with the solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard hinode .",
    "for example , @xcite observed horizontal threads in a prominence near an active region , and studied the oscillatory motions of these threads .",
    "@xcite observed a hedgerow prominence consisting of many thin vertical threads , and they used multi - wavelength observations to estimate the amount of absorption and `` emissivity blocking '' in the prominence and surrounding cavity .",
    "@xcite observed another hedgerow prominence and found that the prominence sheet is structured by both bright quasi - vertical threads and dark inclusions .",
    "the bright structures are downflow streams with velocity of about 10 km  s@xmath3 , and the dark inclusions are highly dynamic upflows with velocity of about 20 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the downflow velocities are much less than the free - fall speed , indicating that the plasma is somehow being supported against gravity .",
    "@xcite proposed that the dark plumes contain relatively hot plasma that is driven upward by buoyancy .",
    "@xcite observed a persistent flow of h@xmath2 emitting plasma into a prominence from one side , leading to the formation of vertical threads .",
    "they suggested that the vertical threads are stacks of plasma supported against gravity by the sagging of initially horizontal magnetic field lines .",
    "direct measurements of the prominence magnetic field can be obtained using spectro - polarimetry . a comprehensive effort to measure prominence magnetic fields",
    "was conducted in the 1970 s and early 1980 s using the facilities at pic du midi ( france ) and sacramento peak observatory ( usa ) .",
    "this work showed that ( 1 ) the magnetic field in quiescent prominences has a strength of 315 g ; ( 2 ) the field is mostly _ horizontal _ and makes an angle of about @xmath4 with respect to the long axis of the prominence ; ( 3 ) the field strength increases slightly with height , indicating the presence of dipped field lines ; ( 4 ) most prominences have _ inverse _ polarity , i.e. , the component of magnetic field perpendicular to the prominence axis has a direction opposite to that of the potential field .",
    "these earlier data likely included a variety of quiescent prominences , some with predominantly horizontal threads , others with more vertical threads .",
    "in more recent work , @xcite reported full - stokes observations of a limb prominence in he  i 5876  ( he  @xmath5 ) , and derived magnetic field strengths of 3045 g , somewhat larger than the values reported in earlier studies . @xcite",
    "published the first vector - field map of a prominence with a spatial resolution of a few arcseconds .",
    "they found that the average magnetic field in this prominence is mostly horizontal with a strength of about 20 g and with the magnetic vector pointing @xmath6 to @xmath7 off the prominence axis , consistent with the earlier studies .",
    "however , the map also shows clearly organized patches where the magnetic field is significantly stronger than average , up to 80 g .",
    "it is unclear how these patches are related to the fine threads seen at higher spatial resolution .",
    "recently , @xcite observed he  i 10830  in a polar crown prominence above the limb , and found evidence for fields of about 30 g that are oriented only @xmath8 from the vertical direction .",
    "how is the plasma in hedgerow prominences supported against gravity ?",
    "many authors have suggested that quiescent prominences are embedded in large - scale _ flux ropes _ that lie horizontally above the polarity inversion line .",
    "the prominence plasma is thought to be located near the _ dips _ of the helical field lines .",
    "the magnetic field near the dips may be deformed by the weight of the prominence plasma .",
    "others have suggested that the magnetic field in hedgerow prominences is vertical along the observed threads , and that the plasma is supported by mhd waves .",
    "however , relatively high frequencies and wave amplitudes are required , and it is unclear why such waves would not lead to strong heating of the prominence plasma . @xcite and @xcite showed that the prominence plasma can be supported by the pressure of a coronal plasma lower down along an inclined field line ; however , this mechanism only works for nearly horizontal field lines . furthermore , hedgerow prominences are located in coronal cavities where the plasma pressure is very low . therefore , it seems unlikely that the vertical threads seen in hedgerow prominences can be supported by coronal plasma pressure on nearly vertical field lines .    in this paper",
    "we propose that hedgerow prominences are embedded in magnetic fields with a complex `` tangled '' structure .",
    "such tangled fields have many dips in the field lines where the weight of the prominence plasma can be counteracted by upward magnetic forces .",
    "our purpose is to demonstrate that such tangled fields provide a viable mechanism for prominence support in hedgerow prominences .",
    "@xcite recently invoked tangled fields in the interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of an active region filament .",
    "while such filaments are quite different from the hedgerow prominences considered here , this work shows that tangled fields have important effects on the measurement of prominence magnetic fields .",
    "such effects will not be considered in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we propose that hedgerow prominences are supported by tangled magnetic fields , and we discuss how such fields may be formed . in section 3 we present a simple model for the dynamics of plasma along the tangled field lines , and we show that weak shock waves naturally occur in such plasmas . in section 4",
    "we develop a magnetostatic model of tangled fields based on the _ linear force - free field _",
    "approximation , and in section 5 we study the response of such fields to gravitational forces . in section 6 we simulate the distribution of plasma in a cylindrical prominence thread . in section 7 we discuss the formation of vertical threads by rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the results of the investigation are summarized and discussed in section 8 .",
    "the spectro - polarimetric observations of prominences described in section  [ sect : intro ] are consistent with the idea that quiescent prominences are embedded in coronal flux ropes that lie horizontally above the polarity inversion line ( pil )",
    ". figure  [ fig : cartoon2]a shows a vertical cross - section through such a flux rope .",
    "the magnetic field also has a component into the image plane , so the field lines are helices , and the plasma is assumed to be located at the dips of these helical windings . a dip is defined as a point where the magnetic field is locally horizontal and curved upward . as indicated in the figure , the magnetic field may be deformed by the weight of the prominence plasma , creating v - shaped dips .",
    "the magnetic field near such dips is well described by the kippenhahn - schlter model , and several authors have developed local magnetostatic models of the fine structures observed in quiescent prominences ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent observations of `` dark plumes '' and rotational motions @xcite within prominences remind us again that prominences have complex internal motions , and it is not clear how such motions can be explained in terms of a single large flux rope",
    ". perhaps the magnetic structure of hedgerow prominences is more complicated than that predicted by the flux rope model ( figure  [ fig : cartoon2]a ) .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative model , which is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon2]b .",
    "following @xcite , we suggest that hedgerow prominences are formed in current sheets that overlie certain sections of the pil on the quiet sun . unlike those previous authors we suggest that the current sheet extends only to limited height ( @xmath9 mm ) , and may extend only a limited distance along the pil .",
    "furthermore , we propose that _ tangled _ magnetic fields are present within these current sheets .",
    "a tangled field is defined as a magnetic structure in which the field lines are woven into an intricate fabric , and individual field lines follow nearly random paths .",
    "we suggest that the field is tangled on a spatial scale of 0.11 mm , comparable to the pressure scale height @xmath10 of the prominence plasma ( @xmath11 mm ) .",
    "the prominence plasma is assumed to be located at the many dips of the tangled field lines .",
    "the tangled field is confined horizontally by the vertical fields on either side of the sheet , and vertically by the weight of the prominence plasma .",
    "a key feature of a tangled field is that the plasma and field are in magnetostatic equilibrium , i.e. , the lorentz force is balanced by the gas pressure gradients and gravity .",
    "therefore , a tangled field is quite different from `` turbulent '' magnetic fields in which large - amplitude alfvn waves are present ( e.g. , the solar wind ) . in a tangled field",
    "the magnetic perturbations do not propagate along the field lines . in this paper",
    "we examine the basic properties of tangled fields , and we investigate their ability to support the prominence plasma .",
    "we suggest that the tangled field may be formed as a result of magnetic reconnection , not the twisting or stressing of field lines .",
    "quiescent prominences are located above polarity inversion `` lines '' that are often more like wide bands of mixed polarity separating regions with dominantly positive and negative polarity . in these mixed - polarity zones ,",
    "magnetic flux elements move about randomly and opposite polarity elements may cancel each other .",
    "new magnetic bipoles frequently emerge from below the photosphere .",
    "these processes causes the `` recycling '' of the photospheric flux about once every 2 to 20 hours , and the coronal flux is recycled even faster @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the interactions between these flux elements produce a complex , non - potential magnetic field in the low corona . within",
    "this environment magnetic reconnection is likely to occur frequently at many different sites in the corona above the inversion zone .",
    "each reconnection event may produce a bundle of twisted field , and the twisted fields from different events may collect into larger conglomerates to form a tangled field . the tangled field may rise to larger heights ( as a result of its natural buoyancy ) , and may collect into a thick sheet that is sandwiched between smoother fields , as illustrated in figure [ fig : cartoon2]b .",
    "the observed prominence consists of plasma that is trapped within this sheet .",
    "new tangled field is continually injected into the sheet from below , producing vertical motions within the sheet .",
    "we suggest that the `` dark plumes '' observed by @xcite may be a manifestation of such vertical motions of the tangled field .",
    "the spatial distribution of plasma within the prominence is determined in part by the dynamics of plasma along the tangled field lines .",
    "figure [ fig : flow_cartoon ] shows the contorted ( but generally downward ) path of an individual field line in the tangled field .",
    "note that there are several `` dips '' where the field line is horizontal and curved _ upward _ , and `` peaks '' where the field is horizontal and curved _ downward_. tracing the field line upward from a dip , one always reaches a peak where the field line again turns downward .",
    "therefore , the question arises whether the plasma collected in the dips would remain in these dips or be siphoned out of the dips via the peaks of the field lines .    to answer this question , we consider a simple model for the motion of the prominence plasma along the magnetic field . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the flow takes place in a thin tube surrounding the selected field line ( i.e. , the divergence of neighboring field lines is neglected ) , and the cross - sectional area of this tube is taken to be constant .",
    "we assume a steady flow is established along the tube .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the plasma velocity and density as functions of position @xmath14 along the tube , then conservation of mass requires @xmath15 = constant .",
    "the equation of motion of the plasma is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the plasma pressure , @xmath18 is the height above the photosphere , and @xmath19 is the acceleration of gravity . the equation of state is written in the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants ( we use @xmath23 to describe non - adiabatic processes ) . eliminating @xmath17 and @xmath13 from equation ( [ eq : flow1 ] ) , we obtain the following equation for the parallel flow velocity : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sound speed ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the above equation has a critical point where the flow velocity equals the sound speed ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , a transition from subsonic to supersonic flow can occur only at points where the rhs of this equation vanishes , @xmath28 .",
    "these sonic points are located at the peaks of the field lines where matter can be siphoned out of one dip and deposited into another dip at lower height .",
    "the resulting flow pattern is indicated in figure [ fig : flow_cartoon ] .",
    "as the supersonic flow approaches the next dip , it must slow down to subsonic speeds , which can only happen in a shock .",
    "therefore , the tube has a series of subsonic and supersonic flows separated by shocks and sonic points .",
    "the role of these shocks is to dissipate the gravitational energy that is released by the falling matter .",
    "the position and strength of the shocks can be computed if the height @xmath18 of the flow tube is known .",
    "neighboring peaks are generally not at the same height .",
    "therefore , each section between neighboring peaks is approximated as a large - amplitude sinusoidal perturbation superposed on a generally downward path : @xmath29 where @xmath14 is the position along the flow tube , @xmath30 is the distance between neighboring peaks ( as measured along the flow tube ) , @xmath31 is the amplitude of the perturbation in height , @xmath32 is a phase angle , and @xmath33 is the background slope .",
    "the phase angle is chosen such that the peaks in the flow tube ( where @xmath28 ) are located at @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then the slope is given by @xmath36 the sonic points will then be located at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    figure [ fig : flow_shock]a shows the height @xmath18 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 rad , so that @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 be the pressure , density and sound speed at the sonic points , then @xmath43 , and the sound speed can be written as @xmath44^{(\\gamma-1)/2 } = c_0 [ v(s)/c_0 ] ^{-(\\gamma-1)/2 } .\\ ] ] inserting this expression into equation ( [ eq : flow2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the pressure scale height at the sonic points .",
    "equation ( [ eq : flow3 ] ) can be integrated as follows : @xmath48 + \\frac{1}{\\gamma-1 } \\left [ u^{1-\\gamma}(s ) - 1 \\right ] = - \\frac{z(s)-z(s_0 ) } { \\gamma h_{p,0 } } , \\label{eq : flow4}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the position of a sonic point .",
    "equation ( [ eq : flow4 ] ) can be solved for @xmath50 by newton - raphson iteration .",
    "when @xmath51 , there is an analytic solution for @xmath50 in terms of the lambert @xmath52 function ( see * ? ?",
    "* ) ; in the present paper we assume @xmath53 .",
    "the supersonic solution @xmath54 is computed with @xmath55 , and the subsonic solution @xmath56 is computed with @xmath57 .",
    "the dashed curves in figure [ fig : flow_shock]b show @xmath54 and @xmath56 , and figure [ fig : flow_shock]c shows the corresponding sound speeds @xmath58 and @xmath59 . here",
    "we assumed a scale height @xmath60 , equal to the amplitude of the field - line distortions .",

    "the plasma density @xmath13 along the flow tube is determined by mass conservation ( @xmath15 = constant ) , and is plotted in figure [ fig : flow_shock]d . note that there is a strong peak in the density at the dip in the field line , @xmath66 .",
    "the dashed curve in figure [ fig : flow_shock]d shows the density profile that would exist if the plasma were in hydrostatic equilibrium ( he ) : @xmath67 , \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath10 are the density and pressure scale height at the dip , @xmath69 .",
    "the deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are significant only in those regions where the flow velocity is comparable to the sound speed .",
    "we define an average flow velocity @xmath70 by @xmath71 for the case shown in figure [ fig : flow_shock ] we find @xmath72 , so the average flow speed is less than the sound speed .",
    "therefore , the contorted shape of the flow tube significantly reduces the flow velocity compared to the supersonic free fall that would occur in a straight vertical tube .",
    "the cooler parts of the prominence are thought to have a temperature @xmath73 k. assuming a hydrogen ionization fraction of 10% , a helium abundance of 10 % and @xmath53 , the sound speed @xmath74 km  s@xmath3 , and we predict an average flow velocity @xmath75 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the vertical component of this velocity is @xmath76 km  s@xmath3 , less than the observed vertical velocities in prominence threads ( 510 km  s@xmath3 ) .",
    "note that the predicted velocity is relative to the _ pattern _ of the tangled field , therefore , if the tangled field expands in the vertical direction it will push the prominence plasma upward .",
    "we speculate that the observed upward motions in hedgerow prominences ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are due to such large - scale changes in the tangled field .",
    "in this section simple models for tangled fields are developed .",
    "a volume @xmath77 in the corona is considered , and the plasma inside this volume is assumed to be in magnetostatic equilibrium , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the plasma pressure , @xmath80 is the density , @xmath81 is the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath82 is the lorentz force .",
    "all quantities are functions of position @xmath83 within the volume .",
    "the lorentz force is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the electric current density and @xmath86 is the magnetic field . using tensor notation , equation ( [ eq : f ] )",
    "can also be written as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the magnetic stress tensor , a special case of maxwell s stress tensor @xcite : @xmath89 the first term describes magnetic pressure , and the second term describes magnetic tension . in a tangled field both pressure and tension forces are important .",
    "if gravity and plasma pressure gradients are neglected , then @xmath90 , so the magnetic field @xmath91 must satisfy the force - free condition : @xmath92 where @xmath93 may in general be a function of position . in the special case that @xmath2 is constant throughout the volume , equation ( [ eq : fff ] ) becomes a linear equation for @xmath94 , and the solutions are called linear force free fields ( lfff ) .",
    "@xcite has shown that in a closed magnetic system with a prescribed magnetic helicity ( @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the vector potential ) the lowest - energy state is a lfff .",
    "therefore , in this paper only lfffs are considered , and @xmath2 is treated as a free parameter .",
    "we find that lfffs can be tangled .",
    "the typical length scale of the tangled field is given by the inverse of the @xmath2 parameter , @xmath97 . in the following",
    "we first consider the case that @xmath98 is small compared to the domain size @xmath99 in _ any _ direction , and then consider the boundary effects .",
    "section [ sect : cylinder ] describes tangled fields in a cylindrical domain .      in the absense of boundary conditions , the solution of equation ( [ eq : fff ] )",
    "can be written as a superposition of planar modes : @xmath100 , \\label{eq : sum}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the number of modes , @xmath102 is the wave vector ( @xmath103 ) , @xmath104 is the mode amplitude , @xmath105 is a phase angle , and @xmath106 $ ] are unit vectors that are mutually orthogonal and form a right - handed basis system : @xmath107 here @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the direction angles of the wave vector relative to the cartesian reference frame .",
    "figure [ fig : volume ] shows an example of a field with @xmath110 modes , an isotropic distribution of direction angles @xmath111 , and randomly selected phase angles @xmath105 .",
    "the starting points of the field lines are randomly selected from the central part of the box , and the field lines are traced until they reach the box walls .",
    "note that individual field lines follow random paths , and that different field lines are tangled together .",

    "the phase angles are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the range @xmath114 $ ] , and angles from different modes @xmath115 and @xmath116 are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "then the ensemble average of the magnetic field vanishes , @xmath117 where @xmath118 denote the average over phase angles @xmath105 . also , the average of the tensor @xmath119 is given by @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the unit tensor ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "expression ( [ eq : tens1 ] ) is independent of position @xmath83 , so the magnetic field is statistically _ homogeneous _ , but is not necessarily isotropic .",

    "the ensemble average of the magnetic stress tensor , equation ( [ eq : t ] ) , is given by @xmath153 which is also isotropic .",
    "note that the diagonal components of @xmath154 are negative , so the effects of magnetic pressure dominate over the effects of magnetic tension .",

    "what are the conditions for such confinement ? to answer this question",
    "we must consider the boundary region between a tangled field and a smooth field .",
    "the tangled field is assumed to be characterized by a high value of @xmath158 , and the smooth field presumably has a much lower value of @xmath159 . to last a long time",
    ", the magnetic field near the boundary must be approximately in equilibrium ( non - linear force - free field ) . the force - free condition ( [ eq : fff ] )",
    "implies that @xmath2 is constant along field lines , so there can not be many field lines that pass from the smooth region to the tangled region .",
    "therefore , one important condition for the survival of the tangled field is that the two regions are nearly disconnected from each other magnetically .",
    "another requirement is that the two regions are approximately in pressure balance .    to show that these conditions can be satisfied",

    "the reason is that expression ( [ eq : compress ] ) is not an exact solution of the magnetostatic equilibrium equation .",

    "we now assume that the tangled field pervades not only the observed vertical threads but also their local surroundings .",

    "sect : thread ] we consider the effect of such deformation on the field - line dips , and on the spatial distribution of the prominence plasma .",
    "the above analyses only provide an rough estimate for the density of prominence plasma that can be supported by the tangled field .",
    "the actual density distribution @xmath288 is likely to be much more complex for several reasons .",
    "first , plasma will tend to collect at the dips of the field lines , so the density will vary on the spatial scale @xmath98 of the tangled field and on the scale of @xmath10 ; this effect will be considered in more detail in section [ sect : thread ] .",
    "second , the density will vary with time because there are flows along the field lines ( see section [ sect : flows ] ) and these flows are likely to be non - steady .",
    "also , the magnetic structure is not fixed and will continually evolve as dipped field lines are distorted by the weight of the prominence plasma . to predict the actual density will require numerical simulations of the interaction of tangled fields with prominence plasma , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "according to the present theory , hedgerow prominences are supported by the pressure of a tangled magnetic field , which acts like a tenuous gas and is naturally buoyant .",
    "it is well known that a tenuous medium supporting a dense medium is subject to rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the observed vertical threads may be a consequence of rt instability acting on the tangled field and the plasma contained within it . as cool plasma collects in certain regions of the tangled field , the weight of the plasma deforms the surrounding field , which causes even more plasma to flow into these regions .",
    "a detailed analysis of the formation of prominence threads by rt instability is complicated by the fact that we presently do not understand how a tangled field responds to shear deformation . in section [",
    "sect : shear ] we estimated the relative vertical displacement @xmath269 of the prominence plasma assuming no reconnection occurs during the deformation of the magnetic field by gravity forces [ see equations ( [ eq : dh1 ] ) and ( [ eq : dh2 ] ) ] . in this case",
    "the tangled field behaves as an `` elastic '' medium with magnetic forces proportional to the displacement .",
    "however , it is not clear that this approximation is valid .",
    "high - resolution observations of prominences indicate that the dense threads move downward relative to their more tenuous surroundings with velocities of the order of 10 - 30 @xmath289 .",
    "if the threads and their surroundings are indeed coupled via tangled fields , these relative motions imply that the field is continually being stretched in the vertical direction .",
    "therefore , the shear stress continually increases with time , unless there is internal reconnection that causes the shear stress to be reduced .",
    "we speculate that tangled fields have a tendency to relax to the lfff via internal reconnection .",
    "a similar relaxation processes occurs in the reversed field pinch and other laboratory plasma physics devices .",
    "therefore , the long - term evolution of prominence threads likely involves small - scale reconnection within the tangled field .",
    "the tangled field may behave more like a `` plastic '' medium that is irreversibly deformed when subjected to shear stress .",
    "such plasticity makes it possible to understand how the dense threads can move downward relative their the surroundings at a small but constant speed .",
    "these flows significantly deform the tangled field , but the field is nevertheless able to support the plasma against gravity . a detailed analysis of reconnection in tangled fields and its effect on the prominence plasma is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "the observed vertical structures likely reflect the non - linear development of the rt instability in hedgerow prominences . to establish a vertical column of mass resembling",
    "a prominence thread will likely require vertical motions over a significant height range ( tens of mm ) .",
    "starting from a homogeneous density distribution , it may take several hours for the threads to form by rt instability .",
    "we now construct a model for the density distribution in a fully formed ( vertical ) prominence thread supported by a tangled field .",
    "it is assumed that the rt instability has produced a vertical thread that is clearly separated from the rest of the prominence plasma .",
    "therefore , only a single thread and its local surroundings are considered , and the tangled field is assumed to be contained in a vertical cylinder with radius @xmath282 mm . as discussed in section [ sect : flows ] , there will in general be mass flows along the tangled field lines , but for the purpose of the present model we neglect such flows and we assume that the plasma is in hydrostatic equilibrium along the field lines .    to construct the density model , we first compute a particular realization of the lfff with @xmath290 ( see appendix for details ) . to account for the weight of the prominence plasma , this field",
    "is further deformed as described by equation ( [ eq : hr ] ) .",
    "the deformation parameters are @xmath291 mm and @xmath292 mm , which yields @xmath293 mm , somewhat larger than the values used in figure [ fig : shear]b .",
    "as shown in section [ sect : compress ] , the weight of the prominence plasma causes the strength of the tangled field to decrease with height [ see equation ( [ eq : compress ] ) ] , but for simplicity this gradient is neglected here .",

    "the density @xmath298 in this volume is computed on a grid with @xmath299 grid points , using the following method .",
    "we randomly select a large number of points within the cylinder and trace out the field lines that pass through these points . for each field line",
    "we plot the height @xmath18 as function of position @xmath14 along the field line , and we find the peaks and dips in the field line . for each dip",
    "we find the two neighboring peaks ( @xmath300 and @xmath301 ) and we determine the depth @xmath302 of the valley between these peaks .",
    "we then iteratively remove shallow dips with @xmath303 by concatenating neighboring sections .",
    "figure [ fig : dips ] shows an example for one particular field line ; the remaining dips with @xmath304 are indicated by squares .",
    "we then compute the density @xmath13 in each interval , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium along the field line [ see equation ( [ eq : rho ] ) ] .",
    "since we are interested only in _ relative _ densities , we set @xmath305 , the same for all dips on all field lines . finally , we distribute the density @xmath13 onto the 3d grid by finding the grid points that lie closest to the path of the field line . this process is repeated for 8000 field lines to obtain the density @xmath298 throughout the 3d grid .",
    "figure [ fig : mass_plot ] shows the resulting density distribution .",
    "the three panels show different projections obtained by integration in the @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 directions , respectively [ for example , figure  [ fig : mass_plot]a shows @xmath306 .",
    "note that the plasma is concentrated in the central part of the cylinder ; this is due to the deformation of the magnetic field described by the vertical displacement @xmath281 , which changes the distribution of the field - line dips compared to that in the lfff .",
    "the plasma is highly inhomogenous ( @xmath307 ) , and is distributed in sheets corresponding to surfaces of field - line dips . in some regions there",
    "are multiple sheets along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the h  i lyman lines in solar prominences , which indicate multiple threads along the los .",
    "the above model is quasi - static and does not take into account the expected mass flows along the field lines ( section [ sect : flows ] ) , nor the dynamical processes by which the threads are formed ( section [ sect : rt ] ) .",
    "constructing a more realistic 3d dynamical model of a prominence thread supported by tangled fields is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , our main conclusion that the density distribution within the thread is highly inhomogeneous is likely to be valid also in the dynamical case .",
    "we propose that hedgerow prominences are supported by magnetic fields that are `` tangled '' on a spatial scale of 1 mm or less .",
    "a key feature of the model is that the plasma is approximately in magnetostatic balance , therefore , the model is different from earlier models in which the plasma is supported by mhd - wave pressure . in the present case",
    "the perturbations of the magnetic field do not propagate along the field lines .",
    "the tangled field is located within a large - scale current sheet standing vertically above the pil ( figure [ fig : cartoon2]b ) , and is not magnetically connected to the photosphere on either side of the pil .",
    "such tangled fields may be formed by flux emergence followed by magnetic reconnection in the low corona .    in this paper",
    "we use a variety of methods to explore the interactions of prominence plasma with tangled fields . in section [",
    "sect : flows ] a simple model for the downward flow of plasma along the distorted field lines was developed .",
    "it was shown that such flows naturally develop standing shocks where the gravitational energy of the plasma is converted into heat ; this may be important for understanding the heating of prominence plasmas .",
    "the average flow velocity is less than the sound speed , indicating that the tangled field is able to support the prominence plasma against gravity .    in section [",

    "tangled fields can be described as a superposition of planar modes .",
    "we studied the statistical properties of such fields , and found random - walk behavior of the field lines when the number of modes is sufficiently large ( @xmath308 ) . to produce tangling of the field lines on a scale of 1 mm or less , as required for our model of hedgerow prominences",
    ", we need @xmath309 @xmath310 , much larger than the values typically found in measurements of photospheric vector fields .",
    "therefore , according to the present model , hedgerow prominences are embedded in magnetic fields with high magnetic helicity density .",
    "we also considered the conditions for confinement of a tangled field by the surrounding smooth fields , and showed that despite the high helicity density tangled fields can be in pressure balance with their surroundings .",
    "in section [ sect : forces ] the `` elastic '' properties of a tangled field were considered , i.e. , their linear response to gravitational forces assuming ideal mhd .",
    "we found that the weight of the prominence plasma can be supported by the nearly isotropic magnetic pressure of the tangled field .",
    "the tangled field pervades not only the observed vertical threads , but also their local surroundings .",
    "the magnetic coupling between the threads and their surroundings is quite strong : vertical displacements of only 0.52 mm are sufficient to counteract the shear stress resulting from the different gravitational forces . in effect",
    ", the weight of a dense thread is distributed over an area that is larger than the cross - sectional area of the thread . as discussed in section  [ sect : shear ] , the observed densities in prominence threads ( @xmath311 @xmath1 ) can be supported by tangled fields with field strengths in the range 315 g.    in section [ sect : rt ] we proposed that the observed vertical structures in hedgerow prominences are a consequence of rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability acting on the tangled field and the plasma contained within it",
    ". the tangled field acts like a hot , tenuous gas and is naturally buoyant ; its support of the dense prominence plasma is likely to be unstable to flows that separate the gas into dense and less - dense columns .",

    "a detailed analysis of this instability is complicated by the fact that it requires internal reconnection to occur within the tangled field , and it is unclear how rapidly such reconnection can proceed .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to predict the vertical velocities in prominence threads .",
    "clearly , more advanced numerical simulations of the interaction of tangled fields with prominence plasma are needed .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : thread ] we simulated the density distribution in a prominence thread , using a cylindrical model for the tangled field and its deformation by gravitational forces .",
    "the results indicate that the threads have an intricate fine - scale structure .",
    "multiple structures are superposed along the los , consistent with observations of the h  i lyman lines @xcite .",

    "we assume that the radial component of the field vanishes at the cylinder wall , @xmath192 , so the field lines are confined to the interior of the cylinder .",
    "it follows that the axial magnetic flux must be constant along the cylinder : @xmath313 in cylindrical coordinates the force - free condition reads : @xmath314 we again take @xmath2 to be constant ( lfff ) .",

    "<S> solar prominences are an important tool for studying the structure and evolution of the coronal magnetic field . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider so - called `` hedgerow '' prominences , which consist of thin vertical threads . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that such prominences are supported by tangled magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> a variety of different approaches are used . </S>",
    "<S> first , the dynamics of plasma within a tangled field is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the contorted shape of the flux tubes significantly reduces the flow velocity compared to the supersonic free fall that would occur in a straight vertical tube . </S>",
    "<S> second , linear force - free models of tangled fields are developed , and the elastic response of such fields to gravitational forces is considered . we demonstrate that the prominence plasma can be supported by the magnetic pressure of a tangled field that pervades not only the observed dense threads but also their local surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> tangled fields with field strengths of about 10 g are able to support prominence threads with observed hydrogen density of the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 . finally , we suggest that the observed vertical threads are the result of rayleigh - taylor instability </S>",
    "<S> . simulations of the density distribution within a prominence thread indicate that the peak density is much larger than the average density . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that tangled fields provide a viable mechanism for magnetic support of hedgerow prominences . </S>"
