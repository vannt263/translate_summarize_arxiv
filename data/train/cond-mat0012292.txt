    "in recent years , there have been numerous studies pertaining to the determination of effective amino acid interactions for coarse - grained models of proteins @xcite .",
    "the reasons are two - fold .",
    "if reliable interaction potentials were available , they could be used , in principle , to predict the native state of a known protein sequence through energy minimization techniques  a possibility underscored by the experimental observation of anfinsen @xcite that proteins fold rapidly and reversibly into a unique conformation which he postulated to be the free energy minimum .",
    "second , the knowledge of good potentials is a necessary ingredient to perform design of protein - like sequences , i.e. finding the sequence which has the assigned target structure as its native state @xcite .",
    "a simple and popular method for the extraction of the interaction potentials is the so - called quasi - chemical approximation @xcite , which infers the strength of pairwise interactions from the relative abundance of distinct pairs of amino acids in contact . in favour of this technique",
    "are its simplicity of implementation and robustness against use of different sets of proteins used to extract the data .",
    "the quasichemical approach is , however , an approximate scheme since it neglects the peptide bonding of the amino acids by treating them as a gas . in this respect",
    "it can be viewed as a first correction to a sort of mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "quasi - chemical methods have proved valuable since they can score satisfactorily as far as thermodynamic stability is concerned .",
    "in fact , they usually assign low energies to the native state of a sequence compared to the mean energy of the same sequence mounted on unrelated structures of the same length .",
    "other alternative extraction strategies @xcite pioneered by crippen @xcite use the thermodynamic stability criterion as the extraction method itself rather than as a mere validating tool .",
    "these schemes aim at finding a set of potentials so that given a protein sequence , its native state is recognized as having an energy well - below other conformations of the same length ( decoys ) . a major advantage of such schemes is the possibility @xcite of verifying directly whether the chosen parametrization of the free energy is appropriate .",
    "in fact , if the energy function introduced to describe the system is too simplistic , then it will not be possible to adjust its parameters so that the native states of all the proteins have lower energy than each of the competing decoy conformations .",
    "in fact , recent studies @xcite have pointed out that a pairwise energy function may not stabilize even a single protein such as crambin",
    ". there are at least two explanations for the failure to learn good sets of potentials : one possibility is that structures too similar to the native one have been included in the training set of decoy conformations .",
    "the other , more serious concern , is that the parametrization for the energy function is too simple to capture the physics of the problem .",
    "therefore , a given set of proteins might be unlearnable with a particular energy function ( and strictly speaking might remain unlearnable with any energy function if infinite precision is required ) .",
    "a key difficulty in implementing this powerful procedure is in the careful choice / generation of the decoy structures . in many instances ,",
    "the decoys are generated by taking compact `` chunks '' of suitable length from a bank of proteins ( threading ) @xcite .",
    "such decoys may not be physical for certain sequences because of steric constraints and are usually not very stringent , i.e. they do not compete significantly with the native state to be occupied below the folding transition temperature .",
    "this ends up with placing rather loose or unphysical constraints on the extracted potentials .",
    "both the potentials extracted with the latter approach or the quasi - chemical one , undoubtedly capture the main features of amino acid chemistry @xcite and of the folding process @xcite .",
    "however , they have a range of applicability limited within the same scheme that was used for extraction . for example",
    ", the performance of the potentials determined using the quasi - chemical method is unsatisfactory when they are applied to unbiased folding simulations . in particular",
    ", dynamical trajectories starting from a protein s native state well below the folding transition temperature always escape from the quasi - native basin ( with a 3 - 4   root mean square deviation per site @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative strategy @xcite would be to start from a trial set of potentials , carry out repeated folding processes with the aid of a computer and find the structures with the lowest energy . if any of these structures are significantly different from the native ones , then the potentials are modified so that their energy is increased above the target native state ( destabilization ) .",
    "this process can be repeated until the native state is fully stabilized .",
    "more generally , the process should be carried out simultaneously for a set of non - homologous proteins .",
    "a key difficulty of the strategy is the need to have an efficient folding algorithm , which , in principle , could lead to the folding of a given sequence from the denatured state into its native state conformation corresponding to a given set of interaction parameters . in other words ,",
    "if one has a powerful folding alogorithm , one can tune the parameters of the potential just right to ensure that the native states of a set of proteins are accurately learnt .      here",
    ", we will present a general strategy for determining the effective interactions between the coarse - grained degrees of freedom of a protein .",
    "our procedure does not entail the difficulties associated with the methods described above .",
    "the key idea is the observation that the native states of proteins must at least satisfy the anfisenian requirement of being located at the bottom of a smooth free energy minimum @xcite with a wide basin of attraction @xcite this suggests a straightforward approach :    1 .",
    "begin with an initial guess of the potential parameters .",
    "start from the native states of several proteins and carry out an unbiased monte carlo ( or molecular dynamics ) simulation ( say at zero temperature ) and determine several accessible local minima for each of the proteins .",
    "modify the potential parameters in such a way as to destabilize these conformations in favor of the known native state conformations .",
    "4 .   iterate this procedure by returning to ( 2 ) .    after several iterations",
    ", one would expect to converge to a set of potential parameters which best capture the optimal shape of the free energy landscape in the vicinity of all the native state structures .",
    "our method adopts the thermodynamic stability scheme described before but with the proviso that the decoys would be generated by an explicit and simple dynamical process .",
    "the structures so generated are guaranteed to be stringent competitors of the native structure in housing the sequence below the folding transition temperature .",
    "our strategy is a basic pre - requisite for viable effective potentials @xcite and hence is an obligatory step along the difficult route to fully - automated folding prediction .",
    "since the scheme is both flexible and optimal , it can be used to compare the performance of many different scoring functions or parametrizations and hence select the most promising one for ab initio folding simulations .",
    "a fundamental question pertaining to our new strategy is `` how well can the native state be stabilized for a given form of the energy function ? '' . in this article",
    ", we will tackle this question and determine the optimal choice of the parameters for a given energy function in order to approach the native states as well as possible .",
    "we proceed by considering a set of 20 single chain proteins ( training set ) taken from different protein families and introduce a pairwise energy function to describe the interactions between the amino acids .",
    "then , by using an iterative procedure , we systematically modify the parameters characterizing the pairwise potentials to optimize the local stability of the native states .",
    "it is shown that the iterative procedure brings a systematic improvement of the quality of the potentials .",
    "the optimal potentials confer significant thermal stability .",
    "moreover we check the quality of our potentials by testing them on sets of hundred of decoys believed to be very stringent , obtained by levitt for seven heavily investigated proteins @xcite .",
    "the results of the tests are found to be very encouraging .",
    "the main message of our paper is to present and demonstrate the viability of the idea that the effective potential between amino acids can be learned by ensuring the local stability of the native states of many proteins simultaneously .",
    "there are obviously many ways of implementing this idea and we will present a few schemes here that we have tried and which yield remarkably good results .",
    "microscopic molecular dynamics techniques using presently available computational resources can follow the dynamics of short peptides for time scales significantly shorter than typical folding times . for these reasons ,",
    "it has become customary to simplify both the representation of protein conformations and their dynamical behaviour @xcite .",
    "most of the procedures adopted to coarse grain the microscopic degrees of freedom of proteins substitute a whole amino acid with an effective centroid placed at a suitable point along the ca - cb direction , or coinciding with one of these two atoms .",
    "this choice , that we shall also adopt in this study brings about a drastic simplification of the structure of the energy function involving only interactions between the centroids .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure that we adopted is inspired by the xfcc model of covell and jernigan @xcite . according to this model",
    ", both the dihedral angles and peptide - bond length are discretized so that there are several degrees of freedom per amino acid ( identified with ca atoms ) .",
    "this framework allows a faithful representation of protein backbones , since the coarse grained ca positions are typically within 1 @xmath0 of the crystallographic positions .",
    "the preservation of the typical angles is carried out at the expense of variations in the peptide bond length , @xmath1 , ( the separation between consecutive cas ) which can be stretched within the bounds @xmath2 .",
    "within such a range of @xmath1 , there are up to 40 possibilities for placing a ca centroid .",
    "this makes the covell - jernigan model probably the best compromise between having a description as close as possible to the continuum while retaining only few degrees of freedom @xcite . besides the ca s",
    ", we also introduce cb atoms constructed using a geometric rule ( inspired from one obtained in the continuum @xcite ) deduced from peptide geometry in the xfcc context :    @xmath3    where :    @xmath4    in the previous equations , @xmath5 is the unit vector :    @xmath6    while @xmath7 is the distance of the cb atom from the ca atom that we choose equal to 3  , @xmath8 is an appropriate angle optimally chosen to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the position of the @xmath11th ca(cb ) atom along the chain .",
    "when crystallographic positions are used , such restrictions place the cb within 0.3   of the true position ; when discretized values for ca locations are used , the discrepancy is increased to about 1  .",
    "most of the results , that we present here , are for a simple energy function with interactions only between pairs of non - consecutive ca atoms ,    @xmath12 \\cdot \\theta(4.65 - | \\vec{r}_i^{ca } - \\vec{r}_j^{ca}|)\\ ] ]    where ,    @xmath13    and @xmath14 is the step function",
    ". we will refer to this model as the model a.    @xmath15 denotes the distance - dependent strength of interactions between the @xmath16-th and the @xmath17-th amino acids along the sequence mounted on the structure @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the interaction matrix and @xmath20 denotes the type of the @xmath16th amino acid in the sequence .",
    "@xmath21 is a repulsive term that penalizes cases where two non - consecutive pairs of ca s are closer than 4.65  , a circumstance rarely encountered in protein structures . altogether ,",
    "there are 211 parameters to be learnt ( with all of them eventaully scaled by the normalization condition ) .",
    "the dynamics in conformation space is carried out using a monte carlo technique .",
    "a newly generated conformation is accepted according to the standard metropolis rule . at each",
    "attempted mc step , we move up to 2 of consecutive protein residues to unoccupied discrete positions . the new positions are constrained to satisfy a set of suitable physical constraints that we deduced by a statistical analysis of the ca and cb positions of an ensemble of over hundred single - chain globular proteins within the xfcc model .",
    "more precisely :    * the separation @xmath1 between two consecutive @xmath22 atoms ( measured in  ) must remain in the range @xmath23 ; * two non - consecutive @xmath24 atoms must not be closer than 2   . *",
    "two non - consecutive @xmath22 and @xmath24 atoms must not be closer than 2  . *",
    "the chain length is allowed to fluctuate by up to a maximum value of 4 (in magnitude ) with respect to the original length .",
    "the monte carlo algorithm was used to relax the crystallographic structure ( xfcc - discretized ) to its lowest energy states .",
    "this is conveniently done by setting the mc temperature close to zero and carrying out typically 300,000 attempted moves .",
    "the relaxed configurations are used as decoy structures for refining the potentials by requiring that the native state has lower energy than the relaxed ones .",
    "this amounts to a requirement that the optimal potentials should , at least , ensure the best local stability for the protein .",
    "a convenient way to find the optimal potentials is the use of the perceptron algorithm @xcite for the optimization of a set of linear inequalities .    in our case ,",
    "the inequalities are of the form    @xmath25    and it is possible to find one such inequality for each decoy . expression ( [ eqn : ineq ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 denotes the number of native / decoy contacts involving amino acids of types @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath28 denotes the strength of the native / decoy repulsive term .",
    "given the native state @xmath18 and the sequence @xmath29 , the 211 entries of @xmath30 plus @xmath31 depend only on the geometrical properties of the decoy structure .    for a given set of @xmath32 inequalities to be satisfied simultaneously , it is convenient to identify the one ( denoted with @xmath7 ) that , with the trial potentials is the worst satisfied one :    @xmath33    the selection of the conformation @xmath7 can be done both when @xmath34 is negative ( not all the inequalities are satisfied ) and when it is positive ( all the inequalities are already satisfied ) .",
    "@xmath35 is called the stability of the set of inequalities for a given choice of @xmath19 .",
    "once @xmath7 has been determined , one updates the trial potentials , @xmath36 ( or @xmath21 ) by adding a quantity proportional to @xmath37 ( or @xmath38 ) , where the proportionality constant is chosen to be much smaller than 1 . with this new choice of the potentials ,",
    "each inequality is re - valuated and the updating cycle is repeated .",
    "this method can be shown to converge to the optimal solution : the stability @xmath39 reaches a constant value ( optimal stability ) @xcite , which can be of either sign .",
    "if it is negative , it means that no set of potentials can be found that consistently satisfies all inequalities in the set ( unlearnable problem ) . to speed up the convergence process towards the optimal potentials , we found it useful to introduce an additional type of inequality besides ( [ eqn : ineq ] ) , namely    @xmath40    such an inequality is useful for ensuring that the native state of the protein is stable against generally open conformations ( with energy approximately zero ) while the previously introduced inequalities required stability against competing decoys .",
    "the inequalities as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ineq2 ] ) provide stringent limitations to the parameter space , thus aiding the search for optimal parameters .",
    "intuitively , if the number of inequalities exceeds the number of parameters ( 211 in our case ) and if the energy function is too simplistic it is unlikely that a solution will be found .",
    "of course , correlations in the inequalities can make the problem unlearnable even with very few inequalities or learnable with many of them .    in any case",
    ", the stability threshold can not increase upon enlarging the set of decoys / inequalities . as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the behaviour of the stability as a function of the number of decoys obtained through relaxation with the same set of interaction potentials .",
    "it can be seen that due to correlations among the decoys , the stability does not decrease appreciably after a few dozens of them have been introduced .",
    "the results of fig . [ fig : fig1 ] are valuable because they give us an estimate of the number * @xmath41 * of representative decoys to be collected at each iteration step of the potential update .    by updating the potentials",
    ", one can generate a set of decoys that are much closer in root mean square deviation ( rmsd ) to the target one than the previous decoys .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] where the abrupt decrease of stability is visible upon addition of the new decoys .",
    "the iterative potential update can be repeated until the stability becomes negative or even beyond that . at each iteration step , it is useful to monitor the average rmsd of the decoys from the native conformations .",
    "it can be anticipated that , as the iterations proceed , the rmsd will decrease down to a minimal value and then rise again .",
    "we consider this as a natural cutoff value  any decoy with a rmsd below this value ought to be identified with the native state itself for a given choice of the energy function .",
    "of course , the better the choice of the energy functional , the lower this cutoff will be .    in our study",
    ", we have first applied this method to a single protein for didactic purposes .",
    "there after , we considered a set of 20 proteins ( trial set ) as representatives of the main folds ( see table [ tab : train ] ) and attempted to learn them simultaneously by storing 100 decoys ( 5 for each them ) before each potential update .",
    "we began by considering a single protein , pdb code : 1vcc , which has 77 residues .",
    "starting from a set of random potentials , we generated 30 decoys for which we computed the average rmsd , @xmath42 , from the native structure and its variance @xmath43 . with these decoys",
    ", we found the potentials by applying the perceptron algorithm and the normalization condition ( @xmath44 ) which sets the energy scale . with the new interaction parameters",
    ", we generated 30 more decoys and kept repeating this procedure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1vcc ] we show the rmsd , @xmath42 , as a function of the number of iterations .",
    "it is remarkable that , with such a simple model , @xmath42 can be decreased dramatically from the initial value of about 6 to around 1.5 - 2.0  , which is just over the order of the experimental uncertainty !",
    "this provides a nice demonstration of the fact that although , strictly speaking , the problem of learning the pairwise interactions is unlearnable @xcite  for otherwise one would reach zero rmsd - it is nevertheless possible to stabilize the native state in the native basin within a low uncertainty .",
    "the decrease of perceptron stability as a function of iteration is shown in figure [ fig : stab1vcc ] .",
    "it is instructive to analyze in detail the plot of fig .",
    "[ fig:1vcc ] in order to clarify some issues in the use of the perceptron learning procedure . at the first iteration",
    ", we set the short range repulsive potential parameter @xmath21 equal to zero and select random values for the 210 interaction parameters . with this choice",
    ", very compact conformations can be reached and consequently the radius of gyration of the decoys is very small and the rmsd quite high ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1vcc ] ) .",
    "however , learning the potentials from this set of decoys leads to a strictly positive value for @xmath21 . indeed",
    ", starting from the second iteration , the radius of gyration approaches that of the native state and consequently the values of rmsd start to decrease systematically .",
    "notably , just a few iterations are sufficient to set the correct relative scale between the pair potential interactions and @xmath21 .",
    "this scale , which impacts on the overall compactness , and is analogous to the average value of the pairwise interaction can not be unambiguously determined within other schemes for potential extraction such as the quasi - chemical approximation or threading .",
    "next , we attempted a task considerably more difficult , which was an attempt to stabilize the native states of twenty proteins simultaneously .",
    "the twenty proteins , shown in table [ tab : train ] were chosen among a list of non - redundant representatives of the main protein folds . at each iteration step",
    ", we generated 5 decoys for each of them .",
    "we saw an improvement as the iterations went on , although not as pronounced as for the single 1vcc protein with @xmath42 decreasing to a value of 3.8 @xmath45 0.5  .",
    "the typical behavior is illustrated by that of a single protein ( chosen to be 1vcc ) during the learning procedure of the potential for the full set of 20 proteins .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1vcc20 ] ) .",
    "the table of the extracted potential parameters is given in appendix a.    as recommended by lazaridis and karplus @xcite in their recent review article on potential extraction , as an independent test of the quality of our potentials we assessed their performance on a set of seven proteins ( see first column of table [ tab : rank ] ) unrelated to those used for extracting the potentials and for which more than 600 stringent decoys structures ( for each protein ) have been derived@xcite .",
    "this unbiased study ought to reflect the portability of our potentials , i.e. their applicability in contexts different from which they have been derived .",
    "the test we have performed is the following .",
    "for each protein we compute the energy of the the native state @xmath46 and the energy of all the decoys @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) ( where m is the number of decoys for each single protein ) by using our optimal potentials . with the correct potentials",
    ", @xmath46 should be always lower than any other @xmath47 . in table",
    "[ tab : rank ] we report the ranking in energy of the ground state with respect to all the other decoys .",
    "the native state structure is never the highest ranking one but is always among the best 5 to 10 % .",
    "to better elucidate the quality of our potentials , we have created a scatter plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evsrmsd ] ) of the energy of the decoys ( relative to the native state energy ) versus the rmsd from the native state . from ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evsrmsd ] ) , the two quantities are seen to be correlated . this is a highly non - trivial result since it is generally difficult to get such correlations even employing specially designed energy scoring functions @xcite .",
    "we now turn to a verification of how our potential compares with others in stabilizing the native state . to do this we decided to estimate a new set of potentials by applying the perceptron learning scheme to the decoys of park and levitt .",
    "in other words , we identify the set of potentials which maximally stabilize the ground state of the seven proteins chosen in ref . with respect to their own competing decoys . with the new potentials we checked the asymptotic rmsd reached on each of the 20 proteins in our training set and compared it to the stability obtained with our previous optimal potentials .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : confronto ] we repeated the same analysis but working with the seven proteins of the levitt data bank and the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : sette ] .",
    "remarkably , on the average , the optimal potentials are able to stabilize the proteins with an accuracy higher than those obtained by using the potentials extracted using the decoys of ref . .",
    "as another stringent test , we compared the performance of our potentials with those extracted with the quasi - chemical approximation . according to the basic prescription of such a scheme ,",
    "the strength , @xmath49 , of the interaction between two amino acid types @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be deduced from the number of contacting @xmath16-@xmath17 pairs , @xmath50 , and the relative abundance of the types , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in the proteins in the training set .",
    "such potentials are determined up to a multiplicative constant and an additive one .",
    "we chose the additive constant of the quasi - chemical potentials by setting their average to zero .",
    "finally we set the norm of the potential vector to 1 , as for the optimal set .",
    "these choices ensure that the two potentials sets are similar and can be compared on an equal footing .",
    "we also checked the robustness of the extracted potentials by checking that using ten additional proteins for the extraction procedure did not alter the potential values appreciably .",
    "@xmath53    likewise , the strength of the repulsive term , @xmath21 , was obtained by replacing , in equation ( [ eqn : quasi ] ) , @xmath50 with the number of non - consecutive ca pairs that are below 4.5  , while @xmath54 is replaced by the total number of ca atoms .",
    "we have extracted the quasi - chemical potentials from the twenty proteins in the training set . using this potential , and our monte - carlo procedure",
    ", we assessed how well the twenty proteins could be stabilized .",
    "the results are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : mij ] .",
    "the figure shows that quasichemical potentials do not provide the best stability and their performance is somewhat worse than that obtained on learning with the park and levitt decoys .    as a final test , in order to verify the possibility of improving our approach , we have introduced a slightly more sophisticated model , model b , where we consider interactions between all possible pairs of ca and cb at a sequence separation greater than 1 .",
    "the specific interaction is concentrated on the cb atoms , when present . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction between ca atoms is assumed to be independent of the type of amino acids .",
    "since glycine lacks a cb atom , a gly pair will only interact through the ca - ca potentials .",
    "for this reason the ca - ca interaction can be identified in our model with the gly - gly interaction , while interactions between ca - cb will be of type gly - x , where x is the amino acid type to which the cb belongs @xcite . in the model",
    ", a short range repulsive energy is now present between all pairs of residues ( ca - ca ,",
    "ca - cb and cb - cb ) and therefore the hard core repulsion described earlier is no longer needed .    using this second model , we repeated the same analysis as before and as demonstrated in figures [ fig:1vccb ] and [ fig : venti ] and in table [ tab : rank2 ] , we get an improvement of the results .",
    "this example is helpful in illustrating the possibility of using our novel optimization technique in selecting the `` most physical '' energy parameterization .",
    "we have demonstrated how one may extract effective interaction potentials between amino acids in a coarse - grained description of a protein .",
    "the method relies on the possibility of finding a set of competitive decoys of the native state .",
    "we outlined an iterative procedure to generate these decoys which attempts to stabilize , at least locally , the native state .",
    "the results obtained with simple forms of the energy function are very promising  we were able to stabilize a set of 20 proteins to an average distance of less than 4 and moreover , the potentials , when applied to other test with completely unrelated decoys , yield encouraging results .",
    "the use of slightly more sophisticated and complete forms of the energy function together with a non - discretized representation of the protein should lead to even further improvement .",

    "<S> the prediction of the three - dimensional structures of the native state of proteins from the sequences of their amino acids is one of the most important challenges in molecular biology . </S>",
    "<S> an essential ingredient to solve this problem within coarse - grained models is the task of deducing effective interaction potentials between the amino acids . over the years several techniques have been developed to extract potentials that are able to discriminate satisfactorily between the native and non - native folds of a pre - assigned protein sequence . in general , when these potentials are used in actual dynamical folding simulations , they lead to a drift of the native structure outside the quasi - native basin . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we present and validate an approach to overcome this difficulty . by exploiting several numerical and analytical tools we set up a rigorous iterative scheme to extract potentials satisfying a pre - requisite of any viable potential : the stabilization of proteins within their native basin ( less than 3 - 4 @xmath0 crms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is flexible and is demonstrated to be applicable to a variety of parametrizations of the energy function and provides , in each case , the optimal potentials </S>",
