    "this paper is the second of two , the first of which [ ms ] provides an example ( figure 1 ) of a physical optimization problem involving minimal surfaces and threads of viscoelastic fluids with prescribed boundary and initial conditions .",
    "this has a solution which is the limit of minimizers of an energy functional , that is the limit of images of harmonic maps .",
    "the regularity associated with minimizers , such as harmonic map images , can help establish existence of limits of such minimizers .",
    "the limiting process in our example has two features of interest .",
    "it involves dimension collapsing of the images of the harmonic maps , where the lower dimensional sets are part of the solution , and discontinuities can arise in bubbling .",
    "although in our example each limit of images can be achieved as a point - wise limit by careful construction of a sequence of harmonic maps once it has been found [ ms ] , a general sequence will not have a defined point - wise limit .",
    "this , the second paper provides two versions of a topology that overcomes both the problem of requiring the lower dimensional sets to be kept in the limit , and the problem of discontinuities due to bubbling in a sequence of harmonic map images .",
    "this is done using sphere bundle measures ( on @xmath5@xmath3 ) to represent sets in @xmath1 and to take limits of sphere bundle measures rather than the underlying sets , then to project down in the limit .",
    "the sphere bundle measure compactness has the added advantage of providing a topology which compactifies certain unions of @xmath0 @xmath6-rectifiable subsets of @xmath1 with @xmath6 varying from 0 to @xmath7 , where the boundaries and singular sets are also @xmath0 rectifiable .",
    "fortunately our motivating example consists of taking limits of sets which are @xmath0 @xmath4-rectifiable , as they are images of harmonic maps .",
    "more generally we would hope for the required regularity whenever we take sequences of minimizers of functionals .",
    "figure 1 shows a sequence of images of harmonic maps from varying annuli into @xmath8 with fixed boundary circles [ ms ] .",
    "a topological cylinder can be seen shrinking down to two discs union a straight segment .",
    "such a sequence could represent a physical optimization problem of a liquid film with elasticity and surface tension forming a minimum energy configuration .",
    "the surface tension causes area to be locally minimized resulting in the two discs , while the elasticity causes the residual thread connecting the two discs to remain .",
    "* figure 1 : dimension collapsing *    conventional geometric measure theory provides measures and topologies with compactness and regularity theorems that represent the above sequence in terms of area measure .",
    "this will represent the cylinders and discs , but will miss the residual straight line segment .",
    "our goal is to find a measure and a topology which will represent both the area measure and the straight line segment in the limit .",
    "this would enable geometric measure theory compactness and regularity theorems to be applied to these more general problems involving sequences of sets whose dimensions collapse in the limit .",
    "we take a measure based on the normal or outward pointing vectors to obtain the desired concentration of measure around the straight line segments as curvature increases and becomes infinite . in the limit we obtain a circle of outward vectors concentrated at each point in the straight line segment , thus giving 2-dimensional measure along the length the segment .",
    "we will see in section 2 that outward vectors also allow boundary to be weighted , giving another way for a measure to capture dimension collapsing , for example when an interval shrinks in length down to a point .",
    "the two masses at each end of the interval coincide in the limit , leaving mass at the point .",
    "this new topology requires , among other uniform bounds conditions , the set of outward vectors to be rectifiable . in our example",
    "application the sequence has this regularity by virtue of being images of harmonic maps .",
    "so in general , in applications we would take sequences of sets which are themselves minimizers of some functional which endows them with the necessary regularity to have rectifiable outwards vectors . typically being @xmath0 almost everywhere , with @xmath0 boundary or singular sets will be sufficient to ensure outward vector regularity .",
    "see section 3 for necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "our approach and applications follow on from two approaches within the mathematics of minimal surfaces . the use of harmonic maps to find minimal surfaces [ d ] and the development of measure based compactness theorems , such as for varifolds [ al ] and for currents [ ff ] , in geometric measure theory . for introductions to the is field",
    "see [ mf ] for many examples , and [ ly],[s ] and [ hs ] , give deeper treatments , with [ f1 ] as the general case reference not written for the uninitiated .",
    "[ ma ] covers sets from a measure theoretic viewpoint .",
    "the set of outward pointing vectors on a smooth subset of @xmath1 of any dimension will be an n-1 manifold on the @xmath3 bundle of @xmath1 .",
    "thus can be treated as an @xmath9-rectifiable current or varifold in the @xmath10 bundle , @xmath1@xmath3 .",
    "this enables current or varifold compactness to be used on the @xmath3 bundle so that a limit is obtained which can be projected down to @xmath1 .",
    "the underlying objects of geometric measure theory are rectifiable sets .",
    "these have the following definitions :    rectifiable sets    an m - dimensional set in @xmath1 is countably n - rectifiable if    @xmath11and _ _",
    "_ _ @xmath12 , are lipschitz functions for j=1,2,3 .... [ s. p 58 ]    this leads to the equivalent definition [ s. p 59 ]    an n - dimensional set is countably n - rectifiable iff    @xmath13where @xmath14 and each @xmath15 @xmath16 is an m - dimensional embedded @xmath17 submanifold of @xmath1 .",
    "any rectifiable current or rectifiable varifold has underlying rectifiable set on which the current or varifold has density @xmath18 0 .",
    "varifolds should be considered as rectifiable sets which have a measurable point - wise density [ mf p11][f1 , 2.9.12 , 2.10.19 ] , and unique approximate tangent cones almost everywhere .",
    "see [ mf p28 ] for approximate tangent cones and [ mf p92 ] for points without unique tangent cones .",
    "currents , duals to forms , should be considered as sets with density and unique approximate tangent cones and orientation .",
    "we also use the notion of @xmath0 @xmath19-rectifiable sets which were introduced by anzellotti [ an ] .",
    "@xmath0 @xmath19-rectifiable are sets for which the @xmath20 in definition 1.2 are embedded in @xmath0 submanifolds    these @xmath0 submanifolds will have @xmath17 lifts , enabling the lifts of the @xmath20 to be rectifiable .",
    "more specifically , our unions of rectifiable sets can be regarded as multivarifolds as introduced by dao and fomenko[df][fo ] .",
    "they in fact used these multivarifolds to express limits of manifolds with dimension collapsing just as in our example .",
    "[ fu][f2 ] show these can be the projections into @xmath1 of currents which can be seen as representing curvature measure of the underlying sets .",
    "this is precisely the measure that concentrates around parts of manifolds that collapse in dimension .",
    "we can now state the main results of this paper :      this theorem gives the main gaol of the paper to provide a measure based topology that captures dimension collapsing .",
    "let m@xmath21 be a sequence of unions of @xmath0 j - rectifiable sets of positive h@xmath22 measure in @xmath1 , ( with j taking on different values ; @xmath23 ) where each of the outward vector lifts , @xmath24 , will all be n-1 rectifiable sets in @xmath1@xmath3 .",
    "if the corresponding sequence @xmath25 of outward vector lifts converge as n-1 rectifiable currents or n-1 rectifiable varifolds in @xmath1@xmath3 , then the image m of the projection of the limit current or varifold , will itself be a union of j - rectifiable sets in @xmath1 , ( @xmath23 ) . also all dimension collapsing will be captured .",
    "if the first variation of the lifts is uniformly bounded then the lifts may converge as varifolds , if the homological boundary is uniformly bounded then the lifts may converge as currents .",
    "see sections 3 and 5 for conditions on when convergence as varifolds or currents will occur .      in section 2",
    ", we examine the process of taking the outward vectors for smooth submanifolds with boundary of all dimensions in @xmath1 .",
    "these give rise to a n-1 dimensional set in @xmath1@xmath3 , the trivial sphere bundle over @xmath1 .",
    "we see why we need to represent more than just the vectors normal to tangent planes by including extra vectors on boundary points .",
    "this ensures the measure captures dimension collapsing    then in section 3 we examine these n-1 dimensional sets in @xmath5@xmath3 as rectifiable n-1 varifolds , which gives them a topology and compactness theorem . for compactness",
    "they need to meet strict conditions , finite first variation , that would not be met for example by successive polyhedral approximations to any smooth submanifold .",
    "we also explore more fully the conditions on m such that the lift constructed in section 2 will be rectifiable    section 4 shows how sets in @xmath1 can be obtained by projecting n-1 rectifiable varifolds from @xmath1@xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "this process is not the inverse of the process in section 2 as extra lower dimensional sets representing boundary or produced as a side effect .",
    "specifically , n-1 rectifiable varifolds project down to a union of rectifiable varifolds of dimensions that can vary from 0 to n-1 .",
    "section 5 shows why polyhedral approximations in @xmath1 represented as n-1 rectifiable varifolds in @xmath1@xmath3 will not satisfy the conditions for varifold compactness , but as n-1 rectifiable currents they can satisfy conditions for rectifiable current compactness .",
    "this is because the sets representing normal vectors to polyhedra can not be of finite first variation if polyhedral edge length is infinite .",
    "however current compactness has no first variation condition , so with appropriate ` filling in ' a polyhedron with infinite edge length but finite total distributional curvature ( edge length integral of dihedral angle ) can be represented as an n-1 rectifiable current .",
    "however there is one drawback of current limits that varifolds do not have .",
    "mass can disappear in the limit due to cancellation of measures with opposite orientations , or due to homothetic contraction of manifolds such as tori which have degree zero gauss maps .",
    "a method is given to overcome this using the coarea formula to further fill in the lifts until each lift is a union of @xmath3s .",
    "we give a general construction ( see figures 2 to 5 ) for lifts of a union of submanifolds of mixed dimensions from 0 to @xmath7 .",
    "these lifts will then be represented as measures in @xmath1@xmath3 where geometric measure theory compactness theorems will give limits .",
    "we will not address codimension zero subsets as these can be represented by taking @xmath1 as an isometrically embedded subset of @xmath26 and applying the construction within @xmath26 instead .",
    "an outward vector to a j - dimensional rectifiable set @xmath27 in @xmath1 at a point @xmath28 is the set of unit vectors in the tangent space of @xmath1 which has a zero or negative inner product with any vector in the approximate tangent cone of @xmath27 at @xmath28 .    in general ( @xmath29 a.e .",

    "the * special case * lift of a set @xmath27 * with a unique approximate tangent cone everywhere * is given by @xmath34@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the closure of @xmath27 .",
    "we can think of this as endowing open sets as with the boundary of their closure .",
    "this definition only makes sense where @xmath36 has a unique approximate tangent cone [ mf p28 ] [ s ] [ f1 ] .",
    "call @xmath37 the set of all points in @xmath36 with unique tangent cones",
    ". the approximate tangent cone of @xmath36 at @xmath28 can be thought of as a generalization of a linear approximation to @xmath36 at @xmath28 .",
    "it allows for singularities such as boundary or sections of planes coming together . for an m - submanifold",
    "the cone will be the cone of a link which will be an m-1 manifold in the unit sphere in the ambient space .",
    "it is known that n - rectifiable sets have tangent spaces almost everywhere .",
    "therefore @xmath38 is a set of zero measure , with respect to the dimension of @xmath36 .",

    "remark : in sets which are smooth embeddings of polygonal or simplicial complexes , i.e. : the usual singular complexes , we do have a unique approximate tangent cone everywhere .",
    "remark : note that as the lifts are to be represented as varifolds , the closure @xmath45 is equivalent as a varifold to @xmath45 .    for technical reasons , to use current compactness",

    "@xmath78    where @xmath79 is a principle curvature in a direction @xmath19 making up a local basis of @xmath80 the tangent space of @xmath27 in @xmath1 .",

    "for each @xmath19 the lift has an identity component in an @xmath83 direction , and a component in the @xmath3 direction .",

    "now there is an additional term for interior non - smooth points .",

    "( 3.3.iii ) sets have bounds on the integrals of the derivatives of curvature . _    the lifts must have uniformly finite first variation .",
    "this requires bounds on the integrals of the derivatives of curvature on the @xmath88 and finite boundary mass .",
    "also there must be finite mass on singular sets such as polyhedral dihedral angle .",
    "this is because , as illustrated in figures 3 and 4 the lifts of non - smooth points will be non - smooth",
    ". furthermore the lift of a small dihedral angle in the case of @xmath92 , will involve dihedral angles in the lift equal to @xmath93 .",
    "in other words lifting makes first variation worse , by an unbounded factor .",

    "the limiting process in the previous section gives rise to limit with an @xmath4-dimensional hausdorff measure in @xmath1@xmath3 .",

    "the rank of the map at a point depends upon how many basis vectors of the tangent space as subset of @xmath5@xmath3 lie in the @xmath1 directions and how many lie in the @xmath3 .",
    "in fact the rank is just the number of basis vectors that lie in the @xmath1 directions .",
    "accordingly say we have a limit varifold , we can decompose it into components each of which is @xmath7 rectifiable and has a fixed rank under projection to @xmath1 .",

    "it is clear that each subset of fixed rank under the projection map is itself @xmath4-rectifiable as it is contained in the original union of submanifolds .",
    "now each of these sets has a projection so we need to show that each projection is rectifiable of the correct dimension .",
    "we will prove this by contradiction .",
    "each of the @xmath95s above projects down to an @xmath97-rectifiable set @xmath98    first we show @xmath99 is rectifiable as it is a projection of a rectifiable set . as",
    "the projection of a @xmath17 submanifold is a @xmath17 submanifold then the projection is a rectifiable set using definition 1.2 .    the coarea formula [ f1 : 3.2.32 , 3.2.31 ] relates the measures of the varifolds and their projections up to sets of measure zero in the lift and in the projection .",
    "therefore we can now proceed to write down varifolds in @xmath1 in terms of the limit of lifts .",
    "* figure 6 : decomposition of part of a limit varifold and projections *    figure 6 shows how a part of a limit of lift varifolds @xmath100 of density 1 can be represented as a varifold :    @xmath101 in the case @xmath102 .",
    "also the projections are shown in @xmath8 of the underlying sets of the lift varifolds , which become the underlying sets for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "as the point underlying @xmath103 and part of the line segment underlying @xmath104 are contained in the planar region underlying @xmath105 , we can see that the limit of lifts in @xmath1@xmath10 contains more information than just the set .",
    "we can define the @xmath106s in alternate ways .",
    "first consider the following simple equation that defines varifolds @xmath106 in terms of varifold @xmath107 .",

    ".    we shall now give a construction for the @xmath109s only terms of @xmath100 .",
    "using @xmath110 to represent the density of @xmath111 which will be integer multiplicity almost everywhere , we can use modified versions of 4.1 to obtain : @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114    we can show why each double integral picks out just the measure that is desired . in finding @xmath115 ,",
    "the inner integral takes @xmath116 measure .",
    "this will eliminate any contribution to a @xmath117 for @xmath118 , as the fibers above each point will have zero @xmath116 measure .",
    "similarly the outer integral will eliminate contributions to a @xmath117 for @xmath119 .",
    "this is because although on points in @xmath120 a fiber will have infinite @xmath116 measure , this will only occur on a set zero @xmath29 measure on @xmath83    notice that for varifolds of dimension less than @xmath7 their underlying rectifiable set can be infinite .",
    "this is because there is no lower bound on the volumes of mass in each fiber .",
    "this is caused for example with a polyhedral approximation .",
    "the lengths of edges can go to infinity .",
    "so these are , in a sense , false projections as they correspond not to dimension collapsing such as threads in figure 1 but curvatures .",
    "now [ f1 3.2.31 ] allows for a cut off to be made so that only a subset of the projection is taken , that is those points that have more than a critical lower bound of mass .",
    "this new projection is then still rectifiable , and will then have finite mass .",
    "call these varifolds , @xmath121.that represent varifolds whose lift fibers all have at least mass @xmath122 .",
    "we have now proven part of theorem 1 .",
    "the case where the first variation of the lifts of a sequence of sets is uniformly bounded . in the next section we will see that this is a limiting and avoidable restriction on sets , as long as certain types of non - manifold point singularities are bounded .    remarks :    according to the area and coarea formulae there will be a discrepancy between 4.1 on the one hand and 4.2 to 4.4 on the other .",
    "the map @xmath123 always has a jacobian greater than one ( by virtue that @xmath28 is a projection ) and less than infinity ( because the measure of @xmath100 is finite ) . as we are not using density information on the @xmath115s ,",
    "this discrepancy is not important .",
    "the final stage is to take the support of each @xmath115 to obtain the limit rectifiable set as desired .",
    "we may not get integer multiplicity of the varifolds @xmath115 , so the underlying rectifiable set is a better canonical limit object , rather than the measure .",
    "one set can represent everything , but as measures , @xmath7 separate measures are needed to represent all of the set in @xmath1 , although in the sphere bundle one measure can represent the union .",
    "in particular varifolds representing boundary will have density of @xmath124 in general when no dimension collapsing occurs .",
    "in general the geometric relationship between the sets in @xmath1 and their lifts to outward pointing vectors in @xmath83@xmath3 may break down in the limit . under the right conditions in the sequence of sets in @xmath1 , such as smoothly embedded connected submanifolds without boundary and with uniformly bounded curvature everywhere , we might expect the limit of the lifts in @xmath83@xmath3 to represent the outward pointing vectors of its projection into @xmath1 .",

    "this will correspond to the order of @xmath221 vertical y - singularities on the interior of the honeycomb , where three faces come together .",
    "the homological boundary mass , from the y s is of the order of @xmath223 .",
    "the first variation , from the outer ends of the honeycomb is of order @xmath224 .",
    "we can set up a sequence where @xmath225 of honeycombs .",
    "the first variation is uniformly bounded and the homological boundary is not .    notice that if @xmath226 we can take the unions of all the honeycombs and obtain a rectifiable set which can be represented as an integer multiplicity rectifiable varifold , but not as an integer multiplicity rectifiable current .",
    "this particular example can be represented as a current mod 3 , but one can easily add extra faces to the honeycomb to create an infinite measure of singularities with 3 and infinite measure with 5 faces coming together .",
    "thus in general currents mod n do not eliminate the need for varifold compactness .",
