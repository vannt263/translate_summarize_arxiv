    "the phenomenon of anderson localization @xcite appears in a variety of quantum physical systems including electron transport in disordered solids and waves in random media ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is usually analyzed in the frame of hermitian or unitary matrices .",
    "recently , the localization properties of nonunitary complex matrices has been analyzed for euclidean matrices @xcite in relation to light and wave localization @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the possibilities of anderson like localization and delocalization for the matrices belonging to the class of markov chains and google matrix @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such matrices have real nonnegative elements with the sum of elements in each column being equal to unity . for a directed network",
    "one first defines an adjacency matrix @xmath1 which has element @xmath2 if a node @xmath3 have a link pointing to node @xmath4 and zero otherwise .",
    "the columns with only zero elements ( _ dangling nodes _ ) are replaced by columns with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the matrix size .",
    "the elements of other columns are renormalized in such a way that their sum becomes equal to unity ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "thus we obtain the matrix @xmath9 of markov transitions .",
    "then the google matrix @xmath0 of the network takes the form @xcite : @xmath10 here , the damping factor @xmath11 is taken in the range @xmath12 . in the context of the world wide web ( www )",
    "the term @xmath13 describes for a random surfer a probability to jump on any node of the network .",
    "the above construction of @xmath0 has been proposed by brin and page @xcite to describe the structure of the world wide web ( www ) . for the www",
    "it is assumed that the google search engine uses @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we can also consider a generalized case of weighted markov transitions @xmath9 corresponding to real positive elements of @xmath1 like happens for the world trade network ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 belongs to the class of perron - frobenius operators , its largest eigenvalue is @xmath15 and other eigenvalues have @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the right eigenvector at @xmath15 , which is called the pagerank ( @xmath17 ) , has real nonnegative elements @xmath18 and gives a probability @xmath18 to find a random surfer at site @xmath4 .",
    "it is possible to rank all nodes in a decreasing order of pagerank probability @xmath19 so that the pagerank index @xmath20 counts all @xmath6 nodes @xmath4 according their ranking , placing the most popular nodes at the top values @xmath21 . usually for many real directed networks the distributions of number of ingoing and outgoing links",
    "are described by a power law ( see e.g. @xcite ) , generating an average approximately algebraic decay of pagerank probability @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "some examples of directed networks can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that matrices of google class practically have not been studied in physical systems even if they naturally appear in the frame of ulam networks generated by the ulam method for dynamical maps in a coarse - grained phase space ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see if the phenomena of anderson localization and anderson delocalization transition can appear for google matrices .",
    "certain indications on a possible anderson transition for the ulam networks , built from dissipative maps , have been reported in @xcite with more detailed discussions presented in @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be useful to find random matrix models which are able to reproduce typical properties of spectrum and pagerank decay in real directed networks .",
    "however , the results presented in @xcite show that the full matrix @xmath0 with random matrix elements have an unrealistic spectrum and hence other random matrix models of @xmath0 should be developed .",
    "the models discussed in @xcite give certain indications of delocalization of eigenstates of @xmath0 but the spectrum of @xmath0 in these models has a large gap and is very far from the spectra of real directed networks . with this aim",
    "we describe below a number of random google matrix models and analyze the properties of their spectra and eigenstates .",
    "we use certain spectral properties of small size _ orthostochastic _ matrices with @xmath24 established in @xcite .",
    "we start from a description of various random matrix models of google matrix @xmath0 presenting the results of their spectral properties in next section .      following @xcite we consider _ orthostochastic _ matrix blocks @xmath25 of size @xmath26 .",
    "orthostochastic _ property means that @xmath27 , where an orthogonal matrix @xmath28 has random matrix elements obtained via random rotations .",
    "since @xmath28 is an orthogonal matrix the matrix @xmath29 is bistochastic with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the main reason to use such blocks @xmath29 is a similarity of complex spectrum of random matrix ensemble of @xmath29 with the spectrum of @xmath0 of university networks of cambridge and oxford , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the size @xmath31 can be considered as preferential random links between a group of @xmath32 friends . however , a weak point of the random ensemble of @xmath29 @xcite is a small matrix size @xmath33 , while for the above universities we have @xmath34 .",
    "google matrix eigenvalues @xmath35 ( a , b ) , and ipr @xmath36 of eigenvectors as a function of @xmath37 ( c , d ) .",

    "we use notations @xmath52 and @xmath53 for the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath0 of this model .      the model * rmz3s * is obtained from rmz3 by adding shortcut links between blocks @xmath29 in the upper triangle of the whole matrix @xmath49 , the blocks of shortcut links are placed randomly in this part of @xmath49 .",
    "the amplitude of transitions from one block to another block ( outside of three - diagonal blocks of rmz3 ) is taken at some fixed value @xmath54 .",
    "the shortcut blocks are randomly and uniformly distributed over the upper triangle of the whole matrix .",
    "_ after _ adding the shortcut blocks the columns affected by shortcut blocks are renormalized to unity .",
    "in this way the obtained matrix @xmath49 again belongs to the google matrix class .",
    "the blocks of shortcuts are placed randomly in the upper triangle of matrix @xmath49 , their number @xmath55 is determined by the parameter @xmath56 .",
    "in fact @xmath57 gives the ratio of shortcut blocks to the number of blocks @xmath58 in the model rmz3 .",

    "[ fig1]b , d ) we can use the same anzats for the left vector @xmath157 that leads to the eigenvalue equation : @xmath162 such a problem corresponds to the case of off - diagonal disorder in the @xmath163 anderson model where the localization length , and hence ipr , is diverging at the center of the band @xcite .",
    "the spectrum @xmath35 in ( [ eq6 ] ) is real .",
    "a similar problem is known as the sinai walk @xcite where transition probabilities on a markov chain are fluctuating .",
    "this model has been studied extensively ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "the spectrum @xmath35 in ( [ eq6 ] ) , corresponding to this anzats , is the same for the right eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "the right eigenvectors are different from the left ones but have a similar structure on average .",
    "the ipr values , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d are significantly reduced , comparing to the case @xmath164 , except those with @xmath35 close to unity .",
    "when @xmath6 is increasing we find that ipr is growing only for @xmath165 while for @xmath166 ipr values remains finite .",
    "this corresponds to the known results for the anderson model with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "other eigenstates for which @xmath167 is not constant inside @xmath29 blocks correspond to the eigenstates with rather small ipr values @xmath168 .",
    "even if the spectrum and eigenstates have interesting properties in the two above cases of model rmz3 there is a weak point here : the pagerank probability @xmath169 in these cases is flat being practically independent of @xmath144 and @xmath154 .",
    "thus the situation is very different from the real directed networks with @xmath170 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this happens due to a space homogeneous structure of the matrix @xmath0 ( a part of fluctuations ) and thus there is no leading node with a large number of links .",
    "due to that we try to introduce shortcut links as described in the next sec.3.2 .      the spectrum and ipr dependence for rmz3s model with shortcuts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for two typical values of parameter @xmath57 .",
    "we see that at small values of @xmath171 ( e.g. @xmath60 ) the spectrum structure is practically the same as for rmz3 model",
    ". however , for larger values ( @xmath61 ) the size of the spectrum star is decreasing .",
    "the values of ipr are significantly reduced at finite values of @xmath57 and our data show that the maximal @xmath36 values remain less than @xmath172 even for the largest size @xmath101 for @xmath173 for all @xmath93 ( data not shown ) .",

    "even if all states are localized the decay of pagerank is more close to the case of real directed networks .",

    "[ fig3]a , b show that @xmath63 have approximately algebraic decay with pagerank index .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath68 is independent of @xmath6 at large @xmath6 values .",
    "thus the homogeneous random elements in the upper triangle of @xmath49 matrix allow to obtain @xmath68 close to unity at large @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , in the limit of rather large @xmath57 we come to the case of triangular matrix @xmath49 studied in @xcite ( and also in @xcite ) where one obtains an approximate decay @xmath81 .",

    "[ fig5]a that the maximal ipr values ( excluding pagerank vectors ) are at first reduced with an increase of @xmath57 from @xmath183 up to @xmath184 but they are increased when @xmath57 goes from @xmath184 to @xmath185 .",
