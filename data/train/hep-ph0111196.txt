    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we propose to invert this logic .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have discussed a simple and tractable model , which describes very well the leading twist pion wave function @xmath2 not only in longitudinal variable @xmath3 , but also in @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we calculate the twist 3 pion wave function @xmath0 @xcite and try to extract from both @xmath5 and @xmath0 the quark condensate and mixed condensates of dimension 5 and 7 , and the gluon condensate as well .",
    "the model , which we use is a simple nonlocal chiral pion - quark model @xcite , which in principle can be obtained from the instanton model of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , since we want to work directly in the minkowski space , we have to modify the form of the nonlocality @xcite in order to make the calculations feasible .",
    "the price is that , of course , we loose the direct contact with the original model",
    ". therefore our aim is twofold .",
    "apart from giving estimates of the condensates we want to perform tests in order to gain confidence in the model as well as to find its limitations",
    ".    in most applications of the effective quark - meson theory described above , an approximation of the constant constituent quark mass was used .",
    "this approach has an impressive success in describing baryon ( which emerge as solitons ) properties ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently an attempt to include the momentum dependence in calculating solitons in the nonlocal njl model has been reported in refs.@xcite .",
    "the instanton model of the qcd vacuum is formulated in the euclidean space - time , whereas the light cone wave functions are naturally defined in the minkowski space - time .",
    "one can in principle wick rotate the integrals and perform the calculations in the euclidean metric , as has been for example done in refs.@xcite ( for early attempts to calculate the pion wave function in the instanton model see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however in this work we shall perform all calculations directly in the minkowski space - time .",
    "the instantons induce both gluon condensate , which is proportional to the density of instantons , and quark condensate , which emerges due to the delocalization of the quark zero modes @xcite",
    ". therefore both quark and gluon condensation occurs at the same scale @xmath6 , which is associated with the average instanton size @xmath7  mev . after integrating out gluons and performing the bosonization",
    ", the model reduces to the simple nambu - jona lasinio type model where the quarks interact _ nonlocally _ with an external meson field @xmath8 @xcite : @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be expanded in terms of the pion fields : @xmath11 here @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 is a momentum dependent constituent quark mass . in principle",
    "@xmath13 has been calculated in the instanton model in euclidean space time . here ,",
    "following refs.@xcite , we wish to perform calculations directly in the minkowski space . to this end",
    "we shall choose a simple pole formula @xcite @xmath14 which for @xmath15 and for @xmath16 reproduces the @xmath17 dependence obtained from the instantons reasonably well @xcite . in order to check model sensitivity to the specific form of the cutoff function ( [ cutform ] ) we shall vary @xmath18 from @xmath19 to @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "notice that @xmath13 of eq.([cutform ] ) provides an uv cutoff for the loop integrals entering the expressions for the pion wave functions .",
    "this is true both in euclidean and in minkowski space .    using this simple prescription we study various condensates , which are related to the normalization and @xmath24 moments of leading twist axial - vector ( av ) and nonleading twist pseudo - scalar ( ps ) pion light cone wave functions ( for definitions see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ) as well as the ps wave function itself .",
    "> from the point of view of qcd the quantities we calculate depend on a nonperturbative scale @xmath6 which , however , must not be confused neither with the constituent mass @xmath18 nor with an auxiliary parameter @xmath25 , which is fixed by the normalization condition for @xmath2 . for @xmath26 the ansatz ( [ cutform ] ) should imitate @xmath13 obtained from the instantons . and",
    "for the latter , as explained above , @xmath27  mev .",
    "it is therefore natural to assume that @xmath6 is of the order of a few hundred mev irrespectively of @xmath18 and @xmath25 .",
    "the precise definition of @xmath6 is only possible within qcd and in all effective models one can use only qualitative _ order of magnitude _ arguments to estimate @xmath6 .",
    "a more practical way to determine @xmath6 will be discussed in sect.[s : kt ] where we will associate @xmath6 with transverse integration cutoff @xmath28 which , as we shall see , is of the order of @xmath29  mev .    as a first step we calculate the quark condensate , which enters the normalization of the ps pion light cone wave function .",
    "the numerical result depends upon @xmath18 and @xmath21 and varies between @xmath30 mev@xmath31 and @xmath32 mev@xmath31 .",
    "the commonly used phenomenological value of @xmath33 is lower and reads approximately @xmath34 mev@xmath31 .",
    "therefore our highest value for the quark condensate overshoots the phenomenological value by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "the reason for this rather too high values of @xmath36 is a relatively slow convergence of the @xmath37 integral for this quantity .",
    "this is even more visible in the case of the @xmath24 moments of the ps wave function .",
    "indeed , one can relate both @xmath38 and @xmath39 to the same mixed condensate of dimension @xmath23 , @xmath40 , which yields @xmath41 @xcite . in our case",
    "this ratio is two times smaller .",
    "it is , however , interesting to observe , that if we cut the @xmath37 at some @xmath42 , which we choose in such a way that @xmath43 mev@xmath31 , then the ratio of @xmath44 is stable and approximately equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the mixed condensate @xmath46 comes out between @xmath47 mev@xmath48 and @xmath49 mev@xmath48 in a fair agreement with the estimates from the qcd sum rules ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately the higher moments of the ps wave function are still too large even with a @xmath24 cutoff .",
    "one of the advantages of our method is that the analytical expression for the quark condensate is given in terms of a minkowskian integral , which in a limit of a constant @xmath13 and @xmath50 reduces to the well known euclidean form . by comparing the two expressions one can by inspection",
    "guess a continuation prescription , which allows to rewrite certain euclidean integrals as the minkowskian ones .",
    "we use this , in some respect _ ad hoc _ , prescription to calculate the gluon condensate with very encouraging result : @xmath51 mev@xmath52 to @xmath53 mev@xmath54 .",
    "finally we plot the ps pion light cone wave function for our set of model parameters .",
    "we find that @xmath55 vanishes at the end points @xmath56 and @xmath57 except for the case of @xmath58 .",
    "the latter behavior is in agreement with the results obtained in ref.@xcite within the qcd sum rules .",
    "it is interesting to observe , that vanishing of @xmath59 at the end points is correlated with the fact that @xmath60 is concave at @xmath61 and @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : cond ] we shortly summarize the results of refs.@xcite concerning the relation of the @xmath24 moments of the pion wave functions to the mixed quark - gluon condensates . in sect .",
    "[ s : piwfmk ] , following ref.@xcite , we explain how to evaluate the loop integrals with the momentum dependent quark mass @xmath13 given by eq.([cutform ] ) . in sect .",
    "[ s : gg ] we construct the continuation prescription discussed above and calculate the gluon condensate . in sect .",
    "[ s : num ] we give the numerical results and sect .",
    "[ s : sum ] contains summary and conclusions .",
    "some of the results presented here have been partially reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "we shall be dealing with the leading twist axial - vector ( av ) and twist 3 pseudo - scalar ( ps ) wave functions defined as follows @xcite : @xmath64 where we have chosen @xmath65 as a light - cone vector parallel to @xmath66 and @xmath67 parallel to @xmath68 .",
    "for any 4-vector @xmath69 we have : @xmath70 both wave functions are normalized to 1 .",
    "the normalization condition for @xmath71 yields therefore the expression for @xmath72 .",
    "evaluation of the norm of @xmath73 in the present model gives : @xmath74 for @xmath75 in the local case @xmath76 and in euclidean metric eq.([qbarqm ] ) reduces to @xmath77 the last expression in ( [ qbarqe ] ) is well defined only in euclidean metric and eq.([qbarqm ] ) may serve as a prescription how it should be continued to the minkowski space .",
    "in fact , as we shall explicitly see , @xmath78 of eq.([qbarqm ] ) does not depend on @xmath79 .",
    "our approach enables to calculate not only the distributions in @xmath3 but in fact full wave functions @xmath80 both in @xmath3 and @xmath24 : @xmath81 both for av and ps channels .",
    "integrating first over @xmath3 gives the @xmath24 distribution @xmath82    it has been shown in refs.@xcite that moments of @xmath83 are given in terms of the mixed quark - gluon condensates @xmath84 here @xmath85 is a gluon field strength and @xmath86 note that formula for @xmath38 is an approximate one since the soft pion theorems used to derive ( [ kt2 ] ) apply strictly only in the pseudo scalar channel . equations ( [ kt2 ] ) predict @xmath87 for @xmath88 we have @xcite : @xmath89 where for @xmath90 the same reservations as for @xmath38 hold . unfortunately equations ( [ kt4 ] ) are almost linearly dependent .",
    "indeed , coefficients in front of the condensates are of the order of @xmath91 , whereas the determinant of ( [ kt4 ] ) is of the order @xmath92 .",
    "therefore it is difficult to disentangle the condensates from the knowledge of @xmath93 , unless the latter are known with very high accuracy .",
    "in our previous paper @xcite we have shown how to handle the loop integral , like the one in eq.([qbarqm ] ) , with momentum dependent mass @xmath13 given by eq.([cutform ] ) . to this end",
    "one introduces the light cone integration variables @xmath94 the key point of this analysis consists in finding the integration contour in the complex @xmath95 plane .",
    "the poles of the fermion propagator are given by the zeros of the following function : @xmath96 ^{4n}+i\\epsilon=0\\ ] ] which after pulling out the factor @xmath97 ^{-4n}$ ] reduces to @xmath98 and similarly for @xmath99 . here",
    "@xmath100 eq.([denom ] ) should be understood as an equation for @xmath95 .",
    "generally an equation of the form @xmath101 with @xmath102 has @xmath103 complex solutions , which in the following will be denoted as @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "these solutions depend on the specific value of @xmath106 and have to be calculated numerically . then the poles of the quark propagators in @xmath95 can be found from the following relations : @xmath107 we have shown in ref.@xcite that all the poles corresponding to eq.([poles1 ] ) should lie below the integration contour whereas the poles corresponding to eq.([poles2 ] ) above . as a result the @xmath108 integrals yield real wave functions , which vanish for @xmath3 outside the region @xmath109 . moreover for @xmath110 , i.e. for a constant @xmath13 , this prescription reduces in a continuous way to the standard one of feynman .    with this prescription",
    "the calculations are rather straightforward and we obtain : @xmath111 @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 ) . factors @xmath114 @xmath115 obey the following properties @xmath116 which are crucial for the convergence of the @xmath117 integrals .",
    "the @xmath117 integration gives : @xmath118 \\,\\ln\\left ( 1+z_{i}u+z_{k}(1-u)\\right )   \\label{avu}\\ ] ] and @xmath119 \\ln ( 1+uz_{i}+(1-u)z_{k } ) .",
    "\\label{psu}\\ ] ] the normalization condition for @xmath120 is used to fix the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath25 for given @xmath21 with @xmath121 fixed at the physical value of 93 mev .",
    "then the normalization condition for @xmath122 can be used to calculate the quark condensate .",
    "the euclidean formula for the gluon condensate in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum reads @xcite : @xmath123 in the instanton model , assuming that the gluon condensate is known , eq.([ggcond ] ) should be understood as a gap equation for the value @xmath124 , since the shape of the @xmath17 dependence is uniquely determined as a fourier transform of a fermion zero mode in the presence of the instanton configuration .",
    "alternatively , for given @xmath18 , one can use eq.([ggcond ] ) to calculte the gluon condensate .",
    "a comparison of equations ( [ qbarqe ] ) and ( [ ggcond ] ) for a constant constituent mass @xmath18 ( assuming some euclidean cutoff ) suggests the following relation between the quark and gluon condensates : @xmath125 here @xmath126 ( constituent quark mass ) and @xmath127 .",
    "let us remind that relation ( [ qbqgg8 ] ) follows from the instanton model of the qcd vacuum in the zero mode approximation and in the chiral limit ( @xmath128 ) @xcite .",
    "it would have to be substantially modified for heavy current quark mass @xmath129 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a similar relation has been obtained for an arbitrary self - dual gluonic field ( in a _",
    "gas approximation ) with , however , @xmath130 @xmath129 ( current quark mass of a light quark ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous case such a relation is not satisfied phenomenologically and moreover it can not be true in the chiral limit . on the other hand an expansion for _ large _ current quark mass @xmath131 @xcite yields in the leading order relation ( [ qbqgg8 ] ) with @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "it has been argued in ref.@xcite that this relation holds also for @xmath126 ( constituent quark mass ) .",
    "whether this identification can be theoretically justified is not obvious , since @xmath18 being of the order of 300  mev is probably not large enough to be considered as heavy .",
    "it is , however , beyond the scope of this paper to discuss here the differences between the approaches of refs.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( see , however @xcite ) .",
    "we simply use eq.([ggcond ] ) as derived in ref.@xcite and calculate the gluon condensate .",
    "the first estimate of the gluon condensate given already in ref.@xcite , @xmath133  mev@xmath134 , is nowadays believed to be too small .",
    "in fact different authors advocated different values for this quantity ( see _ e.g. _ fig.4 of ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for the purpose of this work we adopt more recent estimate from refs.@xcite @xmath135 in our case we shall simply use eq.([ggcond ] ) to calculate @xmath136 and compare with eq.([ggphen ] ) .",
    "it is tempting to use our experience from the wave function calculation to continue eq.([ggcond ] ) to the minkowski space . indeed equations ( [ ggcond ] ) and ( [ qbarqe ] ) differ only by one power of @xmath137 ( apart from trivial numerical factors ) .",
    "this suggests the following generalization of ( [ ggcond ] ) : @xmath138 for a constant @xmath18 eq.([ggcondm ] ) can be easily obtained from ( [ ggcond ] ) by first continuing to the minkowski metric and second by shifting the integration variable by a constant fourvector @xmath79 ( with @xmath139 ) : @xmath140 accepting eq.([ggcondm ] ) as a continuation from the euclidean to the minkowski metric we can calculate the gluon condensate for the cutoff function of eq.([cutform ] ) : @xmath141 the @xmath117 integration is trivial ( note that the large @xmath142 part vanishes due to the properties of the sums of the @xmath114 factors ) .",
    "also the @xmath143 integral is straightforward .",

    "our numerical results are presented in table [ tb : cond ] . for 4 different values of the constituent mass @xmath124 and different @xmath21 ( see eq.([cutform ] ) ) we have adjusted the cutoff parameter @xmath25 by imposing the normalization condition on @xmath120 .",
    "in fact , as discussed at length in ref.@xcite the leading twist pion wave function @xmath147 does not change any more if we increase @xmath21 above @xmath23 . on the other hand for @xmath148 the cutoff function ( [ cutform ] ) ,",
    "if continued to the euclidean metric , starts to deviate significantly from the one obtained in the instanton model .",
    "therefore we have chosen to work with @xmath149 . from our previous study",
    "it seems that the best agreement with the recent analysis of the cleo data is obtained for @xmath150 mev and @xmath151 or @xmath152 mev and @xmath153 .    in the last two columns of table [ tb : cond ]",
    "we have displayed the values of the quark and gluon condensates .",
    "the gluon condensate is quite insensitive to the parameters of the cutoff function and also to the value of the constituent quark mass @xmath18 .",
    "the numerical value being of the order @xmath154@xmath155 mev@xmath156 agrees perfectly with the phenomenological value .",
    "in contrast , the quark condensate is sensitive to the value of @xmath21 and the numerical value lies between @xmath157 and @xmath158 mev@xmath159 overshoots the phenomenological value of @xmath160 mev@xmath159 .",
    "the reason for this sensitivity is relatively broad @xmath24 distribution of @xmath161 .",
    "we shall come back to this point in sect.[s : kt ] .",
    "the function @xmath162 has been calculated within the qcd sum rules in refs.@xcite .",
    "it had a @xmath163 shape and did not vanish at the end points .",
    "in fig.2 we plot our results for @xmath164 .",
    "it can be seen , that for @xmath58 @xmath165 , whereas for @xmath166 @xmath167 .",
    "the end point behavior is governed by the sum @xmath168",
    "\\label{endp}\\ ] ] which vanishes due to the property ( [ fiprop ] ) except for @xmath58 where @xmath169 .",
    ".quark and gluon condensates for different choices of cutoff parameters @xmath170 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in order to estimate the value of the mixed condensate of dimension 5 , @xmath171 , we choose to use the first equation of eqs.([kt2 ] ) .",
    "although this equation is only an approximate one , in the case of no transverse momentum cutoff it gives relatively stable results due to the fast convergence of the @xmath24 integrals . in the case of the finite transverse momentum cutoff",
    "any of the two equations ( [ kt2 ] ) can be used , since the relation ( [ ratio ] ) is fulfilled with good accuracy . in the case of no cutoff ( _ i.e. _ @xmath172 ) we get that ( for @xmath36 from table [ tb : cond ] ) : @xmath173 the value of ( [ c5nocut ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath18 and with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly , for the parameters which are closest to the original instanton model , @xmath152 mev and @xmath153 , we get @xmath174 mev@xmath48 in perfect agreement with the direct calculation of @xmath46 in the instanton model @xcite , which gives @xmath175 mev@xmath48 . in the case of the finite cutoff",
    "the value of @xmath176 is smaller and almost independent of the specific set of parameters ( [ cutform ] ) : @xmath177 this range of values is compatible with the result obtained within the qcd sum rules @xcite at low normalization point : @xmath178 .",
    "in this paper , following our previous work @xcite and refs.@xcite , we have studied a simple , nonperturbative model in which quarks acquire a momentum dependent dynamical mass ( [ cutform ] ) . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have employed this model to calculate the axial - vector leading twist pion light cone wave function , whereas here we have extended our calculations to the case of the pseudo - scalar , twist 3 wave function @xmath179 , which is normalized to the quark condensate . since the model parameters are fixed by the normalization of the axial - vector wave function we could use the normalization condition for @xmath180 to calculate the quark condensate .",
    "one of the advantages of the present model is that one can calculate not only the longitudinal quark distribution in the pion , but also @xmath24 distributions both in the av and ps channels .",
    "therefore we could use the relations between @xmath181 moments and mixed quark gluon condensates @xcite to estimate the latter in the present model .",
    "one remark is here in order .",
    "the advantage of our approach is its simplicity , both conceptual and technical , which makes it possible to compute many quantities analytically .",
    "one might therefore suspect that the model is oversimplified and that our assumptions are too crude to be in general true .",
    "for example the model has no trace of confinement .",
    "it is therefore of importance to perform various tests in order to gain confidence in the model as well as to find its limitations .",
    "this study shows that in fact the model works much better than one might have initially expected . as shown in ref.@xcite @xmath182",
    "is compatible with recent cleo data @xcite ; quark condensate calculated here from the normalization condition of @xmath183 comes out reasonable , although bigger than the phenomenological value .",
    "the gluon condensate , which we have computed from the gap equation ( [ ggcond ] ) guessing the continuation to the minkowski space , comes out very well .",
    "the mixed quark - gluon condensate of dimension 5 calculated from the value of @xmath184 ( see eq.([kt2 ] ) ) is in a surprising agreement with the direct evaluation of @xmath46 in the instanton model @xcite .",
    "an obvious limitation of the model is due to the @xmath24 asymptotics of @xmath185 and also @xmath186 ( [ ktasymp ] ) .",
    "this powerlike behavior makes higher @xmath24 moments divergent , and therefore higher mixed condensates uncalculable .",
    "for @xmath187 the power is still relatively high , whereas for @xmath188 it is rather low .",
    "this is the reason why the quark condensate comes out higher that the phenomenological value and depends ( within a factor of 2 ) on model parameters . since there exists another wave function normalized to @xmath36 , namely @xmath189 @xcite , it would be interesting to calculate @xmath190 from @xmath189 and compare with the present results @xcite . as a remedy for the broadness of @xmath191",
    "we have employed the @xmath24 cutoff , which does not affect much the gluon condensate and @xmath192 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath182 ) but allows to reproduce the phenomenological value of @xmath193 mev@xmath31 .",
    "then the ratio @xmath194 is in agreement with the analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "unfortunately one single cutoff is probably not enough to make all higher moments reliable .",
    "both quark and gluon condensate depend on the scale @xmath195 . in model calculations",
    "it is , however , hard to define precisely what value should be taken for @xmath6 . in the instanton model of the qcd vacuum",
    "the scale is determined by the average inverse size of the instanton @xmath7  mev .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect that also in our case the normalization scale is of the same order .",
    "its connection to the scale @xmath25 entering eq.([cutform ] ) is , however , by no means straightforward since in fact we use various values of @xmath25 and @xmath21 to approximate _ the same _",
    "function @xmath13 evaluated in the instanton model for @xmath7  mev .",
    "one way to determine @xmath196 in the present approach is to identify @xmath197 , where @xmath28 is the transverse cutoff displayed in table  [ tb : zcutoffem ] .",
    "indeed , this is precisely the way how the normalization scale is defined for the light cone wave functions ( see _ e.g. _ ref.@xcite ) .",
    "numerically it comes out that @xmath198 mev .",
    "the twist 3 pion wave function @xmath179 , which we have plotted in fig.2 is theoretically an interesting object , since it tends asymptotically to 1 , and therefore might be enhanced in certain kinematical regions .",
    "the calculations of @xmath183 from the qcd sum rules suggest that it does not vanish at the end points @xcite .",
    "we find this kind of behavior only for @xmath58 ( see eq.([cutform ] ) ) , whereas for @xmath63 @xmath180 vanishes at the end points .",
    "interestingly , the vanishing of @xmath179 for @xmath199 is correlated with the nonconvexity of the axial - vector wave function at the end points , which for @xmath200 ( or @xmath22 ) behaves like @xmath201 ( or @xmath202 ) .",
    "it would be worthwhile to check if this correlation holds also in other models .",
    "the fact , that the axial - vector pion distribution amplitude may be concave at the end points has been already pointed out in ref.@xcite and confirmed by model calculations within the framework of the nonlocal sum rules @xcite .",

    "<S> we use the simple instanton motivated nambu jona - lasinio - type model to calculate a twist 3 pseudo - scalar pion light cone wave function @xmath0 . using the normalization condition for @xmath0 we calculate the quark condensate and also the gluon condensate , which agree with the phenomenological values for these quantities . since we can compute also the @xmath1 dependence of the light cone wave functions , we calculate @xmath1 moments of the pseudo - scalar and axial - vector wave functions which are related to the mixed vacuum condensates . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to extract the condensates and compare them with existing estimates . </S>"
