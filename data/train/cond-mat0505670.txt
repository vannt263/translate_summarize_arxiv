    "one of the central issues in one - dimensional ( 1d ) correlated electron systems is the spin - charge separation  @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the spin and charge degrees of freedom of electrons are decoupled into their collective excitations , spinon and holon  @xcite .",
    "since the single - particle excitations are not quasiparticles , it is expected that these excitations give rise to completely nontrivial physical properties .",
    "experimentally , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) gives direct information on the single - particle excitation spectra .",
    "high - quality arpes measurements under various physical conditions enable us to understand the collective excitations in 1d compounds . recently ,",
    "such arpes mearurements have been performed on a 1d mott insulator srcuo@xmath0 , where the spinon and holon branches have been unambiguously observed  @xcite . in this work",
    ", the spectral weight from the main valence band with o@xmath3 character is suppressed due to cross section effects , and thus the two branches become observable in the low binding - energy region .",
    "the band dispersions of the spinon and holon branches are in good agreement with those predicted in a spin - charge separated model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , careful lineshape analysis reveals that the peak height of the holon branch is smaller than that of the spinon branch , and the full widths at half - maximum of the spinon and holon branches are estimated to be @xmath4 ev and @xmath5 ev , respectively .",
    "temperature dependent arpes studies are also important , because finite - temperature effects on the single - particle excitation spectra of 1d mott insulators are not due to simple thermal broadening . since the single - particle excitation spectra are given by the convolution of the spinon and holon green s functions , the finite - temperature effects reflect their collective nature , not the normal fermi distribution of the quasiparticles .",
    "a temperature dependent arpes study was carried out on na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the spectral weight redistribution from higher to lower binding - energy region was observed when the temperature was decreased from 300 k to 120 k. the redistribution occured on the scale of 1 ev , which was 100 times larger than the temperature change .",
    "the arpes data were consistent with the finite - temperature exact - diagonalization calculations for the 1d @xmath6-@xmath7 model at half - filling , and it was shown that the spin - charge separation picture is valid for na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2 .    in the high - energy arpes measurements on srcuo@xmath0  @xcite ,",
    "it is quite significant to detect the spinon and holon branches directly in the arpes spectrum , because the arpes data enable us to examine the spectral weights and the lifetimes of the spinon and holon in the compound .",
    "the temperature dependent arpes measurement on na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2 tells us how the spectral weights of the spinon and holon are redistributed with changing temperature , though the spinon and holon branches are not resolved in this experiment .",
    "the finite - temperature effect may also appear in the room - temperature arpes data for srcuo@xmath0 .",
    "motivated by these arpes measurements , we examine the single - particle excitation spectra in the 1d hubbard model at half - filling .",
    "we are particularly interested in the temperature dependence of the spinon and holon excitations at temperatures of the order of the magnetic exchange @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is the hopping matrix element and @xmath9 is the onsite coulomb repulsion . in the large-@xmath9 limit",
    ", the single - particle spectral weight was obtained in refs .",
    "however , in the limit , the spinon excitations are not expected to exhibit temperature dependence .",
    "therefore , such a simplified picture of the large-@xmath9 limit is not relevant for our discussion .    in order to study the temperature dependence",
    ", we calculate the single - particle spectral weight of the 1d half - filled hubbard model by using the determinantal quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the maximum - entropy analytic continuation methods . for a complementary study to the qmc and a check of validity of our analytic continuation results",
    ", we also perform dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) calculations for the spectral weight at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "it is noted that the single - particle spectrum of the 1d hubbard model has been previously studied by using the qmc and the maximum - entropy techniques @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the single - particle spectrum and density of states were calculated for @xmath10 and @xmath11 at half - filling and at @xmath12 doping .",
    "in addition , the velocities for the spin and charge excitations were obtained from the frequency and momentum dependences of the spin and charge susceptibilities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the general features of the single - particle spectrum were discussed for @xmath13 and @xmath14 at half - filling . in these qmc data , however , the spinon and holon branches on the single - particle excitation spectrum were not resolved .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the @xmath9 dependence of the spectral weight at zero temperature which was obtained by using the ddmrg method . in section iii ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the spinon and holon excitations is discussed by combining the ddmrg and qmc results .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to resolve the spinon and holon excitations in the single - particle excitation spectrum of the 1d hubbard model at half - filling using the qmc and the maximum - entropy techniques .",
    "the discussion and summary are given in section iv .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) annihilates ( creates ) an electron with spin @xmath18 at lattice site @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath6 is the hopping integral along the chain axis , and @xmath9 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "we consider the half - filled case .    in this section , we show the @xmath9 depencence of the spectral weights of the spinon and holon branches at zero temperature .",
    "the results will be helpful for understanding the @xmath9-dependence of the temperature evolution of the spinon and holon branches in the next section .",
    "the single - particle spectral weight is defined by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum representation of the electron operator with spin @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the ground state and the eigenenergy , respectively , and @xmath27 is a small positive number .    in the ddmrg method ,",
    "the superblock is set to be 64 sites , and we use the open boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "this is because the standard dmrg method gives the most precise numerical results when the open boundary condition is applied .",
    "however , there is a boundary effect , which makes a photohole localized at the ends of the 1d chain . for the single - particle spectral weight ,",
    "it is not so easy to remove the boundary effect by increasing the system size .",
    "thus , we add a potential of @xmath28 to the ends in order to remove the boundary effect .",
    "it is noted that the spinon branch is almost unchanged by the potential , while the holon branch is shifted to higher binding - energy region by the order of @xmath29 .",
    "the momentum representation of the electron operator , @xmath23 , in the open boundary system is defined by @xmath30 in terms of an expansion in particle - in - a - box eigenstates , where @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the system size . in the infinite - chain limit , @xmath34 ,",
    "this transformation becomes equivalent to the standard fourier transformation .",
    "it may be technically useful to note how to count the fermion sign when the state @xmath35 is generated , because the number of electrons at each site is neither 1 nor 0 in the ddmrg bases of @xmath25 . instead of @xmath36",
    ", we use an annihilation operator , @xmath37 , which includes the fermion sign caused by the hopping from the @xmath38-th site to one end of the system ( environment ) block  @xcite .",
    "the density matrix we introduce is composed of four target states , i.e. , the ground state @xmath39 , the final state after annihilation of an electron @xmath40 , and two correction vectors @xmath41 and @xmath42 being @xmath43 .",
    "the method is the so - called two correction vector method  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the correction vectors are calculated by using the modified conjugate gradient method . by using these four target states , the density matrix @xmath44 for each @xmath45",

    "we have checked that the results are almost unchanged for other sets of @xmath52 .",
    "the ddmrg bases are truncated from the eigenstates of this density matrix .",
    "our method is equivalent to the variational principle for the mixed states  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath44 depends on @xmath45 , the truncated bases are optimized independently for each @xmath45 .",
    "this is the reason why the renormalization works well for dynamical quantities .",
    "the truncation number which is sufficient for convergence depends also on @xmath45 . here , the ddmrg bases are truncated up to @xmath53 .",
    "after convergence of the finite - system dmrg algorithm , we obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 . at the same time , the spectral weights at an energy interval @xmath56 are calculated by using the same @xmath26 and @xmath57 .",
    "the broadening factor is set to be @xmath58 , which is less than temperatures treated in the next section .",
    "it is noted that the two correction vector method is efficient , but we need a higher truncation number than that in the standard ddmrg with a single correction vector .",
    "then , we check the convergency for some @xmath45 points by using three target states with the single correction vector and by taking the truncation number up to @xmath59 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the @xmath9 dependence of the spectral weight at @xmath60 , which is the smallest momentum in the open boundary system . in finite-@xmath9 cases ,",
    "we find two peaks at the band edges .",
    "the peaks at low and high binding - energy sides correspond to the spinon and holon excitations , respectively , because both peak positions are equal to those predicted by the bethe - anzats solutions . in this figure , these peaks do no show clear branch cuts due to the finite broadening factor of @xmath58 .",
    "however , we have checked that the edge singularities at the peak positions become observable with smaller values of @xmath27 .    in the case of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , the peak height of the spinon ( holon ) branch is larger than that of the holon ( spinon ) branch . in the finite-@xmath9 cases ,",
    "the spectral shape of the holon branch is almost unchanged , while the weight of the spinon branch rapidly decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "here , we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath63 of the 1d hubbard model . for this purpose , we present data obtained by using the determinantal qmc technique @xcite . with this method",
    ", we have calculated the single - particle green s function @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes thermal averaging , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the matsubara time - ordering operator . for temperature @xmath68 ( inverse temperature @xmath69 ) , the integral equation @xmath70 expresses @xmath71 in terms of the single - particle spectral weight @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the fermion matsubara frequency .",

    "we also present results on the static magnetic susceptibility at zero frequency , @xmath75 , which is defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the determinantal qmc technique does not have the `` fermion sign problem '' @xcite at half - filling or in the 1d case .",
    "however , the qmc algorithm which proceeds by using local updates of the hubbard - stratonovich spins produces results with long autocorrelation times at low temperatures and for large values of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that this is because the determinantal qmc algorithm with single - spin - flip moves does not explore the phase space in an ergodic manner for large values of @xmath79 . in order to remove this problem ,",
    "global monte carlo moves have been introduced , and this way the antiferromagnetic structure factor for the @xmath80 hubbard lattice was calculated for @xmath9 up to @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of global moves on dynamical quantities have not been explored .",
    "because of these reasons , we have restricted our qmc calculations , which use single - spin - flip moves , to parameter regimes where we did not observe ergodicity problems . in the following , we present qmc data on @xmath63 for @xmath10 at @xmath82 and for @xmath83 at @xmath84 , and make comparisons with the ddmrg data obtained at @xmath85 .    in obtaining @xmath63 from qmc data on @xmath71",

    "it is noted that the momenta which we can access in the ddmrg method are different from those in the qmc method , because different boundary conditions are taken into account in these methods in order to keep numerical precision . then , the qmc result with momentum @xmath88 is compared with the ddmrg one with momentum @xmath89 , and the qmc result with @xmath90 is also compared with the ddmrg one with the smallest momentum @xmath91 . in order to make the difference small",

    "<S> motivated by the recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on one - dimensional mott insulators , srcuo@xmath0 and na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2 , we examine the single - particle spectral weight of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model at half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in the temperature dependence of the spinon and holon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we have performed the dynamical density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations for the single - particle spectral weight of the 1d hubbard model . in the qmc data , </S>",
    "<S> the spinon and holon branches become observable at temperatures where the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations develop . at these temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , the spinon branch grows rapidly . in the light of the numerical results , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the spinon and holon branches observed by the arpes experiments on srcuo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results are also in agreement with the temperature dependence of the arpes results on na@xmath1v@xmath0o@xmath2 . </S>"
