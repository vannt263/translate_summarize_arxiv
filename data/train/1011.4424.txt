    "this paper is concerned with the notion of the optimality of bounds on the rotation of spectral subspaces of positive definite hermitian matrix pairs under the influence of additive perturbations .",
    "precisely , given positive definite hermitian matrix pairs @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their spectral subspaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the same dimensionality we provide estimates @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the usual relative distance between positive definite hermitian matrices @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 measure the gaps in the spectrum and @xmath9 measures the size of the rotation in the scalar product @xmath10 dependent on the matrix @xmath11 .",
    "for more on @xmath12 theorems see @xcite . in comparison , we approach the problem of the changing scalar product by presenting our estimates in the @xmath11-scalar product , whereas the standard approach yields estimates in the euclidean scalar product .",
    "let us now consider the notion of the optimality of perturbation estimates in the context of parameter dependent perturbation families . in this",
    "setting we analyze rotations of eigenspaces of positive definite hermitian matrix pairs @xmath13 under the influence of a parameter dependent family of perturbations .",
    "the allowed families of perturbations @xmath14 and @xmath15  where @xmath16 is some indexing parameter  are assumed to satisfy the restrictions @xmath17 here the matrix valued functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed to take value in the space of hermitian matrices of appropriate size , and by a convention @xmath18 denotes the transpose or hermitian transpose of an object @xmath19  be it matrix or vector  as is given by the context .",
    "we also assume that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are some real valued functions and we apply ( [ eq : i1 ] ) by setting @xmath22 and @xmath23 and noting the estimates @xmath24 and @xmath25 if we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is our aim to argue that matrix dependent scalar product gives a natural environment to obtain optimal convergence estimates as functions of the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "further feature of our theory is that our estimates are invariant does not change under this transformation of the problem . ] to the `` inversion of the problem '' , so we can also obtain estimates in the @xmath28 based scalar product by switching the roles of @xmath28 and @xmath11 . in this context the reader should also note that the identity ( [ assup:1 ] ) , under the assumption that @xmath16 is such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 yields the estimates ( cf . equation ( [ cf_eq ] ) ) @xmath31    let us now give more insight into the applications which are covered by the assumptions ( [ assup:1 ] ) .",
    "this structure is rich enough to include discretization matrices approximating several singularly perturbed families of problems appearing in mathematical physics . among other applications ,",
    "the penalty methods for stokes and maxwell equations from @xcite can be analyzed in this context , too .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is then called the penalty parameter , and it is of interest what happens to the eigenvalues and eigenspaces as @xmath32 . in (",
    "* section 4 ) the authors have studied the perturbation of eigenvalues by a very elegant gerschgorin type argument and in this paper we give an eigenspace counterpart of such a result . for more details",
    "see [ app ] and the explicitly solved academic model problems from section [ acc1 ] .    also , the effect of numerical integration on the rotation of eigenspaces , when assembling finite element mass and stiffness matrices , is covered by ( [ assup:1 ] ) . in this context",
    "@xmath16 is the parameter describing the effect of increasing accuracy of the integration formula .",
    "this approach is also used for `` mass lumping '' which amounts to constructing a diagonal matrix @xmath33 , with @xmath34 small in some sense . for further information and references",
    "see the paper @xcite , [ app ] and the academic example from section [ acc2 ] where we rather favorably compare our results with those that follow from the standard reference @xcite .",
    "we end this discussion by noting that similar energy norm estimates for eigenvectors have been obtained in @xcite in the context of the analysis of laczos method .",
    "furthermore , the authors show how to efficiently compute the ingredients of the estimator in the context of computationally competitive numerical linear algebra procedures .",
    "we extend some of those results by giving a subspace version of some of the estimates , e.g. see appropriate parts of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.3 and 3.4 ) and compare with our numerical results from section [ num ] .",
    "it is possible that our subspace results could be of technical help when developing a similar analysis of the block lanczos method .",
    "we now turn to the main question of this paper .",
    "what is the real nature of the sharpness claim of a @xmath12 theorem ?",
    "many of such theorems are obtained under essentially different spectral assumptions .",
    "each is claimed to be sharp by constructing an appropriate example where the bound is attained .",
    "the results can not be readily compared , even though one class of results can be seen to be following from the other , since their optimality depends on the set of assumption which were necessary to obtain the results .",
    "quantitatively , transforming one class of results into the other type of estimates changes the quantitative performance of the results so considerably that a direct comparison is no longer fair . in a sense , each result is `` sharp '' given the setting in which it has been obtained so discussion is more about which set of assumptions are more appropriate than the others .",
    "we do not further address this fundamental questions .",
    "instead , we opt to normalize the estimates by dividing the measure of the rotation which is being estimated with the estimator and then compare various estimates on specially tailored model problems . a first logical candidate",
    " in a single matrix case  for a competing estimate would be a @xmath12 theorem from @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out that this estimate  as the function of @xmath16  is overly pessimistic .",
    "our aim is in particular to derive sharp estimates for the rotation of eigenspaces for this class of problems given by the parameter dependent family @xmath35 .",
    "the solution is to look for the rotation of eigenspaces in the energy norm , that is @xmath28 based . in our setting",
    "this boils down to the analysis of the matrix pair @xmath36 .",
    "let us also point out that we will discuss sharpness , or lack of it , in the various @xmath12 results by comparing the residual type estimates which can be obtained for matrix pairs @xmath37 we will conclude that any estimate of an eigenspace rotation under the assumptions ( [ assup:1 ] ) is actually meant to be in a matrix dependent scalar product and that it will under - perform if used to measure rotations in the euclidean scalar product .",
    "the optimal setting to consider all of the above eigenvector problems is an analysis of the whole class of positive definite matrix pairs @xmath0 , where @xmath28 and @xmath11 are positive definite .",
    "more to the point , we consider the following generalized eigenvector problem @xmath38 and the corresponding perturbed one @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 are hermitian positive definite .      under these assumptions",
    "matrix pairs @xmath0 can be simultaneously diagonalized , that is there exists a non - singular matrix @xmath43 such that @xmath44 where @xmath45 for @xmath46 and we use @xmath47 to denote the hermitian adjoint",
    ".    we will represent our perturbation problem by block operator matrices and will use the following notation for the perturbation problems which will be needed in the analysis . let us decompose @xmath43 and @xmath48 as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the eigen - decomposition ( [ diagpar1 ] )",
    "can now be written as @xmath52 similarly as above , for perturbed quantities one can write @xmath53 and @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the size of the perturbations @xmath58 and @xmath34 will be measured in the relative sense .",
    "this means that we assume that we have information on the singular values of the matrices @xmath59 or @xmath60 typically we only use the maximal singular value , that is the spectral norm estimate of these relative perturbations .",
    "more to the point we will use the quantities defined in the lemma below in most of our arguments . in this paper",
    "we use @xmath61 to denote the spectral matrix norm , and @xmath62 to denote any unitary invariant matrix norm , when there is no danger of confusion .",
    "[ lem1 ] let @xmath28 be a positive definite matrix and let @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then for any @xmath65 @xmath66 in particular , relation ( [ zadnja ] ) reduces to @xmath67 in the case @xmath68 .",
    "the proof is by direct computation , see also @xcite .",
    "let us note that our theory is not limited to the use of spectral norm only .",
    "we allow for the consideration of any unitary invariant norm of the perturbations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "when there is a danger of confusion we will use the notation @xmath69 to denote the dependence of the perturbation measure on the unitary invariant norm .    [ l2lumping ] let us note that in an application of this theory in the setting of the mass lumping finite element methods we consider the perturbations of the @xmath11 matrix .",
    "the constant @xmath70 for such a perturbation typically depends on mesh parameters . furthermore , let us note that if there exist constants @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 such that @xmath74 holds for some symmetric positive definite matrices @xmath75 and @xmath11 , then @xmath76 has the property @xmath77 which can be written as @xmath78      let us now define the basic tools which will be used to compare subspaces of @xmath79 .",

    "typically , one compares the subspaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 by analyzing the spectral properties of the product @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath82-singular values of @xmath91the restriction of @xmath92 on @xmath80are called the sines of the angle between the subspaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in the matrix notation",

    "we analyze the angles between the subspaces @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the scalar product @xmath94 , @xmath65 which is defined by the positive definite matrix @xmath11 . to this end",

    "let us not that since both @xmath11 and @xmath28 are subject to perturbation particular care is needed because the underlying space geometry changes with @xmath11 .",
