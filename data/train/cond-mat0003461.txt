    "explaining how proteins self - assemble into well defined structures is a longstanding challenge .",
    "energy landscape theory and the funnel concept @xcite have provided the theoretical framework necessary for improving our understanding of this problem  efficient folding sequences minimize frustration .",
    "frustration may arise from the inability to satisfy all native interactions and from strong non - native contacts which can create conformational traps .",
    "the difficulty of minimizing energetic frustration by sequence design , however , is also dependent on the choice of folding motif .",
    "some folding motifs are easier to design than others @xcite , suggesting the possibility that evolution not only selected sequences with sufficiently small energetic frustration but also selected more easily designable native structures .",
    "to address this difference in foldability , we have introduced the concept of `` topological frustration '' @xcite  even when sequences have been designed with minimal energetic frustration , variations in the degree of nativeness of contacts in the transition state ensemble ( tse ) are observed because of asymmetries imposed by the chosen final structure .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental evidences suggest that proteins , especially small fast folding ( sub - millisecond ) proteins , have sequences with a sufficiently reduced level of energetic frustration that the global characteristics of the observed heterogeneity observed in the tse are strongly influenced by the native state topology .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the overall structure of the tse for _ chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 _ ( ci2 ) and for the sh3 domain of the _ src tyrosine - protein kinease _ can be obtained by using simplified models constructed by using sequences that have almost no energetic frustration ( g  like potentials ) .",
    "these models drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity for native contacts , leaving the topology as the primary source of the residual frustration .",
    "topological effects , however , go beyond affecting the structure of the tse .",
    "the overall structure of the populated intermediate state ensembles during the folding of proteins such as _ barnase _ , _ ribonuclease h _ and _ chey _ have also been successfully determined using a similar model @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that although these model , since they consider totally unfrustrated sequences , may not reproduce the precise energetics of the real proteins , such as the value of the barrier heights and the stability of the intermediates , they are able to determine the general structure of these ensembles . therefore , the fact that these almost energetically unfrustrated models reproduce most of the major features of the tse of these proteins indicate that real protein sequences are sufficiently well designed ( i.e. with reduced energetic frustration ) that much of the heterogeneity observed in the tse s and intermediates have a strong topological dependence .",
    "do these conclusions hold to larger and slower folding proteins with a more complex folding kinetics than two  state folders as ci2 and sh3 ?",
    "the success obtained with _ barnase _",
    ", _ ribonuclease h _ and _ chey _ intermediates already provides some encouragement  topology appears to be important in determining on - pathway folding intermediates . in this paper",
    "this approach is extended to a pair of larger proteins : _ dihydrofolate reductase _ ( dhfr ) and _ interleukin_-1@xmath0 ( il-1@xmath0 ) .",
    "the synoptic analysis of these two proteins is particularly interesting because they have a comparable size ( slightly over 150 amino  acids ) , but different native structures , folding mechanisms and functions : dhfr is a two ",
    "domain @xmath1/@xmath0 enzyme that maintains pools of tetrahydrofolate used in nucleotide metabolism while il-1@xmath0 is a single domain all @xmath0 cytokine with no catalytic activity on its own but elicits a biological response by binding to its receptor .",
    "the energetically unfrustrated model of dhfr and il-1@xmath0 are constructed by using a g  like hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "a g  like potential takes into account only native interactions , and each of these interactions enters in the energy balance with the same weight .",
    "residues in the proteins are represented as single beads centered in their c@xmath1 positions .",
    "adjacent beads are strung together into a polymer chain by means of bond and angle interactions , while the geometry of the native state is encoded in the dihedral angle potential and a non - local bead - bead potential .",
    "a detailed description of this energy function can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the local ( torsion ) and non - local terms have been adjust so that the stabilization energy residing in the tertiary contacts is approximately twice as large as the torsional contribution .",
    "this balance among the energy terms is optimal for the folding of our g  like protein models @xcite .",
    "solvent mediation and side chain effects are already included in these effective energy functions .",
    "therefore , entropy changes are associated to the configurational entropy of the chain .",
    "the native contact map of a protein is derived with the csu software , based upon the approach developed in ref .",
    "native contacts between pairs of residues @xmath2 with @xmath3 are discarded from the native map as any three and four subsequent residues are already interacting in the angle and dihedral terms .",
    "a contact between two residues @xmath2 is considered formed if the distance between the @xmath4s is shorter than @xmath5 times their native distance @xmath6 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the results are not strongly dependent on the choice made for the cut  off distance @xmath5 . in this work we used @xmath7 .",
    "for both ( dhfr and il-1@xmath0 ) protein models , folding and unfolding simulations have been performed at several temperatures around the folding temperature .",
    "the results from the different simulations have been combined using the wham algorithm @xcite .",
    "several very different initial unfolded structures for the folding simulations have been selected and they have been obtained from high temperature unfolding simulations . in order to have appropriate statistics , we made sure that for every transition state ensemble or intermediate , we have sampled about 500 uncorrelated conformations ( thermally weighted ) . for smaller proteins such as sh3 and ci2 ( that have about 1/3 of the tertiary contacts of dhfr and il-1@xmath0 )",
    "we have determined that about 200 uncorrelated conformations in the transition state ensemble are necessary to have an error on the estimates of contact probabilities ( or @xmath8 values ) of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "_ dihydrofolate reductase _ and _ interleukin_-1@xmath0 not only have dissimilar native folds - strands and 4 @xmath1-helices , grouped together in the folded state in as detailed in fig.[fig3:fig ]  ( d ) , while il-1@xmath0 is a 153 residues , all-@xmath0 protein , composed by 12 @xmath0 strands packed together as shown in fig.[fig4:fig ]  ( c)-(d ) . ] but also the nature of the intermediate states populated during the folding event is remarkably different . to explore the connection between the protein topology and the nature of the intermediates",
    ", we used an energetically minimally frustrated @xmath4 model for these two proteins , with a potential energy function defined by considering only the native local and non - local interactions as being attractive ( see numerical procedures , for details ) .",
    "this is a very simplified potential that retains only information about the native fold  energetic frustration is almost fully removed .",
    "notice that although the real amino  acid sequence is not included in this model , the chosen potential is like a `` perfect '' sequence for the target structure , without the energetic frustration of real sequences ( since this potential includes attractive native tertiary contacts , it implicitly incorporates hydrophobic interactions ) .",
    "therefore , this model provide us with the perfect computational tool to investigate how much of the structural heterogeneity observed during folding mechanism could be inferred from the knowledge of the native structure alone without contributions from energetic frustration . since early work suggests that proteins ( at least small fast folding proteins ) have sufficiently reduced energetic frustration , they have a funnel - like energy landscape with a solvent  averaged potential strongly correlated with the degree of nativeness ( but with some roughness due to the residual frustration ) .",
    "in this situation , the folding dynamics can be described as the diffusion of an ensemble of protein configurations over a low dimensional free energy surface  defined in terms of the reaction coordinate @xmath10 , where @xmath10 represents the fraction of the native contact formed in a conformation ( @xmath11 at the fully unfolded state and @xmath12 at the folded state ) @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of intermediates observed in this free energy profile are expected to mimic the real kinetic intermediates .",
    "[ fig1:fig ] shows a comparison between the folding mechanism obtained from our simulations for the minimally - frustrated analogue of dhfr ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) and il-1@xmath0 ( panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) . the different nature of the folding intermediates of the two proteins and their native ensembles emerging from these data is in substantial agreement with the experimental observations , with the adenine binding domain of dhfr being folded in the main intermediate in the simulation and the central @xmath0 strands of il-1@xmath0 being formed early in this single domain protein .",
    "the absolute values of the free energy barriers resulting from simulations may not necessarily agree with the experimental ones because we are dealing with unfrustrated designed sequences .",
    "thus , quantitative predictions that depend on barrier heights and stability of the intermediate ensembles ( e.g. folding time , rate determining barriers and lifetime of intermediates ) are not possible for this kind of models .",
    "however we show that topology is sufficient to correctly detect the positions of the transition state and intermediate states . a more detailed description follows .",
    "the folding process emerging from the dynamics of the g  like analogue of dhfr ( as summarized in fig .",

    "refolding initiates by a barrierless collapse to a quasi ",
    "stable species ( q=0.2 ) which corresponds to the formation of a burst  phase intermediate , @xmath13 , with little stability but some protection from @xmath14-exchange across the central @xmath0 sheet  @xcite .",

    "@xmath16 are structurally similar to each other , but differentiated experimentally by the rate at which they proceed towards the native protein .",
    "finally , after the overcoming of a second barrier , the protein visits an ensemble of native structures with different energies .",
    "the experimentally determined folding mechanism of dhfr shows transient kinetic control in the formation of native conformers ( @xmath17 dominant ) .",
    "this is later overridden by thermodynamic considerations ( @xmath18 dominant ) at final equilibrium @xcite .",

    "[ fig2:fig ]  ( b ) a set of structures close to to the native state ( q around 0.7 - 0.8 ) is transiently populated beside the fully folded state ( q = 1 ) . since the main intermediate @xmath15 has been recently characterized by experimental studies @xcite , we take our analysis a step farther by comparing the average structure of the @xmath15 ensemble from our simulations to the one experimentally determined . for this purpose",
    "we compute the formation probability @xmath19 for each native dhfr contact involving residues @xmath2 at different stages of the folding process by averaging the number of times the contact occurs over the set of structures existent in a selected range of @xmath10 . as detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig3:fig ] , the central result from this analysis is that the main intermediate @xmath15 is characterized by a largely different degree of formation in different parts of the protein : _ domain 1 _",
    "( i.e. interactions among strands 2 - 5 and helices 2 - 3 ) appears to be formed with probability greater than 0.7 while _ domain 2 _",
    "( i.e. interactions among strands 6 - 8 , helix 1 and helix 4 ) is almost non existent .",
    "the formation of _ domain 1 _ and _ domain 2 _ during the folding event is more closely understood from fig .",
    "[ fig2:fig ] ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) , where the rms distance of the parts of the protein constituting each _ domain _ from the corresponding native structures is shown for a typical folding simulation .",
    "indeed the two _ domains _ fold in a noticeably different way : in the stable intermediate @xmath15 , _ domain 1 _ is closer than 5   ( rms ) to that found in the native structure while _ domain 2 _ is highly variable ( rms distance greater than 15   from its native structure ) .",
    "still , in agreement with hydrogen exchange studies @xcite , some protection is expected across domains from our simulations and complete protection from exchange is expected only after the formation of the fully folded protein . a combination of fluorescence , cd mutagenic and new drug binding studies on dhfr indeed",
    "demonstrate that _ domain 1 _ is largely folded with specific tertiary contacts formed and that this collection of intermediates is obligatory in the folding route @xcite .",
    "supported by some recent experiments , heidary et al @xcite have proposed a kinetic mechanism for the folding of il-1@xmath0 that requires the presence of a well defined on - pathway intermediate species .",
    "the structural details of these species were determined from nmr and hydrogen exchange techniques @xcite . we have compared these experimental data with our simulations for the il-1@xmath0 g  like analogue ( fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig ]  ( b ) and",
    "the folding picture emerging from these numerical studies differs substantially from that observed for dhfr ( see panels ( a ) and ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1:fig ] ) .",
    "an intermediate state is populated for @xmath10 around 0.55 , followed by a rate limiting barrier ( around @xmath20 ) after which the system proceeds to the well defined native state .",
    "is the theoretical intermediate similar to the one observed experimentally ? using the same procedure employed for the dhfr , a comparison between the average structure of the il-1@xmath0 intermediate ensemble and the one emerging from experimental studies is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4:fig ] .",
    "these results indicate that the calculated intermediate has residues 40 - 105 ( strands 4 - 8 ) folded into a native - like topology but with interactions between strands 5 and 8 not fully completed .",
    "experimental results confirm that strands 6 - 8 are well folded in the intermediate state and that strands 4 - 5 are partially formed .",
    "however results of experiments and theory differ in the region between residues 110 - 125 where hydrogen exchange shows early protection and theory predicts late contact formation .",
    "this region contains 4 aromatic groups phe 112 , phe 117 , tyr 120 , trp 121 which may be sequestered from solvent due to clustering of these residues and from removal from unfavorable solvent interactions .",
    "this effect would not be fully accounted for our model , where all native interactions are considered as energetically equivalent and large stabilizing interactions are not differentiated .",
    "thus , energetics may favor early formation of the structure corresponding to residues 105 - 125 while topology considerations favor the formation of strands 4 - 8 .",
    "theoretical and experimental studies of protein folding at times appear to be at odds .",
    "theoretical analysis of simple model systems oftentimes predict a large number of routes to the native protein whereas experimental work on larger systems indicates that folding proceeds through a limited number of intermediate species .",
    "although in the eyes of some people these two descriptions are inconsistent with each other , this is clearly not true .",
    "the large number of routes may or may not lead to the production of on - route kinetic intermediate ensembles depending on the result of the competition between configurational entropy and the effective folding energy . in this study , we show that productive intermediate species are produced by using simplified protein models , with funnel - like landscapes , based on purely topological considerations and the results are in good agreement with the available experimental data . the fact that these simplified minimally frustrated models for dhfr and il-1@xmath0 can predict the overall features of the folding intermediates and transition states experimentally measured for these two proteins , with completely different folding mechanisms and functions , support our general picture that real proteins have a substantially reduced level of energetic frustration and a large component of the observed heterogeneity during the folding event is topologically determined .",
    "such observations lead us to propose that the success in designing sequences that fold to a particular shape is constrained by topological effects .",
    "what is more challenging are the consequences of this conclusion  are these topological constraints something that only have to be tolerated during the folding event or are they actually used by biology towards helping function ? here",
