    "the main idea of the renormalization group ( hereafter rg ) approach to field theory is to `` integrate out '' all fluctuations with momenta larger than some cutoff @xmath3 , and to take them into account by means of a modified dynamics for the remaining fluctuation modes with momenta smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "this modified dynamics is governed by a scale - dependent effective action @xmath4 , the @xmath3-dependence of which is described by a functional differential equation , the exact rg equation .",
    "flow equations can be used for a complete quantization of fundamental theories . if the latter have the classical action @xmath5 one imposes the initial condition @xmath6 at the ultraviolet ( uv ) cut - off scale @xmath7 , uses the exact rg equation to compute @xmath4 for all @xmath8 , and then sends @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the defining property of a fundamental theory is that the `` continuum limit '' @xmath10 actually exists after the renormalization of finitely many parameters in the action .",
    "interestingly , there are also perturbatively non - renormalizable theories which admit a @xmath10 limit .",
    "the `` continuum limit '' of these theories is taken at a non - gaussian fixed point of the rg flow .",
    "it replaces the gaussian fixed point which , at least implicitly , underlies the construction of perturbatively renormalizable theories .",
    "recently , lauscher and reuter@xmath11 have constructed a new exact rg equation for the effective average action of euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "they have found both a gaussian and a non - gaussian fixed point .",
    "a strong evidence has been therefore obtained in favour of 4-dimensional einstein gravity being asymptotically safe.@xmath12 here , the key question we study is _ how to achieve a modification of the standard adm lagrangian where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dynamical variables according to a prescribed renormalized trajectory_. moreover , we are interested in the cosmological applications of such a framework.@xmath13",
    "we here use the adm hamiltonian treatment of space - time geometry .",
    "thus , the identity @xmath14 where @xmath15 , suggests using the leibniz rule to express @xmath16 so that division by @xmath17 in the integrand of the einstein - hilbert action yields the lagrangian ( the @xmath18 factor in the numerator is set to @xmath19 with our choice of units ) @xmath20d^{3}x , \\label{(3)}\\ ] ] after adding to the action functional the boundary term @xmath21 , and assuming that @xmath22 is a closed manifold .",
    "the lagrangian ( 3 ) , however , suffers from a serious drawback , because the resulting momentum conjugate to the three - metric reads as @xmath23 this would yield , in turn , a hamiltonian containing a term quadratic in @xmath24 ( since @xmath25 depends also on @xmath26 ) , despite the fact that ( 3 ) is only linear in @xmath24 when expressed in terms of first and second fundamental forms .",
    "there is therefore a worrying lack of equivalence between @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "we thus decide to include a `` bulk '' contribution in order to cancel the effect of @xmath24 and @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) by writing @xmath29 as a starting action defining a gravitational theory with variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , upon division by @xmath17 in the integrand of the einstein ",
    "hilbert term ( first integral in eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) , the second and third integral in eq . ( 5 ) cancel the effect of @xmath30 and @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , respectively .",
    "the resulting lagrangian density belongs to the general family depending only on fields and their first derivatives , which is the standard assumption in local field theory .",
    "it should also be noticed that if @xmath0 were constant , the second integral on the right - hand side of ( 5 ) would reduce to the york ",
    "gibbons  hawking boundary term @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , we are trying to generalize the standard adm lagrangian in order to consider @xmath0 as a _ dynamical field _ and investigate which dynamics is consistent with the rg approach . in this spirit",
    "we consider hereafter the following general adm lagrangian : @xmath33d^{3}x + l_{\\rm int}+l_{\\rm matter } , \\label{(6)}\\ ] ] where the first term has the same functional form as the lagrangian of adm general relativity ( but with @xmath0 and @xmath1 promoted to dynamical variables ) , @xmath34 is an interaction term of a kinetic type which , for dimensional reasons , must be of the form ( the coefficient @xmath35 is introduced for later convenience ) @xmath36 @xmath37 being the interaction parameter .",
    "@xmath38 is the `` matter '' lagrangian that we shall consider as given by a self - interacting scalar field .",
    "on using the adm formalism , we take a scalar - field lagrangian @xmath39d^{3}x , \\label{(8)}\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath40 is , for the time being , un - determined , and @xmath41 is negative with our convention for the space - time metric .",
    "we focus , hereafter , on cosmological models with rw symmetry . strictly speaking ,",
    "such a name can be criticized , since we are no longer studying general relativity , nor are we simply rg - improving the einstein equations .",
    "nevertheless , we will find that spatially homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models of the rw class can still be achieved .",
    "in such models with lapse function @xmath42 , the full lagrangian , including scalar field , reads as ( here @xmath43 for a closed , spatially flat or open universe , respectively ) @xmath44 where hereafter we revert to dots , for simplicity , to denote derivatives with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the resulting second - order evolution equations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48 & & \\mu{\\ddot g } -{3\\over 2}\\mu { { \\dot g}^2\\over g } + 3\\mu{\\dot a \\over a } { \\dot g }    + { g \\over 2 } \\left(-6{{\\dot a}^{2}\\over a^{2 } } + 6{{\\cal k } \\over a^{2}}-2\\lambda   + 2g{d \\lambda \\over d g}\\right)=0 , \\label{eqg}\\\\[2 mm ] & & { \\ddot \\phi}+3{{\\dot a}\\over a}{\\dot \\phi } + { dv \\over d\\phi}=0 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , since the lagrangian ( 6 ) is independent of time derivatives of the lapse , one has the primary constraint of vanishing conjugate momentum to @xmath49 . the preservation in time of such a primary constraint yields , for our lagrangian generated from the assumption of rw symmetry , the constraint equation @xmath50    in cosmology",
    ", the postulate of homogeneity and isotropy implies that the rg scale dependence is turned into a time dependence : @xmath51 .",
    "the explicit law is @xmath52 , @xmath53 being a positive constant , because , when the age of the universe is @xmath45 , no fluctuation with a frequency smaller than @xmath54 can have played any role as yet .",
    "hence the integrating - out of modes which underlies the wilson renormalization group should be stopped at @xmath55 . in the neighbourhood of a fixed point @xmath56 the evolution of the dimensionful @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "is approximately given by @xmath57 .",
    "we therefore obtain the time - dependent newton parameter and cosmological term : @xmath58    unlike models where only the einstein equations are rg - improved , our framework allows for a non - trivial dynamics of the scale factor even in the absence of coupling to an external field.@xmath59 to appreciate this point , consider first the case when no scalar field exists , so that eq .",
    "( 12 ) should not be considered .",
    "the relation ( 14 ) suggests looking for power - law solutions of the type @xmath60 and separately consider the @xmath61 and @xmath62 case .",
    "for @xmath61 we obtain that @xmath63 is an un - determined factor , while ( from eq .",
    "( 13 ) ) @xmath64 which implies a power - law inflation for the `` @xmath65 '' solution , @xmath66 being larger than @xmath19 if @xmath67 , and a possible solution of the horizon problem .",
    "note that the first equality is a relation between coupling constants which has to be satisfied , while the second simply relates the value of @xmath68 with the product @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath53 is not determined , @xmath66 can be made arbitrarily large . moreover ,",
    "both @xmath70 and @xmath71 are constant , since @xmath72    if @xmath62 we find instead @xmath73 and @xmath74 where , as before , the former equation relates the values of the coupling constants , while the latter is a consistency relation .",
    "in particular we see that , if @xmath75 , then @xmath76 must be negative .",
    "in both cases ( i.e. @xmath62 ) , @xmath71 and @xmath70 are constant with @xmath77    next we consider the contribution of a scalar field with a self - interacting potential of the type @xmath78 , with the ansatz ( 15 ) for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 for the scalar field . the klein ",
    "gordon equation of motion ( 12 ) then yields @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which implies @xmath83 so as to have a real scalar field .",
    "we then find , if @xmath61 , @xmath84 & & \\zeta_\\pm = \\frac {   24 g_\\star\\pi[3\\xi^2\\lambda_\\star-3\\mu^{2}+5\\mu   \\pm ( 1-\\mu)\\sqrt{3\\mu ( 3\\mu-4)-6\\xi^2\\lambda_\\star } ] }   { \\xi^2(3\\xi^2\\lambda_\\star + 2(3 - 2\\mu)\\mu ) } , \\label{(21)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( 21 ) is a consistency relation , ( 20 ) determines the value of @xmath68 , and a reality condition for @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that there are physically interesting solutions with power - law inflation if @xmath37 is large enough and positive , and @xmath53 is positive .",
    "if instead @xmath62 the only solution is for @xmath87 and we get the consistency conditions@xmath59",
    "@xmath88    a challenging open problem is now the development of cosmological perturbation theory starting from lagrangians as in eq .",
    "this could tell us whether formation of structure in the early universe can also be accommodated within the framework of a wilson - type@xmath89 formulation of quantum gravity .",
