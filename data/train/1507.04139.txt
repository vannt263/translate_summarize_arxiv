    "the strong spin - orbit interaction is one of the current topics in condensed matter physics , as it accompanies fascinating phenomena such as the multipole order in @xmath14-electron systems@xcite and the @xmath15 mott transition in 5@xmath16 electron systems.@xcite in this context , the layered perovskite vanadium oxide sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 is attracting renewed interest as a candidate compound for a @xmath17 mott insulator showing novel spin - orbital magnetism .",
    "it has a tetragonal k@xmath0nif@xmath1 structure with the space group @xmath18 at room temperature.@xcite the magnetic vanadium ion ( v@xmath19 , 3@xmath17 ) is octahedrally coordinated with six ligand oxygen ions , where the octahedron is elongated along the @xmath8 axis .",
    "the anisotropy of the octahedron leads to a tetragonal crystal field that partially lifts the three - fold degeneracy of the @xmath20 orbitals by splitting them into @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals with @xmath21 having a higher energy .",
    "thus , the single @xmath16 electron would occupy the unquenched @xmath22 orbitals in case of a negligible spin - orbit interaction.@xcite    however , it has been pointed out that the spin - orbit coupling may be large enough to split the @xmath22 state into two kramers doublets.@xcite the kramers doublets are mapped to isospin up and down states , which consist of the electron spin and orbital angular momentum .",
    "it was also suggested that a magnetic octupole order ( an antiferroic order of the isospins ) would be the ground state of sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , an alternating scenario of a spin - orbital order with almost muted magnetic moments has been proposed for the ground state of this compound.@xcite    despite the efforts of several groups to synthesize high - quality powdered samples in search for signatures of novel spin - orbital magnetism , the varying electronic properties reported in earlier studies seem to call for precautions in assessing the results in relation to the sample quality .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath23 ) and heat capacity measurements provided a common ground that the compound successively undergoes three phase transitions at @xmath24  10 k , @xmath25  100 k , and @xmath3  130 k.@xcite a report on an in - house x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiment showed the splittings of several reflection peaks between @xmath7 and @xmath26.@xcite it was also reported that a rapid enhancement in the @xmath27 ratio ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the lengths of the unit cell along the respective crystalline axes ) occurred below @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    regarding the magnetic properties , a sudden decrease in @xmath23 was observed at @xmath7 , although the magnitude of the reduction varied from sample to sample.@xcite below @xmath13 , a clear hysteresis was observed in magnetization measurements , where the magnetism was confirmed to be a bulk property.@xcite the magnetic hysteresis implies the appearance of weak ferromagnetism below @xmath13 .",
    "although no experimental evidence for the magnetic octupole order has been reported so far , recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments suggest that the spin - orbit coupling is strong enough to induce excitation between the crystal field levels.@xcite further experimental investigation is required to clarify the microscopic details of magnetism in sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 .",
    "a previous study on muon spin rotation / relaxation ( @xmath2sr ) reported a spontaneous internal field at the muon site with a broad distribution and residual magnetic fluctuation in the temperature ( @xmath28 ) range of 1.8 k @xmath29.@xcite these results suggest that the spin - orbital ordering state , which was proposed by first - principles calculation studies by imai _ _ et al.__@xcite , appeared below @xmath13 .",
    "on the basis of the theoretical studies , we can expect a severe competition between many types of spin - orbital ordering patterns due to the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations and the associated effect of frustration .",
    "in such an exotic ground state , it is expected that the persistent spin dynamics and short - range correlations are found far below the magnetic ordering temperature .",

    "these structural properties below @xmath7 are fully consistent with the previous results reported by zhou _",

    "this seems reasonable because the crystal field splitting between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals is quite small ( @xmath310.08 ev in the local density approximation calculation).@xcite thus , we suggest that the @xmath21 orbital contribution to the electronic state is not negligible in the high-@xmath28 tetragonal phase above @xmath26 owing to the narrow gap between the @xmath22 and @xmath21 states . then , the electronic state changes to the pure @xmath22 state in the low-@xmath28 tetragonal phase below @xmath7 owing to an enhancement in the energy gap , which is caused by the increase in the @xmath27 ratio to gain crystal field energy .",
    "in the paramagnetic state of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems , the muon spin depolarization at zero external field has contributions from the static nuclear dipolar fields and the fluctuating fields from electron spins .",

    "generally , the exponential damping due to the electron spin fluctuation does not depend much on the lf because the fluctuation rate of the dynamical field from the ordinary paramagnetic moments is much larger than the larmor frequency of the muon spin precession .",
    "however , the depolarization is quenched by the application of a relatively weak lf , which indicates that @xmath60 is much weaker than the lf and that it is quasistatic within the time window of @xmath2sr ( @xmath68 s ) .",

    "this indicates that there are no severe deformation and crystallographic randomness due to the oxygen off - stoichiometry in sample - a . from these results",
    ", we can consider that the inhomogeneous magnetism might have an intrinsic origin , although we would observe a qualitative difference in the field distribution , correlation length , and relaxation rate depending on the magnitude of the oxygen off - stoichiometry .",
    "et al . _ also revealed that there is severe competition between many spin - orbital order patterns due to the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions and the associated effect of frustration in sr@xmath0vo@xmath1.@xcite in their proposed spin - orbital ordering patterns , orthogonal and not strictly orthogonal nearest - neighboring orbital configurations appeared .",
    "such orbital configurations induce the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interactions because of the goodenough - kanamori rule .",
    "we suggest that the observed broad @xmath60 distribution , short - range correlations , and persistent spin dynamics are signatures of the severe competition between the possible spin - orbital ordered patterns in sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 .",
    "we have conducted sr - xrd and @xmath2sr measurements of polycrystalline samples of sr@xmath0vo@xmath1 .",
    "the sr - xrd results suggest the existence of an intermediate orthorhombic phase between @xmath3  130 k and @xmath4  100 k , whereas a tetragonal phase appears for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "although a large enhancement in the @xmath27 ratio had been confirmed below @xmath7 , we could not find clear evidence for the superlattice modulation and the lowering of the lattice symmetry from tetragonal @xmath18 , which is easily expected for the orbital order state with a superlattice structure of @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals .",
    "these results indicate that the degeneracy of the @xmath22 orbitals is not lifted , even below @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath2sr data revealed that the structural transition at @xmath7 does not accompany magnetic ordering . on the other hand",
    ", we extended the @xmath2sr measurement down to 30 mk and found a highly inhomogeneous magnetic ordered state with slow persistent spin dynamics below @xmath12  10 k. in the magnetic ordered state , the @xmath2sr spectra were well fitted by the gbg function , which is known to describe the muon spin depolarization due to the inhomogeneous magnetism with short - range correlations and a vast moment size distribution .",
    "these results suggest that the inhomogeneous magnetic state may be a signature of the severe competition between the many possible spin - orbital ordered states predicted by first - principles calculations @xcite .",
