    "the x - ray surface brightness of many clusters of galaxies shows a strong central peak which has been interpreted as the signature of a cooling flow ( cowie & binney 1977 , fabian & nulsen 1977 , sarazin 1988 , fabian 1994 ) .",
    "however , the simple cooling flow model conflicts with a growing number of observations that show that while the temperature is declining in the central region , gas with a temperature below @xmath01 kev is significantly less abundant than predicted .",
    "the absence of a cool phase in cooling flows has proven a persistent puzzle .",
    "recently , two main candidates for the heating of the gas in the central regions of clusters have emerged : ( i ) heating by outflows from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( @xcite , churazov et al .",
    "2001a , @xcite , @xcite , brggen 2003 ) , and ( ii ) transport of heat from the outer regions of the cluster by thermal conduction ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the role of thermal conduction in the icm has been the subject of a long debate and , owing to the complex physics of mhd turbulence , the value of the effective conductivity remains uncertain .",
    "the thermal conductivity of an unmagnetised , fully ionised plasma was calculated by @xcite .",
    "originally it has been thought that the magnetic field in clusters strongly supresses the thermal conductivity because the magnetic fields prevent an efficient transport perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "even if the transport can be efficient along the magnetic field lines , the overall isotropic conductivity was thought to be many orders of magnitude less than the spitzer value .",
    "this paradigm has been supported by a number of observations , such as sharp edges at so - called cold fronts , small - scale temperature variations in mergers and sharp boundaries around radio bubbles .",
    "it is thought that the existence of these sharp features precludes thermal conduction near the spitzer value ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 , vikhlinin , markevitch & murray 2001 ) .",
    "recent theoretical work by @xcite , malyshkin & kulsrud ( 2001 ) , chandran et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , chandran & cowley ( 1998 ) and earlier work by rechester & rosenbluth ( 1978 ) has shown that a turbulent magnetic field is not as efficient in suppressing thermal conduction as previously thought .",
    "it is argued that chaotic transverse motions of the tangled magnetic field lines can enhance the cross - field diffusion to an extent that the effective conductivity is of the order of the spitzer value . following this work , @xcite",
    "have looked for hydrostatically stable models in which the radiative cooling is exactly balanced by thermal conduction and where the temperatures on the inner and outer boundaries were fixed . for half of the clusters they investigated they found that a thermal conductivity of around 30 % of the spitzer value yielded good fits to the observed profiles .",
    "however , for the other half of the clusters conduction alone appeared unlikely to halt a cooling catastrophe .",
    "consequently , some form of heating is necessary such as mechanical heating by agn .",
    "the work by @xcite has motivated us to reexamine cluster models that takes into account thermal conduction as well as heating by central radio sources .",
    "we include a more generally valid treatment of radiative cooling by utilising a fit to the cooling function that takes into account line cooling .",
    "this becomes particularly important in the central regions of cooler clusters .",
    "+ radio - loud agn drive strong outflows in the form of jets that inflate bubbles or lobes .",
    "the lobes are filled with hot plasma , and can heat the cluster gas in various ways .",
    "the effect of hot bubbles on the icm consists primarily of heating via @xmath1 work and redistribution of mass via buoyancy - driven mixing .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations ( brggen 2003 ) have shown that a significant fraction ( @xmath2 % ) of the energy residing in radio lobes can be dissipated in the cluster gas .    clearly , the lifetime of the activity of the central agn ( as brief as @xmath3 yrs ) is short compared to the evolutionary time scale of the cluster gas .",
    "therefore , once the agn stops supplying energy to the buoyant bubbles , the cluster gas will settle down once again and a full cooling flow may be re - established .",
    "the cooling gas flows to the centre of the cluster and may then trigger a further active phase of the agn .",
    "thus a self - regulating process with cooling periods alternating with brief bursts of agn activity may be established ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the rising bubbles uplift colder material from the vicinity of the agn and thus disrupt the supply of fresh fuel for the radio jets .",
    "this feedback mechanism might automatically regulate the power of the radio jets .",
    "it has been found that 71 % of all cd galaxies at the centres of cooling - flow clusters show evidence of radio activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fraction is higher than in non - cooling flow galaxies which again points towards the existence of some form of feedback mechanism where the cooling gas flows to the centre of the cluster and triggers a further active phase of the agn .",
    "the bubbles rise at a speed that is comparable to the sound speed , which in turn is comparable to the dynamical speed .",
    "therefore , the cooling timescale is much longer than the bubble rise timescale , and it is justifiable to treat feedback heating in a time - averaged sense .    in this paper , we will present a simple model that incorporates , both , thermal conduction and heating by bubbles .",
    "we compute a class of models that are subject to radiative cooling , thermal conduction , heating by agn and that are in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we will investigate those parameters that yield plausible solutions and will compare our solutions to observations .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the origin of the energy that is conducted into the cluster .",
    "in our model of the cluster , we assume that the dark matter distribution is given by a modified nfw profile ( @xcite )    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the distance from the centre , @xmath6 the scale radius of the nfw profile and @xmath7 a softening radius , within which the density becomes constant and which prevents the temperature from going to zero at @xmath8 .",
    "the core radius @xmath7 determines the shape of the potential near the centre and here we adopt @xmath9 as recommended by @xcite .",
    "we can express the characteristic mass @xmath10 in terms of the commonly used concentration parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the cluster and @xmath13 is the virial mass :    @xmath14    the conductive heat flux is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the thermal conductivity and @xmath17 temperature .",
    "if thermal conduction is due to electrons , the conductivity according to spitzer ( 1962 ) is given by    @xmath18    here we seek an equilibrium model that is spherically symmetric , static , and time - independent .",
    "moreover , we neglect magnetic fields and the self - gravity of the icm . in spherical coordinates ,",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath19 is governed by the dark matter distribution    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant .",
    "following @xcite the mass - temperature relation of @xcite and the mass - scale relation of @xcite , can be used to determine @xmath10 and @xmath6 for a given cluster .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium can now be written as    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is pressure and @xmath24 gas density . demanding that radiative cooling and heating",
    "are balanced by thermal conduction , we can write    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the volume cooling and heating functions , respectively , and @xmath28 is the conductive flux , which depends on the temperature gradient as stated above    @xmath29    where we write @xmath16 as @xmath30 , @xmath31 being a suppression factor . we should point out that we omitted a term for the convective flux in equation ( [ fr ] ) .",
    "however , for the levels of heating considered here the icm is convectively stable and the neglect of convection is a justifiable assumption .",
    "pressure is related to @xmath32 and @xmath17 via the ideal gas law    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the atomic mass unit .",
    "+ for the volume cooling rate @xmath26 we use an approximation to the cooling function based on calculations by @xcite    @xmath35\\frac{\\mu_e}{\\mu } n_e^2\\ 10^{-22}\\ ; { \\rm erg}\\ ; { \\rm cm}^{3}\\ ; { \\rm s}^{-1 } \\ .\\ ] ]    the units for @xmath36 are kev , @xmath32 is the electron number density , and @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the mean molecular weight per hydrogen atom and per electron , respectively . as in @xcite",
    "we use @xmath39 and @xmath40 , corresponding to a fully ionized gas with hydrogen fraction @xmath41 and helium fraction @xmath42 . for an average metallicity",
    "@xmath43 the constants are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "+ the term @xmath27 in equation ( [ fr ] ) represents the energy input by a central agn .",
    "the energy is deposited in the icm by the rising bubbles and thus , averaged over time , the heating will be distributed in radius . to quantify this heating",
    ", we use a prescription proposed by @xcite which quantifies the heating of the icm by the rising bubbles . assuming that this heating mechanism reaches a quasi - steady state , the details of the bubble motions and geometry should cancel and the energy flux may be written as    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the partial pressure of buoyant gas inside bubbles at radius @xmath5 and @xmath51 is the adiabatic index of buoyant gas which we will take to be 4/3 . assuming that the partial pressure scales with the thermal pressure of the icm , the volume heating function @xmath27 can be expressed as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the central pressure and @xmath54 is the normalization function    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the luminosity of the agn . the normalisation factor @xmath57",
    "is defined by    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the inner heating cutoff radius which is determined by the finite size of the central radio source . here",
    "@xmath59 was taken to be 10 kpc .",
    "this heating function mimics a possible feedback mechanism between the agn and the icm in the sense that the volume heating function does not depend on the physical conditions at the source alone but on the pressure gradient ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it resembles thermal conduction , with the difference that the heating rate depends on the gradient of pressure rather than temperature .",
    "+ equations ( [ phi ] ) - ( [ eos ] ) can be combined to yield a set of four first - order differential equations for @xmath32 , @xmath60 , @xmath17 and @xmath61 .",
    "we solve these equations as an initial - value problem subject to the initial conditions : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are parameters .",
    "other parameters in this simplified model are @xmath10 , @xmath6 , @xmath31 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have investigated the dependence of the resulting density and temperature profiles on some of these parameters , which is discussed in the next session .",
    "we integrate the system of four ordinary differential equations using a runge - kutta method and adopt a characteristic mass of @xmath68 and a scale radius of @xmath69 kpc ( parameters inferred for the cluster abell 1795 , @xcite ) . for a cluster with a central temperature of 2 kev and a central density of @xmath70 @xmath71 the resulting density and temperature profiles are shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "curves plotted in different styles correspond to different values of the suppression factor @xmath31 and the luminosity of the central source @xmath56 .",
    "the values assumed for @xmath56 here correspond to typical energies supplied by the jet to the icm of @xmath72 erg s@xmath73 ( e.g. owen , eilek and kassim 2000 ) . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "one can note that the temperature profile rises less steeply with radius if thermal conduction is more efficient . in order to maintain a given central temperature ,",
    "the temperatures gradient in the cluster has to be higher if conduction is more suppressed .",
    "the higher temperature gradient makes up for the smaller suppression factor so that enough energy is conducted inwards to balance the radiative losses .",
    "the highest value for the suppression factor that we have adopted here ( 0.5 ) is at the upper end of what is physically plausible .",
    "even higher thermal conductivities seem very unlikely .",
    "moreover , one can see , that the heating term has an effect similar to that of thermal conduction , in that a higher luminosity of the central source flattens out the temperature profile . because the distributed heating depends on the pressure gradient",
    ", a higher luminosity of the central source can afford a smaller pressure gradient , leading to a shallower temperature distribution .",
    "physically speaking , the smaller pressure gradient makes the energy transfer from the bubbles to the icm less efficient .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are the corresponding figures for a cluster with a higher central temperature of 4 kev , all other parameters being the same . for this hotter cluster",
    "the luminosity of the central source has to be higher in order to produce the same relative effect as in the cooler cluster . in these plots",
    "we also included a model with a high luminosity of @xmath75  erg s@xmath73 . in this case",
    "the temperature distribution is nearly isothermal .",
    "clearly , by including a physically motivated heating term , there are more degrees of freedom to fit the density and temperature profiles inferred from observations .",
    "this can be demonstrated at the example of hydra a which is a well - studied cooling flow cluster with a fr i radio source ( 3c218 ) at its centre .",
    "@xcite have shown that hydra a can not be fitted with a conduction model alone unless one allows for unplausibly high values for @xmath16 .",
    "the nfw parameters for hydra a are @xmath76 kpc and @xmath77 .",
    "the central electron density is @xmath78 @xmath71 , the temperature at the centre is @xmath79  kev and at 190 kpc is @xmath80  kev . in figure [ fig5 ]",
    "we show the temperature profile as inferred from chandra observations ( @xcite ) together with our best fit for @xmath81 ( @xmath82 erg s@xmath73 ) .",
    "as is readily seen , the inclusion of the heating term produces a good fit to the data without having to invoke an abnormally high conductivity .",
    "a question that we have not addressed so far is the question of the origin of the energy that is conducted inwards in order to keep the cluster from collapsing . if we take a cluster model with no heating , i.e. @xmath83 , and a suppression factor of @xmath84 ( all other parameters being those of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the asymptotic value of @xmath85 at large radii is @xmath86 erg s@xmath73 .",
    "this means that over a period of 5 gyrs a total energy of @xmath87 erg has to be conducted into the cluster which amounts to @xmath88 % of the total thermal energy of the cluster ( @xmath89 ) . for higher values of @xmath31",
    "this percentage increases .",
    "ultimately , this energy must be provided by infalling gas at the accretion shock .",
    "it was pointed out by @xcite that a significant thermal conductivity will also lead to energy transport out of the cluster because beyond the temperature maximum of the cluster the temperature begins to drop again and the temperature gradient is reversed . therefore , conduction is also reversed and heat is transported from the cluster to its surrounding envelope in these regions . as estimated by @xcite ,",
    "heat conduction must be suppressed significantly over the spitzer value in the outer cluster regions or else the cores of x - ray clusters would have cooled significantly over their life times .      we have not performed a stability analysis of the model presented here .",
    "instead we refer the reader to relevant works that have been published by others .",
    "the thermal stability of stratified atmospheres in the presence of radiative cooling and heat conduction was first analysed by field ( 1965 ) and later generalised by balbus ( 1988 ) and balbus and soker ( 1989 ) who performed a lagrangian stability analysis .",
    "recently , the issue of thermal instability in clusters was revisited by @xcite who examined the global stability of the models found by @xcite .",
    "on the basis of a lagrangian perturbation analysis they concluded that the growth time of the most unstable global radial mode was @xmath0 6 - 9 times longer than the growth time of the local isobaric modes at the centre if the conductivity was 20 % to 40 % of the spitzer value .",
    "typical growth times are thus comparable with the time since the last cluster merger . hence it is argued that the cluster is thermally stable if there is a sufficient amount of thermal conduction .",
    "the presence of a heating term as implemented in our model will act to increase the stability of the cluster .",
    "we have devised a one - dimensional hydrostatic model for the icm where radiative losses are balanced by , both , thermal conduction and heating by a central source . by including a physically motivated heating term we have shown that it is possible to fit cluster profiles without having to invoke unplausibly high values for the thermal conductivity .",
    "we should concede , however , that our model is very simplified : it assumes that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and spherically symmetric , it does not allow the gas to condense and drop out of the flow , it ignores magnetic fields and includes a heuristic treatment of heating by agn . but despite its simplicity , only a few free parameters suffice to reproduce the observed profiles of x - ray clusters .",
