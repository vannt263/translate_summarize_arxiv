    "this effect , known as the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , is a source of secondary anisotropies in the temperature of the cmb ( see refs . for reviews ) . because the sz effect is proportional to the integrated pressure of the gas",

    "moreover , it must be carefully subtracted from the primary cmb anisotropies , to allow the high - precision determination of cosmological parameters with the new generation of cmb experiments ( see and references therein ) .",
    "thanks to impressive recent observational progress , the sz effect from clusters of galaxies is now well established @xcite .",
    "the statistics of sz clusters were calculated by a number of authors using the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( eg . ) .",
    "recently , atrio - barandera & mcket used this formalism , along with assumptions about cluster profiles to compute the angular power spectrum of the sz anisotropies for the einstein  de sitter universe .",

    "this mass range is used for calculating the angular power spectrum , the mean comptonization parameter , and the density - weighted temperature .",
    "a more detailed inspection of figure  [ fig : pk_rhodm ] reveals that the resolution of the simulations depends on redshift , and involves a power law cutoff in @xmath109 rather than a sharp cutoff .",

    "figure  [ fig : trho ] shows a map of the density - weighted temperature for the @xmath82cdm model projected through one box at @xmath119 . clusters of galaxies are clearly apparent as regions with @xmath120 kev .",
    "the gas in filaments and groups can be seen to stretch between clusters and has temperatures in the range @xmath121 kev .",
    "while these regions have smaller temperatures , they have a relatively large covering factor and can thus contribute considerably to the @xmath0-parameter and to the sz fluctuations .",

    "in such a map , the filamentary structure is less apparent as filaments are averaged out by projection @xcite .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the contribution of groups and filaments to the sz effect is presented in the following sections .",
    "the evolution of the density - weighted temperature for each of the simulations is shown on figure  [ fig : t_z ] .",
    "the temperatures at present are listed in table  [ tab : results ] and are quite similar .",
    "this is expected since all models were chosen to have similar @xmath81 normalizations .",
    "the evolution is steeper for the scdm , flatter for the ocdm model , and intermediate for the @xmath82cdm model .",
    "this is consistent with the different rate of growth of structure for each model .",
    "also plotted on this figure is the density - weighted temperature derived from the ps formalism ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : pstrho ] ] ) .",
    "the agreement for @xmath124 is good , both for the relative amplitudes and for the shapes of the temperature evolution . at @xmath125",
    "the non - linear mass scale is not sufficiently large compared to the mass resolution of the simulation , so the temperatures are not meaningful in that regime .",
    "this is however not a serious limitation , as these redshifts do not contribute significantly to either the mean comptonization or the sz fluctuations .",
    "the ps temperatures exceed the simulations at low redshift for all cosmological models , since massive ( high temperature ) clusters , which may be missed in the simulations due to the effect of finite box size , dominate there .",
    "the ps temperatures at @xmath119 are listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the parameters of our @xmath82cdm model were chosen to coincide with that for the simulation of cen & ostriker@xcite .",
    "while the slope of our density - weighted temperature agrees approximately with theirs for @xmath126 , the amplitude is significantly different .",
    "they find a final temperature of about 0.9 kev , which is a factor of about 5 larger than ours .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to the fact that their simulation include feedback from star formation , while ours only comprise gravitational forces .",
    "it is however surprising that standard feedback could produce such a large difference .",
    "one can estimate the gravitational binding energy of virialized matter from the cosmic energy equation @xcite and finds a thermal component of fluids to be of order 1/4 kev , consistent with our simulations .",
    "we should note , however , that the high thermal temperatures from feedback may be required for consistency with the x - ray background constraints@xcite .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is still unknown at present , but should be kept in mind for the interpretation of our results .",
    "the mean comptonization parameter for each simulation was derived using equation  ( [ eq : y_bar ] ) and is listed in table  [ tab : results ] . in all cases , @xmath54 is well below the upper limit @xmath60 ( 95% cl ) set by the cobe / firas instrument @xcite .",
    "the differential and cumulative redshift dependence of @xmath54 are shown on figure  [ fig : y_z ] .",
    "for the three models , most of the mean sz effect is produced at @xmath127 .",
    "the contribution from high redshift is largest for the ocdm and smallest for the scdm model , again in agreement with the relative growth of fluctuations in each model .",
    "the differential and cumulative redshift dependence of @xmath54 derived from the ps formalism are shown on this figure as the thin lines .",
    "the values of @xmath54 from ps are also listed in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "they are higher than that for the simulations by about 25% for the @xmath82cdm and ocdm models , are in close agreement for the scdm model .",
    "the shapes of the differential curves approximately agree , although the ps formalism predicts more contributions from lower redshifts .",
    "this is can be traced to the slightly steeper evolution of the ps temperatures in figure  [ fig : t_z ] , and is due to massive nearby clusters .      as noted in ",
    "[ sz ] , the sz power spectrum can be derived from the history of the temperature @xmath56 and of the pressure power spectrum @xmath128 ( eq .  [ [ eq : cl ] ] ) .",

    "the amplitude of @xmath128 increases with redshift , while keeping an approximately similar shape .",
    "perhaps more instructive is the evolution of the pressure bias @xmath129 ( eq  [ [ eq : bp ] ] ) , which is shown on figure  [ fig : bp ] . for @xmath130",
    ", @xmath114 is approximately independent of scale , in the @xmath109-range of confidence ( @xmath131 mpc@xmath35 ; see figure  [ fig : pk_rhodm ] ) .",

    ", @xmath114 remains approximately constant on large scales , but is larger on small scales .",
    "indeed , at early times , only a small number of small regions have collapsed and are thus sufficiently hot to contribute to the pressure . as a result , the pressure at high-@xmath101 is more strongly biased on small scales .",
    "the sz angular power spectrum derived from integrating the pressure power spectrum along the line of sight ( eq .  [ [ eq : cl ] ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : cl ] for each simulation . for comparison ,",
    "the spectrum of primary cmb anisotropies was computed using cmbfast@xcite , and was also plotted on this figure as the solid line .",
    "the sz power spectrum can be seen to be two order of magnitude below the primordial power spectrum below @xmath134 , but comparable to it beyond that .",
    "because of finite resolution and box size , the sz power spectra should be interpreted as lower limits outside of the @xmath41-range of confidence highlighted by thicker lines ( see  [ limitations ] ) . the scdm spectrum is lower than that for the @xmath82cdm and ocdm .",
    "this is a consequence of the lower value of @xmath81 for this model .",
    "indeed , kk99 have shown that the sz power spectrum scales as @xmath135 , and is thus very sensitive on this normalization .",
    "this scaling relation also allows us to compare our results to that of the scdm calculation of persi et al.@xcite .",
    "the amplitude of their power spectrum , rescaled to the same value of @xmath81 , is within 20% of ours at @xmath136 , while its shape is similar to ours .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl_methods ] presents a comparison of the sz power spectra derived from each of the three methods described in  [ methods ] . for both the simulations and the ps formalism , the sz power spectra peak around @xmath137 for the scdm and @xmath82cdm models , and around @xmath138 for the ocdm model . on the other hand , the constant bias models , which do not have a mass or @xmath109 cutoff , peak at @xmath139",
    "this is explained by the fact that this model does not have a mass or @xmath109 cutoff and has therefore more power on small scales . in  [ limitations ]",
    ", we will use this comparison to study the effect of finite resolution and box size of the simulations .    for @xmath1 , the simulation and ps predictions approximately agree for the scdm and @xmath82cdm models .",
    "on the other hand , for the ocdm model , the ps prediction is a factor of 3 higher than that from the simulations in this range .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that the @xmath82cdm simulation yields a larger pressure bias @xmath114 ( eq .  [ eq : bp ] ) at low redshifts than the ocdm simulation . by inspecting the figure corresponding to figure  [ fig : pk_rhodm ] for the ocdm model",
    ", we indeed noticed that more power was missing on small scales in this simulation .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the ocdm simulation was started at a higher redshift ( @xmath140 ) than the other two simulations ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "due to truncation errors in the laplacian and gradient calculations , modes with frequencies close to the nyquist frequency are known to grow much more slowly even in the linear regime .",
    "this effect is reduced if the simulation is started later .",
    "the redshift dependence of the sz power spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig : cl_z ] , for the @xmath82cdm model .",
    "most of the sz fluctuations are produced at low redshifts : at @xmath5 , about 50% of the power spectrum is produced at @xmath142 , and about 90% at @xmath143 .",
    "the contribution of the warm gas in groups and filaments can be studied by examining figure  [ fig : cl_t ] .",
    "this figure shows the @xmath82cdm power spectrum measured after removing hot regions from the simulation volume , for several cutoff temperatures .",
    "approximately 50% of the sz power spectrum at @xmath5 is produced by gas with @xmath144 . in  [ prospects ] , we show that these combined facts give good prospects for the removal ( and the detection ) of sz fluctuations from cmb maps .",
    "the behavior of the power spectrum for @xmath145 , in figures  [ fig : cl_t ] and [ fig : cl_z ] , agrees with the results of kk99 who studied the poisson and clustering contributions separately . at low @xmath41 s",
    ", the sz power spectrum is produced primarily by bright ( low - redshift or high - temperature ) objects , i.e. , by massive clusters , and is thus dominated by the poisson term .",
    "however , after subtracting bright clusters from the sz map , the correlation term dominates the poisson term at high redshift . therefore , the sz spectrum on large angular , measured after subtracting bright spots , should trace clustering at high redshift .",
    "this interesting effect will be discussed in details elsewhere .",
    "it is important to assess the effect of the limitations of the simulations on these results .",
    "first , the finite resolution may lower the temperature @xmath146 , since it prevents small scale structures from collapsing . as we saw in ",
    "[ ps ] , the resolution limits of the simulations correspond to halo masses of about @xmath147 . according to the ps formalism , the contribution to @xmath146 from halos with masses smaller than this limit is about @xmath148 kev , for @xmath124 in the @xmath82cdm model .",
    "the sz power spectrum at @xmath134 is produced mainly at low redshifts , and is therefore little affected by this effect .",
    "note however , that @xmath54 , which is sensitive to small halos at high redshifts , is more affected .",
    "indeed , the contribution to @xmath54 by these halos is about @xmath149 , assuming a gas mass fraction of @xmath96 .",
    "the finite box size and resolution also suppress power in the pressure power spectrum . as we saw in  [ resolution ] and figure  [ fig : pk_rhodm ] , the simulations lack power for @xmath150 and @xmath151 mpc@xmath35 . to test the impact of this suppression , we consider the constant bias model described in  [ bias_model ] . the total sz power spectrum for this model",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : cl_kran ] as the solid line , for the @xmath82cdm case .",
    "this figure also shows the results of performing the same calculation , but after suppressing power in several ranges of @xmath109 values . the finite box size ( keeping only modes with @xmath152 mpc@xmath35 ) reduces @xmath153 slightly for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and thus does not have a very large effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the finite resolution ( @xmath156 mpc@xmath35 ) reduces @xmath153 considerably for @xmath157 .",
    "the above results can be interpreted as follows . at a given @xmath41",
    ", the limited @xmath109-range corresponds to a limited @xmath101-range , @xmath158 .",

    "come from @xmath167 , the finite @xmath168 decreases @xmath166 only at low @xmath41 , while @xmath169 does so over the entire @xmath41 range .",
    "we conclude that the limitations of the simulations precludes us from predicting the sz power spectrum outside of the @xmath170 range .",
    "these limits can only be improved by using larger simulations .",
    "it is however worth noting that there could be more sz power around @xmath171 .",
    "this might then be detectable by future interferometric cmb measurements that have angular resolutions around @xmath172 , intermediate in scale between the satellite missions and the planned millimeter experiments ( alma , lmsa ) .",
    "the impact of secondary anisotropies on the upcoming map mission @xcite were studied by refregier et al.@xcite .",
    "they showed that discrete sources , gravitational lensing and the sz effect were the dominant extragalactic foregrounds for map .",
    "the dotted line on figure  [ fig : cl ] shows the expected noise for measuring the primary cmb power spectrum with the 94 ghz map channel , with a band average of @xmath173 . for all model considered ,",
    "the sz power spectrum is well below the noise .",
    "the @xmath174 @xmath0-parameter for the map 94 ghz beam ( @xmath175 fwhm ) is listed in table  [ tab : results ] for each model , from both the simulations and the ps formalism .",
    "the resulting rms rj temperature fluctuations are of the order of a few @xmath176k , compared to a nominal antenna noise of about @xmath177k .",
    "the sz effect will therefore not be a major limitation for estimating cosmological parameters with map .    for comparison ,",
    "the residual spectrum from undetected point sources ( @xmath178 jy ) expected using the model of toffolatti et al.@xcite is shown in figure  [ fig : cl ] for the 94 ghz channel .",
    "point sources dominate over the sz effect at @xmath179 , but are comparable below that .",
    "moreover , we have shown in figure  [ fig : cl_z ] and [ fig : cl_t ] , that about 50% of the sz power spectrum at @xmath180 is produced at low redshifts ( @xmath142 ) and by clusters of galaxies ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "this confirms the results of refregier et al . , who predicted that most of the sz effect could be removed by cross - correlating the cmb maps with existing x - ray cluster catalogs ( eg .",
    "xbacs @xcite , bcs @xcite ) .",
    "because of its limited spectral coverage , the map mission will not permit a separation between the sz effect and primordial anisotropies .",
    "apart from a handful of clusters which will appear as point sources , it will therefore be difficult to detect the sz fluctuations directly with map .",
    "on the other hand , the future planck surveyor mission @xcite will cover both the positive and the negative side of the sz frequency spectrum , and will thus allow a clear separation of the different foreground and background components @xcite .",
    "aghanim et al .",
    "@xcite have established that , using such a separation , the sz profiles of individual clusters can be measured down to @xmath182 . moreover , hobson et al .",
    "@xcite have estimated that the sz power spectrum could be measured for @xmath183 , with a precision per multipole of about 70% .",
    "planck surveyor will therefore provide a precise measurement of the total sz power spectrum .",
    "this would provide a direct , independent measurement of @xmath50 and of @xmath81@xcite , and would thus help breaking the degeneracies in the cosmological parameters estimated from primordial anisotropies alone . note that this measurement might be also feasible , albeit with less precision , with upcoming balloon experiments which also have broad spectral coverage .",
    "[ planck ]      the measured abundance of deuterium in low metallicity systems , together with big bang nucleosynthesis , predicts about twice as many baryons than what is observed in galaxies , stars , clusters and neutral gas @xcite .",
    "these `` missing baryons '' are likely to be in the form of the warm gas in groups in filaments @xcite .",
    "this component is indeed difficult to observe directly since it is too cold to be seen in the x - ray band , and too hot to produce any absorption lines in the quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "the sz effect on large scale could however provides a unique probe of this warm gas .",
    "one can indeed imagine subtracting the detected clusters from sz maps , and measuring the power spectrum of the residual sz fluctuations , which are mainly produced by groups and filaments .",
    "for instance , if all clusters with @xmath184 kev were removed from the sz map , the sz power spectrum would drop by a factor of about 2 for @xmath134 ( see figure  [ fig : cl_t ] ) . for the planck surveyor sensitivity quoted in  [ planck ] , this yields a signal - to - noise ration per multipole of about 1 . the amplitude ,",
    "if not the shape , of the residual sz spectrum will thus be easily detected by planck , thus yielding constraints on the temperature and density of the missing baryons .    in our simulations , we have only included gravitational forces .",
    "however , feedback from star and agn formation can also significantly heat the igm and thus affect the observed sz effect .",
    "valegeas & silk @xcite ( see also reference therein ) , have studied the energy injection produced by photo - ionization , supernovae , and agn . in their model ,",
    "agn are the most efficient , and can heat the igm by as much as @xmath185 k by a redshift of a few .",
    "this results in a mean @xmath0-parameter of about @xmath2 , which is comparable to our value derived from gravitational instability alone .",
    "preheating by feedback can thus increase the amplitude of the sz effect by a factor of a few , and thus be easily detected by planck .",
    "feedback can thus be directly measured as an excess in the @xmath0-parameter or in the sz power spectrum , over the prediction from gravitational instability alone .",
    "energy injection has a large effect on the gas in groups and filaments , comparatively to that in clusters .",
    "we may thus also detect the effects of feedback through the relationship between the x - ray temperature of groups ( or their galaxy velocity dispersion ) and their sz temperature .",
    "these measurements would then constrain the physics of energy injection .",
    "we have studied the sz effect using mmh simulations .",
    "our results for the mean comptonization parameter is consistent with earlier work using the press - schechter formalism and hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "it is found to be lower than the current observational limit by about one order of magnitude , for all considered cosmologies .",
    "the sz power spectrum is found to be comparable to the primary cmb power spectrum at @xmath186 . for the scdm model , our sz power spectrum is approximately consistent with that derived by persi et al.@xcite , after rescaling for the differing values of @xmath81 .",
    "we found that groups and filaments ( @xmath187 ) contribute about 50% of the sz power spectrum at @xmath5 . on these scales , about 50% of the sz power spectrum is produced at @xmath6 and can thus be removed using x - ray cluster catalogs .",
    "the sz fluctuations are well below the instrumental noise expected for the upcoming map mission , and should therefore not be a limiting factor .",
    "the sz power spectrum should however be accurately measured by the future planck mission .",
    "such a measurement will yield an independent measurement of @xmath50 and @xmath81 , and thus complement the measurements of primary anisotropies@xcite .",
    "we have compared our simulation results with predictions from the ps formalism .",
    "the results from the two methods agree approximately , but differ in the details .",
    "the discrepancy could be due to the finite resolution of the simulations , which limit the validity of our predictions outside the @xmath1 range .",
    "we also find discrepancies with other numerical simulations .",
    "these issues can only be settled with larger simulations , and by a detailed comparison of different hydrodynamical codes .",
    "such an effort is required for our theoretical predictions to match the precision with which the sz power spectrum will be measured in the future .",
    "a promising approach to measure the sz effect on large scales is to cross - correlate cmb maps with galaxy catalogs @xcite .",
    "most of the sz fluctuations on map s angular scales ( @xmath188 ) are produced at low redshifts and are thus correlated with tracers of the local large scale structure .",
    "preliminary estimates indicate that such a cross - correlation between map and the existing apm galaxy catalog would yield a significant detection .",
    "of course , even larger signals are expected for the planck surveyor mission .",
    "this would again provide a probe of the gas distributed not only in clusters , but also in the surrounding large - scale structure and therefore help solve the missing baryon problem .",
    "moreover , energy injection from star and agn formation can produce an sz amplitude in excess of our predictions , which only involve gravitational forces .",
    "the measurement of sz fluctuations or of a cross - correlation signal thus provides a measure of feedback and can thus shed light on the process of galaxy formation .",
