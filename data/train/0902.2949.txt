    "normal unevolved early ob - type stars of @xmath08 - 20 m@xmath1 are the objects with the simplest photospheric physics among the massive stars .",
    "they are unaffected by e.g. strong stellar winds like the hotter and more luminous stars or by convection and chromospheres like the cool supergiants . however , their spectral analysis turned out to provide inconclusive results in the past decades , i.e. too large uncertainties in basic stellar parameters and an overall enormous range in derived elemental abundances , posing a challenge to predictions of stellar and galactochemical evolution models ( see review by przybilla  2008 ) .    in order to improve the quantitative analysis of these stars",
    "we have exhaustively updated the spectral modelling by constructructing robust model atoms for non - lte line - formation calculations . in parallel , we have implemented a powerful self - consistent analysis technique , which brings numerous spectroscopic parameter and abundance indicators into agreement simultaneously .",
    "our efforts have provided highly - promising results so far , i.e. a drastic reduction of statistical and systematic uncertainties in stellar parameters and chemical abundances ( nieva & przybilla  2007 , 2008 ; np07/08 ) . as a first application",
    ", stars from ob associations and the field in the solar neighbourhood covering a broad parameter range were analysed .",
    "the sample turned out to be chemically homogeneous on the @xmath010% level ( przybilla , nieva & butler 2008 , pnb08 ) , corroborating earlier findings from analyses of the ism gas - phase .",
    "the data are also consistent with published orion nebula abundances .",
    "the results have an immediate impact on several fields of contemporary astrophysics like stellar ( see przybilla , firnstein & nieva , these proceedings ) and galactic chemical evolution models and the dust - phase composition of the local ism .",
    "they provide an independent view on the discussion of photospheric solar abundances and helioseismic constraints on the solar interior model , and they define the initial chemical composition for models of star and planet formation in the solar neighbourhood . in addition",
    ", a few b - type hyper - velocity stars were analysed using this technique , providing valuable constraints on their nature and their ejection mechanisms ( przybilla et al .  2008a , b ) .",
    "despite this kind of star has relatively simple photospheres compared to other objects , the spectral analysis is still sensitive to many potential systematic effects which are usually underestimated .",
    "we discuss the most common sources of systematic error that have to be avoided when high precision / accuracy in spectral analyses is desired .",
    "observational constraints as obtained from automatic spectral analyses of large star samples like the vlt - flames survey of massive stars may benefit significantly from a proper elimination of these systematics .",
    "a hybrid approach is used for the non - lte line - formation computations .",
    "these are based on line - blanketed plane - parallel , homogeneous and hydrostatic lte model atmospheres calculated with atlas9 .",
    "non - lte synthetic spectra are computed with recent versions of detail and surface .",
    "these codes solve the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations and compute synthetic spectra using refined line - broadening data , respectively .",
    "the hybrid non - lte approach is consistent with full non - lte calculations ( np07 ) but faster and it also allows comprehensive model atoms based on critically selected atomic data to be employed in the non - lte line - formation computations .",
    "the new spectral analysis was originally based on a self - consistent and simultaneous reproduction of almost all hydrogen , helium and carbon lines in the optical / near - ir spectra , matching multiple ionization equilibria ( hei / ii , cii / iii / iv ) , see nieva & przybilla  ( 2006 ) , np07 and np08 for details .",
    "the method was further extended by consideration of additional ionization equilibria ( oi / ii , nei / ii , siii / iii / iv , feii / iii , pnb08 ) .",
    "this allows unprecedently accurate stellar parameters and elemental abundances to be derived , with uncertainties as low as @xmath01% in effective temperature @xmath2 , @xmath010% in surface gravity @xmath3 and @xmath020% in elemental abundances .",
    "significant improvements on results from previous studies are thus achieved , which typically give uncertainties of @xmath05 - 10% , @xmath025% and a factor @xmath02 - 3 for these quantities .",
    "moreover , the successful implementation of the new method required an identification of sources of systematic uncertainties in standard spectral analyses and allowed in most cases for their quantification , which we discuss in the following .",
    "every step in a quantitative spectral analysis is susceptible to systematic uncertainties . here",
    "we briefly list the most common sources of systematics that affect the final error in stellar parameters and elemental abundances of normal unevolved early b - type stars . when possible , recipies are given how to prevent them .",
    "additional systematics may arise from further complications like magnetic fields , but this is beyond the present scope . + * single or double ?",
    "* not only spectroscopic but also close visual binaries are expected to be observed in dense fields .",
    "standard analyses for single stars applied to a spectrum contaminated with light of a second star can give erroneous results throughout .",
    "inspection of h or he lines can help to identify asymmetries due to a companion before carring out an automatised quantitative analysis .",
    "+ * quality of spectra .",
    "* continuum normalization , local continuum definition and low s / n are important sources of systematics .",
    "e.g. , spectra of s / n@xmath050 challenge the definition of the local continuum of spectral lines .",
    "the abundance determination in stars rotating at intermediate velocities ( @xmath4 ) is limited to 0.2 - 0.3dex in accuracy at this s / n .",
    "fast - rotating stars ( @xmath5 ) or low - resolution spectra impose even more complications because metal line blends lower the real continuum , hence the abundances can be systematically underestimated and the accuracy is limited to 0.3 - 0.4dex ( see korn et al .",

    "* model atoms . *",
    "most model atoms for non - lte calculations are based on input atomic data ( _ ab - initio _ and approximation data ) as available in the early nineties .",

    "spectroscopic determinations via ionization equilibria are a powerful technique only when the model atoms are reliable .",
    "in addition , _ one _ ionization equilibrium alone does not provide accurate constraints because of dependencies on other variables like microturbulence ( see below , fig .",
    "[ si - ie ] and consequences for c abundances in table  [ param_abund ] ) .",
    "therefore , only the simultaneous use of multiple ionization equilibria provides a reliable and parameter - free @xmath6 determination . + * surface gravity . * the common use of _ only one _ balmer line as @xmath7 indicator does not allow for consistency checks . instead , most balmer lines and metal ionization equilibria should be considered for an accurate determination . moreover , neglecting non - lte effects also leads to systematic errors : increasing with @xmath6 up to @xmath00.2dex in @xmath7 around 35000k , see np07/08 and sect .",

    "however , the microturbulent velocity @xmath9 should adopt the same value for all metals .",
    "in particular , cross - checks including different species are mandatory when only a few lines are measurable ( like in fast rotators ) in order to avoid large uncertainties .",
    "microturbulent velocities often come close to or exceed the sound speed in many previous studies .",
    "in contrast , physically more reasonable lower values are found in our work , increasing from @xmath02 - 4@xmath10 in dwarfs to @xmath05 - 8@xmath10 in giants .",
    "consequences of overestimated @xmath9 for the @xmath6 and abundance determination are discussed in sect .",
    "[ systematics ] + * spectral line selection .",
    "* abundances may depend on the selection of lines used in the analysis when the model atoms are not comprehensive : some multiplets may indicate systematically different abundances than others .",
    "moreover , some lines are observable only in cooler or in hotter stars .",
    "which lines should one choose for the analysis ?",
    "all possible observed lines for each star should be taken into account in the optimum case ( see np08 and pnb08 ) . +",
    "* non - lte corrections . *",
    "non - lte effects can not be easily predicted .",
    "they affect different lines of the same star in different ways .",
    "non - lte line strengthening or weakening can occur , and non - lte effects are not restricted to stronger lines alone . for different plasma conditions the non - lte effects change . hence , adding or subtracting fixed ` non - lte abundance corrections ' to lte results may increase the systematics .",
    "+ * macroturbulence .",
    "* macroturbulence is not considered in many studies .",
    "this is important for proper @xmath11 determinations in apparently slow - rotating objects .",
