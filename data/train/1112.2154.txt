    "a fundamental characteristic of the modern cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) cosmology @xcite is that galaxies assemble hierarchically under the influence of gravity , continually accreting smaller dm halos up until the present day .",
    "if those halos contain stars , then they will be visible as satellites around their host galaxies , eventually disrupting through tidal forces into distinct streams and shells before phase - mixing into obscurity @xcite .",
    "this picture seems to explain the existence of satellites and substructures observed around massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , quantitative confirmation of this aspect of @xmath1cdm has been more elusive , with lingering doubts provoked by small - scale substructure observations @xcite .",
    "there has been relatively little work on substructure and merging in the halos around low - mass , `` dwarf '' galaxies .",
    "many cases of extended stellar halos around dwarfs have been identified observationally @xcite , but it is not clear if these stars were accreted , or formed in - situ .",
    "star formation in dwarfs is thought to occur in stochastic episodes , which could be triggered by accretion events .",
    "an iconic galaxy in this context is ngc  4449 , a dwarf irregular in the field that has been studied intensively as one of the strongest galaxy - wide starbursts in the nearby universe .",
    "its absolute magnitude of @xmath2 makes it an lmc - analogue ( and not formally a dwarf by some definitions ) , but with a much higher star formation rate .",
    "it is strongly suspected to have recently interacted with another galaxy based on various signatures including peculiar kinematics in its cold gas and hii regions @xcite , but the nature of this interaction is unknown .",
    "an elongated dwarf galaxy or stream candidate near ngc  4449 was first noticed by @xcite from digitized sky survey ( poss - ii ) plates ( object d1228 + 4358 ) , and is visible in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "here we present deep , wide - field optical imaging that supplies the definitive detection of this ongoing accretion event involving a smaller galaxy , leading to interesting implications about the evolution of this system and of dwarf galaxies in general .",
    "our observations of ngc  4449 and its surroundings consist of two main components .",
    "the first is imaging from a small robotic telescope , to confirm the presence of a low - surface - brightness substructure and provide its basic characteristics ( similar techniques were used with larger galaxies in @xcite ) .",
    "the second is follow - up imaging with the subaru telescope to map out the resolved stellar populations .",
    "we obtained very deep images with the f/8.3 ritchey - chretien 0.5-meter telescope of the black bird remote observatory ( bbro ) during different dark - sky observing runs over the periods 2010 - 04 - 13 through 2010 - 06 - 10 , and 2011 - 01 - 13 through 2011 - 01 - 28 ( ut ) .",
    "we used a 16 mega - pixel apogee imaging systems u16 m ccd camera , with @xmath3 field - of - view and 0.46 arcsec  pix@xmath4 plate - scale .",
    "we acquired 18  hours of imaging data in half - hour sub - exposures , using a non - infrared clear luminance ( @xmath5  35008500 ) astrodon e - series filter .",
    "each sub - exposure was reduced following standard procedures for dark - subtraction , bias - correction , and flat - fielding @xcite .",
    "the resulting image was calibrated photometrically to sdss using the brighter regions of ngc  4449 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the final image has 5-@xmath6 @xmath7-band surface - brightness detection limits from 26.4 to 27.5 mag  arcsec@xmath8 for seeing - limited and large - scale diffuse features , respectively .",
    "we subsequently obtained images from the 8.2-m subaru telescope and the suprime - cam wide - field imager ( 34@xmath927@xmath10 field - of - view , @xmath11 pixel - scale ; @xcite ) on 2011 - 01 - 05 ( ut ) .",
    "conditions were photometric , and we took dithered exposures in @xmath12 and @xmath13 bands , with total exposure times of 225 s per filter .",
    "we reduced the data using a modified sdfred pipeline @xcite , including bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and distortion correction .",
    "each frame was re - projected to a common astrometric coordinate system followed by background rectification and image co - addition using montage .",
    "the exquisite image quality ( @xmath14 fwhm ) allows us to resolve individual stars in the outer regions of ngc  4449 .",
    "we carried out point - spread - function photometry using daophot  ii / allstars @xcite , and identified stars as objects with sharpness parameter @xmath15 .",

    "the stream s position does not overlap with any of the complex hi - gas features surrounding ngc  4449 @xcite . also , it is on the opposite side of the galaxy with respect to an interesting star cluster that may be linked to another past accretion event @xcite .",

    "we discuss the rgb selection and modeling later , but in general these stars trace a population older than 1 gyr .",
    "we define a grid across the image with @xmath25  pc@xmath26 bins , and count the number of stars in each bin , subsequently applying a gaussian smoothing kernel with @xmath27  pc .",
    "there are typically 79 stars per bin in the stream .",

    "panel ( b ) shows a higher - contrast version of the same map , demonstrating that the main galaxy s pre - existing stellar halo extends out to at least @xmath0  10  kpc . we can furthermore discern a very faint feature that seems to extend the stream s angular path in a loop - like structure",
    "this loop is also apparent in the bbro image , and we infer that the stream is stretched out over at least half its orbit , with the projected turning point at a galactocentric radius of 13  kpc .",
    "we next wish to locate the disrupting satellite galaxy s original center or nucleus . in both the bbro and subaru images",
    "there is a density enhancement near the mid - point of the `` s '' , as would be expected if the `` arms '' are leading and trailing tidal tails around a still marginally - bound , or just disrupting , main body .",
    "we construct a stellar - density contour map for the stream region , using rgb stars and @xmath28  270  pc .",

    "the @xmath40 models appear significantly bluer than the mean rgb color ( by @xmath41  0.13 mag : our systematic color uncertainties are @xmath42  0.1 mag ) , although a @xmath40 , 10 gyr model is consistent with the blue edge of the observed rgb .",
    "presumably a @xmath38  gyr model with @xmath43 would also be consistent with the data , while perhaps providing a better match to the observed cmd slope .",
    "we conclude that , if the bulk of the rgb stars are old ( @xmath44  gyr ) , the metallicity range is roughly @xmath40@xmath45 , while for younger ages the metallicity range shifts to higher values .",
    "these results are comparable to the rgb analysis of the main body of ngc  4449 by a+08 ( their figure  17 ; see also ) . therefore both the main galaxy and",
    "the stream contain similar old , intermediate - metallicity populations , although the main galaxy also contains very young stars , as well as more metal - poor stars as inferred from its globular clusters @xcite .",
    "we provide a preliminary overview of spatial stellar population variations by splitting the rgbs into color - based subpopulations , using the 4  gyr , @xmath39 model as a boundary .",
    "we then create stellar - density maps as before , for the two subpopulations separately . using blue and green color - coding to represent the subpopulations left and right of the model boundary",

    "the stream s bright parts have no visible rgb color gradient , and have an overall color similar to the main galaxy s halo at radii of @xmath0  35  kpc .",
    "both the stream s faint - loop continuation , and the halo at @xmath0  510  kpc , are redder , implying older or more metal - rich stars .",
    "we now proceed to estimate the luminosities and masses of ngc  4449 and its stream . for ngc  4449 , it is straightforward to add up the sdss pixel fluxes inside the `` optical radius '' ( @xmath46  mag  arcsec@xmath8 ) .",
    "we find an extinction - corrected @xmath47 .",
    "for the stream , we use the sdss - calibrated bbro image , integrating the flux within the faintest isophote that closes without including the main galaxy , which corresponds to @xmath48  mag  arcsec@xmath8 and a stream semi - major axis distance of 3  kpc .",
    "we find a stream magnitude of @xmath49 , which is comparable to the brightest local group dsphs , fornax and and  vii .",
    "such galaxies have typical projected half - light radii of @xmath0  0.41.0  kpc @xcite , which is consistent with the stream s @xmath0  0.8  kpc half - width .    for both galaxies ,",
    "these luminosity estimates are lower - limits since they do not include potential extended low - surface - brightness features .",
    "the implied luminosity - ratio is @xmath0  1:50 .    to calculate stellar masses @xmath50",
    ", we use two different approaches , adopting a @xcite initial - mass - function ( imf ; final mass , including stellar remnants ) .",
    "the first is based on the integrated optical colors , following the relations between color and stellar mass - to - light - ratio ( @xmath51 ) from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table b1 ) .",
    "this paper also introduced a technique for mapping out local @xmath51 and @xmath50 variations pixel - by - pixel , which we apply to ngc  4449 , and after integrating , find a total @xmath52 .",
    "for the stream , we assume a global color corresponding to the central sdss measurement , @xmath53 .",
    "we find a stream mass of @xmath54 , implying a stellar mass - ratio between stream and host of @xmath01:50 , for any uniform imf . for ngc  4449 happened to turn out the same as inferred for the stream . ]",
    "the second mass - estimation approach uses the cmd , comparing observed star - counts to predicted numbers from a stellar populations model . for the stream , we use the @xmath55-band stellar luminosity function near the trgb , and normalize it to monte carlo simulations drawn assuming @xmath560.0010.004 , and ages 210 gyr .",
    "we obtain @xmath57  ( 25.5)@xmath58 for the stream ( a lower - limit because of incompleteness ) , which agrees with the color - based results . for the main galaxy , a similar approach was followed by @xcite , whose results imply @xmath59 .",
    "this mass is somewhat higher than by using colors , but the cmd - based stellar - mass - ratio comes out to be similar , @xmath0  1:40 .    remarkably , the mass of ngc  4449 s stellar",
    "halo is similar to the stream s mass : based on the rgb counts of and their normalization to @xmath60-band surface - brightness photometry , we estimate @xmath61 for the halo between projected radii of 510  kpc . this halo could have therefore been built up directly by one or a few past accretion events similar to the present - day stream .",
    "we next consider the dynamical masses of the host galaxy and its stream , including dm .",
    "the quantity that is arguably the most relevant to the current stream - galaxy interaction is the dynamical mass - ratio within the interaction region : the @xmath0  14  kpc galactocentric radius .",
    "based on the hi gas kinematics , we estimate an inclination - corrected circular velocity of @xmath62  km  s@xmath4 at this radius , which means a dynamical mass for the main galaxy of @xmath63  kpc )  @xmath64 .",
    "the hi gas mass is @xmath65 @xcite , so this region is dm - dominated .",
    "note that the @xmath66 and @xmath50 values together suggest that ngc  4449 is intermediate in mass to the lmc and smc ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    for the stream mass , we have no direct measurements , and instead turn to a plausibility argument based on local group dsphs , where the brightest cases have estimated circular velocities of @xmath67  1520  km  s@xmath4 on @xmath0  13  kpc scales @xcite .",
    "then if we assume the @xmath66 values for both stream and main galaxy are fairly constant with radius , the ratio of @xmath68 yields the dynamical mass - ratio .",
    "this ratio is @xmath0  1:201:10 , and thus the stream may be significantly perturbing the main galaxy .",
    "a final metric is the ratio of total ( virial ) halo masses @xmath69 , which are not directly measurable but may be inferred on a statistical basis , assuming a @xmath1cdm framework . in this context , it is well - established that the total mass - to - light - ratios of dwarf galaxies increase dramatically at lower luminosities .",
    "current estimates of @xmath50@xmath69 and luminosity@xmath69 relations @xcite would imply @xmath70  ( 15)@xmath71 for ngc  4449 , and a pre - infall mass of @xmath0  ( 110)@xmath72 for the stream progenitor  which although very uncertain , plausibly implies an initial virial mass - ratio of @xmath0  1:101:5 .",
    "thus what appears to be a very minor merger in visible light may actually be closer to a major merger when including dm .",
    "such an extreme circumstance could be compared with models of satellite disruption and potentially discriminate between @xmath1cdm and alternative theories @xcite .",
    "we have detected and analyzed a stellar tidal stream in the halo of ngc  4449 which we interpret as the ongoing disruption of a dsph galaxy by a larger dwarf ( an lmc / smc analogue  1:15 @xcite . ] ) .",
    "this appears to be the lowest - mass primary galaxy with a verified stellar stream .",
    "we suggest some implications for galaxy evolution .",
    "it has been proposed that dsph s orbiting massive galaxies such as the milky way were `` pre - processed '' from gas - rich dwarfs by tidal effects within dwarf - galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "we may be witnessing such a transformation in - action , with the hi streams surrounding ngc  4449 representing additional tidal debris .",
    "we also suspect it is not just a coincidence that such a novel stream was found first around one of the most intensely star - forming nearby galaxies",
    ". the accretion event may well be the starburst trigger .",
    "the period of elevated star formation appears to have started @xmath0  0.5  gyr ago @xcite , which is suggestively similar to the stream s",
    "@xmath0  12  gyr orbital period  13  kpc , a circular orbit provides a lower - limit for the period of @xmath73  1.3  gyr . ]",
    "( and to any process that is linked to the dynamical time on @xmath0  30  kpc scales ) .",
    "are such accretion events frequent among other dwarf galaxies in recent epochs ?",
    "we suspect that exact analogues to this stream are not very common , or they would have been noticed already in dss / sdss images .",
    "however , if the stream had been only a bit fainter , more diffuse , or at a larger radius , it could have been missed , and thus there may be many more dwarf - hosted stellar streams awaiting detection .    in theory",
    ", the history of dm halo assembly should be fairly scale - free , and @xmath0  1:10 mergers are expected to be the most generally dominant contributors to mass growth @xcite .",
    "it is also increasingly recognized that such relatively minor mergers can have important effects on the larger galaxies , such as inciting global disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "if streams as in ngc  4449 are common in dwarfs , they re - ignite classic ideas about galaxy interactions triggering starbursts . given the high rates of star formation in dwarf galaxies , it is natural to ask if satellites are responsible .",
    "surveys along these lines have produced mixed results , but until now , low - surface - brightness objects such as dsphs would have been missed .",
    "regardless of the implications for starbursts , dsph accretion appears to be an increasingly viable avenue for direct assembly of dwarf galaxies stellar halos  as witnessed by ngc  4449 , and by fornax , which shows traces of swallowing an even smaller dsph @xcite .",
    "future observational determinations of dwarf stream frequency in combination with theoretical models may provide clues to the general substructure problem .",
