    "panel b ) when an interaction among the @xmath1 parallel devices is turned on the approach to carnot efficiency is enabled . ]    increasing the power output of a heat engine has a corresponding cost in terms of reduced efficiency @xmath2 ; or , in equivalent terms , a larger deviation @xmath3 from the carnot efficiency @xmath4 .",
    "a question that is currently the object of vigorous research efforts is whether it is possible to devise a heat engine that outputs finite power at carnot efficiency @xcite . in the following we address this question by focussing on the the following quantity @xmath5 that is the ratio of power output @xmath0 over @xmath6 .",
    "we shall call @xmath7 the performance rate .",
    "it is trivially possible to increase the power without affecting the efficiency by scaling the size of the working substance : an array of @xmath1 identical engines working in parallel provides an @xmath1-fold larger power than each of them , at the same efficiency . in this case the output work per cycle and efficiency scale as @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , consequently @xmath10 ( here the symbol @xmath11 means `` scales as '' ) . note that this linear increase in performance rate does not represent any real gain as it is achieved at the cost of a corresponding linear increase of resources .",
    "the question is therefore `` can the scaling of the performance rate @xmath7 be improved beyond linear '' in order to have a true gain ?",
    "note that a positive answer implies ( in an asymptotic sense ) a positive answer to the fundamental question posed above : imagine to have a working substance made up of @xmath1 constituents ( or resources ) ; if @xmath12 , with @xmath13 , then one could approach carnot efficiency as @xmath14 by increasing @xmath1 , while keeping the `` power per resource '' fixed i.e. , @xmath8 .    in the following we make a substantial step towards answering the question above .",
    "the main idea that we pursue is that an interaction between the @xmath1 constituents of the working substance could provide the extra scaling power that is needed for a positive resolution , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . in order to address that question quantitatively",
    "we consider a special engine cycle that is well studied in the literature ( see , e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) , namely a quantum version of the otto engine  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we show that a universal behaviour , with anomalous scaling of the performance rate @xmath15 emerges when the working substance is on the verge of a second order phase transition . here",
    "@xmath16 are the specific heat , correlation length and dynamical critical exponent , and @xmath17 is the number of dimensions of the working substance .",
    "note that the performance rate contains two concurrent contributions , one stemming from the scaling of the heat capacity , i.e. the exponent @xmath18 , and one stemming from the scaling of the relaxation time , i.e. , the exponent @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath17,@xmath20 , in order to have a more than linear behaviour of @xmath7 one needs a working substance with a critical point characterised by the inequality @xmath21 .",
    "in fact as we explain below in detail , the stronger condition @xmath22 would ensure the asymptotic approach toward the carnot point without giving up power per resource .",
    "is that possible ?",
    "the finiteness of internal energy implies the bound @xmath23 .",
    "critical slowing down ( @xmath24 ) would then imply @xmath25 ( e.g. in the three - dimensional ising model , @xmath26  @xcite , and @xmath27 @xcite hence @xmath28 ) . a number of theoretical and experimental works report on the possibility of the exotic phenomenon of critical speeding up @xmath29 @xcite . in this case",
    "the two terms might add up above unity ( e.g. , recent experimental studies report @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite , hence @xmath32 , for @xmath33 ) .",
    "we conclude that there currently appear to be no fundamental reason hindering the possibility of approaching carnot efficiency without giving up power per resource .",
    "this is certainly possible up to some threshold size @xmath34 for which the weaker condition @xmath21 suffices .",
    "below we illustrate how such powerful critical engines should be designed . at the heart of our result",
    "is the recognition that scaling of the performance , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the work output per cycle , is dictated by the heat capacity of the working substance ( which can notably diverge at the critical point ) , a crucial and simple fact that was never noticed before , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwdlambda ] ) below .",
    "the ws is in thermal equilibrium with bath @xmath37 and @xmath38 . during the first stroke the ws undergoes a thermally isolated transformation where the hamiltonian switches from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the second stroke consists in thermalisation with bath @xmath41 , at @xmath42 being kept fixed at @xmath43 . during the third stroke",
    "the hamiltonian goes back to @xmath39 while in thermal isolation .",
    "the fourth stroke consists in letting the system thermalise with bath @xmath37 , with @xmath42 being kept fixed at @xmath44 . ]      the quantum otto engine ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) is a four - stroke engine based on a working - substance ( ws ) with hamiltonian @xmath45 ( following the current literature we call these engines `` quantum otto engines '' although they bear no other quantum feature besides the discreteness of the spectrum .",

    "( [ eq : eta ] ) the output work of the quantum otto engine can be expressed as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61\\label{eq : w - deltaeta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression allows us to study the performance @xmath62 . in the region where linear approximation hold ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath63 ( namely @xmath64 is close to @xmath65 ) , the scaling of the engine s performance @xmath62 with @xmath1 is given by the scaling of @xmath66 , i.e. the slope of @xmath67 at the origin .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig:3 ] . in the case of @xmath1 devices in parallel",
    "it is @xmath68 ( here @xmath69 denotes the work of each single device ) , hence trivially @xmath70 , and , accordingly @xmath71 , as we noted before .",
    "it follows that in order to boost the scaling of the performance it is necessary to have the slope @xmath66 to scale more than linearly .    ) .",
    "the graph shows various plots of @xmath67 for increasing values of @xmath1 ( from lower to upper curves ) . at a fixed work output ( horizontal red line ) ,",
    "the curves are intercepted at decreasing values of @xmath6 .",
    "if the slope at the origin increases with a power @xmath72 , @xmath73 , then , provided for larger and larger @xmath1 the intercept occurs in the region where the linear approximation holds for the @xmath74 curve , the approach towards @xmath75 occurs as @xmath76 , hence @xmath77 .",
    "similarly , one might rise ( lower ) the value of @xmath36 with @xmath1 , e.g. , as @xmath78 .",
    "accordingly , provided for larger and larger @xmath1 the intercept still occurs in region where the linear approximation holds , the approach towards @xmath75 occurs as @xmath79 .",
    "still , @xmath77 . ]    by taking the derivative of eq . (",
    "[ eq : w - deltaeta ] ) with respect to @xmath6 we obtain the central relation @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the specific heat of the working substance . to understand the physics behind the emergence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwdlambda ] ) , consider working at some point that is very close to the carnot point , i.e. chose @xmath44 and @xmath43 so that their ratio @xmath82 is very close to @xmath83 .",
    "after the adiabatic compression stroke the working substance reaches a new temperature @xmath84 that is very close to the cold bath temperature @xmath85 : @xmath86 , with a small @xmath87 .",
    "the larger the heat capacity @xmath88 of the working substance , at the thermalisation point , the larger the heat exchanged @xmath89 during the subsequent thermalisation with the cold bath . likewise for the subsequent expansion and thermalisation . since @xmath90 , the larger the heat capacity the larger the work output , and accordingly the larger the performance .",
    "( [ eq : dwdlambda ] ) tells us that in order to achieve super - linear scaling of the performance , one needs a working substance with an anomalous scaling of the specific heat .",
    "recall that for ordinary substances , the heat capacity is extensive @xmath91 , namely @xmath92 .",
    "what is needed for improved performance is @xmath93 , with some @xmath13 .",
    "this can happen at the verge of a phase transition .",
    "the physical reason is that at a phase transition finite exchanges of heat are accompanied by infinitesimal changes of temperature , i.e. , the specific heat diverges .",
    "this is because at the transition point the energy intake is not employed to heat up but rather to make the change of phase .    for a second order phase transition ,",
    "finite size scaling predicts a peak in the specific heat whose height and width scale respectively as @xmath94 and @xmath95 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the dimensionality of the system , @xmath18 and @xmath96 are the specific heat and the correlation length critical exponents .",
    "accordingly we predict the possibility of a boosted scaling of the perfmormance @xmath97 . writing the performance rate as @xmath98 we see that its scaling is determined by the scaling of @xmath62 and of the cycle time @xmath99 .",
    "the latter is dominated by the thermalisation time @xcite , which , according to finite size scaling theory scales with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath19 as @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "this gives equation [ eq : pidot ] .",
    "we illustrate how a quantum otto engine can be designed to achieve the predicted performance rate in eq .",
    "[ eq : pidot ] .",
    "let the substance be described by a hamiltonian @xmath48 , displaying , in the infinite size limit , a second order phase transition at the inverse critical temperature @xmath101 .",
    "let the two baths have the inverse temperatures @xmath102 .",
    "we assume we can stretch / compress the spectrum of the working substance and implement accordingly the time dependent hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hi ] ) with @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath42 takes on the value @xmath104 , the critical temperature is rescaled to @xmath105 .",
    "we choose , e.g. , @xmath44 so that @xmath106 ( that is @xmath107 ) . in this way the temperature of the bath @xmath37 coincides with the critical temperature of @xmath108 .",
    "we next choose @xmath43 as the solution of @xmath109 , for some fixed @xmath110 . that gives the corresponding efficiency @xmath111 .",
    "note that since @xmath112 , the power per constituent is fixed : @xmath113 . since the slope of the graph @xmath114 grows with the heat capacity as @xmath97",
    ", we have @xmath115 .",
    "hence if @xmath116 the solution @xmath43 gets closer and closer to @xmath117 .",
    "accordingly the efficiency @xmath118 gets closer and closer to @xmath119 . as discussed in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the previous statement is correct as long as the @xmath43 falls in the region of validity of the linear approximation ( that is , in graphical terms , if the corresponding @xmath6 falls in the region where the curve @xmath114 is well approximated by a straight line passing through the origin ) .",
    "the extension of that region corresponds to the width of the specific heat peak , which as mentioned above , universally scales as @xmath95 .",
    "so , in order to keep pace with the shrinking of the linear approximation region , the approach towards @xmath120 should be not slower than @xmath121 .",
    "since that would occur at a pace of @xmath122 , the condition ensuring that it actually occurs is equation ( [ eq : condition ] ) .    ) at fixed power per constituent .",
    "plots were calculated with critical indices reported recently for @xmath33 , namely @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath96 was obtained from the relation @xmath123 @xcite , carnot point was at @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the inset shows the quantity @xmath126 as a function of @xmath1 , that is the exponent characterising the approach to the carnot point that reaches the expected value @xmath127 .",
    "panel b ) rescaled output work @xmath128 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "note that the linear region shrinks around the origin of axes as @xmath1 increases , and that the intercept with @xmath129 occurs within that region for all curves . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4].a we illustrate how in such a case , the engine design that we have described above actually results in an asymptotic approach towards the carnot point , at fixed power per constituent .",
    "[ fig:4].b illustrates the shrinking of the linear region , due to the narrowing of the peak width . in making fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we have taken full advantage of one of the most striking aspects of our analysis , namely its universality .",
    "the details of the specific model are not essential , all that counts are the critical exponents .",
    "the specific heat peak reads @xmath130 where @xmath131 is some bell shaped function ( its exact shape is not relevant ) .",
    "the according internal energy of the working substance around the critical point reads @xmath132 where @xmath133 .",
    "the plots are obtained by using the latter with eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) to evaluate the work output , with the choice @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the plot illustrates the approach towards carnot efficiency at fixed power per constituent , with the predicted scaling exponent @xmath136 .",
    "the idea that phase transitions could enable the attainment of carnot efficiency at finite power was previously hinted by polettini _",
    "@xcite , but was never pursued before .",
    "the present work confirms that intuition in fully fledged way based on universality and finite - size scaling theory and most importantly by accounting for the first time for the effect of criticality on the time of operation hence of the power .    as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , independent on how the slope @xmath66 scales , it is @xmath137 , hence exactly at the carnot point all quantum otto engines deliver null work hence null power .",
    "our statement should be accordingly understood in a weaker asymptotic sense , namely , that it is possible to get as close as one wants to the carnot point without giving up power per constituent .",
    "this is the viewpoint that also inspires ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we remark that our linear condition @xmath138 substantially differs from the condition of linear response regime ( i.e. @xmath139 or @xmath140 ) that was investigated previously in @xcite . in our case the two temperatures need not be close to each other .",
    "we stress that all obstacles hindering the realisation of the critical powerful carnot engines appear to be of technological nature , rather than fundamental .",
    "one major difficulty stems from the necessity of implementing the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hi ] ) containing a global coupling @xmath141 , which can be very challenging in practice .",
    "another difficulty stems from the fact that in order to be able to asymptotically approach the carnot point , one should accordingly have an increasing degree of accuracy with which @xmath44 and @xmath43 are controlled .",
    "lastly it is worth stressing that the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dwdlambda ] ) holds in general as a consequence of the linear approximation valid for @xmath63 , and is accordingly not restricted to the case of critical phenomena .",
    "this tells that one route toward the improvement of the performance of a working substance is to increase its specific heat .",
    "that could be achieved by increasing its number of constituents , a possibility that we have investigated here , or by manipulating any other parameter entering the hamiltonian @xmath48 .",
