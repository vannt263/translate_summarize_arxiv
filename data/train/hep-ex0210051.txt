    "the hadron hose is a current - carrying wire used to instrument the decay volume of a conventional neutrino beam with a toroidal focusing field for a sign - selected meson beam .",
    "conventional neutrino beams are tertiary beams , with the primary proton beam producing @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson secondaries in a target .",
    "beamline elements downstream of the target , called horns @xcite , produce a toroidal magnetic field to sign- and momentum- select the mesons , focusing them toward an evacuated or helium - filled volume , where the mesons decay into the tertiary neutrino beam .",
    "steel and earth shielding absorb remnant protons , mesons , and muons at the end of the decay volume ( see figure  [ numinohose ] ) .    in conventional neutrino beams",
    "to date @xcite the mesons freely propagate through the decay volume .",
    "the toroidal field of the hadron hose provides continuous focusing of the secondary meson beam throughout the decay volume .",
    "mesons spiral around the hose wire and are drawn away from the decay volume walls where they might interact before decaying .",
    "a pion orbit in the numi beamline with the hadron hose is shown in figure  [ numihose ] .",
    "the spiraling motion randomizes the decay angles of the mesons , which reduces the need to model detector and beamline acceptances in monte carlo calculations of the expected neutrino fluxes at the detectors .",
    "toroidal magnetic fields have been used for plasma beams @xcite and the possibility of using toroidal fields to focus charged particle beams was noted by van  der  meer @xcite . in this article , we study the utility of such a focusing system for neutrino beams and the technical feasibility of placing such a wire in an evacuated region with high particle fluences . while we have developed this device for the neutrinos at the main injector ( numi ) project , such a system might be of utility at future neutrino facilities such as the jhf @xcite or conventional neutrino `` super beams '' @xcite .",
    "this article procedes as follows : we discuss the focusing properties of the hose in sections  [ numi ]  -  [ hose ] .",
    "sections  [ requirements]-[elecdesign ] present the mechanical and electrical design which was proposed for numi .",
    "sections  [ breakdown ] through [ radiological ] discuss some of the hardware studies to demonstrate that the hose wire can survive in the radiation field of a neutrino beamline without significant failure of wire segments .",
    "section  [ conclude ] concludes .",
    "for numi , 120  gev protons will be extracted from the main injector @xcite and focused downward by 58  mrad , to strike a 0.94  m long graphite target .",
    "the bunch length is @xmath2sec , and the cycle time @xmath3  sec .",
    "the beamline is designed for @xmath4 protons / pulse and @xmath5 protons / year .",
    "numi will have two focusing horns @xcite pulsed at 200  ka after the target .",
    "the secondary hadrons enter a 675 m long , 1  m radius evacuated decay volume .",
    "minos @xcite is a 2-detector neutrino experiment .",
    "a 980  ton near detector measures the neutrino energy spectrum and rate produced at fermilab . a 5400  ton",
    "far detector is located in the soudan mine in minnesota , 735  km from fermilab .",
    "the numi beam can be adapted to produce a low ( @xmath6  gev ) , medium ( @xmath7  gev ) , or high ( @xmath8  gev ) energy neutrino event spectrum .",
    "figure  [ lespectra ] shows the expected spectra in the two detectors for the low - energy and high - energy beam options assuming no new physics resulting in neutrino disappearance . in figure",
    "[ lespectra ] , the vertical axis is the number of expected charged current neutrino interactions expected per kiloton of detector mass per @xmath9  protons on target ( @xmath101  numi  year ) .",
    "the neutrinos in the peaks of the spectra of figure  [ lespectra ] come from pions focused by the horns , whereas the neutrinos in the high energy tail come from poorly focused pions ( pions that travel through the necks of the horns ) .",
    "the high energy tail is nonetheless important to the experiment because it provides us a control sample to demonstrate a region without oscillation effects .",
    "oscillation with @xmath11  ev@xmath12 results in a depletion of neutrinos centered around 1.8 - 3.0  gev , while the spectrum above 10  gev is unchanged . ]",
    "it is important to make the best prediction of the far - field energy spectrum to search for any kind of spectral distortions .",
    "it is desirable to have the neutrino energy spectra at the two detector sites as similar as possible so that the near detector site strongly constrains the calculation of the spectrum at the far site .",
    "any relative difference observed at the far detector is evidence for new physics such as neutrino oscillations . in practice ,",
    "the two detector spectra are not identical : the vastly different solid angles subtended by the two detectors results in an energy - dependent acceptance difference .",
    "this difference is evident in the neutrino spectra of figure  [ lespectra ] .    )",

    "minos detectors , computed without ( above ) and with ( below ) the hadron hose .",
    "the left plots are for the numi low - energy beam and the right are for the high energy beam .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the acceptance difference between the two detectors is accounted for in the `` far - to - near ratio '' , which is the factor by which the near detector spectrum must be multiplied to predict the far detector spectrum . it is defined as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the observed number of events in the @xmath15 energy bin in the near detector , and @xmath16 is the predicted number of events in the @xmath15 bin in the far in the absence of new physics .",
    "uncertainties in the calculation of @xmath17 lead to systematic uncertainties in the predicted far detector spectrum which limit the ultimate reach of physics searches .",
    "the calculation of @xmath17 is complicated by the extended length and finite aperture of the neutrino beam geometry .",
    "if the neutrinos were produced from a point source , then @xmath17 could be estimated by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the distance from the target to the near ( far ) neutrino detector . considering that neutrino beamlines are an extended source",
    ", one could weight this extrapolation factor by the pion lifetime along the length of the decay tunnel : @xmath21 where the integral is over the length of the decay tunnel ( 725  m in the case of the numi beamline ) and the substitution @xmath22 has been made .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    however , even this estimate of the near - far extrapolation is a simplification : not all decaying pions produce neutrinos within the finite acceptances of the two detectors and not all pions are able to decay before interacting along the decay pipe walls .",
    "furthermore , the correct relation between the pion and neutrino energy is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion relativistic boost and @xmath25 is the decay angle of the pion . in fact , because low - momentum pions tend to enter the decay volume at wider angles and decay far upstream in the decay volume , while high - momentum pions tend to propagate much further , the acceptance of the near detector for high momentum neutrinos is larger than for low - momentum neutrinos .",
    "the acceptance correction @xmath26@xmath27 given in equation  [ rfneqn ] is incorrect in an energy - dependent manner because of the correlation in equation  [ enrgycorrel ] .",
    "a more detailed extrapolation of the measured near spectrum to the far detector requires a monte carlo calculation which tracks secondary hadrons produced in the target through the beamline optics .",
    "a comparison of the naive calculation of equation  [ rfneqn ] to a geant @xcite simulation of the numi beamline is shown in figure  [ modelspread ] .",
    "the hadron hose consists of a wire at the center of the decay tunnel and carries a 1000  a peak current pulse .",
    "the current provides a toroidal magnetic field which continually focuses positive particles back toward the center of the decay pipe . a typical meson executes 2 - 3 orbits around the wire over the length of the decay pipe .",
    "the hadron hose contributes three essential features .",
    "first , @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s that otherwise diverge out to the decay pipe walls and interact before they decay are given a restoring force back to the decay pipe center .",
    "thus , @xmath0s/@xmath1 s travel farther and have a greater chance to decay , so the neutrino event rate in the far detector is increased ( see table  [ fluxes ] ) .",
    "second , the pion decay distribution along the beamline direction more nearly follows a simple exponential , which reduces the difference in acceptance of the near detector to low - momentum _ vs. _ high - momentum pions .",
    "thus , the extrapolation factor @xmath26@xmath27 more closely follows that given by the pion lifetime in equation  [ rfneqn ] , as can be seen in figure  [ modelspread ] .",
    "third , the pion orbits effectively randomize the decay angle between the pion direction and the neutrino that hits the minos near and far detectors .",
    "this randomization washes out the kinematic correlation between neutrino energy and decay angle in equation  [ enrgycorrel ] , which otherwise always produces a softer spectrum in the near detector than the far detector .",
    "the difference is especially visible at the high energy edge of the high energy beam in figure  [ lespectra ] .",
    "the randomization is a larger effect for the high energy beam because the lorentz boost at high energy otherwise increases the sensitivity to the decay angle in equation  [ rfneqn ] .",
    "the effect is also demonstrated in figure  [ nearfarangles ] , which plots the ratio of neutrino energies in the near and far detector that would arise from the decay of a given pion in the low - energy or high - energy numi beam configurations .",
    ".charged current event yields in the far minos detector in the low and high energy beam configurations , with and without hadron hose .",
    "the peak refers to the regions @xmath286 and 30 gev , for low and high energy beams , while overall refers to @xmath29 gev .",
    "the units are events per kiloton of far detector mass per @xmath30  protons on target . [",

    "we have investigated the potential impact of a new focusing system , the hadron hose , for conventional neutrino beams .",
    "this system was developed for the numi beam at fermilab , and may be of benefit to future conventional super beams because of its increase in neutrino event yield and ability to control systematic uncertainties due to particle production in the target or imperfections in the rest of the neutrino beam elements .",
