    "since the separatrix at which we start the labelling is arbitrary , we only need to enumerate permutations up to conjugation by cyclic permutations .",
    "a diagram makes sense if the ribbons which follow unions of separatrices above or below form compatible bottoms and tops of cylinders .",
    "so , given a permutation , we look for the cycles of @xmath550 and of @xmath1765 defined by @xmath1766 and then look for all the ways to match them .",
    "a first example : @xmath1767 gives the diagram on figure  2 .",
    "in this example , @xmath550 has cycles @xmath1768 , while @xmath1765 has only one cycle @xmath1769 , therefore there is no possible pairing .",
    "we ca nt glue any cylinders on this separatrix diagram , there would need to be five bottoms of cylinders and only one top of cylinder .",
    "another example : @xmath1770 gives the diagram on figure  3 . in this example , @xmath550 has cycles @xmath1771 , while @xmath1765 has cycles @xmath1772 , and two pairings are possible : cylinders can fit on this separatrix diagram in two different ways .",
    "as checked with sage , there are exactly 16 permutations @xmath550 of @xmath1773 ( up to cyclic permutation ) for which @xmath550 and @xmath1765 have the same number of cycles .",
    "the corresponding pairs @xmath1774 are listed below , expressed as products of nontrivial cycles .",
    "it turns out that each of them gives one , two or three cylinder diagrams , and we get 22 cylinder diagrams in all .",
    "below , we list next to each of these 16 pairs @xmath1774 the associated cylinder diagrams and , furthermore , for each cylinder diagram , we put the letter @xmath948 , resp .",
    "@xmath1111 , when the corresponding translation surfaces belong the the hyperelliptic , resp .",
