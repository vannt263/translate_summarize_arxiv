    "the @xmath0 particle was firstly introduced by gell - mann and levy in association with the linear @xmath0 model.@xcite in such a model , the @xmath0 meson develops a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value which triggers the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "pions act as the ( pseudo-)goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath2sb ) . in the linear @xmath0 model the @xmath0 meson fills in the linear chiral multiplet together with pions .",
    "the @xmath0 and the pion fields transform and mix with each other under chiral rotations , and before s@xmath2sb the @xmath0 field and the @xmath3 field were essentially the same .",
    "what is described above only repeats standard text book content .",
    "the question is then whether the theory can accomodate for experimental data .",
    "early studies on nuclear physics require @xmath0 in order to cancel the large @xmath3n scattering lengths caused by the @xmath3 nucleon born term .",
    "@xcite however these studies are based on models with linearly realized chiral symmetry . in such models",
    ", there must exist a large cancelation between the @xmath0 contribution and the @xmath3 contribution at low energies in order to obey various constraints from soft pion theorems .",
    "one example of the latter is the adler zero condition .",
    "non - linear realization of chiral symmetry was later discovered ,  @xcite which satisfies all low energy theorems induced by pcac .",
    "@xcite hence it is suggested that the @xmath0 is not necessary for chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "chiral perturbation @xmath4 ( @xmath2pt ) is established based on the non - linear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "@xcite it is a model independent approach and successfully describes strong interaction physics at ( very ) low energies .",
    "furthermore it was shown that the ( renormalizable ) linear @xmath0 model is not qcd at low energies .",
    "@xcite    on the other side , remarkable efforts have been made by physicists who insist on the existence of @xmath0 meson , which led to the return of the @xmath0 meson in pdg after disappearing for more than 30 years.@xcite most of these studies and hence conclusions are model dependent , but are however important in keeping the thoughts on the right trajectory . on experimental side , it is also very difficult to claim the discovery of the @xmath0 pole from experimental data , since the @xmath0 meson , if exists , has to be a very broad resonance . in other words",
    ", @xmath5 wave i=0 channel @xmath6 interaction at low energies is of highly non - perturbative , strong interaction nature .",
    "it is not easy to extract the @xmath0 pole from the background contributions .",
    "resonance , and how can they be overcome , have been reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "] as a consequence , previous conclusions in supporting the existence of the @xmath0 meson are not very convincing .",
    "the situation still seemed to be rather confusing : chiral perturbation theory does not seem to support the existence of the @xmath0 meson . on the other hand ,",
    "see fig .  1 , the steady rise of the i , j=0,0 channel @xmath6 scattering phase shift data below 1gev , provided by the old cern - munich collaboration , left a big puzzle for imagination .    in my personal opinion , the clearest way to reveal the very existence of the @xmath0 meson hidden behind the phase shift data in fig .",
    "[ 00phaseshift ] may be to write down a dispersion relation for the @xmath7.@xcite define @xmath8 it is easy to understand that @xmath9 is analytic across the elastic cut of @xmath6 elastic scattering and @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "one assumes a high energy regge behavior for the partial wave amplitude , hence @xmath9 satisfies a once - subtracted dispersion relation,@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a subtraction constant and the rest contribution to @xmath9 come either from poles or cuts . for @xmath14 scatterings",
    "@xmath15 $ ] and r starts from first inelastic threshold , practically @xmath16 .",
    "the right hand cut can be estimated using experimental data and it is found that its contribution is not important at low energies .",
    "the left hand cut is estimated using @xmath2pt . as seen in fig .  2 , the left hand cut contribution to the phase shift is negative and concave whereas the experimental data curve on @xmath7 is positive and convex . comparing with fig .  1 , fig .",
    "2 clearly demonstrates that it is necessary to include the @xmath0 meson to adjust chiral perturbation theory to experiments , according to eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) .",
    "evidences for the existence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are also reported in recent years production experiments  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "because the physics related to the @xmath0 meson and the @xmath1 meson in @xmath5 wave i=1/2 channel @xmath17 scatterings are of highly non - perturbative nature , a dispersive analysis is hence needed to extract the physical information in a model independent way . in the next we briefly review a new dispersive approach we have developed which is particularly suitable to study low lying resonance structure .",
    "one constructs , using analyticity , unitarity , and @xmath19 @xmath20 dispersion relations , a factorized form for elastic scattering @xmath18 matrix element:@xcite@xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath23-th @xmath24 sheet pole contribution and @xmath25 denotes the contribution from cuts or background .",
    "the information from higher sheet poles is hidden in the right hand integral which consists of one part of the total background contribution , @xmath26 the ` left hand ' cut @xmath27 $ ] for equal mass scatterings and may contain a rather complicated structure for unequal mass scatterings .",
    "the right hand cut @xmath28 starts from first inelastic threshold to positive infinity .",
    "it can be demonstrated@xcite that the dispersive representation for @xmath29 is free from the subtraction constant .",
    "again the right hand cut can be estimated from experimental input .",
    "nearby left hand cut ( @xmath30 for @xmath6 scatterings if assuming mandelstam representation ) can in principle be estimated from experimental data as well , using froissart ",
    "gribov projection formula .",
    "nevertheless , one expects such an estimate gives more or less the same effect as using @xmath2pt results when estimating the nearby left cut .",
    "there is no reliable way to estimate further left hand cut effects , nevertheless physics around physical threshold should not be strongly affected by what might happen far away in the complex @xmath5 plane . moreover , further left cut contribution as defined by eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) is very mild which is understood by the fact that the integrand appeared in eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) is of logarithmic form .",
    "numerical evaluation justifies this argument.@xcite-@xcite    estimates in various channels of @xmath6 and @xmath17 scatterings reveal a common feature : all the background contributions as defined in eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) are numerically found to be negative !",
    "this fact is actually crucial to establish the existence of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pole in the present approach and also helps greatly in stabilizing the pole location in the data fit .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , there actually exists a correspondence of eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) in quantum mechanical scattering theory , obtained sixty years ago:@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ( single ) channel momentum and @xmath33 pole locations in the complex @xmath32 plane .",
    "the above formula is written down for any finite range potential , in @xmath5 wave .",
    "it amazing to notice that the eq .",
    "( [ nhu ] ) automatically predicts a negative background contribution !      the eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) can actually be understood as a simple combination of single channel unitarity and the partial wave dispersion relation.@xcite in the data fit it is found that the parametrization form is sensitive to @xmath18 matrix poles not too far away from physical threshold , hence providing a useful tool to explore the broad resonance @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in the data",
    "fit it is found that crossing symmetry also plays an important role in fixing the @xmath0 pole location .",
    "taking this fact into account@xcite it gives the @xmath0 pole location at @xmath34 in good agreement with the determination using more sophisticated roy equation analysis.@xcite the application of eq .",
    "( [ separable ] ) to lass data@xcite also unambiguously establish the existence of the @xmath1 meson with the pole location:@xcite @xmath35 which are also in agreement with the later determination on @xmath1 pole parameters using roy ",
    "though the existence of the broad @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are firmly established , its nature remains somewhat mysterious .",
    "especially the question remains completely open on how to understand it from the underlining theory , qcd .",
    "though it is natural to attempt to relate @xmath36 or the @xmath0 meson to the quantum excitation of the order parameter @xmath37 , a proof at the fundamental level is still missing . the first thing to notice is that the similarity between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 excludes very likely the possibility that the @xmath0 contains a large gluball component .",
    "efforts have been made in trying to understand the @xmath0 meson using lattice qcd technique,@xcite but the approach is still at the stage of prematurity .",
    "most papers devoted to the study of physical interpretation of the @xmath0 or @xmath36 meson are at phenomenological level , using for example , linear sigma model at hadron level,@xcite at quark level@xcite , or the enjl model@xcite . also the @xmath0 meson are considered as a tetra quark state,@xcite as a dynamically generated resonance from chiral perturbation theory lagrangian,@xcite or as a resonance generated from 3p@xmath38 potential model.@xcite    it is of course very helpful , when trying to understand @xmath0 , to investigate the @xmath1 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 simultaneously .",
    "one of the most challenging problem is to understand not only the mass spectrum but also the widely spread widths between these lightest scalars in different channels .",
    "this is recently reinvestigated using the enjl model.@xcite it is found that the masses and widths of these lightest scalars , except the @xmath39 , can be understood simultaneously , taking them as the chiral partners of the @xmath41 pseudo - goldstone bosons , within linearly realized chiral symmetry.@xcite the estimate is very crude because it is based upon a @xmath42-matrix unitarization approach .",
    "but one may hope the study may be of help to grasp the major physics and the qualitative picture presented by these lightest scalars .",
    "an examination to the unitarized chiral perturbative amplitudes finds a light and broad pole on the complex @xmath5 plane , in the i , j=0,0 channel of @xmath6 scatterings .",
    "it is also found that the @xmath43 trajectory of the @xmath0 meson has a non - typical behavior as comparing with that of a normal resonance , e.g. , a @xmath44 pole .",
    "hence it is argued that the @xmath0 is a dynamically generated resonance from a lagrangian without the @xmath0 degree of freedom.@xcite .",
    "this idea has been carefully examined@xcite , and it is found that the [ 1,1 ] pad approximation leads to a ` @xmath0 ' pole falling back to the real @xmath5 axis in the large @xmath43 limit . a correct understanding to what does the [ 1,1 ] pad approximant mean is obtained through these studies .",
    "it is also pointed out that the bent structure of the @xmath0 pole trajectory with respect to @xmath43 found in [ 1,1 ] pad approximant is in qualitative agreement with what one finds in @xmath45 @xmath0 model , hence suggesting a fundamental role of the light and broad resonance pole played at lagrangian level , even though it can be generated from certain dynamical approximations.@xcite    on the other hand , both lattice simulation@xcite or qcd sum rule ( sr ) approach@xcite seem to suggest that the ` @xmath0 ' pole couples strongly to quark quadru - linear currents . based on this observation , one may argue that the @xmath0 is a tetra quark state .",
    "nevertheless at low energies quark and gluons are not the appropriate degrees of freedom to interpret qcd . to understand this ,",
    "let us ask a question whether a pion is a @xmath46 state .",
    "we know that @xmath3 is a pseudo - goldstone boson , i.e. , a collective excitation of qcd .",
    "hence in the chiral limit , the pion wave function in the fock space expansion contains equally important @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 components .",
    "then can one conclude that @xmath3 is not a @xmath46 state , even if it contains @xmath46 as the leading component providing the quantum number ?",
    "if the @xmath0 meson is the chiral partner of the @xmath3 field in a lagrangian with a linear realization of chiral symmetry , it must share many properties of the pion field , i.e , being also a collective excitation .",
    "the lattice or qcd sr results , in my opinion , seem to support this simple picture that the @xmath0 is indeed the chiral partner of the @xmath3 fields .",
    "the leading component in the @xmath0 wave function is still @xmath50 with vacuum quantum number .",
    "actually the clearest way to see the @xmath51 component is in the large @xmath43 limit , where @xmath51 becomes dominant , otherwise the amplitude will have difficulty to fulfil the requirements of crossing symmetry and analyticity . @xcite",
    "therefore a calculation in lattice or qcd sr with a @xmath46 component would be more realistic and welcome.@xcite    furthermore , a quark quadru - linear current is actually not distinguishable from a product of two quark bi - linear current . in this sense",
    "it is also ambiguous to state that the @xmath0 meson is a tetra quark state even if there is a large @xmath47 component inside the @xmath0 .",
    "the only un - ambiguous way to explore the tetra quark state is through searching for states with exotic quantum numbers .",
    "however , it is shown that such states in general are at least not favorable to be formed.@xcite    to summarize , the results obtained so far from theoretical studies to the @xmath0 meson are well consistent with the picture that it is the chiral partner of the pesudo - goldstone bosons of qcd .",
    "the @xmath0 meson contains a @xmath46 seed , but is heavily renormalized by @xmath6 continuum .",
    "the latter shifts its pole from near real axis to a place deep in the @xmath5 plane .",
