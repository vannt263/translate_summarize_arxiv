    "in recent years electrical transport through confined regions has seen impressive theoretical and experimental activity .",
    "several well known phenomena have received renewed attention due to the present possibility of studying them in novel and more controllable situations .",
    "for instance , andreev scattering ( andreev 1964 ) , according to which a particle - like excitation impinging on a normal metal - superconductor interface is reflected back as a hole - like excitation , has been shown to be the key mechanism controlling transport in a variety of hybrid mesoscopic superconducting devices .",
    "( for a review see , for example , hekking , schn , and averin 1994 , beenakker 1995 , lambert and raimondi 1998 ) . at the same time , electron - electron interaction in small confined regions , or quantum dots ( qds ) , has been shown to lead to the so - called coulomb blockade of electrical transport .",
    "this occurs at low temperatures , when the fermi energy of the contacts falls in the gap between the ground state energies of the dot with @xmath1 and @xmath2 electrons ( kastner 1992 ) .",
    "however , a qd attached to metallic leads resembles an impurity level in a metal . as a consequence , even in the coulomb blockade regime",
    ", transport will occur due to the kondo effect ( glazman and raikh 1988 , ng 1988 ) .",
    "this is due to the formation of a spin singlet between the impurity level and the conduction electrons , which gives rise to a quasiparticle peak at the fermi energy in the dot spectral function .",
    "this suggestion has been explored theoretically by several groups ( meir , wingreen , and lee 1991,1993 , ng 1993 , levy yeyati , martin - rodero , and flores 1993 , schoeller and schn 1994 , hettler and schoeller 1995 ) .",
    "this has lead to the prediction of a zero - bias anomaly in the current voltage characteristics and an increase of the linear conductance in the coulomb blockade regime for decreasing temperature .",
    "such phenomena have indeed been observed in different qd systems ( ralph and buhrman 1994 , goldhaber - gordon et al .",
    "1998 , cronenwett et al . 1998 ) .    what will happen if the qd is coupled to a normal and a superconducting lead as shown schematically in fig.[fig_bag_dot ] ?",
    "does the zero - bias anomaly observed in the n - qd - n case survive in the n - qd - s case ?",
    "such a problem has been investigated recently by various groups ( fazio and raimondi 1998 , k. kang 1999 , schwab and raimondi 1999 , sun , wang , and lin 1999 , clerk , ambegaokar , hershfield 1999 ) . in this paper",
    "we review mainly the work done in refs .",
    "( fazio and raimondi 1998 ) and ( schwab and raimondi 1999 ) .",
    "the problem one is faced with has all the difficulty of the original kondo problem .",
    "it is well known that in the limits of high and low temperatures ( here high and low are with respect to the kondo temperature ) , qualitatively correct results are obtained by means of different techniques .",
    "such an attitude we adopt here , having in mind to analyze the interplay between andreev scattering and kondo physics .",
    "we use a simple equation - of - motion approach in the perturbative regime above the kondo temperature .",
    "this corresponds to taking into account only the leading logarithmic corrections in the renormalization group sense .",
    "the cross - over behaviour to low temperature may be rather complicated , but as happens in the standard kondo problem , we expect that the extreme low - temperature phase can be described in simple terms .",
    "such a description is obtained by means of the slave - boson technique in a mean - field approximation . in the high temperature regime",
    ", we find a suppressed andreev current at low bias voltage due to the competition between the coulomb energy and the superconducting proximity effect in the qd . in the low - temperature case , in contrast , our analysis predicts that the linear conductance of the n - qd - s system is enhanced as compared to the normal case and may reach the maximum universal value of @xmath3 which is twice the maximum for the n - qd - n system .    before entering the technical details",
    ", it is also worthwhile discussing the relevant energy scales . in investigating andreev scattering at a normal metal - superconductor interface one",
    "is often interested in voltages and temperatures well below the energy scale set by the superconducting gap @xmath4 and one could be tempted to take @xmath5 from the outset .",
    "however , the dot charging energy @xmath6 ( see below ) introduces another energy scale into the problem , and the physics is different in the two limits @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in order to appreciate this point ,",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of an isolated qd , plus a term which models andreev scattering in the limit @xmath5 by @xmath9 .",
    "for this hamiltonian the off - diagonal element of the inverse dot green s function reads @xmath10\\rbrace$ ] and vanishes in the @xmath11 limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the limiting sequence @xmath5 first , @xmath11 after , the induced superconductivity and hence transport in the dot is completely suppressed . in order to have andreev scattering in the large @xmath6 limit two electrons have to enter the superconductor without doubly occupying the qd .",
    "this can only happen on a time scale of the order @xmath12 .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the limit @xmath13 in the following analysis .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive a formula for the current through the dot in the presence of andreev scattering . calculating",
    "the current explicitly requires the dot green s function . in sections iii and iv we present the equation - of - motion and slave - boson approaches , respectively .",
    "a few conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "in this section we define the system under consideration and derive an expression for the andreev current which holds in the presence of electron - electron interaction .",
    "the model hamiltonian for the n - qd - s system is @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , are the hamiltonians of the normal and the superconducting leads ( @xmath17 being the superconducting gap ) , @xmath18 @xmath19 if we restrict ourselves to temperatures and bias voltages much smaller than the average level spacing in the qd , then transport occurs through a single level . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dot @xmath20 reads @xmath21 the level @xmath22 is assumed to be spin degenerate and the electron - electron interaction is included through the on - site repulsion @xmath6 ( @xmath23k for currently fabricated qds ) .",
    "experimentally the position of the dot level can be modulated by an external gate voltage .",
    "tunneling between the leads and the dot is described by @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the starting point for deriving the current formula is @xmath29 $ ] where @xmath30 is the electron number operator in the normal lead . in the case of a hybrid structure , like the one we are considering now",
    ", it turns out to be more convenient to evaluate the current in the normal lead .",
    "the average current can be rewritten as follows @xmath31 since we deal with a nonequilibrium situation we work in the framework of the keldysh technique , as employed in the literature ( meir and wingreen 1992 ) . by introducing the nambu notation @xmath32 the average current in eq.([current ] ) requires the evaluation of the lesser green s function @xmath33 which , by means of the dyson equation , can be expressed in terms of the exact green s function @xmath34 of the qd and the free green s function of the normal lead @xmath35 .",
    "the lesser component of the dyson equation reads @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 are the retarded ( advanced ) and the lesser green s functions of the dot ( for example @xmath39 ) . using the relation @xmath40 and the expression for the green s functions in the normal lead ( diagonal in nambu space ) @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 is the fermi function ) , it is possible to rewrite the current in the following form @xmath44{\\hat { g}}^a(\\epsilon ) \\rbrace & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the formula above , we introduced the elastic rate @xmath45 .",
    "the diagonal matrix @xmath46 has elements @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the normal electrode is kept at a chemical potential @xmath49 while that of the superconductor is fixed to zero .    up to",
    "now no approximations were involved . in order to determine the current an expression for the self - energy of the qd should be found .",
    "a determination of @xmath50 requires both the lesser and retarded parts of the self - energy .",
    "we formulate an ansatz for the lesser green s function which is expressed solely in terms of the retarded one .",
    "this ansatz automatically guarantees current conservation .",
    "this generalizes an ansatz put forward by ( ng 1996 ) for two normal leads to the calculation of @xmath51 in the presence of a superconducting lead .    in order to understand how the ansatz is constructed it is useful to start from the noninteracting dot . in this case , @xmath52 can be computed exactly and it is expressed in terms of the retarded and advanced self - energies as @xmath53\\ ] ] @xmath54-&\\cr   & [ { \\hat 1}-{\\hat { f}}_{\\eta } ( \\epsilon)]{\\hat { \\sigma}}_{0,\\eta}^a(\\epsilon)\\}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case ( with no interaction ) the nonequilibrium self - energy has the same form as in equilibrium but with the fermi functions of the two leads kept at different chemical potentials .",
    "the idea is to assume that even in the presence of interaction the dependence on the fermi distribution is the same and that both the lesser and the greater functions depend on a single function @xmath55 such that @xmath56 the matrix @xmath55 is determined by the condition @xmath57 which is a general property of the keldysh green s functions .",
    "as already mentioned , this ansatz leads to current conservation .",
    "moreover it is exact both in the non - interacting limit , @xmath58 , and in absence of superconductivity , @xmath59 . as a result @xmath60 eq.([intselfapp ] ) allows us to evaluate the expression of the current ( [ current3 ] ) , once we know the retarded green s function of the dot .",
    "the expression for the current can be greatly simplified in the relevant limit @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the non - interacting self - energy due to the superconducting lead @xmath62 is real and purely off - diagonal whereas that due to the normal lead , @xmath63 , is diagonal . using these properties of the self - energy and substituting eq.([intselfapp ] ) in eq.([current3 ] )",
    "we obtain the following form for the andreev current through a qd .",

    "our aim is to find an equation for the dot s green s function @xmath65 \\rangle$ ] .",
    "the retarded and advanced green s functions necessary for the evaluation of the current can easily be obtained from the time - ordered one . in this section",
    "we will describe the equation - of - motion approach .",
    "it is useful to introduce quasiparticle operators by performing a bogolubov transformation @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . in the normal lead",
    "we have @xmath70 and the bogolubov transformation reduces to the identity transformation .",
    "the hopping term becomes in the quasiparticle basis @xmath71 the nambu formalism is introduced for the @xmath72 operator via @xmath73 .",
    "we start by writing down the equation of motion for the operators @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath76 in the equation for @xmath74 , the new operator @xmath77 , appears because of the interaction .",
    "it is straightforward to iterate once the equation of motion and get an equation for @xmath78 @xmath79 & , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 here the superscript @xmath81 means the transpose . in eq.([eom8 ] ) again several new operators have appeared . in order to get a closed system of equations one has to truncate the hierarchy at some point . following the decoupling procedure used in the absence of superconducting leads ( meir , wingreen and lee 1991 ) , we neglect correlations in the leads . to see how this is achieved , consider the general structure of all the new operators entering eq.([eom8 ] ) for @xmath82 .",
    "they are products of two @xmath83 and one @xmath84 operator . by iterating once more",
    "the equation of motion one obtains new terms which contain two @xmath84 and one @xmath83 operator .",
    "the approximation consists then in replacing a pair of two such @xmath84 operators with their statistical average .",
    "in such a way all the new operators entering the eq.([eom8 ] ) for @xmath82 can be expressed in terms of @xmath82 itself and @xmath85 .",
    "a further approximation is done by considering the limit of large coulomb interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath86 . in this case",
    "one can safely neglect , in the third order of iteration of the equation of motion , all operators having two creation or two annihilation @xmath83 operators , because they will give rise to terms of the order @xmath87 .",
    "we write here the resulting equations of motion for @xmath88 and @xmath89 \\right\\rangle$ ] .",
    "they are @xmath90 and the equation for the single particle green s function becomes @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the noninteracting self - energy @xmath93 is obtained as @xmath94 with @xmath95 for the calculation of the interacting self - energy @xmath96 we assume that in the superconducting reservoir there are no quasiparticles present ( we consider energies much smaller than the gap @xmath97 ) @xmath98 , and that in the normal reservoir the quasiparticle population follows the fermi distribution @xmath99 .",
    "we then have @xmath100    @xmath101    in what follows , we consider @xmath102 with @xmath103 the bandwidth .",
    "the self - energy @xmath104 is weakly energy dependent since @xmath105 .",
    "the imaginary part of the diagonal elements of the self - energy @xmath106 vanishes , so quasiparticles present in the dot can not decay by tunneling into the superconductor . as a result the contribution to the self - energy due to the superconducting lead simply shifts the dot level to the new value @xmath107 .",
    "the divergence of the level energy renormalization with @xmath4 reveals that the process occurs via a virtual state in which a quasiparticle is created in the superconductor . substituting the expression of the qd s green s function in eq.([current4 ] )",
    "we get the result @xmath108 with    @xmath109}\\over { \\left[4 ( \\epsilon-\\epsilon_1)(\\epsilon+\\epsilon_2 )    -\\gamma_{1,{\\rm n}}\\gamma_{2,{\\rm n } }   -\\gamma_{\\rm s}^2(\\epsilon ) \\right]^2 + 4\\left[\\gamma_{1,{\\rm n}}(\\epsilon+\\epsilon_2)+",
    "\\gamma_{2,{\\rm n}}(\\epsilon-\\epsilon_1)\\right]^2 } } \\ ] ]    2 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "notice that the anomalous non - interacting @xmath113 and interacting @xmath114 self - energies exactly cancel in the zero energy limit , resulting in a linear behaviour for energies smaller than the gap@xcite . the spectral function @xmath115 associated with the resonant andreev tunneling is plotted in fig .  [ fig2 ] for various bias voltages .",
    "several features are worth noticing .",
    "first , two peaks at @xmath116 are due to particle and hole bare levels .",
    "note that in the interacting case the bare level energy includes the renormalization due to the superconducting electrode self - energy as discussed above .",
    "second , at low temperatures the spectral function at the fermi energy is completely suppressed , in contrast to what happens in n - qd - n case . quite remarkably , at finite positive ( negative ) voltages a kondo peak develops pinned to the fermi level of the normal metal while a small kink develops at negative ( positive ) voltages . at finite voltages hole and particle energies",
    "differ by @xmath117 , and while the electron ( hole ) is on resonance for positive ( negative ) voltage , the andreev reflected hole ( electron ) is off resonance with respect to the shifted fermi level .",
    "the differential conductance , for various temperatures , is shown in fig .",
    "lowering the temperature a zero - bias anomaly starts to develop where the conductance is strongly suppressed at low voltages . from eqs.([current55]-[conductancebis ] ) we conclude that the linear conductance is roughly proportional to @xmath118 , so that it seems to be completly suppressed in the zero temperature limit .",
    "however , the equation - of - motion approach is quantitatively reliable only above the kondo temperature .",
    "hence the analysis carried out here applies to the regime @xmath119 .",
    "an interesting question to ask is what happens in the opposite regime when the kondo temperature dominates , i.e. , when @xmath120 .",
    "this regime can not be explored by the equation - of - motion approach . for this reason in the next section we will investigate the low temperature regime by means of the slave - boson technique .",
    "in this section we extend the analysis of the previous section to the extreme low temperature regime . to this end",
    "we use slave - boson mean field theory .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the low temperature properties of a kondo impurity in the presence of normal ( barnes 1976 , coleman 1984 , read and newns 1983 , read 1985 ) as well as for superconducting conduction electrons ( borkowski and hirschfeld 1994 ) . despite its simplicity",
    ", this method captures the main physical aspects of the fermi liquid regime at low temperatures , _",
    "i.e. _ , the formation of a many - body resonance at the fermi energy .",
    "for this reason it presents a convenient framework in which to study the interplay between andreev scattering and coulomb interactions .",
    "again we consider an infinite on - site repulsion @xmath6 , so processes where the dot level is doubly occupied are excluded .",
    "the dot level is represented as @xmath121 , where the fermion @xmath122 and the boson @xmath123 describe the singly occupied and empty dot states .",
    "since the dot is either empty or singly occupied , the constraint @xmath124 has to be fulfilled .    in mean field approximation ,",
    "the operator @xmath123 is replaced by a @xmath125-number @xmath126 , and the constraint is fulfilled only on average .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a chemical potential @xmath127 for the pseudo particles .",
    "notice that one ends up with a non - interacting - like problem with renormalized parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , an energy shift for the dot level @xmath128 and a multiplicatively renormalized tunneling amplitude @xmath129 .",
    "we discuss the mean field equations and their solution first in equilibrium and then generalize to non - equilibrium .",
    "we start from the impurity part of the free energy , which in the presence of both normal and superconducting leads is given by @xmath130 + \\lambda_0 b_0 ^ 2 + \\epsilon_{\\rm d } - \\mu   , \\ ] ] where @xmath131 is a fermionic matsubara frequency , @xmath132 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath133 with @xmath134 being the green s function of the lead @xmath135 .    by minimizing the free energy with respect to @xmath127 and @xmath126",

    "@xmath137 is the pseudo fermion green s function given by @xmath138^{-1}$ ] . both in the limit of small and large superconducting gap , we are able to solve the mean field equations analytically as demonstrated here below . the first equation , eq.([sb6 ] ) , is the constraint .",
    "since the pseudo fermion level is at maximum singly occupied , the renormalized level is above the fermi energy . in the kondo limit , where the occupancy is nearly one , we find that @xmath139 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the renormalization of the tunneling amplitude is determined from eq.([sb7 ] ) . a trivial solution @xmath142 always exists .",
    "the solutions which minimize the free energy , however , are those with @xmath143 . by introducing a flat density of states in the leads and the tunneling rates",
    "@xmath144 , the elements of the matrix @xmath145 are @xmath146 and @xmath147 , where @xmath148 restricting ourselves to zero temperature , we replace the matsubara sum in eq.([sb7 ] ) by an integral and obtain @xmath149 where @xmath103 is a cut - off of order the band - width .",
    "we simplify the integral by approximating @xmath150 and @xmath151 as @xmath152 the result is @xmath153 where we neglect a term proportional to @xmath154 , but without any logarithmic factor . if @xmath155 is much smaller than the kondo temperature which is given by @xmath156 , @xmath4 is negligible .",
    "one can then easily solve eq.([ab15 ] ) for @xmath157 and obtain the result for two normal leads with total tunneling rate @xmath158 : @xmath159 in the opposite limit , where @xmath4 is much larger than @xmath160 , we find @xmath161 the results agree qualitatively with what we expect from scaling arguments for the anderson model . in the perturbative regime , a logarithmic correction to @xmath22 has been found ( haldane 1978 ) .",
    "this applies to the case of a large gap , since scaling due to the superconducting electrons stops at energies of the order @xmath4 , giving rise to a logarithmic renormalization of @xmath22 , as seen in eq.([sb18 ] ) . in the case of a small gap",
    ", the superconducting lead contributes to scaling down to low energies , where one enters the strong coupling regime .",
    "presumably , the fixed point is still reached for energies of the order of @xmath160 , much greater than @xmath4 , so that the kondo temperature does not depend on @xmath4 , as indeed found in eq.([sb16 ] ) .",
    "notice that in the presence of normal electrons , we always find a non - trivial solution of the mean field equations .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of superconducting electrons only , @xmath162 , where for large gap only the solution @xmath142 exists , and there is no kondo effect ( borkowski and hirschfeld 1994 ) .    in a non - equilibrium situation , when a voltage is applied between the two leads , the mean field parameters can not be obtained by minimizing the free energy .",
    "however the mean field equations ( [ sb6],[sb7 ] ) can also be derived using a self - consistent diagrammatic method ( millis and lee 1987 ) .",

    "@xmath184 as a function of energy is proportional to @xmath186 near @xmath187 and proportional to @xmath188 near @xmath189 . as a consequence",

    "the success of slave - boson mean field theory stems from the fact that it captures the fermi - liquid regime at low temperature .",

    ", the present mean field approach allows us to estimate the parameters entering eq.([conductance ] ) .",

    "we calculated the current voltage characteristics within the equation - of - motion approach , where we found a suppression of the conductance at low temperature .",

    "therefore we extended the analysis to the extreme low temperature regime using slave boson mean field theory . in the regime when the superconducting gap is smaller than the kondo temperature , we found an enhanced andreev current at low bias voltage due to the kondo effect .",
