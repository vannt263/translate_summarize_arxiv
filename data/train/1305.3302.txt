    "numerical solutions of poisson s equation have been found to be of great importance in various scientific and engineering problems , such as nanodevice design , fluid dynamics , and electrochemistry  @xcite .    in electrostatics , when a simply connected region @xmath1 is occupied by inhomogeneous dielectric materials as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe ] , the corresponding problem is governed by the following equations @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 denote the electric field and the electric flux , respectively , and @xmath5 is the electric charge density . under the assumption of linear , isotropic media ,",
    "the electric flux @xmath4 relates the electric field by @xmath6 where the permittivity @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the permittivity of free space , while the relative permittivity @xmath9 is position dependent generally . by introducing the electrostatic scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) such that @xmath10 , we have poisson s equation as follows @xmath11 the paramount task is to obtain solutions of the above with boundary conditions of corresponding problems .    at the present time , existing numerical methods for poisson s equation are grouped into two categories : direct and iterative solvers . within direct methods , the multifrontal method is one of the most efficient algorithms . in  @xcite , a superfast multifrontal method has been developed to take advantage of hierarchical tree structures of both hierarchically semiseparable ( hss ) matrices and the classical multifrontal idea .",
    "it leads to a total complexity of @xmath12 .",
    "however , @xmath12 is still unacceptable for large problems . as for iterative solvers ,",
    "one competitive method is based on the fast multipole method ( fmm ) integral equation scheme  @xcite . alternatively , the multigrid method  @xcite is the most popular one because it could achieve nearly optimal complexity in theory .",
    "recently , a novel poisson solver has been proposed to solve 2d problems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to traditional poisson solvers , this method solves the electric flux @xmath13 directly .",
    "the electric flux is expressed as the combination of the loop space ( subspace ) ( solenoidal or divergence free ) part and the tree space ( subspace ) ( quasi - irrotational ) part . these two spaces",
    ", however , are non - orthogonal to each other that is dissimilar to the rigorous helmholtz decomposition . by expanding the electric flux density vector @xmath14 ( denoted by electric flux for short throughout ) with two sets of basis functions : loop and tree basis functions ,",
    "the electric flux can be solved by a two - stage process : first , to find the tree - space part , a matrix system is derived based on @xmath15 , and then it is solved by a fast direct tree solver with @xmath16 complexity , where @xmath17 is the total number of tree basis functions .",
    "the obtained electric flux is nonunique since a divergence free component is part of its null space .",
    "second , the loop - space part of @xmath18 is acquired by a projection procedure , which is iterative . once the electric field is obtained , we can readily get the potential distribution by solving @xmath19 by the fast tree solver as well .",
    "this method affords a new way to solve poisson s equation that is faster than the traditional finite element methods ( fem ) .",
    "moreover , almost linear complexity has been observed when stopping criterion is not less than @xmath20 .",
    "however , the solution time could deteriorate as more accurate results are required .    to enhance the efficiency of this method ,",
    "a method based on multilevel analysis of differential operators provides a good option .",
    "one important multilevel approach is the hierarchical linear lagrangian basis ( nodal basis ) method that was proposed by yserentant about two decades ago @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the fem basis is changed from a single - level one to a multilevel basis that spans the same space .",
    "soon afterwards reported an adaptive multilevel fem code @xcite . for this method",
    ", it can achieve the same kind of computational complexity without use of standard multigrid techniques .",
    "this kind of methods are also regarded as hierarchical basis preconditioners ( hbs ) and applications in three dimensions are given in  @xcite . in @xcite , a hierarchical vector - valued basis on triangular mesh has been proposed to solve electric field integral equation ( efie ) with method of moment ( mom ) .",
    "this basis can be further decomposed into solenoidal part and irrotational part ; the solenoidal part comprises hierarchical loop basis that has close relation with hierarchical nodal basis .",
    "another important category of multilevel methods are those based on wavelet theory . in the last few decades , wavelet methods @xcite has been developed as a powerful tool in numerous areas of mathematics , engineering , computer science , statistics , physics , etc . in the early stage , traditional wavelets consist of scaled and shifted versions of a single function on a regularly spaced grid .",
    "sweldens  @xcite break this restriction by proposing lifting scheme , which led to more wider class of second - generation wavelet .",
    "then , the hierarchical loop basis , in view of  @xcite , could be considered as a special kind of wavelet functions .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to extend our previous loop - tree based poisson solver to a multilevel method by using the hierarchical loop basis that has been used for efie before .",
    "it can speed up the iteration process and then reduce the solution time of our poisson solver . as compared with multilevel multigrid method ,",
    "this method is simpler because it is independent of any uniformity restriction on the applied meshes .",
    "in addition , this new method is more friendly to parallel computing since all computations are local .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive the formulation and introduce the relative basis functions and vector space decomposition theorem . in section 3 , we briefly outline the algorithm of previous poisson solver that use normal loop - tree bases .",
    "next , a hierarchical loop basis function is presented in section 4 . finally , in section 5",
    ", we will validate the method and illustrate the efficiency of the new method .",
    "conclusions will be drawn in section 6 .",

    "therefore , it is imperative to find an approach to accelerate convergent procedure . in this section ,",
    "a multilevel method ( also known as multiresolution method ) though hierarchical loop basis will be presented .",
    "first , we introduce a nested mesh scheme , in which several meshes of different granularity are utilized .",
    "the coarsest mesh is generated first .",
    "we label this coarsest mesh with level-@xmath149 mesh associated with triangulation @xmath150 and use @xmath151 to denote the space spanned by nodal basis functions defined on it .",
    "then higher level mesh are subsequently built by subdividing each triangular element of the mesh used in the previous level into four equal - area sub - triangles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nestm ] .",
    "let @xmath150,@xmath152,@xmath153 , ... be the nested triangulations .",

    "furthermore , the method of conjugate gradients needs only @xmath181 computational operations to reduce the energy of the error by a given factor  @xcite . a simple interpretation can account for this improvement : since the differential equation operator gives rise to a sparse matrix system which corresponds to near - neighbor interactions , each matrix - vector product will send the information @xmath182 grid points away ; therefore , it takes @xmath183 steps to send the information completely through the simulation region in 2d problems @xcite ; this situation is changed by introducing the hierarchical loop basis , where large loop functions as well as small ones co - exist ; as a result , information can traverse the simulation domain quickly .",
