    ". the longer periods ( lp ) in the imply the presence of excited high radial order gravity modes ( g - modes ) , in contrast to the pressure modes ( p - modes ) present in the v361  hya stars . the driving mechanism for these new pulsators is under discussion .",

    "constructing pulsation models based on such physical insights is a necessary prerequisite to interpret asteroseismological observations .",

    "in follow - up observations of hot subdwarfs from the hamburg quasar survey , the m@xmath615 object hs0702 + 6043 was discovered as a new v361  hya star by .",
    "the main pulsation period was 363s at a relatively large amplitude of 29mmag .",

    "the atmospheric parameters derived by quantitative model atmosphere analysis , @xmath728400k and @xmath85.35 , make it one of the coolest v361  hya stars known . with refined time series analysis tools , we recently discovered in the original data set that hs0702@xmath06043 shows long period variations of about 1h ( at a much lower amplitude ) along with the short period oscillations .",
    "the initial discovery was confirmed by observations with the 2.3 m steward telescope atop kitt peak in february 2004 .",
    "table  [ tab : schuh1 ] lists the photometric observations available for hs0702@xmath06043 so far .",

    "a third period of about 1h started to emerge ( fig.[fig : schuh2 ] ) , which prompted us to initiate follow - up observations .",
    "the data obtained in tbingen allow to recover the strongest mode at 363s only .",
    "as the telescope is located inside the city limits of tbingen , we regard this detection as a success . of course",
    ", the nearly noise - free steward data are much better suited for our aim .",
    "the two consecutive nights not only allow to extract the two short periods previously published but also one mean long period ( table  [ tab : schuh2 ] ) .",
    "in addition they indicate a more complicated structure of the low - frequency variation ( fig.[fig : schuh3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the existence of the long period is clearly confirmed ; it is still present four years after the first observation .",
    "it can be detected in both nights of the new data set already in the frequency spectrum of the full light curve without prewhitening .",
    "we show the spectrum of the first night in fig.[fig : schuh2 ] .",
    "after prewhitening of the three periods listed in table  [ tab : schuh2 ] , there are still significant residual amplitudes , implying the presence of more than one period in the low - frequency range ( again , this is true for both nights ) .",
    "this finding strongly argues for a pulsational character of the new low - amplitude variation .",
    "it also supports the view that the new frequency is not simply a higher - order combination frequency as might be inferred from table  [ tab : schuh2 ] due to the consistency of the difference within the errors , but rather corresponds to an independent mode .",

    "both the relative shortness of an hypothetical orbital or rotational period as well as the multi - mode character of the photometric variation make a successful explanation through binary or rotational motion highly unlikely . on the other hand , it is known that g - mode pulsators with similar periods and amplitudes exist among sdbs with parameters close to those found for hs0702@xmath06043 : its effective temperature places it at the cool end of the p - mode , and hence at the same time close to the hot end of the g - mode , empirically determined instability regions .",
    "this strongly suggests that p - mode and high - order g - mode pulsations coexist in this star , indicating that the instability strip for stars might overlap with that for v361  hya stars .",
    "whether or not the instability strips for and v361  hya stars overlap is an important question . in fig.[fig : schuh4 ] we plot the published atmospheric parameters of 27 v361  hya stars and 6 lpsdbvs @xcite indicating that the two instability regions do indeed touch .",
    "however , a homogenous set of accurate atmospheric parameters is still needed . in a first attempt , which in particular includes more lpsdbv stars , spectroscopic work by two of us ( e.m.g .  and g.f .",
    ", see fig.[fig : schuh4 ] ) has homogenized the parameter determination to obtain comparable temperatures and gravities .",
    "this analysis yields spectroscopic parameters of @xmath729500k and @xmath85.44 for hs0702@xmath06043 that differ from the earlier results . despite systematic shifts introduced by neglecting metal - line blanketing effects",
    ", the relative position of hs0702@xmath06043 confirmes the conclusion that the two instability regions touch .",
    "this position makes hs0702@xmath06043 a key object in ( not only sdb ) asteroseismology since simultaneous p- and g - mode pulsations sample different parts of a star .",
    "@xcite suggested that the sdbv / lpsdbv have a main sequence analogy in the @xmath15  cep/[spb ] variables . in this context , it is interesting to note that , according to @xcite , the @xmath16  cep star @xmath17  eri might also show an [ spb]-like frequency .",
    "similarly , @xcite have reported a possibly @xmath18  sct - like frequency in the @xmath19  dor object hd  209295 . with hs0702@xmath06043 belonging to both sdbv classes , it challenges theory s description of stability and driving mechanisms in current pulsational models .",
    "we have constructed a preliminary stellar structure pulsational model for hs0702@xmath06042 where both short - period , low - order p - modes and long - period , high - order g - modes can be excited .",
    "this is in good qualitative agreement with what we observe in hs0702@xmath06043 , but the effective temperature of that model is somewhat lower than desirable .",
    "alternatively , we propose that those g - modes whose frequencies happen to fall close to nonlinear peaks from p - modes ( combination frequencies ) could be excited through resonance coupling . when the star is  hit  at a frequency @xmath20 at relatively large amplitudes , g - modes which happen to have very similar frequencies ( if they exist ) , and which are normally stable , would then be driven to observable amplitude because they resonate with the  engine  that hits them .",
    "this would also imply that the low - frequency peaks are real g - modes excited through resonance at those frequencies and not merely nonlinear features .",
    "we report the recent discovery of a new period in the sdb star hs0702@xmath06043 already known as a v361  hya variable .",
    "the additional detection is a low - amplitude , long - period light variation that is most probably due to independent pulsations .",
    "the interpretation as a member of the recently discovered class of g - mode pulsators among sdb stars makes this variable the first recognized to show both of the known types of pulsational variations for sdbs .",
    "the current light curves prove that beyond the one g - mode type period confirmed so far , there is residual power in the low - frequency regime , suggesting a more complicated structure .",
    "we plan to obtain a good frequency spectrum from a longer light curve to further investigate the g - modes , and adequately resolve the low - frequency spectral structure .",
    "there are clues that hs0702@xmath06043 might in fact represent the prototype of a whole new class of similar objects : rumours at this conference suggest that the interesting behaviour observed in hs0702@xmath06043 may also have been uncovered in other v361  hya stars , but this remains to be confirmed ."
