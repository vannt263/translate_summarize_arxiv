    "since the early days of nuclear physics , transfer reactions have been a preferred tool to study spectroscopic properties of nuclei and have been widely used to determine single particle structure across the nuclear chart ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such studies have allowed a better understanding of detailed features of nuclear interactions .",
    "it was through a systematic study of single nucleon transfer on sn isotopes , that we now understand the reduction of the spin - orbit strength when moving toward neutron rich systems @xcite .",
    "one would also like to use the transfer reaction method to discriminate between effective interactions used in the shell model , as suggested in the study of ( d , p ) on ni isotopes @xcite . nowadays",
    "the spectroscopy of exotic nuclei can be studied using inverse kinematics .",
    "pioneering studies @xcite hold promise for applying this technique more broadly , especially in new generation rare isotope facilities , where beam rates will be enhanced .",
    "another intriguing aspect of nuclear structure is the role of correlations .",
    "the independent particle shell model of course neglects all correlations .",
    "state - of - the - art shell model include some correlations effectively through the residual interactions .",
    "electron knockout experiments have shown a 30% decrease in the spectroscopic factors of closed shell nuclei as compared to the independent shell model predictions , a reduction that is understood in terms of short range correlations @xcite .",
    "reduction factors from nuclear knockout experiments can be much larger , depending on the difference between the neutron and proton separation energies @xcite",
    ". however , the physical reason for such a large suppression is still unclear , long range correlations being a possibility @xcite .",
    "what is most intriguing is that spectroscopic factors from transfer reactions show no dependence on the difference in neutron - proton separation energies .",
    "large surveys of ground state spectroscopic factors from ( d , p ) reactions @xcite , including nuclei with a wide range of separation energies ( 0.5 - 19 mev ) show good agreement with large scale shell model using modern effective interactions .",
    "the reconciliation of these results with those from knockout experiments@xcite is proving difficult and is the subject of recent work on new approaches to the calculation of overlap functions@xcite .",
    "the resolution of these important physics questions relies on the accuracy of the reaction model being used .",
    "it is thus of paramount importance that the reaction theory is well founded and uncertainties are well understood . in this respect",
    "there have been a number of works looking at specific aspects of the reactions theory used for the analysis of ( d , p ) transfer data ( uncertainties in the optical potentials @xcite , coupling to excited states of the target @xcite and ambiguities due to the single particle wave functions @xcite and new ways of calculating overlap functions @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we explore another aspect : the consequences of the non - zero range of the @xmath0 interaction that plays a key role in the theory is several different ways .    over the past four decades of work on ( d , p ) reactions ,",
    "different approximations were made , not only regarding the optical potentials , the deuteron and final single - particle wavefunctions , but also in the reaction mechanism and the evaluation of the transfer matrix element .",
    "it may thus be confusing to realize the large range of spectroscopic factors available in the literature .",
    "systematic and consistent studies @xcite provide a much better overall assessment of the situation . in @xcite an extensive survey of ground state spectroscopic factors from charge @xmath1 was performed using the same reaction model , the same global potentials and the same single particle parameters . with these same assumptions , spectroscopic factors extracted from 235 sets of ( d , p ) data were found consistent with shell model predictions to within @xmath2% .",
    "an identical study was performed on excited states @xcite , and although there were a few unresolved cases ( such as the ni isotopes ) , the overall agreement with shell model was of the order of @xmath3% .",
    "ni isotopes were studied separately @xcite and a better overall description of these nuclei was found with a modified effective interaction in the shell - model calculations .",
    "all these studies rely on the adiabatic distorted - wave approximation ( adwa ) developed by johnson and soper @xcite and the local energy approximation ( lea ) @xcite to take into account the finite range of the @xmath0 interaction @xmath4 in evaluating the @xmath5 transition matrix .    in @xcite , a three - body theory for a(d",
    ", p)b was developed taking into account deuteron breakup which is known to be important even for reactions on stable nuclei . in @xcite",
    "the zero range approximation is made for the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "then , the transfer matrix element reduces to a form similar to the zero range distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) where the scattering wavefunction in the incident channel is calculated with an adiabatic potential consisting of the sum of the proton and neutron potentials evaluated at half the deuteron energy , instead of the deuteron optical potential extracted from ( d , d ) data .",
    "adwa typically decreases the radius and diffuseness of the distorting potential @xcite compared with typical values for deuteron optical potentials deduced from elastic deuteron scattering and often provides a better description of the data @xcite .    an adiabatic theory including finite range effects was formally developed by johnson and tandy @xcite .",
    "using a weinberg expansion in the deuteron channel , johnson and tandy arrive at a set of coupled channel equations to describe the relative motion of the centre of mass of the neutron and proton relative to the target .",
    "the solution of the coupled channels equations gives a three - body wavefunction that is a coherent superposition of the bound ( deuteron ) and break - up continuum states of the @xmath0 system .    in this paper",
    "we will confine ourselves to the simplest version of this theory in which only the first term in the weinberg expansion is retained .",
    "this assumes that the only significant break - up components in the three - body wavefunction have sufficiently small energies that _ inside the range of _ @xmath4",
    ", the relevant @xmath0 scattering states have the same radial shape as the deuteron ground state wave function .",
    "when only the first weinberg term is included , the coupled equations reduce to an optical - model - like equation for the three - body wavefunction where the distorting potential is the sum of the neutron and proton optical potentials multiplied by the neutron - proton interaction , folded over the deuteron bound state.the effect of other components @xcite have been shown to be significant at @xmath6 mev but their effects at lower energies are unknown .    in the early sixties",
    ", it was already understood that finite range effects were important in ( d , p ) reactions , however due to computational limitations , all calculations were performed in zero range .",
    "a very popular procedure to correct a zero range calculation was developed by buttle and goldfarb @xcite .",
    "the standard implementation of this method , the so - called local energy approximation ( lea ) , takes only the first term of the expansion presented in @xcite . for deuteron energies well above the coulomb barrier ,",
    "it is not clear that this procedure is sufficiently accurate .",
    "a simple estimate of the modification of the johnson and soper potential due to a finite range @xmath4 were reported in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we perform a systematic study of finite range effects in ( d , p ) reactions within the framework of adwa .",
    "we consider 26 ( d , p ) reactions on stable targets , involving nuclei with masses ranging @xmath7 and deuteron energies @xmath8 mev .",
    "we first study the finite range effects on the distorting potential potential in the incident channel following the method by johnson and tandy @xcite .",
    "in addition , we consider finite range effects in the evaluation of the transfer matrix element and the accuracy of the lea . we also explore the implications of our study to reactions involving loosely bound nuclei .    the paper is organized in the following way : reaction theory is revised in sec .",
    "ii , results are presented in sec .",
    "iii and further discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in sec . v.",
    "our starting point is a three - body model of the @xmath9 system , see @xcite , ch.7 . in this model",
    "the scattering wavefunction @xmath10 corresponding to a deuteron incident on a nucleus @xmath11 is the solution of the inhomogeneous differential equation @xmath12 \\psi^{(+)}(\\vec r,\\vec r ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\imath \\epsilon \\phi_{d}(\\vec r)\\exp(\\imath \\vec k_d .\\vec r ) .",
    "\\label{3b - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the total kinetic energy operators associated with the n - p relative motion and the motion of the @xmath15 centre of mass relative to the target , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we take @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be the neutron and proton coordinates relative to the center of mass of the target @xmath11 .    in eq.([3b - eq ] ) the interactions @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the neutron - target , proton - target and neutron - proton interactions , respectively . the term",
    "proportional to @xmath23 on the r.h.s . of eq.([3b - eq ] ) ensures that there is an incoming wave only in the deuteron channel .",
    "one way of calculating the exact ( d , p ) transition amplitude , @xmath24 , from @xmath10 is to use the formulation of timofeyuk and johnson@xcite . in the limit @xmath25 , the transition amplitude @xmath24 is given by : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the final state of the neutron - target system , and @xmath28 has a plane wave proton and an incoming scattered wave distorted by @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that in this formulation there is no remnant term and the proton distorted wave is generated by @xmath29 _ not _ @xmath30 .",
    "eq.([texact - eq ] ) neglects recoil effects of order @xmath31 which were evaluated in @xcite .",
    "they are negligible in all the cases discussed here except possibly for @xmath32c .",
    "the connection between this formulation and standard 3-body methods based on the faddeev equations @xcite is explained in@xcite .",
    "a more common expression for the transition amplitude for this process is : @xmath33 where @xmath27 is the final state of the neutron - target system , and @xmath34 is a proton scattering wave distorted by @xmath30 . in the many - body generalisation of eq.([t - eq ] ) the remnant term @xmath35 is a function of the internal coordinates of @xmath11 and @xmath36 and makes the interpretation of the transition amplitude in terms of nuclear structure ( overlap functions ) much more complicated than when eq.([tjt - eq ] ) is used .",
    "this introduces into the formulation an additional optical potential @xmath37 and thus larger uncertainties into the analysis since in most applications to exotic nuclei this potential is not well determined .",
    "many of the recent applications have used eq.([t - eq ] ) and neglected the remnant term @xmath35 : @xmath38 neglecting the remnant term is a very good approximation for all cases discussed here with the exception of @xmath32c .",
    "eq.([texact - eq ] ) is the starting point for the present study .",
    "the important realization in @xcite is that with eq.([tjt - eq ] ) or eq.([texact - eq ] ) , the full three - body wavefunction @xmath10 is only required within the range of the @xmath4 interaction .",
    "a major simplification is achieved in the limit of the zero - range approximation as then only @xmath39 is needed .",
    "the method developed by johnson and soper @xcite is based on an expansion of the three - body wavefunction @xmath10 in the complete set of eigenstates of the @xmath0 hamiltonian : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the deuteron wave function while scattering states are represented by @xmath42 .",
    "the three - body wavefunction is then expanded as : @xmath43 when this expansion is introduced in eq.([3b - eq ] ) , and assuming that the excitation energies of the deuteron are small compared to the deuteron initial kinetic energy @xmath44 , the three - body equation for @xmath45 reduces to an optical model equation : @xmath46 where the effective potential @xmath47 does not describe deuteron elastic scattering , but rather incorporates deuteron breakup effects within the range of @xmath4 : @xmath48 within this model , the transfer amplitude reduces to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the zero range constant of the deuteron .",
    "the johnson and tandy @xcite approach again builds on the fact that the three - body wavefunction is only needed within the range of @xmath4 .",
    "while the continuum discretized coupled channel method ( cdcc ) @xcite uses a basis of eigenstates of the @xmath0 hamiltonian which is complete for all values of the @xmath0 separation @xmath51 , as in eq.([phid - eq ] ) , here the weinberg basis is introduced : @xmath52 with @xmath53 and the orthonormality relation @xmath54 .",
    "the weinberg states ( or sturmians ) form a complete basis within the range of the @xmath4 interaction and thus they are particularly suited to describing the problem when using the transfer amplitude written as in eq.([texact - eq ] ) . a clear advantage of this basis as compared to eq.([phid - eq ] ) is that it is square integrable .",
    "the three - body wavefunction is then expanded as : @xmath55 when this expansion is introduced into the three - body equation eq.([3b - eq ] ) , one obtains a set of coupled channel equations : @xmath56 \\chi_i(\\vec r ) = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\imath \\epsilon \\delta_{i1 } n_d \\exp(\\imath \\vec k_d .\\vec r ) + \\sum_{j \\ne i } \\bar u_{ij } ( \\vec r ) \\chi_{j}(\\vec r ) .",

    "the normalization coefficient appearing on the r.h.s of eq.([jt1-eq ] ) is @xmath61 .",
    "these coupled channel equations can be solved exactly as done in @xcite but reduce to a much simpler form if only the first term of the expansion eq.([weinberg2 ] ) is necessary . in that case ,",
    "@xmath62 and we can arrive at the following optical model type equation : @xmath63 where now the potential is still related to the sum of the proton and neutron potentials as in johnson and soper , but involves a more complex folding procedure : @xmath64 apart from the normalization , @xmath65 is the ground state wavefunction of the deuteron @xmath66 .",
    "then the potential @xmath67 can also be written in terms of @xmath66 : @xmath68    in this case the transfer amplitude is defined through the 6-dimensional integral : @xmath69 where we have used @xmath70 .",
    "we see from eq.([jt2-eq ] ) that @xmath71 is a distorted wave generated by the potential @xmath72 and normalized to an incident wave of unit amplitude .    in the following section we will compare the cross sections obtained with eq.([tmatrix - zr ] ) and eq.([tmatrix - fr ] ) .",
    "we also disentangle the separate effects of finite range in the potential @xmath72 , looking specifically at the potentials from eq.([jspot - eq ] ) and ( [ jtpot - eq ] ) , and that of finite range in the evaluation of the transfer amplitude .",
    "we perform a systematic study of finite range effects on 26 ( d , p ) reactions . in all our calculations",
    "we take the reid interaction for the deuteron @xcite and the chapel hill global parameterization for the nucleon optical potentials @xcite . in calculating the potential of eq.[jtpot2-eq ]",
    "we neglect the d - wave part of the @xmath66 . for all cases here",
    "presented , the final bound single particle state is obtained using a potential with standard radius and diffuseness @xmath73 fm and @xmath74 fm and adjusting the depth to the known neutron separation energy of the corresponding final state . in subsection(iiia ) we show our results for the potential and then present the results for the ( d , p ) cross sections in subsection(iiib ) .",
    "johnson and tandy potentials eq.([jtpot2-eq ] ) are computed , using a subroutine contained in the code twofnr @xcite for performing the @xmath75 integrations needed , and compared with the johnson and soper adiabatic potentials eq.([jspot - eq ] ) for 26 cases . in order to simplify the comparison we fit the real part of the resulting @xmath76 to a volume woods saxon shape and the corresponding imaginary to a surface woods saxon form . for all cases",
    "studied we find that the most important difference between the interactions @xmath76 and @xmath47 is a constant increase in diffuseness .",

    "it is the finite range in the adiabatic potential that is the dominant cause for these large changes although the finite - range effect in the evaluation of the t - matrix is still important and should not be neglected .",
    "in addition , for these higher energies , we find that the lea method breaks down and for the heavier systems this approximation can in fact provide a correction in the opposite direction to the full finite range calculation .    because it is the adiabatic scattering wavefunction that is mostly responsible for the large differences , we investigated the radial behavior of the scattering wavefunctions using either @xmath76 or @xmath47 for the partial waves which contribute the most to the transfer cross section .",
    "we specifically looked at the properties of the integrand of eq.([tmatrix - fr ] ) in the zero - range approximation where it has a simpler form .",
    "we found that the percentage difference comes from subtle cancellations and can not be well illustrated in the partial wave expansion .",
    "intuitively one might argue that since the energies are larger , the dominant contribution to the transfer cross section comes from smaller impact parameters and thus sensitivity to the range of @xmath4 should be larger .     +   +    to ensure that our results are general , in particular that they will still be applicable to reactions in which the final bound state has a large spatial extension , we performed additional calculations for a fictitious @xmath85ca(d , p)@xmath86ca setting the valence neutron angular momentum in the final bound state to @xmath107 state , and varying the binding energy @xmath108 mev .",
    "the overall findings did not change : regardless of the loosely bound nature of the final nucleus , or the angular momentum in the final bound state , the effects of finite range in the transfer cross section are modest for low energies and become very important for the higher energies .",
    "the overall features obtained in this work can be best summarized in fig.[systematic - fig ] where the two separate effects of finite range are plotted as a function of beam energy for ( d , p ) reaction on four different targets : solid symbols provide the percentage effect of including finite range in the evaluation of the matrix element relative to a zero - range @xmath24-matrix calculation with a johnson and soper potential in both cases , and the open symbols correspond to the effect of including finite range effects in the distorting potential in the incident channel wave .",
    "the figure summarizes the results already given in table [ fr - effects ] . from this figure",
    "we can see that at low energy , finite range results differ by less than 10% from zero range matrix element with a johnson and soper adiabatic potential .",
    "however , as the incoming deuteron energy increases , finite range effects become very important and can dominate the result .",
    "the energy at which the transition occurs depends non linearly on the charge and the mass of the system . for practical purposes we find the transition to be around 20 mev / u for lighter systems and 30 mev / u for the heavy systems .     +    to facilitate the practical analysis of experiments , we searched for a global correction factor , a factor that would estimate the finite range effect as a function of target charge , mass and beam energy .",
    "although for a given target one could always find a function @xmath109 representing the finite - range correction , no consistent dependence in mass and charge was found for the parameters of the various fits .",
    "it is important to remember that the exact inclusion of deuteron finite range effects requires the solution of a couple channel equations eq.([jt1-eq ] ) and here we truncated the weinberg expansion to the first term to simplify the problem .",
    "the full equations were solved in @xcite for @xmath110zn .",
    "it would be interesting to extend this study to better determine the range of validity of the truncation here used .",
    "we perform a systematic study of the effects of deuteron finite range in ( d , p ) reactions , within a formalism that includes the coherent effects of deuteron breakup through an adiabatic potential in the incident channel .",
    "we use the adiabatic formalism developed by johnson and soper @xcite in zero range and compare with the finite range generalization of tandy and johnson @xcite .",
    "we analyze separately the effects of finite - range in the adiabatic distorting potential and finite range in the evaluation of the transfer matrix element .",
    "we also test the local energy approximation which is widely used as an estimate of finite range corrections to zero range transfer cross sections .",
    "we performed ( d , p ) calculations to determine angular distributions for a wide range of beam energies as well as a variety of targets , from a=12 to a=208 .    for sub - coulomb reactions ,",
    "the percentage difference between the finite range and the zero range cross sections at the peak of the angular distribution relative to the zero range johnson and soper prediction is within 10% for all cases studied , and the local energy approximation provides an estimate within a few percent of the full finite range calculation .",
    "however , as the beam energy increases , finite range effects become more important . for intermediate energies ( @xmath111 mev / u for @xmath112 and @xmath113 mev / u for heavier nuclei ) ,",
    "including the finite range of the @xmath0 interaction in the adiabatic scattered wavefunction reduces the cross section while including finite range in the evaluation of the transfer amplitude increases the cross section .",
    "both effects are significant , although strong cancellations may occur . at higher energies ,",
    "both finite range effects have the same sign , reducing the transfer cross section . in this case",
    "we find the total effect of finite range to be very important .",
    "our results also suggest that at these higher energies , the local energy approximation is no longer adequate .",
