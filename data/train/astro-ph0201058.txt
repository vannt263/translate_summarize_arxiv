    "the greater amount of baryonic matter is predicted to lie in , as yet unvirialized , matter in the form of a tenuous warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim , hellsten et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the detection and study of these components is needed for the proper understanding of large and small scale structures in the universe . however , while x - ray emission from the virialized density peaks of the icm and ism has been detected and intensively studied in x - rays , the predicted highly ionized gas in the whim has been poorly studied so far , due to instrumental limitations .",
    "the low density of the whim leads to low emissivity , so that studies of the whim in emission are a formidable challenge .",
    "however , absorption depends only on the total column density of the medium , not on density , and background light sources in the form of quasars ( aldcroft et al . , 1994 ) and gamma - ray bursts ( fiore et al . 2000 )",
    "are readily available .",
    "a few high ionization transitions , notably ovi @xmath201031.93 , lie in the uv , but the most prominent ions ( cvi , ovii , oviii , neix ) have their strongest transitions in the soft x - ray band ( 10 - 40  ) for a wide range of temperatures ( @xmath21 k , nicastro et al . , 1999 ) , which should give rise to an `` x - ray forest '' of absorption lines ( e.g. perna & loeb , 1998 , fang & canizares , 2000 ) .",

    "the spectral resolution of the hrcs - letg ( r@xmath27 , fwhm @xmath28 660 km s@xmath8 at 20  ) does not resolve the high ionization x - ray absorption lines ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of the fuse spectrometer ( @xmath54 , fwhm @xmath28 20 km s@xmath8 at @xmath55  ) is more than one order of magnitude larger than that of the _ chandra _ hrcs - letg , and is sufficient to resolve the ovi@xmath56 absorption into at least two components ( figure 3a ; table 1 ) .",

    "we also note that both position and width of the oi@xmath32(@xmath33 ) absorption line in the fuse spectrum , are clearly different from widths and positions of each of the two ovi components in the same spectrum ( fig .",

    "3f , c , table 1 ) .",
    "we then conclude that : ( a ) the high ionization lines , both in the uv and x - rays are likely to be produced by gas with similar dynamical properties , and broad range of dispersion velocities ( from the uv profile ) , while ( b ) the low ionization atomic oi lines ( both in fuse and _ chandra _ ) are produced by a slow - moving cloud of cold gas , with relatively low internal dispersion velocity , and so differs dramatically in both physical and dynamical properties from the high ionization gas .    in the following",
    "we discuss only the highly ionized component .",
    "absorption lines equivalent widths ( ews ) , and their ratios , can in principle provide invaluable information on the physical state of the gas , and allow one to distinguish between quite different scenarios .",
    "however these diagnostics can only be applied to unsaturated lines .",
    "fortunately the uv ovi@xmath47 lines are clearly not saturated , since the ratio between the ews of the doublet ( @xmath59 and @xmath60  ) , is fully consistent with the oscillator strengths ( oss ) ratio of 2 ( savage et al . , 2000 ) . for the x - ray lines of ovii , oviii and neix , in principle",
    ", one could compare the ews of the corresponding k@xmath38 and k@xmath61 lines .",
    "however , the errors on the ews of the k@xmath61 lines from these ions are too large .",
    "an alternative approach uses the curve of growth ( cog ; e.g. spitzer , 1978 ) , computed for a given doppler parameter , to see whether each line falls on the linear branch of the cog .",
    "we ran our model for resonant absorption ( nicastro , fiore and matt , 1999 ) to produce cogs for the ovi@xmath31 , the ovii@xmath4 , the oviii@xmath4 doublet , and the neix@xmath4 .",
    "we assume a doppler parameter of b=200 km s@xmath8 , since this is the observed @xmath3 of the ovi@xmath47 complex .",
    "the cogs are plotted in figure 4 , along with the maximum possible measured ews ( best fit + 2@xmath3 ) of each line ( ews are plotted in absolute value ) . for the ovi@xmath31 complex we considered the total ew from the two best fit gaussians .",
    "all the lines ews fall well within the linear branches of their cogs .",
    "hence the lines are not saturated , and the resulting column densities , listed in table  1 , should be reliable . .",
    "the fuse and _ chandra _ spectra of pks  2155 - 304 contain absorption features from local intervening ionized gas that span a broad ionization interval , from neutral ( oi ) , through mildly ionized ( ovi , ovii ) , to highly ionized ( ovii , oviii and neix ) .",
    "the neutral and the ionized components have very different dynamical and physical properties and so must belong to two different , spatially separated , systems .",
    "the profile of the ovi complex in the fuse spectrum suggests that the ionized component is also made up of at least two different absorbers : one slow - moving , with relatively low internal dispersion velocity and possibly associated with a cloud in the galactic disk , and one moving towards us with a velocity of about 150 km s@xmath8 ( @xmath62 km s@xmath8 transforming from the heliocentric to the galactic standard of rest frame ) and with a similar internal dispersion velocity and possibly associated either with an ionized high velocity cloud in the galactic halo , or with a whim filament .    in the next sections we demonstrate that neither pure collisional ionization nor pure photoionization models can account for the presence of strong ovii and neix absorption with the observed intensity of the ovi lines , unless the three absorbers ( one x - ray and the two uv ) are associated with three different galactic clouds with drastically different equilibrium conditions ( with temperatures differing by an order of magnitude ) , and so locations .",
    "alternatively we show that if there is one highly tenuous absorber , then the photoionization contribution by the diffuse x - ray background becomes important and can change the internal ion abundance distribution to account for all the uv and x - ray observational constraints in a single absorbing medium .",
    "these solutions however , imply path lengths of the order of several mpc , and so definitively locate the uv - x - ray absorber in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , beyond our galaxy on a scale of the local group , or somewhat bigger .      for the photoionization contribution by the diffuse , extragalactic x - ray background , we adopt an euv to @xmath63-ray spectral energy distribution [ i.e. the specific flux @xmath64 given by a broken power law with an exponential high energy cutoff ( i.e. @xmath65 e^{-(e / e_f)}$ ] , with @xmath66 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 kev , and @xmath73 kev ; we also adopt a low energy cutoff at energies lower than the hydrogen ionization threshold @xmath74 ) .",

    "@xmath130 , is simply the ratio between the number density of ionizing photons and the electron density of the gas , @xmath130 increases as either the electron density in the gas decreases ( as in the igm case ) or the distance between the source of ionizing photons and the gas cloud decreases .",
    "so high values of u might also be reached in gas with typical ism densities ( i.e. @xmath131 @xmath80 ) illuminated by other , discrete and locally much brighter hard x - ray sources than the xrb . in this section",
    "we explore this second possibility .",
    "based on the needed value of @xmath129 we can put constraints on the brightness of the ionizing source as seen by us , and on the angular separation between the source and the gas cloud .",
    "let us consider an intervening cloud of gas located at a distance @xmath132 from us , along a given line of sight , and an ionizing source , located at a distance @xmath133 from us .",
    "let @xmath134 be the distance between the ionizing source and the gas cloud .",
    "we can write : ( a ) @xmath135 ; ( b ) @xmath136 ; and ( c ) @xmath137 . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath138 is the source luminosity , and @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the source fluxes as seen by us and the gas cloud respectively . these two fluxes are related to each other through the source - gas angular separation @xmath141 : @xmath142 .",
    "the ionization parameter u at the illuminated face of the cloud can then be written as a function of the source flux as seen by us : @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the total flux of ionizing photons ( @xmath145 ) . to maximize the contribution from hard x - ray ionizing photons we use as the ionizing continuum a cutoff power law with @xmath146 from the h ionization threshold up to 100 kev , and @xmath147 from 100 kev up to infinity .",
    "this gives a total flux of ionizing photons of @xmath148 ph s@xmath8 ( where @xmath149 is the observed flux between 2 and 10 kev , and we assumed @xmath150 ) .",
    "our value @xmath129 then gives : @xmath151 .",
    "for @xmath152 arcmin and gas densities in the ism range @xmath153 @xmath80 , then , the 2 - 10 kev observed flux must be as large as @xmath154 erg s@xmath8 @xmath25 ( @xmath155 crab ) , to efficiently ionize the gas . for a 30 times smaller separation , this fluxes reduce to @xmath156 erg s@xmath8 @xmath25 ( @xmath157 crab ) .",
    "no such source is currently seen .    for halo distances of 30",
    "kpc the implied 2 - 10 kev luminosities are @xmath158 erg s@xmath8 ( @xmath159 pc ) , far too large for any known stellar - size galactic source , and @xmath160 erg s@xmath8 ( @xmath161 pc ) , just about the maximum observed luminosity for the most luminous known ultra - luminous - x - ray sources ( ulxs ) or beamed microquasars . for the much closer distances of galactic disk objects , say , 10 pc , these luminosities reduce to more normal values for x - ray binaries ( i.e. @xmath162 erg s@xmath8 , and @xmath163 erg s@xmath8 ) but the physical separations between the source and the gas cloud become very small : @xmath164 pc and @xmath165 pc respectively .",
    "so , either very luminous sources , or very close source - to - gas systems are needed to efficently ionize a tenuous gas cloud in our galaxy to the observed degree .",
    "we searched the rosat - wgacat ( white , giommi , & angelini , 1994 ) for bright x - ray sources in a 30 arcmin radius cylinder , centered on the line of sight to pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "we found 33 unidentified sources plus an f0 star with rosat - pspc count rates between 0.0019 and 0.024 ct s@xmath8 , and angular distances from the line of sight from @xmath166 to @xmath167 arcmin .",
    "the closest of these sources to the pks  2155 - 304 line of sight has a count rate of 0.0073 ( source a : 1wga  j2158.8 - 3011 ) , while the brightest ( 0.025 ct s@xmath8 ) is at a distance of 15.1 arcmin ( source b : 1wga  j2158.2 - 3000 ) .",
    "we used pimms to convert these count rates , into flux . to maximize the possible contribution at energies",
    "e@xmath168 kev , we assumed a hard x - ray continuum ( a powerlaw with @xmath146 ) heavily absorbed by a column of @xmath169 @xmath25 intrinsic neutral gas .",
    "this gave 2 - 10 kev fluxes of @xmath170 erg s@xmath8 @xmath25 ( @xmath171 crab ) , for source a , and @xmath172 erg s@xmath8 @xmath25 ( @xmath173 crab ) for source b , at least ( i.e. using @xmath174 @xmath80 ) 4 and 5 orders of magnitude , respectively , lower than the values required to photoionize the gas at these angular separations .",
    "let us consider a microquasar highly beamed into the direction of the gas cloud , and whose line of sight to us is somewhat perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the probability for a microquasar to be beamed in the direction of the gas cloud , and located within a 20 - 130 pc radius sphere from the gas cloud , depends on the distribution of the parent poulation , that , for microquasars , is largely unknown .",
    "we can compute here the minimum beaming factor needed , in the above optimal geometrical configuration , for source a or b to efficiently ionize a cloud of gas along the line os sight to pks  2155 - 304 . the luminosity amplification due to beaming , in the direction of the jet ,",
    "is given by : @xmath175 .",
    "the observed luminosity along a perpendicular direction is insted de - boosted by the factor : @xmath176 ( urry & shafer , 1984 ) . in the above equations , @xmath177 is the source intrinsic luminosity , @xmath63 is the lorentzian factor , and @xmath178 ( urry & shafer , 1984 ) . solving for the intrinsic luminosity , and using as maximum value for the beamed luminosity of a microquasar @xmath179 erg s@xmath8 and the observed value of @xmath180 erg s@xmath8 ( for source b , at 30 kpc ) ,",
    "we obtain a minimum relativistic factor of @xmath181 , to compare with the estimated upper limit of @xmath182 for the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez , 1999 ) . any deviation from the above ideal geometry , would give a much larger lorentz factor .",
    "low density gas has long recombination times .",
    "a source may thus have been much more luminous in the past and ionized the gas then , from which the gas has not yet recovered .",
    "let us first suppose that the most luminous x - ray source we are currently seeing in the rosat archive is a binary system that went through a ulx phase ( king et al . , 2001 ) in the past ( from the calculation in  4.5.1 , for source a and b we need l(outburst)/l(now)@xmath183 , respectively ) .",
    "the recombination time for the ovii - oviii ions , in gas with electron density of @xmath90 @xmath80 is of about @xmath184 years ( nicastro et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "typical ulx phases are thought to last for @xmath185 years , and in our galaxy the total estimated rate of ulxs is of 1 every @xmath186 years ( king et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "so , allowing for a maximum delay of @xmath187 years , we may expect n = 2 ulxs in all the galaxy over a period of @xmath188 years . assuming , for the halo , a 30 kpc radius sphere ,",
    "this gives a ulx density , over the same period , of n = @xmath189 kpc@xmath190 .",
    "so , the maximum number of ulxs expected over a period @xmath191 in a random @xmath192 pc radius sphere in our galaxy ( the physical distances between sources a and b and the line of sight to pks  2155 - 304 , if both sources are put at 30 kpc from us , in the outskirts of the galactic halo ) is of @xmath193 , making prior ionization by a powerful transient source highly unlikely , albeit with _ a posteriori _ statistics .",
    "a final possibility is that in the past the center of our galaxy went through an agn phase , producing far higher luminosities and photoionizing any low - density ( @xmath194 @xmath80 ) clouds in the galactic halo . at these densities",
    "we have @xmath195 years .",
    "let us then suppose that less than @xmath196 years ago the @xmath197 @xmath198 black hole in the center of our galaxy ( chakrabarty & saha , 2001 ) was emitting at its eddington luminosity of @xmath199 erg  s@xmath8 . assuming a typical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for agn ( mathews & ferland , 1987 ) this would produce an ionization parameter of @xmath200 at the surface of @xmath174 @xmath25 halo clouds located at a distance d from the central agn . to produce the observed line ratios , the photoionization contribution must be such that @xmath201 at the illuminated face of such a cloud of gas .",
    "this gives a distance for the gas cloud of @xmath202 kpc , consistent with the outermost size of the galactic halo .",
    "this solution requires that all halo clouds would show uv and x - ray absorption with similar physical properties as those observed in pks  2155 - 304 . using the much lower luminosities estimated by asca for the central agn in our galaxy about @xmath203 years ago ( i.e. @xmath204 erg s@xmath8 , koyama et al . , 1996 ) , gives distances of 1 - 5 kpc , well within the galaxy s halo , and therefore not consistent with the the galactic coordinates of pks  2155 - 304 ( given our distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center ) .      from our analysis of the combined uv and x - ray data",
    ", we conclude that the x - ray absorption and at least the broad ovi@xmath47 are likely to be produced in tenuous extragalactic medium , with @xmath205 @xmath80 . from the position of the ovi@xmath206 and assuming that the feature lies within a few mpc from our galaxy , the gas is falling toward our galaxy with a bulk velocity of @xmath207 km s@xmath8 ( in the galactic standard of rest frame ) .",
    "the feature has a dispersion velocity ( @xmath208 km  s@xmath8 ) comparable with the bulk velocity , and a temperature of logt@xmath209 . the implied overdensity is @xmath126 and the total linear size of the feature along our line of sight is about @xmath210_{0.3\\odot}^{-1}$ ] mpc .",
    "the ne / o abundance can be reduced to solar if we allow for inhomogeneities in the flow , since inhomogeneities increase the upper limits on both the temperature and the density , and so also decrease the lower limit on the linear size of the feature ( from 3 @xmath211_{0.3\\times\\odot}^{-1}$ ] mpc to @xmath212_{0.3\\times\\odot}^{-1}$ ] kpc ) . such inhomogeneities may arise near our galaxy halo , where the gas may mix with denser medium , cooling and producing part of the observed ovi@xmath206 absorption .",
    "the above overdensities and linear sizes are consistent with those predicted for the whim by hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of structure in the local universe ( e.g. hellsten , 1998 ) , and in particular in our local group ( kravtsov , klypin , and hoffman , 2001 ) . according to these simulations",
    ", the local igm is concentrated in filaments with overdensities of @xmath213 connecting already virialized structured ( galaxies and clusters of galaxies ) , that were shock - heated during the collapse of the density perturbations .",
    "the average sizes of these perturbations are of the order of 30 - 50 mpc in the local universe , but the total extent of the density peaks are usually not larger than a few mpc .",
    "the velocities of the matter in these filaments , should be of the order of the proper motions of the virialized structures that they connect , @xmath214 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we note that these velocities are of the same order as those observed on the blue side of the structured and complex ovi@xmath47 profile in the uv spectrum of pks  2155 - 304 .",
    "we also note that both the dynamics of this gas ( as derived from the ovi line ) and its physical state are very similar to those found ( using uv absorption lines only ) for the intervening ionized absorber along the line of sight to the quasar h  1821 + 643 ( tripp et al . , 2001 ) :",
    "internal dispersion velocities of the order of @xmath215 km s@xmath8 ( fwhm of the broad ly@xmath38 line ) , temperature in the range @xmath216 logt @xmath217 ( assuming pure collisional ionization ) , and pathlength of about 3 mpc ( using @xmath218 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ) .",
    "we predict that the planned high resolution and high quality x - ray spectra of this object , should then show ovii@xmath4 absorption with an intensity similar to that found here .      in virtually all the cases discussed",
    ", the ne / o ratio in the absorber along the line of sight towards pks  2155 - 304 is required to be higher than solar .",
    "there are various ways to reconcile with this problem : ( 1 ) type ii supernovae give rise to ne / o ratios much higher than type i supernovae , compared to si ( tsuro et al . , 1997 and references there in ) ;",
    "( 2 ) o can be depleted on to dust grains , but noble gas like ne would not . if superwinds from galaxies are responsible for the enrichment of the igm , then in order to produce high gaseous ne / o ratios compared to solar , they must be able to produce a considerable amount of dust before leaving the high density galaxy environment . ( 3 ) in the modeling above , we have assumed a simple parameterization of ionizing background . the true shape of the background is clearly more complex , and a harder background would result in a large ne / o ratio .",
    "any or all of these factors might be playing a role in the observed value of [ ne / o ] .",
    "it is important to notice that dust can easily survive at the kinetic temperatures ( i.e. @xmath219 k ) and densities ( i.e. @xmath220 @xmath80 ) of such a warm igm filament . in such regime ,",
    "the sputtering lifetime is inversely proportional to the gas density , and largely independent from the dust grain composition and gas temperature ( draine & salpeter , 1979a , b ) .",
    "the survival time of a small interstellar grain of size @xmath221  @xmath222 m will be larger than @xmath223  yr in the igm filament , and even larger for grains of larger size .",
    "we estimated the reddening expected along the line of sight to pks  2155 - 304 , based on ( a ) the observed equivalent h column density , ( b ) the typical size of a silicate dust grain , and ( c ) a typical ism gas / dust ratio . in this condition the estimated e(b - v )",
    "is of about @xmath224 mag , fully consistent with the observations ( schlegel et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "finally we note that [ ne / o ] overabundances of @xmath225 , compared to solar , have already been observed in several astrophysical environments ( e.g. paerels et al . , 2001 , brinkman et al . , 2001",
    ") , strongly suggesting that the non - o - depleted values of this quantity , measured in stelar atmospheres , are not representative of the average gaseous [ ne / o ] ratio in the universe .",
    "in this paper we report the first discovery of the `` x - ray forest '' of absorption lines produced by highly ionized intergalactic medium .",
    "high significance x - ray absorption lines of ovii , oviii and neix are detected along the line of sight to the bright blazar pks  2155 - 304 , and are associated with a known ovi uv absorber .",
    "we demonstrate that the dynamical properties of the x - ray and the uv absorber are fully consistent with each other , and that a reasonable common and self - consistent physical solution can be found only if photoionization and collisional ionization both contribute to the ionization of the absorbing gas .",
    "this requires electron densities of about @xmath226 @xmath80 for the diffuse x - ray background to be significant .",
    "this low denisty requires a linear size , along the line of sight , of the order of @xmath227_{0.3\\times\\odot}^{-1}$ ] mpc .",
    "this clearly locates the absorber outside our galaxy in intergalactic space .",
    "we demonstrate that both the dynamical and physical properties of such an absorber are remarkably consistent with those predicted for the low redshift warm phase of the igm as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations for the formation of structures in the universe .",
    "finally we find that solutions with a ne / o ratio of about 2.5 times solar are favored , suggesting type - ii supernova enrichment , or the presence of dust in the igm .",
