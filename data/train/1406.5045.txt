    "the calculation of the resistance between two arbitrary nodes in resistor networks is the classic problem in electric circuit theory and was first studied by kirchhoff in 1847 @xcite .",
    "the problem has attracted the interest of numerous physicists over many years because it is intrinsically connected to a wide range of other physics problems , including random walks @xcite , first - passage processes @xcite , lattice green s functions @xcite and classical transport in disordered media @xcite . the resistance @xmath0 between two nodes @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 can be considered as a metric called `` resistance distance '' @xcite .",
    "if there are many ( few ) paths between the two nodes , the resistance @xmath0 is small ( large ) .",
    "the total resistance distance of a graph , also called the `` kirchhoff index '' @xcite ( i.e. , the sum of resistance distances between all pairs of nodes ) is related to the network criticality @xcite , which characterises its robustness .    in the past",
    ", resistance - computation studies have focused mainly on infinite lattices @xcite . recently",
    ", attention has shifted to the study of resistance on finite networks , as these are the configurations of relevance to real life .",
    "for this reason , there has been a surge of research activity in recent years . in 2004",
    "wu @xcite derived a compact expression for the resistance between two arbitrary nodes for finite , regular lattice networks in terms of the associated laplacian .",
    "that approach , however , requires a complete knowledge of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian .",
    "this is straightforward to obtain for regular lattices in any dimensions , since the laplacian for @xmath3-dimensional regular lattices can be represented as the sum of @xmath3 one - dimensional laplacians , with known eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "however , the approach can not readily deal with non - regular lattices .",
    "for this reason , izmailian , kenna and wu extended the approach to enable derivation of a closed - form expression for the resistance between two arbitrary nodes for finite networks in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the _ first minor _ of the laplacian @xcite .",
    "the new approach has been applied to the cobweb and fan resistor networks @xcite .",
    "an alternative recent approach to the calculation of two - point resistances on distance - regular networks was based on the stratification of the network and the associated stieltjes function @xcite .",
    "still another approach of computing resistances by using a method of direct summation has been developed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the recent approaches @xcite are further generalized to compute two - point resistances based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the _ second _ minor of the laplacian associated with the network .",
    "the generalized approach is illustrated by application to the resistor network with configuration of a globe .",
    "in particular , the resistance between two arbitrary nodes on such a network is determined in the form of single summation , allowing determination to arbitrary precision .",
    "let us consider a resistor network consisting of @xmath4 nodes and let @xmath5 be the resistance of the resistor connecting nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the resistance between arbitrary nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be written as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 are nonzero eigenvalues with orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath10 of the laplacian @xmath11 of that network .",
    "determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian is usually a very difficult problem .",
    "one way of approaching it is to reduce the original problem to that of 1d laplacians with appropriate boundary conditions . for regular rectangular lattices ,",
    "this can be achieved in any dimension in a straightforward manner .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian for the 1d lattice with various boundary conditions are then easy to calculate and they given in appendix 1 .",
    "let us now consider , for example , the laplacian for regular , two - dimensional , rectangular lattices .",
    "denote by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 the laplacian of a 1d lattice with free , periodic , dirichlet - neumann and dirichlet - dirichlet boundary conditions , respectively and let @xmath16 be the @xmath17 identity matrix .",
    "then , the 2d laplacian of the resistor network @xmath18 consisting of a @xmath19 rectangular lattice with free , cylindrical and toroidal boundary conditions and with resistors @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the two directions , can be expressed through the laplacians of the 1d lattices as @xcite @xmath22 thus , the 2d laplacian @xmath18 can be diagonalize in the two subspaces separately , yielding eigenvalues and eigenvectors @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the appropriate 1d laplacian .",
    "but for non - regular lattices , such as the cobweb and fan networks consisting of @xmath26 sites , it is impossible to express the 2d laplacian @xmath27 of the network through the laplacians of such 1d lattices .",
    "this means that it is difficult to apply wu s method @xcite . instead ,",
    "on can apply the method of izmailian , kenna and wu ( `` ikw method '' ) @xcite to compute resistance by using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the _ first minor _ of the 2d laplacian .",
    "indeed , the first minor @xmath28 of the 2d laplacian @xmath27 can be reduced to the laplacian of a 1d lattice and can be written as @xcite @xmath29 then the resistance between nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be written as @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath9 are eigenvalues with orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath10 of the minor @xmath31 .",
    "note , that all eigenvalues of the minor @xmath31 have nonzero value .",
    "therefore , to compute resistances on regular @xmath19 rectangular lattices with free , cylindrical and toroidal boundary conditions , one can use the wu method @xcite . to compute resistances on non - regular rectangular lattices , such as the cobweb and fan networks one can use ikw method @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two approaches is that in the wu method one expresses the resistance through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the full laplacian of the network , while in the ikw method the resistance is expressed through the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the first minor of the laplacian of the network .",
    "there are , however , other non - regular rectangular lattices , such as the globe network comprising @xmath32 sites , for which it is impossible to express the laplacian @xmath33 or the first minor of the laplacian through laplacians 1d lattices .",
    "it is therefore difficult to apply either the wu @xcite or ikw @xcite methods to calculate resistances between nodes for such a network , however , in this circumstance , the second minor @xmath34 of the laplacian @xmath33 can be written as @xmath35 in what follows we shall show how to calculate resistances @xmath36 on the globe network using the modified laplacian approach , i.e. , by expressing the resistance through eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the second minor of the laplacian of the network .",
    "extension to networks of similar geometries is possible in a straightforward manner .",
    "let us consider a network , in which the total number of nodes is @xmath37 .",
    "let us denote the nodes by the index @xmath1 , wherein @xmath1 takes values @xmath38 .",
    "denote the electric potential at the @xmath1th node by @xmath39 and the current flowing into the network at the @xmath1th node by @xmath40 .",
    "we write kirchhoff s law as @xmath41 with the constraint @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the conductance , which can be expressed through the resistance of the resistor connecting nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath5 as @xmath44 eq .",
    "( [ kirchhoff ] ) can be written in matrix form as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the laplacian of the system @xmath47 and @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are vectors @xmath52 under the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) we actually have only @xmath53 independent equations in eq .",
    "( [ kirchhoff ] ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "therefore , we choose to delete the equation numbered @xmath54 and choose the potential at node @xmath53 to be zero : @xmath55 .",
    "then the @xmath56 equations in ( [ kirchhoff ] ) are reduced to the set of independent @xmath57 equations @xmath58 to this point , we have followed the ref .",
    "next we partition the set of equations ( [ kirchhoff1 ] ) into two parts .",
    "the first is a single equation and the second is a set of @xmath59 equations , _ viz . _ @xmath60 the set of equations ( [ kirchhoff2 ] ) can be written in the matrix form as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the second minor of the laplacian @xmath46 and is given by @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are vectors , which are now given by @xmath66 here @xmath67 , for @xmath68 .",
    "( [ matrix ] ) can now be straightforwardly solved for @xmath50 since @xmath69 is not singular .",

    "( [ v00 ] ) and ( [ vi2 ] ) give us expressions for @xmath39 ( @xmath80 ) in terms of the elements of the inverse matrix @xmath74 .    to compute the resistance @xmath81 between arbitrary two nodes @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ", we connect @xmath6 and @xmath7 to an external battery and measure the current @xmath82 going through the battery with no other nodes are connected to external sources .",
    "let the potentials at the two nodes be , respectively , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
