    "we denote @xmath7 as the @xmath8-time space .",
    "let @xmath9 be an integer , then two continuous function - valued functions are defined as @xmath10\\quad \\textrm{and}\\quad { \\boldsymbol{f}}\\colon\\mathcal{i}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{c}^0(\\mathbb{r}_+\\times\\mathbb{r}^d,\\mathbb{r}^d);\\ ; i\\mapsto f_i({\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}},{\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}})\\ ] ] where @xmath11 satisfy @xmath12 for some @xmath13 and @xmath14 , uniformly for @xmath15 .",
    "we notice here that @xmath16 is not necessarily linear with respect to the space variable @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two infinite sequence , where @xmath20 is strictly increasing with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then each pair @xmath23 gives rise to a piecewise constant , left continuous switching law @xmath24 with the switching - time sequence @xmath20 as follows : @xmath25 a quasi - linear switched system associated with a switching control can be expressed in the form of @xmath26 in this paper , we study the stabilization problem of above system by using the switching control @xmath27 and develop a sufficient condition for @xmath27 which can warrant the global exponential stability of the system .",
    "the interest of this goal has been primarily motivated due to this type of model is governed by many man - made and natural systems in mathematics , control engineering , biology and physics .",
    "studies of this type of problems fall under the category of  stabilization analysis \" in the control theory . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the study of time - varying switched systems with infinitely many subsystems is not available in current literature .    in order to study",
    "the stability of ( [ eq1.1 ] ) with a class of @xmath28 , an effective approach in literature is the perturbation method .",
    "that is , instead of considering ( [ eq1.1 ] ) directly , we consider the asymptotic stability of its linear approximation system @xmath29 if a control @xmath27 can stabilize the above system , then we study ( [ eq1.1 ] ) by viewing @xmath30 as a perturbation of ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to seek under what condition the asymptotic stability can still be maintained .    given a switching control @xmath27 , the fundamental characteristic for the stability of the switching system ( [ eq1.2 ] ) is the maximal lyapunov exponent , whose mathematical expression is given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 , denotes the solution of ( [ eq1.2 ] ) .",
    "however , it is well known in classical literature that for time - varying systems , its lyapunov exponent in general is not robust under ( even arbitrary small ) perturbation .",
    "thus it is not suitable for us to use the lyapunov exponent of ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to `` approximate '' ( [ eq1.1 ] ) to determine its asymptotic stability .",
    "even when @xmath34 is a constant matrix for each @xmath35 , the system ( [ eq1.1 ] ) becomes @xmath36 whose dynamics behavior is known to be similar to the time - varying systems due to the switching action .",
    "thus the same issue mentioned above still remains . in light of this , in @xcite the authors introduced a so - called _ liao - type exponent _ for ( [ eq1.4 ] ) when @xmath37 , is upper triangular , and show that this liao - type exponent is robust with respect to small perturbation .",
    "since we here are interested in the time - varying switched systems ( [ eq1.1 ] ) , the liao - type exponent defined in @xcite is no longer to be valid .",
    "this motivates us to look for a new type of exponent that can carry the asymptotic stability from the linear approximation ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to ( [ eq1.1 ] ) with the appearance of perturbation @xmath38 . in this paper",
    ", we will develop a new liao - type exponent for linear system ( [ eq1.2 ] ) which can provide three new important properties : ( i ) it is robust to many perturbations that satisfy linear growth condition ; ( ii ) it can capture the stability even if subsystems have unstable modes ; ( iii ) it includes the liao - type exponent defined in @xcite as a special case .",
    "the importance of properties ( i ) and ( iii ) are readily to be seen according to the goal of this paper .",
    "let us make some elaborations on property ( ii ) .",
    "for simplicity , we let the control set @xmath39 be finite , @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and assume @xmath42 is the finite - dimensional stationary distribution of the associated markovian chain @xmath43 , and set @xmath44_1=\\{\\sigma=(\\sigma_n)_{n=1}^{+\\infty}\\in\\varsigma_{k}^+\\,|\\ , \\sigma_1=i\\}\\quad \\textrm{for } 1\\le i\\le k.\\ ] ] standard approach is to define a positive definite , norm - like function @xmath45 , called the lyapunov function , on @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is a decreasing function of @xmath8 for all solutions @xmath48 of ( [ eq1.4 ] ) . for this , one needs to seek a symmetric and positive definite matrix @xmath49 such that the mean value of the maximum eigenvalues in terms of @xmath42 is negative , i.e. , @xmath50_1)<0;\\ ] ] see , e.g. , @xcite for more details .",
    "this condition requires that there exists at least one index @xmath51 such that @xmath52 which is equivalent to @xmath53 .",
    "thus a necessary condition for this approach is to require at least one subsystem to be dissipative ; in other words , there is a real positive constant @xmath54 such that @xmath55 for some index @xmath51 .",
    "if this necessary condition is not satisfied , for example when all subsystems have unstable models , then the approach mentioned above can not be applied . to require at least one subsystem to be dissipative",
    "seems too restrictive since even an exponentially stable subsystem may not be dissipative .",
    "this is because @xmath56 is stable @xmath57 @xmath58 for some constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 does not need to be equal to @xmath62 .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we will provide a new , more general definition of the liao - type exponents than that introduced in @xcite . in section  [ sec3 ] we will provide a computable criterion of asymptotic exponential stability , shown in theorem  [ thm3.1 ] .",
    "finally , the paper ends with concluding remarks in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the new liao - type exponent that is more general than the one given by  @xcite , for switched systems consisting of infinitely many non - autonomous subsystems : @xmath63 where , for each control value @xmath15 , @xmath64\\in\\mathbb{r}^{d\\times d}$ ] is a continuous upper triangular matrix - valued function of @xmath8 and @xmath65 is continuous with respect to @xmath66 , such that @xmath67 where @xmath68 both are independent of the indices @xmath35 .    given any @xmath69 , a sequence of positive real numbers @xmath70 is called a @xmath71-switching - time sequence , if it is a switching - time sequence ( i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath21 ) and such that @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .    in what follows ,",
    "we let @xmath75 be a switching law associated with @xmath76 and a @xmath71-switching - time sequence @xmath70 .",
    "then , @xmath77 defines a quasi - linear switching system @xmath78    [ def2.1]let @xmath79 be an arbitrarily given integer sequence such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a positive integer . associated to this sequence , for @xmath82 the real number @xmath83 is called a _ liao - type exponent _ of @xmath84 . here",
    "@xmath70 is a @xmath71-switching sequence determined by @xmath77 .",
    "notice that the new defined liao - type exponent @xmath85 depends on ( i ) the switching control @xmath86 ; ( ii ) the duration period @xmath87 $ ] on the corresponding subsystems .",
    "in particular , if we choose @xmath88 , then @xmath85 is just equal to the liao - type exponent @xmath89 defined in @xcite when the switched system is time invariant .",
    "thus , the new definition is a generalization of the one introduced by dai , huang and xiao in @xcite .    as the  linear approximation \" of @xmath82 ,",
    "we next consider the following linear switching system @xmath84 : @xmath90 then , @xmath91 is the ( maximal ) lyapunov exponent of the linear system @xmath84 .    from these definitions , we have @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , the following example shows that the new liao - type exponent captures the stability better than the one defined in @xcite .",
    "let us see an example .",
    "[ example2.2]let @xmath93 and @xmath94,\\quad { a}_1=\\left[\\begin{matrix}-2&0\\\\ 0&1\\end{matrix}\\right]\\ ] ] and define @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for the switching system @xmath97 : @xmath98 it is easy to see that although each subsystem has an unstable mode , the system @xmath97 , associated with this periodically switching control @xmath27 , is exponentially stable . by a simple calculation , we can get that @xmath99 , and associated to the sequence @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "however , the previously proposed liao - type exponent in @xcite equals @xmath62 .",
    "in addition , it is essential to see that , as is shown by example  [ example2.2 ] , @xmath102 does not need to imply any subsystems of @xmath84 stable .",
    "in this section , we will present a criterion of asymptotic , exponential stability for the switching system @xmath82 introduced in section  [ sec2 ] , which is an extension of ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2.2 ) .",
    "[ thm3.1]let @xmath103 be upper - triangular for each @xmath15 .",
    "assume @xmath84 has the liao - type exponent @xmath102 associated to a @xmath81-sequence @xmath79 .",
    "then , there exists a constant @xmath104 such that whenever @xmath105 for @xmath8 sufficiently large , the switching system @xmath106 is globally , asymptotically , exponentially stable .    if @xmath107 for all @xmath35 , then @xmath108 can be defined by @xmath109 where @xmath110    the following proof is motivated by the one given in  @xcite .",
    "the approach is a subtle combination of the new liao - type exponent and lyapunov functions .",
    "notice that there is no loss of generality in assuming that @xmath111 for any @xmath112 .",
    "next , we will first show the case when @xmath113 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the upper - triangular case will be discussed afterwards .",

    "then from ( [ eq2.2a ] ) , it follows that @xmath121 where @xmath122 is defined as in the theorem and @xmath81 is an upper bound of @xmath123 described in definition  [ def2.1 ] .",

    "assume @xmath156 and so @xmath157 for all @xmath112 .",
    "for all @xmath137 , we now define the lyapunov functions as follows : @xmath158 where for each @xmath137 , @xmath159 and at the time instant @xmath160 @xmath161 thus , by ( [ eq2.4 ] ) we have @xmath162 for any @xmath129 and any @xmath149 .",
    "this together with ( [ eq2.8 ] ) yields that @xmath163 for each @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is defined in the same way as in ( [ eq2.11 ] ) .",
    "then from ( [ eq2.15 ] ) , ( [ eq2.16 ] ) and ( [ eq2.14 ] ) , it follows that for any @xmath149 and any @xmath129 , we have @xmath166 thus , for any @xmath149 and any @xmath129 , by the gronwall inequality ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , for @xmath129 , @xmath173 also according to ( [ eq2.3 ] ) , we know @xmath174 for @xmath164 and @xmath112 .",

    "next , we notice that if @xmath179 where @xmath108 is as in the theorem , then we can always choose some @xmath144 with @xmath145 so that @xmath180 .",
    "now we assume that @xmath181 are upper - triangular for all @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath182.\\ ] ] denote @xmath183 where @xmath54 is a positive real number .",

    "thus , after the coordinates transformation @xmath186 , for those nonlinear perturbations which satisfy @xmath187 the conclusion follows by the argument of the first part if @xmath188 .    therefore , the proof of theorem  [ thm3.1 ] is completed .",
    "since under the hypothesis of theorem  [ thm3.1 ] every subsystems are non - autonomous and not necessarily lyapunov asymptotically stable , the standard method of lyapunov functions for proving asymptotic stability is hardly applied ( cf .",
