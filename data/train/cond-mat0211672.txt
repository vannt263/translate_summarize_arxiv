    "the interplay of various physical ingredients such as the strong hund coupling of the itinerant electrons to localized corespins , coulomb correlations , and electron - phonon coupling leads to a rich phase diagram including antiferromagnetic insulating , ferromagnetic metallic and charge ordered domains .",
    "the carriers moving in the spin and orbital background show remarkable dynamical features  @xcite .",
    "since full many - body calculations for a realistic model , including all degrees of freedom , are not possible yet , several approximate studies of simplified models have been performed in order to unravel individual pieces of the rich phase diagram of the manganites .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom are generally treated by a kondo lattice model , which in the strong hund coupling limit is commonly referred to as the double - exchange ( de ) model , a term introduced by zener  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the correlation of the itinerant @xmath11 electrons is well described by a nearest neighbor ( n.n . )",
    "coulomb interaction .",
    "the on - site hubbard term merely renormalizes the already strong hund coupling . for the kondo model with quantum spins , it is still impossible to derive rigorous numerical and analytical results . if the s=3/2 corespins are treated classically , however , the model can be treated by unbiased monte carlo techniques .",

    "it has been demonstrated that the results of the esf model are in excellent agreement with those of the original kondo model even for moderate values of @xmath15 .    in ref .",

    "the hopping parameter was determined by minimization of the ground - state energy .",
    "essential physical features of the original model could be described even quantitatively by uha , while the configuration space , and hence the numerical effort , was reduced by several orders of magnitude . besides the numerical advantage , uha also allows the derivation of analytical results in some limiting cases .    in the present paper",

    "so far , in most mc simulations the coulomb interaction of the @xmath11 electrons has been neglected due to its additional computational burden .",
