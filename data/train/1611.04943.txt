    "in this paper , we review the importance of many - body effects on the ballistic electron transport in a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) electron gas with varied confinement potential .",
    "this area of research has been receiving a considerable amount of attention in recent times ever since it was discovered that for a range of electron distribution and potential strength , the ground state of a 1d quantum wire splits into two rows with a wigner lattice beginning to form .",
    "it was also demonstrated that when a perpendicular magnetic field is applied , a double - row electron formation may change completely into a single row due to an enhanced confinement potential .",
    "furthermore , it has been verified experimentally that weak confinement , in competition with the electron - electron interaction , causes the electron level occupation to reorder so that the ground state , conforming to the standard or common type , passes through the excited levels . the data in ref .",
    "[ ] show that the energy levels may be controlled by exploiting their separate geometric dependence on confinement and electron density .",
    "this means that in simulating the electron transport data , many - body effects must be considered .",
    "it has been well known that electrostatic potential confinement of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) used to create a quasi-1d wire@xcite gives rise to quantization of the conductance@xcite in integer multiples of @xmath0 which is not affected by a weak electron - electron interaction@xcite .",
    "the long - range coulomb interaction between electrons becomes relatively important at low electron densities resulting in the formation of a 1d wigner crystal@xcite .",
    "but , the role played by the coulomb repulsion between electrons is also made greater until it overcomes the confinement potential , as the density is increased , at which point the ground state and one of the excited states are interchanged@xcite which may result in hybridization and anti - crossing . in refs . [ ] , conductance measurements were reported for weakly confined quantum wires in a 2deg and determined by the boundaries of top split - gates .",
    "experiment has shown that making the confinement potential less effective results in the appearance of two rows , accompanied by a sudden change in conductance @xmath1 from zero to @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior may be attributed to the possibility that there was no coupling between these two rows so that each row contributes independently and additively . another way to account for this",
    "is to say that their energy eigenstates become hybridized and the resulting state causes a breakdown of the single - particle picture when the coulomb interaction becomes important .",
    "recent investigations have confirmed that there exists a coulomb interaction between the rows resulting in this anomalous jump in the conductance@xcite .",
    "the devices used in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] were fabricated using electron beam lithography on @xmath3 nm deep gaas / algaas heterostructures . typically , the sample consisted of split gates , @xmath4 m long and @xmath5 m wide , and a top gate of width @xmath6 m defined above the split gates , separated by a @xmath7 nm layer of cross - linked polymethyl methacrylate .",
    "after partial illumination , the carrier density and mobility were estimated to be @xmath8@xmath9 and @xmath10@xmath11vs , respectively .",
    "the two - terminal conductance , @xmath12 , was measured at @xmath13mk , using a @xmath14hz voltage of @xmath15v .",
    "previously , the conductance through two laterally aligned but uncoupled parallel wires formed by surface gates have been shown to be the sum of the conductances of each individual wire , resulting in plateaus at multiples of @xmath2,@xcite indicating that hybridization of states within a wire is a many - body effect but not a single - particle one .",
    "two side - by - side wires with very small inter - wire separation have lent support for the theory , i.e. , there exists a coupling between the parallel wires@xcite . when this coupling between wires becomes strong , the electron wave functions hybridize , forming bonding and antibonding states , which manifest as anticrossings in the 1d energy subbands . our model calculations@xcite further confirm that the minimum energy gap between the states occurs at the point of anticrossing but is not given by the energy difference between the symmetric and antisymmetric states .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we present a schematic illustration of a device used in the experiments carried out in refs . [ ] , showing a pair of split gates and a top gate which adjust the confinement potential and carrier density by choosing their voltages suitably .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] also shows typical conductance features obtained with the device used in ref . [ ] as a function of the split - gate voltage , @xmath16 , for fixed top - gate voltage , @xmath17 .",
    "the traces for strong confinement are on the left - hand - side , whereas those for weak confinement are on the right .",
    "when the confinement is weak , the @xmath0 step may be lost and the @xmath2 appears as the lowest plateau@xcite .",
    "but , as the confinement is reduced further , the @xmath0 plateau is found to be restored .    with regard to the interpretation that the carriers separate into two rows",
    ", the observed emergence of the crossing or anticrossing of energy levels needs explanation , preferably with the use of a quantum - mechanical theory .",
    "this may be verified by calculations of the kinetic , direct coulomb and exchange energies of electrons in wires with intermediate widths as well as for two extreme limits of very narrow and wide wires .",
    "in fact , we have recently demonstrated that these cases may be tracked down to the physical mechanism responsible for switching of the ground state as the wire width is varied from one value to another@xcite . in the presence of the coulomb interaction ,",
    "two - electron states may be employed as a basis set for constructing the anticrossing - level states@xcite when two electrons travel ballistically along a quasi-1d channel .",
    "the corresponding calculations have shown that the significance of the coulomb induced level anticrossing within a quantum wire may be adjusted by varying the confinement potential with a top gate voltage@xcite .",
    "there has been related work on conductance measurements of a quasi-1d wire having a quantum dot within the channel due to the presence of an impurity , as well as imperfections in the device geometry.@xcite these undesired features may result in results differing from integer multiples of @xmath0 for the conductance steps@xciteor oscillations superimposed on the conductance trace@xcite .",
    "electron tunneling through the quantum dot in the channel as well as interference effects due to electron back - scattering from an impurity potential are believed to be responsible for these deviations in the values of the conductance plateaus of narrow quantum wires.@xcite    in the next section , we present a theoretical approach for calculating the conductance for a quasi-1d quantum wire at a low density of electrons . for this",
    ", we calculate the lowest energy eigenstates for a pair of interacting electrons within a confinement region .",
    "we explicitly determine the ground state of a dilute electron liquid and consequently the lowest conductance plateau . the complex two - electron tunneling@xcite is not included in this review since it does not contribute to the formation of conductance - plateaus .",
    "furthermore , we highlight below that there is a range of wire widths for which two - electron transport is mediated by anticrossing level states based on the coulomb interaction , and , therefore , it is not possible to describe the conductance by using a single - particle formalism .",
    "we will exploit the results for the eigenstates of a pair of interacting electrons within a harmonic confining potential@xcite . in ref .",
    "[ ] , a symmetric harmonic potential was introduced . according to kohn s theorem@xcite , for this potential the coulomb interaction should only affect the relative motion of electrons but not that for the center - of - mass .",
    "it has been pointed out that as a perpendicular magnetic field is increased , the ground state will oscillate between a spin singlet and a spin triplet .",
    "bryant@xcite showed these electron correlation effects depend on the area of containment . by solving the schrdinger equation exactly for two interacting electrons ,",
    "it becomes clear how correlations may select the ground state and give rise to quasiparticles which participate in the transport .",
    "coherent wavefunctions of two interacting electrons may be maintained during their transport along the channel if scattering by randomly distributed impurities and defects ( negligible lattice scattering at low temperatures ) is very small for high - mobility short channel samples .",
    "also , if the transmission coefficient for two injected electrons is almost perfect and the inelastic scattering between different two - electron states is nearly vanishing , we are able to use a quantum ballistic transport model for two interacting electrons then the coulomb interaction between electrons in the channel can be fully taken into account .",
    "ballistic transport of two - electron clusters is assumed along the channel ( @xmath18 ) direction . however , the finite width of a conduction channel in the transverse @xmath19 direction gives rise to quantization of the split cluster energy levels .",
    "each level is assigned to have a free - electron - like kinetic energy for a ballistically moving noninteracting two - electron cluster .",
    "this leads to a hierarchy of subbands with quadratic wave - vector dependence .",
    "the cluster energy levels are given by @xmath20 with label @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the wave vector of electrons along the channel , @xmath24 is the electron effective mass and the `` subband edges '' @xmath25 are presented after eq.([add16 ] ) in terms of the dimensionless coulomb integrals . for a fixed linear electron density @xmath26 ,",

    "we start by considering two interacting electrons in an elongated quantum dot within a quantum wire . for this quantum dot",

    "the single - particle eigenstates @xmath53 can be determined from the schrdinger equation @xmath54 , where the eigenfunctions @xmath55 constitute a complete orthonormal set @xmath56 in the single particle hilbert space .",

    "therefore , both @xmath188 and @xmath193 levels are pushed up significantly at higher densities ( i.e. , @xmath189 ) , leading to a recovery of the ground state to @xmath201 . at the same time , the @xmath193 state in figs.[fig:2](c ) and [ fig:2](d ) changes from the degenerate ground state at lower @xmath26 to the highest - energy state at higher @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , under a transverse magnetic field , we expect that the @xmath188 state should decouple from the magnetic field due to total spin @xmath206 , while the degenerate @xmath193 state with total spin @xmath207 will be split into three by the zeeman effect , leading to new @xmath208 and @xmath209 conductance plateaus@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] presents a comparison of the conductance @xmath1 for both a noninteracting and interacting two - electron state in the range of @xmath210 . for very strong confinement in [ fig:2](a ) , the coulomb - interaction effect becomes negligible in comparison with the dominant kinetic energy of electrons and a conductance @xmath0 plateau remains with increasing @xmath26 . on the other hand , as @xmath183 goes up to @xmath211 in [ fig:3](b ) and @xmath203 in [ fig:3](c ) for cases with strong confinement , although @xmath1 for a noninteracting two - electron state remains largely unchanged , for an interacting two - electron state , the conductance @xmath0 plateau in fig .  [ fig:3](a ) is completely destroyed by the coulomb interaction and replaced by a new @xmath2 plateau .",
    "this unique feature is attributed to the result of both a level - crossing and a level anticrossing observed in fig.[fig:2](b ) . however , the new @xmath2 conductance plateau is severely perturbed at higher densities by a sharp spike and a followed by a deep dip to the lower @xmath0 plateau as @xmath212 for intermediate confinement in [ fig:3](d ) .",
    "although the dimensionless coulomb integrals do not depend on the linear electron density @xmath26 , the energy levels @xmath213 for a two - electron cluster is proportional to the occupation factors ( @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) in addition to these coulomb integrals .",
    "moreover , these occupation factors are determined by the chemical potential @xmath216 for noninteracting electrons through the fermi function for fixed @xmath26 . on the other hand , the cluster chemical potential @xmath132 , determined by eq.([e2 ] ) ,",
    "controls the behavior of cluster ballistic transport in the presence of a bias voltage @xmath35 .",
    "we present in fig.[fig:4 ] the change in the conductance plateau with increasing @xmath183 in the weak confinement regime . when @xmath217 , conductance plateaus for the noninteracting two - electron state are washed out in figs .",
    "[ fig:4](b)- [ fig:4](d ) due to very small single - particle energy level separation compared to the thermal energy @xmath218 .",
    "it is also evident that the incomplete @xmath2 conductance plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) for the interacting two - electron state is completely destroyed in this regime .",
    "however , the recovery of the single - particle - like @xmath0 plateau , as displayed in fig.[fig:3](a ) , is found in fig.[fig:4 ] . additionally , the @xmath0 plateau further expands and extends to lower and lower electron densities as @xmath183 increases to @xmath219 in fig.[fig:4](d ) .",
    "this unique reoccurrence feature can be fully accounted for by the rising energy levels at higher densities due to the relatively enhanced coulomb repulsion as shown in figs.[fig:2](c ) and [ fig:2](d ) .    as displayed in fig.[fig:2 ] ,",
    "both @xmath220 and @xmath221 remain degenerate for all chosen values of @xmath26 as far as @xmath197 or alternatively for only small @xmath26 values as @xmath222 .",
    "the level - crossing between @xmath223 and the degenerate levels @xmath220 and @xmath221 is the reason behind the upward jump of the conductance from @xmath0 to @xmath2 , as can be seen from fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "however , the degeneracy of the @xmath220 and @xmath221 levels may be lifted by an enhanced coulomb repulsion for @xmath190 as well as for large values of @xmath26 . consequently , the subsequent downward dip in the conductance from @xmath2 to @xmath0 is observed in fig.[fig:4 ] .    in order to acquire a complete picture of the quantum ballistic transport of interacting two - electron states passing through a quasi-1d conduction channel , we present the contour plots of electron conductance @xmath1 as functions of @xmath183 and @xmath26 in fig.[fig:7 ] for both noninteracting and interacting two - electron states as a direct comparison . by comparing fig.[fig:7](a ) with fig.[fig:7](b ) , we find that the effect of the coulomb coupling becomes most dominant in the upper right - hand corner of fig.[fig:7](b ) within a weak confinement regime and with a relatively high electron density at the same time . in this case , a gradually increasing conductance for noninteracting electrons is replaced by a @xmath0 conductance plateau .",
    "this is due to the coulomb repulsion in interacting two - electron states .",
    "in addition , another @xmath2 conductance plateau shows up in the lower right - hand corner of fig.[fig:7](b ) .",
    "this is separated by a spike in @xmath1 from the upper right - hand corner . in this region ,",
    "confinement is intermediate or strong but the electron density is high .    in our numerical results presented above , we limit the bias voltage @xmath35 to a very small value ( @xmath224mv ) , where @xmath1 becomes essentially independent of @xmath35 .",
    "the increase of @xmath35 can induce a `` hot - carrier '' effect and reduce the ballistic conductance with increasing temperature , as presented in fig.[fig:8 ] , where the conductances @xmath1 for both noninteracting [ in fig.[fig:8](a ) ] and interacting [ in fig.[fig:8](b ) ] with @xmath225mv are compared with each other . from figs.[fig:7](a ) and [ fig:7](b ) , we find @xmath1 for noninteracting electrons has been changed qualitatively for different values of @xmath35 , although @xmath1 for electron clusters is only modified quantitatively .",
    "we further demonstrate such a bias dependent effect on @xmath1 of electron clusters in fig.[fig:8](c ) , where three different values of @xmath35 are chosen for @xmath226@xmath192 . as can be seen from fig.[fig:8](c ) ,",
    "the spike in @xmath1 is significantly broadened and the plateau of @xmath1 on both sides of the spike is reduced simultaneously with increasing @xmath35 .",
    "this is similar to the hot - carrier effect with increased @xmath29 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the experimental aspects which are related to the preceding theoretical results .",
    "two - terminal differential conductance measurements were performed with an excitation voltage of @xmath15v at @xmath227hz using the oxford instruments cryofree dilution refrigerator , where the device is estimated to have an electron temperature of around @xmath13mk .    in order to the test the samples , a top gated , split gate device provided additional confinement to the quasi-1d electrons . this allowed us to vary the confinement from being very strong ( zero top gate ) to very weak ( very negative top gate voltage ) . in the present study , as shown in fig.[fig:9 ] , the top gate voltage , @xmath17 , is varied from @xmath228v ( left ) to @xmath229v ( right ) in steps of @xmath230mv .    figure  [ fig:9 ] shows a plot of the differential conductance in ( a ) for the device as a function of the split gate voltage @xmath16 for various values of the top gate voltage @xmath17 , as well as in ( b ) for the transconductance ( @xmath231 drawn from the data in ( a ) . as can be seen from fig.[fig:9](a ) , as the confinement is reduced ,",
    "the @xmath0 conductance plateau is weakened .",
    "if the confinement is further reduced , the @xmath0 plateau disappears and is replaced by a direct jump in conductance to the ( rounded ) @xmath2 plateau at both @xmath232 and @xmath233v ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "eventually the first plateau at @xmath0 is recovered on further reducing the confinement to @xmath234v ( right - most red curve ) . in comparison with our calculated results presented in figs.[fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] ,",
    "we find the sequence from the appearance of the @xmath0 conductance plateau for small values of @xmath183 .",
    "we have obtained results for strong confinement as well as the @xmath2 conductance plateau for intermediate confinement , and again the @xmath0 conductance plateau in the weak - confinement regime which is preceded by a double - kink structure .",
    "in addition , from fig.[fig:9](b ) we know the crossing / anticrossing of the ground state and the first excited states depends on the confinement strength . here , when @xmath17 is around @xmath235v , the ground state and the first excited states cross , leading to energy reversal such that previous excited state becomes the new ground state , and then , the previous ground state further moves up in the energy and anticrosses with the second excited state .",
    "this observation qualitatively agrees with the calculated results presented in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the appearance / disappearance / reappearance of a conductance plateau has been qualitatively reproduced in our numerical calculations .",
    "this is displayed in fig.[fig:6 ] , although some non - monotonic features in our reported results are not verified experimentally .",
    "we acknowledge that there is some non - monotonic behavior in the results of our simulations , e.g. , in figs.[fig:6 ] and [ fig:4 ] , preceding the onset of the first conductance plateau which is verified by the experimental data .",
    "however , apart from this , we do believe that we have qualitatively reproduced a significant part of the experimentally observed recurrence of the first conductance plateau with increasing channel width .",
    "this is an aim of our review , and such an observation highlights the importance of the coulomb interaction between electrons after appreciably suppressing the electron kinetic energy contribution as the channel confinement becomes very weak .",
    "the ballistic conductance for a quasi-1d channel ( quantum wire ) has exhibited an interesting behavior as functions of the electron density as well as confinement .",
    "we demonstrated that electron - electron interaction plays a crucial role in our calculations in the weak confinement regime .",
    "extensive calculations were carried out in regards the effects due to confinement on the conductance and its associated dependence on the interplay between level anticrossing and crossing in quantum transport of two interacting - electron clusters . as shown in our numerical results , depending on the confinement parameter",
    ", the conductance manifests the signature of single - particle or interacting two - electron state behavior .",
    "this dependence can be observed in the deviation of the conductance from @xmath0 ( single - particle ) to @xmath2 ( interacting crossing state ) and back to @xmath0 ( interacting anticrossing state ) as a function of the width of the quantum wire .",
    "it is interesting to observe how many - body effects enter the calculation of the quantum ballistic conductance , where the center - of - mass velocity is not affected by the electron - electron interaction but the electron distribution is affected .",
    "we conclude that the experimental observations qualitatively agree well with our theoretical calculations .",
    "furthermore , such experimentally observed features for switching conductance plateau can be physically explained by the interchange of the ground between @xmath187 and the degenerate @xmath188 and @xmath193 and back to @xmath187 , which is reflected as an upward jump from @xmath0 to @xmath2 and followed by another step jump from @xmath2 back to @xmath0 with increasing channel width .                                                                   as a function of linear electron density @xmath26 with four different values of geometry ratio @xmath200 .",
