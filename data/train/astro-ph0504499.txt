    "hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) predict a filamentary structure of the universe where hi  in the igm clusters around galaxies ( e.g. dav et al .",

    "2003 ) , galaxy groups ( e.g. bowen et al . 2002 ) , and even voids ( e.g. stocke et al . 1995 ) . the cross - correction function of ly@xmath0absorbers and galaxies can be used to measure the extent to which the two populations of objects , absorbers and galaxies , are associated . in the press ",
    "schechter ( ps , press & schechter 1974 ) formalism , the ratio of the bias of the two populations of objects is equal to the amplitude ratio of the cross - correlation to the auto - correlation function ( e.g. mo & white 2002 ) . therefore , by ( i ) knowing the characteristic total ( dark plus baryonic ) halo mass ( and its relative bias ) of a galaxy population , ( ii ) measuring the galaxy auto correlation function , and ( iii ) measuring the absorber - galaxy cross - correlation function , the mass of the halos in which the absorbers are imbedded can be inferred .",
    "this method has been successfully used by @xcite .",
    "they cross - correlated mgii absorbers with luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) to show that the mgii absorbers are imbedded in halos with masses @xmath6 , consistent with the fact that mgii absorbers arise in damped ly@xmath0  ( dla ) systems , which are expected to have total halo masses of that order .",
    "moving from dlas to lower column density systems , the minihalo model ( e.g. mo & morris 1994 ) predicts a weaker absorber - galaxy cross - correlation function for absorbers associated with the lower - mass minihalos .",
    "the minihalo model has been criticised because too many halos per unit redshift would be required to account for the observed density of absorption lines , since the minihalos have small spatial cross sections .",
    "observational evidence lends more support to scenarios where absorbers are imbedded in large - scale filaments and galaxy groups .",
    "furthermore , the ps formalism does not count objects that have merged into larger collapsed objects ( mo & morris 1994 ) .",
    "perhaps the ps formalism can still work for low column density absorbers , if instead they are correlated with very large structures . here",
    "an alternative suggestion is made that if ly@xmath0  absorbers are imbedded in large scale structure , then their expected clustering properties should be consistent with large - scale filaments and galaxy groups .",
    "that is , within the ps formalism , a stronger cross - correlation function amplitude is expected for ly@xmath0  absorbers on large spatial scales .",

    "a reasonable number of absorbers overlapping with a galaxy survey sufficient in projected distance is needed .",
    "@xcite is the only published @xmath7@xmath80 absorber - galaxy cross - correlation function to - date , which used 17 absorbers along the 3c 273 line - of - sight .",
    "they found that absorbers are not distributed at random with respect to galaxies , but the absorber - galaxy correlation is weaker than the galaxy auto correlation on scales from 1 @xmath4 10 h@xmath9 mpc .",
    "the absorber - galaxy cross - correlation function is instrumental in establishing whether absorbers are associated with individual mini - halos or large scale structure . here",

    "hipass was used as its all sky coverage enables a uniform statistical comparison with the absorbers , and it identifies gas - rich dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , often missed by magnitude - limited optical surveys .",
    "low redshift  absorption systems were chosen from the literature to overlap with hicat , i.e. @xmath11@xmath1 + 25  and heliocentric velocity less than 12  700 , resulting in 141 absorbers from 36 sight - lines .",
    "there are 5  340 galaxies in the combined hipass catalogues .",
    "the cross - correlation function , @xmath12 is calculated from the davis & peebles ( 1983 ) estimator , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of data galaxy@xmath4data absorber pairs with projected separation , @xmath15 , and radial separation , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the number of data galaxy@xmath4random absorber pairs .",

    "the ratio of the cross- to auto - correlation function , @xmath29 , together with known halo biases at @xmath7@xmath80 ( mo & white 2002 , bouch , priv . comm . ) indicates a value of log(m/)@xmath3014 h@xmath5 for the mass of halos in which  absorbers are imbedded .",
    "this value agrees well with the median dynamical mass of galaxy groups in hipass , log(m/)@xmath3013.8 h@xmath5 ( stevens , 2005 ) .",

    "the results suggests that , on scales from 1@xmath410 h@xmath5 mpc ,  absorbers are associated with dark matter halos with masses of log(m/)@xmath3014  similar to that of galaxy groups .",
    "the flattening of @xmath20 at low @xmath15 suggests that absorbers tend to avoid the densest regions of the local universe .",
    "although observing individual systems may reveal an association of a ly@xmath0  absorber with a particular structure , be it a galaxy group , filament , void or galaxy halo , the statistical evidence presented here suggests that galaxy groups could be the dominant environment of low column density ly@xmath0  absorbers at @xmath7@xmath80 .",
