    "the advantage of the bragg experiment as compared to the stokes experiment is that one varies in a controlled way the energy and momentum imparted to the atoms .",

    "avoiding complications due to non - trivial interaction effects between the third hyperfine state present in the rf experiment @xcite and the trapped gas , is thus simpler to interpret .",

    "[ tdepfig ] shows , the scattering rate in the superfluid state has a large maximum below @xmath0 for @xmath71 .",
    "this maximum is due to a large quasiparticle scattering rate arising from the increased density of states at the fermi energy in the superfluid phase just below @xmath0 , @xmath72 . for @xmath71 , both scattering states @xmath73 and @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ uvexpression ] ) can be in the region around the fermi surface of a large density of states yielding an increased scattering rate .",
    "the maximum in the scattering rate depends crucially on the coherence factors for quasiparticle scattering in ( [ uvexpression ] ) adding , viz . , @xmath75 , for a spin flip .",
    "for bragg scattering into the same hyperfine state , the coherence factor is @xmath76 at the fermi surface and the increased density of states would not lead to a maximum in the scattering rate . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the scattering rate is suppressed by the increasing gap @xmath78 since the density of quasiparticles available for scattering scales as @xmath79 . for @xmath80",
    "the lasers can not break cooper pairs .",
    "the physical reason for the coherence factors adding ( @xmath75 ) for spin - flip scattering is that the quasiparticles carry the same spin in the superfluid as in the normal phase . on the other hand , in scattering without spin flip , which couples to the particle density",
    ", the particle number carried by the quasiparticles is suppressed at the fermi surface , since a quasiparticle is a superposition of a hole and a particle . in this case",
    "the coherence factors subtract ( @xmath81 )",
    ".    for increasing @xmath82 , the peak in the rate below @xmath0 decreases and eventually disappears for @xmath83 . from fig .",
    "[ tdepfig ] , we see that the scattering rate in the superfluid state is always smaller than in the normal state when @xmath84 ( green dashed and black dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "this is because both scattering states can not be in the region around the fermi surface where the single particle density of states is increased .",
    "bragg scattering does not probe the increased density of states for the superfluid state for higher frequency as effectively as for @xmath85 , and the resulting rate is decreased compared to the normal state .",
    "note that the kink in scattering rate just below @xmath0 for @xmath86 , at which point @xmath87 , is physical .",
    "below this temperature , the gap is too large to allow the creation of two quasiparticles and the second term in ( [ uvexpression ] ) vanishes .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ tdepfig ] , for @xmath88 illustrates the case of large energy transfer , @xmath89 .",
    "contrary to the case @xmath90 , the rate is finite for @xmath14 as the energy transfer is large enought to break pairs and the second term in ( [ uvexpression ] ) is finite . for @xmath91 , the scattering rate approaches that of the normal state , as expected .",
    "we conclude that there is a peak in the scattering rate for @xmath92 and @xmath71 .",
    "also , the peak disappears unless @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; otherwise , both scattering states can not be in the region of increased density of states .",
    "we now consider the frequency dependence of the bragg scattering rate .",
    "figure  [ wdepfig ] shows the rate from ( [ rpa ] ) as a function of @xmath82 for the gas in the weak coupling limit with @xmath65 and @xmath95 .",
    "the scattering rate is depicted for various temperatures below and just above @xmath0 where the gas is normal .",
    "for comparison , we also plot the result of the single particle approximation ( [ uvexpression ] ) in the normal phase .",
    "the large peak in the normal phase response just above the single particle continuum arises from the spin wave present above the particle - hole continuum for an attractive interaction .",
    "the finite width of the peak is an artifact of our having included a small imaginary part in the frequency @xmath82 for computational reasons .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ wdepfig ] that when the gas becomes superfluid , the spin wave vanishes .",
    "this is because only potential flow , i.e. , density fluctuation modes , is possible in the superfluid  @xcite .",
    "other modes such as spin waves require a normal component to be present . in a trapped system",
    "this effect leads to the damping of the spin - dipole mode in the superfluid phase  @xcite . in the superfluid phase ,",
    "the particle - hole spectrum disappears and is replaced by a low frequency gap , which reflects the pair breaking energy described by the second term in ( [ uvexpression ] ) . at zero temperature",
    "the gas does not respont for @xmath80 , the minimum energy required to break a pair .",
    "the pairing gap can thus be detected directly as a gap of @xmath96 in the bragg spectrum . by contrast , in the rf experiment of @xcite the shift in the spectrum scales as @xmath97 , since one transfers particles to a third hyperfine state which in general interacts differently with the two paired hyperfine states  @xcite .",
    "we now consider bragg scattering in the weak coupling bec regime @xmath98 . in this limit , the molecules are tightly bound with a radius much smaller than the average interparticle distance , and are weakly interacting both with each other and with unbound atoms  @xcite .",

    "the spin - flip process illustrated in fig.[braggfig ] breaking the molecule and adding momentum @xmath131 creating two free @xmath101 atoms with momenta @xmath113 and @xmath114 corresponds to @xmath132 .",
    "however , the process @xmath133 connects to the same final state , and the two matrix element must be added coherently in the golden rule expression .",
    "we thus find the matrix element @xmath134 ( where the factor @xmath135 avoids double counting ) .",

    "this is as expected since the single particle spectral density is suppressed but finite for @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "[ spectralfig ] ) .",
    "also , @xmath227 is comparable to the pseudogap @xmath228 so thermal excitations are present . from ( [ imd0uni ] )",
    ", we see that that both effects make @xmath226 finite for small @xmath82 .",
    "the approximation @xmath229 to the spin - flip correlation function is not conserving and does therefore not obey the f - sum rule . to obtain a conserving approximation",
    ", we need to solve the integral equation in fig .",
    "[ feynfig ] ( b ) .",
    "this will change the quantitative form for @xmath230 .",
    "the solution is however an iteration with the @xmath164 matrix of @xmath229 .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath231 to have the same qualitative characteristics as @xmath218 , i.e. , a suppressed but finite spectral weight at low @xmath82 .",
    "solving the fully self - consistent equation for the spin - flip correlation function is beyond the scope of this paper @xcite .    in the bcs limit",
    ", we see that the emergence of a gap in the single particle spectrum leads to a maximum in the bragg scattering rate just below @xmath0 ( fig .  [ tdepfig ] ) .",
    "one could therefore expect a similar maximum to appear at unitarity at a temperature @xmath232 defined as the temperature where the pseudogap emerges .",
    "however , the presence of a maximum requires the spectral function to have well - defined sharp quasiparticle peaks like in the bcs case ( [ abcs ] ) .",
    "the pseudogap spectral function at unitarity ( fig .",
    "[ spectralfig ] ) on the other hand has peaks of width @xmath233 .",
    "there will therefore be no maximum in the bragg scattering rate for @xmath234 due to the emergence of the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the pseudogap present in the normal phase close to @xmath0 at unitarity leads to a significant suppression of the low frequency bragg scattering rate .",
    "the rate remains however finite since the pseudogap is only a suppression of the single particle spectral density , and because @xmath0 is comparable to the value of the pseudogap .",
    "the emergence of a pseudogap with lowering @xmath64 does not give rise to a maximum in the scattering rate , as opposed to the bcs case .",
    "this is because the quasiparticles are strongly damped at unitarity .",
    "we briefly comment on the possible experimental observation of the effects described in this paper .",
    "a typical fermi energy for trapped atomic gases is @xmath235hz .",
    "thus , we require a frequency resolution of the bragg experiment @xmath236hz .",
    "likewise , a typical fermi momentum of the gas is @xmath237m@xmath238 which is the same order of magnitude as the wave numbers for optical lasers .",
    "this means that the resulting angle between two laser beams needed to obtain a momentum transfer of @xmath239 is reasonable .",
    "the results presented in this paper are for a homogenous system . from the thomas - fermi approximation",
    ", we expect the presence of the trapping potential to smooth out features like the gap in the bragg spectrum . to avoid such smoothening , one could focus the laser beams on a smaller section of the cloud where the gas can be regarded as homogeneous . in this case , the results presented in the present paper become directly applicable .",
