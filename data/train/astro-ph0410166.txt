    "new , large galaxy datasets such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) give astronomy a view of the local universe with an unprecedented combination of completeness and detail .",
    "these surveys promise to refine our understanding of properties of galaxies , their relationships with environment , and their evolution .",
    "however , these catalogs consist of terabytes of data and are therefore currently too unwieldy simply to download onto a small workstation and investigate directly . furthermore",
    ", simple matched catalogs between many surveys exist only in the form of web interfaces such as ned . as indispensable as such interfaces are for studying a small number of individual objects on which one desires all the knowledge in the literature , they are not ideal for huge batch jobs designed to run automatically on relatively homogeneous data sets .",
    "finally , none of the databases interfacing to these huge catalogs yield any expression of the window function on the sky of the included surveys , leaving this critical determination to the user .    for these reasons",
    ", we have created a galaxy redshift catalog designed to aid in the study of the local universe .",
    "early versions of this catalog have proven invaluable to the sdss team , as they form the basis for the work studying the luminosity function , power spectrum , correlation function , and a number of other galaxy property and galaxy clustering statistics ; _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "non - sdss investigators have also used public data extracted from this catalog to investigate galaxy properties and their evolution ; _ e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "the catalog is small enough ( tens of gbytes ) to easily store on any modern machine , it contains matches between many major public catalogs , and it contains an explicit description of its window function .",
    "the current version of the catalog uses the sdss imaging survey as its basis , matching sources in other catalogs to that master list , and only tracking the sdss geometrical information . in the future we plan on incorporating other surveys more fully by explicitly including their geometrical information .    for most of the catalogs in the sample",
    ", we simply use the official public releases .",
    "however , we give the sdss ( of which the authors are participants ) a special status in this catalog .",
    "first , it is the only survey for which we track detailed information about the window function .",
    "second , for the sdss we use an independent set of reductions of the public data ( schlegel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "these reductions are significantly improved over the reductions made available through the data archive server ( das ) or catalog archive server ( cas ) on the sdss data release 2 ( dr2 ; @xcite ) web site .",
    "the essential improvement is that errors in the large - scale relative photometric calibration of the survey have a lower variance and less structure , making the catalog more appropriate for studies of large - scale structure ( as we demonstrate below ) .",
    "in addition , these reductions include an explicit expression for the survey geometry which the archive servers do not .",
    "secondarily , the naming and unit conventions in our catalog are different , as we describe in this paper . for these reasons , expect the quantities for objects in this catalog and the corresponding objects in the archive server catalogs to be very similar but not identical .",
    "this paper describes only the outline and general principles of the catalog .",
    "we leave the detailed documentation to a set of regularly updated web pages listed in table [ webpages ] .",
    "the paper contains : in section [ window ] , a short description of the geometrical expressions used in the catalog and how to use them ; in section [ constituents ] , a description of the constituent catalogs and how they are matched , focusing on the sdss ; in section [ other ] , a description of other derived quantities ; in section [ lowz ] , the presentation of a low redshift galaxy catalog based on this data ; in section [ tools ] , a short desription of some of the tools we have used to create this dataset which might be useful to the user as well ; and in section [ summary ] , a summary .    note that throughout we use the environmental variable $ vagc_redux to denote the root location of the nyu - vagc ; see the online documentation listed in table [ webpages ] for the actual root location .",
    "similarly , for the large - scale structure samples we describe below , we use the environmental variable $ lss_redux .",
    "in order to use galaxy surveys in a statistically meaningful way , we must describe their geometry on the sky .",
    "doing so is important in order to determine the size of the volume surveyed as well as to determine in what area of sky a particular type of object _ could have been _ observed .",
    "however , astronomers have no standard way of expressing such geometrical information . here",
    "we describe briefly the extremely general and compact system we use , introduced by @xcite .",
    "currently , we have described the sdss geometry using this method , but have not included geometrical information for the other catalogs in the nyu - vagc .",
    "following @xcite , we store the geometry on the sky as a set of disjoint convex spherical polygons .",
    "spherical polygons have several advantages : they are easy to express , it is easy to determine whether a point is inside or outside , and there exist relatively simple methods to transform them into spherical harmonic components ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , they can express a variety of shapes on the sky . since the window functions of surveys , in particular of the sdss survey as described below , are generally complex combinations of ( for example ) rectangles corresponding to imaging coverage and ( in the case of the sdss ) circles corresponding to the spectroscopic coverage , a flexible expression of the geometry is extremely useful .",
    "the polygons are defined as the intersection of a set of `` caps '' in the manner of andrew hamilton s product mangle ( see table [ webpages ] ) .",
    "each cap is defined as a part of a spherical surface separated out by slicing of the sphere by a plane .",
    "such a slicing cuts the sphere into two parts , and therefore choosing a cap means picking one of these parts .    in practice",
    ", we can fully specify a cap using four numbers ( three independent ones ) : the unit vector @xmath4 perpendicular to the plane slicing the sphere and the quantity @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the polar angle defining the angular cap radius .",
    "a positive @xmath7 indicates that a direction @xmath8 is inside the cap if @xmath9 a negative @xmath7 indicates that a point is inside the cap if @xmath10    for the value - added catalog we define the cartesian coordinates @xmath11 such that : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 refer to the j2000 right ascension and declination .",
    "the polygons are described in fits files of the form :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ survey_geometry.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    where `` survey '' indicates which survey we are describing .",
    "we also usually include ascii versions in the standard polygon format of @xcite in an ascii subdirectory wherever the fits version is found :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ascii / survey_geometry.ply + ascii / survey_geometry_info.dat _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    where the `` info '' file contains auxiliary columns describing properties associated with each area of sky ; in practice what these properties are varies depending on the survey in question .",
    "these files contain the geometrical description of each polygon .",
    "the format is described on the mangle homepage ( see table [ webpages ] ) .",
    "the description of how these structures are stored in the fits files is on the vagc web page ( see table [ webpages ] ) and tools exist in idlutils to read them into idl structures .",
    "it is often necessary to combine two sets of polygons describing two different surveys : for example , the sdss imaging survey and the sdss spectroscopic survey . in order to do so",
    ", we use a procedure known as `` balkanization '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the concept is simple , though the implementation is not .",
    "imagine plotting both sets of polygons on the same page .",
    "the lines plotted now define a new set of disjoint polygons bounded by caps , which we refer to as balkans .",
    "each balkan is either entirely inside both surveys or only inside one survey .",
    "we can express the intersection of the two catalogs as the set of balkans entirely inside both surveys .",
    "the code presented by @xcite ( see the web site listed in table [ webpages ] ) is capable of finding this set of balkans .",
    "here we describe the set of catalogs included in the nyu - vagc : the sdss , first , 2mass , 2dfgrs , iras psc@xmath15 , and the rc3 .",
    "the primary catalog is the sdss .",
    "the sdss is acquiring @xmath16 ccd imaging of @xmath17 of the northern galactic sky , and , from that imaging , selecting @xmath18 targets for spectroscopy , most of them galaxies with @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "automated software performs all of the data processing : astrometry @xcite ; source identification , deblending and photometry @xcite ; photometricity determination @xcite ; calibration @xcite ; spectroscopic target selection @xcite ; spectroscopic fiber placement @xcite ; and spectroscopic data reduction .",
    "an automated pipeline measures the redshifts and classifies the reduced spectra ( @xcite ; schlegel et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the nyu - vagc catalog corresponds to public data up to the sdss dr2 .",
    "we include three separate catalogs from sdss dr2 : the sdss imaging catalog , the sdss tiling catalog ( a description of the targets in the imaging catalog for which we have a well - defined completeness ) , and the sdss spectroscopic catalog .",
    "the top panel of figure [ sdssim ] shows the geometry of the portion of the sdss imaging survey ( dr2 ) released here , which includes 3514 sq deg of imaging .",
    "the green points in figure [ sdssim ] show the distribution on the sky of sdss spectra .",
    "this list of objects includes stars , qsos , and galaxies together . since the typical user of this catalog will be interested in galaxies , we recommend using the vagc_select bitmask described below if they want to select main sample type galaxies with @xmath20 .",
    "note that the criteria on which these are selected are slightly broader than those used to target galaxies in the sdss spectroscopy , so some of these galaxies will not have spectra for that reason .",
    "in addition , some of these `` galaxies '' will in fact be misidentified stars or other sources ( since our criteria will necessarily be less reliable than that used by the sdss target selection process ) . for maximum reliability",
    ", the user can always trim our catalog to obey the same criteria as the sdss target selection described in @xcite .",
    "the sdss imaging catalog presented here includes photometric reductions using photo v5_4 ( lupton et al . in preparation ) , and is described in @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the data set @xcite presents , it is calibrated using overlaps of sdss runs ( schlegel et al , in preparation ) .",
    "this procedure results in a more consistent large - scale calibration of the survey .",
    "in addition , as we describe below , the primary area of the survey is defined differently ( and thus includes a somewhat larger fraction of the total area of the dr2 imaging ) .",
    "we use some sdss jargon below to discuss the organization of the data .",
    "as described in the @xcite , a `` run '' is a sequence number assigned to a particular drift scan observation .",
    "a `` camcol '' ( between 1 and 6 ) indicates a set of @xmath16 ccds in the focal plane . in each run and camcol ,",
    "the imaging data are divided in the scan direction into @xmath21 arcmin `` fields '' for convenience .",
    "only a small number of the objects in the full sdss catalog are included here .",
    "specifically , we include only :    1 .   a sample of objects similar to the sdss main galaxy sample described by @xcite selected from the most recent ( v5_4 ) version of the imaging reductions .",
    "we have changed some parameters to be slightly more inclusive : 1 .",
    "we extend the extinction - corrected petrosian magnitude limit from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , in order to include spectroscopic objects which would otherwise scatter outside the original flux limits due to changes in calibration since targeting .",
    "we extend the star - magnitude separation from 0.3 mag to 0.2 mag ( expressed as @xmath24 in the @xmath25-band ; see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this change includes a small number of galaxies not included in the targeting , but also introduces a number of stellar sources into the catalog .",
    "we extend the bright fiber magnitude limit from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( effectively turning it off ) .",
    "we turn off the exclusion of small , bright objects ( with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "this change results in the inclusion of a small number of binary stars .",
    "the closest object within @xmath30 of the position of each sdss spectrum . in this match",
    ", we in fact give priority to objects that pass the previous criterion to be a spectroscopic galaxy target in the latest reductions .",
    "one might worry that this would introduce some sort of flux bias in the sample , since these targets are bright relative to the typical object , but in fact any pairs of objects with separations less than @xmath30 are likely to be spurious in any case .",
    "thus , taking the brightest one is usually the correct choice .",
    "3 .   the closest object within @xmath30 of the position of each main sample , qso , or luminous red galaxy spectroscopic target from the target version of the reductions which was fed to the tiling software ( a `` tiled target '' ) , whether or not they had spectra taken .",
    "these targets were selected based on earlier reductions of the imaging which differ in significant ways from the latest reductions .",
    "we have retained the petrosian half - light @xmath25-band surface brightness limit at @xmath31 .",
    "note that the new objects included by the extensions described above are unlikely to have _",
    "spectra_.    in fact , because of catalog errors , there remain a handful of pairs of objects within @xmath30 of each other ( 12 out of 693,331 ) . after removing these duplicates ,",
    "we include one observation of each object in the file :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ vagc_redux / object_sdss_imaging.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    which contains a trimmed set of the photometric measurements ( the exact list is described on the web page listed in table [ webpages ] ) .",
    "we use the environmental variable $ vagc_redux to denote the root location of the nyu - vagc ; see the online documentation for the actual root location .",
    "in addition , we store all of the photometric information for this set of objects in another set of files of the form :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ vagc_redux / sdss / parameters / calibobj-[run]-[camcol].fits , _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    where , as indicated , objects in separate `` runs '' and `` camcols '' are kept in separate files .",
    "the object_sdss_imaging file contains for each object its run and camcol , as well as its zero - indexed position in the corresponding calibobj file , allowing quick access to the full photometric information .",
    "the geometry of the sdss imaging survey is in a file :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ vagc_redux / sdss / sdss_imaging_geometry.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    stored in the form of spherical polygons .",
    "we create a list of polygons that describe the primary area of each imaging field . for each polygon , we give the sdss imaging field ( that is , its run , camcol , and field ) which we consider `` primary '' for the purpose of resolving duplicate observations .",
    "we should note here some points about the quantities in the sdss data we present ( some of which differ from data distributed by the archive servers ) :    1 .",
    "all fluxes are given in `` nanomaggies '' @xmath32 , which represent the flux ( multiplied by @xmath33 , as the prefix `` nano '' implies ) relative to that of the ab standard source with @xmath34 jy ( @xcite ) .",
    "they are related to standard astronomical magnitudes @xmath35 by the formula : @xmath36 2 .",
    "the zeropoints of the system are the same as that for the data on the archive servers , so that the conversion to ab magnitudes is the same as that given by @xcite .",
    "uncertainties are expressed in terms of the inverse variance ( usually used for calibrated quantities , with the suffix _",
    "ivar ) or in terms of the standard deviation ( usually used with uncalibrated quantities , with the suffix err ) .",
    "4 .   the column vagc_select is a bitmask that yields information on how each imaging object was selected , with the following bits : * near tiled target * near spectrum * pass the main sample galaxy criteria ( with the adjustments listed above ) + thus , an object which passed the galaxy criteria , and was near a tiled target , and was near a spectrum , would have bits 0 , 1 , and 2 all set , resulting in a numerical value of 7 for vagc_select .",
    "5 .   in addition to the local sky determination ( the @xmath37 by @xmath37 median smoothed sky in skyflux ) we provide the sky estimate for the current @xmath38 by @xmath39 field as a whole ( `` global '' sky ) in the parameter psp_skyflux ( in nanomaggies per arcsec@xmath40 ) . 6 .   a crude bulge - to - disk decomposition exists for each object processed by photo , which simply consists of taking the best fit de vaucouleurs model , the best fit exponential model , linearly combining them and refitting for the amplitudes of the models ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the fraction of the flux assigned to de vaucouleurs model ( the `` bulge fraction , '' if you will allow it ) is put in the column called fracpsf .",
    "in addition to these changes of form , there is a fundamental difference between the princeton reductions used here and the data available on the sdss archive servers  the relative photometric calibration ( schlegel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the archive server reductions use the calibration procedure described in @xcite , which involves comparing counts measured on the 2.5 m telescope , to those measured on a nearby 0.5 m photometric telescope on a slightly different filter system , to the fluxes of a set of primary standard stars ( on a yet different filter system ) . instead of this procedure , schlegel et al .",
    "( in preparation ) take advantage of the wide angular baseline provided by the drift scanning and of the large number of overlapping observations .",
    "this combination results in many exposures of the same stars taken on different nights .",
    "one can then use these multiple observations to fit for the calibration parameters ( system response , airmass term , flat fields ) as a function of time by minimizing the differences between the resulting inferred fluxes of the multiply - observed stars .",
    "this procedure , denoted `` ubercalibration , '' takes advantage of the fact that the system is photometrically stable within each drift scan run , and uses that to tie all the runs together using their overlapping observations .    as a demonstration that the procedure results in a lower variance in large - scale errors in the calibration , consider figure [ bluetip ] .",
    "the greyscale in the top two panels shows the @xmath41 color of the bluest stars in the magnitude range @xmath42 in each contiguous set of twenty fields in each run of the sdss ( all magnitudes extinction - corrected according to the dust maps of @xcite ) .",
    "we only show one section of the sdss coverage on the northern equator , but similar results hold elsewhere .",
    "this blue - tip color varies smoothly across the sky due to metallicity gradients in the galactic stellar halo , but has little small scale structure .",
    "the top panel shows this quantity for data we have calibrated to the sdss standard system using the photometric telescope ( though these results are _ not _ identical to those in the sdss archive ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same for the ubercalibrated data .",
    "both panels reveal the dependence of stellar metallity on galactic latitude , as well as some large - scale features in the stellar distribution .",
    "clearly , the stripy variations in the top panel , which are errors in the sdss calibration , are greatly reduced in the bottom panel ( though not eliminated ) .",
    "the 5-sigma clipped standard deviation in @xmath41 color over the whole sdss area is reduced from 0.02 to 0.01 mag between the pt calibration and the ubercalibration ( these numbers _ include _ the variation of the stellar populations ) .",
    "the rms variations of @xmath41 within several degree scale patches is about 0.007 mag .",
    "these results suggest that ubercalibration is a significant improvement over the standard calibration _ and _ that the calibration is good to about 1% .",
    "the sdss is taking long scans across the entire survey in the northern galactic cap , as well as scans that connect the three separated stripes in the southern galactic cap , that will reduce the systematic errors even further .",
    "our web site ( see table [ webpages ] ) has full documentation of the structure of the files described in this and subsequent sections and of all of the parameters they contain .",
    "the primary sdss spectroscopic program proceeds in the following manner . based on a set of images for which we have selected targets ( using the algorithms in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite )",
    ", the sdss defines a `` tiling region . '' for example , for tiling region 7 in the sdss , figure [ tilingregion ]",
    "shows the region we defined .",
    "given the tiling region and the set of targets within it we determine the location of spectroscopic tiles of radius 1.49 deg and decide to which targets to assign fibers ( @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure defines a set of 1.49 deg radius circles on the sky corresponding to the tiles .",
    "the intersection of the rectangles describing the tiling region and the circles describing the tiles defines the geometry of the tiling region . in this geometry",
    "we define `` sectors , '' each of which consists of a set of spherical polygons which could have been observed by a unique set of tiles .",
    "these sectors are the appropriate regions on which to define the completeness of the survey .",
    "see the dr2 web site for more complete documentation on tiling . in figure",
    "[ tilingregion ] , we have given each sector a different shade of grey .",
    "the union of the tiling regions defines the geometry of the spectroscopic survey as a whole .",
    "note that this geometry is not , generally , as simple as the total area covered by the tiles .",
    "for example , some regions are within 1.49 deg of the center of a tile , but the tile was created before spectroscopic targets for that region had been selected . this fact of life results in gaps in the survey which we track in our geometrical description of the survey .",

    "the relevant value will be listed in the online documentation , as it will in principle change over time .",
    "there are two basic files .",
    "first , there is one file fully describing the geometry    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ lss_combmask.drtwo14.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    which is readable with the idlutils routine read_fits_polygons and which contains a row for every spherical polygon .",
    "this geometry is the area covered by the imaging , by the set of survey tiles , and not near tycho stars ( as described below ) .    1 .",
    "sector : sector number ( see description of tiling geometry in section [ tiling ] ) 2 .",
    "fgotmain : fraction of main sample targets which have good redshifts in this sector 3 .",
    "mmax : flux limit based on targeting limit and change in calibration since targeting ( @xmath25-band magnitudes ) 4 .",
    "diffrun : whether the `` best '' imaging in this field is the same observation as the `` target '' imaging 5 .",
    "itiling_geometry : position ( zero - indexed ) of the tiling polygon ( see section [ tiling ] ) to which this polygon belongs 6 .",
    "itarget_geometry : position ( zero - indexed ) of the target polygon to which this polygon belongs ( in the file $ vagc_redux /sdss / sdss_target_geometry.fits ) 7 .",
    "ilss : index into the lss_geometry file described below 8 .",
    "ra : estimated center of the field this was based on ( j2000 degrees ) 9 .",
    "dec : estimated center of the field this was based on ( j2000 degrees )    ra and dec are not always inside the given polygon ; however , the polygon is _ always _ fully contained within a 0.36 deg circle surrounding that center .",
    "note that mmax varies with position for two reasons .",
    "first , the explicit targeting limits changed with time over the course of the survey .",
    "second , the calibration of the data has improved since the targeting , such that the flux limit in the recalibrated data varies across the sky .",
    "mmax accounts for both effects .",
    "there is an idl utility in the vagc product called get_sdss_icomb which takes right ascension and declination values , and quickly checks which row of the lss_combmask file it is contained in . because this piece of code is relatively simple and",
    "self - contained , we reproduce it in full in the appendix .",
    "second , there is a file describing the relationship each object in object_sdss_imaging has with the geometry :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ lss_index.drtwo14.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this file contains the columns :    1 .",

    "ztype : which catalog ( one - indexed ) from the above list the redshift comes from ( zero if none ) 5 .   sector : which sector the object is in 6 .",
    "fgotmain : main sample completeness for each object ( as described above ) 7 .",
    "mmax : what the nominal flux limit is in the area of sky this object is in 8 .",
    "ilss : which polygon in the lss_geometry file this object is in ( -1 if none ) 9 .",
    "icomb : which polygon in the lss_combmask file this object is in ( -1 if none ) 10 .",
    "vagc_select : how this object was selected ( see section [ sdss_imaging ] )    this file can be used to make some simple cuts to select galaxies with redshifts .",
    "the sdss redshifts include those which have the zwarning flag set but we have determined to be good and flagged good_z ( see section [ eyeball ] ) , as well as those which we have matched using the extended matching criterion described in section [ matchspec ] .    in addition , there are two files describing the geometry , out of which we have built lss_combmask :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ lss_geometry.drtwo14.fits + lss_bsmask.drtwo14.fits _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    each of these files contain sets of spherical polygons .",
    "the first file contains the geometry of the survey as a whole .",
    "the second file contains a mask cut out around bright stars ( stars with @xmath106 in the tycho catalog ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of the circle around each bright star is set according to the formula : @xmath107 where @xmath6 is in arcmin , @xmath108 is the tycho magnitude @xmath109 if @xmath110 , but @xmath111 if @xmath112 and @xmath113 if @xmath114 .",
    "this radius is about that at which the mean density of galaxies near tycho stars drops to half the background value ( i.  strateva , private communication ) .",
    "the mask is designed such that each polygon describing it is fully contained in a single polygon of the lss_geometry file ( which one is stored in the ilss column ) .",
    "finally , the directory :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ lss_redux / drtwo14/random/ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    contains one hundred random catalogs with one million points each , distributed with constant surface density in the area included by lss_combmask .",
    "in addition to right ascension and declination , this file contains ilss , indicating which polygon of lss_geometry the random point is in , and ebv , the @xmath115 value for this direction from @xcite .",
    "one of the areas of the sdss which requires special care is in the treatment of galaxies at low redshift . in order to study the property of galaxies at low redshifts and ,",
    "correspondingly , at low luminosities , we have done some simple checks of the sdss catalog in this regime , cleaned up the catalog where it was simple to do so , and put together a `` low - redshift '' catalog of galaxies with estimated comoving distances in the range @xmath117 @xmath57 mpc .    for the purposes of this catalog , we checked the atlas images and spectra of a number of galaxies .",
    "we flagged bad deblends as errors and set other quality flags according to section [ eyeball ] .",
    "in particular , in dr2 we have checked all objects in the catalog that we have selected as main - sample - like objects ( see section [ sdss_imaging ] ) , that have a spectrum , and that satisfy one of the following criteria :    1 .   @xmath118 and @xmath119 , if a good redshift exists in the sample redshift range , the object is not classified as a double star according the algorithm in section [ doublestar ] , and it is not classified as an m star .",
    "we deemed about 22% of these to be deblending errors in the latest reductions ; for about 72% of these errors ( 16% of the total number ) using the parent photometry is sufficient .",
    "so we recover about 94% of the objects in this category .",
    "@xmath120 , if a good redshift exists , the object is not classified as a double star according the algorithm in section [ doublestar ] , and it is not a star .",
    "again , about 19% are deblending errors , for 70% of which ( 14% of the total number ) the parent photometry is sufficient , thus recovering about 96% of the galaxies in this category .",
    "the spectroscopic pipeline warning flag zwarning is set to something non - zero , indicating a problem . for many of these ( about 25% )",
    "the software in fact finds a correct redshift , and we flag these as good_z ( see table [ quality ] ) .",
    "this yields 97 more galaxies in our sample .",
    "the galaxy is in a pair with a separation less than 50 @xmath57 kpc and an angular separation less than 0.1 deg . about 12% of these",
    "are incorrectly deblended in this sample , about 37% of which ( 4% of the full sample ) could be replaced with the parent photometry , yielding a recovery rate of 92% of the galaxies in this category .",
    "thus , after performing these checks , we are correctly treating the photometry for @xmath121 of the galaxies for which we have spectroscopy .",
    "we select galaxies from the nyu - vagc for the low - redshift sample according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "the galaxy is selected by the main sample - like criterion defined in section [ sdss_imaging ] ( that is , the bitmask vagc_select has bit 2 set ) .",
    "the quality bit has no flags set except for done and/or good_z or bad_parent_center ; _ or _ it has use_anyway or use_parent set .",
    "3 .   the spectroscopic subclass does not indicate an m star .",
    "we have not classified the object as a double star ( see section [ doublestar ] ) .",
    "there is a good sdss redshift determination ( meaning the spectroscopic flag zwarning was zero or the quality flag good_z was non - zero ) .",
    "the distance estimate from section [ distance ] yields a distance redshift within the range @xmath116 ( see below ) .",
    "the object is within the large - scale structure geometry and outside the bright star mask ( see section [ lss ] ) .",
    "the galactic extinction corrected , @xmath25 band petrosian magnitude is less than the flux limit in the given direction ( see section [ lss ] ) .",
    "the redshifts we use include those matched to the imaging objects using the criterion described in section [ matchspec ] .",
    "note that we do not require that the object be spectroscopically classified as a galaxy ; a certain number of low redshift galaxies are classified as stars , especially in cases that the spectrum has a low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the low redshift cut corresponds to @xmath122 @xmath57 mpc .",
    "we do not consider anything below this redshift because the sample becomes highly incomplete ( due to shredding by the photometric pipeline of large resolved galaxies ) and the distance estimates for such objects are highly affected by peculiar velocities .    for galaxies with use_parent set ,",
    "we replace the sdss child s photometry with that of the parent , using the results described in section [ eyeball ] .    in the dr2 area , 28,089 galaxies",
    "pass the above criteria .",
    "weighted by the completeness , the effective area of the sample is 2220.9 square degrees .    to compute the global number densities of galaxies as a function of their properties , it is necessary to compute the number - density contribution @xmath123 for each galaxy , where @xmath124 is the volume covered by the survey in which this galaxy could have been observed , accounting for the flux , redshift limits , and completeness as a function of angle ( schmidt 1968 ) .",
    "we calculate this volume as follows : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the spectroscopic completeness as a function of angle , averaging about 90% across the survey .",
    "we determine this on a sector - by - sector basis ( it is the fgotmain value described in section [ lss ] ) .",
    "@xmath127 is defined for this sample by : @xmath128 the flux limit @xmath129 ( usually 17.77  mag ) implicitly sets @xmath130 by : @xmath131 note that over this redshift range we can ignore the contribution of the surface brightness limits to @xmath124 , since cosmological surface brightness dimming is such a small effect .",
    "there is a complication at low redshift : our estimate of the luminosity has a large uncertainty due to galaxy peculiar velocities .",
    "@xmath132  as calculated above is a nonlinear function of luminosity , such that an uncertainty in luminosity will yield an _ underestimate _ of @xmath132 . for a fair estimate of @xmath132 ,",
    "we use : @xmath133 where @xmath134 ( from equation [ likeden ] above ) .",
    "this estimate is an average of @xmath132  for all possible luminosities based on the probability of the galaxy having that luminosity . in practice",
    ", there is only a small difference between the results one finds using the regular @xmath124 estimator and this one .",

    "<S> here we present the new york university value - added galaxy catalog ( nyu - vagc ) , a catalog of local galaxies ( mostly below @xmath0 ) based on a set of publicly - released surveys matched to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies , qsos and stars ; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations , mostly from the sdss . excluding areas masked by bright stars </S>",
    "<S> , the photometric sample covers 3514 square degrees and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 square degrees ( with about 85% completeness ) . </S>",
    "<S> earlier , proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many sdss investigations of the power spectrum , correlation function , and luminosity function of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> future releases will follow future public releases of the sdss . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog includes matches to the two - micron all sky survey point source and extended source catalogs , the iras point source catalog redshift survey , the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey , the third reference catalog of galaxies , and the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters survey . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs ( for example , @xmath1-corrections and structural parameters for galaxies ) . the sdss catalog presented here </S>",
    "<S> is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the sdss data release 2 archive servers and is thus more appropriate for large - scale structure statistics , reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from @xmath2 to about @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog , including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors ( such as errors in deblending ) . </S>",
    "<S> this catalog is complementary to the sdss archive servers , in that nyu - vagc s calibration , geometrical description , and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large - scale structure statistics using the sdss spectroscopic catalog . </S>"
