    "in recent years , the field of molecular electronics has renewed the interest in transport through mesoscopic systems with strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "a number of experiments have been reported to demonstrate transport through single molecules,@xcite some of which show signs of vibrational sidebands . in the pioneering experiments by park et al.@xcite it was shown that electron transport through a single @xmath0 molecule was strongly influenced by a single vibrational mode .",
    "the single phonon mode was associated with the motion of the molecule in the confining potential created by the van der waals interactions with the electrodes . later",
    "similar devices with more complicate molecules were investigated@xcite and they also showed excitation spectra which possibly could be associated with emission of vibrational quanta , so - called frank condon peaks in the differential conductance .",
    "some of these devices@xcite furthermore exhibited a peak stemming from the kondo effect proving that the tunnel coupling to the leads was rather strong .",
    "theoretically there has been a large amount of work on the problem of tunneling through a single level with coupling to phonon modes .",
    "the approaches fall into two categories .",
    "the first category is the kinetic equation approach , which is relevant in the weak tunneling limit.@xcite in the kinetic equation approach , it is essential that the excited vibrational levels are allowed to relax through coupling to a bath . for",
    "a large phonon relaxation rate one can assume an equilibrium phonon distribution , otherwise a non - equilibrium distribution function must be determined from the kinetic equations.@xcite the coupling to the dissipative environment of the molecule leads to additional broadening of phonon sidebands.@xcite    the second category , in which also this paper falls , deals with the strong tunneling limit .",
    "the first approaches were an exact solution of a simplified situation , where only one electron is present,@xcite i.e. , the presence of the fermi sea is ignored .",
    "the result of this exact solution is that the phonon sidebands in the tunneling density of states all are lorentzians with the same width .",
    "the exact solution amounts to decoupling the electron and oscillator displacement operators .",
    "this decoupling approximation has been used in a number of papers.@xcite below we refer to this approximation as the `` single particle approximation '' ( spa ) and we demonstrate explicitly that this approximation is only valid for high energies , i.e. , for electrons or holes sufficiently far from the fermi surface , or in the weak tunneling limit where the rate equation is valid . for the many - body system",
    "many decay channels are in fact blocked by the pauli principle .",
    "other many - body works that include fermi sea effects have been done@xcite and the blocking of the line width has also been alluded to.@xcite    in this paper , we focus on the broadening of the frank - condon peaks in the differential conductance due to tunneling broadening , but in the non - kondo regime . while this case can not be solved exactly , an approximation , which is believed to be valid above the kondo temperature and which includes the pauli principle , but ignores correlations between lead electrons , is developed .",
    "the main result is that the combination of the pauli principle and the splitting of the spectral weight into phonon sidebands severely limits the phase space for tunnel broadening .",
    "hence the peaks are much narrower than the bare tunneling rate would suggest .",
    "we find a simple analytic result that describes this , see eq .",
    "( [ gappr ] ) and compare with the spa formula in eq .",
    "( [ grspanew ] ) .",
    "the approximation is exact in both the single particle limit and in the weak tunneling limit .",
    "furthermore , we also support our conclusion by a perturbation theory in the electron - phonon coupling derived in appendix [ app : pert ] .",
    "we consider a model of a single electron level coupled to two leads . the single level is coupled to a vibrational mode of the molecule through the onsite energy . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the spin degree of freedom , which is not relevant unless kondo - type effects are important .",
    "the model hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the oscillator degree of freedom and @xmath4 is the bare onsite energy .",
    "the lead electron energies are given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential of the lead @xmath7 .",
    "the tunneling amplitude between lead @xmath7 and the molecule is @xmath8 .",
    "the amplitudes could in principle also depend on the oscillator position .",
    "however , in the experimental realizations so far this is a negligible dependence and it is omitted here . because of this , we can apply the current formula derived by wingreen and meir@xcite who expressed the current in terms of the non - equilibrium green s function of the molecule .",
    "the current through the system is @xmath9   a(\\xi),\\label{igeneral}\\ ] ] where the left and right distribution functions are @xmath10 and where @xmath11 is the usual fermi - dirac function .",
    "the spectral function , @xmath12 , is given by @xmath13 where the retarded green s , @xmath14 , functions are @xmath15 the widths of the level due to coupling to the leads are @xmath16 the green s function @xmath14 must be calculated in non - equilibrium and in the presence of the leads .",
    "it is often useful to eliminate the linear coupling terms of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hstart ] ) by a unitary transformation similar to one used in the independent boson model.@xcite the transformation is @xmath17 and with this choice the hamiltonian transforms into @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 the retarded green s function becomes after this transformation @xmath21 where the average of course should be taken with respect to @xmath22 , which is indicated by @xmath23",
    "in this section , we calculate the spectral function , @xmath24 that enters into the current formula , eq .",
    "( [ igeneral ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , the tunneling broadening of phonon assisted side bands has been considered before in the case when the presence of the fermi sea is ignored(spa ) . in this case",
    "the model can be solved exactly , at least in the so - called wide band limit ( wbl ) .",
    "@xcite for latter reference we start by quoting the spa result @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the green s function in the absence of tunneling .",
    "we see from this expression that the spa  implies that all conductance steps are smeared by the same amount .      in the following ,",
    "we develop a method to calculate the broadened green s function using a truncated equation of motion technique .",
    "our starting point is the retarded green s function in eq .",

    "( [ fnn ] ) .",
    "we now generate a series of equations of motion , starting with one for @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the contribution stemming from the tunneling hamiltonian .",

    "again the tunneling term generates new higher order green s functions , but at this point we truncate it using the following physical principles : we neglect correlations involving lead electrons , which means that we decouple terms lead electron operators using the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "furthermore , we set @xmath40 in the equation of motion for ( [ grkdef ] ) and ( [ grndkdef ] ) . with these approximations ( see appendix [ app : eom ] for more details ) @xmath41 it is now worth to note that in the case with only one electron , which is the spa , the term @xmath42 is exactly zero and eq .",
    "( [ ltknl ] ) becomes exact for this case . in the same limit , @xmath43 and the equations",
    "are easily solved . after setting the result back into eq .",
    "( [ grddef ] ) we get @xmath44 which is nothing but the spa result in eq .",

    "we want to go beyond the spa and we continue by looking at the equation of motion for the last green s function in eq .",
    "( [ grndkdef ] ) .",

    "this is allowed because it cancels when adding the two @xmath59-terms in ( [ gfinal ] ) ( which is easily seen by noting that @xmath60 ) .",
    "note that @xmath61 is a function of @xmath62 only and that @xmath63 . at large values of @xmath62",
    "the @xmath59-function has the asymptotic form @xmath64 , while for small @xmath65 it goes as @xmath66 .",
    "the only remaining question is how to evaluate the last term in eq .",

    "this is a reasonable approximation .",
    "however , in the more general case we should in principle solve the terms @xmath71 and @xmath72 on first right hand of ( [ gfinal ] ) self - consistently . in the general non - equilibrium case",
    ", it is , however , not possible to calculate these expectation values from the retarded green s function alone .",
    "one must therefore invoke new approximations for this purpose . instead of pursuing that , we concentrate on a case where this is not necessary , namely the situation of a strongly asymmetric device .",
