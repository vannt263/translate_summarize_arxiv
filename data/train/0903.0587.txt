    "microfluidic devices are becoming a means of performing low cost and high - throughput chemical and biochemical analysis on chip .",
    "the range of applications include measuring dynamics of protein folding  @xcite , kinetics of enzyme reactions  @xcite and surface patterning of cells and proteins  @xcite .",
    "some of these applications generally involve cross - stream interaction of two or more fluids flowing side by side in a channel .",
    "however , such systems are characterized by laminar flow due to the small dimensions involved and thus fluids flowing side by side can only mix or interact by molecular diffusion .    in pressure driven flow through rectangular microchannels , where the fluid motion through the channel is actuated by pressure pumps ,",
    "the channel velocity profile is approximately parabolic across the shortest dimension , as dictated by the balance between the gradient of the applied pressure and the viscous shear stress in combination with the no - slip boundary condition at the walls . due to slow fluid motion close to the walls , tracer particles",
    "are hardly advected by the flow , thereby spending longer time at the walls . at the center of the channel ,",
    "on the other hand , the flow velocity is quite high and tracer particles are transported more efficiently .",
    "this results in a fairly wide distribution of the amount of time spent by tracer particles in the channel , the so - called residence time . as demonstrated",
    "experimentally  @xcite , this wide distribution of residence times gives rise to a non - uniform diffusive broadening across the channel .",
    "ismagilov et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed using confocal fluorescence microscopy that in contrast to the center line of the channel , where the extent ( along @xmath0 direction ) of the interdiffusion zone exhibits normal diffusive behavior @xmath1 ( @xmath2=distance from the inlet ) , it scales as one third power of the axial distance , @xmath3 , close to the top and bottom walls .",
    "these observations are shown to be in line with results of a scaling analysis , which makes use of a certain similarity with the general lvque problem  @xcite .",
    "numerical solution of the advection - diffusion problem  @xcite confirms the existence of the experimentally observed scaling behavior with an exponent of 1/3 in the proximity of the walls as compared to the exponent 1/2 at the center of the channel .",
    "furthermore , these calculations also show that the exponent 1/3 can only be observed if the distance ( along the flow ) from the entrance of the channel is not too large . at sufficiently large distances from the inlet , on the other hand",
    ", the exponent for diffusive broadening close to the walls approaches 1/2 and thus becomes identical to the scaling exponent in the center of the channel .",
    "the cross over distance , @xmath4 , is identified as the distance at which the tracer concentration along the shortest channel dimension ( @xmath5 direction ) becomes homogeneous ( note that @xmath6 is measured along the @xmath0 direction ) .",
    "the above mentioned numerical approaches assume a one dimensional parabolic velocity profile and neglect any dependence of the fluid velocity on the distance @xmath2 from the inlet as well as on the `` neutral '' direction , @xmath0 .",
    "the first assumption is valid at axial distances @xmath7 ( @xmath8=width and @xmath9=height of the channel ) , where the flow is fully developed .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 , on the other hand , can only be neglected if the width of the channel is large compared to the height @xmath9 , i.e.  in the case of large aspect ratio , @xmath10 . in the experiments  @xcite , however , the fully developed fluid velocity is _ two _ dimensional , i.e.  it depends both on @xmath0 and @xmath5 due to the finite aspect ratios investigated ( @xmath11 )  @xcite . despite this fact ,",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is quite good suggesting that the specific form of the velocity profile does not play a crucial role as long as a linear regime close to the walls and an approximately uniform flow at the channel center can be assumed .    in the present work",
    ", we are going to focus on this aspect via a systematic study of the effect of finite aspect ratio on the spreading dynamics of a tracer field entering the y - junction micromixer through one of the arms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : y - junction ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we solve , via the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite , the full three dimensional advection - diffusion problem for rectangular channels with various aspect ratios .",
    "our previous studies of wall roughness effects on the chaotic mixing of passive tracers in a 2d channel showed the flexibility of the lb method in dealing with advection - diffusion problem in microchannels  @xcite .",
    "the present work extends this approach to 3d with a particular focus on various scaling laws within the _ laminar _ flow regime using smooth walls ( no wall roughness effects ) .    .",
    "the origin of the co - ordinate system is at the middle of the entrance .",
    "measurements are taken after reaching a fully developed flow ]    in addition to a systematic study of the effects related to a finite aspect ratio , our studies differ from numerical calculations of salmon and ajdari in that we do not make any assumption about the shape of the velocity profile . rather , the velocity profile results from the solution of the navier - stokes equations for the problem of interest . by doing this",
    ", we remain as close as possible to real experiments and realize a range of velocity profiles from practically parabolic to those with strong deviations from parabolic dependence .    in the following section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the simulation scheme and also provide some benchmark tests for our lb simulation by comparing our results with known analytical solutions for the spreading of a point source in a 3d microchannel both with and without walls . excellent agreement with the analytical solutions",
    "we then apply in section [ sec : results ] the lb method to study the extent of the inter - diffusion zone between two fluids flowing side by side in a y - shape micromixer .",
    "we study the combined effect of number ( defined as the ratio @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the maximum fluid velocity , @xmath9 the channel height and @xmath14 the diffusion coefficient of the tracer field ) and channel s aspect ratio on the broadening .",
    "our studies include both the upstream zone where the non - uniform broadening along the @xmath0 direction occurs ( with an extent @xmath3 close to the walls and @xmath1 at the center of the channel ) and downstream region where diffusion has had enough time to homogenize the concentration distribution along the vertical @xmath5 direction whereby leading to homogeneous broadening with a one - half power law both at the walls and in the center of the channel .",

    "the lattice boltzmann method  @xcite is a mesoscopic approach that approximately solves the continuum boltzmann equation in a discrete form by dividing space into a regular lattice , time into discrete steps and velocities into a finite number of vectors  @xcite .",

    "it is straight forward to extend the situation to the case of diffusion in a uniform steady unidirectional velocity field @xmath94 .",
    "the results for this situation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lb_and_analytical](b ) for the case of an infinite system ( no walls ) . here",
    ", the point source exhibits a normal diffusive broadening ( @xmath95 ) , while at the same time being advected by the flow .",
    "the analytic curves shown in fig .  [ fig : lb_and_analytical](b ) are flow advected version of gaussian distributions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : green_function ] ) , where @xmath96 is replaced by @xmath97 . noting that the center of the gaussian distribution along the flow direction obeys @xmath98 , the normal diffusive broadening can also be expressed as @xmath99 .",
    "for a number of @xmath100 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] , the cross - sectional image of the concentration field at various axial positions @xmath101 along the channel for aspect ratios of @xmath102 and 5 respectively .",
    "first note that the width of the interdiffusion zone increases with increasing axial distance ( compare panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the role played by time in diffusion process . indeed , recalling that the tracer concentration at a height @xmath5 is advected with the velocity @xmath103 and neglecting the effect of shear for the moment , a rough correspondence between diffusion time and the distance @xmath2 from the inlet can be obtained via @xmath104 .",
    "a larger distance from the inlet thus corresponds to a larger diffusion time .    a survey of fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] allows a second important observation , namely that the extent @xmath6 of interdiffusion zone increases when going from the center of the channel towards the walls , the so called `` butterfly effect '' ( see e.g.  panel ( b ) ) . again , making use of the above estimate of diffusion time as @xmath104 , a qualitative understanding of this behavior can be gained by noting that @xmath103 is maximum at the center of the channel ( @xmath105 ) and decreases to zero at the walls ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "thus , at a given distance @xmath2 from the inlet , the time available for diffusion is larger in the proximity of the walls as compared to the center of the channel .    even though being able to describe some important qualitative features of diffusive broadening , the above argument is too crude to capture the different scaling laws discussed above ( @xmath107 close to the walls as compared to @xmath108 at the channel center ) .",
    "indeed , an argument based only on an estimate of the effective diffusion time would yield @xmath109 .",
    "in other words , one would obtain diffusive broadening with an exponent of @xmath110 for all distances from the wall .",
    "the @xmath5-dependence being reflected in an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath111 . an adequate description of experimental observation , therefore , requires taking into account the effect of the non - uniformity of the flow on tracer distribution .",
    "interestingly , assuming a linear velocity profile seems to be sufficient for a derivation of the observed scaling exponent of @xmath112 close to the walls  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath110 , on the other hand , results from the presence of a quasi - uniform flow in the central region of the channel .    a third important aspect in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] is the effect of aspect ratio . a comparison of the left and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] at a given distance from the inlet clearly shows that the interdiffusion zone is broader in the case of lower aspect ratio . as a consequence , also the inhomogeneity of the tracer concentration field along the @xmath5 direction",
    "is more pronounced when the aspect ratio is decreased .",
    "one could therefore expect that a longer diffusion time is required in order to homogenize the concentration field across the vertical direction .",
    "using the rough correspondence between time and axial distance along the lines discussed above , the position at which the concentration distribution across @xmath5 direction becomes homogeneous should increase for smaller aspect ratios .",
    "a comparison of panels ( c ) and ( f ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] confirms this expectation .",
    "both these panels correspond to the same distance from the inlet but different aspect ratios . while in fig .",
    "[ fig : images](f ) ( aspect ratio=5 ) the solute concentration is already homogeneous along the @xmath5-direction , it exhibits significant inhomogeneity in fig .",
    "[ fig : images](c ) ( aspect ratio=2 ) . an important consequence of this feature will be worked out below .    in order to proceed with a more quantitative analysis",
    ", we adopt a simple definition of the extent of interdiffusion zone @xmath6 as the width of the concentration profile at which the concentration is reduced to 20% of the maximum value at the inlet .",
    "it is to be stressed that the results presented here are insensitive to the specific definition of @xmath6 .",
    "other definitions such as using the integral over the second moment of the spatial derivative of the concentration field , @xmath113 , lead essentially to the same conclusions",
    ". the present simple definition , however , is numerically more robust since it does not require the computation of numerical derivative of the concentration field at discrete intervals .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : method ] , @xmath1 for diffusion in a uniform velocity field . in the case of the inhomogeneous velocity profile considered here ,",
    "the relation between the extent of the broadening @xmath6 and the axial distance @xmath2 takes the more general form @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the exponent characterizing the diffusive broadening .",

    "this latter behavior can be understood by assuming that the cross over from an exponent of @xmath152 to @xmath153 corresponds to a homogeneous tracer distribution along the @xmath5-axis .",
    "a criterion for vertical homogenization via diffusion is obtained from @xmath154 which , using the maximum fluid velocity @xmath13 to estimate the cross over time , @xmath134 , yields the cross over distance @xmath155 . in terms of the reduced distance",
    ", this relation translates to @xmath131  @xcite .",
    "the above estimate of @xmath4 does not take into account the effect of aspect ratio .",
    "in fact , as discussed above , the vertical homogenization takes place at larger axial distances when the aspect ratio is decreased ( compare panels ( f ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] ) . in order to investigate this issue , data in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings ] are plotted for two different aspect ratios of @xmath102 ( upper panels ) and @xmath126 ( lower panels ) .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the panels ( a ) and ( b ) [ as well as ( c ) and ( d ) ] in fig .  [ fig : scalings ] suggests that @xmath4 increases when the aspect ratio is decreased .",
    "the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings ] differ in number investigated .",
    "this is to underline the fact that the observed trend with regard to aspect ratio is not related to the specific choice of the number .    in order to quantify the effect of aspect ratio further , we determine for two aspect ratios of @xmath102 and @xmath126 the values of the exponent @xmath115 for each position @xmath2 and @xmath5 along the channel by performing a running fit on the curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : scalings ] as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents ] . the dotted black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents](a ) indicate concentration boundary layer which grows with the axial distance at a rate @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "the growth of the concentration boundary layer results from the diffusive flux of solute from the top / bottom wall to the center of the channel .",
    "the white area of the plot corresponds to the high exponent region of the channel .",
    "our resolution is limited by the small number of points in the @xmath157 direction .",
    "the difference between the exponents obtained for the two investigated aspect ratios is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : exponents](c ) confirming the retarded cross over to normal diffusive behavior in the case of smaller aspect ratio .    in a more systematic study ,",
    "we varied the aspect ratio from 1 to 20 and determined the cross over distance @xmath4 .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xc ] illustrates the behavior of the thus obtained cross over point within the range of aspect ratios investigated and for different numbers of @xmath158 and @xmath159 . in line with the results presented above",
    ", we observe an increase in the cross over point as the aspect ratio decreases .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xc ] depicts a non - dimensionalized version of the same data .",
    "interestingly , the data for different numbers collapse onto a master curve in the limit of high aspect ratios .",
    "this is an important observation , since it suggests that , in this limit , the effect of number is indeed a mere rescaling of time or axial distance .    in an attempt to better understand the reason for dependence of @xmath4 on aspect ratio , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_and_vprofile](a ) fluid velocity @xmath141 as well as its spatial derivative , @xmath139 , as a function of the transverse coordinate @xmath0 for aspect ratios of @xmath102 and @xmath126 .",
    "the plot is done for a distance of 2 lattice units from the bottom wall . for the aspect ratio of 5",
    ", there is a wide range of @xmath0-values for which both @xmath141 and @xmath142 are roughly constant thus justifying the assumption that @xmath160 ( independent of @xmath0 ) .",
    "this assumption , however , fails at the smaller aspect ratio shown .",
    "the data shown in the right panel of fig .  [ fig : conc_and_vprofile ] further underline the importance of taking into account the dependence of the fluid velocity both on @xmath5 and on @xmath0 when the aspect ratio is small .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : conc_and_vprofile ] suggest that the increase in @xmath4 is probably due to the side wall shear effect on solute distribution . at a lower aspect ratio ,",
    "the shear rate @xmath161 decreases strongly close to the side wall .",
    "an estimate from fig .",
    "[ fig : conc_and_vprofile](a ) shows that for an aspect ratio of 2 , the @xmath161 at position @xmath162 is about 40% less than that at the center of the channel ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "therefore , solute diffusing towards the side walls samples a strongly decreasing shear rate .",
    "given that the extent of broadening @xmath6 at the top / bottom wall takes the form @xmath163 @xcite , the interdiffusion becomes faster when approaching the side walls , whereby enhancing the inhomogeneity of diffusion ( the so called `` butterfly effect '' ) which is already present at infinite aspect ratio .",
    "this is exactly what we observe in the concentration profile images shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] .    in general , solute diffusing towards the side walls from the center of the channel samples constant velocity gradient @xmath161 up to a distance @xmath9 from the side wall .",
    "the time spent by solute before sampling a substantial decrease in the velocity gradient is , therefore , @xmath164 . for @xmath165 ,",
    "this time scale is greater than the time scale to diffuse from the top / bottom wall to the center of the channel denoted as @xmath166 .",
    "thus , at high aspect ratio , solute concentration becomes homogeneous along the vertical direction long before the side walls are `` felt '' . consequently , the cross over point @xmath4 becomes independent of aspect ratio .",
    "in the case where @xmath167 , on the other hand , one can not neglect the additional enhancement of inhomogeneity of diffusive broadening due to the side wall effect .",
    "this leads to @xmath168 for the effect of aspect ratio being significant . as a survey of @xmath169 in fig .",
    "[ fig : xc](b ) reveals , this simple estimate ( which is based on a dimensional argument only ) lies within a factor of two of the result obtained within our computer simulations .",
    "we study the effect of a finite aspect ratio on transverse diffusive transport of miscible solutes flowing in a pressure driven microchannel using the lattice boltzmann method .",
    "the lattice boltzmann method incorporates the essential 3d features such as the non - parabolicity of the velocity profile and the velocity gradient due to the side walls .",
    "we observe the previously reported @xcite different exponents characterizing the extent of the broadening both at the early stage of mixing of the two fluids and at the later stage downstream .",
    "interestingly , we observe the same scaling laws regardless of the channel aspect ratio",
    ". however , extent of diffusive broadening and the position , @xmath4 , at which the broadening becomes uniform and finally reverts to the 1/2 behavior vary remarkably with the channel aspect ratio . the number , on the other hand ,",
    "is found to play the role of a scale factor in @xmath4 in a way that @xmath170 is independent of aspect ratio .",
    "this is inline with the general structure of the advection - diffusion equation , upon neglection of axial diffusion .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the effect of aspect ratio is provided invoking the influence of the shear stress in the proximity of the side walls on diffusive broadening .",
    "this is based on the idea that side wall shear stress is non - negligible in a region of width @xmath9 close to the side walls .",
    "the corresponding effect on inhomogeneous diffusive broadening will be felt if the solutes at the center of the channel have enough time to reach this region _ before _",
    "vertical homogenization takes place .",
    "this allows to derive a simple criterion to decide whether a given aspect ratio is `` large '' or `` small '' . within a factor of two ,",
    "this estimate correctly reproduces the behavior observed within our lattice boltzmann computer simulations",
