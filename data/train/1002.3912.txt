    "one decade has passed since the first long distance sn measurements ( see @xcite for the latest data ) led to the belief in an accelerating expansion of our universe and the postulation of dark energy ( even if the effect is model dependent @xcite and there are some possibilities that do not need acceleration @xcite ) .",
    "there is still no convincing theoretical understanding of the experimental result , and the creativity of theoretical physicists has led to a plethora of proposals on the nature of this new energy component , see e.g. @xcite .    in the same decade , however , initially independent of the development in the dark energy sector , our knowledge about another , long - standing problem in relativistic cosmology has grown to an extent that allowed to connect it to the dark energy problem : the question of how effectively inhomogeneities in matter and geometry would influence the global behavior of the universe @xcite . as general relativity is far too complex to simply solve the einstein equations for an inhomogeneous matter distribution and calculate the effect through tensorial averaging techniques ,",
    "there have been several approaches to get a handle on this problem @xcite .",
    "the one which lies at the basis of this paper was introduced in @xcite and uses a truncated hierarchy of the averaged scalar parts of einstein s equations . as will be recalled in section  [ sub : the - average - einstein ]",
    ", this strategy reduces the problem to a set of three coupled equations for four independent variables characterizing the state of some spatial domain in the universe , its volume , mean density , mean scalar curvature and backreaction , linked to the degree of inhomogeneity of the domain s deformation . for details see sec .",
    "[ sub : the - average - einstein ] and @xcite .",
    "based on this framework the connection of the two above - mentioned problems was made in @xcite and @xcite , where the authors proposed that the backreaction of the inhomogeneities developing in the era of structure formation could lead to the effect interpreted as accelerated expansion .",
    "this would also solve the coincidence problem , i.e. answer the question why the acceleration takes place at a moment of the evolution when the universe leaves its homogeneous initial state .",
    "for this and other more theoretically founded reasons , there have already been some applications of the formalism of the averaged equations to structure formation .",
    "one has been carried out by rsnen @xcite ( generalizing his earlier work on a two  scale model @xcite ) .",
    "he used a model of structure formation in which the extreme points of the initial overdensity field are evolved separately using a spherical ltb model .",
    "his treatment did not give evidence for an accelerated expansion , but he could identify a signal of onset of an eventually strong backreaction regime at the right time . another study that also follows a multiscale approach as in the present paper has been performed by wiltshire @xcite .",
    "he separated the universe model into `` voids '' and `` walls '' and studied the backreaction effects resulting from fluctuations due to this partitioning . to solve the equations he assumed the backreaction term to vanish on each of the subregions and set the curvature on the overdense regions to zero ( as in the two  scale model of rsnen @xcite ) .",
    "for the underdense regions he considered a friedmann  like constant curvature term . under these assumptions",
    "he also did not find volume acceleration , but described an effect that should result from the different lapse of time in underdense void regions and overdense matter dominated regions .",
    "this allowed him to fit his model to a fair number of data @xcite , despite his assumption that the backreaction effect on the individual domains was absent .",
    "we shall come back to his approach later .",
    "other interesting considerations about a multiscale approach to self  gravitating systems may be found in @xcite .",
    "we wish to take one step back and return to the more general problem ( i.e. without using rsnen s or wiltshire s assumptions ) , by presenting the general framework for separations of the averaged equations into subdomains of the universe .",
    "this has been begun in @xcite by investigating a general volume partition of cosmological hypersurfaces .",
    "we will show that this separation is consistently possible also for the evolution equations .",
    "the advantage of not neglecting any effect is impaired by the caveat not to be able to close the system of averaged equations without further assumptions on evolution laws for backreaction and curvature .",
    "we are going to investigate a volume partition of the universe into initially overdense @xmath7regions and underdense @xmath8regions in analogy with wiltshire s approach .",
    "however , instead of setting the backreaction on @xmath7 and @xmath8 to zero , we will first use perturbative results on the early evolution of backreaction @xcite , @xcite : in perturbation theory one finds that the backreaction term on a subdomain of a matter dominated universe model decays only as @xmath9 with the scale factor ( a result found in various papers in relativistic cosmology @xcite that confirms the formally analogous situation for the backreaction term in newtonian cosmology @xcite ) .",
    "the latter work also shows that it is the leading term in a nonperturbative approximation based on the exact averaged equations and the zeldovich approximation @xcite for the fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , this work selects the leading term as the dominant contribution on large ,  quasilinear \" scales .",
    "note here that in some work this leading mode is dismissed due to the property that its coefficient function is a full divergence and must hence vanish by imposing periodic boundary conditions . while this latter remark is true @xcite , the mode is nevertheless there in the interior of a periodic newtonian or quasi ",
    "newtonian simulation box .",
    "moreover , in a proper relativistic theory these terms are not full divergences and there are no boundary conditions to be satisfied apart from the constraints on the initial hypersurface .    as a result of this behavior of the leading mode the importance of the backreaction term , although being a second  order quantity , quickly rises with respect to the matter density which goes as @xmath10 .",
    "this perturbative mode falls on an exact scaling solution @xcite of the general problem and we , hence , consider evolution laws for backreaction and curvature by extrapolation of the perturbative mode along this particular scaling solution .",
    "we emphasize that this extrapolation of the leading perturbative mode already furnishes a nonperturbative model due to the fact that the mode is referred to an evolving background that includes backreaction @xcite , @xcite . as an aside",
    "we here note that a perturbation theory on the evolving background given by the averaged equations has not yet been concisely investigated ; forthcoming work will especially focus on the formulation of such a theory , which will be key to an adequate generalization of perturbation theories in the averaging framework .",
    "our second approach uses the general formalism and is specialized to a concrete model by making use of @xmath4body simulation data and the assumption that backreaction globally acts like a cosmological constant .",
    "this latter approach illustrates a strong backreaction scenario that simultaneously describes accelerated expansion and the structure formation history .",
    "@xmath4body simulation data have recently also been used to estimate the backreaction in a quasi  newtonian setting through an estimation of the post ",
    "newtonian potential @xcite .",
    "we here allow for a more general reinterpretation of newtonian simulations that  combined with the relativistic equations  takes scalar curvature into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : volume - partitions ] shortly reviews the averaged equations and the occurrence of the backreaction terms .",
    "then the relevant separation formulae are presented and the consistency of the resulting evolution equations is checked .",
    "the question of how accelerated expansion may be understood in the context of these equations is addressed in subsection  [ sub : a - first - example ] .",
    "section  [ sec : a - simple - scaling ] uses the assumption of the @xmath9scaling of the backreaction terms to clarify the connection between structures today , the initial density fluctuations and the accelerated expansion .",
    "the comparison of [ sub : comparison ] shows that the specific model is not sufficient to explain structure formation and points out why this could also not have been expected .",
    "the discussion will concentrate on how one has to devise the evolution of inhomogeneities in the context of the averaged equations in order to fully explain the phenomenon of dark energy .",
    "section  [ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] investigates how the perturbative @xmath9behavior has to be extended to combine structure formation and accelerated expansion . in [ sec : power - series]a we motivate the choice of the @xmath9scaling for the backreaction term on @xmath7 and @xmath8 and rederive the results of @xcite , @xcite in our context .",
    "we also perform a quantitative estimation of the amount of initial backreaction necessary for structure formation .",
    "finally , we give quantitative conclusions in [ sec : power - series]b , and discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] what extensions could be made to the models considered and comment on the need for a substantial reinterpretation of observational data .",
    "the basis for our investigation of the link of structure formation to the expansion history of the universe is to consider integral properties of scalar variables in a pressureless  i.e. dust  universe model , given in @xcite , later refined to be applicable to perfect fluid matter models in @xcite , where also compact formulations of the averaged equations of @xcite can be found .",
    "the space time is foliated into flow ",
    "orthogonal hypersurfaces featuring the line ",
    "element @xmath11 where the proper time @xmath12 labels the hypersurfaces and @xmath13 are gaussian normal coordinates ( locating free  falling fluid elements or generalized fundamental observers ) in the hypersurfaces .",
    "@xmath14 is the full inhomogeneous three ",
    "metric of the hypersurfaces of constant proper time .",
    "such a split corresponds in the adm formalism to the choices of a constant lapse and a vanishing shift .",
    "extensions of this formalism to nonvanishing shift and tilted foliations have been given in @xcite and @xcite , in @xcite with applications to perturbation theory . for considerations of covariance and gauge issues",
    "see @xcite .    on these hypersurfaces",
    "we want to study the evolution of compact spatial domains @xmath15 , comoving with the fluid .",
    "this latter property ensures that the domain is frozen into the general three ",
    "metric , i.e. its shape encodes the geometrical structure of the local inhomogeneities .",
    "note that in newtonian spacetimes it can be shown that the morphology of the boundary of a comoving domain already contains comprehensive information of the matter distribution , including all higher  order correlations .",
    "the morphology  characterizing set of integral geometrical measures is known as the minkowski functionals , from which the backreaction term can be built ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "one fundamental quantity characterizing such a domain is its volume , which is the only such measure used here , since we wish to address questions related to the size of the domains and its time  derivatives only , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . from the domain s volume",
    "one may define a scale factor @xmath18 encoding the average stretch of all directions of the domain .",
    "for wild changes of the shape of the initial domain @xmath19 one might want to know more about the evolution of other morphological characteristics to deduce directional expansion information , and would therefore have to extend the analysis .",
    "concentrating on the volume and the effective scale factor alone , one can derive , from the einstein equations with a pressureless fluid source , the following set of equations governing its evolution : @xmath20 where the average over scalar quantities is defined as @xmath21 and where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the local matter density , the ricci scalar of the three ",
    "metric @xmath14 , and the domain dependent hubble rate @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the kinematical backreaction @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the local expansion rate and @xmath29 is the squared rate of shear .",
    "note that @xmath24 is defined as @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath26 is composed of the variance of the local expansion rates , @xmath31 , and the averaged shear scalar @xmath32 on the domain under consideration . for a homogeneous domain it is zero .",
    "it therefore encodes the departure from homogeneity and is supposed to be particularly important in the late , inhomogeneous phase of the universe at the epoch of structure formation .",
    "the integrability condition connecting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) and ( [ eq : hamilton - mittel ] ) reads @xmath33 which already shows an important feature of the averaged equations as they in general couple the evolution of the backreaction term , and hence extrinsic curvature inhomogeneities ( or in this picture matter inhomogeneities ) , to the average intrinsic curvature . unlike in the case of a standard friedmannian evolution the curvature term here",
    "is not restricted to an @xmath34 scaling behavior but is dynamical in the sense that it may be an arbitrary function of @xmath35 .",
    "we emphasize that the essential effect of backreaction models is not a large magnitude of @xmath26 , but a dynamical coupling of a nonvanishing @xmath26 to the averaged scalar curvature , changing the temporal behavior of this latter .",
    "one may also define cosmological parameters on the domain investigated .",
    "in analogy to the friedmannian case they are derived from the hamilton constraint ( [ eq : hamilton - mittel ] ) by a division by @xmath36 . for different spatial domains , which will be denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", we formulate the cosmological parameters in a generic way by taking @xmath37 to denote one of the domains @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( this will hold for the whole text , but depending on the context @xmath37 may also only denote @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the definitions are @xmath38 where the decision to divide by @xmath39 for every @xmath37 will become clear from the definition of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath15 in the next section . using those definitions , the hamilton constraint ( [ eq : hamilton - mittel ] ) for a domain @xmath37 reads @xmath40 which means that the dimensionless parameters @xmath41 only add up to @xmath42 for the domain @xmath15 . on other domains",
    "they may add up to a more or less arbitrary positive value , depending on whether the corresponding region @xmath37 expands faster or slower than the @xmath15 region .",
    "to point out the analogy with the @xmath43 friedmann equations one may recast ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel])-([eq : konservation - mittel ] ) combining the backreaction and the curvature terms to an effective density and pressure : @xmath44 where the effective densities are defined as @xmath45 in this sense , @xmath26 and @xmath46 may be combined to some kind of dark fluid component that is commonly referred to as @xmath47matter .",
    "one quantity characterizing this @xmath47matter is its equation of state @xmath48 which is an effective one due to the fact that backreaction and curvature give rise to an _ effective _ energy density and pressure .      after the short review of the averaging formalism we present in the following how the resulting equations can be separated , if one wants to consider the behavior of subdomains of some `` global '' region @xmath15 , which we may assume to be associated with a ( postulated ) scale of homogeneity .",
    "we consider , a priori , arbitrary partitions of the spatial hypersurfaces into subregions @xmath49 , which themselves consist of elementary space entities @xmath50 that may be associated with some averaging length scale .",
    "the idea will be to choose entities @xmath50 in a way that they share some common properties . in our case",
    "this property will be the value of the overdensity field , but the separation is general and also valid for other choices . to be more precise we want to have @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the sequel",
    "we follow closely the investigation in @xcite of a general volume partitioning of cosmological hypersurfaces .    the average of the scalar valued function @xmath56 on the domain @xmath15",
    ", @xmath57 defined in ( [ eq : def - mittel ] ) , where @xmath58 denotes its volume @xmath59 , may then be split into the averages of @xmath56 on the subregions @xmath49 , in the form @xmath60 where we have introduced @xmath61 i.e. the volume fraction @xmath62 of the subregion @xmath49 .",
    "regarding the dynamical equations we wish to separate , i.e. ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) , ( [ eq : hamilton - mittel ] ) and ( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) , equation ( [ eq : split ] ) directly provides the expressions for the scalar functions @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath63 . only @xmath26",
    "as defined in ( [ eq : def - q ] ) does not split in this simple way due to the @xmath64term .",
    "a short calculation rather provides @xmath65 as the correct formula .",
    "@xmath66 is defined as in ( [ eq : def - q ] ) with @xmath49 instead of @xmath15 .",
    "the shear part @xmath67 is completely absorbed in @xmath66 , whereas the variance of the local expansion rates , @xmath31 , is partly contained in @xmath66 but also generates the extra term @xmath68 .",
    "this is because the part of the variance that is present in @xmath66 , namely @xmath69 , only takes into account points inside @xmath49 . to restore the variance that comes from combining points of @xmath49 with others in @xmath70 , the extra term containing the averaged hubble rates emerges .",
    "one may also define a scale factor @xmath71 analogous to ( [ eq : scale - factor ] ) for each of the subregions @xmath49 . as their definition implies that they are disjoint",
    ", it follows that @xmath72 and we may therefore define @xmath73 .",
    "an important detail when using the equation in this form is that , at the initial time when @xmath35 is equal to one , the scale factors @xmath71 of the subregions will not be equal to one as well .",
    "this different normalization has to be taken into account when scaling the local @xmath7 and @xmath8 parameters .",
    "differentiating @xmath73 twice with respect to the foliation time and using the result for @xmath74 , we finally provide the relation that links the acceleration of the scale factors of the subdomains to the global one : @xmath75 as an immediate consequence one can see that even when the subregions decelerate , the second term of ( [ eq : acc - split ] ) may counterbalance the first one to lead to global accelerated expansion .",
    "we will examine this property , which appears generically in averaged models due to correlations of local expansion rates , in appendix [ sub : a - first - example ] .",
    "in the following we will be mainly considering the case where we have only two types of subregions @xmath49 : over and underdense regions .",
    "we will define them at some initial time and call @xmath76 the part of the hypersurfaces that consist of all elementary regions @xmath77 with an initial overdensity and @xmath78 the complementary part @xmath79 , i.e. the one with the initially underdense regions .",
    "the formulae ( [ eq : split ] ) and ( [ eq : q - split ] ) then simplify to give @xmath80 with the same expression valid also for @xmath81 and @xmath46 , and @xmath82 in both cases we used @xmath83 , which results from the fact that the @xmath49 are disjoint , and defined @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this general separation formula allows us to illustrate the simplifications applied by wiltshire in his two  scale model @xcite . as he assumes the overdense @xmath7regions to have no curvature , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) the only possible nonzero @xmath86term would have a strongly decaying @xmath87behavior and may therefore equally well be set to zero . for the underdense @xmath8regions",
    "the situation is similar as he assumes them to have the friedmann ",
    "like @xmath88 constant curvature term .",
    "this again makes the left  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) vanish and leads to the choice of @xmath89 .",
    "this reduces the general formula ( [ eq : partqd ] ) to its third term on the right  hand side , which corresponds to his eq .",
    "( 31 ) in @xcite , that he derived for the case of vanishing shear .",
    "this is consistent , as we remarked below ( [ eq : q - split ] ) , because the shear term of @xmath26 is completely contained in @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",
    "considering the overall formalism his choice is conservative in the sense that one would indeed expect the biggest backreaction effect to stem from the variance of the expansion rates between the @xmath7 and @xmath8regions and not from those on @xmath7 and @xmath8 themselves , as they are chosen to have similar properties and therefore similar expansion rates . on the other hand , setting the local backreaction to zero restricts the new interesting feature of the averaging formalism , i.e. the coupling of backreaction to curvature , to the @xmath15regions only .",
    "furthermore , as we argue in subsection  [ sub : numerical - example ] , it may be eligible to allow for shear on the @xmath7regions , which may ( and will ) imply a negative @xmath86 ( i.e. , a dark matter behavior over @xmath7 )",
    ". we will therefore not restrict ourselves to the assumptions of constant curvature , but use other well  motivated conditions in section  [ sec : a - simple - scaling ] .      with the knowledge of the relation between the quantities on the subregions with those on the global domain @xmath15 , one may now ask , how the separation affects the evolution equations for those quantities . therefore , we insert the expressions ( [ eq : split ] ) for @xmath24 , @xmath81 and @xmath46 and ( [ eq : q - split ] ) for @xmath26 into ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) , ( [ eq : hamilton - mittel ] ) and ( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the equations take the following form : @xmath91 \\label{eq : ham - allgemein - separiert}\\\\ 0 & = & \\sum_{\\ell}\\lambda_{\\ell}\\left[-4\\pi g\\left\\langle \\varrho\\right\\rangle _ { \\ell}+{{{\\cal q}}}_{\\ell}+\\lambda-3\\frac{\\ddot{a}_{\\ell}\\left(t\\right)}{a_{\\ell}\\left(t\\right)}\\right ] \\label{eq : ray - allgemein - separiert}\\\\ 0 & = & \\sum_{\\ell}\\lambda_{\\ell}\\left[a_{\\ell}^{-2}\\partial_{t}\\left(a_{\\ell}^{2}\\left\\langle { { \\cal r}}\\right\\rangle _ { \\ell}\\right)+a_{\\ell}^{-6}\\partial_{t}\\left(a_{\\ell}^{6}{{\\cal q}}_{\\ell}\\right)\\right]\\ ; , \\label{eq : int - cond - allgemein - separiert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. they may be split into a sum in which the equations on the subregions take the same form as those of the global region ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel])([eq : konservation - mittel ] ) and their contribution is weighted with the volume fraction of the respective subregion . as equations ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel])([eq : konservation - mittel ] ) hold for an arbitrary domain @xmath15 and therefore also for the subregions @xmath49 , equations ( [ eq : ham - allgemein - separiert])([eq : int - cond - allgemein - separiert ] ) show that the separation advocated in the previous section is also consistent at the level of the evolution equations .",
    "this is not surprising as the separation procedure is straightforward and the equations are supposed to hold on any domain , but was , especially in view of the nonlinear form of ( [ eq : q - split ] ) , not entirely clear when just looking at the formulas .",
    "the consistent split assures that , if we have found a solution for the quantities on the subregions @xmath49 and use the relations of the previous section to calculate those on the global domain , then we will automatically obtain a solution of the averaged equations ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel])([eq : konservation - mittel ] ) on this global domain .",
    "after setting up the equations that link different subregions of a certain partitioning of space to the whole in the preceding section , we will now have a closer look at the simplest partitioning . as already mentioned at the end of [ sub : separation - formulae ] , we are interested in a subdivision into over and underdense regions",
    ". these will be labeled by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and the classification is made at some initial time and then kept fixed . as the averaged equations are derived for a certain region @xmath49 , that is assumed to keep its identity , an exchange of elementary space entities @xmath50 between the two classes of regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 would spoil the applicability of ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel])([eq : konservation - mittel ] ) on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and therefore would lead to some complicated modified form which would introduce even more unknown parameters .",
    "this is the reason for keeping the identification of @xmath49regions , even if this will introduce some problems with the clearcut interpretation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for initially overdense regions may become underdense in the course of evolution .",
    "a refined description that helps to evade this problem will be mentioned in the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the motivation of distinguishing between the @xmath7 and @xmath8classes of regions is to get an explicit handle on structure formation .",
    "implicitly it is already present in the averaging formalism mainly via the @xmath92term in the kinematical backreaction defined by ( [ eq : def - q ] ) . as structure formation implies a different evolution of the local expansion rate at different places in the universe ,",
    "this variance is expected to grow .",
    "the distinction now offers the possibility to examine the development of parts that are in the focus of experimental interest , namely `` voids '' ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) and clusters of galaxies .",
    "moreover , it allows us to trace the process of structure formation by the simplest parameter characterizing its history , i.e. the volume fraction of the overdense regions .",
    "the current section presents the outcome of this investigation for the special case of exact scaling solutions .      as we have seen in section  [ sub : the - average - einstein ] , the averaged equations do not form a closed system .",
    "one closure strategy is to impose a specific equation of state .",
    "this is similar to closing the friedmannian equations , but here the equation of state is dynamical . as done in quintessence models for the @xmath47matter content inserted as source into the standard friedmann equations ,",
    "the simplest assumption is to choose a constant equation of state parameter @xmath93 .",
    "this means that we have a single scaling law for the corresponding matter component .",
    "if we proceed in a similar way for the backreaction and curvature terms in the averaged equations , we may choose ( following @xcite ) : @xmath94 where @xmath37 stands for @xmath7 or @xmath8 and where @xmath95 indicates the initial state of the domain @xmath37 . by the integrability condition ( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are related . inserting the above",
    "ansatz leads to two types of solutions : first , there is a solution with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this one is not very interesting as this is the only case where the generic coupling of backreaction and curvature is absent .",
    "this case would correspond to fluctuation histories that are decoupled from a constant  curvature ( friedmann  like ) behavior .",
    "second , ( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) will be satisfied if @xmath100 .",
    "this is the case we are going to study in the following .",

    "this choice is , that li and schwarz @xcite found , in a calculation using second  order perturbation theory , that the backreaction term may be expressed as a laurent series with a leading term going like @xmath107 .",
    "we will rederive this behavior , under similar conditions as in their case , in section  [ sec : power - series ] .",
    "there we also argue that the leading term of the scalar curvature , going like @xmath108 is expected to vanish for plausible initial conditions .",
    "we will show that extrapolating the @xmath107behavior up to today runs into trouble and that higher terms in the series are expected to make an important contribution at the epoch of structure formation .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath107 scaling solution provides a first and simple example of why one would expect that backreaction through structure formation might cause accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "we may argue that we did not have to rely on assumptions on the effective equation of state , if we exploited the knowledge of structure formation further .",
    "such an attempt runs into problems as we do not have an inhomogeneous relativistic metric model at our disposal that would cover the details of nonlinear structure formation . on large scales",
    "we probably understand what is happening , but we are already using this information by the known @xmath107 scaling behavior on these scales . in the late universe with",
    "density contrasts of order @xmath42 , the closest to a realistic model at present is the one by rsnen @xcite .",
    "but also this has to rely on some unrealistic assumptions .",
    "we therefore try to derive the equation of state from the n  body simulation of structure formation in our second approach in section  [ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] , where we use the knowledge on nonlinear structure formation encoded in the volume fraction of the simulation .      in order to derive the evolution of the global domain @xmath15 under the assumption of the @xmath107scaling behavior for @xmath7 and @xmath8",

    "to specify these and the other free parameters , namely @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath1 , @xmath113 and @xmath116  with the index @xmath117 denoting the value of today  we have to make some further assumptions .",
    "one is that the density fluctuations in the early universe around @xmath118 , where we choose our initial time @xmath119 , were gaussian and very small as indicated by the results of the cmb experiments . for our parameters",

    "even if it is not a priori clear that the domain dependent @xmath2 of the averaged equations should have the same value as the @xmath139 parameter whose value is determined from the data under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe model , this is the only thing we can do before the analysis of observations in the context of the averaged model , begun in @xcite , is completed . in this spirit",
    "we will use for @xmath1 some reasonable value derived from a @xmath4body simulation of large  scale structure formation .",
    "these are in our context not the best sources of data either , as they are newtonian and therefore do not include scalar curvature being a major player in the averaged equations .",
    "the reason why we think that the value of the parameter @xmath1 is nevertheless derivable from them , is first , that they are designed in a way to match best today s universe and secondly , that , for the calculation of the volume , even a substantial curvature deviation from a euclidean space does not change the value very much .",
    "this is because the calculation of volumes is performed with the metric and its spatial derivatives that are linked to curvature do not enter in the comoving foliation used here ( see @xcite for clarifying remarks on that point ) .",

    "we see that for the region where we have ample sn data , i.e. around a redshift of @xmath42 , the difference between our model and the @xmath5cdm model is less than 5% .",
    "considering the evolution of @xmath148 and @xmath149 we find that they behave as one would expect from their nature .",

    "( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) that @xmath152 has to be less than @xmath153 to give accelerated expansion .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of @xmath154 underlines the statement that curvature is an important player in our model .",
    "the combination of these two facts has an interesting consequence : if , even for a small but nonzero backreaction parameter , the average scalar curvature parameter is of order @xmath42 , and therefore the actual matter parameter @xmath155 is small , the model may explain dark energy without a large amount of backreaction .",
    "a small @xmath152 larger than @xmath153 does , however , not explain an accelerated expansion , but this latter property may actually not be needed to explain observations .",

    "this is what one would expect due to the fact that they contain many gravitationally bound systems like clusters .",
    "another observation that coincides with the intuitive picture we have , is the fact , that the backreaction contribution is negative [ note again the sign in the definition ( [ eq : def - omega - parameter ] ) ] . according to definition ( [ eq : def - q ] )",

    "this comparison illustrates , that even if the early universe is in a near to homogeneous state , where one can apply perturbation theory , the late universe can look strongly different by the effect of the leading order perturbative @xmath107mode alone .",
    "when higher order growing terms of their laurent series play an important role , or when nonperturbative terms enter due to a substantial injection of backreaction at the stage of nonlinear structure formation , the situation will even become more different . as this comparison shows",

    "the fit may even be improved if one allows for a weak scale dependence of @xmath2 , as for @xmath196 the small scales are fitted in an exquisite manner and for @xmath197 this is true for the large scale evolution .",
    "if this is just a coincidence or if this points to a deeper physical interpretation of the backreaction effect in terms of its capability to unify dark energy and dark matter in one effective fluid can not be finally decided from this investigation .",
    "it is clear that the backreaction terms imply the emergence of both dark components , however , in an entangled way that does not allow us to assign dark matter to over  dense and dark energy to underdense regions uniquely due to the changing variance between the two types of regions .",
    "we may speculate that , in the course of a reinterpretation of observations in the context of the averaged equations , the role of dark matter in structure formation on large and intermediate scales might be attributed to average curvature and backreaction components that effectively yield the same distribution of visible matter as cdm  models ( but see the constraining remarks of sec .",

    "but it may also be that a low value of @xmath194 turns out to be incompatible with other observations .",

    "apart from observational issues the model has to be compared to n  body simulations with baryonic and neutrino content only in order to quantitatively support this necessarily speculative aspect of our model .",
    "a naive interpretation of the low@xmath2 model also runs into the same difficulties of high initial amplitudes of perturbations as in the old studies of baryonic universe models .",
    "furthermore , since independent evidence for dark matter exists @xcite , especially on small scales and unlike the situation for dark energy , we can not conclude from this work that dark matter may be fully identified with backreaction effects .",
    "but , our study clearly indicates the need to exploit this aspect of the backreaction effect",
    ".      it may be helpful to hold in for a moment and put into perspective what we have seen in this section .",
    "it has been shown that in a model that possesses the @xmath107limiting behavior of the backreaction components and that starts from almost homogeneous initial conditions as in the standard model , the simple fact that there is a lot of structure today in terms of volume dominance of devoid regions ( manifesting itself in our model through a value of @xmath0 around @xmath198 ) implies some @xmath5like accelerated expansion of the volume scale factor @xmath35 . even though this model is too basic as is indicated by the discrepancy seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : skalierung - von - q ] , it clearly illustrates the way in which one would expect backreaction to act .",
    "( here we do not want to over  emphasize the result that a pure baryonic matter content would even do the job . ) to avoid the impression that we just replaced the mysterious dark energy component by some other mysterious component , i.e. the backreaction term , let us emphasize the different physical situation . in the general relativistic framework that lies at the basis of the averaged equations the emergence of structure is associated with a geometrical deformation of the underlying spacetime . in the comoving time ",
    "synchronous slicing chosen to describe the dust universe of [ sub : the - average - einstein ] , there is no movement of matter particles with respect to the space .",
    "all inhomogeneities emerge from the distortions of space itself .",
    "this results in the emergence of intrinsic curvature of the spatial hypersurface , reflected in the three ricci scalar @xmath23 , as well as extrinsic curvature of this same hypersurface .",
    "this extrinsic curvature is what makes up the backreaction as it has been shown that it may be defined instead of kinematical quantities as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - q ] ) , in terms of invariants of the extrinsic scalar curvature ( see @xcite ) . to gain some intuition",
    "it may be helpful to see equation ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) not in an active sense stating that there is some fundamental component that forces the scale factor to accelerate , but rather in a passive sense that it traces the complex evolution resulting from the full einstein equations with the only active component being the perfect fluid dust matter .",
    "then one may picture the evolution to be governed by gravitational instability that causes inhomogeneities to grow , which manifest itself in extrinsic curvature showing up in the backreaction term , but also  and this is the key issue  in intrinsic curvature of space in which structures emerge . how acceleration in this context may be understood will be discussed in appendix [ sub : a - first - example ] .    in this general ",
    "relativistic picture one may also see that , even without a cosmological constant , we have some kind of `` dark energy '' in our model universe that now has a clear physical interpretation : it is the curvature energy of the spatial hypersurface , communicated by an effective potential energy in the morphon field correspondence of backreaction @xcite .",
    "this new kind of `` dark energy '' therefore necessarily emerges when structure forms and it is this `` dark energy '' the title of this paper is referring to .",
    "having emphasized the role of intrinsic curvature one can not argue that this picture should yield the same results as the newton  inspired picture of structure forming in space and matter moving around .",
    "if the averaged intrinsic curvature evolves differently as compared with a constant curvature model  and this is a generic outcome of the fact that the kinematical backreaction term and the averaged scalar curvature are coupled  then curvature plays a substantial role for the structure formation history , but also for the interpretation of observational data . while metrical deviations from a flat space may be small",

    "we will explore where this comes from and rederive this behavior in our present context of the partitioning into two subregions .",
    "we first present the result in the form of a proposition :    [ [ proposition ] ] proposition + + + + + + + + + + +    for every evolving spacetime that possesses a flat einstein  de sitter limit at the beginning of its evolution , the backreaction and curvature dependence on the volume scale factor @xmath243 on arbitrary subregions @xmath37 stemming from a metric ",

    "we achieve this by the assumption of a flat matter dominated initial universe model that leads to @xmath248 to connect @xmath148 to @xmath35 we use the relation @xmath249 and expand @xmath0 with a small parameter @xmath250 around @xmath251 which gives @xmath252 where we have defined @xmath253 and @xmath254 as @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "a prime stands for a derivative with respect to the argument and @xmath257 is denoted as @xmath258 .",
    "differentiating ( [ eq : entwicklung - lambda-2o ] ) with respect to time gives @xmath259 and @xmath260 . using ( [ eq : eds - scaling ] )",
    "we find @xmath261 and @xmath262 , which leads to the finally necessary @xmath246 and @xmath247 by an inversion of ( [ eq : entwicklung - lambda-2o ] ) .",
    "this provides @xmath263 and therefore proves the proposition if we take into account that the expansion ( [ eq : entwicklung - lambda-2o ] ) may be extended to arbitrary order .",
    "the third and fourth  order terms of @xmath86 are @xmath264 and all higher  order terms may be calculated in a straightforward way , but have increasingly complicated coefficients . by equation  ( [ eq : integrability - curv ] ) , @xmath227 and @xmath228",
    "are linked and the terms @xmath265 of @xmath228 are the same as those for @xmath227 simply multiplied by @xmath266 . for the second  order term",
    "this may be seen in ( [ eq : q - loesung - stoerung ] ) and ( [ eq : r - loesung - stoerung ] ) where @xmath267 . for the third and fourth  order terms above one",
    "arrives at @xmath228 when multiplying the third  order term with @xmath268 and the fourth  order one with @xmath269 .",
    "these results show why we had to include the condition of a different evolution of the subregions .",
    "if they expand in the same manner , the ratio @xmath0 stays constant which means that @xmath270 and therefore @xmath271 .",
    "another way to phrase it is , that there is no backreaction in a completely homogeneous universe .",
    "but if there are structures developing at any scale , we will have a nonvanishing backreaction term and it will go as @xmath107 in a matter dominated era .",
    "two remarks are in order here .",
    "first we want to emphasize that the result of equations  ( [ eq : q - loesung - stoerung ] ) and ( [ eq : r - loesung - stoerung ] ) coincides with what has been found by li and schwarz @xcite in second  order cosmic perturbation theory .",
    "they also found that on a region @xmath15 on a flat matter dominated background the backreaction term is of second order and scales as @xmath163 .",
    "the third  order term is a ( cosmological ) constant .",
    "second , we want to explore what the result means quantitatively for the initial backreaction . for simplicity let us first take the fit to the @xmath4body simulation data of section  [ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] .",
    "for the functional form ( [ eq : fitfunktion - lambda ] ) we obtain @xmath272 and we may derive the expansion coefficients to be @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",
    "the first observation is that @xmath273 causes the @xmath108 term of the averaged scalar curvature @xmath97 to be zero . in view of the definition of @xmath253 below eq .",
    "( [ eq : entwicklung - lambda-2o ] ) it becomes clear that this is the case whenever @xmath275 .",
    "this means that , if the difference between the subregions at the beginning is not very important so that they evolve initially in a similar way , the term that evolves as a constant curvature term in a flrw model with @xmath108 will be vanishing , provided the background does not have a constant curvature term by itself .",
    "if we demand that the initial matter densities are similar on all the subregions @xmath276 , we find to leading order @xmath277 which gives the initial value of the backreaction compared to the initial matter density .",
    "this relation is interesting since it encodes the relation between the evolution of structure in the universe and the initial value of the backreaction term . in ( [ eq : fitfunktion - lambda ] ) @xmath278 characterizes the rate at which the @xmath7regions decouple from the common evolution of the subregions . for a larger @xmath250 ,",
    "@xmath0 decreases more rapidly .",
    "this faster evolution requires a bigger initial amount of backreaction as it encodes the inhomogeneities that force the system to deviate from the initial near to homogeneous state .",
    "the larger the inhomogeneities are , the faster this deviation takes place .    to give a quantitative estimate we will however use a slightly different fitting function than ( [ eq : fitfunktion - lambda ] ) that is adopted to the shape of @xmath204 on a larger range of scales",
    "we analyze to this end the @xmath4body data provided by @xcite with a mesh of varying grid size .",
    "the result are the data points of the left graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "they are shown together with a fit using the two parameter model @xmath279 where @xmath280 is determined by the requirement that @xmath204 is flat for @xmath183 .",
    "the form of this function is motivated in appendix [ sub : a - simple - mesh ] .",
    "an interesting outcome from this figure is that it confirms the idea that @xmath0 may be a good parameter characterizing the formation of structure .",
    "this is because the different scales evolve differently as expected from the hierarchical formation of structure . on small scales ,",
    "e.g. for @xmath281 , @xmath0 has already dropped to half of its initial value at a redshift of approximately @xmath282 . for scales of @xmath283",
    "this happens only at @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , we recover at least qualitatively the fact that structures start forming at small scales and only then assemble to bigger ones .    using an expansion of the form ( [ eq : entwicklung - fitfunktion ] ) and the general form of ( [ eq : qi - simple ] ) @xmath285 we finally derive the initial abundances of the @xmath286 backreaction term that are shown on the right  hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "we have evaluated grid lengths from @xmath287 .",
    "the line of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] indicating an @xmath288behavior of the scale dependence shows that in our evaluation of the @xmath4body structure formation there seems to be a discrepancy with results from @xcite , where the authors found that the values for the backreaction term as derived from the power spectrum should scale as @xmath289 with the length scale @xmath290 . in their case",
    ", however , they used a pure harrison ",
    "zeldovich spectrum scaling as @xmath291 to derive this result . for a more realistic cdm power spectrum , the small ",
    "scale behavior is rather @xmath292 which in turn means that the spatial dependence changes from @xmath289 to @xmath288 .",
    "the region that we could evaluate with scales up to @xmath293 ( top hat ) , is in this small  scale regime",
    ". it would be interesting to evaluate a bigger simulation to go beyond this scale and to see the change in the scaling behavior of the backreaction term .",
    "quantitatively , the percentage of initial backreaction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ranges from @xmath294 depending on the scale ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ) .",
    "these specific values show that backreaction is indeed perturbatively small in the quasihomogeneous epoch of the universe . on large scales",
    "it seems insufficient to change the overall behavior as indicated by the value of @xmath295 on the scale of the horizon , found for example in the perturbative calculation of @xcite . on the scale of structures ,",
    "however , this perturbative contribution grows with respect to the matter content due to its @xmath107scaling and is sufficient to lead to the diverse structures we see in today s universe .",
    "let us discuss what we have seen in this paper .",
    "section  [ sec : volume - partitions ] showed that a consistent split of the dynamical equations governing the averaged universe model is possible .",
    "this split also allows , in appendix [ sub : a - first - example ] , to shed light on the property of the volume scale factor to show accelerated expansion , even in a case where there was no acceleration in the evolution of its components .",
    "the split of the equations enabled us to construct an averaged universe model without having to know the initial magnitude of backreaction .",
    "instead this latter follows from the strength of structure formation that we put in in the form of today s volume fraction @xmath0 of the initially overdense regions @xmath7 .",
    "this model implies that the volume scale factor @xmath35 evolves quite similarly to the scale factor in a flat friedmann model with about 70% cosmological constant .",
    "an obvious shortcoming of this model is a mismatch with the actual time ",
    "evolution of the best ",
    "fit volume fraction with that predicted by the @xmath4body data . surprisingly , this mismatch disappears neatly , if we reinterpret the fundamental dark matter fraction in the matter parameter by the backreaction effect , leaving only the baryon content as fundamental .",
    "we do not want , however , to emphasize this result , since the dark matter issue has to be investigated much beyond our simple model .",
    "having found that there may be more to the evolution of @xmath96 than just extrapolating the perturbative @xmath107behavior , we investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] how to connect structure formation and accelerated expansion within a strong backreaction scenario . by globally imposing the particular scaling solution that mimics a cosmological constant and by assuming the structure formation history of a newtonian @xmath4body simulation , the initial @xmath107limit on the subdomains",
    "is obtained , but this also provided a nonperturbative extension of the @xmath96scaling to later times .",
    "the emergence of the @xmath107scaling was then closer investigated in sec .",
    "[ sec : power - series ] where it became clear that it is generic for any matter dominated universe model that starts out close to homogeneity .",
    "this also confirmed that our choice to invoke the @xmath107behavior on the evolution on @xmath7 and @xmath8 instead of @xmath15 was the right one .",
    "we could instead have identified our @xmath15region with the one that li and schwarz looked at , but section  [ sec : power - series ] showed that our @xmath15region corresponds rather to their background .",
    "finally , we showed that if the universe may be described by the average equations and we require it to have the structure we see today , this means that the backreaction component has to be of the order of @xmath294 ( as compared to the matter density and depending on the scale one is considering ) in the initial near to homogeneous phase that may be treated by perturbation theory . in the later nonperturbative stages of the evolution of the universe , this tiny initial fraction is sufficient to give rise to structures and inhomogeneities that we see in the recent epoch .",
    "a striking result of this work is the fact that both complementary scenarios lead to qualitatively similar evolution laws for the backreaction terms on the largest scales , while the models only differ in the details , e.g. in the concrete form of the structure formation histories and in the behavior of the variables on @xmath7regions .",
    "since the assumptions underlying these two scenarios are quite orthogonal , we are confident that the @xmath107scaling behavior at early stages of backreaction evolution on the subdomains ( imposed in the first scenario and derived from the latter ) should be close to the actual physical evolution that has to be confirmed by future investigations of perturbation theory on an evolving background and by nonperturbative models that contain exact solutions as limiting cases .",
    "one out of a number of problems that remain is to give a clearcut interpretation of the quantities calculated in terms of observables .",
    "as we argued it is difficult to link the initially underdense @xmath8regions directly to today s voids as one might wish to . to bypass this ambiguity one could imagine to extend the analysis to three regions @xmath7 , @xmath296 , and @xmath8 where one could choose which overdensity they possess .",
    "it would be natural to consider as @xmath7regions the ones with overdensities of typical clusters , the @xmath8regions with those of voids and put all the astrophysically unspectacular rest into the @xmath296regions .",
    "the advantage of probably being able to give a more refined meaning to for example the @xmath41parameters is , however , counterbalanced by the inconvenience to have to introduce another parameter in the scaling model or even a free function @xmath297 in the general case .",
    "first results along the lines of the scaling of section  [ sec : a - simple - scaling ] and the fit of section  [ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] have been obtained in @xcite , but further analysis would be needed to find out whether the identification is possible and if it is therefore worthwhile to go this way .",
    "a further refinement of the presented model would be to give up the preservation of the identity of the initially characterized subregions . whether this is necessary could be checked through a detailed analysis of n  body simulations .",
    "as our model is effective one could think of implementing reaction rates between over and underdense regions in the spirit of nonequilibrium transitions in chemical reactions .",
    "a mass  action law could be devised that governs an equilibrium state between elementary subregions in which the reaction rates are equal but nonvanishing , and the transition laws could be determined as done in nonequilibrium chemical reactions ( details of such an approach in the cosmological context may be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we shall , however , first investigate other models that are based on relativistic lagrangian perturbations , generalizing the newtonian nonperturbative model investigated in @xcite .",
    "this systematic attempt  that is currently in preparation  will provide the first generic relativistic evolution model for structure formation , including the spacetime metric for implementing observables as measured along the light cone .",

    "this property of averaged models often leads to confusion so it may be worthwhile to give a simple example , in which one can understand intuitively its origin , and then recap some arguments of the literature for the general case .",
    "one popular paper that gave rise to the confusion is , for example , @xcite .",
    "apart from the acceleration issue discussed in this section , it also postulates the negligibility of backreaction effects due to the applicability of the post ",
    "newtonian metric .",
    "the reasons of why this argument is false , are by now given in various papers in the literature , e.g. @xcite .",
    "let us consider the setup of fig .",
    "[ fig : einfaches - modell - besch ] , where we have identified two distinct regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 .     and a massive shell @xmath7 .",
    "the void in the middle expands in the sequel due to its negative curvature .",

    "the void in the middle expands in the sequel due to its negative curvature .",
    "the shell does not expand any more as it contains only a virialized matter configuration .",
    "this leads to the final state depicted on the right where the void volume is dominating and the matter regions have been stretched and decreased in thickness . in between , the expansion of the total radius @xmath35 experiences an acceleration as is argued in the text.[fig : einfaches - modell - besch],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=24.0% ]    the spherical @xmath8region in the middle is assumed to be devoid of matter and to expand only due to its negative curvature .",
    "the shell however is assumed to be matter dominated and virialized such that the net expansion rate @xmath157 is zero .",
    "this means that the volume of the @xmath7 region is constant , i.e. @xmath298 , and that @xmath299 .",
    "let us consider the case when @xmath300 is also vanishing which leads with ( [ eq : acc - split ] ) to @xmath301 as long as the inner region keeps expanding we will also have acceleration of the global expansion , even if none of the two regions themselves accelerate . in our case",
    "this can be understood as a volume effect .",
    "as @xmath302 , @xmath303 is constant and therefore the growth in radius within a time interval @xmath304 is @xmath305 and also constant .",
    "that this does not result in a constant expansion rate for the total radius @xmath35 is due to the condition that the volume of @xmath7 is constant . with an increasing inner radius ,",
    "the shell must become thinner to satisfy this condition . in a more intuitive way one may think of the growth of the inner radius as if it grew into the shell so that we had to subtract a shell with thickness @xmath305 from the inner border of the @xmath7shell and to add the missing volume at the outer border of the whole configuration . as the radius of the shell to add there is bigger than at the inner border , we need not to add @xmath305 but a shell of a smaller thickness to keep @xmath306 constant .",
    "this means that the radius @xmath35 of the total configuration does not grow by @xmath305 but by @xmath307 . with increasing size of the expanding inner sphere and the corresponding reduction of the thickness of the @xmath7shell , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : einfaches - modell - besch ] on the right , the difference of the thickness of the shell taken away at the inner border of @xmath7 and added at the outer border decreases .",
    "@xmath308 becomes more and more @xmath305 , i.e. it increases .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 experiences accelerated expansion as the growth @xmath308 in a fixed interval @xmath304 is growing . from this explanation",
    "it becomes also clear that accelerated expansion can only be a temporary effect . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acc - without - acc ] ) this is reflected by the fact that with the growth of the @xmath8region the parameter @xmath0 is going to zero and with it @xmath309 .",
    "this explanation also shows that the effect depends on the number of dimensions in which one is evaluating it . in a one  dimensional setup",
    ", it will not appear at all as the two scale factors just add linearly .",
    "it then grows with every dimension one adds what may be seen in the growth of the second term in ( [ eq : acc - split ] ) .",
    "adding generic volumes of the same shape but evolving differently , one has geometric effects on the evolution of the global scale factor ( e.g. combine @xmath310 squares to a bigger square but , as soon as you evolve the individual squares differently , the overall shape will not be a square ) .",
    "if we generalize the setup a little to include a decelerated expansion of the @xmath8region , eq .",
    "( [ eq : acc - without - acc ] ) acquires an extra @xmath300 term .",
    "if it is smaller than the @xmath311 term , one has acceleration of the whole configuration despite deceleration of the inner constituent .",
    "note that the acceleration described above also shows up in a configuration where the inner part is contracting , i.e. @xmath312 .",
    "then , the difference between the shell that has to be taken away at the exterior of the outer @xmath7region and the one that has to be added on the inner side of the @xmath7shell will be growing . first , they are similar , but finally , a reduction of the diameter of the @xmath8region by @xmath305 will result in a smaller reduction of the overall diameter @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath307 .",
    "this is to be interpreted as acceleration of the @xmath15region in the sense of shrinking deceleration .    to go one step",
    "further one could imagine to have a toy model of the universe build up out of balls of the first type .",
    "each of them expands in an accelerated way .",
    "if the accelerated phase sets in during a narrow interval of time for all of the balls , one would find that the effect adds up and can cause global acceleration .",
    "the setup in this extended case is a bit similar to the swiss cheese models , but without the restriction of the embedding in an overall flrw evolution .",
    "the emergence of accelerated volume expansion despite local deceleration has been already widely discussed in the literature .",
    "essentially it is due to the fact that the local contributions are correlated in an average @xcite . to give a more intuitive explanation , rsnen , for example , argued in @xcite that the physical reason for this volume acceleration is that the volume fraction of the faster expanding regions rises . in our partitioning approach",
    "this is reflected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acc - split ] ) , which may be recast in the form @xmath313^{-1}\\dot{\\lambda}_{{{\\cal m}}}^{2}\\;.\\ ] ] it underlines the statement that there can be accelerated expansion if the change of the volume fraction of the faster expanding regions @xmath314 is sufficient .",
    "it also shows that the possibility of acceleration holds beyond the toy model case .",
    "if structure formation is rapid enough so that @xmath314 is able to counterbalance @xmath315 and @xmath316 , it will drive acceleration .    from the averaged equations themselves",
    "one can derive the condition for an acceleration of the volume scale factor .",
    "for strong backreaction ( see @xcite for the distinction between weak and strong backreaction ) equation ( [ eq : raychaudhuri - mittel ] ) tells us that @xmath26 must be positive and bigger than @xmath317 to lead to acceleration . in view of the definition ( [ eq : def - q ] ) this means that the term @xmath92 has to be sufficiently bigger than the shear term @xmath32 , i.e. the universe should be dominated by expansion fluctuations rather than by fluctuations of the averaged rate of shear .",
    "here we want to describe how the results on the evolution of the @xmath0 parameter in figs .",
    "[ fig : skalierung - von - q ] and [ fig : flrw - fit - lambda ] were obtained . the data that we analyzed were obtained from a simulation of the virgo supercomputing consortium @xcite .",
    "they trace the structure formation in a cube of a sidelength of @xmath318mpc .",
    "the underlying cosmological model was a @xmath5cdm model with @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "the simulation contained @xmath321 particles .      to obtain a rough approximation of the overdensity field",
    ", we separated the data cube with a mesh with a fixed grid size and determined the number of data points in the cells .",
    "then we added up the volume of the most dense cells until the sum of the points contained in the cells added reached half the number of total points of the simulation volume .",
    "this is because we decided to fix the characterization of the volumes in the initial , near to homogeneous state . under the assumption of a gaussian distribution of the density field with only small density fluctuations",
    ", approximately one half of the mass in the universe will be in overdense @xmath7 resp .",
    "underdense @xmath8regions , if their typical size was nearly the same at that epoch .",
    "the volume obtained by the addition described was suspected to be @xmath322 and used to determine @xmath0 by dividing by the total box volume . of course this identification is a source of error because it may happen that in a region that was underdense in the beginning structure formation leads to a density peak that belongs to the densest half of the matter distribution .",
    "but as the considerations in this paper are mostly concerned with the influence of structure formation on the global expansion history , we expect the error to be tolerable .",
    "apart from this problem the determination is well  defined even if the @xmath7regions scale differently than the global @xmath323scaling of the simulation .",
    "this is because we are only interested in volume fractions and assume our background region @xmath15 to scale as @xmath323 in section  [ sec : modelling - structure - formation ] , even if we assume different physical reasons for this behavior .",
    "then @xmath324 where @xmath325 and @xmath326 are the number of boxes of the overdense half and the total number of boxes respectively , and the simulation volume just drops out .        to derive a more reliable estimate for @xmath0 than the one obtained by the procedure described above",
    ", one would have to consider lagrangian domains as required by the averaging formalism .",
    "this would imply to have a clear definition of the volume associated to the particles in the initial state and to follow exactly this volume throughout the evolution . as in the real world , at least at small scales vorticity is not absent , it would be complicated to put this into practice , especially in a relativistic framework .",
    "other complications include particle crossing and domain merging .",
    "we suppose , however , that the outcome would not be completely different , since averaging strategies to find extensive quantities over smoothed  out singularities are implementable and would likely not change the partitioning .",
    "it is clear that there is a huge potential to improve on our rough evaluation .",
    "the above procedure was carried out for different grid sizes to get an impression of the dependence of @xmath0 on the grid length .",
    "the result is shown on the left ",
    "hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "we used values of @xmath42@xmath327 .",
    "the plot makes clear that there is in fact a strong dependence of @xmath0 on the grid size .",
    "this is not surprising as structure formation in the universe proceeds in a hierarchical way .",
    "the small  scale structure forms first and then starts to combine to larger structures .",
    "this is reflected in the steeper decrease of @xmath0 for smaller grid lengths .    to motivate the choices of grid resolution in sec .",
    "[ sec : a - simple - scaling ] we consider that a scale of @xmath328 , as used for the lowest curve of fig .",
    "[ fig : lamda - skala ] , may already be too small as the simulation is used for large  scale structure .",
    "the highest curves above @xmath329 grid length is on the other hand already merging typical overdense structures like clusters with underdense voids . if one takes into account that a typical cluster of galaxies is in the range of @xmath330 one would expect that grid sizes of @xmath331 are perhaps best adopted to the considered problem",
    "therefore , we chose a grid length of @xmath140 for the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : skalierung - von - q ] .    for the results of section  [ sub : quantitative - conclusions ] we had to find an adequate functional form for the evolution of @xmath204 . from the theoretical point of view it should meet several requirements .",
    "first of all , we expect @xmath0 to start at an initial value of about @xmath332 on all scales , as the density fluctuations of the early universe are assumed to be gaussian",
    ". the second condition should be that it does not deviate rapidly from this value at the beginning .",
    "so @xmath0 should have a flat tangent at @xmath183 .",
    "third , we expect that @xmath0 tends to @xmath117 on all scales as matter clusters strongly and the voids keep expanding . for a standard @xmath5cdm model",
    "this is even more true as then the cosmological constant will accelerate the growth of the empty regions between the matter filaments .",
    "these three conditions lead to the ansatz of ( [ eq : fit - komplex ] ) .",
    "as the fixed mesh is not adapted to the real matter distribution in the simulation volume , we used in a second step a partitioning of the volume into voronoi regions .",
    "this approach has been advocated by van de weygaert @xcite and assigns each simulated point the region that is closer to it than to any other point . in condensed matter physics",
    "a voronoi cell is better known as the wigner seitz cell . to calculate the voronoi cells we used the program `` qhull '' @xcite , and derived @xmath0 in the same way as described above by adding the densest voronoi cells .",
    "the resulting points are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lamda - skala ] on the left together with the curves for @xmath332 , @xmath42 and @xmath140 , as derived by the mesh method .",
    "the plot shows that the voronoi results are closest to the @xmath328mesh ones .",
    "the shape , however , shows a steeper behavior in the beginning , which one would interpret as a faster structure formation .",
    "the voronoi result was used for the fit of @xmath0 of fig .",
    "[ fig : flrw - fit - lambda ] .      to this end",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : struktur - statistik ] on the right the evolution of the distribution of the density contrasts of the voronoi cells . for our first data at a redshift of @xmath333",
    "the distribution still is strongly peaked around zero .",
    "the maximum is then moving to underdense regions . in the meantime",
    "a second maximum emerges for high density regions .",
    "the mean overdensity , however , stays zero all the time .",
    "it is interesting to see that the distribution spreads and reaches an extension of @xmath334 orders of magnitude in the density contrast .",
    "these extreme differences in the local densities and their expected different evolution is one of the main motivation for the idea of a structure formation effect on the global evolution ."
