    "the main goal of the current experimental program at the slac and kek @xmath16-meson factories is a stringent test of the standard model description of cp violation . in the future",
    "this aim will be pursued with measurements of still higher precision from hadron machines at fermilab and cern .",
    "a crucial benchmark is the time - dependent cp violation in @xmath4 decays , which allows us to infer the ckm phase @xmath17 with negligible hadronic uncertainties .",
    "likewise of central importance for obtaining additional information on ckm parameters is the time - dependent cp violation , both mixing - induced ( @xmath2 ) and direct ( @xmath10 ) , in @xmath0 .",
    "however , in this case the extraction of weak phases is complicated by a penguin component in the decay amplitude , which carries a weak phase different from the leading tree - level contribution .",
    "this leads to a dependence of the cp asymmetries in @xmath0 on hadronic physics and to corresponding theoretical uncertainties .",
    "a possible strategy to circumvent this problem is the isospin analysis by gronau and london @xcite , where also the branching ratios of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and their charge conjugates have to be measured .",
    "this method is theoretically very clean , but the difficulty to measure @xmath19 decays with sufficient accuracy and the existence of discrete ambiguities are likely to prevent a successful realization .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate how the information on weak phases contained in the cp asymmetries of @xmath0 itself can be extracted in an optimal way .",
    "to some extent theoretical input on the penguin - to - tree ratio will be needed and can be provided by the qcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the impact of uncertainties in the calculation is in fact very mild .",
    "moreover , even if the detailed predictions of qcd factorization are ignored , it is still possible to derive rigorous bounds on the ckm unitarity triangle , using only very conservative assumptions .    in order to derive these results we propose the following strategy .",
    "first , the time - dependent cp asymmetries in @xmath0 are expressed in terms of wolfenstein parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "at the same time purely hadronic quantities are systematically isolated from ckm parameters , introducing magnitude @xmath7 and phase @xmath8 of a suitably normalized penguin - to - tree - ratio @xcite .",
    "we then combine the observable @xmath20 with the accurately known value of @xmath21 from @xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to obtain the exact unitarity triangle , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in a simple analytical form , depending only on @xmath3 , @xmath2 and the hadronic quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the dependence on the latter turns out to be particularly transparent , which greatly facilitates any further analysis .",
    "we are then able to derive bounds on the unitarity triangle practically free of hadronic uncertainties , or to fix @xmath5 and @xmath6 with theoretical input for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "there is already an extensive literature on the subject of extracting information on weak mixing angles from cp violation in @xmath0 . in these papers",
    "important aspects of the problem have been discussed and suggestion were made to constrain theoretical uncertainties . here",
    "we present a new way of exploiting the information contained in the cp violation observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the crucial elements are a definition of hadronic quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 independent of ckm parameters , the direct formulation of weak phases in terms of the basic wolfenstein parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , the resulting analytical determination of the unitarity triangle and the exact , explicit and very simple dependence on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this in turn greatly facilitates the analysis of theoretical uncertainties and gives , in combination with results based on the heavy - quark limit , robust determinations of the unitarity triangle , or rigorous ckm bounds with minimal hadronic input .",
    "these ideas were first presented in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , this analysis has been further discussed by botella and silva @xcite and lavoura @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we collect important basic formulas describing cp violation in @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the theory of the penguin parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "based on previous work we address in particular the issue of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in addition we investigate the analysis of @xmath0 decay amplitudes in a simultaneous expansion in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath22 is the number of colours . an interesting pattern of systematic simplifications resulting from the double expansion is pointed out . after this discussion of the hadronic input ,",
    "we turn to our phenomenological analysis .",
    "4 explores the determination of the unitarity triangle from @xmath2 and @xmath3 within the standard model .",
    "simple analytical expressions are presented and theoretically clean bounds are derived .",
    "we also evaluate the standard model expectation for @xmath2 using results from qcd factorization .",
    "5 considers the determination of ckm angle @xmath23 from @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath24 .",
    "this alternative possibility is useful if new physics affects the phase of @xmath11@xmath12 mixing .",
    "6 examines what can be learned from @xmath10 , the parameter of direct cp violation in @xmath0 .",
    "methods to validate the predictions of qcd factorization for @xmath0 using additional observables are described in sec .",
    "we summarize our main results in sec .",
    "the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath0 decays is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 in terms of the wolfenstein parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite the ckm phase factors read @xmath27 the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 the real parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 defined in this way are pure strong interaction quantities without further dependence on ckm variables .    for any given values of @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "a measurement of @xmath2 defines a curve in the ( @xmath5 , @xmath6)-plane . using the relations above this constraint",
    "is given by the equation @xmath30}{((1-\\bar\\rho)^2+\\bar\\eta^2 )           ( \\bar\\rho^2+\\bar\\eta^2+r^2 + 2 r\\bar\\rho \\cos\\phi)}\\ ] ] similarly the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 reads @xmath31 this is equivalent to @xmath32 describing a circle in the ( @xmath5 , @xmath6)-plane with centre at ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and radius @xmath35 .",
    "the current experimental results for @xmath2 and @xmath10 are @xmath36 a recent preliminary update from babar gives @xcite @xmath37",
    "in this section we discuss theoretical calculations of the penguin contribution in @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis is based on the effective weak hamiltonian @xmath38 where @xmath39 are wilson coefficients , known at next - to - leading order @xcite , and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) are local four - quark operators with flavour structure @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 is the chromomagnetic operator @xmath45 .",
    "the ckm factors are here denoted by @xmath46 .",
    "the penguin parameter @xmath47 has been computed in @xcite in the framework of qcd factorization .",
    "the result can be expressed in the form @xmath48 } {   a_1+a^u_4 + r^\\pi_\\chi a^u_6 + r_a[b_1+b_3 + 2 b_4 ] } \\ ] ] where we neglected the very small effects from electroweak penguin operators .",
    "the factorization coefficients @xmath49 are linear combinations of the wilson coefficients @xmath39 in the effective weak hamiltonian and include the @xmath50 corrections from hard gluon interactions in the weak matrix elements .",
    "their expressions can be found in @xcite .",
    "the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 are defined by @xmath53 @xmath51 is defined in terms of the @xmath54 quark masses @xmath55 and depends on the renormalization scale @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is a @xmath58 transition form factor , evaluated at momentum transfer @xmath59 .",
    "both quantities in ( [ rchira ] ) are of subleading power @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is numerically very small .",
    "it sets the scale for the weak annihilation effects in the amplitude , which are parametrized by the @xmath62 in ( [ rqcd ] ) @xcite .",
    "they represent power corrections that are not calculable in qcd factorization .",
    "model - dependent estimates for these subleading effects have been given in @xcite in order to assess the corresponding uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath63 is numerically sizable . still the important penguin contributions @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , are calculable and can be included in the analysis . a third class of power corrections that need to be considered are uncalculable spectator interactions , some of which also come with the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "these enter the @xmath49 in ( [ rqcd ] ) and were also estimated in @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : rphi ] we show the values for @xmath7 and @xmath8    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the parameter @xmath67 differs from @xmath7 in the numerator through a different annihilation correction ( @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 ( [ rqcd ] ) ) and through small @xmath70 breaking differences in the light - meson distribution amplitudes ( @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 ) . in the denominator",
    "@xmath67 has the pure tree amplitude @xmath73 , while @xmath7 has @xmath74 corrected by small penguin and annihilation terms . despite these differences in details , the structure of @xmath7 and @xmath67 are very similar .",
    "in fact , the theoretical value for @xmath67 from qcd factorization @xmath75 is very close to the corresponding value for @xmath7 , and both are in agreement with the experimental number in ( [ rtilde ] ) .    a final comment concerns the branching ratio for @xmath19 , which appears to be somewhat larger experimentally ( table [ tab : data ] ) than expected in recent theoretical calculations @xcite , even though the error bar is still large .",
    "it should be stressed that @xmath19 , being colour - suppressed ( amplitude involving @xmath76 ) , is highly sensitive to the dynamics of hard spectator interactions , which so far are only known to lowest order in qcd and depend on poorly known input within the factorization framework .",
    "these uncertainties strongly affect @xmath19 , but are considerably smaller in @xmath77 and @xmath0 , as already pointed out in @xcite . in @xcite a scenario with an enhanced @xmath19 rate , without the need for very unusual hadronic input , was suggested .",
    "such a scenario with large @xmath76 could be checked using the factorization test discussed in the preceding subsection .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the uncertainties in @xmath76 specific to @xmath19 have essentially no impact on the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath78 , because the dominant hadronic physics is characteristically different .",
    "even a relatively large value of @xmath79 does therefore not invalidate the theoretical results for @xmath78 .",
    "amplitudes from weak annihilation represent power suppressed corrections , which are uncalculable in qcd factorization and so far need to be estimated relying on models @xcite . at present",
    "there are no indications that annihilation terms would be anomalously large , but they do contribute to the theoretical uncertainty . effectively , annihilation corrections may be considered as part of the penguin amplitudes . to some extent , therefore , they are tested with help of the quantity @xmath67 discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "nevertheless , in order to disentangle their impact from other effects it is of great interest to test annihilation separately .",
    "this can be done with decay modes that proceed through annihilation or at least have a dominant annihilation component .",
    "an example is the pure annihilation channel @xmath80 .",
    "even though this case is somewhat different from the reactions of primary interest here , because of the charmed meson in the final state , it is still useful to cross - check the typical size of annihilation expected in model calculations . treating the @xmath81 meson in the model estimate for annihilation @xcite",
    "as suggested in @xcite , one finds a central ( cp - averaged ) branching ratio of @xmath82 and an upper limit of @xmath83@xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with the current experimental result @xmath84 ( see refs . in @xcite ) .",
    "additional tests should come from annihilation decays into two light mesons , such as the @xmath85 modes in table [ tab : data ] . these , however , are ckm suppressed and only upper limits are known at present .",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath87 channels have both annihilation and penguin contributions . on the other hand",
    "@xmath88 is a pure weak annihilation process and therefore especially important .",
    "further discussions can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have proposed strategies to extract information on weak phases from cp violation observables in @xmath0 decays even in the presence of hadronic contributions related to penguin amplitudes .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "an efficient use of mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath0 decays , measured by @xmath2 , can be made by combining it with the corresponding observable from @xmath4 , @xmath3 or @xmath89 . *",
    "* the unitarity triangle parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 can then be obtained in closed form as functions of the observables @xmath90 , @xmath2 and the hadronic penguin parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ rhotaueta ] ) , ( [ etataus ] ) ) . * * the sensitivity on the hadronic quantities , which have typical values @xmath91 , @xmath92 , is very weak . in particular , there are no first - order corrections in @xmath8 . for moderate values of @xmath8",
    "its effect is negligible . * * neglecting @xmath8 , the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 comes merely through an overall factor @xmath93 .",
    "the impact of the uncertainty in @xmath91 becomes clearly visible and is seen to be greatly reduced .",
    "a simple determination of the unitarity triangle from @xmath90 and @xmath2 is thus possible ( see eq .",
    "( [ etataus0 ] ) ) . *",
    "the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath9 , @xmath94 and @xmath23 are bounded from below , depending only on @xmath90 and @xmath2 and essentially without relying on hadronic input ( see eq .",
    "( [ etabound ] ) ) . * the parameter of direct cp violation @xmath10 depends much stronger on hadronic input than @xmath2 , but yields complementary information and can constrain @xmath7 and @xmath8 within the standard model . *",
    "an alternative analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath10 especially suitable for the presence of a new - physics phase in @xmath11@xmath12 mixing was discussed .    as an input to the phenomenological discussion we also studied the calculation of the penguin parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 in qcd :    * we have analyzed @xmath7 and @xmath8 within qcd factorization with a particular view on theoretical uncertainties .",
    "* @xmath0 amplitudes can be expanded simultaneously in @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which leads to an interesting pattern of simplifications .",
    "all power corrections suffering from infrared endpoint divergences in the factorization formalism are at least of second order in this double expansion , while the most important effects survive at linear oder in @xmath13 or @xmath14 . *",
    "the different contributions to @xmath0 amplitudes , the tree - component , the penguin - to - tree ratio and annihilation effects , appear in similar form in other @xmath16 decay channels , such as @xmath18 , @xmath95 and @xmath88 .",
    "these can be used to validate theoretical predictions , separately for the various components .",
    "the results presented in this paper should be useful for interpreting the forthcoming experimental measurements of cp violation in @xmath0 decays in a transparent way and help to achieve a reliable control over theoretical uncertainties .",
