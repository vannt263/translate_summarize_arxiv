    "development of the grid technologies is the goal of many emerging projects in distributed , data - intensive computing .",
    "the idea of merging the capacity of computers worldwide is particularly appealing for tasks , which demand extensive processing of big amounts of data , located at geographically distributed databases .",
    "the grid provides innovative solutions , by introducing specific toolkits , which merge the computers involved into uniform networks .",
    "nordugrid  @xcite is the project with the aim to create the grid computing infrastructure in nordic countries , making use of the available middleware .",
    "project participants include universities and research centers in denmark , sweden , finland and norway .",
    "a secure , reliable , efficient and high performance data transfer mechanism over high - bandwidth wide area networks is a key component of any kind of grid infrastructure .",
    "the globus metacomputing project  @xcite has proposed the gridftp protocol  @xcite which contains extensions to the standard highly popular ftp protocol , in order to meet the requirements of high performance wide area data movement .",
    "their extended file transfer protocol supports the following features :    * grid security infrastructure ( gsi )  @xcite * partial file transfer * reliable data transfer * third - party ( from server to server ) transfer * automatic negotiation of tcp buffer sizes * parallel ( multi - threaded ) data transfer * data channel encryption    the globus team has provided software implementation of their protocol in terms of production libraries and tools . the gridftp code used was the alpha-4 release , checked out from the globus cvs  @xcite .",
    "all the new features except for the tcp buffer negotiation , has been implemented , and the code became a part of the globus toolkit  2 release  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this investigation was to examine the alpha release of the gridftp code , test and compare its performance to standard ftp file transfer within the framework of the nordugrid project .",
    "because the gridftp will be the underlying data transfer engine of many grid projects , it is very important to have a first - hand experience of its performance and capabilities over the nordugrid hardware and network resources .",
    "particularly interesting issue is the expected performance improvements due to the new parallel transfer mechanism of the gridftp protocol .",
    "it is well - known that the utilisation of parallel streams in data transfer over high speed wan connections is a feasible solution to overcome the tcp buffer size limitations without the necessity of the modifications of any sensitive tcp system parameters  @xcite , therefore parallel streams can lead to a significant improvement in data throughput .",
    "although several multi - threaded file transfer clients exist based on the single - threaded ftp protocol , the globus project s gridftp implementation is one of a very few , which support parallel streams on the protocol level . in the tests presented here , the parallel gridftp performance over the nordugrid network have been measured .    ]",
    "four nordugrid sites , copenhagen , lund , oslo and uppsala , have been participating in the tests . the sites are connected via the high speed nordunet network  @xcite , the actual network configuration is given in figure  [ fig : connectivity ] .",
    "at each site a dedicated linux server ( the globus gatekeeper of the local grid cluster ) with a gridftp server installed was used in the investigation .",
    "the servers of lund and uppsala are connected through a 100  mbit / s link to the lan , the copenhagen server has a gigabit connection , while the oslo server at the time of the investigation had only a 10  mbit / s lan connection .",

    "a test file of a size of 100  mbytes was transferred among the sites , since it was found that this was large enough to average out most of the network fluctuations . a single test consisted of repeated number of measurements of the transfer time of the same file over the same link within a short time interva;. during the tests ,",
    "the default tcp settings were not modified , since the purpose was to study the performance without tuning system parameters .",
    "throughput measurements with respect to different number of parallel threads were performed over three different network connections :    * lund - copenhagen ( 15 router hops ) * lund - uppsala ( 9 router hops ) * lund - oslo ( 11 router hops )    an example of the command issued to transfer a file in 6 parallel threads from a local node to uppsala is : + ` globus - url - copy -p 6 \\ ` + ` file:/tmp/100mb.tmp ` gsiftp:`//grid.tsl.uu.se / tmp/100mb.tmp ` + during the investigation , it was found that the background load of the network link had a significant influence on the download performance : for example , a single - threaded download time of the test file from uppsala to lund could change from 64s in the morning to 284s in the afternoon . however , for a reasonable period of time ( approximately half an hour ) the network conditions could be considered being stable . during the measurements",
    ", it was found that most of the cases over any given link the downloading time did not vary more than 5% , provided the downloads were made within 30 minutes .",
    "therefore , in order to eliminate the effect of changing network load , download times were compared only if the downloads were performed over the same network link and taken within the same short time interval ; furthermore , all the unreconsctructable and outstanding values were discarded .",
    "for a specific collection of data it was required that the difference in the download time of the test file measured at the beginning and at the end of the test session did not exceed 5% : in this way one could assume that the test downloads were carried out over a relatively constant network load of the particular network link .",
    "before investigating the parallel performance of the gridftp protocol and the _ globus - url - copy _ client , tests comparing different linux and ms windows based ftp clients were carried out .",
    "downloads were performed from the uppsala server using different ftp clients installed on a dual booting ( mandrake 8.0 linux and w2k ) p - iii 1  ghz machine in lund . under linux ,",
    "the ftp , ncftp , lftp , ssh copy and the prozilla  @xcite clients were tested .",
    "the prozilla application is a multi - threaded linux ftp client .",
    "it is capable of opening multiple connections to a server , where each of the connections downloads a part of a file , and upon completion of downloads , the partial files are merged .    ]    after rebooting the machine to w2k , the tests were repeated with ftp , windows commander built - in client , and cuteftp pro .",
    "the latter client allows up to 4 parallel connections per transferred file .    ]    the download performance of the clients were compared to single and multiple threaded gridftp downloads .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : clients ] and figure  [ fig : multiclients ] .",
    "it can be seen that multi - threaded clients generally improve the transfer time , while linux clients routinely outperform those of w2k .",
    "the linux multi - threaded downloader prozilla , although providing higher transfer rates with increasing thread number , generally consumes too much time during the reconstruction phase , slowing down the performance .",
    "gridftp provides the fastest downloads already with 4 threads , and can improve further , providing lan performance and the network load allow for it .",
    "the main gridftp tests were carried out between lund and uppsala . at both sites ,",
    "the gridftp servers are connected to their lan with a fast 100  mbit / s ethernet link .",
    "lund has a 155  mbit / s connection to the malm backbone , which is connected via a 622  mbit / s line to stockholm , and stockholm in turn has a 155  mbit / s line to uppsala ( see figure  [ fig : connectivity ] ) .",
    "the network load of the data paths on the day of the measurements is shown in figures  [ fig : malmolund ] to [ fig : stkupps ]  @xcite .",
    "most of the day ( 9:00 thru 1:00 cet ) , the lund - malm link is usually overloaded ( running at 90 - 100% of its total capacity ) , while the other two links have a moderate load of  40% .    ]    ]    ]    two sets of tests were performed : the first series of transfer measurements were taken in the morning at a relatively low network load , while the second was performed over a congested network at peak time .",
    "the throughput performance of the gridftp with respect to the number of parallel threads via transferring the 100  mbyte test file between lund and uppsala was measured ( see figure  [ fig : uu2lu ] ) .    ]",
    "usage of parallel threads radically increased the transfer rate both over the congested and uncongested network , regardless of the load .",
    "the performance was steadily increasing for up to @xmath164 threads ; over 96 threads instabilities and lower transfer rates were experienced . over a congested network , the throughput with 64 threads increased 780% and 980% respectively in the two directions , compared to the normal single - threaded transfer . in case of the unloaded network , the transfer rate increased from 20  mbit / s to 60  mbit / s ( lund to uppsala ) , which is actually around the maximum throughput of a 100  mbit / s lan .",
    "this means that over the lund - uppsala data path already the lan performance represents the bottleneck in the multi - threaded gridftp downloads .      ]",
    "lund is connected to oslo through the 155  mbit / s lund - malmo , 2.5  gbit / s malmo - stockholm and 2.5  gbit / s stockholm - oslo links .",
    "however , the 10  mbit / s lan connection of the oslo server was the real bottleneck on the lund - oslo data path .",
    "the result of the multi - threaded test downloads from oslo to lund is shown in figure  [ fig : uio2lu ] .",
    "the 7  mbit / s single - threaded transfer rate is already close to the 10  mbit / s theoretical maximum , thus the 10  mbit / s networking bottleneck seriously limits the functionality of the parallel downloads .      ]    the lund - copenhagen datalink , despite the geographical neighbourhood of the two sites , represents the longest network connection in these gridftp tests ( 15 router hops ) .",
    "the data travel from lund to stockholm , then from stockholm through a 2.5  gbit / s link to lyngby , the danish nordunet gateway , and finally arrives to copenhagen ( see figure  [ fig : lu2nbi ] ) . performing parallel downloads from lund to copenhagen , a throughput gain from 7  mbit / s to 30  mbit / s ( over a congested network )",
    "was experienced , obtained with 32 threads compared to the single download rate .      ]    finally , third party transfer tests from copenhagen ( controller ) between the servers of lund and uppsala were made ( see figure  [ fig : uu3lu ] ) .",
    "a third party transfer implies two ftp control channels to servers from the controller , and one data channel between the two servers .",
    "the parallel threads resulted in a performance gain similar to one of the case of the direct transfer ( compare figure  [ fig : uu2lu ] and figure  [ fig : uu3lu ] ) .",
    "the transfer rate increased from the single - threaded 15 - 20 m  bit / s up to 50 - 55  mbit / s , achieved with 32 threads .      in spite of the alpha status of the gridftp software implementation , it was found that the _ globus - url - copy _ client and the _ gsi - wuftpd _ server are rather stable .",
    "however , using more than hundred parallel streams can sometimes cause instabilities . on several occasions , with large number of used threads , the start - up phase of the download froze for several seconds . restarting the transfer usually solved the problem .",
    "more common unstable behaviour of the above-100-threads downloads was the extremely slow completion of the last few hundred kilobytes . on few occasions , the download process in its finishing state ( retrieving the last few hundred bytes ) suddenly restarted from the beginning .",
    "a general conclusion is that the software implementation for above ca .",
    "100 threads became unreliable .",
    "we expect that these instabilities will be resolved with the final globus toolkit  2 release .",
    "in this report the high performance gridftp data transfer mechanism was evaluated over the nordugrid resources .",
    "the tests were mainly focused on the performance gain due to the usage of parallel streams .",
    "another purpose was to compare the performance of the globus gridftp implementation to several ordinary ftp clients .",
    "it was found that the performance of the conventional ftp clients differ not more than 20 percent and that the single threaded gridftp could deliver performance in the same range .",
    "the multi - threaded gridftp transfers resulted in a remarkable performance increase of about 600 - 800 percent , compared to a single threaded gridftp ( or conventional ftp ) downloads .",
    "parallel threads lead to increased throughput over both congested and unloaded networks .",
    "it s worth to point out that in some of the cases the lan or the actual hardware configuration became the bottleneck in the gridftp tests .",
    "parallel third party ( server to server ) transfers were tested and similar performance enhancement to direct transfers was achieved .",
    "it is clearly unfair towards other users to execute a multi - threaded transfer over a congested network , as it consumes bandwith proportional to the number of threads . however ,",
    "if a big bandwith is available , like in the case of a fat long dedicated line , a multi - threaded transfer is the only way to use all the available capacity without changing the system parameters .",
    "the tests were by no means exhaustive , many other cases could have been considered .",
    "the nordugrid network resources are going to be considerably upgraded ( the lund - malm and the copenhagen - lyngby links ) and the tests are planned to be extended using the upgraded network ; moreover a dedicated 1gbit / s cern - copenhagen link is about to be set up for tests purposes in the near future .",
    "the alpha status software is proved to be relatively stable , since irregularities occurred only for downloads involving exaggerated amount of threads ( above 100 ) .",
    "after these tests were done , the globus toolkit  2 was released , which includes an upgraded version of gridftp .",
    "the conclusion is that the multi - threaded gridftp significantly boosted the data throughput over the nordugrid network and it is certainly a very promising solution for high performance data transfer .",
    "the nordugrid project is supported by the nordunet2 programme , financed by the nordic council of ministers and by the nordic governments ."
