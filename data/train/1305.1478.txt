    "input multiple  output ( mimo ) systems offer a significant increase in spectral efficiency in comparison to single antenna systems  @xcite .",
    "an example is spatial multiplexing ( smx )  @xcite , which transmits simultaneously over all the transmit antennas .",
    "this method achieves a spectral efficiency that increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas .",
    "however , these systems can not cope with the exponential increase of wireless data traffic , and a larger number of transmit antennas ( large scale mimo ) should be used  @xcite .",
    "large scale mimo studied in  @xcite , offers higher data rates and better bit error rate ( ber ) performance .",
    "however , this comes at the expense of an increase in :    1 .",
    "computational complexity : a smx maximum likelihood ( ml ) optimum receiver searches across all possible combinations , and tries to resolve the inter  channel interference ( ici ) caused by transmitting from all antennas simultaneously , on the same frequency . sphere decoder ( sd ) was proposed to reduce the complexity of the smx ",
    "ml algorithm while retaining a near optimum performance  @xcite .",
    "the sd reduces the complexity of the ml decoder by limiting the number of possible combinations .",
    "only those combinations that lie within a sphere centred at the received signal are considered . however , even though smx  sd offers a large reduction in complexity compared to smx ",
    "ml , it still has a high complexity which increases with the increase of the number of transmit antennas .",
    "hardware complexity : in smx the number of radio frequency ( rf ) chains is equal to the number of transmit antennas . from  @xcite ,",
    "rf chains are circuits that do not follow moore s law in progressive improvement . therefore ,",
    "increasing the number of transmit antennas and consequently the number of rf chains increases significantly the cost of real system implementation  @xcite .",
    "energy consumption : rf chains contain power amplifiers ( pas ) which are responsible for @xmath2@xmath3 of the total power consumption in the transmitter  @xcite .",
    "therefore , increasing the number of rf chains results in a decrease in the energy efficiency  @xcite .",
    "thus , smx may not always be feasible and a more energy efficient and low complexity solution should be considered .",
    "spatial modulation ( sm ) is a transmission technology proposed for mimo wireless systems .",
    "it aims to increase the spectral efficiency , @xmath4 , of single ",
    "antenna systems while avoiding ici  @xcite .",
    "this is attained through the adoption of a new modulation and coding scheme , which foresees : i )  the activation , at each time instance , of a single antenna that transmits a given data symbol ( _ constellation symbol _ ) , and ii )  the exploitation of the spatial position ( index ) of the active antenna as an additional dimension for data transmission ( _ spatial symbol _ )",
    "both the _ constellation symbol _ and the _ spatial symbol _ depend on the incoming data bits .",
    "an overall increase by the base  two logarithm of the number of transmit",
    " antennas of the spectral efficiency is achieved .",
    "this limits the number of transmit antennas to be a power of two unless fractional bit encoding sm ( fbe  sm )  @xcite , or generalised sm ( gsm )  @xcite are used . activating only one antenna at a time",
    "means that only one rf chain is needed , which significantly reduces the hardware complexity of the system  @xcite . moreover , as only one rf chain is needed , sm offers a reduction in the energy consumption which scales linearly with the number of transmit antennas  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the computational complexity of sm ",
    "ml is equal to the complexity of single  input multiple ",
    "output ( simo ) systems  @xcite , _ i.e. _ the complexity of sm  ml depends only on the spectral efficiency and the number of receive antennas , and does not depend on the number of transmit antennas .",
    "recently the potential benefits of sm have been validated not only by simulations but also via experiments  @xcite . moreover , in  @xcite for the first time the performance of sm is analysed using real  world channel measurements .",
    "accordingly , sm appears to be a good candidate for large scale mimo  @xcite .    in spite of its low  complexity implementation",
    ", there is still potential for further reductions , by limiting the number of possible combinations using the sd principle .",
    "however , existing sd algorithms in literature do not consider the basic and fundamental principle of sm , that only one antenna is active at any given time instance .",
    "therefore , two modified sd algorithms based on the tree search structure that are tailored to sm are proposed .",
    "the first sd will be called receiver",
    " centric sd ( sm  rx ) , which was first presented in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm in  @xcite combines the received signal from the multiple receive antennas , as long as the euclidean distance from the received point is less than a given radius .",
    "this sd  based detector is especially suitable when the number of receive ",
    "antennas is very large .",
    "this technique reduces the size of the search space related to the multiple antennas at the receiver ( we denote this search space as `` receive search space '' ) .",
    "it will be shown later that there is no loss in either the diversity order or the coding gain , _",
    "i.e. _ the ber is very close to that of the ml detector .",
    "however , the main limitation is that it does not reduce the search space related to the number of possible transmitted points ( we denote this as `` transmit search space '' ) .",
    "this limitation prevents the detector from achieving a significant reduction in computational complexity when high data rates are required .",
    "the second sd , which is called transmit ",
    "( sm  tx ) was first presented in  @xcite .",
    "it aims at reducing the transmit search space by limiting the number of possible spatial and constellation points . the sm ",
    "tx algorithm avoids an exhaustive search by examining only those points that lie inside a sphere with a given radius .",
    "however , sm  tx is limited to the overdetermined mimo setup @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number of transit and receiver antennas respectively . in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that sm ",
    "tx in  @xcite can still be used for the case of @xmath8 , where sm ",
    "tx is referred to as enhanced tx ",
    "sd ( e  tx  sd ) .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite a detector for the case of @xmath9 referred to as generalised tx ",
    "sd ( g  tx  sd ) is proposed . by using the division algorithm the g ",
    "tx  sd technique : 1 ) divides the set of possible antennas to a number of subsets . 2 ) performs e  tx  sd over each subset .",
    "3 ) takes the minimum solution of all the sets .",
    "however , in this paper we propose a simple solution , in which all that is needed is to set a constant @xmath10 to @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath9 , where @xmath14 is the noise variance . in  @xcite , the normalised expected number of nodes visited by the sm  tx algorithm is used to compare its complexity with the complexity of the sm ",
    "ml algorithm .",
    "this does not take into account pre  computations needed by sm ",
    "tx . in this paper , when comparing the complexity of sm  tx with the complexity of sm  ml and sm ",
    "rx , we take into account the pre  computations needed by the sm  tx .",
    "we show that because of those pre  computations , the sm ",
    "tx technique is not always the best solution , where in some cases it is even more complex than sm  ml .",
    "the performance of both sds is closely tied to the choice of the initial radius .",
    "the chosen radius should be large enough for the sphere to contain the solution .",
    "on the one hand , the larger the radius is , the larger the search space , which increases the complexity . on the other hand",
    ", a small radius may cause the algorithm to fail in finding a point inside the sphere .    in this paper , a careful study of the performance of these two detectors",
    "is provided , along with an accurate comparison of their computational complexity .",
    "numerical results show that with no loss in the ber performance , the proposed solutions provide a substantial reduction in computational complexity with respect to the sm  ml decoder .",
    "we also derive a closed form expression for the ber performance of sm  sd and show that the initial radius can be chosen such that sm  sd gives an optimum performance .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that sm ",
    "rx is less complex than sm ",
    "tx for lower spectral efficiencies , while sm ",
    "tx is the best solution for higher spectral efficiencies .",
    "finally , using numerical results we show that sm ",
    "sd offers a significant reduction and nearly the same performance when compared to smx with ml decoder or sd .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : sysmodel ] , the system model along with the ml ",
    "optimum detector is summarised . in section [ sec : sd ] , the new sm ",
    "rx and sm  tx receivers are described . in section [ sec : comp ] , an accurate analysis of the computational complexity of both sm  rx and sm  tx is performed . in section [ sec : ana ] , the analytical ber performance for sm ",
    "sds is derived along with the initial radius selection method .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ sec : result ] , and the paper is concluded in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "in sm , the bit stream emitted by a binary source is divided into blocks containing @xmath15 bits each , where @xmath16 is the constellation size .",
    "then the following mapping rule is used  @xcite :    * the first @xmath17 bits are used to select the antenna which is switched on for data transmission , while the other transmit antennas are kept silent . in this paper , the actual transmit antenna which is active for transmission",
    "is denoted by @xmath18 with @xmath19 . *",
    "the second @xmath20 bits are used to choose a symbol in the signal  constellation diagram . without loss of generality , quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam )",
    "is considered . in this paper , the actual complex symbol emitted by the transmit antenna @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath23 transmitted vector is : @xmath24^t , \\label{eq : mod_vec}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25^t$ ] denotes transpose operation , and @xmath26 is a @xmath27 matrix with all  zero entries .",
    "note , a power constraint on the average energy per transmission of unity is assumed ( _ i.e. _ @xmath28=1 $ ] ) , where @xmath29 is the expectation operator .    from above ,",
    "the maximum achievable spectral efficiency by sm is ,    @xmath30    however , for smx ,    @xmath31    from and , we can see that the spectral efficiency of sm does not increase linearly with the number of transmit antennas as smx does .",
    "therefore , sm needs a larger number of transmit antennas/ larger constellation size to arrive at the same spectral efficiency as smx .",
    "however , because in sm only one antenna is active :    * the computational complexity of sm does not depend on the number of transmit antennas .",
    "unlike smx where the computational complexity increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas , the computational complexity of sm is the same as the computational complexity of simo systems . *",
    "the number of rf chains needed by sm is significantly less than the number of rf chains needed by smx .",
    "in fact , only one rf chain is required for sm .    for these reasons",
    "we believe that sm is a strong candidate for large scale mimo systems , which strongly motivates this work .",
    "the modulated vector , @xmath32 , in is transmitted through a frequency ",
    "flat @xmath33 mimo fading channel with transfer function @xmath34 , where @xmath7 is the number of receive antennas . in this paper ,",
    "a rayleigh fading channel model is assumed .",
    "thus , the entries of @xmath34 are modelled as complex independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "entries according to @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , a perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver is assumed , with no csi at the transmitter .",
    "thus , the @xmath36 received vector can be written as follows :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the @xmath7dimensional additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with zero  mean and variance @xmath39 per dimension at the receiver input , and @xmath40 is the @xmath41th column of @xmath34 .",
    "note , the signal - to - noise - ratio is @xmath42 .      the ml optimum receiver for mimo systems can be written as ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is a @xmath45 space containing all possible @xmath46 transmitted vectors , @xmath47 is the frobenius norm , and @xmath48 denotes the estimated spatial and constellation symbols .",
    "note , in sm only one transmit antenna is active at a time .",
    "therefore , the optimal receiver in can be simplified to , @xmath49 & = & \\mathop { \\arg \\min } \\limits_{\\scriptstyle \\ell \\in \\left\\ { { 1,2 , \\ldots n_t } \\right\\ } \\hfill \\atop    \\scriptstyle s \\in \\left\\ { { s_1 , s_2 , \\ldots s_m } \\right\\ } \\hfill } \\left\\ { { \\left\\| { { \\bf{y } } - { \\bf{h}}_\\ell s } \\right\\|_{\\rm{f}}^2 } \\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\    & = & \\mathop { \\arg \\min } \\limits_{\\scriptstyle \\ell \\in \\left\\ { { 1,2 , \\ldots n_t } \\right\\ } \\hfill \\atop    \\scriptstyle s \\in \\left\\ { { s_1 , s_2 , \\ldots s_m } \\right\\ } \\hfill } \\left\\ { { \\sum\\limits_{r = 1}^{n_r } { \\left| { y_r   - h_{\\ell , r } s } \\right|^2 } } \\right\\ } \\nonumber   \\\\ \\label{eq : ml}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the @xmath52th entries of @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
