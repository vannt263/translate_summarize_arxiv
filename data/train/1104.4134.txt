    "the photon echo techniques used for quantum information applications differ from those used in the classical domain .",
    "classical information processing using rare earth ion dopants relies on strong optical pulses to cause rephasing of the atomic coherences . applying a similar approach in the quantum realm would be highly desirable , but analysis has shown that the basic techniques , namely the two - pulse @xcite and three - pulse @xcite photon echo sequences , will not work as quantum memories .",

    "the two approaches currently used for photon echo quantum memories techniques , controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib)@xcite and atomic frequency combs ( afc)@xcite both require spectral holeburning .",

    ", spectral holeburning is used to create a spectrally narrow absorption feature .",
    "this is then broadened with a field gradient to accept the input light .",
    "the inverse spectral - width of the initial feature determines the storage time , and how far it is broadened determines the bandwidth . the light is then recalled by reversing the field gradient . to do this with high efficiency ,",
    "significant optical thickness is required for the broadened feature , which means that extremely large optical thicknesses are required for the unbroadened feature .",
    "hedges et al.@xcite started with an absorption of -130  db in the initial feature to achieve 69% efficiency with a time - bandwidth product only large enough to faithfully store one pulse .    in afc protocols",

    "@xcite and reasonable efficiencies have also been demonstrated @xcite .    with both crib and afc methods ,",
    "high efficiencies require efficient optical pumping and this requires long - lived shelving states .",
    "to date this has meant using shelving states in the dopant ions hyperfine structure .",
    "our proposal does not rely on spectral holeburning , and the removal of this restriction is very appealing .",
    "the hyperfine splittings are generally less than 100  mhz , which makes large bandwidth operation for the afc and crib protocols problematic .",

    "the downside of this approach is that high finesse frequency combs are not possible , severely limiting the efficiency .",
    "another reason to avoid spectral holeburning is the requirement of efficient holeburning limits the choice of material systems .",
    "for example , while single photon memories have been demonstrated at telecommunication wavelengths using erbium @xcite , the lack of an efficient holeburning mechanism severely limited the memory efficiency .",
    "ensemble quantum memories rely on the fact that the collective interaction with an optical field is greatly enhanced for systems with reasonable optical depths .",
    "the problem with optically rephased memories is that the strong optical rephasing pulses necessarily invert the population , this causes gain and the associated noise .",
    "here we propose avoiding this problem by using a perturbing field to spectrally broaden the ensemble while in the excited state to the point where it is optically thin .",
    "this removes the collective enhancement and stops the unwanted noise processes .",
    "we call this method where both reversible inhomogeneous broadening and optical rephasing methods are used hybrid photon echo rephasing ( hyper )",
    ".    another approach that avoids the use of spectral holeburning by using raman echoes has also been proposed @xcite .",

    "the troublesome collective interaction between the light and the atoms is effectively turned off while the atoms are in the excited state .",
    "while the dephasing caused by the applied broadening stops the two pulse echo forming , so long as the broadening applied before and after the first @xmath2-pulse are balanced an echo of the 2pe will form after a second @xmath2-pulse .",
