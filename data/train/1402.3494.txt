    "the investigation of the wettability of solid materials has a history of at least two centuries ; this interest has been caused by its fundamentals and its practical implications . during the last decade",
    ", the interest in hydrophobic surfaces has increased rapidly because of their applications to nanotechnology @xcite . in particular , such surfaces can dramatically change the transport properties of the flow , and this is especially important in the micro- and nanoscales .",
    "the presence of a special surface microtexture can drastically increase its hydrophobic properties .",
    "such a texture may be either natural or artificial .",
    "one of the remaining challenges in this field is related to the possibility of greatly enhancing transport properties by combining hydrophobicity with electrokinetic phenomena . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the classical helmholtz ",
    "smoluchowski electro - osmotic velocity acquires an additional factor of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the slip length and @xmath2 is the debye length .",
    "much more interesting is the case of an extended polarization near a charge - selective surface ( membrane , electrode or system of micro- and nanochannels ) . such a polarization can drive a hydrodynamic flow if a tangential component of the electric field exists along with its normal component",
    ". two key mechanisms can be responsible for the formation of such a tangential field : a curvature of the surface ( the so - called dukhin mechanism ) , or an electrokinetic instability ( the mechanism of rubinstein  zaltzman ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of a coupling near a charge - selective surface between electrokinetic phenomena and the hydrophobicity of such a surface is expected to be especially strong .",
    "such surfaces are known to be enormously sensitive to any microscopic geometric alterations @xcite , and is reasonable to expect a strong sensitivity with respect to their hydrophobicity . indeed , in the recent experiments by nikonenko et al .",
    "@xcite , several cation - exchange membranes with different degrees of hydrophobicity were investigated for the parameters corresponding to electrokinetic instability .",
    "it was found that an increase in the surface hydrophobicity is accompanied with a significant rise in the overlimiting mass transfer and a decrease in the threshold of the instability .",
    "a theoretical investigation of this practically important fundamental problem has been lacking .    _",
    "two kinds of slip .",
    "_ it is known that on a hydrophobic surface that , instead of what is usual for newtonian liquids ( where all velocity components vanish , both tangential and normal , i.e. , @xmath3 only the normal component vanishes while the tangential velocity components have a slip along the surface , i.e. , @xmath4 which is characterized by the slip length @xmath1 .",
    "the experimental information about the value of @xmath1 is rather contradictory and it can be roughly evaluated as @xmath5  nm , depending on the wall material . for natural superhydrophobicity , the slip length is much larger and can be up to several microns . in both cases ,",
    "the hydrophobicity and the natural superhydrophobicity @xmath1 is a scalar .",
    "an artificially fabricated micro- or nanotexture is usually oriented in some direction and , as a consequence , for such anisotropic surfaces , @xmath1 is a @xmath6 matrix @xcite . however , by a suitable averaging , an anisotropic surface can be considered as an isotropic one with some effective scalar slip @xmath7 .    a non - uniform tangential electric field forms an ion flux that is non - uniform along the membrane surface .",
    "this , in turn , gives rise to another kind of slip . at a distance of the space - charge region length , @xmath8  nm",
    ", the tangential velocity rapidly changes from zero to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the potential drop in the space charge region , @xmath11 is the normal to the surface ion flux , and @xmath12 is the surface hamilton operator @xcite . in order to distinguish two slip velocities , we shall call the latter one the ` electro - osmotic slip velocity ' and the first one , ` hydrophobic slip ' or just ` slip velosity ' .",
    "the electro - osmotic slip is a driving force to destabilize the flow in a diffusion region if it prevails over the viscous dissipation . on the other hand , the hydrophobicity and corrensponding hydrophobic slip results in a diminishing of this dissipation .    _",
    "_ in this paper , we present an analytical and numerical investigation of the coupling between these two kinds of slip .",
    "the formulation of the problem is given in section ii and is based on a binary dilute electrolyte model and creeping flow assumption .",
    "section iii is focused on an investigation of linear stability in the limit of a small debye number .",
    "a  simple formula is derived to evaluate the decrease in the instability threshold due to hydrophobicity .",
    "this investigation is complemented in section iv by numerical investigations both of the linear and nonlinear instabilities near a hydrophobic membrane surface .",
    "theory predicts a significant enhancement of the ion flux to the surface and shows a good qualitative agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "a binary electrolyte between semi - selective ion - exchange membrane surfaces , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , is considered .",
    "the lower membrane surface is assumed to be hydrophobic with a slip boundary condition while the upper membrane obeys a regular no - slip condition .",
    "tilded notations are used for the dimensional variables , as opposed to their untilded dimensionless counterparts .",
    "the diffusivities of the cations and anions are assumed to be equal , @xmath15 .",
    "the characteristic quantities to make the system dimensionless are @xmath16 , the characteristic length , the distance between the membranes ; @xmath17 , the characteristic time ; @xmath18 , the dynamic viscosity , which is taken as a characteristic dynamical value ; @xmath19 , the potential , which is taken as characteristic ; @xmath20 , the unperturbed bulk ion concentration of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) solution .",
