    "the developments in neutrino telescopes @xcite have stimulated ideas of using astrophysical neutrinos as the beam source for probing neutrino flavor transitions @xcite . recently",
    ", we have proposed a model independent parametrization for flavor transition mechanisms of astrophysical neutrinos , which propagate a vast distance from the source to the earth @xcite .",
    "such a parametrization , referred to as the @xmath2 matrix parametrization , is physical motivated , and it is a very convenient basis for classifying flavor transition models . we have argued that only @xmath3 and @xmath4 are nonvanishing by assuming the conservation of total neutrino flux and the validity of @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "these two nonvanishing matrix elements can be probed by measuring the flavor ratio of astrophysical neutrinos reaching to the earth .",
    "detailed discussions on flavor - ratio measurements in icecube were first presented in ref .",
    "as neutrinos interact with matters to produce observable signals , the major channel is the changed - current ( cc ) interaction .",
    "the electron produced through @xmath5 cc interaction has a large interaction cross section with the medium and produces a shower within a short distance from its production point .",
    "contrary to the electron , the muon produced through @xmath6 cc interaction can travel a long distance in the medium before it loses all its energy or decays .",
    "however , a muon does emit dim light along its propagation so that only those detectors near to the muon track can be triggered . as for @xmath7 detection ,",
    "the @xmath7-induced tau leptons behave differently at different energies for a fixed detector design . for a neutrino telescope such as icecube@xcite ,",
    "the observable energy range for the double bang event is @xmath8 . at lower energies , the observation for @xmath7 event would appear as a shower event since",
    "the two bangs can not be resolved . for an undersea experiment , such as km3net  @xcite",
    ", the observable energy range for the double bang event is similar .",
    "the ratio @xmath9 can be determined by measuring the muon track to shower ratio@xcite , which is an appropriate observable for underground / undersea neutrino telescopes .",
    "the @xmath5 fraction can be extracted from the measurement of this ratio by assuming flavor independence of the neutrino spectrum and the equality of @xmath6 and @xmath7 fluxes on the earth due to the approximate @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "given such a capability in icecube , we determined the allowed ranges for @xmath3 and @xmath4 as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as the energy of neutrinos goes higher than a few tens of pev , the tau lepton range becomes long enough so that a tau lepton can pass through the detector without decay but losing its energy like a muon does .",
    "in this case , the signal for @xmath7 appears like a track event @xcite .",
    "this leads to the redefinition of @xmath10 as @xmath0 , which can be determined by measuring the ratio of shower events induced by electron neutrinos to track events by muon and tau neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry is then not a necessity to extract the @xmath5 composition .",
    "the capability to measure this shower to track ratio in ara @xcite has been discussed @xcite . with",
    "this ratio measured , one can infer the @xmath5 composition of the astrophysical high energy neutrino flux .",
    "the discrimination between @xmath5 and @xmath11 makes possible the determination of the third row of the q matrix and hence the flavor transition mechanism can be probed .    in this article , we generalize our previous study to the case without @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the @xmath2 representation and present how @xmath10 and the third row of the @xmath2 matrix is related and , hence , the flavor transition mechanism is determined . in sec .",
    "iii , we address the flavor discrimination between @xmath5 and @xmath11 , arguing that the @xmath12 composition can be extracted without further distinguishing between @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the neutrino telescope .",
    "this capability makes @xmath10 a practical and appropriate observable . employing the standard three - flavor oscillation and neutrino decay models as examples , we present their @xmath2 matrices and values of @xmath10 in sec .",
    "iv . these results shall pave the way for later discussions on discriminating different flavor transition models with our model independent parametrization . in sec .",
    "v , we study allowed ranges for the element of @xmath3 , @xmath13 and @xmath4 for example models .",
    "we conclude in sec . vi .",
    "one can write neutrino flux at the source as @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 with the normalisation @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the ranges for the source parameters are given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for sources with negligible @xmath7 fraction , @xmath22",
    ". the neutrino flux reaching the earth is then given by @xmath23 such that @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 with @xmath26 in other words , @xmath2 is related to @xmath27 by a similarity transformation where columns of the transformation matrix @xmath28 correspond to vectors @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are related to the flux of each neutrino flavor by @xmath35 with the normalization @xmath36 .",
    "since we have chosen the normalization @xmath16 for the neutrino flux at the source , the conservation of total neutrino flux during propgations corresponds to @xmath37 . in general flavour transition models",
    ", @xmath32 could be less than @xmath38 as a consequence of ( ordinary ) neutrino decaying into invisible states or oscillating into sterile neutrinos . to rewrite eq .",
    "[ flux ] as @xmath39 it is clearly seen that , for a fixed @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the first row of matrix @xmath2 determines the normalization for the total neutrino flux reaching the earth , the second row of @xmath2 determines the breaking of @xmath1 symmetry in the arrival neutrino flux , and the third row of @xmath2 determines the flux difference @xmath42 .    for those models which preserve the total neutrino flux , @xmath43 in the @xmath2 matrix representation",
    ", these flux - conserving models must give @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the remaining six matrix elements of @xmath2 can be constrained by neutrino telescope measurements .",
    "second , the approximate @xmath1 symmetry makes almost identical the second and third rows of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath46 and also the second and third columns of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath47 . in the @xmath2 matrix representation ,",
    "these properties render @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in summary",
    ", we have seen that the first and second rows of @xmath2 as well as the matrix element @xmath13 are already constrained in a simple way by assuming the conservation of total neutrino flux and the validity of approximate @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "hence under these two assumptions , simply the values for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are enough to classify neutrino flavor transition models and the fraction of @xmath12 can be extracted from the track to shower ratio .",
    "one can therefore probe the transition mechanism with the measurement of the track to shower ratio by neutrino telescopes .",
    "it has been demonstrated that @xcite the event ratio of muon tracks to showers can be used to extract the @xmath12 fraction of astrophysical neutrinos , i.e. , the ratio @xmath9 , with the approximate @xmath1 symmetry . as a result ,",
    "the relevant elements @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be determined and the flavor transition mechanism is tested  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath1 symmetry is broken by the recent confirmation of nonzero @xmath50 with its value larger than most expectations @xcite .",
    "this symmetry holds because of the maximal mixing @xmath51 and zero @xmath50 .",
    "the nonzero @xmath50 with relatively large value should benefit the reconstruction of neutrino flavor ratios at astrophysical sources and the discrimination between different astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "however , without the @xmath1 symmetry , we can not extract the fraction of @xmath12 with the measurement of track to shower event ratio alone and the flavor transition models can not be constrained . in order to extract the fraction of @xmath12 and",
    "then probe the transition mechanism with the @xmath2 matrix parametrization with nonzero @xmath50 , we have to further make a difficult measuremnt of the flux ratio @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the situation can be quite different for ultrahigh energy neutrinos .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that , for the astrophysical neutrinos with energies higher than a few tens of pev , new flux rato should be adopted for the measurements of terrestrial neutrino telescopes . at such high energies ,",
    "the tau lepton originated from the tau neutrino behaves like a track similar to a muon @xcite while the electron neutrino still produces a shower signal .",
    "therefore we are motivated to define more appropriate flux ratio parameters .",
    "meanwhile , radio neutrino telescopes , such as askaryan radio array ( ara ) , are proposed to observe cosmogenic neutrinos of energy about eev by detecting cherenkov radio emissions .",
    "these radiations are emitted by showers originated from the ultrahigh energy neutrinos interacting with matter . for cosmogenic neutrinos ,",
    "the energy of the cc - induced muon or tau lepton is so high that a muon or tau lepton not only emits dim lights but also produce mini - showers along its propagation through the detector fiducial volume .",
    "though the lights emitted from the track can only trigger the nearby optical detectors , a track event can be reconstructed for a muon or tau lepton traversing the detector volume , by detecting the radio emissions from these mini - showers @xcite . a @xmath5 signal of a single",
    ", major shower is therefore distinguishable from a @xmath6 or @xmath7 track , composed of a sequence of sub - showers .",
    "moreover , the shower induced by @xmath5 is an electromagnetic shower while the shower in a @xmath6 or @xmath7 track can be either an electromagnetic shower or a hadronic one .",
    "these two kinds of showers emit cherenkov radiations in different patterns .",
    "the detection of a hadronic signature can further confirm the existence of a track event .    for @xmath53",
    ", the ratio @xmath0 is an appropriate and practical parameter for flavor discrimination in water ( ice ) chenrenkov and radio - wave neutrino detectors .",
    "although it is difficult to discriminate between @xmath6 and @xmath6 , the determination of the new parameter @xmath54 allows one to extract the @xmath12 fraction without assuming the @xmath1 symmetry in radio - wave neutrino telescope experiments .",
    "the direct correspondence between the third row of the @xmath2 matrix and the flux ratio @xmath10 defined for ultra high energy neutrinos implies that the measurement of @xmath10 is already enough to probe the flavor transition mechanism . in the case of the conservation of the total neutrino flux",
    ", one has @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in the high energy regime ,",
    "the remain elements of @xmath2 can be constrained through measuring the ratio @xmath10 . for astrophysical ources with negligible @xmath56 fraction",
    ", we have @xmath22 with parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 defined in eq .",
    "( [ define ] ) .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath10 is a function by @xmath41 such that @xmath57^{-1 } , \\nonumber \\\\            & = & -1+\\frac{3}{2}[1-f_{12}-3f_{23}b]^{-1 } , \\label{rinq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 for the pion and muon - damped sources respectively , @xmath59 solving the above equations , we obtain @xmath60    the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 are good alternatives to @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "flavor transition models can be well classified by @xmath61 and @xmath62 although observations of only two different sources can not completely determine the third row of the @xmath2 matrix .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the @xmath2 matrix is related to the usual flavor transition matrix @xmath27 by a similarity transformation .",
    "the observation of astrophysical neutrinos can probe the elements of the @xmath2 matrix in a model independent fashion .",
    "hence , @xmath63 is also a model independent parametrization of flavor transition .    in the following ,",
    "we illustrate the @xmath63 parametrization using a few flavor transition models as examples . discriminating between models with statistical analysis",
    "is presented in the next section .",
    "we begin by considering the standard three - flavor neutrino oscillation , in which the probability matrix @xmath27 for astrophysical neutrinos traversing a vast distance is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are elements of neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the exact form of @xmath67 in terms of neutrino mixing parameters is given in the appendix of ref .",
    "since @xmath68 in this case , one has @xmath69 .",
    "this implies @xmath70 in addition to @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    for the standard oscillation , @xmath71",
    "thus , @xmath72 to the first order of @xmath73 , @xmath74      flavor transitions of astrophysical neutrinos due to effects of neutrino decays were discussed extensively in ref . [ 6 ] .",
    "the simplest case of neutrino decays is that both the heaviest ( _ h _ ) and the middle ( _ m _ ) mass eigenstates decay into the lightest ( _ l _ ) mass eigenstate .",
    "if branching ratios of @xmath75 and @xmath76are both 100% , the @xmath2 matrix is given by [ 26 ] @xmath77 where @xmath78 for the normal mass hierarchy and @xmath79 for the inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "obviously , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "to the first order of @xmath82 , the parameters relevant to observations are given by @xmath83 for @xmath78 and @xmath84 for @xmath79 .",
    "one may consider gene branching ratios for @xmath75 and @xmath76 decays .",
    "however , the resulting neutrino flavor ratio on earth remains the same in such a scenario .",
    "we next consider the decay scenario that @xmath85 decays into both @xmath86 and @xmath87 with branching ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively while @xmath86 does not decay into @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath90 corresponds to the flux conservation case , which we shall adopt in the following discussions on decay models . to the first order of @xmath91 and @xmath92 ,",
