    "since its discovery , spin glass has been considered as a third distinct type of low - temperature magnetic arrangement in solids , in addition to ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic @xcite . in spin glass , spins are disordered , prompting the term `` glass '' , and give zero net magnetic moment .",
    "great theoretical effort went into understanding the nature of the spin glass transition .",
    "the collection of new ideas and theories has formed a new large research field in condensed matter physics , with connections proposed to other disciplines such as economics and biology @xcite .",
    "a couple of decades ago , it was remarked that `` as fame and topicality diminish , the problem remains an interesting , yet pass , research topic '' @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for continued interest in this area is the presence of fundamental theoretical problems that are not resolved .",
    "there is also current interest in new systems such as magnetic nanoparticles , ferrofluids , relaxor ferroelectrics and so on , where spin glass behavior is observed .",
    "the main signature of the spin glass transition is the susceptibility cusp , which is considered to mark the transition from the paramagnetic to the spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "the temperature at which the cusp develops is called spin glass transition temperature , @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 )",
    ". the susceptibility cusp has stimulated approaches to spin glass transition based on the existence of a phase transition at @xmath3 , between the high - temperature paramagnetic phase and a novel low - temperature `` spin glass '' phase .",
    "this was primarily inspired by the phase transition theory , centered at the changes of system properties at the phase transition temperature @xcite .",
    "the traditional phase transition theory requires the presence of two distinct phases on both sides of the phase transition @xcite . on the other hand , as detailed studies revealed",
    ", there is no obvious distinct second phase in the spin glass transition : the structure of the low - temperature spin - glass phase is not different from the high - temperature paramagnetic phase , and is equally disordered .",
    "the absence of a second phase presents a problem with viewing spin glass transition as a phase transition , resulting in persisting difficulties and controversies @xcite . to circumvent the problem , popular theories introduced and discussed novel non - conventional order parameters @xcite while retaining the view that a phase transition of some sort takes place .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that well - established methods of statistical mechanics can be used to calculate system equilibrium properties and their derivatives such as susceptibility .",
    "such was the edwards - anderson ( ea ) theory @xcite which introduced the new order parameter for spin glass : @xmath5 , where superscripts @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote two different moments of time for spin @xmath8 .",
    "as introduced , @xmath9 serves to quantify the difference between the mobile spins in the paramagnetic phase and the frozen spins in the glass phase at @xmath3 .",
    "notably , @xmath9 describes the change in dynamic behaviour but not the difference between two distinct equilibrium phases as in the conventional phase transition theory .",
    "the important next step in the ea theory is the substitution of the time average by the ensemble average , by making an assumption that the system is in equilibrium and is ergodic .",
    "subsequently , statistical mechanics is used to calculate system s equilibrium thermodynamic functions .",
    "the ea theory was followed by numerous theoretical studies that introduced new ideas , concepts and novel mathematical frameworks aimed at clarifying and understanding the unconventional nature of the spin - glass phase transition , the low - temperature phase and the ea order parameter @xcite .",
    "importantly , similar to the ea theory , current approaches are based on the existence of a second distinct spin glass phase and a phase transition of some sort , and discuss the associated order parameters .",
    "consequently , the predominant current view is that spin glass transition is a thermodynamic phase transition , even though unconventional @xcite .",
    "several outstanding problems remain with the phase transition approach .",
    "an essential problem rests with identifying the nature of the spin glass phase .",
    "this begs the important question of whether experimental data can be understood without making the assumption that a distinct spin glass phase exists .",
    "another important issue is the conflict between theory and experiments @xcite .",
    "experiments widely show strong dynamic effects . @xmath3",
    "significantly increases with field frequency , or as observation time decreases @xcite .",
    "this is inconsistent with a transition between two equilibrium phases @xcite .",
    "we note at this point that the same effect is seen in the liquid - glass ( structural ) transition @xcite .",
    "in addition to the susceptibility cusp , other properties of spin glass systems have been studied , but have not lead to a conclusive evidence for a phase transition @xcite .",
    "for example , magnetic heat capacity shows no anomaly at @xmath3 , unlike in a phase transition @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of non - linear susceptibility , @xmath10 , above @xmath3 is interpreted to be consistent with critical scaling and is taken as evidence for the static phase transition at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is shared by most authors @xcite , although others are more cautious @xcite .",
    "it is noted that scaling exists away from @xmath3 only , but fails close to @xmath3 where @xmath10 flattens off , inconsistent with a phase transition picture @xcite .",
    "there are other problems with analyzing this and other similar scaling data : first , the choice of @xmath3 is arbitrary because @xmath3 is not fixed but depends on observation time , introducing arbitrariness in the scaling analysis .",
    "this applies not only to the interpretation of experiments , but also to extensive simulations of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "in particular , as larger times are accessed in the simulations , @xmath3 decreases as expected from the experiments , altering critical exponents , lower critical dimension and so on @xcite , and thus suggesting that no firm values of these quantities can be asserted .",
    "second , a phase transition is accompanied by the scaling behavior , but the opposite does not generally need to be the case .",
    "consequently , the scaling behavior is seen in spin glass simulations where the phase transition is known to be absent @xcite , weakening the evidence for a phase transition from the scaling data . finally , the system is not in equilibrium at and below @xmath3 , so it is not known that the scaling data are related to a new phase @xcite .",
    "we note that slow non - equilibrium relaxation effects could precede a true phase transition as well ( eg paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ) , however in this case the presence of the distinct low - temperature phase is known experimentally .",
    "the non - equilibrium state of the spin glass system generally complicates the approach based on a phase transition . in both experiments and simulations , relaxation time @xmath2 continuously increases on lowering the temperature @xcite , as is the case in the structural glass transition . at a certain temperature ,",
    "@xmath2 exceeds observation time , at which point the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "this presents a problem for understanding experimental systems using statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this problem and other issues discussed above , including the increase of @xmath3 with field frequency , remain unresolved at present @xcite .",
    "notably , profound non - equilibrium dynamic effects as well as thermodynamic anomalies are observed in both spin and structural glass transitions .",
    "interestingly , the current view of the two phenomena is markedly different .",
    "the predominant opinion is that the structural glass transition is not a phase transition , and is a purely dynamic effect despite the heat capacity jump at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the current view also holds that the spin glass transition is a phase transition , the unconventionality of which comes from the dynamic effects @xcite . for example",
    ", mydosh asks : `` how can we get rid of the dynamical processes to determine the basic properties of the underlying phase transition ? at present an answer has not yet appeared '' @xcite .    in this paper , we propose that instead of attempting to get rid of universal and profound dynamic effects in order to discuss the underlying phase transition , a more fruitful approach is to consider that the dynamic effects are at the heart of the spin glass transition . in this approach , we explore whether the main experimental results can be understood in an entirely dynamic picture .",
    "contrary to the assumption currently held @xcite , we propose that paramagnetic and spin glass states are qualitatively the same .",
    "consequently , we do not discuss a phase transition of some sort , and therefore do not face complications and controversies surrounding the nature of the spin glass phase and a phase transition @xcite .",
    "we propose that the central experimental result , the susceptibility cusp , necessarily originates when a system stops relaxing at the experimental time scale . in this picture",
    ", the observed cusp marks the _ crossover _ that separates two time regimes , high - temperature relaxational regime @xmath11 and low - temperature spin wave regime @xmath12 , where @xmath1 is the observation time and @xmath2 is system relaxation time .",
    "time - dependent effects , inconsistent with the phase transition approach , and the logarithmic increase of @xmath3 with field frequency in particular , originate as the immediate consequence of the proposed picture .",
    "our proposal thus represents a new outlook at the problem in which the experimental data can be interpreted in a way that is simpler and more physically transparent , an attractive possibility in view of persisting difficulties and controversies in the field .    in our discussion , we explore close parallels between the spin glass transition and the structural glass transition .",
    "importantly , we do so opposite to the historical trend when the insights from the existing spin glass theories were used to understand the structural glass transition ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "these previous approaches invoked the concepts from the spin glass transition theories based on phase transitions and subsequently applied them to the structural glass transition .",
    "consequently , the structural glass transition was related to a phase transition of some sort . on the other hand ,",
    "we start from a recent picture which explains the structural glass transition as a purely dynamic phenomenon , without any reference to a distinct solid glass phase or a phase transition @xcite .",
    "we subsequently propose that the spin glass transition can equally be understood as a purely dynamic phenomenon .",
    "the next section outlines the recent dynamic approach to structural glass transition , followed by our proposal that the same general idea can be used to understand the spin glass transition .",
    "in the field of spin glass transition , the most commonly discussed effect is the cusp of susceptibility at @xmath3 . in the area of structural glass transition @xcite , the response of a system",
    "is measured to the heat flow , and is quantified by heat capacity .",
    "if a liquid avoids crystallization on cooling , the heat capacity changes with a jump at the glass transition temperature @xmath3 . for various liquids , @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constant - pressure liquid and glass heat capacities , respectively .",
    "the jump of @xmath16 provides one definition of @xmath3 at which the glass is said to form .",
    "because above and below @xmath3 the system structure is equally disordered , the jump of @xmath16 immediately presents a problem that is at the heart of glass transition @xcite : how can the jump be understood if there is no distinct second phase ?",
    "this problem remains unresolved , resulting in several important and interesting controversies @xcite .",
    "one set of theories rationalize the jump of heat capacity by relating it to the existence of a phase transition and using the concepts from the phase transitions theory .",
    "this approach has been convincingly criticized for a number of reasons ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "perhaps the most important reason is that it has not been possible to identify a distinct low - temperature phase , the glass phase . to get round this problem ,",
    "several theories have put forward the proposals about the non - conventional mechanisms of the phase transition and non - trivial descriptions of the second phase , while retaining the idea of a phase transition in general @xcite .",
    "another set of glass transition theories maintain that glass transition phenomena at @xmath3 have purely dynamic origin , corresponding to the freezing of atomic jumps in a liquid at the experimental time scale @xcite .",
    "the assumed absence of a phase transition and thermodynamic anomalies is supported by the wide experimental observation that the liquid and the glass structures at @xmath3 are nearly identical @xcite . however , the challenge for these theories is to explain the origin of the heat capacity jump at @xmath3 as well as its large magnitude , which can be of the order of @xmath17 per atom .",
    "we have recently proposed @xcite how to explain the jump of heat capacity in a purely dynamic picture , without asserting the existence of a distinct phase and a phase transition of some sort and , therefore , showed how to reconcile the above contradiction .",
    "we recall that glass transition temperature @xmath3 has two experimental definitions which give similar values of @xmath3 . in the calorimetry experiments , @xmath3 is the temperature at which the jump of @xmath16 is measured . in the experiments that measure liquid relaxation time @xmath2 ( e.g. dielectric relaxation experiments ) , @xmath3 is the temperature at which @xmath2 exceeds the experimental time @xmath1 of typically @xmath18 s @xcite .",
    "we proposed that when @xmath2 exceeds @xmath1 , the jump of heat capacity at @xmath3 follows as a necessary consequence due to the change of liquid elastic , vibrational and thermal properties including the bulk modulus and thermal expansion .",
    "therefore , the jump of @xmath16 at @xmath3 is the result of the dynamic crossover rather than a phase transition .",
    "consequently , there is no need to invoke a second glass phase , a phase transition of some sort and face associated problems .",
    "we first discuss why and how liquid thermal expansion coefficient @xmath19 and bulk modulus @xmath20 change at @xmath3 . unlike in a solid , atoms in a liquid are not fixed , but rearrange in space .",
    "this gives the liquid its ability to flow .",
    "each flow event is a jump of an atom from its surrounding atomic `` cage '' , accompanied by large - scale rearrangement of the cage atoms .",
    "we call this process a local relaxation event ( lre ) .",
    "a lre lasts on the order of elementary ( debye ) vibration period @xmath21 ps .",
    "frenkel introduced liquid relaxation time @xmath2 as the time between lres in a liquid at one point in space @xcite .",
    "smaller and larger @xmath2 correspond to smaller and larger liquid viscosities , respectively . basing on this property only , frenkel concluded that at short times @xmath12 , liquid response is the same as that of a solid , i.e. is purely elastic . on the other hand , for @xmath11 , viscous liquid flow takes place , during which each lre gives the additional , viscous , displacement .",
    "hence , for @xmath11 , liquid response to external perturbation ( e.g. pressure ) consists of both elastic and viscous response @xcite .",
    "this picture provided the microscopic basis for the earlier phenomenological model of maxwell @xcite , who proposed to separate elastic and viscous response in his viscoelastic approach to liquids .",
    "lets consider that a liquid is subject to pressure @xmath22 .",
    "pressure induces a certain number of lres , which bring the liquid to equilibrium at new external conditions ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) after time @xmath2 .",
    "as follows from the maxwell - frenkel approach , the change of liquid volume , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 correspond to solid - like elastic deformation and viscous relaxation process due to lres , respectively .",
    "lets define @xmath3 as the temperature at which @xmath2 exceeds the observation time @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that lres do not operate at @xmath3 during the time of observation .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 at @xmath3 is given by purely elastic displacement as in elastic solid .",
    "then , @xmath28 and @xmath29 above and below @xmath3 , respectively , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bulk moduli of the liquid and the glass , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are initial volumes of the liquid and the glass , and @xmath34 is the elastic deformation of the glass .",
    "let @xmath35 be a narrow temperature interval that separates the liquid from the glass so that @xmath2 in the liquid , @xmath36 , is @xmath37 and @xmath38 . then , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . combining the expressions for @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we find :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the ratio of relaxational and elastic response to pressure .",
    "the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be calculated in a similar way , giving @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the ratio of relaxational and elastic response to temperature .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) describe the relationships between @xmath20 and @xmath19 in the liquid and the glass due to the presence of lres in the liquid above @xmath3 and their absence in the glass at and below @xmath3 , as long as @xmath3 is the temperature at which @xmath12 .",
    "we note that @xmath31 and @xmath44 can be called unrelaxed , or non - equilibrium values , of bulk modulus and thermal expansion , respectively , because relaxational response @xmath27 in the glass decays during time @xmath2 .",
    "we now relate the jump of constant - pressure heat capacity , @xmath16 , to the corresponding changes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath3 .",
    "we write @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the constant - volume heat capacity .",
    "we note that @xmath48 around @xmath3 , or at any temperature where @xmath49 , is essentially due to the vibrational motion because the relative number of diffusing atoms is proportional to @xmath50 , and is therefore negligibly small @xcite . using the grneisen approximation ,",
    "we have shown that @xmath51 @xcite .    as discussed above ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are different above @xmath3 when @xmath11 and below @xmath3 when @xmath12 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 2]-[3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the two different time regimes give different values of @xmath16 :    @xmath52    @xmath53    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to liquid and glass , respectively .",
    "( [ 31]-[32 ] ) relate the change of heat capacity to the changes of @xmath19 and @xmath20 due to the presence of relaxational response in the liquid and its absence in the glass . using the experimental values of @xmath44 , @xmath43 , @xmath31 and @xmath30",
    ", we have shown that the calculated values of the liquid and glass @xmath54 according to eqs .",
    "( [ 31],[32 ] ) are in reasonable agreement with the experimental @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "importantly , the jump of heat capacity at @xmath3 in our theory takes place within the same single thermodynamic liquid phase , but below and above @xmath3 the liquid is characterized by different values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 due to the freezing of lres at @xmath3 where the liquid falls out of equilibrium . therefore , our theory is purely dynamic .",
    "in contrast to previous theories of glass transition @xcite , we do not discuss transitions between distinct thermodynamic phases , even though it may be tempting to invoke phase transitions , conventional or unconventional , in order to explain the origin of heat capacity jump . instead , the jump of heat capacity in this picture is due to the _ crossover _ between two different regimes , relaxational regime above @xmath3 and elastic regime below @xmath3 . as we have shown earlier",
    ", the crossover may be sharp enough if small variations of temperature around @xmath3 give large changes of @xmath2 , leading to the freezing of lres in a narrow temperature range and giving the appearance of a phase transition @xcite .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail , our theory predicts no difference of @xmath16 between the liquid and the glass at long times when both systems are in equilibrium . in this case ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 , giving @xmath57 .",
    "we note that reaching such an equilibrium state for common glasses can take astronomical times and longer .",
    "for example , lets consider sio@xmath58 glass at room temperature @xmath59=300 k. the activation energy barrier @xmath60 can be assumed constant , because sio@xmath58 is a `` strong '' liquid @xcite .",
    "then , combining @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we write @xmath63 . taking @xmath640.1 ps , @xmath65 k and @xmath66 s , we find @xmath67 s , approximately the fourth power of the age of the universe .",
    "although solid for any practical purpose , sio@xmath58 at room temperature is an equilibrium liquid during times @xmath68 .",
    "consequently , it shows no jump of heat capacity on cooling from high temperature if @xmath68 .",
    "the dynamic origin of the jump of @xmath16 at @xmath3 in our theory explains a well - known effect that @xmath3 logarithmically increases with the quench rate @xmath69 , where @xmath35 is the temperature interval above @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "according to our theory , the jump of heat capacity at @xmath3 takes place when the observation time @xmath1 crosses relaxation time @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that @xmath2 at which the jump of heat capacity takes place is @xmath70 .",
    "combining this with @xmath71 ( here @xmath60 is nearly constant because @xmath2 is approximately arrhenius around @xmath3 @xcite ) gives    @xmath72    according to eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) , @xmath3 increases with the logarithm of @xmath9 , as widely observed in the experiments .",
    "furthermore , the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath9 is consistent with the experimental results @xcite ) .",
    "this is the immediate and important result of our theory .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) predicts no divergence of @xmath3 because the maximal physically possible quench rate is set by the minimal elementary time @xmath73 ( debye vibration period ) so that @xmath74 is always larger than @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) .",
    "our main proposal is that , similar to the jump of @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath16 in the structural glass transition , the susceptibility cusp in the spin glass transition is not related to the existence of a distinct spin glass phase and a phase transition of any sort .",
    "instead , we propose that the cusp is the result of the _ crossover _ between the two regimes , the high - temperature relaxational regime and low - temperature spin wave elastic - like regime , when observation time @xmath1 exceeds system relaxation time @xmath2 . in this picture , the crossover is a purely dynamic effect that takes place within the same single phase .",
    "similar to liquids , we define @xmath2 as the time between two consecutive spin jumps ( large - scale spin rearrangements in classical picture or transitions between states with different spin quantum numbers ) that play the role of lres in a liquid . when @xmath11 at high temperature , spin lres are operative , governing the dynamics of the system . in this regime ,",

    "as in structural glass transition , two main effects that set in above @xmath3 in spin glass systems are the vft law mentioned above and stretched - exponential relaxation ( ser ) . in liquids , slow relaxation sets in at high temperature @xmath130 where @xmath2 is on the order of picoseconds @xcite . above @xmath130 ,",
    "relaxation is exponential .",
    "it was assumed or postulated that ser is due to some sort of cooperativity of molecular relaxation in a liquid that sets in on temperature decrease , but the physical origin of cooperativity has remained unknown .    we have recently proposed @xcite that the physical origin of the vft law and ser in a liquid is the elastic _ interaction _ between lres .",
    "large atomic displacements due to the lre distort the surrounding liquid and induce elastic waves .",
    "the wave frequency , @xmath115 , is on the order of debye frequency because the wavelength is on the order of interatomic separations , implying that @xmath131 in the range of @xmath2 relevant for glass transition .",
    "as discussed by frenkel @xcite , waves with frequency @xmath131 propagate in a liquid as in a solid .",
    "the waves distort cages around other lre centres in the liquid , and therefore affect their relaxation .",
    "hence , we identified elastic waves as the physical mechanism of mediating interaction , and proposed @xcite that this interaction sets the cooperativity of relaxation whose origin was discussed @xcite but not understood from the physical point of view . the key question is the range of this interaction .",
    "as discussed in detail @xcite , this range is given by @xmath132 :    @xmath133    where @xmath87 is the speed of sound .",
    "the non - trivial point is that @xmath134 _ increases _ with @xmath2 .",
    "this is directly opposite to the commonly discussed decay of hydrodynamic waves , whose propagation range varies as @xmath135 .",
    "the difference is due to the solid - like regime of wave propagation , @xmath136 , which is qualitatively different from the hydrodynamic regime , @xmath137 .",
    "we called @xmath132 liquid elasticity length because it defines the range over which two lres interact with each other via induced elastic waves .",
    "importantly , @xmath134 _ increases _ on lowering the temperature because @xmath2 increases .",
    "we proposed that this is the key to the origin of slow relaxation , the vft law @xcite as well as ser @xcite .",
    "as such , the above mechanism is general enough to describe relaxation in any dynamic system where local entities relax and induce mediating waves ( elastic , spin or other ) that affect relaxation of other entities in the system .",
    "hence , we propose that the same mechanism operates in spin glass systems . here , a localized spin rearrangement induces a spin wave that affects relaxation of other spins in the system .",
    "when @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the characteristic distance between the neighbouring spins , spin lres do not interact , resulting in exponential and arrhenius relaxation as expected .",
    "however , when @xmath140 on lowering the temperature , interaction between spin lres sets in .",
    "similar to liquids , we propose that this interaction is responsible for the vft law and ser seen in spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "( [ del ] ) predicts that , similarly to liquids @xcite , two dynamic crossovers in spin glass systems operate at @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where @xmath87 is the speed of spin wave and @xmath143 is system size .",
    "the first crossover is from exponential ( non - cooperative ) to non - exponential ( cooperative ) relaxation .",
    "the second crossover is from the vft to a more arrhenius relaxation when @xmath132 reaches system size @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to structural glass transition , the dynamic crossovers in spin glass systems have not been experimentally studied in detail .",
    "therefore , our prediction can be investigated in future high - temperature experiments in spin glass systems .",
    "we note that this picture predicts that @xmath2 and @xmath3 increase with @xmath143 when @xmath144 , provided that the thermalization length of the spin wave is larger than @xmath132 .",
    "seen in supercooled liquids @xcite , this effect is also seen in spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "consistent with the proposed picture , it also supports the possibility of the second crossover at @xmath142 .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed to take a new outlook at the spin glass transition problem , in view of persisting difficulties and controversies in the field .",
    "we proposed to interpret existing and future experimental data in a way that is simpler and more physically transparent .",
    "there is certainly more work to be done to clarify how the proposed ideas apply to the wealth of spin glass systems and phenomena .",
    "we have argued that the structural and spin glass transition are similar , but in a different way than previously thought . instead of asserting that the spin glass transition is related to a phase transition and order parameters and rolling out this approach to the structural glass transition @xcite , we proposed that the structural glass transition can be understood as an entirely dynamic phenomenon , and subsequently suggested that equally can the spin glass transition .",
    "we generally remark that a phase transition between two distinct equilibrium phases results in the change of system properties , a well - studied and understood topic in physics @xcite .",
    "however , there are many examples , including in structural and spin glass transition , where the system equally changes many of its important properties at a certain temperature , yet the second phase and the order parameter are not apparent , the nature of the phase transition is not clear and the system shows profound dynamic effects .",
    "we have proposed that in this case , the change of system properties can be understood as an entirely dynamic phenomenon with no reference to a phase transition of some sort and order parameters . in this simple picture ,",
    "system properties change at the dynamic crossover when the system stops relaxing at the experimental time scale when @xmath0 .    finally , we have explored closed similarities between relaxation properties of liquids and spin glass systems above @xmath3 and proposed that slow relaxation effects are due to interactions between spin lres via induced spin waves .",
    "this can stimulate future experiments to study high - temperature relaxation effects in spin glass systems ."
