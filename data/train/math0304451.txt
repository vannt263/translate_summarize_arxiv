    "first item means that the homoclinic class @xmath138 do not have any dominated splitting , and that this property is robust .",
    "so theorem  [ t.bdp ] shows that @xmath138 admits periodic points whose derivative can be perturbated in order to get an homothecy .",
    "second item above allows to choose this point having a jacobian ( at the period ) arbitrarily close to @xmath79 .",
    "then a new pertubation allows to get a periodic point whose derivative at the period is the identity .",
    "considering then perturbations of the identity map , we get :    @xcite there is a residual part @xmath20 of the open set @xmath135 defined above , such that any @xmath56 admits an infinite family of periodic disks @xmath140 ( let @xmath141 denote the period ) , whose orbits are pairwize disjoint , and verifying the universal following property :    given any @xmath0-open set @xmath142 of diffeomorphisms from the disk @xmath143 to its interior @xmath144 , there is @xmath123 such that the restriction of @xmath145 to the disk @xmath140 is smoothly conjugated to an element of @xmath142 .",
    "notice that the set of diffeomorphisms @xmath146 contains an open subset @xmath147 verifying the property of @xmath135 described above , one get some kind of renormalisation process : there is a residual part of @xmath135 containing infinitely many periodic disks @xmath140 containing each of them infinitely many periodic subdisks themself containing infinitely many periodic subdisks and so on ... in that way one build a tree such that each branch is a sequence ( decreasing for the inclusion ) , of strictly periodic orbits of disks whose periods go to infinity , and whose radius go to zero .",
    "the intersection of this sequence is a lyapunov stable ( and so saturated ) transitif compact set , conjugated to an _ adding machine _",
    "( see for instance @xcite for this notion ) and so without periodic orbits .",
    "the set of the infinite branches of this tree is uncountable , given the following result :    @xcite given any compact manifold @xmath1 of dimension @xmath133 , there is an open subset @xmath62 of @xmath17 and a residual part @xmath148 of @xmath62 , such that any @xmath149 admits an uncountable family of saturated transitif sets without periodic orbits.[t.sauvage ]    aa f. abdenur , generic robustness of spectral decompositions , _ preprint impa _ , ( 2001 ) r. abraham and s. smale , non - genericity of @xmath150-stability , _ global analysis , vol xiv of proc .",
