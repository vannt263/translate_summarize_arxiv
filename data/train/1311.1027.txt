    "determinantal point process stems back from 1975 when o. maachi introduce it as the ` fermion ' process with repulsive feature on its points .",
    "it is only in the last two decades that soshnikov(2000 ) @xcite and shirai and takahashi(2003)@xcite studied further on the mathematical properties of the process structure .",
    "classical modeling of repulsive point processes are in essence through gibbs point processes . since their introduction , dpp have found many applications in random matrix theory and quantum physics .",
    "simulations of determinantal point processes are mostly based on the idea of hough et al . in @xcite and further discussed in details in @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of the idea is due to its large rejections in the sampling . on the other hand , in a markov chain monte carlo method , many of the simulation algorithms are based on the long - running constructions of markov chain that converges to an equilibrium distribution .",
    "the difficulties was in determining the number of steps needed to have such a convergence .",
    "thanks to propp and wilson @xcite , which suggest with the application of coupling theory , we are able to ` exactly ' simulate a finite state markov chain with the desired equilibrium distribution .",
    "although perfect simulation is obviously appealing but we share a common drawback with @xcite idea : given a dpp kernel with no explicitly known spectral representation , the statistics ( papangelou conditional intensity ) involve in the configurations , it is not simple to extract them from . in general numerical techniques such as fourier expansion are required because of the limitation of analytical results .",
    "this paper serves as the continuation of work on @xcite and @xcite in simulating dpp ; in @xcite uses the cftp perfect simulation approach on spatial point processes , while here we analyze the application of cftp simulation on determinantal point processes and we provide a lower and a upper bound for the coalescence time in general case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : pre ] by summarizing the basic notation and recall the definition of a point process , including determinantal point process and its papangelou conditional intensity .",
    "section [ sec : simulation ] is devoted to details of perfect simulation of dpp via dominated coupling of markov chains , i.e. cftp . in section [ sec : runtime ] , we discuss the limiting behavior of the running time of cftp simulation and provide a bound for the limiting sequence .",
    "lastly in section [ sec : app ] , we apply cftp algorithm to three stationary dpp models defined by the commonly used covariance functions in multivariate statistical analysis , i.e. gaussian model , matrn model and the cauchy model .    the statistical analysis conducted in this paper",
