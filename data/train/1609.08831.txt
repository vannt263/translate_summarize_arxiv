    "in phase transitions , the range of the interactions plays an important role .",
    "models with interactions decaying as a negative power @xmath7 of the distance appear to display a considerable variety of universality classes as a function of @xmath8 , and as a function of the dimensionality @xcite .",
    "for large @xmath8 the interactions decay fast and one finds the usual short - range universal behavior . for sufficiently small @xmath8",
    "the interactions decay only slowly and one finds mean - field - like critical behavior . for intermediate values of @xmath8",
    "the critical exponents may depend continuously on @xmath8 .    a different way to modify the range of the interactions",
    "is specified in the so - called equivalent - neighbor models , in which the pair interactions are constant up to a range @xmath9 and then abruptly fall to zero .",
    "following ref .  , we refer to these models as medium - range models . in the limit @xmath10 , the equivalent - neighbor model reduces to the mean field model ; for sufficiently small @xmath9 it will naturally display the usual short - range universal behavior .",
    "but it seems that the analogy with the case of power - law decay of interactions ends here .",
    "medium - range ising models , with interactions of a variable range @xmath9 display uniform crossover from the vicinity of the mean - field fixed point at @xmath11 to the ising critical fixed point at small @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the model belongs to the ising universality class for all finite @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling field parametrizing the crossover phenomenon is the irrelevant ising temperature field .",
    "the flow diagram for the ising model is shown in fig .",
    "[ ising ] .",
    "8.4 cm    the question naturally arises whether such a uniform crossover also occurs in the more general context of the @xmath12-state potts model @xcite , of which the ising model is the special case with @xmath13 .",
    "another possibility is suggested by the renormalization scenario for the two - dimensional dilute @xmath12-state potts model @xcite with @xmath14 . in this context the leading irrelevant field , parametrizing the critical surface in parameter space , is controlled by the activity of the vacancies .",
    "when the latter parameter is increased , while adjusting the potts coupling to maintain criticality , a threshold occurs where the model becomes tricritical . beyond the threshold",
    "the ordering transition becomes discontinuous . if the parameters controlling the irrelevant fields of the dilute and the equivalent - neighbor potts models are sufficiently analogous for @xmath15 , then this scenario , i.e. , a tricritical point separating a range of critical and a range of first - order transitions , might also occur for the equivalent - neighbor potts model .",
    "this is not a new idea .",
    "it was already raised by hilhorst @xcite in a discussion following the renormalization results for the potts model with vacancies @xcite .",
    "this possibility is also in line with work of biskup et al .",
    "@xcite which concerns @xmath0 models with interactions whose strength decays smoothly to zero at infinite range . for a sufficiently slow decay , a first - order transition is predicted .",
    "it is also in line with results of gobron and merola @xcite for the mean - field potts model perturbed with a kac potential . in order to provide quantitative answers to the similar question for a simple potts model system ,",
    "we consider the equivalent - neighbor model with a finite but variable interaction range @xmath9 , described by the reduced hamiltonian @xmath16 where the potts variables @xmath17 carry indices that refer to the sites of a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "interacting pairs of sites are selected by the step function @xmath18 ( defined by @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , interactions of strength @xmath23 occur with all neighbors within a distance @xmath9 . in this work , we specify the interaction range @xmath24 by the number @xmath1 of equivalent - neighbors interacting with a spin on a @xmath25-dimensional lattice .",
    "in particular we investigate the @xmath0 and the @xmath4 potts model on @xmath26 square lattices for a sequence of finite sizes @xmath27 .",
    "this task is performed numerically , by means of a cluster monte carlo method @xcite that is especially suitable for this problem , because it not only reduces critical slowing down , but it also remains very efficient for systems with interactions of a long range . during the simulations , we sampled the densities @xmath28 of the potts variables in state @xmath29 , from which we obtained the magnetization moments and the binder ratio @xcite , as explained in sec .",
    "we use finite - size scaling @xcite to analyze these data to obtain the location of the phase transitions and their universality classes . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show the results for the @xmath0 potts model , for several values of @xmath1 in the range @xmath30 .",
    "results for several @xmath4 potts models with @xmath31 are presented in sec .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are listed in sec .",
    "the main results of the present article appeared earlier in the phd thesis of one of us @xcite .",
    "the principle of the monte carlo technique employed for the study of the present two - dimensional medium - range potts models was explained in detail in ref .   for the ising case @xmath13 , and it can be trivially generalized to @xmath15 potts models .",
    "the algorithm is organized such that it requires a computer time that is almost independent of the number @xmath1 of interacting neighbors per spin .",
    "we used the wolff - like single - cluster version @xcite of the algorithm .",
    "since the locations of the phase transitions are unknown for general @xmath1 , our first task is to determine them .",
    "this determination is based on the monte carlo sampling of the moments of the magnetization density @xmath32 .",
    "this quantity depends on the densities @xmath28 of the potts states @xmath33 as @xmath34 this definition is in accordance with the interpretation of the potts spins as vectors with @xmath12 equivalent orientations in @xmath35 dimensional spin space .",
    "the magnetization moments determine a dimensionless ratio @xmath36 , related to the binder cumulant @xcite , defined as : @xmath37 the expected finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath36 near the transition point is obtained by expansion of the scaling formula for the free energy near the pertinent critical or tricritical fixed point .",
    "this leads to @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a universal constant , @xmath41 is the renormalization exponent describing the scaling of the temperature field , and the @xmath42 with @xmath43 are negative exponents describing corrections that will be discussed later , and the @xmath44 , the @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath25 are unknown amplitudes .",
    "the term with amplitude @xmath25 describes the nonlinearity of the temperature field as a function of @xmath23 .    in the case of the four - state potts model",
    ", the behavior is less simple because of the presence of a marginal operator , as predicted by the renormalization scenario due to nienhuis et al .",
    "@xcite . from a further analysis of the renormalization equations @xcite , it is possible to predict the finite - size - scaling behavior of the singular part of free energy as a function of the temperature scaling field @xmath47 , the magnetic scaling field @xmath48 , and the marginal field @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 $ ] . since the magnetization moments can be expressed in terms of derivatives of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field , one",
    "can also obtain the expected scaling behavior of @xmath36 . in leading orders",
    "one finds that , for @xmath52 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , thus @xmath56 as well .",
    "the proportionality constants are universal but unknown .",
    "the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath36 near the transition point follows by additional differentiation of @xmath57 to the temperature field as @xmath58 where @xmath59 , with universal but unknown proportionality constants .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 is a useful quantity to locate phase transitions and to determine the associated temperature - like exponent .",
    "from eq .",
    "( [ drq ] ) one finds that the @xmath36 versus @xmath23 curves for different values of the finite - size parameter @xmath27 intersect at values approaching @xmath52 for large @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the slopes of these curves are asymptotically proportional to @xmath60 , which thus allows the estimation of @xmath41 .    for each model ,",
    "simulations were performed for several system sizes in a suitable range of @xmath23 near criticality , and @xmath61 or more samples were taken for each data point specified by @xmath12 , @xmath23 and @xmath1 .",
    "the intersections of finite - size data for @xmath36 versus @xmath23 , taken at different values of @xmath27 but for the same @xmath12 and @xmath1 , reveal the location of the critical point .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ k8n ] for the @xmath0 potts model with @xmath3 , i.e. , nearest- and next - nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "12.0 cm    a more accurate location was determined by a least - squares analysis according to eq .",
    "( [ drq ] ) .",
    "similar analyses were performed for the other choices of @xmath12 and @xmath1 investigated in the present work .",
    "we have also searched for possible evidence , in the form of hysteresis loops , for first - order transitions at a finite interaction range .",
    "we thus determined the behavior of the energy and the magnetization while the coupling @xmath23 was changed in small steps separated by long intervals .",
    "furthermore we investigated the autocorrelation time @xmath62 , and the distributions @xmath63 of the energy and @xmath64 of the magnetization .",
    "the binder ratio @xmath36 is assumed to be universal for critical potts models with the same @xmath12 , but this universal number still depends on the geometry of the finite system .",
    "the relevant factors are the ratio of the microscopic couplings in different directions , the boundary conditions and the shape of the system , for instance the aspect ratio of a rectangular periodic box . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems with square symmetry , which pertains to the lattice , the couplings and to the boundary conditions . the universal value of @xmath40 can therefore conveniently be determined from the nearest - neighbor potts model , for which we know the exact critical point as @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore simulated the nearest - neighbor three - state potts model at the critical point , using square systems with sizes @xmath66 , 7 , 8 , ... , 280 , 320 .",
    "we fitted the finite - size data by eq .",

    ", we also simulated the dilute potts model to determine @xmath40 for the three - state potts model near the critical fixed point , which is located @xcite at @xmath70 , @xmath71 . at the critical fixed point ,",
    "the leading correction term with exponent @xmath72 is suppressed . for the model at the critical fixed point",
    ", we simulated 21 systems @xmath66 , 8 , 10 , ... , 150 , 210 , and obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this value is close to an expected correction exponent @xmath75 .",
    "the values of the magnetic exponents @xmath76 and @xmath77 are given in ref .",
    "when we fix the correction exponent at the value @xmath78 , we obtain @xmath79 .",
    "these relatively accurate results for @xmath40 will be useful for the analysis of models with more neighbors .",
    "we also simulated the dilute potts model to determine @xmath40 at the tricritical point of the three - state potts model , which is located @xcite near @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "for the tricritical dilute potts model we used system sizes @xmath66 , 8 , 10 , ... , 84 , 108 . fits with fixed @xmath82 @xcite and @xmath83 left as a free parameter show that there exists a correction to scaling with an exponent near @xmath84 , with an uncertainty margin of a few tenths .",
    "this exponent is consistent with @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 criterion provides strong indications that another correction to scaling is present , but the data are not accurate enough to allow a reliable determination of its exponent .",
    "further corrections may be expected with exponent @xmath87 ( irrelevant exponent @xmath88 in the kac table ) and with @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting values for the @xmath40 are still somewhat dependent on which correction exponent is included . taking into account the uncertainty due to this dependence , as well as the statistical error margin ,",
