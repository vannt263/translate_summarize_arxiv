    "video streaming has become the main impetus of the ongoing increasing wireless traffic . in practice ,",
    "excessive demands at busy times often lead to congestion in communication networks .",
    "one promising approach to mitigate the congestion is to duplicate some of contents that may be requested by users into memories distributed across the network in advance , for example , at offpeak times @xcite .    in their seminal work on coded caching ,",
    "maddah - ali and niesen proposed schemes that create multicasting opportunities by exploiting the caching @xcite .",
    "they modeled the content duplicating with a content placement phase , and the busy times with a content delivery phase . by jointly designing the two phases , the central server is able to deliver distinct contents to distinct users . compared to conventional uncoded caching schemes ,",
    "significant gains can be achieved by coding in the delivery phase .",
    "the scheme is essentially centralized because the central server coordinates all the transmissions .",
    "the work has been extended to other scenarios , for example , decentralized version @xcite , device to device networks @xcite , online caching update @xcite and hierarchical networks @xcite , @xcite etc .",
    "in most of the existing coded caching schemes , each file has to be split into @xmath0 packets , where @xmath0 usually increases exponentially with the number of users @xmath1",
    ". this would be unpractical when @xmath1 is large . to study caching schemes that require smaller order of @xmath0 , yan _",
    "reformulated the problem as a placement delivery array ( pda ) design problem .",
    "a pda clearly indicates what is cached by users and what is sent by the server in a single array .",
    "thus , designing a centralized coded caching scheme for a given system is transformed into a problem of designing a proper pda for given parameters .",
    "accordingly , a construction was presented in @xcite , which significantly decreases @xmath0 , while the load only suffers from a slight sacrifice , in contrast to that in @xcite .",
    "very recently , in view of pda , shangguan _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite extended the schemes in @xcite and @xcite to a larger family of pda .",
    "they showed that a pda exists if and only if a corresponding linear @xmath2-free @xmath3-uniform @xmath3-partite hypergraph exists .",
    "they illustrated that , for some parameters , schemes that @xmath0 grows sub - exponentially with @xmath1 exist .",
    "in this paper , we establish the connection pda with another topic in graph theory , i.e. , strong edge coloring of bipartite graph .",
    "we prove that a pda exists if and only if a corresponding strong edge colored bipartite graph exists .",
    "this allows us to construct new pdas from structured bipartite graphs .",
    "particularly , we construct a class of pda from bipartite graphs , which includes both the scheme in @xcite and its extended version in @xcite as special cases . as a result , it contributes a larger cluster of pda with more parameters .",
    "particularly , it also generates some pdas that are not covered by @xcite such that @xmath0 increases sub - exponentially with @xmath1 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec_prob ] , we depict the system model and background on pda . in section [ sec : graphpda ] , we introduce the strong edge coloring and its connection with pda",

    "this system operates in two separated phases :    1 .",
    "* placement phase : * a file is sub - divided into @xmath0 equal packets , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "each packet is of size @xmath13 .",
    "each user is accessible to the files set @xmath7 .",
    "each packet is placed in different user caches determinately .",

    "* delivery phase : * each user requests one file from @xmath7 independently .",
    "denote the request by @xmath16 , i.e. , user @xmath15 requests file @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "once the server receives the request @xmath19 , it broadcasts a signal of at most @xmath20 packets to users .",
    "each user is able to recover its requested file .",
    "we refer to such a caching scheme as a @xmath0-division caching scheme , since each file is sub - divided into @xmath0 packets .",
    "specially , the rate of the @xmath0-division caching scheme is defined as @xmath21 which should be as small as possible for a given @xmath11 caching system .",

    "an interesting result corresponding to pda is :    [ thm : bigraph ] for any @xmath26 array @xmath80 $ ] , composed of a special symbol @xmath29 and integers @xmath67 , @xmath68 is a pda if and only if in its corresponding colored bipartite graph @xmath81 ,    1 .",

    "the advantage is that , we can utilize any existing result on the strong chromatic index of bipartite graphs in the literature to find new constructions of pda , and furthermore to recover more coded caching schemes .",
    "we will discuss more about this in section [ sec : construction ] .",

    "fig : a42 ] .",

    "we assume @xmath127 , then table [ table1 ] lists the transmitting steps :",
    "the edge coloring is an active research area .",
    "unfortunately , for the strong chromatic index of bipartite graphs , there are rare results . for general case ,",
    "only some small parameters results exist , for example,@xcite and @xcite discuss the strong edge coloring of bipartite graph whose one part of verticals has only at most @xmath103 or @xmath3 degrees .",
    "however , some specific structures do exist . in this section",
    ", we construct a class of pdas from the existing structures in bipartite graph .",
    "define @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) where the verticals of @xmath130 are the @xmath131-subsets of @xmath132 ( i.e. , the subsets of cardinality @xmath131 ) , the verticals of @xmath133 are the @xmath134-subsets of @xmath132 .",

    "now , according to theorem [ thm : bigraph ] , it is easy to obtain the following conclusion :    [ thm : subset ] for any @xmath151 with @xmath152 , there exists a @xmath44-@xmath31 pda , where @xmath153 and @xmath154    the arrays are constructed from the @xmath148 with coloring strategies s@xmath84 and s@xmath103 .",

    "are and respectively .",
    "we choose the pda with smaller @xmath25 .",
    "finally , it is easy to see @xmath159 thus choose the pda with smaller @xmath25 is equivalent to choose the pda with larger coding gain .",
    "this results the coding gain @xmath44 .    by and , when @xmath160 , is smaller than , while when @xmath161 , is smaller than . for a general @xmath162",

    "this is the exactly the scheme 1 in @xcite .",
    "thus , theorem [ thm : subset ] includes both ali - niesen scheme and the extended version in @xcite as special cases .",
    "since we can hardly express @xmath166 and @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 , it seems hard to measure the performance of the scheme in theorem [ thm : subset ] . but",
    "theorem [ thm : subset ] may contributes a lot of schemes with flexible tradeoff between @xmath0 and @xmath166 .",
    "an example is as follows :    let @xmath167 , then theorem [ thm : subset ] results a scheme for a @xmath11 system where @xmath168 , @xmath169 . note that , this construction is not included in @xcite . for such system , we compare ali - niesen scheme with the new scheme in theorem [ thm : subset ] .",
    "it can be seen that , with an expense of a multiple of @xmath170 , ( less than @xmath134 ) in rate , @xmath0 can be decreased dramatically , from @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "note that , by stirling s formular , we can derive @xmath173    in summary , the new scheme decreases @xmath0 from approximately @xmath174 to @xmath175 .",
    "note that since @xmath176 , this indicates that in the new scheme , @xmath0 increases sub - exponentially with @xmath1 , but @xmath166 increases approximately the same as the square root of @xmath1 .",
    "table [ table6 ] lists some numerical results .",
    "in this paper , we bridge the placement delivery array in coded caching with the strong edge coloring of bipartite graph .",
    "it turns out that a pda is equivalent to a strong edge colored bipartite graph .",
    "this connection allows us to utilize the existing structures in the bipartite graph area to construct new pdas",
    ". then a class of pda is constructed according to the ( generalized ) subset graph @xcite .",
    "this results in a more general class of pda compared to the extended version of ali - niesen scheme in @xcite .",
