    "in iii - v - based diluted magnetic semiconductors such as ( ga , mn)as , the ferromagnetic interaction between the localized mn spins is mediated by mobile holes.@xcite spin polarization and spin - orbit coupling of the carriers result in a large anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) , which has been discussed intensively and controversially since the 1950s.@xcite the total hall resistivity of ferromagnets originates from the sum of the normal hall effect and the ahe@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ordinary and the anomalous hall coefficients , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the magnetic induction and @xmath9 the magnetization perpendicular to the layer . until a few years ago",
    ", the ahe was exclusively ascribed to scattering anisotropies induced by spin - orbit interaction,@xcite known as the extrinsic skew scattering@xcite and side jump@xcite mechanisms .",
    "these mechanisms lead to contributions to @xmath10 showing a linear and quadratic dependence on the longitudinal resistivity @xmath11 , respectively . accordingly , eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are constants for magnetic fields high enough to saturate @xmath9 or , to be more precise , to saturate the hole spin polarization .",
    "an anomalous hall term , quadratic in @xmath11 , is also obtained for the intrinsic ( scattering independent ) mechanism related to the berry phase.@xcite it was first associated with the ahe in ( ga , mn)as by jungwirth et al . in their seminal paper ref .  , where they supposed the anomalous hall conductivity in metallic ( ga , mn)as to originate from strongly spin orbit - coupled holes acquiring a berry phase during their motion on the spin - split fermi surfaces .",
    "meanwhile the berry phase mechanism is considered the dominant contribution to the ahe in metallic ( ga , mn)as.@xcite whereas most papers concerning the ahe in ( ga , mn)as are primarily focused on the metallic regime@xcite , only a few systematic studies concentrate on the low - conductivity regime.@xcite allen et al.@xcite examined the ahe in digitally doped ( ga , mn)as structures with hopping transport on the insulating side of the metal insulator transition ( mit ) . recently , shen et al.@xcite focused on the low - conductivity regime of ( ga , mn)as with @xmath11 between 0.01 and 2@xmath15 cm .",
    "they experimentally ascertained a scaling relation @xmath16 with a scaling exponent of @xmath17 .",
    "the same value for @xmath18 was obtained in ref .   for a high - resistivity ( ga , mn)as sample showing large magnetoresistance . neither in ref .   nor in ref .",
    "a theoretical explanation for this value was presented . in ref .  , the authors analyzed a series of ( ga , mn)as samples and observed a crossover of the anomalous hall coefficient @xmath19 from the low - resistivity regime dominated by the berry phase with @xmath20 to the high - resistivity region with @xmath21 .",
    "+ in this work , we experimentally find a scaling exponent of @xmath22 in the low - conductivity regime , which is consistent with a unified theory of the ahe , based on the keldysh formalism , recently developed for multiband ferromagnetic metals by onoda et al.@xcite this model predicts three regimes depending on the carrier scattering time : in the  clean  limit ( extremely high - conductivity samples ) , the extrinsic skew scattering mechanism with @xmath23 dominates .",
    "this regime is beyond the conductivities achievable in the current ( ga , mn)as growth technology . in the intermediate regime ( high - conductivity samples ) , the intrinsic berry phase mechanism with @xmath24 prevails , and in the  dirty  limit ( low - conductivity samples ) the intrinsic contribution is strongly damped , resulting in a scaling relation @xmath25 .",
    "as shown below , the conductivities in the ( ga , mn)as samples under study correspond to the intermediate and dirty regime .",
    "therefore , according to the model of onoda et al . , eq .",
    "has to be replaced by @xmath26 whereas in nonmagnetic p - type semiconductors the hole density @xmath27 can be easily derived from the ordinary hall coefficient @xmath28 , obtained by magnetotransport measurements at low magnetic fields , the determination of @xmath27 in ( ga , mn)as is complicated by the dominant anomalous contribution @xmath10 in eq .  .",
    "to overcome this problem , @xmath29 and @xmath11 are usually recorded as a function of @xmath8 above the saturation field and @xmath6 is derived by fitting eq .   to the experimental values of @xmath29 . in general , its value is significantly affected by the choice of the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in refs .   and , the ahe is described in terms of the anomalous hall conductivity @xmath30 and longitudinal conductivity @xmath0 instead of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . since in ( ga ,",
    "mn)as @xmath31 has been experimentally established , the conductivities and resistivities are related by @xmath32",
    "in order to investigate the scaling relation between @xmath30 and @xmath0 in ( ga , mn)as , we have studied the ahe in a set of twenty samples with longitudinal conductivities covering about one order of magnitude from 39@xmath33@xmath3 to 442@xmath33@xmath3 .",
    "the samples with thicknesses from 30 to 250 nm and mn concentrations between 2% and 5% were grown by low - temperature molecular - beam epitaxy .",
    "samples of different quality were obtained by variation of the substrate temperature and/or the v / iii flux ratio , as well as by using undoped semi - insulating ( 001)- and ( 113)a gaas wafers or partially relaxed ( 001 ) ( ga , in)as / gaas templates .",
    "all layers showed the typical ( ga , mn)as reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) pattern during the growth with no visible second phase of hexagonal mnas clusters .",
    "further experimental details concerning the sample growth can be found in refs .  .",
    "the samples with high conductivities @xmath34180@xmath33@xmath3 were obtained by postgrowth annealing for 1h at 250@xmath35c in air . throughout this paper ,",
    "samples with @xmath36@xmath3 at 4.2k are referred to as metallic .",
    "1000@xmath37m@xmath38300@xmath37 m hall bar structures were prepared from the samples by standard photolithography and wet chemical etching .",
    "the transverse and longitudinal resistances were measured by magnetotransport at 4.2k applying magnetic fields up to 14.5 t .",

    "[ b523_113_hall](b ) and [ b464_2_hall](b ) shows that the mr for @xmath50 t in the metallic sample b is about two orders of magnitude smaller than in sample a , resulting in an extremely weak dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , the ahe makes only a marginal contribution to the slope of @xmath29 and , as a consequence , eqs .   and yield the same fit curves as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",

    "[ introduction ] , the data presented by shen et al.@xcite for low - conductivity ( ga , mn)as follows a very similar scaling relation @xmath60 ( dashed - dotted line ) , which they claim to be incompatible with existing scattering theories . if the mr of a sample is large , the scaling relation in eq .",

    "the scaling exponent @xmath18 turned out to be close to 0.4 .",
    "due to the fact that the scaling exponent @xmath66 , or equivalently @xmath22 , has also been found in numerous other low - conductivity ferromagnets , independent of the details of the underlying transport process ( see e.g. refs .  , and references therein , and refs .  ) , we are led to the conclusion that it has to be considered universal and applies to low - conductivity ( ga , mn)as irrespective of the specific material parameters . for samples with longitudinal conductivities between @xmath45100 and @xmath45200@xmath67@xmath3 , @xmath59 gradually decreases to @xmath68 with increasing @xmath0 in qualitative agreement with the theory presented in refs .   and .",
    "for the high - conductivity samples with @xmath69@xmath67@xmath3 , @xmath70 becomes independent of @xmath0 amounting to @xmath71@xmath3 .",
    "this value is in quantitative agreement with theoretical data in ref .",
    "calculated within the framework of the berry phase theory of the ahe for a disordered sample with @xmath72@xmath48 . since",
    "the mean value of @xmath27 derived for the metallic samples under study is also close to @xmath73@xmath48 ( see below ) , our result for the high - conductivity regime corroborates the intrinsic origin of the ahe in metallic ( ga , mn)as . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ sxy_ahe_sxx ] , a significant linear contribution @xmath74 due to skew scattering can be ruled out for the investigated range of @xmath0 .",

    "in fact , the adequate description of the hole transport in metallic ( ga , mn)as at 4.2k , neclecting small quantum corrections , is given by the generalized einstein relation@xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 denotes the hole diffusion constant and @xmath86 the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the experimentally observed linear increase of @xmath0 with increasing @xmath27 in the metallic regime indicates a proportionality @xmath77 .",
