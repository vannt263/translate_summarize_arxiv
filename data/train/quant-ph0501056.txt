    "another important motivation is the relationship between the hsp over the dihedral group with hidden shift problems  @xcite and cryptographically important cases of the shortest lattice vector problem  @xcite .",
    "so far , algorithms for the hsp are only known for a few families of nonabelian groups , including wreath products @xmath28  @xcite ; more generally , semidirect products @xmath29 where @xmath30 is of polynomial size , and groups whose commutator subgroup is of polynomial size  @xcite ; `` smoothly solvable '' groups  @xcite ; and some semidirect products of cyclic groups  @xcite .",

    "indeed , careful basis selection appears to be critical for obtaining efficient fourier transforms for the groups mentioned above .",
    "perhaps the most fundamental question concerning the hidden subgroup problem is whether there is always a basis for the representations of @xmath0 such that measuring in this basis ( in step 4 , above ) provides enough information to determine the subgroup @xmath3 .",

    "strong fourier sampling_. in this article , we answer this question in the negative , showing that natural subgroups of @xmath27 can not be determined by this process ; in fact , we show this for an even more general model , where we perform an arbitrary positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) on coset states @xmath47 .",

    "weak fourier sampling is basis - independent , making it attractive from the standpoint of analysis ; however , it can not distinguish conjugate subgroups from each other , and hallgren , russell and ta - shma  @xcite showed that it can not distinguish the trivial subgroup from an order-2 subgroup consisting of @xmath48 disjoint transpositions .",
    "specifically , they used character bounds to show that the probability distribution obtained on representation names for the trivial and order-2 subgroups are exponentially close in total variation distance : it requires an exponential number of such experiments to distinguish them .",

    "this can be explained , roughly , by the fact that projecting a vector into a sufficiently high - dimensional random subspace results in tightly concentrated length .",
    "on the other hand , moore , rockmore , russell and schulman  @xcite showed that for the affine and @xmath49-hedral groups , measuring in a well - chosen basis can solve the hsp ( at least information - theoretically ) in cases where random bases can not .",

    "furthermore , an easy computation shows that @xmath440 and hence that @xmath441 is irreducible if @xmath442 , while if @xmath443 then the induced representation is the direct sum of two irreducible representations , @xmath444 where @xmath445 and @xmath253 are the trivial and sign representations , respectively , of @xmath446 .",
    "each of these irreducible representations acts on @xmath447 , the vector space supporting the action of @xmath448 .",
    "both of them realize the element @xmath449 as the linear map @xmath450 , while @xmath451 and @xmath452 realize the element @xmath453 as the maps which send @xmath454 to @xmath455 and @xmath456 respectively .",
    "the characters of these representations can be determined by inspection ; in particular , @xmath457 where @xmath458 and @xmath459 denote the characters of @xmath451 and @xmath452 respectively .    in light of this description of the irreducible characters of @xmath30 , one finds that @xmath460 when @xmath461 and that @xmath462 for @xmath463 . in particular , the absolute value of the normalized character at @xmath464 is @xmath465 .",
