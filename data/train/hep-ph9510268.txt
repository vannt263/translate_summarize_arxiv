    "table i summarizes the parameter sets that we will examine and the parameter dependence of @xmath22 spectra are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    what we want to have is more deeply bound states with wider level splittings , which can be achieved if we have a deeper and narrower interacting potentials in the equations of motion for the heavy mesons .",
    "one way of obtaining such potentials in a given model lagrangian is to take the empirical value for @xmath31 instead of @xmath61 mev . since the soliton wave function @xmath34 is only a function of a dimensionless variable @xmath184 ( in the chiral limit ) , the functions @xmath185 and @xmath186 appearing in potentials scale with the factor @xmath187 .",

    "we fix the nucleon mass to 940 mev for all parameter sets . compared with @xmath31=64.5 mev and @xmath32=5.45",
    ", @xmath187 becomes 1.3 times larger and thus the potential becomes deeper and narrower by the same factor .",
    "this is shown by the dashed line of fig .",
    "3 . the change in @xmath31 alone ( set 2 ) helps the ground @xmath22 mass to come down to 2339 mev with the @xmath197-@xmath22 mass difference being 270 mev .",
    "another way of improving the results is simply to take a larger @xmath198 value ( with putting aside the experimental upper limit on @xmath198 for a while ) , which makes the potential deeper . the dotted line in fig .",
    "3 is what obtained by varying @xmath59 and @xmath199 to @xmath200 while keeping @xmath31=64.5 mev ( set 3 ) .",
    "surprisingly , this nearly 20% change in coupling constants results in about 50% enhancement in the binding energy , while the mass splitting is not so much improved compared with that of set 1 . by the same way",
    ", we take the empirical value for @xmath31 and vary @xmath59 so that the ground @xmath22 mass becomes close to the experimental value , which is achieved with @xmath201 ( set 4 ) .",
    "this parameter set yields comparable @xmath22 mass spectrum to the experiments , which looks quite encouraging .",
    "furthermore , if we break the heavy quark spin symmetric relation , @xmath202 , between the two coupling constants , we can obtain more realistic mass splitting between @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "as an example , we choose @xmath205 and @xmath206 with @xmath196 mev ( set 5 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these coupling constants are not close to the recent estimates of @xmath207 @xcite .",
    "we regard this fact as an indication of the important role of higher order corrections such as light vector mesons .    in fig .",

    "especially , one can notice that it becomes much more improved compared with the first trial , sm @xcite , in the skyrme model .",
    "one may improve the result by adjusting all the parameters for the best fit .",
    "what we have done in this work is just to vary two coupling constants around the values given by the nonrelativistic quark model prediction and the heavy quark symmetric relation , _ i.e. _ , @xmath208 . as for the other parameters",

    "note that the same is true for the quark models except qm2 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that one can not improve this situation simply by making the hyperfine constant @xmath0 larger in any way . by eliminating @xmath168 and @xmath120 in the mass formula ( [ massform ] )",
    ", we obtain a model - independent relation @xmath211 ( the same model - independent mass relation holds in the nonrelativistic quark model of de rjula , georgi , and glashow @xcite . ) thus , when our model successfully reproduces all the experimental values for @xmath174 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 , we get @xmath215 as our best prediction .",
    "it is only the half of the value evaluated with the recent @xmath216 @xcite .",
    "we present the @xmath24 mass spectrum obtained with this parameter set in fig . 6 with the other model calculations .",
    "the parameter set used for the charm baryons does not work well in the bottom sector ; set 5 yields the ground @xmath24 mass as 5492 mev which is @xmath217 mev below the experimental value .",
    "we may repeat the same process of varying the @xmath59 ( with keeping the empirical value 93 mev for @xmath31 ) to fit the @xmath24 mass of 5641 mev .",
    "we also expect that the heavy quark symmetry relation ( [ hqr ] ) holds well in the bottom sector .",
    "this process leads us to @xmath218 ( set 6 ) . the results with this parameter set",
    "are also given in fig .",
    "the mass splitting ( @xmath219 mev ) between the excited @xmath220 and the ground state @xmath24 appears much smaller than that of the @xmath22 given in fig .",
    "4 , while the quark model calculations show nearly independent mass splittings whether the heavy constituent is a @xmath0-quark ( @xmath221 mev ) or a @xmath222-quark ( @xmath223@xmath224 mev ) . together with the differences in coupling constants fitting the charm baryons and the bottom baryons ,",
    "this apparent difference in the mass splitting is certainly at odds with the _ heavy quark flavor symmetry .",
    "_ such a heavy quark flavor symmetry is expected to be somehow broken because of the mass difference between the @xmath0-quark and @xmath222-quark .",
    "however , since both are much heavier than the typical scale of the strong interaction ( @xmath225 mev ) , the actual amount of the symmetry breaking in nature that occurs at the order of @xmath226 would not be so large .",
    "such a behavior can be seen also in the @xmath25 spectrum given in fig .",
    "since there is no experimental data for the @xmath25 baryons , we can only compare our results with the quark model predictions .",
    "one can find that the mass splitting between the ground @xmath24 and the @xmath227 is 180 @xmath63 190 mev , which is comparable to the quark model predictions .",
    "also the small mass splitting ( @xmath63 10 mev ) between @xmath227 and @xmath228 is still consistent with the quark model predictions .",
    "however , as in the @xmath24 spectrum , the excitation energy ( @xmath63 170 mev ) of @xmath229 appears again smaller than the quark model values ( @xmath63 280 mev ) .",
    "it may be the ignorance of the soliton - recoil effect in our work that causes the larger break down of the heavy quark flavor symmetry than what is actually implied in the model . in order to see this ,",
    "let us go back to fig .",
    "we can see that the kinetic effect reduces the binding energy of the lowest @xmath43 @xmath230 meson bound state by 410 ( 240 ) mev from its infinitely heavy mass limit @xmath231 mev @xcite .",
    "note that the ratio of the kinetic effects ( @xmath232 ) and the ratio of energy splittings between the first excited state and the ground state @xmath233 are very close to the square root of the ( inverse ) mass ratio ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "one can easily understand this feature in the harmonic oscillator approximation .",
    "thus , in our working frame , the fact that @xmath235 mesons are 2.6 times heavier than @xmath43 mesons becomes directly reflected in the results . a simple way of estimating the soliton - recoil effect is to use the  reduced mass \" of the soliton  heavy - meson system , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . with the soliton mass about 1 gev ,",
    "the reduced masses of the @xmath43 mesons and @xmath235 mesons become @xmath236 gev and @xmath237 gev , respectively .",
    "then , the use of these small reduced masses can widen the energy splittings and their small ratio @xmath238 will not break the heavy quark flavor symmetry so seriously .",
    "( see also fig .",
    "@xcite . ) on the other hand , it will require stronger potentials to overcome the larger kinetic energies , which should be supplied by including the light vector mesons and/or higher derivative terms into the lagrangian @xcite .    in summary",

    "the nearly degenerate doublets in the spectrum are consistent with the heavy quark _ spin _",
