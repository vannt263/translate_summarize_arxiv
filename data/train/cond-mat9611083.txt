    "there is mounting evidence that the normal state of underdoped high-@xmath0 superconductors ( htsc ) is dominated by a pseudogap .",
    "a number of physical probes show that below a characteristic temperature @xmath2 , which can be well above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 , the physical response of htsc materials can be interpreted in terms of the formation of a partial gap or a pseudogap by which we mean a suppression of the density of low - energy excitations .",
    "this gap persists in the superconducting state .",
    "@xmath2 decreases with increasing doping in the underdoped regime and since @xmath0 rises with doping , the two curves meet at the optimal doping level , as shown in the schematic phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ phase - dia1 ] .",
    "the earliest experiments to reveal gap - like behavior in the normal state were nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements of the knight shift,@xcite which probes the uniform spin susceptibility . in conventional superconductors and the cuprates at optimal doping ,",
    "the knight shift is temperature independent in the normal state but drops rapidly below @xmath0 due to pairing of electronic spins into ( singlet ) superconducting cooper pairs . in underdoped cuprates",
    ", however , the knight shift begins to drop well above the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "_ concluded that in these materials spin pairing takes place well above the bulk superconducting transition at @xmath0 , thus producing a normal - state energy gap , referred to as a `` spin gap''.@xcite    = 0.5    deviations from the well known linear temperature dependence of the @xmath1-plane resistivity,@xcite @xmath4 , were observed in underdoped cuprates as well,@xcite with the slope of @xmath4 changing below a characteristic temperature @xmath2 .",
    "as the doping is increased towards the optimal level , @xmath2 decreases and the near - optimal doping @xmath4 is linear over the range of temperatures from @xmath0 to above 800  k.@xcite    the magnitude of @xmath2 as well as its variation with doping suggest that the suppression of the spin susceptibility observed in nmr measurements and the change of slope of @xmath4 have a common physical origin .",
    "it has been suggested that if the scattering responsible for the linear temperature dependence of @xmath5 involves scattering on spin fluctuations , then the spin gap seen in nmr below @xmath2 would naturally account for the depression of @xmath4 below @xmath2 as well .",
    "similar evidence for the suppression of the spin susceptibility has been extracted from neutron scattering experimental results.@xcite specific heat measurements on underdoped yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( y123 ) , however , show that there is a large decrease in entropy below a temperature , closely related to the @xmath2 , which can not be accounted for by assuming that a gap in the spin degrees of freedom is solely responsible.@xcite    there is spectroscopic evidence of anomalies in the properties of htsc that were originally associated with the formation of the superconducting gap , but were found to occur at @xmath9 in underdoped samples .",
    "the shift in the position and width of raman frequencies of certain phonons , associated with the onset of superconductivity,@xcite were shown to occur in the normal state of underdoped cuprates and it was suggested they were related to the spin gap.@xcite similarly , broad peaks in the electronic raman continuum , also interpreted as an evidence for the formation of a superconducting gap,@xcite were found to occur well above @xmath0 in underdoped samples.@xcite    indications of normal - state , gap - like anomalies in underdoped cuprates were observed in infrared optical measurements as well . to a first approximation the @xmath1-plane optical properties of htsc are those of a metal where the charge carriers move coherently through the lattice .",
    "such coherent motion gives rise to a conductivity peak , centered at zero frequency , called the drude peak , whose width is a measure of the inverse lifetime of the carriers . in this paper",
    "we call systems that have a conductivity peak at zero frequency coherent systems .",
    "in contrast , transport in the c - axis direction does not show a peak a zero frequency and we call this incoherent transport . on closer examination the reflectance of most high temperature superconductors",
    "was found to deviate from simple drude behavior which predicts a reflectance decreasing monotonically with frequency .",
    "a structure in the form of a `` knee '' was found at approximately 500  @xmath10 .",
    "this structure was sometimes interpreted as a manifestation of a conventional superconducting gap .",
    "it has been found , however , that in underdoped materials the knee starts to develop already in the normal state .",
    "@xcite a comparison with other probes suggests that the knee structure and deviations observed in the dc transport and nmr experiments all occur at a characteristic temperature remarkably similar to @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding changes in the complex optical conductivity @xmath11 involve a shift of part of the @xmath12 spectral weight from 300- 700  @xmath10 to _ lower _ frequencies , resulting in a marked narrowing of the drude peak .",
    "this behavior is in accord with decreasing dc resistivity and was interpreted in terms of coupling of electrons to the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons@xcite or as a manifestation of the spin gap.@xcite    it should be emphasized that in the case of a _ coherent _ system , such as the underdoped cuprates in @xmath1-plane direction , there is no direct mapping between the electronic density of states ( dos ) and the shape of the real part of conductivity , @xmath12 .",
    "for example , even if there is a gap in electronic dos and its magnitude is larger than the characteristic energy associated with the _ elastic _ scattering ( clean limit@xcite ) , the gap will not manifest itself in the @xmath12 spectra . in the same way , a pseudogap in the electronic dos of a coherent system , that may appear due to strong interactions in the system , does not appear as an obvious gap in the conductivity .",

    "is increased to near- and above optimal the normal - state gap - like feature disappears .    in the following , we summarize the recent experimental optical results obtained from several series of htsc materials at doping levels ranging from underdoped to strongly overdoped .",
    "we find that in the pseudogap state the optical response of underdoped cuprates is marked by an increase in coherence of the electronic system . since the coherence effects are seen more clearly through the frequency dependent charge - carrier scattering or memory function analysis , we have chosen to use this approach .",
    "the essential features of this very general formalism are described in section iii .",
    "we will also restrict our survey to the ab - plane optical properties .",
    "the c - axis optical data are less complete since the large , thick crystals needed for this work are not available for all systems .",
    "we will , however , try to address the question of the correlation between the @xmath1-plane and the @xmath3-axis pseudogap properties as we change materials , doping and temperature .",
    "in order to cover a broad range of doping regimes we performed reflectivity measurements upon three families of high-@xmath0 cuprates : ybco ( including y123 and y124 ) , bi2212 and tl@xmath6sr@xmath6cuo@xmath20 ( tl2201 ) .",
    "this was necessary because , with the exception of la214 , none of the existing cuprates allows one to explore a full spectrum of doping regimes .",
    "for instance , y123 materials can be conveniently underdoped by reducing the amount of oxygen from the optimally doped level at @xmath21 .",
    "however these crystals are not suitable for strong overdoping . on the contrary",
    ", tl2201 samples could be only overdoped by introducing interstitial o atoms between the tlo planes so that @xmath0 is suppressed from about 90 k in the _ stoichiometric _ composition down to less than 4 k in the overdoped composition .",
    "single crystals of bi2212 can be both overdoped and underdoped , but the suppression of the critical temperature is very limited on the overdoped side .",
    "we have also used bi2212 crystals with 20% of bi substituted by pb which allows one to achieve a higher degree of overdoping .",
    "the influence of disorder on the infrared response of ybco crystals was studied by substituting cu atoms in the cuo@xmath6 planes with zn.@xcite    the response of ybco crystals was studied in three carrier density regimes : in an optimally doped y123 crystal with oxygen content set at x=6.95 ( @xmath0=93.5  k ) , in the _ same _ crystal deoxygenated down to x=6.6 ( @xmath0=59  k)@xcite and in a double - chained y124 crystal with @xmath0=82  k.@xcite the carrier density in the stoichiometric and naturally untwinned y124 corresponds to that of y123 samples with @xmath22 .",
    "the y123 crystal was mechanically detwinned so that both @xmath23- and @xmath24-axis components of the conductivity tensor were obtained independently , allowing us to probe the response of the cuo@xmath6 planes _ only _ without any contribution from the charge reservoir structural blocks .",

    "we found that in the frequency region that we will be of interest in this work ( @xmath29  @xmath10 ) the particular choice of the low - frequency approximation is not important . at high frequencies ,",

    "@xmath45 is a green function of electronic excitation and @xmath46 is the self - energy part .",
    "the narrowness of the peak means that the excitation energy must be much larger than the damping term @xmath47 .",
    "this is certainly true in case of standard fermi - liquid theory , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 so that the electronic excitations ( quasiparticles ) are well - defined at zero temperature and energies close to the fermi energy @xmath50.@xcite it can also be shown@xcite that a weak electron - phonon coupling , although it violates the quasiparticle description at energies very close to @xmath50 , does not drastically change the transport properties at low temperatures , since in this case the number of electronic states where the quasiparticle description is violated is small .",
    "therefore , the drude formula is applicable only for simple metals at low frequencies and low temperatures where elastic scattering from impurities and weak quasielastic scattering from thermally excited excitations such as phonons dominate.@xcite    on the other hand , following the original ideas of anderson,@xcite it is now widely accepted that the electronic system of htsc materials represent a new kind of quantum liquid and the simple fermi - liquid quasiparticle description is not applicable to the normal - state properties of these materials .",
    "for example , the key ingredient of the phenomenological `` marginal '' fermi - liquid theory,@xcite advanced to explain these properties , is the assumption that the @xmath51 and , consequently , @xmath52 diverges logarithmically at the fermi energy , thus making @xmath53 entirely incoherent at @xmath50 .",
    "on a more microscopic level , a similar result is expected for the quasi - one dimensional hubbard model , which was identified by anderson as an appropriate paradigm for the resonant valence bond ( rvb ) description.@xcite even in more fermi - liquid - like scenarios , sufficiently strong coupling of an electronic system to a bosonic energy spectrum may result in a violation of the quasiparticle description.@xcite in addition , the fermi energy is estimated to be only @xmath54  ev , which is not much larger than the energies probed in infrared experiments ( 4 - 300  mev ) .",
    "such a low @xmath50 may be another reason for violation of a quasiparticle description . since this implies the absence of well - defined elementary excitations , the approximations used to obtain eq .",
    "1 are not justified .",
    "the breakdown of the quasiparticle description has also been discussed by emery and kivelson in the context of abnormally short values of the mean free path that lead to the violation of the ioffe - regel criterion.@xcite    however , the optical conductivity can be described in a much more general way by making the damping term in the drude formula complex and frequency - dependent : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is called a memory function.@xcite the @xmath56 satisfies @xmath57 and @xmath58 . the consequences of this formalism , usually referred to as the extended drude model , have been derived for the infrared conductivity of metals with a strong electron - phonon interaction by allen@xcite and allen and mikkelsen@xcite for the case of zero temperature .",
    "the analysis was later extended for the case of finite temperatures by shulga _",
    "et al._@xcite it is also believed that the resulting theory is valid in the case of coupling of a fermi liquid to any bosonic energy spectrum .",
    "some aspects of the extended drude model were also examined in detail by gtze and wlfe.@xcite we are not aware of any quantitative predictions regarding the extended drude model in the completely non - fermi - liquid scenario , such as the luttinger - liquid theory .",
    "therefore , in the following we will employ the fermi - liquid terminology .",
    "the formalism has been previously applied to transition - metal compounds,@xcite heavy - fermion materials,@xcite and the htsc cuprates.@xcite    rewriting the complex conductivity @xmath40 in terms of a complex memory function , @xmath59 , one obtains@xcite :    @xmath60}}\\ ] ]    although , in the case of a metal , eq .  3 can be obtained using boltzmann - equation formalism with a frequency dependent scattering rate,@xcite this form has in fact a range of validity more general than the boltzmann - equation approach.@xcite adopting the boltzmann - type terminology , the quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 describe the frequency - dependent scattering rate and mass enhancement of electronic excitations due to many - body interactions .    using the more general form of eq .  3 , one can check the range of validity of the classical drude formula of eq .  1 by expanding the memory function into taylor series for small frequencies :    @xmath63    substituting this into eq .",
    "3 one finds :    @xmath64    recovering eq .  1 .",
    "the classical drude result is thus valid whenever expansion of eq .",
    "4 makes sense and @xmath65 is small compared to unity .",
    "3 can be reduced to the familiar drude form of eq .  1 by introducing the so called renormalized scattering rate @xmath66 $ ] and the effective plasma frequency @xmath67 :    @xmath68    as it can be seen from this equation , the optical conductivity is now composed of an infinite set of drude peaks , each describing @xmath40 in the vicinity of a particular frequency @xmath69 with a set of parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( for simplicity in the following we will drop the temperature parameter when it is not relevant to a discussion ) . the @xmath70 has a phenomenological meaning of a width of the drude peak local to a frequency @xmath69 while @xmath71 represents the interaction - induced velocity renormalization .",
    "the renormalized scattering rate @xmath70 is not causal and , other than the local drude width , does not have a real physical sense as it includes both the velocity renormalization and the lifetime effects .    on the other hand , @xmath72 is , up to a constant , the real part of @xmath73    @xmath74    that is , a real part of a physical response function . in the limit of zero frequency",
    "the normal - state optical conductivity is completely real and eq .",
    "4 becomes @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the dc resistivity .",
    "this is the same form as the relaxation - time expression for the dc resistivity of a free electron gas and therefore @xmath77 may be viewed as an electronic lifetime .",

    "the particular choice should be made judging from the situation at hand .",
    "for example , the memory function analysis may be useful if one is interested in the relaxation processes that determine a system response to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "also , in certain cases the memory function is easier to calculate analytically , thus making it easier to analyze the physics behind the system behavior using experimental results for @xmath56 .",
    "for example , simple analytical formulae for @xmath56 have been derived for electron - phonon scattering while the optical conductivity has to be calculated numerically.@xcite    finally , we would like to stress that , although eq .",
    "3 is very general , obviously the _ interpretation _ of experimental results for @xmath87 in terms of scattering rate and mass enhancement only makes sense when a ( generalized ) boltzmann equation can be used .",
    "for example , if the optical response is determined by two distinct charge carrier systems ( two - component ) , so that the optical conductivity takes form :    @xmath89    the interpretation of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as a scattering rate and a mass enhancement is meaningless , as can be seen from eq.s  7,8 .",
    "this is the case if an interband transition is present in the same frequency region where there is an intraband response .",
    "we note however , that the form ( 12 ) can arise from a double - relaxation process ( two different scattering mechanisms ) as well.@xcite    since in the superconducting state @xmath12 is suppressed , the low - frequency optical conductivity is dominated by the imaginary term @xmath92 . in this case",
    "the low - frequency mass enhancement factor gives a ratio of the total plasma frequency , @xmath79 , to the plasma frequency of the superconducting carriers , @xmath93 , : @xmath94 .",

    "we note in this respect that the frequency scale in the spectra of @xmath72 associated with the pseudogap state , which does not significantly change with doping , remarkably coincidences with the high - frequency cut - off energy of the phonon density of states in htsc.@xcite    more generally , a serious defect of all models that employ scattering of electrons by bosonic excitations to describe the optical response of underdoped htsc is their failure to account for the observed behavior in the high - frequency part of @xmath72 spectra .",
    "as discussed in section  iv , underdoped cuprates do not show any temperature dependence in @xmath72 at @xmath179 @xmath10 . on the other hand , in section",
    "iii we saw that scattering of electrons by any temperature - independent bosonic spectrum leads to a strong temperature dependence of @xmath72 at high frequencies .",
    "the only way to get around this contradiction is to assume that the boson spectral function @xmath114 is also a function of _ temperature _ : @xmath180 . in this case , if the absolute value of @xmath180 scales properly with temperature , it may account for the observed temperature - independent scattering rate at high frequencies .",
    "the phonon density of states does not show any such changes.@xcite    one of the mechanisms that may yield a temperature - dependent @xmath181 function is the scattering of charge carriers on local fluctuations towards an antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the energy scale associated with spin fluctuations is measured@xcite to be of the order of 50  mev .",
    "the features in the scattering rate spectra that we observe in the pseudogap state are on the same energy scale , supporting such models .",
    "this mechanism would also provide a qualitative explanation for the doping dependence of the pseudogap .    finally , we can roughly estimate the boson spectral function that is needed to obtain the threshold structure in @xmath72 in the pseudogap state at @xmath148 .",
    "this estimate can be obtained by inverting the lowest temperature normal - state experimental results for @xmath72 using allen s expression ( eq .",
    "the complete inversion formula can be written as @xmath182 $ ] .",
    "@xcite since the process of numerical differentiating greatly amplifies the noise level of our spectra , we have chosen the following approach to minimize the added noise : the experimentally obtained @xmath72 for underdoped bi2212 was fitted with four straight lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] and then the inversion formula was applied to the resulting artificial spectrum composed of the straight pieces . in this scheme ,",
    "the exact inversion formula reduces to the first derivative , that is the slope of the straight lines .",
    "the resulting @xmath114 spectrum is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ alpha ] . obviously the rather crude approximation of the experimental curve prevents us from observing any fine details of the spectrum .",
    "the significant result is , however , that an intense peak in @xmath114 at 500 - 700  @xmath10 , superimposed on a broad background , is needed to account for the behavior of the scattering rate in the pseudogap state if one adopts an electron - boson scattering model .    = 0.6    we note that at least some of the current electron - electron scattering models suffer the same problems as the electron - boson ones .",
    "namely , they can not account for the weak or completely absent temperature dependence of @xmath72 spectra in underdoped cuprates at high frequencies .",
    "in the conventional fermi liquid theory , for example , electron - electron scattering rate is proportional to @xmath183 , that is the frequency and temperature dependence of the scattering rate `` mirror '' one another.@xcite another example of this type of mirroring is provided by the heavy fermion compound uru@xmath6si@xmath6@xcite or the perovskite sr@xmath6ruo@xmath13.@xcite in both cases a scaling of @xmath184 collapses the dc resistivity curve on the frequency dependent scattering rate curve .",
    "this is in contrast to the experimental observations of underdoped cuprates where a significant frequency dependence , but no temperature dependence , were observed at frequencies above 1000  @xmath10 .",
    "other fermi - liquid type models , such as the nested fermi - liquid ( nfl ) model or the marginal fermi - liquid ( mfl ) model , also predict a significant temperature dependence at high frequencies.@xcite for example , the main assumption of the phenomenological mfl model is that the scattering rate varies as @xmath185 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are constants of the order of unity .",
    "it is clear that in the underdoped materials @xmath32 does not follow this behavior since @xmath186 , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no temperature dependence associated with the linear in frequency scattering rate .",
    "as we have seen , a temperature dependence of the scattering rate does develop , but only in optimally doped and overdoped materials .",
    "we note that from a completely different point of view , the two component model of optical conductivity@xcite where the infrared conductivity is divided into a free - carrier and a midinfrared component , these observations imply that the mid infrared component is temperature independent in underdoped materials .",
    "some hints regarding the microscopic origin of the scattering mechanism in htsc can be obtained from the analysis of impurity effects . as was shown in section iv ,",
    "the effect of zn doping was not just the introduction of an additional frequency independent term in @xmath72 spectra .",
    "zinc substitution also modifies the frequency dependence of the scattering rate suggesting that _ inelastic _ processes are affected by zn as well .",
    "the @xmath3-axis results obtained for the sample with 0.425  @xmath162 zn reveal a _ complete suppression _ of the pseudogap.@xcite the effect of zn on the @xmath3-axis pseudogap is similar to the one observed in the spin - lattice relaxation time 1/@xmath187.@xcite the similar concentrations of zn in ceramic pellets of y124 completely suppress the pseudogap feature in the temperature dependence of @xmath188 , despite the fact that behavior of the knight shift remains unchanged from that of a pure sample .",
    "the results obtained from crystals with zn substitution strongly suggest that spin fluctuations may be involved or may even be the dominant mechanism of scattering in underdoped cuprates .",
    "there are several other theoretical models that attempt to explain the pseudogap phenomenon from different assumptions .",
    "the model due to emery and kivelson@xcite predicts that the low carrier density in the underdoped regime may result in pairing without pair - pair coherence at temperatures well above the actual @xmath0 , thus producing a pseudogap . as the temperature",
    "is lowered the phase coherence is established , leading to bulk superconductivity .",
    "this model would provide an explanation for the lack of dramatic changes upon crossing into the superconducting state , which is consistent with our optical experiments as well as arpes measurements .",
    "however , it is not quite clear why the high - frequency onset energy of the optical pseudogap does not change as a function of doping while @xmath2 and @xmath0 do .    in the spin - charge separation picture,@xcite spin singlets form at @xmath2 , giving rise to a spin gap",
    "while the charge carriers , holes which are bosons , bose condense at the superconducting transition.@xcite other models invoke a spin density wave@xcite in the context of a normal fermi liquid to form a gap in the spin excitations which are the predominant scatterers of the charge carriers .      as a small fraction of cu",
    "is substituted by zn , the optical response of underdoped y124 changes dramatically .",
    "contrary to what is seen in the underdoped samples in the pseudogap state or the optimally doped sample in the superconducting state , there is no structure in the scattering rate neither above nor below @xmath0 .",
    "these results suggest the temperature characterizing the pseudogap state @xmath2 can be very small and definitely much lower than @xmath0 .",
    "we note that a similar effect may be seen in overdoped cuprates .",
    "therefore we suggest that the addition of zn may have an effect similar to the overdoping of y124 compounds .",
    "the normal - state plasma frequency is not affected by zn substitution . indeed , as was demonstrated by puchkov _",
    "et al._,@xcite overdoping does not lead to any significant changes in the value of the in - plane plasma frequency . at the same time , overdoped compounds usually show a higher dc conductivity than their under- or optimally doped counterparts .",
    "that is not the case in the y124 material with zn where the conductivity @xmath189 is reduced .",
    "however this may simply reflect the fact that zn is put directly in the cuo@xmath6 planes and this inevitably causes additional impurity scattering .",
    "the latter effect is so strong that crystals with 1.25@xmath162 of zn show an evidence for a charge - carriers localization behavior in the optical conductivity .",
    "this point shall be addressed in detail elsewhere .",
    "it is critical to determine whether the effects observed in the y124 crystals with zn substitution are unique for this specific impurity or whether other types of disorder would produce similar results .",
    "a comparison of @xmath23-axis results for y123 materials with earlier @xmath3-axis data@xcite suggests that the pseudogap directly observed in the @xmath3-axis conductivity at @xmath148 is necessarily accompanied by a suppression of the in - plane @xmath72 at low frequencies .",
    "indeed , the threshold feature in @xmath190 is found in underdoped crystals at @xmath148 _ only _ when the spectrum of @xmath191 exhibits a pseudogap .",
    "the suppression of the pseudogap in @xmath191 , either by an increase of temperature above @xmath2 , or by an increase of the carrier density from x=6.6 to x=6.95 in y123 , or by the substitution of cu with zn in underdoped y124,@xcite restores the nearly - linear frequency dependence of the in - plane scattering rate .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the same microscopic mechanism leads to the opening of the pseudogap in the interplane response of ybco crystals _ and _ the low - frequency anomalies in the lifetime effects within the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the frequency shape of @xmath3-axis conductivity is somewhat similar to the bosonic spectral function , shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] , that is needed to reproduce the _ in - plane _ behavior of @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that there may be an intricate connection between the two .",
    "one of the most striking features of the curves , in our view , is how closely the @xmath32 curves for the underdoped cuprates in the superconducting state resemble those in the pseudogap state .",
    "it is useful to compare the energy scales for the various experiments that reveal the presence of a pseudogap .",
    "the maximum gap seen in arpes experiment is about @xmath192  @xmath10 ( 45 mev ) whereas the c - axis conductivity ( in ybco ) shows an onset at @xmath193@xmath10 ( 25 mev ) rising to a plateau at  360  @xmath10 ( 45  mev ) .",
    "the ab plane @xmath32 scale is considerably higher with the steepest part of the curve at @xmath194@xmath10 ( 62  mev ) merging with the high frequency linear curve around 750  @xmath10 ( 93 mev ) in all of the materials studied .",
    "another high energy scale is the energy range of the depression of c - axis conductivity at the superconducting transition  of the order of or larger than 600  @xmath10 .",
    "thus it appears to us that the energy scales associated with the pseudogap and with the superconducting state are different . in y124 crystals with zn substitution ,",
    "superconductivity persists while the pseudogap is suppressed .",
    "we also note that in all samples we find finite absorption extending down to the lowest frequencies . in an @xmath195-wave superconductivity scenario ,",
    "this absorption implies a very anisotropic superconducting gap . as for the @xmath196-wave gap models ,",
    "our data may be consistent with the theoretical predictions@xcite only if one assumes a significant amount of impurities present in the crystals .",
    "this assumption is , however , inconsistent with the linear penetration depth observed in the high quality ybco crystals used in this work.@xcite    although changes in @xmath72 upon crossing into the superconducting regime in the optimally doped cuprates are apparently dramatic , it may simply be due to the simultaneous formation of the pseudogap and superconducting condensate . also , as noted above , it is only in the c - axis conductivity where we see evidence of a larger energy scale associated with the superconducting state.@xcite    in superconducting state , the spectra of the effective mass are remarkably similar in all crystals we have studied . in particular , the absolute value of @xmath197 is about 4 both in y123 and y124 materials .",
    "as noted in section iii , the zero frequency extrapolation of the effective mass gives a square of a ratio of the total plasma frequency , @xmath136 , to the plasma frequency of the superconducting condensate , @xmath198 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the results obtained directly from the use of the sum rule analysis of @xmath12 or from an analysis of the imaginary part of the conductivity .",
    "the fact that the zero - frequency extrapolations of the effective mass are roughly the same , @xmath199 , for all underdoped materials suggests that the superfluid condensate density scales with the total carrier density in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "therefore , we conclude that there are no pairbreaking effects in the pseudogap state .",
    "however , as doping is increased above optimal , the mass enhancement becomes weaker , which indicates a decrease in the superfluid density .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the earlier @xmath200sr results.@xcite      in fig .",
    "[ phase - dia1 ] we showed a phase diagram where the characteristic temperatures @xmath2 ( determined from the @xmath3-axis conductivity ) and @xmath0 for several different samples from the ybco family are plotted as a function of superfluid density @xmath201 in the cuo@xmath6 planes .",
    "the superfluid density is obtained from the optical conductivity as described in section iii .",
    "our choice of superfluid density rather than @xmath79 of the normal - state carriers is governed by the fact that the former quantity could be determined unambiguously from the real part of the ab plane infrared conductivity . from under- to optimally - doped regimes the critical temperature scales with the superfluid density in the cuo@xmath6 planes and the @xmath0 points for yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath147 and yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath202 crystals fall on the universal dependence first proposed by uemura _",
    "et al._@xcite the @xmath0 of y124 is 20  @xmath162 above the universal line .",
    "the @xmath0 _ v.s .",
    "_ @xmath203 boundary in the phase diagram is well defined since both @xmath0 and @xmath203 could be determined very accurately .",
    "however , the @xmath2 _ v.s . _",
    "@xmath203 boundary can not be determined with same high precision since the uncertainty in @xmath2 is about 20 - 30  k , based on the @xmath3-axis conductivity data .",
    "the four @xmath2 points correspond to the following crystals : @xmath204  k - y123 crystal with @xmath142 , @xmath205 k - y123 with @xmath206,@xcite @xmath207  k - y124 crystal and for y123 with @xmath21 @xmath208  k. the variation of @xmath2 between the different ybco samples significantly exceeds the error in the absolute value of @xmath2 .",
    "so far crystals with the oxygen content less than @xmath209 have not been investigated in detail .",
    "thus it is unclear if the pseudogap temperature continues to grow as one approaches the insulating region in the phase diagram or if it saturates at the level of 300 - 400  k.      at the time of writing this survey of the @xmath1-plane pseudogap phenomenon , there remain many open questions .",
    "the first question that must be addressed is whether or not the pseudogap state is generic among all high-@xmath0 materials . in particular , does anything similar exist for non - cuprate superconductors such as bkbo or reni@xmath6b@xmath6c .",
    "it has been suggested that the pseudogap is a manifestation of interlayer coupling and is specific to the double layer materials such as ybco and bi2212.@xcite support for this view comes from nmr measurements , which show a rather weak depression of magnetic susceptibility in la214 in the temperature range where the transport data show evidence of a strong suppression of scattering . as we have seen from our presentation of the data for overdoped single - plane tl2201 samples , the @xmath1-plane @xmath72 curves look similar to those of the two - plane materials _ in the superconducting state_.    experimental optical data exists for the one plane la214 material @xcite which , in the underdoped regime , shows a very strong depression in @xmath72 at low temperatures which is consistent with the pseudogap picture .",
    "however , one must be cautious at this stage since the data from various laboratories show considerable variation in the magnitude of the effect . in some cases , the structure in reflectivity is so strong that it produces an unphysical singularity in the @xmath72 curves.@xcite more work on a range of samples must be done for this system .",
    "similar strong features are seen in the electron - doped nd@xmath15ce@xmath8cuo@xmath13",
    "material.@xcite    it has been suggested that the one - component model of charge transport in the cuprates is particularly unsuited for the la214 system where , at least at low doping levels , @xmath40 shows a separate midinfrared band@xcite rather than a smooth free - carrier band with excess conductivity at high frequencies .",
    "it is also known that at very low doping levels , in the insulating state , there is a separate band or several bands @xcite and a one component picture is clearly inappropriate .    another important effect that needs to be examined is the role of impurities .",
    "we have seen that zn has the effect of destroying the pseudogap in y124 , both in the @xmath3-axis @xmath12 and in the @xmath1-plane @xmath72 curves which acquire a frequency dependence similar to what is seen in the overdoped materials .",
    "zn is an impurity that has a strong effect on @xmath0 and a systematic study of the influence of zn may help us to isolate its effect on @xmath2 , the onset of the pseudogap phase , and @xmath0 , the onset of superconductivity .",
    "phonons play an important , if perhaps subsidiary , role in high temperature superconductivity . as we have seen in section iii ,",
    "the standard electron - phonon mechanism predicts a temperature dependent @xmath72 at all frequencies whereas the observations in the pseudogap state show a temperature independent high - frequency @xmath72 . on the other hand",
    ", the frequency range of the steepest rise of @xmath72 falls in the oxygen mode region of the phonon spectrum and seems to vary little with temperature , chemical composition or doping .",
    "this inertness of the pseudogap frequency suggests that phonons may be involved in some indirect way .",
    "one process that affects the @xmath1-plane conductivity in all high-@xmath0 materials is the coupling of the @xmath1-plane electrodynamic response to @xmath3-axis lo phonons.@xcite to separate this process from other processes , it is necessary to measure the in - plane optical response on the @xmath210 face of an underdoped crystal where the lo@xmath211 coupled structure vanishes.@xcite    the signature of the pseudogap state of ybco materials is that the in - plane conductivity is enhanced whereas the interplane conductivity is suppressed .",
    "it is important to find out whether this is manifested by other cuprates .",
    "in our review of the recent optical data , we see that there is a universal depression of the real part of the memory function @xmath90 , or @xmath72 , below an energy of the order of 700 - 800  @xmath10 in all underdoped materials below a characteristic temperature @xmath2 . at the optimal doping level @xmath212 and in the strongly overdoped regime the gap - like depression is not seen . while the high - frequency @xmath72 was found to be temperature - independent in the underdoped cuprates , an obvious temperature dependence is seen in the strongly overdoped cuprates .",
    "we believe that these optical results add to the growing evidence for the existence of a normal state pseudogap in the physical response function of the underdoped htsc .    while intense theoretical work has been done to explain the observed phenomenon , none of it has been completely successful .",
    "it is necessary for any theoretical model to explain not only the formation of the gap in the @xmath1-plane response , but also a wealth of phenomena , such as the @xmath3-axis transport and the remarkable temperature dependencies that are observed , both for the @xmath3-axis pseudogap as well as the @xmath1-plane response .",

    "_ proposed a somewhat similar way of differentiating the two contributions.@xcite they suggest that the response of conducting carriers completely collapses into a @xmath115-function at @xmath214 .",

    "while this approach appears to be useful under the circumstances and allows one to extract the temperature dependence of the scattering rate below @xmath0 , it also has serious deficiencies .",
    "the most significant one stems from the fact that the conductivity in the superconducting state remains finite down to the lowest available frequencies and even increases in a drude - like fashion at @xmath215 @xmath10 ( fig .",
