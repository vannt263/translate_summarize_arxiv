    "the effective lagrangian involving anomalous @xmath0 couplings can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the anomalous coupling , with @xmath5 denoting an up or charm quark and @xmath6 a photon or @xmath7-boson with field tensor @xmath8 ; @xmath9 with @xmath10 the dirac matrices ; and @xmath11 is an effective scale which we set equal to the top quark mass , @xmath12 .",
    "the present tev energy scale colliders  tevatron and hera can probe fcnc interactions in the top - quark sector and set limits on @xmath13 and @xmath14 . however , there are large uncertainties in the lowest - order results from variation of the factorization / renormalization scales , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the stabilization of the cross section for these fcnc processes is timely and important .",
    "we have calculated next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) soft - gluon corrections for the following processes : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 at the tevatron @xcite ; and @xmath19 at hera @xcite . as a result",
