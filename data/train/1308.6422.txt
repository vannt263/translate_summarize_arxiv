    "a young _ chara _ cell is modeled as a cylinder of radius @xmath1 with periodic boundaries at a distance @xmath2 apart .",
    "the fixed chloroplasts lie at the edge , with the subcortical cytoplasm a thin cylindrical layer between the chloroplasts and the vacuolar membrane ; the vacuole then comprises the bulk of the cell .",
    "the cytoplasm is taken to consist of a layer of short , initially disordered actin filaments beneath a layer of myosin - coated endoplasmic reticulum vesicles , which drive flow by forcing the cytoplasm as they process on the actin filaments ( fig .  [",
    "fig:1]c ) . because the subcortical layer is very thin compared to the vacuole , we approximate the cytoplasmic layer as a purely two - dimensional cylindrical shell .",
    "we also assume that the effective viscosity contrast between cytoplasm and vacuolar fluid is sufficiently large to take vacuolar flow as purely passive , induced by cytoplasmic flow  @xcite but not affecting it .",
    "this yields a truly two - dimensional problem .",
    "our final simplification is to neglect the helical twist in the streaming pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b ) .",
    "no discernible twist exists in young cells with developed actin cables  @xcite , so its appearance is more likely connected to later development of the microtubule cytoskeleton  @xcite by a process of twisting growth once the main cables are established and bound to the cortical chloroplasts  @xcite .",
    "the twist appears to be advantageous primarily for large , mature cells , where it enhances vacuolar mixing and nutrient uptake  @xcite .",
    "we will now formalize the hydrodynamics . endow the shell with cylindrical coordinates @xmath3 and corresponding unit vectors @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the velocity field of the suspending cytoplasmic fluid .",
    "the small velocity of streaming allows us to work in the zero reynolds number limit .",
    "we then take @xmath6 to obey the forced stokes equations with friction , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the two - dimensional pressure and @xmath9 is the filament - induced forcing , discussed shortly .",
    "the frictional term @xmath10 captures the effect of the no - slip boundary proximity in our thin - shell approximation , in a manner similar to hele - shaw flow ( si text ) .",
    "there are two crucial constraints on the flow field that must be incorporated .",
    "first , because the tonoplast membrane , which separates the cytoplasm and vacuole , behaves as a two - dimensional incompressible fluid  @xcite , we must have _ incompressibility _ @xmath11 .",
    "second , the presence of end caps on the cell must be acknowledged , either through explicit modeling of the end geometry or , as we do here , qualitatively through the simple extra constraint of _ zero net flux _",
    "@xmath12 , essentially due to the incompressibility of a finite domain in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "this is balanced by allowing a longitudinal pressure gradient @xmath14 and writing @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the remaining fully periodic pressure field .",
    "we now turn to the filament suspension , whose dynamics will incorporate several crucial effects .",
    "the filaments are taken to be _ restricted _ : passive advection and shear alignment in the flow @xmath6 is inhibited by a factor @xmath17 due to frictional or binding effects of the filaments on the chloroplasts or with cortical polymer networks . as a consequence of restriction ,",
    "the filaments are _ non - self - advective _ : a vesicle walking forwards on a filament will induce only a negligible backward propulsion of the filament itself .",
    "the filaments are also taken to _",
    "spontaneously bundle _ : filaments will locally align with each other , controlled by a coupling constant @xmath18 ( a rate constant for the exponential growth of small local polarization ) , mimicking the presence of bundling proteins . ( inhibiting",
    "the action of bundling proteins thus corresponds to setting @xmath19 . )    to represent non - spherical cellular geometry or substrate patterning we include a _ repulsive direction _ @xmath20 which filaments will preferentially avoid , with coupling constant @xmath21 ( fig .  [ fig:3]a ) ; this will be set here to @xmath22 , the circumferential direction . while apparently a strong assumption , there is remarkable experimental precedent for such an effect whereby filaments can reorient circumferentially around cells upon inhibition of binding or director components @xcite .",
    "in the absence of any other contributing factors , the effects described above will tend to produce a uniformly polarized suspension in a direction perpendicular to @xmath20 .",
    "there is one more key factor : _ polar flow alignment _ , with coupling constant @xmath23 ( encoding the linear growth rate of filament polarization with cytoplasm flow , similar to @xmath18 ) .",
    "we argue that the presence of myosin - coated vesicles brings about alignment of the filaments with the flow field @xmath6 itself in a truly polar fashion , minus end upstream and plus end downstream , supplementing traditional nematic alignment with flow shear @xmath24 .",
    "suppose that a motor - laden vesicle approaches a filament , advected by a net background flow @xmath6 from the action of other vesicles processing along filaments nearby .",
    "there are then three basic cases to consider for the filament orientation relative to the flow . if the vesicle approaches a microfilament oriented parallel with @xmath6that is , minus end upstream so the myosin walk direction is with the flow  then the vesicle can bind , process along the filament at a speed @xmath25 , and unbind with little change to the filament ( fig .  [",
    "fig:3]b ) .",
    "this implies parallel flow alignment is stable .",
    "anti - parallel alignment , with plus end upstream and walk direction against the flow , is unstable : a vesicle bound upstream on the filament will be impeded from walking by hydrodynamic drag , stall on the restricted filament , and twist it into the flow ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c ) .",
    "finally , perpendicular alignment induces reorientation either parallel or anti - parallel to the flow upon binding of a vesicle , because a torque is generated by the competition of filament restriction against hydrodynamic drag ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]d ) .",
    "this effect is not unique to microfilaments : thin - film dumbbell microswimmers are subject to the same polar alignment , driven by asymmetric friction forces @xcite .     either to minimize physical curvature , or minimize interactions .",
    "( b - d ) polar flow reorientation : rather than aligning nematically with flow shear , filaments can align in a polar fashion with flow itself .",
    "alignment with the plus end downstream is stable ( b ) , but hydrodynamic drag on vesicles bound to the filament competes with friction from wall restriction when the motor is not free to walk downstream ( c , d ) .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ]    for this reorientation mechanism to occur and be robust ( that is , stable when oriented parallel with the flow ) , there are two important conditions .",
    "first , the timescale @xmath26 for filament reorientation must be shorter than the timescale @xmath27 for motor detachment after stalling @xcite in order for any appreciable filament reorientation to occur in the flow - antiparallel and flow - perpendicular cases .",
    "second , the timescale @xmath28 for a motor to process along a flow - parallel filament must be shorter than the filament reorientation timescale @xmath26 , in order for orientation parallel with the flow to be stable ; if this is not the case , then no orientation is stable , and the filament will writhe continuously over time irrespective of its orientation relative to the background flow .",
    "thus , we require @xmath29",
    ". the sliding speed @xmath30 @xcite on @xmath31 filaments yields a quick procession timescale @xmath32 .",
    "by contrast , it has been suggested that the very fast streaming may in fact be due to the action of many non - processive motors on one vesicle acting simultaneously @xcite which would likely yield a long stall detachment time @xmath33 due to the long dwell time of individual characean myosins @xcite .",
    "microfluidic studies indicate that the reorientation timescale @xmath26 lies in - between these two extremes @xcite , indicating that this reorientation mechanism is indeed viable .    to describe the microfilaments we use a formalism from the theory of ` active suspensions ' @xcite .",
    "the full derivation of the dynamics can be found in the si text ; we summarize it here , as follows . at each point @xmath34 on the cylinder ,",
    "define the angular distribution function @xmath35 of microfilaments with unit direction @xmath36 . from this , we define the local filament concentration @xmath37 and average orientation director @xmath38 .",
    "the distribution @xmath35 obeys a smoluchowski equation , whose orientational moments yield the dynamics of the concentration and director fields after applying a simple moment closure approximation , whose viability is discussed further in the si text .",
    "our non - self - advective supposition then reduces the concentration dynamics to pure advection - diffusion ( si text ) , allowing us to neglect fluctuations and reduce to a _ uniform concentration _ @xmath39 .",
    "the system is closed by defining the flow forcing @xmath9 . as the filaments are restricted by frictional forces with the outer wall ,",
    "the primary contribution of a vesicle processing along a filament is a point force ( i.e. a stokeslet ) , suggesting a simple relationship @xmath40 .",
    "however , global streaming does not persist in the presence of filament unbundling agents , while the actin - myosin interaction remains uninhibited  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the flow does not play a role in the linear stability of a disordered suspension , implying that the force must be nonlinear in the local alignment @xmath41 ( si text ) .",
    "we take the lowest nonlinear order permitted by symmetry and write @xmath42 .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath43 encodes the force per unit area generated by vesicles processing along perfectly aligned filaments , and thus includes all information relating to vesicle number , procession speed and binding rates .",
    "the last step is to non - dimensionalize all variables and coupling constants ; we scale space by the radius @xmath1 and choose rescalings to eliminate the friction coefficient @xmath44 and the forcing constant @xmath43 ( si text ) . the final dynamics for @xmath41 read @xmath45\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all coupling constants are now non - dimensional .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are spatial and rotational diffusion constants , respectively .",
    "the final hydrodynamics read @xmath48 subject to @xmath49 all fields have periodic boundary conditions on @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the non - dimensional cell length .",
    "to test the model and understand more about the regimes of behavior it possesses , we ran numerical integrations of the system starting from initial conditions of randomly perturbed total filament disorder ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 were fixed at representative values @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 in order to focus on the most important coupling constants @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "we also chose @xmath58 as an appropriate radius - to - length ratio for a young cell with observably organized actin cables  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] displays a typical time sequence for numerical integration of the model with an illustrative choice of the parameters @xmath59 .",
    "the experimentally observed regeneration progression @xcite is clearly reproduced as it moves from disorder , through small patches of locally ordered ` streamlets ' caused by spontaneous polarization , and settles into fully developed cyclosis as the passive and active reorienting effects of flow reach full potency .",
    "while the polar flow alignment is important for establishing the global streaming pattern , it is worth remarking that the traditional nematic shear alignment , though damped by the restriction factor @xmath17 , still plays a role : it acts to smooth out curved iz boundaries between adjacent up- and down - streaming regions , where flow shear is high , into straight lines .",
    "this is seen in the later stages of the time evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .      to gauge the model s robustness , we executed a numerical parameter sweep of non - zero @xmath18 and @xmath23 both between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the parameter space was divided up into a @xmath62 grid , and the full set of parameters was simulated for each of 50 different instances of random initial conditions . combined with a linear stability analysis ( si text ) , this detects three distinct regimes ( fig .  [ fig:5 ] ) : disorder ( d ) , cyclosis / unidirectional coexistence ( c / u ) and full cyclosis ( c ) .",
    "parameters in region d have @xmath18 too low for spontaneous order to flourish , where the disordered state @xmath63 is linearly stable . in region",
    "c / u , the system may evolve into either the cyclosis state or the unidirectional state @xmath64 ( where @xmath65 is a constant ) .",
    "which steady state is reached is dependent on the precise nature of the initial conditions , a consequence of co - existence of basins of attraction in the neighborhood of the fourier space origin .",
    "parameters in region c always developed the desired cyclosis solutions for all sets of initial conditions , indicating that the basin of attraction of the unidirectional state is now negligible .",
    "these regimes can be understood further by considering the simplified one - dimensional regime of @xmath66-independent and @xmath66-parallel alignment , i.e. @xmath67 ; see the si text .     and",
    "@xmath23 between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with other parameters held fixed as in the text .",
    "the entire set of @xmath62 parameters was simulated for 50 different random initial conditions , uncovering regions of cyclosis / unidirectional bistability ( c / u ) and fully robust cyclosis ( c ) .",
    "color - coding in region c / u denotes the percentage of the initial conditions that developed into steady cyclosis states at each pair of parameters .",
    "region d , where @xmath68 , is linearly stable and develops no streaming .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ]      the one - dimensional simplification also allows us to consider the model in the context of pattern formation theory .",
    "when @xmath69 the system assumes non - conservative allen - cahn form , for which it can be shown that a spatially oscillating state is always unstable ; consequently , fronts separating regions of upward and downward alignment will always eventually coalesce  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath70 introduces a difficult non - local term which can not be written as the gradient of some free energy functional .",
    "in fact , for @xmath23 above a small threshold , cyclosis solutions are stabilized by global flow alignment effects .",
    "the exact threshold as a function of @xmath18 can be determined by fixing @xmath18 and varying @xmath23 in order to compute trajectories of eigenvalues of the non - local sturm - liouville problem induced by linear stability analysis .",
    "this is discussed further in the si text .",
    "we have demonstrated the capability of this model for simulating the emergence of characean streaming . for the computational study , we focussed on the roles of the polarization and flow - coupling constants @xmath18 and @xmath23 .",
    "perhaps the next most important parameter is the directional repulsion @xmath21 , which we have not investigated in detail here .",
    "the value we chose , @xmath56 , is a nice intermediate providing a definite preference for upwards orientation , but not so strong as to completely dominate the early - time dynamics . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath21 is too small , then little or no directional effects are felt , and the dynamics may be either unsteady or settle into circumferential flows .",
    "in fact , studies of poor , malformed streaming induced _ in vivo _ hint at the true effects of removing directional preference .",
    "conversely , a suitable model for streaming should be able to reproduce observed pathologies and experimental disruptions , at least qualitatively , and it is these we now briefly discuss .",
    "total cable fragmentation  @xcite has already been mentioned , and directly corresponds to setting @xmath19 to inhibit bundling effects .",
    "there is also the possibility of atypical reorganization of the actin cables ; to our knowledge , such behavior has not yet been induced in characean cells .",
    "nevertheless , it has been documented in other types of orderly streaming plant cells , with which a direct comparison can be made owing to the generality of this approach .",
    "on inhibiting the binding of the cell membrane to the cell wall , actin cables in _ vallisneria _ mesophyll cells can reorient from longitudinal to circumferential , running around the long axis  @xcite .",
    "similar reorientation can be induced in _",
    "_ pollen tubes , where actin cables reorient circumferentially in regions lacking longitudinal microtubules  @xcite .",
    "both studies supply evidence for the restriction and repulsive direction components of our model .",
    "even though these atypical streaming arrangements were not induced during cell development , such a configuration can be reproduced by choosing parameters appropriately ( si text and fig .",
    "we have considered the bases of @xmath18 ( bundling ) , @xmath21 ( geometric reorientation ) and @xmath17 ( restriction ) , but how might one experimentally account for the polar alignment coefficient @xmath23 ?",
    "setting @xmath71 corresponds to inhibiting the ability of myosin to walk on actin . in the characeae",
    "one would also have to disorganize the filament network  @xcite to observe its effect from a base state .",
    "we would then expect a unidirectional streaming pattern to emerge , or at least a metastable cyclosis with unequal widths of opposing streams , as the filaments bundle .",
    "such an experiment would be an exciting test of the principal ideas on which this conceptually simple yet powerful self - organization model has been built .",
    "simulations were performed using spectral methods , evaluating gradients and evolving in time in fourier space and moving into physical space to evaluate nonlinearities .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions were then implicit in choosing a fourier basis .",
    "explicit 4th - order runge - kutta integration was used for time evolution .",
    "for all simulations , the initial conditions were of total filament disorder as follows .",
    "suppose in a small area @xmath72 there are @xmath73 filaments whose orientations @xmath74 , @xmath75 , are uniformly distributed , i.e. @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "then since the @xmath78 are independent and identically distributed random variables , the central limit theorem applies to @xmath79 , giving that @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , to model an initial distribution of @xmath73 filaments per grid square , initial conditions are drawn as @xmath83 .",
