    "being a bulk real - space probe , with information about the precession and relaxation rates of nuclear spins at different sites inside the sample , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) has served as one of the key experimental tools@xcite in the study of the electronic properties of high temperature cuprate superconductors ( hts ) . by and large , the @xmath2o nmr data@xcite on hts , in moderate to large magnetic fields ,",
    "has been interpreted as evidence for antiferromagnetic ( af ) order in the vortex core@xcite .",
    "this interpretation was based on the dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath3 , for the cu nuclei in the normal state ; the rate remains constant with temperature@xcite , as opposed to being linear in @xmath4 , as predicted by the korringa law@xcite .",
    "we reexamine this interpretation using analytical and numerical solutions of the the bogoliubov - de  gennes equations and find that the present data can be understood quantitatively without invoking af ordering .",
    "in particular , the low temperature upturn in @xmath5 near the vortex core , but not away from it , can be understood to be caused by a combination of two effects : 1 ) the increase of the quasiparticle ( qp ) wavefunction near the core and 2 ) the shift of the minimum of the qp band with spin along the applied magnetic field ( spin up ) to negative energies due to zeeman coupling . as a result ,",
    "a new electronic channel opens up for relaxing the nuclear spin whereby a _ pair _ of spin up quasiparticles is emitted or absorbed .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard `` spin - flip '' channel , in which a spin up(down ) qp is destroyed and a spin down(up ) qp is created . at temperatures below the zeeman",
    "scale the latter channel freezes out since the number of qp s with spin anti - aligned with the @xmath6-field becomes thermally activated , and the former channel dominates .",
    "in addition , we find that the broad nmr lineshape appears even in the extreme type - ii limit , where the diamagnetic response of the @xmath7-field induced supercurrents can be neglected . the broadening here",
    "is found to be due to the spatially non - uniform _ paramagnetic _ response of @xmath0-wave superconductors in the vortex state .",
    "several other theoretical investigations of nmr in the mixed state of the cuprate superconductors have been carried out .",
    "one of the earliest treatments was that of takigawa _ et.al._@xcite using a self - consistent method of solution of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations due to wang and macdonald@xcite .",
    "they found that @xmath3 is linear in temperature near the vortex cores at low temperatures and exhibits a small , hebel - slichter - like , peak near the superconducting transition temperature . at low temperature ,",
    "the rates near the core are also found to be larger than the rates away from it , which approach the usual @xmath8 dependence .",
    "nmr in the @xmath0-wave mixed state was also studied using a semiclassical approach@xcite , and using a linearized form of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations@xcite .",
    "the results of the linearized model give faster rates near the vortex cores than away from them .",
    "they found that @xmath5 near the core increases slowly with temperature up to @xmath9 , and remains almost constant over the same temperature range away from the core .",
    "importantly , these works focused on the quasiparticle spin - flip channel , but , as mentioned above and as we show in more detail below , the zeeman coupling of the quasiparticles , which can not be ignored at large magnetic fields , introduces an additional channel for spin - lattice relaxation which is found to dominate at low temperature .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we state the full hamiltonian of our system and review the basic formulas for the knight shift and @xmath10 . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce our model for the electronic contribution to the hamiltonian , derive the formulas for the knight shift and @xmath10 for this model , and present the results of our calculations . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the possible influence of antiferromagnetic correlations",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions in sec . v.",
    "we will start by stating the hamiltonian describing our system .",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the electrons on their own , @xmath13 is that of the nuclei on their own , and @xmath14 is the hyperfine interaction between the electrons and nuclei .",
    "the nuclear contribution is just the total energy of the nuclear spins in an applied magnetic field , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei and @xmath17 is the spin of the nucleus at @xmath18 .",
    "there are other terms present , such as quadrupole terms and interactions among the nuclei@xcite .",
    "however , in large magnetic fields , which we will be considering here , these terms are small compared to the above magnetic term .",
    "the quadrupole terms lead to uneven splitting of the nuclear energies , and the interactions may lead to a slight broadening of the resonances of the nuclei@xcite .",
    "we use the model of shastry , mila , and rice@xcite for the hyperfine interaction , @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath16 are the gyromagnetic ratios of an electron and a nucleus , respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are their respective spin angular momenta , and the coefficients @xmath23 are the form factors for the hyperfine interaction@xcite .",
    "note that we are taking @xmath20 to have a negative value",
    ". the electronic contribution will be the subject of the next section .    to compare our results to experiments@xcite",
    ", we will be interested in the relaxation rates and the knight shifts for the in - plane @xmath2o atoms in ybco .",
    "for these atoms , we include the contributions to the form factor @xmath23 from both nearest- ( n.n . ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( n.n.n . ) copper atoms : @xmath24 is equal to @xmath25 for the n.n .",
    "cu atoms , and @xmath26 for the n.n.n .",
    "cu atoms@xcite .",
    "as discussed by zha , barzykin , and pines@xcite , this form factor suppresses contributions from the af correlations to the spin - lattice relaxation rate at o - sites in the normal state .",
    "we expect this suppression to persist in the mixed state , as we will argue in section iv .",
    "the knight shift is a change ( usually an increase ) in the nuclear resonance frequency induced by the surrounding electrons@xcite .",
    "this can be attributed to an effective magnetic field produced by the electrons through the hyperfine coupling to the nucleus .",
    "using first - order time - independent perturbation theory on this term and taking the thermal average of the result , we get @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the effective magnetic field experienced by the nuclei and produced by the electrons ; @xmath29 denotes a thermal average .",
    "because the nuclear resonance frequency , @xmath30 , is proportional to the applied magnetic field , this means that the resonance frequency is shifted by an amount @xmath31 .",
    "we will use this formula in the next section to determine the knight shift in a @xmath0-wave superconductor in a magnetic field .",
    "note that the above formulas , in general , allow for a position dependence of the effective magnetic field ; the knight shift in our system will , in fact , be position dependent .",
    "as is well known@xcite , the spin - lattice relaxation rate at @xmath18 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy of the nucleus at @xmath18 in a state @xmath34 , and it is assumed that @xmath35 .",
    "we will also assume that the energies are equally spaced , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "this is not exactly true , due to , for example , the quadrupole term , but , because we are working in high magnetic fields , such contributions beyond the magnetic energy are small , and we may treat the eigenstates of this term alone as almost exact , which is one of the assumptions made in the use of this formula@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath37 entering eq.([1t1 ] ) is the transition rate for the @xmath38 component ( along the h - field ) of the nuclear spin at site @xmath18 to go from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "we can find these rates using fermi s golden rule , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the hyperfine interaction in the form , @xmath43    we will employ these formulas to determine the spin - lattice relaxation rate in a @xmath0-wave superconductor in a magnetic field in the next section .",
    "again , note that our formulas , in general , allow for a position dependence of the relaxation rate and the knight shift .",
    "we now discuss the electronic contribution to the hamiltonian . our starting point will be the hamiltonian for electrons on a square tight - binding lattice in a magnetic field with a singlet pairing term @xmath44\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\sum_{{{\\bf r}}}{{\\hat c}_{{{\\bf r}}\\alpha}^{\\dag}\\left(\\mu\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}+h\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}^z\\right){\\hat c}_{{{\\bf r}}\\beta}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tight - binding hopping constants , @xmath45 are @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the vector potential associated with the ( constant ) applied magnetic field @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the spin magnetic moment of an electron , and @xmath50 is the chemical potential . for the symmetric gauge @xmath51 ,",
    "the values of @xmath52 relevant for a square lattice are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the magnetic flux through a plaquette , and @xmath56 is the flux quantum . the pairing field @xmath57 is assumed to have a constant magnitude and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 , otherwise @xmath60 .",
    "the phase factor @xmath61 satisfies the equations , @xmath62 , where the @xmath63 are the positions of the vortex cores , and @xmath64 .",
    "these conditions determine @xmath65 up to terms of the form @xmath66 ; these constants are fixed by requiring zero overall current .",
    "the vortex cores form a periodic abrikosov lattice , such that each primitive cell ( magnetic unit cell ) of this lattice carries exactly one quantum of magnetic flux @xmath67 .",
    "note that our assumption of a constant magnetic field effectively corresponds to an infinite penetration depth . we choose to assume a pairing field of constant amplitude , placing all of the vortex physics into the phase .",
    "we do so because we believe that assuming a constant amplitude , as opposed to calculating it self - consistently , will not greatly affect our results . lacking a microscopic model for cuprate superconductors , it is uncertain whether a self - consistent calculation will result in much improvement of our results",
    ". finally , for notational convenience we denote the zeeman factor by @xmath68 .",
    "our method of solution for this problem follows refs.@xcite . to diagonalize this hamiltonian",
    ", we introduce the singular gauge - bogoliubov de  gennes transformation@xcite @xmath69 which allows us to rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the quasiparticles in the bloch basis corresponding to the magnetic unit cell @xmath70 containing a pair of vortices . by bloch",
    "s theorem the nambu spinors , which are eigenfunctions of the bogoliubov - de  gennes equation@xcite , can be written as @xmath71^t = e^{i{{\\bf k}}\\cdot{{\\bf r}}}[u_{{{\\bf k}}n}({{\\bf r}}),v_{{{\\bf k}}n}({{\\bf r}})]^t$ ] , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are periodic in @xmath70 , @xmath34 is the band index and the crystal momentum @xmath74\\times(-\\frac{\\pi}{\\ell_y},\\frac{\\pi}{\\ell_y}]$ ] .",
    "there is one issue introduced by this transformation that is worth addressing in detail .",
    "as we wind around a vortex , @xmath65 increases by @xmath75 .",
    "this means that the phase factors in the above gauge transformation only increase by @xmath76 , meaning that the phase factors , at this point , are not uniquely determined .",
    "we must therefore introduce branch cuts into the hamiltonian and choose the values of the phase factors carefully .",
    "the procedure we use in choosing the values of these factors is that used in ref.@xcite .",
    "we first choose a branch cut , which can be any continuous curve connecting the two vortices inside the magnetic unit cell .",
    "we then choose one point @xmath77 on the atomic lattice , and let the phase factor for that site be @xmath78 .",
    "we now move to a neighboring site @xmath18 such that we do not need to cross the branch cut to reach it .",
    "let @xmath79 be the phase factor for this site .",
    "the solution to @xmath80 that we choose is the one that gives the lower value of @xmath81 .",
    "we do this for all sites , thus generating the appropriate values for @xmath82 .",
    "this process is illustrated in figure [ phasefactors ] .",
    "illustration of the process by which we choose the values of @xmath82 for each site for a @xmath83 magnetic unit cell .",
    "the large circles represent the sites , and the small circles the bonds connecting them .",
    "the blue dots are the locations of the vortex cores , and the dashed blue line is the branch cut .",
    "the black arrows represent the site phase factors , @xmath84 , while the orange arrows represent the value of @xmath82 chosen by the process outlined in the text .",
    "the bond phase variable , @xmath85 , is represented by the gray arrow , and @xmath86 is represented by the red arrow . ]    the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 satisfy the bogoliubov - de gennes equation , @xmath87 , where @xmath88^t$ ] , @xmath89 , the operators @xmath90 and @xmath91 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 performs a translation along the vector @xmath94 .",
    "we now wish to make a comment on the energies of the quasiparticles in our system .",
    "let @xmath95  that is , @xmath96 is @xmath97 without the zeeman term",
    ". note that diagonalizing @xmath96 is the same as diagonalizing @xmath97 because the two differ only by a term proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "in fact , if we let @xmath98 be the eigenvalues of @xmath96 , then the eigenvalues of @xmath97 are just @xmath99 .",
    "the matrix @xmath96 , as we implied , would replace @xmath97 if we neglected the zeeman splitting .",
    "since we can simultaneously diagonalize @xmath97 and @xmath96 , we see that the same eigenvectors would diagonalize the difference between the two hamiltonians that result in these matrices , which is a term proportional to the @xmath38 component of the spin . this is because the @xmath38 component of the spin is a good quantum number , and can be used to label the elementary excitations .",
    "we note that @xmath100^{\\ast}=\\sigma_y\\mathcal{\\hat h}_{0,nz}^{\\ast}\\sigma_y \\cr = -\\sigma_z(\\mathcal{\\hat e}_{{{\\bf r}}}-\\mu)-\\sigma_x{\\hat\\delta}_{{{\\bf r}}}=-\\mathcal{\\hat h}_{0,nz}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this shows that , if we multiply an eigenvector of @xmath96 by @xmath101 and then take the complex conjugate of the result , then we obtain another eigenvector of the same matrix , but with the negative of the eigenvalue of the original vector .",
    "this is exactly what we did to obtain @xmath102 from @xmath103 .",
    "we have thus shown that the spinor @xmath103 is an eigenvector of @xmath96 with eigenvalue @xmath104 , and therefore also an eigenvector of @xmath97 with eigenvalue @xmath105 .",
    "the fact that we can generate the negative - energy states from the positive - energy ones implies that we may take the sum in equation to be over states that give positive eigenvalues of @xmath96 .",
    "we could also choose , for example , the states with negative eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , we may choose any one of these two possibilities for each term .",
    "in this paper , we conform to widely - used convention and use the positive energy eigenvalues .",

    "these calculations were done for optimally - doped ybco , for which @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "because we wish to calculate thermodynamic properties of the system at low temperatures ( temperatures up to @xmath9 ) , we only needed to find some of the lower energy bands .",
    "thus , we used the arnoldi method to find the energies and wave functions , and we discretized the reciprocal lattice into a @xmath124 grid .",
    "let us now make some comments on the energy spectrum and the wave functions .",
    "first , we note that , while the energies @xmath98 are all positive , so that no quasiparticles would be present in the ground state of our system if there is no magnetic field , it is possible , under certain circumstances , for some of the energies @xmath125 to be negative . to be exact , @xmath98 for most values of the chemical potential could exhibit a gap",

    ", this translates to spatially varying spin density and by the above two eqs . to the spatially varying knight shift",
    "this means that even nuclei of the same species will have different resonance frequencies depending on their location in the magnetic unit cell .",
    "this results in a broadening of the nmr line shape ( figures [ fig : maglsrr ] and [ fig : maglsrr2 ] ) .",

    "the largest knight shifts occur near the vortices because the local electron density is largest in the same area . in reality , the plots shown are for those o atoms on bonds parallel to the `` short '' axis of the magnetic unit cell ( in this case , the @xmath139 axis ) ; the plots for the atoms on bonds along the @xmath140 axis are similar in appearance .",

    "we note , however , that the corresponding process for spin _ up _ quasiparticles , @xmath161 , does _ not _ violate conservation of energy because some of the spin up quasiparticles have negative energies .",

    "this temperature dependence is in turn due to the pair creation / annihilation processes , i.e the second term in equation .    to generate a dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate on the internal magnetic field",
    ", we associated the rate at a given point and a given temperature with the value of the effective magnetic field shift at that point and temperature .",

    "we now address the issue of how much of an effect antiferromagnetic correlations will have on the spin - lattice relaxation rate of @xmath2o in the vortex state , assuming that the vortex cores represent normal - state regions .",
    "as was mentioned before , it is known that the form factor filters out such correlations in the normal state@xcite . within the simple model presented here , we find that this filtering is still active in the vortex state . to investigate the effect of vortices , we used a modification of the phenomenological model set forth , among others , by zha , barzykin , and pines @xcite .",
    "we start with their expression for the `` antiferromagnetic '' part of the susceptibility , @xmath202 here , @xmath203 is a scale factor , @xmath204 is the antiferromagnetic correlation length , @xmath205 is the bohr magneton , the @xmath206 are the locations of the peaks in the susceptibility found from neutron scattering experiments , @xmath207 is the characteristic frequency of spin fluctuations , and @xmath208 ranges over the entire first brillouin zone@xcite .",
    "we obtained the model we used by rewriting the above susceptibility as a function of position , separating the position dependence into a dependence on the position of a `` magnetic unit cell '' and a dependence on position within the cell , and fourier transforming the result with respect to the magnetic unit cell position .",
    "the result is @xmath209 @xmath210 where @xmath208 now ranges over the first magnetic brillouin zone , @xmath211 is the set of all vectors such that @xmath212 for all @xmath213 in the magnetic lattice and such that @xmath214 is within the first atomic brillouin zone , @xmath215 is the number of magnetic unit cells , and @xmath216 is the number of sites in the atomic lattice .",
    "we note that , assuming an @xmath217 magnetic unit cell , the number of atomic sites is just @xmath218 , so we may simply write @xmath209 @xmath219 so far , we have not introduced a new model ; we only rewrote the original in a more complicated form .",
    "we will now modify this model to introduce vortex effects .",
    "for simplicity , we will assume only one vortex per unit cell .",
    "we model these effects by simply introducing step functions into the susceptibility to restrict the antiferromagnetic correlations to within a distance equal to the superconducting coherence length @xmath220 from the center of the vortex .",
    "the result is @xmath221 @xmath222 we now turn our attention to finding the spin - lattice relaxation rate from this susceptibility . it can be shown that , if we assume that this relaxation is due to the hyperfine interaction , then the spin - lattice relaxation rate will be @xmath223 where @xmath224 is a `` discontinuity '' operator , defined as @xmath225 we may rewrite the above formula for a susceptibility of the form we are working with . by introducing the appropriate fourier transforms ,",
    "we eventually arrive at the desired result , @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are summed over the entire unit cell , @xmath229 is summed over the entire magnetic brillouin zone , and @xmath230 and @xmath231 are summed over the same set of vectors as @xmath211 in equation .",
    "the rest of our work was done numerically .",
    "we used the experimentally - determined parameters given by barzykin and pines for the susceptibility for yba@xmath232cu@xmath233o@xmath234 @xcite .",
    "we first performed a numerical calculation of the rates for @xmath235 for both copper and oxygen without vortices .",
    "the form factors we used are @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the atomic lattice spacing and the parameters , @xmath238 , @xmath6 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 are those given by zha , barzykin , and pines @xcite . because of the fact that the momentum - space points @xmath241 and @xmath242 are both present in the sums in our formulas , equations and should give the same result .",
    "we did this using both equations and to check our formulas .",
    "the temperature range we examined was @xmath243 .",
    "we found that the contributions to the rates for both cu and o decreased with increasing temperature , and that the rates for o were several orders of magnitude smaller than for cu ; such suppression of the rate for o compared to cu has been reported before by mila and rice@xcite .",
    "we then repeated this calculation , this time including vortices .",
    "we set the superconducting coherence length @xmath244 .",
    "we found that the temperature dependence of both rates was qualitatively the same as before , but that the rates were actually enhanced ; the copper rates by an entire order of magnitude and the oxygen rates by a factor of about 4 .",
    "we believe that this is due to the fact that , by imposing the distance cutoff , we removed contributions to the relaxation rate that would have reduced the rate . based on this simplified model , we therefore expect that , not only is the filtering effect still present in the mixed state , but it is , in fact , enhanced .",
    "it goes without saying then that this filtering effect would therefore make oxygen nmr more sensitive to the pair creation and annihilation ( pca ) processes than copper nmr .",
    "this is because the effect of antiferromagnetic correlations is much less for oxygen than for copper , meaning that the pca processes will dominate in oxygen .",
    "in this work , we argued that it is possible to explain the broadening of the line shape and the upturn in the spin - lattice relaxation rate with decreasing temperature observed experimentally @xcite without introducing antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the line shape broadening can be explained , at least in part , by noting that the knight shift varies with position in the lattice in the vortex state .",
    "this position dependence leads to each nucleus having a different resonance frequency , and therefore to a broadened line shape .",
    "the upturn in the relaxation rate can be explained as due to a second relaxation process , namely creation and annihilation of pairs of spin - up quasiparticles , that appears when a magnetic field is applied , and this process dominates at low temperatures .",
    "we do not wish to claim that af correlations do not exist in ybco , only that certain features of the nmr data once attributed to such correlations can be explained without them ; in fact , there is other evidence for the existence of such correlations , namely neutron scattering data@xcite . as we argued in section",
    "iv , even in the presence of af correlations , the spin - lattice relaxation rates for o will not be greatly affected by them due to the form factor .",
    "based on the above arguments we expect that , once the vortex lattice melts and the system enters a vortex liquid phase , the nmr lines sharpen due to motional narrowing@xcite . at the same time , we expect that the spin lattice relaxation rate , @xmath3 , is determined by the faster rates and that the low @xmath4 upturn persists in the vortex liquid .",
    "this picture , and the density of states shown in fig.[fig : dos ] , also predict that if an experiment is performed in a clean thin film with a well - ordered vortex lattice in which the perpendicular component of the @xmath6-field is kept fixed , while changing the magnitude of the total @xmath48 , _ quantum - like oscillations _ in @xmath3 , due to the oscillations of the density of states _ in energy _ , would be observed .    while our calculated line shapes have about the same width as the experimental shape for the @xmath118 case , the shapes for the @xmath120 case have different widths .",
    "one possible contributing factor to this discrepancy is the fact that we neglected the variation of the magnetic field and the pairing amplitude over a unit cell .",
    "we expect the magnetic field to vary more strongly in the @xmath120 case than in the @xmath118 case because the vortices are further apart in the @xmath120 case . in fact , in the @xmath118 case , the distance between the two vortices in a unit cell is about @xmath245 of the penetration depth , while , in the @xmath120 case , this distance is about @xmath246 of the penetration depth .",
    "this variation will introduce further broadening , which will be greater at @xmath120 than at @xmath118 , consistent with our findings .",
    "we also notice that the `` tails '' on our calculated curves are different in length than those of the experimental curves .",
    "we believe that this , once again , is due to the fact that we neglected the variation of the pairing potential over a unit cell . in reality , the order parameter should be lower in magnitude near the vortex cores because these regions are where superconductivity is beginning to break down .",
    "this means that we expect our calculated line shapes to be more accurate in the lower internal field regions than in the high internal field regions .",
    "finally , we note that the peak in our curve at @xmath118 is split in two , as opposed to the single peak seen in the experimental data@xcite .",
    "this suggests that there is another broadening mechanism at work besides that due to the finite width of the normal - state line shape because such broadening can wash out the `` split '' peak so that only a single peak appears .",
    "one such possibility is the presence of impurities .",
    "we are able to obtain good fits of our calculated temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rates to the experimental data using the internal magnetic field as our _ only _ fitting parameter .",
    "we note , however , that the values of the internal magnetic fields giving us our best - fit curves on the line shape do not quite match the experimental results . in the experiment ,",
    "the region away from the core was in the vicinity of the peak in the line shape@xcite .",
    "however , the positions of the corresponding theoretical curves do not quite fall on the peak ; rather , they are away from it .",
    "it is possible that this discrepancy may be due , in part , to our approximations in solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation , and that more realistic modeling of the vortex core is necessary to account for this .",
    "we wish to thank profs .",
    "mitrovi , kivelson , chakravarty and teanovi for discussion .",
    "ov would also like to thank the aspen center for physics , where part of this work was completed , for hospitality .",
    "here , we go into some more detail about how we found the different terms in the spin - lattice relaxation rate .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , when we rewrite the spin raising and lowering operators in terms of the bogoliubov quasiparticles , we obtain 16 terms , though only 6 give non - zero contributions .",
    "one term we find that contributes to the sf process , suppressing factors of @xmath247 and @xmath248 that occur , is @xmath249 we note that the only terms that will give non - zero contributions are those for which @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 .",
    "we may then write @xmath254 we now note that the only non - zero matrix elements will be those in which the state @xmath255 is obtained from the state @xmath256 by scattering a particle from the state with crystal wave vector @xmath257 , band index @xmath258 , and spin up into the state with wave vector @xmath229 , band index @xmath34 , and spin down .",
    "this means that the energy difference between the two states is just @xmath259 .",
    "this energy difference is independent of the exact many - particle states @xmath256 and @xmath255 , so we may rewrite the sum on these states as a trace : @xmath260 we may now employ the anticommutation relations among the quasiparticle operators to rewrite the above in terms of number operators : @xmath261 upon taking the thermal average , the trace becomes a product of fermi functions : @xmath262 we will also show the calculation for the term resulting from the pair creation and annihilation term because it will differ slightly from the calculation given above .",
    "this term ( again suppressing actors of @xmath247 and @xmath248 ) is @xmath263 in this case , there are two ways to `` match '' the operators ; we may either let @xmath264 and @xmath265 or let @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath268 the only non - zero matrix elements in this case are those in which the state @xmath255 is obtained from the state @xmath256 by destroying two quasiparticles with spin up , one with wave vector @xmath229 and band index @xmath34 and one ith wave vector @xmath257 and band index @xmath258 .",
    "this means that the energy difference @xmath269 .",
    "the rest of the derivation proceeds as before , and we eventually obtain @xmath270    99 r.e . walstedt _ the nmr probe of high - tc materials by walstedt _ , ( springer - verlag new york , 2008 ) .",
