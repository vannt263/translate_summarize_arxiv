    "<S> this work provides insights into the multiple topological scales of complex networks , and the obtained community structure can naturally reflect the diffusion capability of the underlying network .    as two main focuses of the study of complex networks , the community structure and the dynamics on networks </S>",
    "<S> have both attracted much attention in various scientific fields . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , many methods for community detection have been proposed and applied successfully to some specific complex networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each method requires , explicitly or implicitly , a definition of a community from different perspectives , such as the centrality measures , link density , percolation theory , and network compression . generally , community structure is known as the existence of groups of nodes such that nodes within a group are much more connected to each other than to the rest of the network  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . community structure may provide insight into the relation between the structure and the function of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> taking the world wide web as an example , closely hyperlinked web pages form a community and they often concern related topics  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a well known definition for a community is via the modularity , which is proposed by newman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ as a quality function for a partition of the network . </S>",
    "<S> modularity is effective for detecting the community structure of many real world networks . </S>",
    "<S> however , as pointed out by fortunato _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , modularity suffers the resolution limit problem and this problem raises concerns about the reliability of the communities detected through the optimization of modularity . in  @xcite , the authors claimed that the resolution limit problem is attributable to the coexistence of multiple scale descriptions of the topological structure of the network , while only one scale is obtained through directly optimizing the modularity . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the definition of modularity only considers the significance of link density from the static topological structure of network , and it is unclear how the modularity based community structure is correlated to the dynamics on network .    on the other hand , many efforts are devoted to understanding the properties of the dynamical processes taking place on the underlying networks  @xcite . in recent years , researchers have begun to investigate the correlation between the community structure and the dynamics on networks . </S>",
    "<S> for example , arenas _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ pointed out that the synchronization reveals the topological scale in complex networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the random walk on a network was also extensively studied and used to uncover community structure of the network  @xcite . in  @xcite , the random walk on a network is introduced for defining the distance between network nodes , and an algorithm based on this distance is proposed for partitioning the network into communities . in  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors proposed quantifying and ranking the quality of network partitions in terms of their stability , defined as the clustered autocovariance in the random walk process taking place on the network .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper , through investigating the diffusion process taking place on the network , we note that local equilibrium states appear before the diffusion process reaches the final equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of local equilibrium states can be measured by their duration time in the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> then , we demonstrate that the intrinsic community structure is revealed by the stable local equilibrium states of the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that such community structure can be directly identified through the optimization of the conductance of the network , which measures how easily the diffusion among different communities occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> we first introduce some notations used later . an undirected network @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes </S>",
    "<S> is often described in terms of its adjacency matrix @xmath2 whose elements @xmath3 denote the strength of the link connecting the nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of node @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath6 . for a node set @xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath8 denotes the number of node in @xmath9 , the volume of @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is referred to as the inward volume of @xmath9 .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with investigating the diffusion process which describes the dynamics of a random walker moving on the network . at each time @xmath12 , the random walker moves from its current node @xmath4 to one of its neighboring nodes @xmath5 randomly with the probability @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of this process can be described as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the probability that the random walker resides at the node @xmath4 at the time @xmath12 , and @xmath16 is a parameter controlling the rate of the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath17 is the normalized laplacian matrix defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the identity matrix and @xmath20 is a diagonal matrix with its diagonal elements @xmath21 .    for any starting node , as time proceeds , </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion process described in the equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) will definitely move towards equilibrium if the underlying undirected network is connected and non - bipartite  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the diffusion process is at the equilibrium state , it satisfies the so - called _ detailed balance condition _  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the probability that the random walker walks through the nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 successively is equal to the probability that the random walker walks through the nodes @xmath5 and @xmath4 successively . formally , the detailed balance condition can be denoted by @xmath22 and the reduced form is @xmath23 for undirected networks .    </S>",
    "<S> we explore the transients in the whole diffusion process instead of only the final equilibrium state . during the diffusion process on a network </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that the detailed balance condition is satisfied among highly interconnected nodes first and then , sequentially , among less interconnected ones , until among all the nodes . in order to evaluate how closely two nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 satisfy the detailed balance condition at the time @xmath12 , we introduce a measure @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 averages over different realizations of the diffusion process with randomly selected starting nodes . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> a pair of nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 is said to satisfy the detailed balance condition at the time @xmath12 when @xmath24 is smaller than a given threshold . </S>",
    "<S> a set @xmath27 of nodes is said to satisfy the detailed balance condition if the average value @xmath28 of @xmath24 for each node @xmath4 is smaller than the given threshold . </S>",
    "<S> relative to the final equilibrium state , we say that the diffusion process is at a local equilibrium state when only several groups of nodes locally satisfy the detailed balance condition . using the matrix @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> , we can trace the different local equilibrium states during the diffusion process .    </S>",
    "<S> ccc    cc +    as an example , we use @xmath24 to analyze the diffusion process on the h13 - 4 network , which is constructed according to  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the network has two predefined hierarchical levels , the first hierarchical level consists of @xmath29 groups of @xmath30 nodes and the second hierarchical level consists of @xmath31 groups of @xmath31 nodes . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates the @xmath24 of two transients corresponding to two different local equilibrium states of the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the squares along the diagonal suggest that the corresponding groups of nodes satisfy the detailed balance condition . </S>",
    "<S> these node groups reveal the predefined hierarchical levels in the h13 - 4 network . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the diffusion dynamics on the randomized h13 - 4 network , which is constructed through shuffling the edges of the h13 - 4 network used in figure  [ fig1 ] . from figure  [ fig2](a ) </S>",
    "<S> , we can see that there is no node group locally satisfying the detailed balance .     of a transient in the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> each value of @xmath24 is the average over @xmath32 realizations of the diffusion process with randomly selected starting nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the number of node groups satisfying the detailed balance condition as a function of time @xmath12 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the threshold for @xmath24 is set to be @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=32.0% ]   of a transient in the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> each value of @xmath24 is the average over @xmath32 realizations of the diffusion process with randomly selected starting nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the number of node groups satisfying the detailed balance condition as a function of time @xmath12 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the threshold for @xmath24 is set to be @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=25.0% ] +    a phenomenon similar to that illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] has also been observed in the synchronization process . in  @xcite , the authors claimed that this phenomenon reveals the topological scale of networks . </S>",
    "<S> the authors also pointed out that the phenomenon of the synchronization process is correlated with the spectrum of the laplacian matrix associated with the underlying network . according to the characteristics of the laplacian matrix , </S>",
    "<S> as pointed out in  @xcite , the community structure revealed by the synchronization process is heavily affected by the heterogeneous degree distribution and the community size distribution . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the local equilibrium state phenomenon is correlated with the spectrum of the normalized laplacian matrix , which takes the heterogeneous degree and community size distribution into account and thus behaves better than the laplacian matrix as regards clustering the nodes of network  @xcite .    in this paper , a local equilibrium state </S>",
    "<S> is regarded as stable if the set of node groups satisfying the detailed balance condition remains unchanged for a long duration in the diffusion process . to investigate the stability of the local equilibrium states , </S>",
    "<S> we study the solution of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) in terms of the normal modes @xmath35 , which reads @xmath36 where the @xmath37 are the eigenvalues of the transpose of the normalized laplacian matrix @xmath17 , and @xmath38 is the eigenvector matrix whose @xmath39th column is the eigenvector @xmath40 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath37 . given the starting node of the diffusion process , the initial amplitudes @xmath41 can be determined according to equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) due to the eigenvector matrix @xmath38 being fixed , i.e. , @xmath41 only depends on the starting node of the diffusion process . note that , as pointed out following the equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) , we investigate the average behavior of many different diffusion processes with randomly selected starting nodes . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the choice of the starting nodes does not affect the results of the following analysis in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> without loss of generality , we rank these eigenvalues in the ascending order @xmath42@xmath43@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 @xmath47 .    as </S>",
    "<S> time proceeds in the diffusion process , these normal modes @xmath48 will decay to zero . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath49 to denote the time when the normal mode @xmath35 decays to zero . </S>",
    "<S> formally , @xmath49 is infinite . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , a threshold @xmath50 is usually used to determine when @xmath35 decays to zero , i.e. , @xmath51 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath52 all these moments @xmath49 ( @xmath53 ) form a series of time intervals , respectively @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 . these time intervals divide the whole diffusion process into @xmath1 stages . specifically , the time interval @xmath57 is regarded as the @xmath39th stage . </S>",
    "<S> when the diffusion process is at the @xmath39th stage , only the normal modes @xmath60(@xmath61 ) have not decayed to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath62 this indicates that the value @xmath15 of node @xmath4 at the @xmath39th stage can be represented by the @xmath39-dimension coefficient vector of @xmath60 , i.e. , @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> according to equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , given a threshold , we can identify the node groups satisfying the detailed balance condition through clustering the normalized @xmath39-dimension vectors of @xmath64 using , for example , the @xmath65-means clustering method . </S>",
    "<S> the set of such node groups is unchanged due to the non - decayed normal modes being fixed during the same stage . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the local equilibrium state is stable if the corresponding stage persists for a long time .    </S>",
    "<S> ccc    cc +    taking the h13 - 4 network as an example , the left panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows the different local equilibrium states of the diffusion process and the right panel illustrates the different stages in terms of the number of non - decayed normal modes of the diffusion process . through comparing the two panels </S>",
    "<S> , we see that each time one normal mode decays to zero , the diffusion process changes from a local equilibrium state to a new one . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that two stable local equilibrium states with long durations emerge in the diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the node groups corresponding to these two states clearly reveal the intrinsic community structure of the h13 - 4 network . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from figure  [ fig2](b ) , we can see that no stable local equilibrium state appears in the diffusion process taking place on the randomized h13 - 4 network . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable , as it is commonly believed that randomized network have no community structure . </S>",
    "<S> all these findings suggest that the appearance of stable local equilibrium states in a diffusion process indicates the existence of community structure in the underlying network .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the diffusion occurs much more frequently within the node groups than among them when the diffusion process is at a stable local equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that there exists a high transitive cohesion inside such node groups . </S>",
    "<S> the community structure comprised of these node groups could well reflect the diffusion dynamics on the underlying network . </S>",
    "<S> regarding such community structure as a partition of a network , we measure the quality of the partition through introducing the _ conductance _ of networks , which reflects how easily the diffusion occurs among different communities .    for a given partition @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> , the conductance is defined as the average _ departure probability _ , @xmath67 , of all the communities @xmath68 , that is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the departure probability of a community @xmath68 is the probability that the random walker departs from @xmath68 in the next time step given that it resides at @xmath68 when the diffusion process is at the final equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> formally , the departure probability of @xmath68 can be computed by using @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the stationary distribution which characterizes the final equilibrium state of the diffusion process . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> the conductance is formally denoted by @xmath72    actually , it can be proved that the community structure associated with the stable local equilibrium state can be exactly identified through minimizing the conductance directly . without loss of generality , we assume that the stable local equilibrium state emerges at the @xmath65th stage in the diffusion process . as mentioned above , the community structure associated with this state can be identified through clustering the normalized @xmath65-dimension vectors of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> further , through the matrix trace maximization method  @xcite , it can be proved that the optimization of the conductance for a fixed @xmath65 can be done through clustering the top @xmath65 eigenvectors of the transpose of the normalized laplacian matrix , corresponding to the @xmath74st to @xmath65th columns of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the optimization of conductance provides an effective way to identify the community structure associated with the stable local equilibrium state .    </S>",
    "<S> now we clarify the difference between the conductance used in this paper and the earlier measure for the quality of network partition from the perspective of a random walk on networks . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , as pointed out in  @xcite , as a measure of the quality of network partition , the modularity can be described as the difference between the probability that a random walker resides in the same community on two successive time steps and the probability that two independent random walkers both resides in the same community . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , in  @xcite , through considering the random path with length @xmath12 instead of the length @xmath74 for the modularity and the length of infinity for the spectral partition , the authors proposed that the stability of network partitions be defined as the clustered autocovariance of the random walk . </S>",
    "<S> this stability provides a general framework for quantifying and ranking the quality of network partitions from the perspective of the whole network , i.e. , it characterizes the fraction of the within - community random paths with length @xmath12 with respect to all the random paths of length @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the conductance considers the quality of network partition from the perspective of each community instead of the whole network , i.e. , it reflects the fraction of within - community random paths with respect to all the random paths departing solely from the community considered . </S>",
    "<S> this provides the advantage for handling the heterogeneous distribution of community size ( or volume ) which is common to real world networks . </S>",
    "<S> as follows , the application of the conductance optimization method to the benchmarks of lancichinetti et al also demonstrates that our method can effectively handle the heterogeneous distribution of community size .    to test the effectiveness of our method for community detection based on the optimization of conductance </S>",
    "<S> , we utilize the benchmark proposed by lancichinetti et al in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this benchmark provides networks with heterogeneous distributions of node degree and community size . </S>",
    "<S> thus it poses a much more severe test of community detection algorithms than standard benchmarks . </S>",
    "<S> many parameters are used to control the generated networks in this benchmark : the number of nodes @xmath1 , the average node degree @xmath75 , the maximum node degree max@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}k$ ] , the mixing ratio @xmath77 , the exponent of the power law node degree distribution @xmath78 , the exponent of the power law distribution of community size @xmath79 , the minimum community size min@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}c$ ] , and the maximum community size max@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}c$ ] . in our tests , we use the default parameter configuration where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , max@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}k=50 $ ] , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , min@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}c=20 $ ] , and max@xmath76{0.15cm}{0.3pt}c=50 $ ] . by tuning the parameter @xmath77 , we test the effectiveness of our method on the networks with different fuzziness of communities . </S>",
    "<S> the larger the parameter @xmath77 , the fuzzier the community structure of the generated network . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we adopt the normalized mutual information ( nmi )  @xcite in order to compare the partition found by the algorithms with the answer partition . the larger the nmi , the more effective the tested algorithm .    = @xmath84 and the number of communities is @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> ( c)comparison between the conductance optimization method and the modularity optimization method on benchmark networks . </S>",
    "<S> each point corresponds to an average over @xmath86 network realizations.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ] = @xmath84 and the number of communities is @xmath85 . </S>",

    "<S> the squares along the diagonal indicate the predefined communities in the network . </S>",
    "<S> the number of these communities is clearly revealed by the most stable local equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig4](c ) shows the comparison between the conductance optimization method and the modularity optimization method in terms of the nmi on the benchmark network . </S>",
    "<S> when the community structure is evident , both our method and the modularity optimization method ( e.g. , the fast unfolding algorithm  @xcite and the spectral method  @xcite ) can accurately identify the community structure . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the community structure becomes fuzzier , the performance of the modularity optimization method deteriorates while our method still achieves rather good results .    </S>",

    "<S> two most stable equilibrium states are marked with ( i ) and ( ii).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ] +    in addition , we also tested the conductance optimization method on many real world networks which are widely used to evaluate community detection methods . </S>",
    "<S> these networks include the social network of zachary s karate club , the social network of dolphins of lusseau _ et al _ , the college football network of the united states  @xcite , the journal index network constructed in  @xcite , and the network of political books  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for all these networks , the conductance optimization method obtains extremely good results . </S>",
    "<S> taking zachary s network as an example , figure  [ fig5](b ) illustrates the different stages of the diffusion process taking place on the network . </S>",
    "<S> the two most stable local equilibrium states are marked ( i ) and ( ii ) , and the corresponding communities are depicted in figure  [ fig5](a ) . besides the stages ( i ) and ( ii ) , another relatively stable state can be also observed during the diffusion process , as shown in figure  [ fig5](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding three communities are respectively the one comprised of all the circle nodes and two communities formed by the square nodes but with different colors , as shown in figure  [ fig5](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> actually , as regards the three stable states , it is really hard to say which the best one is . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , the duration time of each state may provide an effective candidate measure for the significance of network divisions .    in summary , we find that several stable local equilibrium states emerge during the diffusion process on networks with community structure . </S>",
    "<S> these stable states reveal the intrinsic community structure of the underlying networks . </S>",
    "<S> we further propose a conductance optimization method to identify the community structure , which naturally reflects the diffusion capability of the network . </S>",
    "<S> this work provides new insights into the number of communities and the multiple topological scales of complex network . as future work </S>",
    "<S> , we will study the relation and difference between the conductance and the modularity method . </S>"
