    "liquid water is arguably one of the most important liquids due to its role in chemistry , biology and geophysics and , as such , also one of the most studied systems.@xcite despite this , a detailed understanding of the physical chemistry of water is still lacking due to its complex behaviour and unusual properties.@xcite however , computational studies of water are rather challenging due to the presence of the various physical phenomena that conspire to make water unique , such as the cooperativity of the hydrogen bond ( hb ) network , large polarizability effects , strong permanent dipoles and sizeable nuclear quantum effects ( nqe ) .",
    "@xcite    the role of zero - point energy ( zpe ) and tunnelling effects in modifying the strength of interactions in the hb network of ambient liquid water , and the consequences for the static and dynamic properties , has been appreciated for almost three decades now.@xcite although it is well known that nqe generally weaken intermolecular hydrogen - bonding , resulting in a less - structured liquid and concomitantly faster rotational and translational dynamics , @xcite there is ongoing debate regarding the magnitude of this effect .",
    "for example , while comparisons of classical and quantum ( path integral ) simulations of liquid water using empirical force - fields generally predict that the rates of dynamic processes are increased by around 50% due to nqe,@xcite recent simulations using a water model specifically parameterized for quantum simulations suggests an enhancement of just 15% .",
    "@xcite    an _ ab initio _",
    "pimd approach , where the interatomic forces are calculated on - the - fly from accurate electronic structure calculations , would be very attractive to address the questions surrounding the role of nqe in liquid water .",
    "considerable effort has gone into devising practical density functional theory ( dft ) based pimd methods @xcite and much progress has been reported.@xcite nevertheless , the computational expense of this route still severely limits the length- and time - scales that can be studied .    in this work ,",
    "we take a different route . to circumvent the computational cost associated with an _ ab initio _ pimd technique , we instead develop here a flexible water models which are derived by matching the interatomic forces to those from accurate electronic structure calculations,@xcite without relying on any empirical parameters or experimental input .",
    "this not only facilitates large - scale pimd simulations with an accuracy that is similar to dft - based pimd calculations , but at variance to empirical force - fields that are parameterized to reproduce experimental data , is also not plagued by adouble - counting \" of nqe.@xcite furthermore , this allows us to assess the accuracy and intrinsic properties of potential dft - based pimd simulations as distinct from those that arise from numerical approximations , insufficient sampling and finite - size effects .",
    "however , contrary to explicit electronic structure - based pimd simulations , the employed functional form of the recently devised q - tip4p / f force - field entails that the resulting water model is neither polarizable nor able to simulate chemical reactions that may take place in water.@xcite    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  ii , we present the force - matching scheme used to derive the parameters of new flexible q - tip4p / f - like water models .",
    "the finite temperature path - integral methods used to rigorously account for zpe and tunnelling effects , and to investigate the influence of nqe in liquid water are described in section  iii .",
    "thereafter , in section  iv , we describe computational details , and in section  v we assess the accuracy of water models derived using the force - matching procedure .",
    "the eventual performance of our newly derived water models and the influence of nqe are discussed in section  v , which is followed by conclusions in section  vi .",
    "empirical water force - fields are typically parameterized so as to reproduce experimental data such as the radial distribution function ( rdf ) , structure factor , heat of vaporization and the density maximum of liquid water.@xcite while these potentials are usually remarkably accurate in reproducing the underlying experiments , the transferability to regions of the phase diagram or situations different from that in which they have been fitted may be restricted .",
    "furthermore , since nqe are already present in experiment , they will be considered twofold when taken explicitly into account within a pimd simulation.@xcite    using results from accurate _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations where , contrary to experimental data , nqe are not present , this `` double - counting '' of nqe is circumvented from the outset and permits to study the impact of nqe in a direct and systematic manner . beside the finite - difference approach",
    "@xcite there are many schemes to fit empirical models to _ ab initio _ data , including the inverse monte carlo @xcite or iterative boltzmann inversion @xcite technique that both rely on henderson s theorem , which states that a potential with only pairwise interactions is uniquely determined by the rdf up to an additive constant.@xcite however , the application of henderson s theorem is not without problems since at finite numerical accuracy essentially indistinguishable rdfs may entail very different pair potentials.@xcite furthermore , the generation of reference rdfs from first - principles by _ ab initio _ md ( aimd ) simulations is computationally rather time consuming , @xcite in particular when considering many state points to guarantee that the resulting water model is as transferable as possible .",
    "in contrast , the force - matching technique of ercolessi and adams,@xcite where the interaction potential is derived so as to mimic the forces of accurate reference calculations , not only includes many - body environmental effects , but also allows to employ a higher level of theory since fewer electronic structure calculations are required , in general . to determine the parameters of an empirical interaction potential given _ ab initio _ force calculations for a set of configurations , we minimize the normalized @xmath0 force distance @xmath1 , @xmath2 \\right >",

    "the minimization of eq .",
    "[ eq : chi ] with respect to the parameters of @xmath10 represents an ill - posed problem , in particular when including atomic partial charges in the optimization procedure . from this",
    "it follows that the optimization may not be stable under small variations of the corresponding parameters .",
    "this is reflected in an error landscape with many saddle points and flat areas , where the hessian matrix is nearly singular , which leads to inaccuracies due to the limited precision of floating point arithmetic . as a consequence ,",
    "an important problem of gradient - based minimization methods is the particular form of the objective function , whose derivative with respect to partial charges are often found to be ill - conditioned .    even though it is possible to mitigate this difficulty by augmenting the penalty function with additional properties such as the total force or torque with its respective weights,@xcite here we propose to circumvent this using the sequential least - squares quadratic programming algorithm ( slsqp ) together with physically - sensible bound constraints @xcite .",
    "the slsqp method treats the original problem as a sequence of constrained least - squares problems that is equivalent to a quadratic programming algorithm for nonlinearly - constrained gradient - based optimization , hence the name .",
    "specifically , each slsqp step involves solving a quadratic approximation of the original objective function , where the linear term is the gradient and the quadratic term is an approximate hessian , with first - order affine approximations of the nonlinear constraints .",
    "the approximate hessian , which is initialized to the identity matrix , is continuously updated , while keeping it positive definite , based on the gradients and function values at subsequent steps similar to the bfgs quasi - newton scheme.@xcite as a consequence , like any quasi - newton method , the true hessian is only approached in the limit of many iterations close to the minimum . as a result of the ill - posed nature of the problem , we search for the minimum along the direction of the modified quasi - newton scheme by first bracketing the minimum and then using brent s method.@xcite at variance to more elaborate techniques that exploit gradient information , here the availability of the function s derivative is not required .",
    "however , it should be noted that this procedure offers no guarantees about whether the global minimum of the optimization function is located .",
    "the aim of this work is to use the force matching procedure outlined above to fit simple empirical force - fields to _ ab initio _ force data ; this requires us to choose a functional form for the empirical water model , within which the parameters will be optimised . among the large number of simple point charge models that have been developed for liquid water",

    "these so - called m - sites and the hydrogen atoms on different water molecules interact with each other through a simple coulomb potential . in conjunction with a lennard - jones potential between the oxygen atoms ,",

    "the central aim is to modify the nine independent parameters of the original q - tip4p / f water model such that it reproduces the forces determined in _ ab initio _ calculations . in particular , we optimise these parameters for a series of different dft functionals , resulting in several different q - tip4p / f - like water models .",

    "finally , we note that time - independent quantum thermal properties of position - dependent operators can now be calculated straightforwardly in pimd simulations according to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is given as the bead - average of the operator @xmath44 , thus @xmath45 by comparing classical ( @xmath46 ) and pimd simulations , this approach allows one to assess the impact of nqe in time - independent observables such as rdfs .    in order to reduce the computational effort required to calculate the long - range electrostatic interactions @xmath25 times",

    "the effective masses of the ring - polymer beads are adjusted so as to shift the spurious oscillations beyond the spectral range of interest @xcite .",
    "specifically , the elements of the parrinello - rahman mass matrix are chosen so that the internal modes of the ring - polymer are shifted to a frequency of @xmath54 which allows for similar integration time - steps to be used in both rpmd and pacmd simulations.@xcite",
    "in attempting to generate empirical water models that are as transferable as possible , we have extracted 1500 decorrelated snapshots from pimd simulations consisting of 125 water molecules in the constant - npt ( isothermal , isobaric ) ensemble using the q - tip4p / f water potential of habershon _ et al .",

    "the relatively small quantum effect for q - tip4p / f was found to be due to the existence of a `` competition '' between intramolecular and intermolecular zpe contributions ; in particular , intermolecular hydrogen bonds are weakened by zpe , leading to faster translational dynamics , but the strength of intermolecular interactions is increased by changes to the molecular dipole moment which arise due to the incorporation of intramolecular zpe . in the present work @xmath88",

    "although difficult to confirm without further detailed investigations , it seems that a likely explanation is the fact that the intramolecular potential in the force - matched fm - tip4p / f - tpss - d3 potential derived here is much `` softer '' than the original q - tip4p / f model , as already noted above . as a result ,",
    "the addition of intramolecular zpe as one moves from classical simulation to one including nqe may have a larger impact on intermolecular forces than in the original q - tip4p / f model ; this effect , along with the overly - tetrahedral structure of the water model proposed here , may lead to the observation of an `` inverse '' quantum effect .",
    "given the experimental evidence from isotopically - substituted water , where normal water diffuses faster than heavy water ( d@xmath90o ) , this suggests that there remain some feature of our empirical models which fails to account correctly for the influence of quantum fluctuations ; investigating these features will be an aim of future work .",

    "moreover , the peak at @xmath99 is absent from both of the simulated spectra .",
    "this peak arises from the low - frequency modulation of dipole - induced dipole interactions which are clearly not present in simple point - charge models .",
    "@xcite however , the calculation including nqe shows the typical red - shift in comparison to the classical one , @xcite although we note that it remains unclear to what extent this is due to the well - known `` curvature problem '' observed by marx and coworkers . @xcite we find that , while the o - h stretching frequencies of the force - matched model reproduce the experimental values reasonably well , whereas the q - spc / fw water model predicts distinct antisymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks @xcite .",
    "however , the bending frequency is under - estimated by around @xmath100 ; again , this may be a simple consequence of the parameters determined in the force - matching procedure ; all of the force - fields derived here exhibit bending force constants @xmath101 which are smaller than that of the original q - tip4p / f model , which itself reproduces the experimental bending frequency quite accurately .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a series of q - tip4p / f - like water models using a force - matching algorithm based on reference forces from dft calculations .",
    "subsequent classical and quantum simulations of the resulting water models demonstrated a wide range of results depending upon which exchange - correlation functional was employed in the calculation of the reference forces used as input for the force - matching procedure ; however , some trends are apparent .",
    "almost all force - matched water models resulted in over - structured liquid water when compared to experimental results ; this finding is not uncommon in dft - based simulations , so it is not surprising that empirical models based on dft reference forces exhibit a similar propensity .",
    "overall , we found that the fm - tip4p / f - tpss - d3 model offered the best agreement with experimental properties , including the density maximum , temperature of maximum density , melting point , translational diffusion constant and the ir spectrum .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that none of the force - matched models developed here offered performance on par with the original q - tip4p / f water model ; this may point to an insufficient accuracy of the dft reference forces , but we must also bear in mind that the q - tip4p / f force - field was designed to specifically reproduce experimental properties in quantum simulations , rather than being derived from _ ab initio _ reference forces .    despite this",
    ", there are many improvements which could be made to build on the present study . for example , the q - tip4p / f - like models developed here clearly neglect polarisability , an effect which could be easily incorporated into the current force - matching scheme .",
