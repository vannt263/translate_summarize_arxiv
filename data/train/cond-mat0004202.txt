    "the optical properties of mixed polar crystals have been attracting a great deal of interest since the 1950 s .",
    "main efforts have been directed to experimental and theoretical studies of the concentration dependencies of fundamental transverse ( to ) and longitudinal ( lo ) phonon modes , and to the fine structure of spectra in the frequency region between them ( _ restrahlen _ band ) .",
    "reviews of earlier experimental and theoretical works in this area can be found in refs .. in spite of the disordered nature of mixed crystals , it is usually possible to observe both to and lo modes of pure crystals at both ends of the concentration range , as well as features associated with disorder.@xcite this is usually done in reflectance or transmittance experiments by identifying the maxima of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with to and lo modes respectively , where @xmath2 is the dielectric function.@xcite    the term mixed crystals is usually applied to materials in which the concentration of each component is large , so that no component can be considered as a system of independent impurities . at smaller concentrations the dynamics of impure systems is described in terms of defect states , which are either localized or quasilocalized depending on whether they fall into forbidden or allowed bands@xcite of the pure system .",
    "the transition from low to high concentration behavior occurs when the average distance between defects becomes of the same order as the localization length of the individual states . in the case of the local phonon states ,",
    "the localization length is of the order of a few lattice constants , and the respective transition concentration is of the order of @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "most of the studies of mixed crystals were focused upon combinations of alkali halides , ii / iv and iii / v group polar binary crystals @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is concentration .",
    "the @xmath7 atoms are substituted with the atoms @xmath8 from the same column of the periodic table .",
    "it was found that there were several patterns that to and lo modes follow in mixed crystals.@xcite in the type i mixed crystals , also called one - mode crystals , the frequencies of the to and lo modes evolve smoothly and almost linearly with the composition parameter @xmath6 from their values in @xmath9 to those in @xmath10 . in some one - mode systems ( e.g. , @xmath11 , @xmath12@xcite ) an additional pair of weak modes inside the absorption band is observed .",
    "type ii or two - mode mixed crystals exhibit qualitatively different behavior .",
    "two distinct restrahlen bands are usually observed in the crystals of this category . for arbitrary concentration ,",
    "the width of each of these bands , @xmath13 , is approximately proportional to the composition parameter @xmath6 for the dopant related band , and to @xmath14 for that of the original material .",
    "two - mode behavior is characteristic for the crystals formed by elements from iii and v groups of the periodic table ( e.g. @xmath15 and the like ) .",
    "another mode behavior could not be fit experimentally either to one- or to two - mode patterns ( e.g. @xmath16,@xcite , @xmath17,@xcite @xmath18,@xcite _ etc .",
    "this group of mixed crystals was called type i - ii or one - two - mode systems . in these systems",
    ", one mode behaves as in type i , while the other behaves as in type ii , which is why type i - ii is also called mixed mode .    to explain different types of behavior in mixed polar crystals ,",
    "a number of theoretical models have been proposed . in the ir experiments , modes with wave numbers @xmath19",
    "are excited . the random element isodispacement model ( rei)@xcite takes advantage of this fact , assuming that the sublattices vibrate in phase with @xmath20 . with some modifications@xcite after including the local field , and assuming a dependence of the force constants upon the composition , the modified rei model ( mrei ) was successfully used to fit two - mode crystals but encountered some problems in the one - mode materials .",
    "the fine structure of some mixed crystals was reproduced along the lines of rei by means of a considerable increase in the number of fitting parameters ( cluster model@xcite ) .",
    "a different approach made use of the green s function formalism in order to treat vibrations in the mixed crystals ; averaging over disorder was performed either in a simple virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) or with the use of the much more elaborate coherent potential approximation@xcite ( cpa ) .",
    "interaction with the electromagnetic field in these approaches was included after the averaging procedure was performed .",
    "the mean field approximation treats the crystal as if it has atoms of the same sort with some average properties .",
    "it reproduces well the one - mode behavior , but could not possibly explain the two - mode systems .",
    "cpa combined with an electrostatic treatment of the electric field was used to fit a broader range of experimental data ( see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "an important theoretical problem many researchers have focused upon is to find a simple criterion for different mode behavior , based upon dynamical properties of the crystals .",
    "lucovsky@xcite originally considered the significance of whether the original absorption bands overlap or not , which turned out to be a rather rough criterion . harada and narita@xcite proposed a criterion based on relations between mrei constants ( see also review papers in refs . ) .",
    "it turned out that one - mode and two - mode crystals can be described using quite simple models with only a few fitting parameter , such as vca and mrei , respectively .",
    "made an attempt to establish a connection between the behavior of a mixed crystal and the existence of the localized modes at small values of concentration parameters @xmath6 or @xmath14 .",
    "it was suggested that the two - mode behavior is associated with the existence of local impurity states at both ends of the concentration range , while the one - mode regime occurs when such local states do not arise .",
    "these ideas , however , could not be applied to the mixed - mode behavior since the local phonon states arise either in the gap between acoustic and optic branches or above the optic branch of the phonon spectrum.@xcite therefore , the mixed - mode crystals required much more elaborate models , where agreement with experimental data can only be achieved by increasing the number of fitting parameters .",
    "the same was true for weak features of spectra of the one - mode crystals .",
    "one of the goals of the present paper is to put forward a simple physical picture explaining the mixed - mode behavior based upon the concept of local polaritons and an impurity - induced polariton band .",
    "the local polariton is a state that arises due to an impurity with frequencies inside the _ restrahlen _ band of a crystal .",
    "these states have an electromagnetic component which is localized around the defect , because it can not propagate in the region with a negative dielectric parameter .",
    "a local polariton state within the _ restrahlen _ region was first observed experimentally in ref . as a weak feature in reflectance and raman spectra of @xmath21",
    "doped with @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "these states were found to be associated with the local change in susceptibility due to localization of an electron around the dopant .",
    "an interaction between the localized electron and lo vibrations of the crystal gives rise to local lo phonons , therefore these local states have a complicated structure that involves interactions between electrons , phonons and electromagnetic field .",
    "theoretically these states , however , were only considered in the electrostatic approximation,@xcite and therefore these early observations did not lead to the concept of local polaritons , which requires that the retardation be taken into account .",
    "a new wave of interest in the optical properties of impure crystals in the _ restrahlen _ region occured recently and was due to a general interest in systems with depleted or altered electromagnetic density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the primary examples of such systems are photonic crystals,@xcite and microcavities.@xcite the _ restrahlen _ region in polar crystals was considered from this new perspective independently in refs . , where the concept of local polaritons was introduced .",
    "the local state considered in ref . arises due to an impurity atom with optically active electronic transitions , which interacts with host atoms through the electromagnetic field only . with the transition frequency inside the _ restrahlen _ band ,",
    "this atom forms a local atom - radiation bound state . to some extent",
    "these states are similar to the ones observed by dean _ et al._,@xcite though an interaction with phonons was left out in ref .. a different type of local polariton was considered in refs .",
    ", where it was shown that regular isotopic impurities can give rise to local states with frequencies inside the _ restrahlen _ region .",
    "the interaction with the retarded electromagnetic field is responsible for the localized electromagnetic component of the states .",
    "the detailed analysis of the local polariton mode in a three dimensional sodium - chloride - like structure ( bcc ) crystal in the case of diagonal and off - diagonal disorder was carried out in ref . .",
    "it was proven that , because of retardation effects , a local polariton mode splits off the bottom of the to - lo gap for an arbitrarily small strength of the defects even in three dimensional systems .    when considering local polaritons , the authors of refs .",
    "assumed that the _ restrahlen _ is a spectral gap not only for electromagnetic excitations but for phonons as well .",
    "this is indeed the case for some polar crystals .",
    "it occurs more frequently , however , that the _ restrahlen _ region is devoid of transverse optic phonons , but is still filled with lo modes . in this case",
    "the interaction between local polaritons and lo phonons would make the former quasi - stationary . whether the local polaritons survive this interaction depends upon their life - time , and we shall address this question in the present paper . at the same time it is useful to note that the states observed in ref .",
    "reside in the frequency region where the density of lo modes is especially large .",
    "the fact that they remained observable allows for optimism that the local polariton states of refs . could also survive provided that dos of lo is not too large .",
    "if this is the case , then local polaritons due to isotopic impurities can be invoked to explain the mixed - mode behavior of mixed crystals and weak features in the one - mode systems without having to introduce tens of fitting parameters .",
    "these ideas can , for example , be used to discuss the one - two - mode mixed crystal @xmath24 .",
    "pure @xmath25 has a complete polariton gap in all directions , and experiments of ref",
    ". clearly demonstrated the polariton band associated with @xmath26 atoms inside the _ restrahl _ of @xmath25 even at room temperature .",
    "polariton branches inside _ restrahlen _ were also observed in pure @xmath27.@xcite this material demonstrates a very peculiar behavior because @xmath28 atoms can occupy several non - equivalent positions , thereby producing defects even in a pure material.@xcite these defects were shown to be responsible for a new to mode with a frequency in the main _ restrahlen_.@xcite these experiments were originally described using a phenomenological two - oscillator model , but they perfectly fit to the idea of local polariton sates .",
    "local polaritons , however , can take us further than an explanation of the old reflectivity experiments .",
    "when retardation is taken into account , the local polaritons give rise to a new transmitting channel for electromagnetic excitations , via impurity - induced polariton band .",
    "experimentally , such a band can be observed in transmission steady - wave and time - resolved experiments . the majority of the old experiments mentioned above dealt with reflection spectra .",
    "dips in the reflection coefficient in those experiments were associated with impurity - induced absorption , while they could have actually occured because of enhanced transmission via the impurity - induced polariton band .",
    "the effect of the enhanced transmission inside the _ restrahlen _ region of a polar crystal was observed in @xmath27.@xcite    we showed analytically that local polaritons give rise to a strong resonance enhancement of the transmittance at the frequency of the local mode,@xcite using a one - dimensional chain of dipoles . in the system without dissipation , the maximum value of the transmission coefficient reaches unity , although peak width depends exponentially upon the size of the system .",
    "numerical simulations for a finite concentration of impurities showed that a localized mode develops into a conduction band inside the original polariton gap.@xcite the growth of the local state into a conduction band in the system of optically active defects was also demonstrated in ref . .",
    "an analytical treatment of the impurity - induced polariton band in the dispersionless one dimensional dipole chain , with concentration of defects varying in the range @xmath29 was proposed in ref . .",
    "using the microcanonical method@xcite we were able to calculate dos due to the defect subsystem and the extinction ( localization ) length .",
    "we found that the impurity - induced band has a number of interesting properties .",
    "the group velocity of electromagnetic excitations , propagating in this band , for instance , was found to be proportional to the concentration of the impurities , and can be significantly smaller than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the results of analytical calculations were in agreement with numerical simulation in the presence of the spatial dispersion .",
    "the knowledge obtained from analytical dependencies of dos in the one - dimensional model gives us insight into a treatment of three dimensional mixed polar crystals .",
    "the spatial size of local polariton states may be as large as the em wavelength , meaning that even at a very low impurity concentration , @xmath30 @xmath4 , the local polaritons significantly overlap .",
    "this fact allows us to develop a continuous approximation for calculating properties of the polariton - induced band . applying this approximation to the one - dimensional case",
    ", we can use our previous one - dimensional results to test the suggested approach .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , the continuous approximation for the mixed crystals , based upon the concept of local polaritons , is introduced . in section iii",
    ", we estimate the life - time of the polariton local states due to interaction with lo modes . we show that under realistic assumptions about the density of states of lo modes , this life - time is compatible with that caused by inelastic relaxation , and may be long enough for local polaritons to survive . section iv deals with the properties of the impurity - induced polariton band ( dispersion laws and density of states of the respective excitations are studied ) .",
    "we also consider in this section the concentration dependence of poles and zeroes of the dielectric function , and a simple explanation of the mixed - mode and one - mode ( with weak structure ) behaviors is proposed .",
    "section v is devoted to investigation of the reflection and transmission spectra of the semi - infinite mixed crystals and a slab of finite width . in section",
    "vi we calculate scattering length of the impurity induced polaritons due to the fluctuations of concentration , and demonstrate why this scattering is significantly less important for impurity - induced polaritons then for regular polariton branches .",
    "this section provides an additional justification for the main results of the paper .",
    "in our recent work , ref . , we considered development of an impurity - induced polariton band in a one - dimensional model , and used the so - called microcanonical method@xcite in order to analytically calculate the complex lyapunov exponent of the system .",
    "the approximation used turned out to be in a very good agreement with numerical results , and was shown to be equivalent to a continuous medium approximation .",
    "the latter can easily be generalized for 3-d systems , and below we develop an approach to the impurity - induced polariton band in 3d mixed polar crystal using the following fundamental assumptions .    in order to model optic vibrations of the system under study , we introduce two subsystems of oscillators with different frequencies .",
    "one subsystem represents an optic mode of the host atoms .",
    "the interaction between this mode and light leads to the polariton gap between to and lo frequencies of the pure crystal .",
    "the second subsystem introduces vibrations of impurities , and it is assumed that its frequency belongs to the _ restrahlen _ of the host crystal .",
    "this is a crucial assumption of the model , since interaction between light and this mode brings about local polariton modes .",
    "the significance of this assumption rests upon two ideas .",
    "the first one goes back to lucovsky,@xcite who was the first to connect modes of mixed crystals with local impurity modes .",
    "the second one is the concept of local polaritons , which are local states with frequencies in the restrahlen of the host . in the one - dimensional case",
    "we have confirmed analytically and numerically@xcite that the presence of the local polaritons gives rise to an impurity polariton branch , when the concentration of impurities grows .",
    "the frequencies of both oscillators are , in general , complex - valued .",
    "the imaginary part of host vibrations is due to anharmonicity , while the impurity mode has two sources of decay . besides usual relaxation",
    ", local polaritons can acquire an additional imaginary part due to interaction with lo phonons which in some cases can fill the _",
    "restrahlen_. we will consider the contribution of this interaction into the life - time of local polaritons in the next section , and the general effects of relaxation upon reflection spectra of mixed crystals will be discussed in section v.    it was found in refs .",
    "that for all frequencies outside of the immediate vicinity of the to boundary of the _ restrahlen _ , the localization length @xmath31 of local polaritons is of the order of magnitude of the wavelength of the incident light @xmath32 . even for residual concentration @xmath33 of the impurities",
    ", @xmath34 is large .",
    "the individual states significantly overlap and a macroscopic volume containing many impurities can still be much smaller than the localization length .",
    "this fact allows us to develop a continuous medium approximation similar to the usual one used to treat long - wave excitations,@xcite but this time we use it to treat the sub - system of impurities .",
    "we would like to emphasize again that this consideration is reasonable for the polariton band only because of the long - range nature of the localized electromagnetic component of the local polaritons .",
    "the microscopical hamiltonian describing optic modes of our system is : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the reduced masses and relative displacements of the ions in pure @xmath9 and @xmath10 crystals , respectively .",
    "we will assume that the presence of atoms @xmath8 does not affect the order in the @xmath38 sublattice .",
    "the summation runs over spatial index @xmath39 for host atoms and over @xmath40 for the impurities .",
    "the third term in the above expression is the potential energy . in the harmonic approximation",

    "we shall assume that the concentration is such that @xmath49 .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , the individual defect states overlap , and the dynamical properties , apart from those at the fluctuation band - edge , do not depend significantly upon the particular arrangement of the defects in the crystal .",
    "hence , one can introduce a smoothing parameter @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "the macroscopic volume associated with this parameter is such that it contains macroscopically many impurities , but there are still no significant changes in spatial distribution of vibrations over this length : @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "taking advantage of this fact one can sum over the volume @xmath54 in the vicinity of @xmath55 in the hamiltonian ( [ h_separated ] ) : @xmath56 & \\rightarrow & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "another effect to be taken into account is that the local electric field on atoms that induces polarization is different from the macroscopic field entering the maxwell equations .",
    "the effective local field in a high symmetry crystal can be written in the form:@xcite @xmath68 substituting the effective local field into eq .",
    "( [ eq_motion ] ) and total polarization of the volume @xmath69 into eq .",

    "( [ eq_motion ] ) , ( [ maxwell ] ) , ( [ e_loc ] ) , and ( [ p_el ] ) formally resemble equations of mrei used in many papers .",
    "there are , however , important differences .",
    "first , the concentration parameter @xmath70 entering our equations is still a random function of coordinates .",
    "the statistics of this parameter , however , are significantly different from the original statistics of the microscopic distribution of impurities .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the continuous function @xmath70 reflects the fluctuations in the number of impurities in the macroscopic volume @xmath71 , which are significantly reduced as compared to the fluctuations in the original microscopic distribution of impure atoms .",
    "more detailed consideration of the statistical properties of @xmath70 will be presented in section vi .",
    "second , the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_motion ] ) , ( [ maxwell ] ) , ( [ e_loc ] ) , and ( [ p_el ] ) is explicitly based upon existence of a macroscopic length scale  the localization length of the local polaritons .",
    "a similar procedure can not be applied to the regular phonon states , because the localization length of the local phonon states is usually microscopic .",
    "finally , the requirements that the impurity - induced oscillator has its frequency within _ restrahlen _ replaces conditions for local phonon modes that appear in regular mrei.@xcite in this section we will assume that the fluctuation of the number of defects in the chosen volume is negligible and , therefore , @xmath72 . excluding the polarization and lattice displacements from the system yields the following equation for the fourier components of the electric field @xmath73 in this equation , @xmath74 denotes the effective dielectric function of the mixed polar crystal @xmath5 @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the lattice eigenfrequencies and parameters @xmath77 determine the width of the polariton gaps of the end crystals .",
    "we assume that the high frequency dielectric constant does not depend upon the concentration .",
    "@xmath78 can be expressed in terms of polarizability @xmath79 as @xmath80    from eq .",
    "( [ maxwell_final ] ) one can separate the transverse and longitudinal modes as @xmath81 a similar expression for the dielectric function was obtained previously in ref . within the mrei .",
    "nobody , however , assumed before that the @xmath82 lies within the _ restrahlen _ of the host .",
    "it is only the concept of local polaritons that justifies using this dielectric function in the case when the frequency of the defect oscillator falls into the polariton band gap .",
    "comparing eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) with the respective expression of our earlier work on the 1-d model ref .",
    ", one can see that eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) is a zero - order approximation in a series expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath83 . in section",
    "vi of the paper we shall demonstrate this fact implicitly .",
    "the model developed in the previous section is implicitly based upon the assumption about the existence of local states with frequencies within the _ restrahlen_. in this section we shall provide additional justifications for this assumption .    in the original papers@xcite where local polaritons were introduced , it was assumed that within the restrahlen there is a genuine spectral gap with the phonon dos being equal to zero over some frequency region .",
    "such situations are , indeed , possible in some crystals ( @xmath25 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , _",
    "etc_.@xcite ) . it is more common , however , that the _ restrahlen _ is filled with lo phonons , which are linearly coupled to local polaritons .",
    "this coupling results in the  phonon radiative decay \" of the local polaritons ( compare to radiative decay of local phonons due to coupling to light ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize , however , that the electromagnetic component of the local polaritons remains localized even when there is leakage through the phonon component .",
    "the phonon radiative decay broadening of local polaritons ( and the respective life - time ) is determined by the density of lo phonon states within the _ restrahlen_. in some cases this dos is large enough to suppress the local polaritons . at the same time",
    ", there exists a broad range of materials ( for instance , @xmath86,@xmath87 , @xmath88 , _",
    "etc_.@xcite ) that have a relatively low dos inside the _ restrahlen _ , so one could expect that local polaritons can survive the presence of lo phonons and affect significantly the transport properties of the system .",
    "in fact , the local states inside the _ restrahlen _ observed in ref . resided in the frequency region with a rather large dos , and still could be observed both in reflection and raman spectra .",
    "since the fundamental assumptions incorporated into the model presented in this paper are based upon existence of long - living local polaritons , it is of great importance to study their life - time in realistic polar crystals .",
    "our consideration of the question about the  phonon radiative decay \" time of the local polaritons is based upon results of ref .. it was shown that the frequency of the local polariton is determined by @xmath89 , \\label{eigenmodes_d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the masses of positive and negative ion sublattices respectively , @xmath93 is the difference between masses of the defect and the host atom replaced by the defect , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are densities of states of to and lo phonons , respectively . if the lo dos differs from zero in the _ restrahlen _ region where we expect the local state to reside , the respective integral in eq.([eigenmodes_d ] ) acquires an imaginary part equal to @xmath96 . for a light impurity ( @xmath97 ) this equation would have a real solution @xmath98 if @xmath99.podolsky the presence of lo modes makes the solution complex valued , @xmath100 .",
    "the phonon component becomes delocalized , although the electromagnetic component remains localized .",
    "if , as we assume , @xmath101 , then @xmath102 can be considered to be the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eigenmodes_d ] ) with the imaginary part dropped and @xmath103 can be found as the first order correction to it @xmath104 where @xmath105 is a principal value of the integral entering eq.([eigenmodes_d ] ) .",
    "the derivative of @xmath106 can be estimated using the explicit form of this function as @xmath107 .",
    "finally one obtains @xmath108 it follows from eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) that there are three factors affecting the life - time of the polariton states .",
    "first of all , it is the density of lo phonon states @xmath109 in the _ restrahlen_. as mentioned above , due to the strong dispersion of the lo branch , the density of states in many alkali halides@xcite between @xmath110 and @xmath111 can be less then @xmath112 of the maximum dos at to frequency . unfortunately , the experimental data on the phonon dos known to us do not provide its value in absolute units , and in order to obtain an estimate for this quantity in the region of interest , we have to rely upon some assumptions .",
    "to this end we use the debye model for dos of the _ acoustic _ phonons in order to establish a scale for the experimental results listed in ref . .",
    "this choice seems reasonable because the debye model gives a fairly good description of low - temperature thermodynamic properties of crystals , and parameters of the model for most of the crystal of interest are established with good accuracy . having the scale for the phonon dos",
    ", one can assess the numerical value of the dimensionless quantity @xmath109 .",
    "our estimates show that this parameter in the spectral region of interest can take values between @xmath113 and @xmath114 in different systems .",
    "the next factor affecting the life - time of the local polaritons is the defect parameter @xmath93 .",
    "this parameter can not be assumed to be too small since we would like to have our local state farther away from the to boundary of the _ restrahlen _ , and as it was shown in refs . , the frequency of the local polariton state moves deeper into the _ restrahlen _ with increase of the defect strength @xmath93 .",
    "at the same time , it is clear that the factor @xmath115 is at least less then unity .",
    "the third factor @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 when the negative atom is replaced ) , can be as small as @xmath113 for @xmath88 or even @xmath118 in the case of @xmath119 . combining all terms",
    "we find that in a number of crystals ( @xmath87 , @xmath120 , @xmath88 , _ etc _ , ) the dissipation of the local polariton state is rather small @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , it appears to be of the same order of magnitude as anharmonic absorption , and later in the paper we will introduce both these relaxation channels phenomenologically using just one parameter of relaxation .",
    "the presented estimates show that local polaritons can actually survive even in materials with _",
    "restrahlen _ filled with lo phonons , and provide , therefore , a foundation for the model presented in the previous section .",
    "now we can start discussing the results following from this model .",

    "_ phonon states , and contribute to the optical properties of the crystals . moreover , the presence of some local states within the _ restrahlen _ was confirmed experimentally in ref . , where neutral dopants ( @xmath285 ) give rise to the local electron - phonon state at the frequency slightly below lo of @xmath25 .",
    "what is interesting is that the region where these states reside , has a relatively high density of phonon states , which obviously did not preclude them from existence .",
    "all these arguments justify the use of local polaritons to describe properties of the _ restrahlen _ of mixed crystals .",
    "the second important property of local polaritons is that their spatial extent is of the order of optic wavelengths in the _ restrahl _ ( @xmath32 ) , which is much larger than the size of local phonons ( several interatomic distances ) .",
    "this fact means that even at residual concentrations of impurities , local polaritons overlap , forming a well developed band .",
    "we showed in this paper that this band can be described using the continuous medium approximation for the impurity subsystem . neglecting fluctuations of impurity concentration",
    ", we derived an effective dielectric function for our model , and used it to analyze the structure of optical spectra of mixed crystals .",
    "this dielectric function describes new impurity induced polariton bands , which arise inside the _ restrahlen _ of the host crystal .",
    "the first problem we set out to consider using the concept of impurity polaritons was weak features in the spectra of so called one - mode crystals @xmath11 , @xmath12,@xcite @xmath286 , @xmath287 , @xcite and the one - two - mode behavior of a different group of crystals @xmath288,@xcite @xmath17,@xcite @xmath18,@xcite @xmath289 , @xmath290 , @xmath291 , @xmath292,@xcite @xmath293 .",
    "the existing descriptions of these types of spectrum@xcite require a great number of fitting parameters .",
    "our model allowed us to explain these types of spectra naturally as manifestations of the impurity polariton mode , which reveals itself differently depending upon the relation between fundamental frequencies of crystals at both ends of the concentration range , and the frequency of the local polariton . introducing relaxation in a phenomenological way",
    ", we considered reflection and transmission spectra , and demonstrated that our model survives rather strong damping , and reproduces spectra closed to experimental observations . for rather thin samples our model predicts a resonant enhancement in the transmission at the frequency of the impurity polaritons , which accompanies an anti - resonance in reflection .",
    "the latter was observed in many papers,@xcite but was mostly attributed to the impurity induced absorption .",
    "the only transmission measurements known to us were performed on pure @xmath27,@xcite where transmission was found to exhibit the maximum similar to one predicted in our paper .",
    "@xmath27 is a peculiar material , since @xmath28 atoms at low temperature can occupy several non - equivalent positions , thereby creating internal defects.@xcite these off - center @xmath28 atoms can be responsible for the impurity polariton band , and therefore , transmission spectra of @xmath27 can be considered as the first evidence of this band .    since we took the retardation into account , we were able consider not only boundaries of the spectra but also dispersion laws , dos , and group velocities of the impurity induced polaritons .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of these excitations is that their group velocity is proportional to the concentration , and can be thousands of times smaller than the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the smallness of the group velocity makes dispersion curves of the excitation look almost flat .",
    "rather similar dispersion curves were measured experimentally in ref . in one - two - mode mixed crystal @xmath24 with the use of raman spectroscopy .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out additional steady state and time - resolved experiments in this material , which could verify predictions of our theory and provide more solid support for our concept of impurity - induced polaritons .",
    "our approach also allowed us to study scattering of impurity polaritons due to fluctuations of concentrations .",
    "we found that their scattering length is significantly different from the similar characteristics of regular polaritons of the host material .",
    "the scattering length of impurity polaritons is proportional to the concentration , making the scattering less efficient with an increase of concentration .",
    "quantitatively , the scattering length is very large , much larger than the attenuation length due to inelastic damping , making scattering due to concentration fluctuations negligible for impurity polaritons .",
    "this finding is in agreement with the results obtained for the one - dimensional model,@xcite and provides a firm foundation for our approach .",
    "the scattering length for regular host polaritons , at the same time , is inversely proportional to the concentration , and is rather short .",
    "therefore , studying optical properties related to these excitations requires more elaborate theoretical approaches used in many papers on the subject ( see , for instance , ref . ) .",
    "we hope that the present results will revive an interest of experimentalists in the properties of _ restrahlen _ of mixed crystals . in our opinion , it would be interesting to study transmission spectra through thin slabs of one - two mode crystals in both sw and time resolved experiments .",
    "such experiments could provide additional insight into properties of impurity polaritons , and elucidate their dynamic properties , such as group velocities . comparing experiment and present theoretical results ,",
    "one can obtain additional information about the material parameters of these systems .    _ note added in proof _ a.j .",
    "sievers drew our attention to an alternative explanation of the ir reflection spectra of _",
    "cucl_. in refs .",
    "[ 39 ] , an additional absorption line inside the gap was attributed to the interaction of to phonons with acoustic phonons arise from by strong anharmonic terms in the potential of _ cu _ atoms , rather than due to an additional polariton band associated with the off - center ions . although there exists strong evidence in favor of the model discussed in refs .",
    ", it does not explain , however , the enhanced transmission observed in ref . .",
