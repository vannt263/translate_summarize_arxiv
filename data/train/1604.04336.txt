    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide a vital tool to mimic the matter of the early universe at microseconds after the big bang .",
    "it is believed that this kind of matter is at a deconfined quark - gluon partonic state  @xcite .",
    "one of the important experimental methods is so - called nuclear modification factor which helps to understand the partonic matter created in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) . in particularly , the observed strong suppression of identified particle spectra at high @xmath3 in au+au collisions with respect to the data in p+p collisions , i.e. so - called the jet quenching phenomenon , is attributed to parton energy loss when particle traverses through the hot medium  @xcite . intriguing phenomenon on stronger @xmath4 suppression at forward rapidity in comparison to the result at middle rapidity has been observed and is interpreted as a combined contribution from hot matter effect and cold nuclear matter effect  @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental data from d+au collisions at rhic and from p+pb collisions at lhc show that nuclear modification factor of @xmath0 mesons at forward rapidity is strongly suppressed in the d ( p ) going direction than the au ( pb ) going direction  @xcite . and",
    "the theoretical understanding of the new data at forward rapidity is limited .",
    "for example , how large fraction of the cold nuclear matter effect contributes to the data , or if the cold nuclear matter effect and the hot matter effect can be factorised , is not clear . in this paper",
    ", we use a multiphase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite to investigate the dynamic process of @xmath0-meson production in d+au collisions at the rhic and p+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "we find that a parton cross section of 1.5@xmath5 applied in the ampt model describes the @xmath0-meson spectra at forward / backward rapidity well .",
    "the current study is different from the previous study on the identified particle production in d+au collisions in the mid - rapidity region , where final state interaction plays a dominated role in the @xmath6 spectra of @xmath7 , k and p @xcite .",

    "the ampt model is a hybrid model including the following four main components @xcite : the initial condition , the partonic interactions , the conversion from partonic matter into hadronic matter and the hadronic interactions .",
    "the initial condition , which includes the spatial and momentum distributions of minijet partons and soft string excitation , are obtained from the hijing model @xcite .",
    "scattering among partons are modelled by zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) @xcite , which at present includes only two - body scattering with cross sections obtained from the pqcd with screening masses . in the default ampt model",
    ", partons are recombined with their parent strings when they stop interaction , and the resulting strings are converted to hadrons using a lund string fragmentation model @xcite . in the ampt model with string melting ,",
