    "the determination of the hubble parameter , @xmath7 has a practical and theoretical importance to many astrophysical properties and cosmological observations like cosmological rulers , the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and the age of the universe @xcite . due to the degeneracy on the parameter space , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) alone can not put the strong constraint on the present value of the hubble parameter , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to obtain accurate and indepentent bounds on the @xmath3 from many different kinds of observations .",
    "the hubble key project uses the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to establish the most precise optical determination of @xmath10 ( km / s / mpc ) @xcite .",
    "the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hst using nearby cepheids and supernovae ( sne ia ) determines the value @xmath11 ( km / s / mpc ) with 3.3 % uncertainty @xcite",
    ".    the so called `` cosmic chronometers '' approach provides an independent method to constrain @xmath7 from the differential evolution of massive and passive early type galaxies .",
    "one can estimate the expansion rate of the universe at different epoches using the age difference between two passively evolving old elliptical galaxies @xcite . by using spectroscopic data of passive early - type galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ,",
    "the present value of hubble parameter is obtained as @xmath12 ( km / s / mpc ) @xcite .",
    "the hubble parameter also can be obtained from the measurements of the angular diameter distance from galaxy clusters via sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) combined with measurements of the x - ray flux . in order to obtain the hubble parameter value from these measurements , one needs to break the degeneracy on the cosmological parameters by applying joint analysis involving the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) or the cmb shift parameter . for a flat @xmath13cdm model , the present value is given by @xmath14 ( km / s / mpc ) @xcite .",
    "we can also measure the hubble parameter from the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "both the diameter distance and the hubble parameter can be measured from the bao .",
    "using the sdss iii bao spectroscopic survey from data release 9 of 264,283 galaxies , the hubble parameter value at the effective redshift @xmath15 is measured as @xmath16 ( km / s / mpc ) @xcite .",
    "however , there exists tension in the present value of hubble parameter between the above mentioned methods and the recently released by planck satellite mission .",
    "the planck cmb only data provides the value @xmath17 ( km / s / mpc ) @xcite .",
    "thus , we need to check the consistency of the current measurements of @xmath18 with various aspects . if we break the assumption that the cosmological constant as a dark energy , then this tension can be released @xcite .",
    "thus , one can regard the other mechanism to accelerate the current accelerating expansion of the unvierse like the quintessence models or the modified gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the modified gravity theories can produce the different matter growth from the one obtained from @xmath13cdm or quintessence models .",
    "the present value of the matter energy density contrast , @xmath0 is a nuisance cosmological parameter which is prerequisite to measure the hubble parameter .",
    "we will discuss the method to extract the values of both @xmath0 and the hubble parameter from the observed redshift space distortions ( rsds ) due to the falling of galaxies onto a cluster .",
    "in measuring the 2 dimensional power spectrum , the geometric distortions known as the alcock - paczynski effect @xcite - distances measured along the line of sight look different to those measured perpendicular to the line of sight are degenerated with the rsds . the lifting this degeneracy",
    "have been considered @xcite and it is a prerequisite for adopting our method to extract the @xmath0 and the hubble parameter .",
    "we will show how to get both @xmath0 and the hubble parameter from the values of the normalized growth rate , @xmath4 measured from the matter power spectrum or two - point correlation function in the sec .",
    "ii . in sec iii , we will estimate the current and future constrain on the growth rate .",
    "we show the differences from the different models in sec iv . we conclude in the last section .",
    "in this section , we derive the required formulas for both the matter energy density contrast and the hubble parameter from the measurement of the redshift space distortions ( rsds ) .",
    "we will investigate the errors on both quantities from various aspects .",
    "if we consider the einstein s general relativity ( gr ) is true , then during the galaxy formation , all modes of overdensity perturbation inside the horizon evolve identically .",
    "thus , the linear perturbation of the matter ( @xmath19 ) on the sub - horizon scales where the dark energy is homogeneous is governed by @xcite _ + 2 h _",
    "= 4 g _ _ , [ deltamt ] where dot means the derivatives with respect to the cosmic time @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the mean matter density , @xmath18 is the hubble parameter given by the friedmann equation ( @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is the newtonian gravitational constant obtained from the poisson equation . the same technique was used to constrain the time variation of the newton s constant using wigglez measurement @xcite .",
    "however , we will show that the high redshift measurements are required to use this method .",
    "this equation is valid at late times and there exists the exact analytic solution for the constant equation of the state of the dark energy @xcite .",
    "the growing mode solution of @xmath24 is defined as the linear growth factor @xmath25 .",
    "the growth factor satisfies the initial conditions @xmath26 and @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial scale factor .",
    "if we change the variable in eq .",
    "( [ deltamt ] ) from @xmath20 to the scale factor , @xmath29 then we obtain a first order non - homogeneous linear differential equation for @xmath30 + h^2 = 3 h_0 ^ 2 g ( ) ^-1 a^-5 , [ ha1 ] where @xmath3 is the present value of the hubble parameter and the present value of the matter energy density contrast is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "the solution for the above equation ( [ ha1 ] ) is given by @xcite h^2(a ) ( ) ^-2 _",

    "we emphasize that the initial value @xmath35 because the sub - horizon equation ( [ deltamt ] ) is only valid at late time .",
    "we obtain the approximate solution in the above equation ( [ deltamt ] ) because we use @xmath33 in the solution .",
    "if we replace @xmath33 by @xmath36 , then we recover the equality in the above eq .",
    "( [ ha2 ] ) .",
    "one can obtain @xmath0 by inserting @xmath37 in the above equation ( [ ha2 ] ) ( g_0 f_0)^2 ( 3 _ a_^1 g^2 f da ) ^-1 = ( _ 8 f_0)^2 ( 3 _ 0^z _ dz ) ^-1 , [ omo ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the present values of @xmath25 and @xmath40 , respectively . in the second equality , we also use the fact that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the present value of root - mean - square amplitude of the linear mass density fluctuation on a smoothing sphere of @xmath43mpc radius .",
    "we represent the above equation ( [ omo ] ) by using @xmath44 because they can be measured by the rsds from the matter power spectrum or the two point correlation function .      when @xmath0 is measured by using the eq .",
    "( [ omo ] ) , we need to distinguish two main sources of its errors . first one is an intrinsic error due to the approximate sub - horizon scale solution .",
    "the other is due to the measurement errors on @xmath4 and @xmath42 from the observation .",
    "one can understand the first intrinsic error from the fact that the derived value of the present matter density contrast , @xmath45 approaches to its fiducial value , @xmath0 when @xmath33 approaches to @xmath36 .",
    "thus , this error on @xmath45 depends on @xmath46 .",
    "we show this in the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] . in this section ,",
    "we assume that the fiducial model is the flat @xmath13cdm universe .",
    "we show the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 in the left panel of fig .",
    "we show these errors for the different sets of fiducial values of @xmath0 and @xmath42 .",
    "the dotted , solid , and dotdashed lines correspond to @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively . in this analysis",
    "we adopt @xmath49 .",
    "as expected , the errors are decreased as @xmath46 increases .",
    "the larger the fiducial @xmath0 value , the smaller the error for the same value of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath50 % errors are obtained at @xmath51 , and @xmath52 for the fiducial values of @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we can obtain less than @xmath1 % errors when @xmath53 for all the models .",
    "we also check the other error on @xmath45 due to the measuring errors in @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "if we assume that the errors on the measurements of both @xmath4 and @xmath42 as @xmath56 % , then the errors on @xmath45 compared to the fiducial values are less than @xmath57 % at @xmath58 for all the models .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "this figure shows the differences between @xmath45 with the measurement errors on @xmath4 and @xmath42 and the fiducial value of @xmath0 .",
    "again , the dotted , solid , and dotdashed lines correspond to @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the induced errors on @xmath0 can be less than @xmath57 % when @xmath46 are inside @xmath59 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "these facts indicate that the main error on @xmath45 comes from the approximate solution in eq .",
    "( [ omo ] ) . thus , this method is useful when one can measure the @xmath4 up to @xmath60 .      in this subsection ,",
    "we consider how to obtain the hubble parameter and also investigate the errors on the hubble parameter . now from eqs .",
    "( [ ha2 ] ) and ( [ omo ] ) , one can obtain e(a ) & & a^-2 = a^-2 + & = & a^-2 .",
    "[ haho ] it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ haho ] ) using the redshift @xmath5 , e(z ) ( 1+z)^2 . [ hzho ] thus , one can estimate @xmath61 by using the model independent growth factor @xmath62 measurements .",
    "there are several important aspects in the above equation ( [ hzho ] ) .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ hzho ] ) is true for any dark energy model .",
    "it includes @xmath13cdm , quintessence models , and phantom models .",
    "it means that this equation is independent of the dark energy equation of state , @xmath63 .",
    "if one considers the so called `` chevallier - polarsky - linder ( cpl ) '' parametrization @xcite , then @xmath61 is represented by e(z ) = , [ ecpl ] where @xmath64 . because our fiducial model is a flat @xmath13cdm",
    ", we can put @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "second , this equation is also independent of the current value of the hubble parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "thus , one does not need to rely on the other observations for this value .",
    "also the error on @xmath61 is almost independent of the fiducial value of @xmath0 .",
    "this will be shown below .",
    "last interesting point is that one can measure the @xmath61 values at the different epochs .",
    "thus , this method is quite useful in order to compare with the data from the standard ruler method like bao which can measure @xmath7 at the specific epoch .",
    "however , there is a limitation of the accuracy on @xmath61 because of @xmath46 dependence .",
    "there also exist two errors on @xmath61 derived from eq .",
    "( [ hzho ] ) . we analyze the errors on @xmath61 at the different epoch as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath0 .",
    "these are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "again our fiducial model is a flat @xmath13cdm and we can compute the error on @xmath61 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ hzho ] ) compared to the fiducial value from eq .",
    "( [ ecpl ] ) . in the left panel of fig.[fig2 ] , we show the errors on @xmath61 at the different epoch as a function of @xmath46 when we adopt @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the small , medium , and large dots ( from bottom to top ) correspond to the errors on @xmath69 at @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , respectively . for @xmath72 , errors are smaller than @xmath1 % as long as @xmath73 . in order to measure @xmath61 with @xmath1 % level at @xmath74",
    ", one needs to extend @xmath75 .",
    "we also show the same plot for @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the right panel of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it shows the almost same behavior as the @xmath67 model .",
    "we also consider the effect of the measurement errors of @xmath62 on @xmath61 .",
    "it provides less than percent errors on @xmath61 when we consider @xmath56 % measurement errors on @xmath62 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the effect from the errors on @xmath62 both inside and outside of the square roots are compensated from both numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ hzho ] ) .",
    "thus , one can safely ignore the effect of measurement error .",
    "however , this is a systematic error related to our method and it can be added in quadrature to the statistical measurement error .",
    "based on the real observation , the integral terms in the above equations should be replaced by the so called `` trapezoidal rule '' _",

    "again the error on @xmath61 depend on @xmath46 and this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this figure",
    ", we use the uniform grid with redshift bin @xmath9 .",
    "when we use @xmath78 with @xmath79 , the error on @xmath61 compared to the fiducial value is about @xmath80 % at @xmath81 .",
    "when we use the integration , the error on @xmath61 at @xmath81 is about @xmath82 % .",
    "if we use @xmath83 for the same set of @xmath84 , then error on @xmath61 is about @xmath85 % which has about @xmath1 % error when we use the integration .",
    "even if we use the non - uniform grid , the induced error on @xmath61 is not changed much compared to uniform case .",
    "when we choose the bin size as @xmath86 , then the errors on @xmath61 at @xmath81 are about @xmath87 and @xmath88 % for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "thus , if one uses the bin interval as @xmath86 , then the error induced by the summation of the measurement will be ignorable .",
    "we show that the measurement errors on @xmath4 have negligible effect on estimating the values of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , one can compare the measurement of @xmath7 obtained from the perturbation quantities using eq .",
    "( [ hzho ] ) against the one from the background evolution by eq .",

    "<S> we investigate the method to measure both the present value of the matter energy density contrast and the hubble parameter directly from the measurement of the linear growth rate which is obtained from the large scale structure of the universe . from this method , </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the value of the nuisance cosmological parameter @xmath0 ( the present value of the matter energy density contrast ) within @xmath1 % error if the growth rate measurement can be reached @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can also investigate the evolution of the hubble parameter without any prior on the value of @xmath3 ( the current value of the hubble parameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> especially , estimating the hubble parameter are insensitive to the errors on the measurement of the normalized growth rate @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this method requires the high @xmath5 ( @xmath2 ) measurement of the growth rate in order to get the less than @xmath6 % errors on the measurements of @xmath7 at @xmath8 with the redshift bin @xmath9 . </S>",
