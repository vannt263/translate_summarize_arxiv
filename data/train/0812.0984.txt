    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by the accretion of matter onto a supermassive ( @xmath4}m_{\\odot}$ ] ) black hole .",
    "x - ray continuum emission from agn ( without jets ) is believed to originate in the innermost regions of the agn whereas ir continuum emission is believed to originate in dusty , cooler outer regions .",
    "the ir emission from agn is due to a combination of reprocessed higher energy emission as well as thermal emission from star formation .",
    "much if not most of the ir due to reprocessing comes from energy dumped in cool dusty material ( mostly out of the observers x - ray sightline ) by photons with the most energy ( x - rays ) . a comparison of the dispersion in the ir to x - ray luminosity ratios ( @xmath0 ) of a wide variety of agn should therefore allow us to constrain the range of physical properties and geometry of the x - ray reprocessing material in agn , independent of model assumptions .",
    "the standard model of agn explains the wide range of properties of observed agn in terms of viewing angle , since the equatorial flared disk expected at the heart of agn breaks spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , partially or heavily obscured agn need not be edge on , since obscuring material only needs to block the observer s sightline ( see e.g. mckernan & yaqoob 1998 ; risaliti , elvis & nicastro 2002 ; miller , turner & reeves 2008 ) .",
    "radiation reprocessing occurs in cool ( possibly obscuring ) material distributed around the agn .",
    "independent of assumptions about the distribution of cool material , the _ dispersion _ in @xmath0 can constrain the range of possible geometries and physical conditions of the obscuring , reprocessing material around the central engine .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath0 among agn also provides information about depopulation or selection effects ( bias ) , if there are values of @xmath0 that are not favoured by agn .",
    "genuine depopulation in @xmath0 space would yield model - independent information on allowed configurations of the agn central engine .",
    "the ir and x - ray emission in agn have been compared in many previous studies @xcite .",
    "most recently @xcite reveal a strong correlation between modelled intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity and near - ir nuclear luminosity , suggestive of a leaky torus of dust .",
    "@xcite find a strong correlation between mid - ir luminosity and the very hard x - ray ( 14 - 195kev ) observed luminosity , which is unaffected by absorption and indicates that the same phenomenon underlies all agn .",
    "however , as yet there have been no comparisons of the observed hard 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity with the iras band ( 12 - 100@xmath3 ) ir luminosities .",
    "the 2 - 10kev x - rays are energetic enough to emerge with relatively mild attentuation through compton - thin obscurers with absorption becoming more substantial above @xmath5 .",
    "attenuated x - rays will mostly re - emerge as ir emission .",
    "therefore , in tandem with iras band ir emission , 2 - 10kev x - rays are a good probe of absorption and subsequent reprocessing in the obscuring material around agn . in this paper , for the first time , we studied the ratio of observed 2 - 10kev x - ray emission to iras band ( 12 - 100@xmath3 ) ir emission for a large , heterogeneous sample of agn . by studying dispersions in the luminosity ratio @xmath0 of our sample ,",
    "we hope to obtain information about the _ dispersion _ of physical properties of the agn environment , independent of model assumptions .    in section  [ sec : sed ]",
    "we briefly discuss x - ray and ir luminosity of agn , including previous studies which compared emission in the two bands , and in section  [ sec : obs ] we discuss our sample of agn and associated caveats . in section",
    "[ sec : xir ] , we explore the distribution of our sample of agn in @xmath0 parameter space and we use agn classification and well - known agn to constrain the dispersion of agn in @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : blank ] we attempt to rule out selection bias as an explanation of the dispersion of agn in @xmath0 space . in section",
    "[ sec : discuss ] we discuss our results and establish model - independent constraints on the reprocessing material around agn .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] outlines our conclusions .",
    "most agn are characterized by an sed that extends at least from the ir band to the hard x - ray band , cutting off at @xmath650 - 300 kev @xcite .",
    "the broadband sed of these agn can therefore always be characterized in a naive way by the slope from the ir band to the x - ray band .",
    "the ir band emission in most seyfert agn generally peaks in the iras band ( 12 - 100@xmath3 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux from seyferts is typically strongly absorbed at energies @xmath72kev ( even at relatively low columns of @xmath8 ) and fluxes at @xmath9kev are often too low to be strongly constrained , so a widely accepted measure of x - ray emission from agn is the observed 2 - 10kev flux .",
    "absorption of 2 - 10kev x - rays becomes more substantial at columns @xmath10 and so 2 - 10kev x - rays are a useful probe of compton - thin absorbers along the agn sightline , as well as reprocessing in the agn environment . by comparing the ratio of observed 2 - 10 kev x - ray to iras - band ir emission from agn , we therefore have ( 1 ) an approximate measure of steepness over the entire sed in most agn independent of cosmology and ( 2 ) sufficient data from agn to build a statistically meaningful sample",
    ".    the observed 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux from an agn may not be the _ intrinsic _ x - ray flux of the agn . with sufficiently large absorbing columns",
    "the 2 - 10kev hard x - ray flux can be very strongly attenuated ( particularly when the absorber is compton - thick , i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "however , it can been difficult to separate agn with weak observed x - ray flux from those with genuinely weak intrinsic x - ray flux , without knowledge of the very hard x - ray flux ( @xmath12 kev or so ) . with the advent of very hard x - ray detectors with sufficient effective area ( e.g. sax , suzaku and the bat detector on swift )",
    ", it has only recently become possible to observe agn unbiased by x - ray absorption ( see e.g. @xcite ) . to illustrate the effect of absorption on the intrinsic x - ray luminosity",
    ", we shall compare the observed 2 - 10kev flux and the interpolated intrinsic 2 - 10kev flux inferred from very hard x - ray measurements for a number of well - known agn ( see  [ sec : xir ] below ) . throughout this paper",
    ", we shall refer to the _ observed _ 2 - 10kev luminosities of agn , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "comparisons of x - ray and ir emission in large samples of agn ( and normal galaxies ) find significant correlations .",
    "@xcite found a correlations between 60@xmath3 iras luminosity and _ einstein _ ( 0.5 - 4.5kev ) soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite found correlations between iras far - ir luminosity ( 60@xmath3 ) with the rosat 0.1 - 2.4kev soft x - ray luminosity . both @xcite and @xcite show a clear jump towards higher x - ray emission among broad line galaxies compared with narrow line galaxies , suggestive of increasing dominance of non - thermal emission .",
    "correlations from such heterogeneous samples of agn are important since they suggest that the same phenomenon underlies all agn .",
    "more recently , @xcite found a strong correlation ( @xmath13 ) between very hard x - ray luminosity ( 14 - 195kev ) and mid - ir luminosity in a uniform sample of hard x - ray selected agn .",
    "high angular resolution ( nuclear ) ir studies of agn have also revealed a correlation between mid - ir luminosity ( at @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ) and the modelled intrinsic hard x - ray luminosity ( 2 - 10kev ) @xcite .",
    "these studies found no significant difference in the average ratio of mid - ir luminosity to modelled intrinsic hard x - ray luminosity for agn assumed to be face - on or edge - on , which they suggest implies the dusty torus is clumpy rather than continuous , since x - rays must be leaking out from the central regions through the torus @xcite .",
    "distinguishing models of flared disks ( likely to be continuous ) from models of clumpy clouds of gas and dust is important .",
    "however , high resolution ir studies at present will : a ) not resolve most agn , so their statistics will be poor , b ) generally include contamination from surrounding star - formation and narrow line regions anyway @xcite and c ) potentially lose information about the agn - host galaxy and agn - starburst connection .",
    "such high resolution ir studies are also likely to introduce bias in favour of the nearest agn and restrict the agn sample size . by including all nuclear ir emission , we avoid assumptions about the central engine environment and we span the complete nuclear activity phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , modelled intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosities are a function of individual agn spectral models which can vary dramatically in the literature often for the same dataset ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . while estimates of observed 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity can depend on the continuum model chosen ( e.g. fek@xmath17 line , reflection continuum ) , ultimately the observed luminosity is determined simply by the statistical quality of the simplest model fit to the 2 - 10kev continuum .",
    "a statistically good fit to the data converges on the observed value of the 2 - 10kev luminosity , regardless of whether the underlying model is actually correct .",
    "however , inferring the actual intrinsic 2 - 10kev agn luminosity from a model fit can be complicated .",
    "for example , some or most of the fe k or reflected emission could originate in cold , neutral material outside the agn central engine , or absorption by ionized gas ( warm absorber or fe edges ) could be significant .",
    "therefore , by using observed 2 - 10kev luminosities , we attempt to avoid assumptions about the agn environment or individual model idiosyncracies in estimating intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "we can more accurately infer the _ intrinsic _ 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity of many of the obscured agn , by including information from very hard x - ray studies of agn ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    ".the studies from which our agn sample was derived [ tab : sample ] . listed are study , year , total number of ned objects listed in each paper and number of unique agn extracted by us from each study , which had both iras and 2 - 10kev x - ray flux measurements on ned .",
    "many agn were included in multiple studies .",
    "we did not include agn with only upper limits in either the iras band or the 2 - 10kev band . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : z ] shows the breakdown of our agn sample into ned classification and redshift .",
    "agn classification and our exclusion of agn with prominent jets is discussed in more detail in  [ sec : xir ] below . as far as agn redshift is concerned ,",
    "most ( @xmath18 ) of the agn in our sample are at low redshift ( @xmath19 ) , so the 12@xmath3 ir flux and 2 - 10 kev band x - ray flux does not include large amounts of flux redshifted from higher energies .",
    "however , for a small fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the higher luminosity agn , the observed 12@xmath3 and 2 - 10 kev fluxes may correspond to fluxes in the agn frame of @xmath21 and @xmath22kev respectively .",
    "generally in these agn , high energy x - ray flux falls off faster than the near ir flux , so in the small fraction of very distant luminous agn we expect @xmath0 to be slightly larger _ on average _ than the nearby group 1 agn ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : deep ] and related discussion below ) .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss luminosity ratios .",
    "the ir flux is measured in jy ( = @xmath23 erg @xmath24 at 100@xmath3 and @xmath25 erg @xmath24 at 12@xmath3 ) and the x - ray flux is measured in units of @xmath26 erg @xmath27 . the luminosity ( and flux ) ratios described hereafter are unitless .",
    "in this section we will start by presenting our entire agn sample in @xmath0 space using observed 2 - 10kev x - ray and iras - band ir measurements .",
    "we shall then use agn classifications to begin constraining the dispersions of different agn types in @xmath0 .",
    "we shall also introduce well - known agn typical of their classification to aid interpretation of the agn distribution .",
    "we shall then compare the distribution of agn in @xmath0 using far - ir ( 100@xmath3 ) and mid - ir ( 12@xmath3 ) observed luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : fir12fx ] shows the observed 2 - 10kev x - ray flux plotted against the 12@xmath3 mid - ir flux for 240/245 agn in our sample ( 5 agn had 12 @xmath3 upper limits only ) .",
    "lines of constant flux ratio are plotted ( fir / fx=1,10,100 ) to guide the eye .",
    "if we express the flux ratios from figure  [ fig : fir12fx ] in terms of luminosity ratios , the _ ratios _ remain constant , but the agn separate by a factor proportional to the distance squared .",
    "since jets will complicate our interpretation of the central engine , we excluded 20 agn with ned classifications that include prominent jets ( e.g. bl lac , blazar , lpq , blrg ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : nojets ] shows the mean hard x - ray 2 - 10kev luminosity plotted against the mean mid - ir 12@xmath3 luminosity for 215/245 of the agn in our sample .",

    "lower luminosity agn appear to span a much wider range of observed luminosities , suggestive of both highly absorbed x - ray luminosity and/or a noisy host galaxy background in ir or x - rays .",
    "the agn in fig .",
    "[ fig : nojets ] span @xmath0 space in a manner broadly similar to studies carried out using soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "although we excluded agn with prominent jets , the remaining agn may well contain weak jets , but they are not prominent enough to effect agn classification .",
    "agn with prominent jets accounted for more than half the agn with @xmath31 ergs @xmath29 , so if present and prominent , jets account for a significant proportion of x - ray luminosity . from fig .",
    "[ fig : nojets ] , there are only 3/225 agn with @xmath32 , suggesting either that @xmath32 is atypical for agn or that there is a bias against agn with @xmath32 in our sample .",
    "it is noteworthy that the 3/215 agn with @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nojets ] have weak associated jets .",
    "they are , in order of increasing x - ray luminosity : cen a , pg 1416 - 129 and pg 0026 + 129 respectively @xcite . if this interpretation is correct , newly discovered agn with @xmath32 should have associated jets .    at this point",
    ", it is useful to introduce agn classification information ( from ned ) to aid further interpretation of the dispersion of @xmath0 values among agn .",
    "broadly , we observe more active and less active agn . excluding agn with jets , the more active agn population includes seyfert 1s and some qsos .",
    "the less active population generally includes seyfert 2s , liners , llagn , ulirgs , some starburst - dominated agn and some @xmath33 region - like galaxies ( see e.g. the definition of emission line galaxies for the sample in @xcite ) .",
    "classifications are of course imperfect and so some agn may overlap between these two groups , e.g. seyfert 1.2 - 1.9 agn , as well as cross - classified agn ( e.g. agn classed both as seyfert 1 and starburst or liner & seyfert 1.5 ) . from table  [ tab : z ] above , of the 221 agn in our sample without prominent jets , 153/221 agn",
    "are classified by ned purely as seyferts ( sy 1,sy1.2 - 1.9 , sy2 ) , 49/221 agn are classified as sy@xmath34 or seyfert plus something else ( e.g. starburst , @xmath35 region , liners ) and only 19/221 are non - seyfert agn .",
    "the 49/221 agn classified as sy@xmath34 highlight the difficulty of relying too heavily on agn classifications , since the observed properties of many agn can not be forced into simple classifications .",
    "such cross - classification also demonstrates the importance of an approach such as ours ; namely a simple comparison of observables across a wide range of agn activity .",
    "we categorized the remaining 215/245 agn in our sample based on their ned classification .",
    "group 1 includes agn classified by ned as seyfert 1 and qsos .",
    "also included in group 1 are agn which might overlap between groups 1 and 2 ( e.g. seyfert 1.2 - 1.9 agn and cross - classified agn ) .",
    "group 2 agn includes agn classified by ned as seyfert 2 , low luminosity agn ( llagn ) , liners , ulirgs and starburst dominated agn .",
    "table  [ tab : z ] shows that most of the agn in our sample with these latter classifications are also classified as seyfert agn , again indicating the complexities of agn classifications .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] shows the two agn populations highlighted with a dashed line indicating @xmath36 . also indicated are a few very well - known archetypal agn .",
    "we included two well - known agn with jets , the blazar 3c 273 and the bl lac pks 2155 - 304 ( indicated by open circles ) .",
    "these two agn have some of the smallest observed luminosity ratios ( @xmath37 ) and are associated with jets close to their sightlines .",
    "the seyfert 1 agn ( mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and akn 564 , indicated by giant squares ) have mid - range values of @xmath0 for group 1 agn .",
    "the starburst galaxy , arp 220 ( open star ) has @xmath38 , as has the seyfert 2 agn ngc 1068 ( open triangle ) .",

    "[ fig : irx12 ] , group 1 agn ( black circles ) are the more luminous agn and have a remarkably narrow dispersion in luminosity ratio ( @xmath39 ) for most ( 97/107 ) group 1 agn .",
    "of the ten group 1 agn with @xmath40 , four are cross - classified ( i.e. seyfert 1 plus starburst ) and four are heavily obscured seyfert 1s ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "so group 1 agn with @xmath40 could be accounted for either by the addition of ir luminosity from star formation or a drop in observed x - ray luminosity due to a change in partial - covering absorption @xcite .",
    "so even with our simple approach , fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] indicates that @xmath1 of group 1 agn in our sample have @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , group 2 agn ( red crosses ) generally have lower x - ray luminosities and have a wider dispersion in @xmath0 than group 1 agn .",
    "in contrast to the group 1 agn , 97/109 group 2 agn have @xmath40 , with 83/109 group 2 agn having @xmath42 .",
    "of the 12/109 group 2 agn with @xmath43 ( i.e. overlapping with the main group 1 population ) , we find that six have associated radio jets and two are compton - thin seyfert 2 agn . from table  [",
    "tab : z ] , 19/221 agn in our sample are non - seyferts , of which 10 are liners , 8 liners with @xmath44 regions and 1 qso .",
    "the liners lie in the bottom left hand corner of the group 2 distribution ( @xmath45 erg / s,@xmath46 erg / s ) and the liners with @xmath44 regions span a slightly larger range of the group 2 distribution ( @xmath47 erg / s,@xmath48 erg / s ) .    a key point from fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] is that the luminosity ratio for ngc 4945 and circinus as calculated from the interpolated intrinsic 2 - 10kev luminosity ( right point ) lies in the main luminosity ratio band of group 1 agn .",
    "this is a nice demonstration of the fact that behind the compton - thick obscuration of ngc  4945 and circinus , lies the same phenomenon as in most group 1 agn . without very hard x - ray measurements , it is very difficult to estimate intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosities for most group 2 agn in our sample and certainly any such estimates would be highly model - dependent .",
    "nevertheless , the examples of ngc 4945 and circinus indicate that the _ intrinsic _ luminosity ratios for many group 2 agn may be similar to the group 1 luminosity ratio range ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , there are many model - dependent caveats in estimating the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of an agn , so in  [ sec : discuss ] below we will take a different approach to @xcite and attempt to derive constraints on agn using _ observed _ luminosities .",
    "figure  [ fig : irx100 ] shows the mean far - ir ( 100@xmath3 ) luminosity of the agn in our sample versus the mean 2 - 10kev observed x - ray luminosity .",
    "note that several agn had ned flux measurements at @xmath50 but only upper limits at @xmath51 and vice versa , so there is not a perfect one - to - one correspondence between all points on fig .",
    "[ fig : irx100 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion in @xmath0 for the group 2 agn in particular seems to be larger in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : irx12 ] and the various archetypal group 2 agn appear more separated in luminosity ratio .",

    "the non - seyfert agn , e.g. the liners and liners with @xmath33 regions , are also highlighted . as we should expect from such low x - ray and ir luminosity sources ,",
    "liners occupy the lower left - hand corner of the group 2 agn dispersion in fig .  [",
    "fig : irx100 ] .",
    "the liners with associated @xmath33 regions have generally higher ir luminosities than the pure liners , but the x - ray luminosities remain fairly low",
    ".    figures  [ fig : irx12 ] and [ fig : irx100 ] both show a very clear distinction between the observed luminosity ratios ( and their dispersions ) for group 1 and group 2 agn .",
    "however , based on the modelled intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity , @xcite found that the near - ir to x - ray luminosity ratios for group 1 and group 2 agn were very similar .",
    "figure  [ fig : lutz ] is as fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] , but with open circles denoting agn from the study by @xcite and the ranges of _ intrinsic _ luminosity ratio established by @xcite for group 1 ( solid lines ) and group 2 ( dashed lines ) agn .",
    "the dispersion in the luminosity ratio of our group 1 agn matches that found by @xcite quite well , indicating that observed and intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosities are similar in most group 1 agn .",
    "our group 2 population seems to diverge dramatically in luminosity ratio from the range found by @xcite , suggesting that the observed and intrinsic 2 - 10kev luminosities in group 2 agn are indeed dramatically different . however , @xcite estimate the intrinsic x - ray luminosity in the group 2 agn based on different model fits in the literature , which ( a ) can vary for the same agn dataset and which ( b ) lead to model - dependent constraints on agn structure ( e.g. a clumpy torus as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , an ir - x - ray luminosity ratio based on the observed 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : lutz ] ) will help us avoid model assumptions about agn structure and the agn environment ( see  [ sec : discuss ] below ) .",
    "the observed ir band emission from agn should consist of some fraction of reprocessed radiation from the agn typically peaking in the mid - ir ( e.g. @xcite ) and some fraction of emission from star formation typically peaking in the far - ir ( e.g. @xcite ) plus intrinsic ir from the sed .",
    "therefore , by comparing the observed mid- and far - ir luminosities in group 1 and group 2 agn , we may be able to distinguish dominant components of ir in different agn .",

    "the dispersion in both groups is also similar ( roughly an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the @xmath57 ratio also appears to neatly separate out the archetypal group 2 agn , in order of most cold ( 100@xmath3 ) dust to least cold dust .",
    "evidently the starburst arp 220 ( open star ) has by far the highest value of @xmath57 ( as we should expect e.g. @xcite ) followed by the compton - thick agn seen in transmission ( ngc 4945- open square ) , circinus ( open diamond ) and ngc 1068 ( open triangle ) respectively .",

    "so , are the unoccupied regions of the @xmath0 plot genuinely depopulated , providing a model - independent constraint on agn structure , or is there a selection effect at work ?",
    "first , flux limits from all - sky surveys in both the ir band and the x - ray band allow us to establish which regions of @xmath0 are probably genuinely unoccupied by agn .",

    "the rosat survey was carried out in soft x - rays ( 0.1 - 2.4kev ) and will undercount heavily absorbed agn ( ie group 2 agn ) in this band .",
    "so , since group 1 agn are not very heavily absorbed in the soft x - ray band and since 115/116 of the group 1 agn in our sample are detectable in the 2 - 10kev band at rosat flux levels , the rosat limits are a reasonable proxy for x - ray flux limits for group 1 agn .",
    "this is the best that we can do since surveys overlapping the 2 - 10kev band , are neither all - sky nor complete @xcite .",
    "distances of a few tens of mpc correspond to a volume of space spanning all varieties of nuclear activity , so it seems probable that empty regions in the upper right corner of @xmath0 are genuinely depopulated by luminous ( group 1 ) agn .",

    "similarly , any low luminosity agn , undiscovered at 12@xmath3 must lie below the corresponding horizontal luminosity distance detection limit ( e.g. a type 2 qso at 100mpc undiscovered at 12@xmath3 must lie below the horizontal 100mpc line ) .",

    "furthermore , the t - statistic for these low and high z group 1 agn has a significance of 0.5 , indicating that the @xmath63 and @xmath64 populations do not originate in distributions with substantially different mean values of @xmath0 . in future work , we anticipate extending our sample with a view to obtaining strong statistical constraints on the value of @xmath0 in agn .    another way of assessing the depopulation of regions of the @xmath0 plot is by considering the dispersion of complete samples of agn .",
    "the samples of @xcite and @xcite in table  [ tab : sample ] correspond to complete , flux - limited iras samples at 12@xmath3 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "however , in each case , only @xmath68 of each sample have 2 - 10kev x - ray data . however , the sample of @xcite in particular spans most of our range of @xmath69 space , so a comparison of our sample with @xcite could tell us if we are under - sampling a particular region of parameter space .",

    "[ fig : iras12sample ] ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "once again , it is clear that this sample spans the existing ranges of @xmath0 space and does not stake out otherwise unoccupied regions .    in order to test the effect of agn redshift on our sample",
    ", we studied an independent sample of 150 additional high - z agn observed from deep surveys with xmm - newton and chandra @xcite . at the high redshifts of agn in the deep surveys ( typically z@xmath73 ) ,",
    "an observed ir luminosity at @xmath74 corresponds _ approximately _ to an agn - frame @xmath50 ir luminosity ( see e.g. treister , krolik & dullemond ( 2008 ) ) and a 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity corresponds to an agn - frame @xmath75 kev x - ray luminosity ( which will typically lie within a factor of a few of the actual 2 - 10kev luminosity ) , so luminosity ratios @xmath0 for these deep agn will systematically be a factor of a few higher on average than for the local agn in fig .  [",
    "fig : irx12 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : deep ] , even without considering the systematic overestimate of @xmath0 above , the high z agn appear to closely follow the luminosity ratio for the group 1 agn in fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] and very few lie in the group 2 agn region ( 8/150 have @xmath42 ) or in the blank areas of our luminosity plot . while there are clearly many caveats to using such deep survey data ( not least assumptions about the agn sed shape based on the ir spectrum ) , it is intruiging that , even with our very simple approach , the deep survey points should follow very closely the low - z group 1 agn dispersion and not fill blank regions of the luminosity ratio plots .",
    "it is also comforting that our main distribution of group 1 agn in fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] is also consistent with the dispersion of the population of agn in @xcite , which , since the x - rays are 14 - 195kev , should be independent of x - ray absorption .",
    "much of the ir emission from active galactic nuclei should come from reprocessed x - ray emission .",
    "there should also be some component of intrinsic ir emission in the sed ( including non - thermal ir ; although we shall ignore the complication of jets in the following discussion ) and any remaining nuclear ir emission should be due to star formation in the thick dust in the nucleus .",
    "whether the dust lives in a torus ( doughnut ) or in clumps , we can characterize the ir emission from active nuclei ( without prominent jets ) as : @xmath76 + \\rm{l}_{stars}$   \\end{tabular } \\label{eq : one}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is a numerical factor from converting @xmath78 , the 2 - 10kev intrinsic x - ray luminosity to the same units as @xmath79 , @xmath80 is a factor corresponding to intrinsic ir emitted by the agn ( normalized to @xmath78 ) , @xmath81 is the covering factor of the reprocessing material , @xmath82 is the fraction of the 2 - 10kev radiation absorbed , @xmath83 is a factor depending on the details of the reprocessing physics ( including dust size & chemistry ) , @xmath84 is the fraction of the bolometric luminosity absorbed by the cool dust .    for most group 1 agn",
    "we expect , @xmath85 , so the observed luminosity ratio for most group 1 agn should be @xmath86 } \\label{eq : two}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the ratio of intrinsic to observed 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity and is a function of the column of x - ray absorbing material along the observers sightline . from figs .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] and [ fig : irx100 ] , the dispersion in @xmath0 for most ( @xmath8890% ) group 1 agn is a factor of 30 or less .",
    "therefore the total combined variation in all the multipliers in equation  [ eq : two ] must be less than thirty for most group 1 agn .",
    "the factor @xmath82 is a function both of the covering fraction of the reprocessing material and its column density ( @xmath89 ) . using xspec , we tested the effect of column density on @xmath82 by investigating the change in x - ray energy for absorbing column density in the range @xmath90 \\rm{cm}^{-2}$ ] .",
    "we found that a factor of @xmath91 increase in absorbing column density , only produced a factor of five in the x - ray energy absorbed ( similar to the results of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "so a naked group 1 agn without substantial amounts of absorbing material ( e.g. a torus ) in its environment , should have an ir flux only @xmath92th that of a group 1 agn surrounded by substantial amounts of dust ( not necessarily in the sightline ) . therefore ,",
    "total _ dispersion of @xmath2 for most group 1 agn , will include a factor of @xmath93 for @xmath94 , indicating that @xmath95 could vary collectively by as little as a factor of six , across all group 1 agn .",
    "thus , the covering factor and fraction of absorbing material ( clouds , torus , flared disk etc ) , the composition of the material ( dust chemistry , abundance , size ) , the column density of the material and the sed x - ray to ir ratio in group 1 agn _ collectively _ vary by a factor of thirty or less and possibly by as little as a factor of six .",
    "note that this is a _ model - independent result_. we have not assumed that the absorbers must either be in a torus or clouds or some combination .",
    "such a tight dispersion among group 1 agn severely restricts models of accretion , geometry and physical conditions in agn .",
    "these group 1 agn collectively span a range of @xmath96 in central black hole mass ( e.g. @xcite ) , suggesting that independent of jets , the central engines of group 1 agn are quite _ remarkably _ similar .",
    "again , it is worth noting that this remarkably small variation in agn properties is based on _ observed _ quantities and is therefore model - independent .",
    "group 2 agn , with associated star - forming regions , could have @xmath97 in equation  [ eq : one ] .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : ir12v100 ] indicates that the ratio of cold dust to warm dust ( indicative of star formation ) is an order of magnitude larger in group 2 agn than in group 1 agn . the fact that dispersion in @xmath0 is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger for group 2 agn than for group 1 agn , indicates either that ( a ) observed @xmath78 @xmath98 intrinsic @xmath78 or that ( b ) @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 in group 2 agn or both .",
    "@xcite find that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity for group 2 agn is comparable to that for group 1 agn , so in most cases observed @xmath78 is probably substantially lower than intrinsic @xmath78 .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath102 is intrinsically greater in group 2 agn than in group 1 agn .",
    "our aim was to compare common observed agn properties that encompass the continuum of agn activity in an effort to , if possible , derive model - independent constraints on agn structure and the accretion neighbourhood .",
    "we studied the observed x - ray to ir luminosity ratios of a heterogeneous sample of 245 galaxies from the literature and , in spite of our simple approach , agn variability and non - simultaneity of most of the data , we found strong trends .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] reveals the emergence of observed activity at @xmath103 . below these luminosities ,",
    "agn may compete with x - ray and ir emitters in the host galaxy ( such as ulxs , see e.g. @xcite ) or may be obscured by large columns of absorbing material . since emission from jets considerably complicates our interpretation of the observed luminosity ratios , we only considered those agn without prominent observed jets .",
    "we find that agn considered face - on or unobscured in the standard model ( our group 1 ) are tightly clustered by observed luminosity ratio ( @xmath1 have @xmath2 ) , indicating that there is very little variation between individual group 1 agn in : ( a ) intrinsic sed ( i.e. accretion flow , whether adaf , tubulent disk or both ) , ( b ) solid angle of the reprocessing ( @xmath104 ) absorber ( whether clouds , torus , flared - disk or some combination ) and ( c ) details of the absorbing material ( chemistry & dust grain sizes ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] demonstrates that underlying group 1 agn is a remarkably uniform phenomenon .",
    "[ fig : irx12 ] shows a clear difference in @xmath0 between unobscured agn ( group 1 ) and obscured & low luminosity agn ( our group 2 ) . despite the fact that our sample is _ not _ complete , our findings for the dispersion of agn",
    "are confirmed in a comparison with other , independent agn samples ( e.g. @xcite , which are not limited by x - ray absorption , or @xcite from @xmath105 ) .",
    "furthermore , subsets of our sample of 245 agn are derived from complete iras samples @xcite and these subsets at least do not span values of @xmath0 different from the rest of our sample .",
    "bias is of course a potential problem with any approach such as ours , but it is comforting that we can find some independent verification for our simple , model - independent approach .",
    "estimates of the intrinsic 2 - 10 kev luminosity for compton - thick agn from very hard x - ray ( absorption independent ) observations ( e.g. @xcite ) reveal that the intrinsic luminosity ratio is consistent with the group 1 agn ( in agreement with the findings of e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , unlike @xcite we have endeavoured to avoid the highly model - dependent business of estimating intrinsic 2 - 10kev x - ray luminosity of group 2 agn based on the 2 - 10kev observed luminosity .",
    "we also studied the far - ir to mid - ir luminosity ratios of the nuclei in our sample .",
    "we found that the @xmath51 to @xmath50 luminosity ratio ( @xmath106 ) is an extremely effective separator of the group 1(unobscured ) and group 2 ( obscured & low luminosity ) populations ( see fig.[fig : ir12v100 ] ) . using archetypal agn as a guide , this plot ranks group 2 agn in order of decreasing luminosity ratio for increasing obscuration .    in principle",
    "our approach could be applied to intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) and galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) to investigate the accretion neighbourhood around black holes on all mass scales .",
    "the outstanding question is whether reprocessing material around imbhs and gbhcs is substantially different in covering factor , structure , chemistry or reprocessing details from that around agn .",
    "are a flared disk or dusty torus associated with a minimum mass scale , or are we looking at a basically identical phenomenon across 7 - 8 orders of magnitude in mass ?",
