    "a paradigmatic system for this problem is the interaction of a two - level system ( tls ) with the quantized electromagnetic fields.@xcite in terms of the tls - photon interaction strength @xmath3 in units of frequency , the controlled tls process ( the rabi rotation ) is a strong coupling process with @xmath4 using a coherent photon state @xmath5 with a large mean number @xmath6 of photons while the long decoherence time is a weak coupling process @xmath7 within the control time . in particular , the high fidelity of the operation to an error threshold between @xmath8 and @xmath9 in fidelity demanded by fault tolerant quantum computation@xcite sets the bar for high accuracy in the theory of the open system .",

    "barnes and warren demonstrated the decoherence induced by the back action from the tls to the electromagnetic control.@xcite for a markovian system , this problem can be solved using the optical bloch equation@xcite . however , in many non - markovian systems with a structured environment , say nanocavities@xcite and photonic band gap materials@xcite , the optical bloch analysis no longer applies . because of the large hilbert space of the multimode tls - field hamiltonian",
    ", an exact diagonalization of the problem is impractical.@xcite therefore , a quantum theory suitable for a non - markovian open system with high accuracy set for our problem is needed .    in this paper",
