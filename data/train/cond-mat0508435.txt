    "there has been intense recent interest in statistical and dynamical properties associated with random networks possessing so - called `` small world '' ( sw ) properties , i.e. , networks whose bonds possess a large degree of local clustering , but with a relatively small minimal path length connecting nodes of the system .",
    "at least some of this interest has arisen from the realization that algorithmically constructed small - world networks ( swns ) introduced by watts and strogatz @xcite , and by newman and watts @xcite , appear to share many statistical features with social networks , and thus form a useful topological substrate on which to model dynamical processes relevant to the medical and social sciences @xcite .",
    "power grids and information networks may also possess properties associated with small - world or scale - free networks@xcite , and even certain aspects of polymers may be understood in terms of an underlying small - world structure @xcite .",
    "independently of their possible applications to a wide range of problems in the social , physical , and information sciences , small - world networks and their extensions are inherently interesting because they provide a class of disordered structures similar to those that have been studied in the condensed matter literature for many years simulation , kirkpatrick , odagakilax , hauskehr , parris .",
    "there is an extensive literature , for example , in which the dynamics of random walkers diffusing through various kinds of disordered media have been studied through a variety of methods , including numerical simulations @xcite , percolation ideas @xcite , effective medium theories ( emts ) , kirkpatrick , odagakilax , hauskehr , parris and others .    in the present paper we study traversal times associated with random walks on the newman - watts small - world networks ( nw - swn s ) .",
    "these structures are defined on a ring of @xmath5 sites , each of which has bonds that connect it to its @xmath6 nearest neighbors . on this translationally - invariant lattice a (",
    "generally ) disordered small - world structure is imposed , by associating with probability @xmath7 a sw connection along each of the remaining @xmath8 bonds in the system . for a given value of @xmath7 , there are on average @xmath9 small - world bonds per site in the system , a parameter that allows for a useful comparison between swns of different size . except for the endpoints at @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where the system is perfectly ordered , the network forms a disordered system on which various forms of dynamics can be studied .",
    "the new feature of our analysis , which is based upon a master equation for the site occupation probabilities @xmath12 , is that we take the jump rate @xmath2 associated with sw connections to be independent of the jump rate @xmath1 associated with steps around the edge of the network .",
    "models of this sort might arise , for example , in attempts to design , modify , or optimize existing information networks in order to reduce the mean access time , by incorporating a small number of fast connections into an existing random network already possessing a large number of other ( perhaps slower ) connections . by introducing this simple extension to the situation in which all allowed steps occur with the same probability ( and hence same transition rate ) ,",
    "our theory is able to reveal interesting universal behavior that occurs for @xmath13 including a percolation transition that occurs at a critical fraction of sw bonds .",
    "such a transition , which is clearly a consequence of a well - known result by rnyi and erds @xcite for random graphs , was not observed in earlier random walk studies of the nw - swn @xcite , in which only equal jump probabilities ( @xmath14 ) were considered . the transition that we observe numerically and",
    "analyze using a simple self - consistent effective medium theory , is critically dependent on the fact that the topological disorder associated with the small - world connections is `` quenched '' .",
    "we show , for example , that an exactly solvable model with `` annealed disorder '' , in which the walker decides at each step whether to move along the edge or to a randomly chosen site elsewhere in the network , shows no such transition as a function of the branching ratio between steps around the edge of the ring and steps associated with small - world type `` shortcuts '' .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "in the next section we introduce a master equation description of continuous time random walks on newman - watts small - world networks , and review the relation between the green s functions associated with those equations to the mean time @xmath0 for a random walker on such a network to traverse the system .",
    "we then present numerical calculations of the mean traversal time and show that for @xmath15 there is a transition in the underlying transport mode , between motion that is dominated ( and limited ) by edge diffusion and motion that takes place predominantly among small - world connections in the system . in that section also we consider a model with annealed disorder and show that it does _ not _ display the transition exhibited by the model with quenched disorder . in sec .",
    "[ emt ] we analytically consider the traversal time for nw - swn s using a simple self - consistent effective medium ( emt ) theory similar to that which has been used to understand other disordered systems . as in previous work , we find that emt provides an accurate and computationally efficient means for calculating transport properties as a function of the underlying parameters of the system , except in the immediate vicinity of the transition where the underlying transport mechanism changes abruptly .",
    "we are thus able to use it to reliably investigate , in regimes away from such points , the manner with which various transport properties scale with system size and connectivity .",
    "we consider a continuous time random walk with symmetric , translationally - invariant jump rates @xmath16 governing transitions between sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 on a 1-dimensional ring of @xmath5 sites .",
    "although it is not crucial in the analysis that follows , for specificity we assume that @xmath19 is constant and non - zero only between a given site and its @xmath6 closest neighbors on the ring , which we will refer to collectively as `` neighbor sites '' .",
    "the small - world structure of the system is imposed by associating with probability @xmath7 a nonzero sw hopping rate @xmath2 along each of the @xmath8 non - neighbor bonds in the system . for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the system is perfectly ordered ; in the former , all sites are connected , in the latter , connections occur only between sites on the periphery of the ring . for intermediate values of @xmath7 a particle moving along the ring encounters sites from which it can move across the system without taking steps to its @xmath20 nearest neighbors .",
    "the small - world connections thus superimpose a `` random graph '' structure on the otherwise translationally invariant lattice .",
    "random walks on any single nw - swn constructed in this manner can be described by the master equation @xmath21for the probability @xmath22 for the particle to be at site @xmath18 at time @xmath23 , where we assume periodic boundary conditions so that @xmath24 . in ( [ me ] ) , the first sum on the right describe steps around the edge of the ring , while the last term describes sw transitions . in this last term , the @xmath25 are symmetric random rates that in any given realization equal @xmath2 with probability @xmath7 and equal zero with probability @xmath26 .",
    "a full solution to the problem involves obtaining the set of propagators , or green s functions @xmath27 , the solutions to eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) for each initial site @xmath17 at which the particle may start .",
    "these quantities , or their laplace transforms @xmath28 are readily computed for moderately sized systems @xmath29 using standard numerical techniques .",
    "for example , rewriting the equations of motion ( me ) in the form@xmath30which along with eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) implicitly defines a transition matrix @xmath31 with elements @xmath32 , we can write the green s function in the time domain as the @xmath18-@xmath17 element of an exponential @xmath33 _ { m , n}\\]]of the matrix @xmath34 similarly , we can express its laplace transform as the corresponding element    @xmath35 _ { m , n } \\label{resolvent}\\ ] ]    of the resolvent matrix @xmath36 , which is easily computed using matrix inversion routines .",
    "numerical solutions of this sort can be used to find information about the evolution of the probabilities @xmath37 their moments , or other quantities that characterize transport in the system . in the condensed matter literature ,",
    "e.g. , much attention has been placed on calculating the diffusion constant @xmath38 which in an infinite euclidean network characterizes the asymptotic linear growth of the mean square displacement @xmath39 of an ensemble of random walkers .",
    "insofar as we are interested in the properties of finite networks , in which the mean - square displacement always saturates at long times , we focus here on calculating properties that may be more relevant to applications for which small - world concepts are currently employed .",
    "specifically , we focus here on calculating the mean traversal time @xmath0 , which we define to be the earliest time , on average , that a random walker visits the point on the ring the farthest from where it started . for a walker starting at site @xmath17 at @xmath40 the mean time @xmath41 to arrive at an arbitrary site @xmath18 for the first time",
    "is the first moment of the probability density @xmath42 for a walker to first arrive at site @xmath18 at time @xmath23 for these initial conditions , i.e.,@xmath43where in the second line we have expressed the result in terms of the laplace transform @xmath44 of @xmath45 .",
    "the first passage probability density @xmath45 is related to elements of the green s functions described above through the relation@xmath46which physically expresses the probability for the walker to be found at @xmath18 at the current time @xmath47 in terms of its probability to have arrived at that site for the first time at some earlier moment @xmath48 , and the probability that it is now at that site given that it did so . from the convolution theorem for laplace",

    "[ fig1 ] we display the results of a numerical calculation of the mean traversal time @xmath55scaled by the average nearest neighbor hopping time @xmath56 averaged over an ensemble of 100 @xmath57 nw - swn s with @xmath58 as a function of the average number @xmath51 of small - world bonds per site , for different values of the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "as expected , the mean traversal time @xmath0 decreases monotonically as the number @xmath51 of small - world connections increases . in the limit",
    "in which @xmath59 i.e. , in the absence of any small - world shortcuts , the mean traversal time reduces to the mean time @xmath60 that it takes for the walker to diffuse around the ring , for which @xmath61 also , as we might expect , for very small values of @xmath62 only modest decreases in the traversal time occur with the addition of small world network connections .    for values of @xmath63",
    "however , the situation appears very different , there generally being a very strong decrease in the traversal time near @xmath64 , and a strong collapse of the numerical data onto a single curve for values of @xmath65 . in this region",
    "sw connections are sparse , but fast .",
    "for @xmath65 and @xmath3 the sw connections act as short - circuits , but transport across the system is still limited by diffusion within segments of the ring that are free of shortcuts , because there is not in this regime a percolating path of small - world connections spanning the system . however , as shown by rnyi and erds erdos , in a completely random graph a percolating path develops ( as @xmath66 as @xmath51 approaches one from below .",
    "thus , as @xmath67 and @xmath68 percolation of the random - graph part of the nw - swn network leads to a critical change in the traversal time near @xmath69 .",
    "it is interesting to note that other transport properties of the nw - swn s , including scaling properties of the diagonal element @xmath70 of the average green s function@xcite , and the distinct number of sites visited @xmath71 by a walker on the network@xcite have been studied previously , but only for the case in which @xmath72 i.e. , in which hops associated with small - world connections occur with the same transition rate as steps along the periphery . as we see from the current study , however , the case @xmath73 lies at the edge of a parameter regime in which the behavior of the system , as a function of the number of small - world connections , changes drastically .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the quenched disorder occurring in the small - world networks is an essential element for the observed transport threshold to occur , or whether a simpler _ annealed disorder _ model with uniform trans - network connections could exhibit a similar transport transition as a function of their strength .",
    "we show explicitly below that a simple annealed disorder model does not exhibit such a transition . specifically , we study an exactly soluble model in which a walker at any site takes steps to its neighbors on the edge of the ring with rate @xmath74 as before , and takes steps to one of @xmath17 randomly chosen non - neighbor sites on the ring with rate @xmath75 but in such a way that the @xmath17 randomly chosen sites to which it may move are not fixed in time , but are selected anew _ each time",
    "the particle visits the site .",
    "_ thus , in this model , if we take @xmath76 the branching ratio between steps associated with short cuts across the system and those around the edge is , on average , the same as in the nw - swn model with quenched disorder already considered .",
    "since the _ a priori _ probability of the particle moving to any other site on the ring other than its neighbors is the same , the dynamics on this annealed disorder model is equivalent to one in which the short cuts allow the walker to move to any one of its non - neighbors with a uniform rate @xmath77where @xmath78 is the number of non - neighbor sites to which it can move .",
    "thus in any given site , the walker moves to one of its neighbors with probability @xmath79 and to a non - neighbor with probability @xmath80 the resulting master equation for this model , @xmath81is translationally invariant and readily solved by introducing fourier transformed probabilities @xmath82 .",
    "we find , e.g. , that for this annealed disorder model the laplace transformed green s functions , @xmath83 are given by the relation@xmath84 in which @xmath85@xmath86and the sum in ( [ annealg ] ) is over all wavevectors @xmath87 in the brillouin zone .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show how the mean traversal time @xmath0 scales in the annealed disorder model as function of @xmath17 ( now considered a continuous parameter ) , for various values of @xmath2 for a system with @xmath88 clearly , although the limiting diffusive behavior seen in the quenched disorder model of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the same as that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the previously observed behavior for @xmath91 , and in particular the transition near @xmath69 is completely lacking in the model with annealed disorder .",
    "thus , as we might expect , the underlying percolative behavior is clearly a property associated with a system with quenched disorder .",
    "we note in passing that the annealed disorder model described above can be viewed as an _ approximation _ to the quenched disorder model in which the random matrix @xmath54 is replaced by its ensemble average @xmath92 i.e. , in which@xmath93for disordered systems , approximations of this type are known to give results that are often qualitatively very bad , particularly in percolative systems , where they typically wash out any transition that occurs .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that the two models have very different behavior .     as a function of the mean number @xmath17 of trans - network connections per site for the annnealed disorder model on a system with @xmath94 sites , with values of @xmath53 as indicated , showing the failure of the annealed disorder to capture the transport transition observed to occur on real small - world networks.,height=240 ]",
    "it is clear that the annealed disorder model fails to capture the essential features of the transport transition that occurs in the nw small world networks .",
    "however , the idea of replacing a disordered system with a translationally - invariant one that captures , on large time and length scales , the macroscopic transport properties of the ensemble of systems that it replaces is venerable and has a long history in the condensed matter literature .",
    "indeed , the goal behind a significant body of theoretical work on various kinds of disordered systems has been to construct an appropriate , self - consistently determined effective medium , whose properties captures qualitative features of the actual system under consideration . in the next section",
    ", we explore this idea , and introduce a simple effective medium theory that does , in fact , provide an excellent quantitative prediction of the traversal time for the nw - swn in all parameter regimes except the immediate neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "theoretical justification for the search for a translationally - invariant effective medium whose properties capture the essential features of the ensemble of disordered systems that they replace ( and which capture the large time and length scale properties , typically , for any member of the ensemble ) lies with the fact that _ average _ transport properties of the ensemble are , in fact , translationally invariant .",
    "for example , the ensemble - averaged probabilities @xmath95 associated with any fixed initial condition evolve in a translationally invariant way , and therefore obey translationally invariant equations of motion which , if we knew what they were , would serve to define the effective medium that we seek . indeed , the goal of effective medium theory is to self - consistently determine properties associated with this average evolution . to this end , we consider the simplest set of linear , homogenous , and translationally - invariant equations of motion that reflect the structure of the original equations , and the symmetry properties of the underlying ensemble . in particular , the laplace transforms @xmath96 of the average probabilities @xmath97 we take to obey the equations@xmath98here , @xmath99 is a frequency - dependent rate , equivalently , a memory function in the laplace domain @xcite , connecting pairs of sites on the network capable of being connected , in any realization , by a small - world rate @xmath2 . in these effective medium equations of motion ,",
    "transport _ around _ the ring edge is characterized by the same rate @xmath1 that obtains throughout the ensemble , but @xmath100 must be determined from self - consistent considerations .",
    "note that these emt equations of motion have exactly the same form as the laplace transform of those describing the annealed disorder model of the last section , except that in that model the rate @xmath101 was simply set equal to its ensemble average , while in the current treatment @xmath102 is to be determined self - consistently through other considerations .",
    "thus , the theoretical tasks are two : ( i ) the self - consistent determination of @xmath99 as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath7 ( or @xmath103 ) , and ( ii ) the determination of transport properties arising through the solutions to ( [ ema me ] ) .",
    "both tasks require calculation of the effective medium propagators @xmath104 , i.e. , the solutions to ( [ ema me ] ) for a walker initially at the origin , @xmath105 .",
    "since the structure of the equations of motion ( [ ema me ] ) are the same as those of the annealed disorder model , the form of the effective medium green s function associated with ( [ ema me ] ) is the same as ( [ anneal g ] ) , with @xmath106 replaced by @xmath107@xmath108where @xmath109     as a function of the mean number @xmath103 of small - world connections per site on a swn of @xmath94 sites , with values of @xmath53 as indicated .",

    ". we proceed as in other emts kirkpatrick , odagakilax , hauskehr , parris , by embedding in the effective medium a typical `` fluctuation from the average '' associated with the disorder , and then requiring that upon averaging over the distribution associated with this fluctuation we recover the effective medium in which it was embedded .",
    "thus , we consider the bond between the origin and some other non - neighbor site @xmath17 on the ring , and replace the effective medium bond @xmath113 between those two sites with an actual rate @xmath114 ( @xmath115 or @xmath2 ) , drawn from the ensemble . for a particle placed at the origin ,",
    "the resulting @xmath116 obey @xmath117where @xmath118 .",
    "the solution to the set of equations ( defect ) can be written in terms of ( [ ema g ] ) as @xmath119where @xmath120 and @xmath121    we now impose self - consistency , and require that , upon averaging ( defect solution ) over the dichotomous distribution @xmath122of the rates @xmath123 , on the one hand , _ and _ the location @xmath17 of the small - world connection , on the other , we recover the propagator for the effective medium .",
    "for this to occur , the second term on the right hand side of ( [ defect solution ] ) must average out to zero .",
    "this leads to the self - consistent condition@xmath124from which @xmath99 can be determined . for @xmath125 and @xmath126 respectively , the solutions reduce to the exact results . for @xmath127 or @xmath128 , eq.([scc ] )",
