    "recently , an optimal hamiltonian has been derived in the statistical mechanics approach to @xmath0-state neural networks starting from the concept of mutual information @xcite,@xcite .",
    "optimal means that the best retrieval properties are guaranteed including , e.g. , the largest retrieval overlap , loading capacity , basin of attraction , convergence time . for @xmath1",
    "this hamiltonian resembles the classical blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) hamiltonian in the sense that it contains both a bilinear and biquadratic term in the spins @xcite . for a fully connected architecture",
    "it has been shown , using a thermodynamic replica approach that the maximal loading capacity for the beg network is indeed bigger than the one for other three - state networks existing in the literature ( ising , potts ... ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these new type of neural network models is under investigation . in the case of an asymmetric extremely diluted architecture where one knows that there are no feedback loops complicating the time evolution ,",

    "e.g. , @xmath0-ising models ( see @xcite and references therein ) one knows that the dynamics is very non - trivial due to the feedback in the system @xcite .",
    "this feedback causes the appearance of discrete noise , besides gaussian noise , involving the neurons at all previous time steps and prevents a closed - form solution .    in this work",
    "we generalize the probabilistic approach that has been developed for the hopfield model @xcite , @xcite and @xmath0-ising model @xcite in order to solve the dynamics for the fully connected beg model at zero temperature .",
    "thereby , we start from the time evolution of the distribution of the local field , instead of working directly with the order parameters .",
    "we study the structure of this distribution in detail and , using this knowledge , we develop a recursive scheme in order to calculate the relevant order parameters of the system , i.e. , the main overlap , the neural activity , the activity overlap and the variance of the residual overlap at any time step . as an illustration we write out these expressions in detail for the first few time steps of the dynamics .",
    "furthermore , by requiring the local field to be time - independent , implying that some correlations between its gaussian and discrete noise parts are neglected , we derive fixed - point equations for the order parameters . they coincide with those derived via thermodynamical methods @xcite .",
    "finally we perform numerical simulations of a beg network with @xmath2 neurons .",
    "they confirm the analytical results we have derived .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mod ] we introduce the model , its dynamics and the relevant order parameters . in section [ sec : gensch ] we use the probabilistic approach in order to derive a recursive scheme for the evolution of the distribution of the local field , leading to recursion relations for the order parameters . using this scheme , we explicitly calculate in appendix  a the order parameters and in appendix  b the local field for the first few time steps of the dynamics . in section [ sec : fixp ] we show the existence of a lyapunov function at zero temperature and we discuss the evolution of the system to fixed - point attractors . section [ sec : fields ] details the structure of the local field distribution , especially the appearance of gaps .",
