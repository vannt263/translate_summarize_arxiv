    "for some time there has been a growing interest in the theoretical prediction of long - time dynamics and equilibration in hot quantum field theories .",
    "one driving motivation has been understanding the early universe , particularly the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis ( for an older but still quite pertinent review see @xcite ) . in this case one",
    "is interested in dynamics of the electroweak sector , su(2)+higgs with a coupling @xmath2 .",
    "another motivation is attempting to describe high energy heavy ion collisions , which are being experimentally probed at rhic and will soon be probed at even higher energies at the lhc .",
    "since one of the original motivations for this program was to explore qcd in a regime where it is thermal and ( relatively ) weakly coupled , it makes sense to see how far one can go in its description using weak - coupling tools , even though the gauge coupling is not expected to be _ very _ small , @xmath3 at best .",
    "some of the most interesting and difficult problems involve understanding long - time dynamics and the approach to equilibrium .",
    "transport coefficients are a theoretically well - defined and interesting subset of these problems .",
    "recently there has been great interest in the shear viscosity , because rhic results on elliptic and radial flow and spectra seem to indicate that the viscosity is surprisingly small @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "great strides have been made in the theoretical evaluation of transport coefficients . in a pioneering paper ,",
    "jeon showed how to calculate the shear viscosity of @xmath0 theory at leading order in the coupling @xcite .",
    "he showed that the evaluation reduces to a problem in kinetic theory .",
    "since then , kinetic theory treatments of qed and qcd transport coefficients ( electrical conductivity , conserved number diffusion , and shear and bulk viscosity ) have appeared at leading - log @xcite and full leading order @xcite . the kinetic treatment has also been justified diagrammatically at leading - log @xcite and leading order @xcite .    however , except for two unrealistic simplifying limits ( large @xmath4 gauge theory @xcite and large @xmath5 o(@xmath5 ) scalar field theory @xcite ) , there are no results beyond leading order in weak coupling for any long - time dynamical quantities in any interacting relativistic 3 + 1 dimensional gauge theory .",
    "we feel this is a big hole in the literature , because without any knowledge of subleading corrections , it is hard to know how quickly perturbation theory converges . on the other hand ,",
    "a subleading result gives at least a hint of how fast the series converges ; when the subleading correction becomes as large as the leading order result , perturbation theory has almost surely failed . with this in mind",
    ", this brief report will compute the shear viscosity of the simplest toy theory , @xmath5 component @xmath0 theory at general @xmath5 , at next - to - leading order .",
    "the reason this is possible , and a main reason it is interesting , is that the subleading correction emerges from soft physics . in this theory",
    ", the plasma of scalars induces an effective mass for all scalar excitations , @xmath6 . but soft scalars play an important role as the `` targets '' in scattering processes .",
    "the scalars which are significantly influenced by this effective mass represent the target in @xmath7 of scattering events",
    ". therefore the scattering rate , and with it all long - timescale dynamical quantities , receive @xmath8 corrections .",
    "actually , both this thermal mass and the mass dependence of the shear viscosity were mentioned by jeon @xcite , so his 1995 paper technically represented an nlo calculation , not just the leading - order one he claimed .",
    "but this was not mentioned ( or recognized ) in that paper , so we feel that a clear discussion is warranted .",
    "first we review jeon s leading order calculation , emphasizing where higher order corrections can arise .",
    "the shear viscosity is defined as a correction to the ( local ) equilibrium form for the stress tensor when a fluid undergoes nonuniform flow . for a flow velocity",
    "@xmath9 satisfying @xmath10 , the stress tensor in the local rest frame is t_ij = p _ ij - + o(^2 ) , with @xmath11 the viscosity .",
    "a fluctuation - dissipation relation ( kubo formula ) relates this coefficient to a certain stress - stress correlation function @xcite : = _ 0 _ 0 d^4 x e^i(k_i x_i - x_0 ) , where @xmath12 .",
    "this relation is the starting point for a perturbative analysis .",
    "one wants the correlation function of two stress operators , at zero spatial momentum and in the limit of vanishing frequency .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the obvious leading - order diagram , together with another diagram which is also leading - order for a subtle reason .",
    "the heavy lines represent self - energy resummed propagators . the propagators with the same label carry opposite momenta for all values of all loop momentum integration variables ; therefore when one goes on - shell , the other goes on - shell simultaneously , leading to a pinch singularity .",
    "if not for the width @xmath13 , the result would diverge ; instead it is enhanced by a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore we must sum all diagrams with @xmath15 such pinches and @xmath16 loops .",
    "more loops without extra pinches are generally suppressed by a power of @xmath17 per loop .",
    "the set of diagrams which we must resum turns out to be all diagrams structurally like the second diagram of figure [ fig1 ] , and up to subleading in @xmath17 corrections , their resummation gives precisely the same description of @xmath11 which we would get from kinetic theory .",
    "the kinetic description takes the plasma to be made up of weakly coupled quasiparticles which undergo occasional scatterings described by a boltzmann equation .",
    "the relevance of quasiparticles arises because of the importance of nearly on - shell propagators in evaluating the diagrams ; the scattering processes arise from evaluating the self - energy corrections to these propagators , which give rise to @xmath13 . according to kinetic theory ,",
    "the stress tensor is determined by the distribution function for particles @xmath18 through t_ij(x ) = f(x , ) .",
    "this distribution function evolves according to the boltzmann equation , [ boltzmann1 ] + = -c[f ] , [ boltzmann2 ] c[f ] & = & |m_pkpk|^2   + & & ( 2)^4 ^4(p+k - p-k )   + & & ( f ( ) f ( ) [ 1+f()][1+f( ) ]   + & & - f( ) f( ) [ 1+f()][1+f ( ) ] ) . in writing bose stimulation functions",
    "we have assumed all bosonic species ; we have also neglected higher order scattering processes , as justified by our expansion in @xmath17 .",
    "nonuniform flow velocity means that the equilibrium distribution function would be @xmath19 -1 \\big)^{-1}\\ ] ] and the spatial derivative in acts on this to give @xmath20 .",
    "this term drives the system from equilibrium .",
    "the collision term vanishes if @xmath21 but is linear in departures @xmath22 ; such a departure will arise and grow until the collision term and the gradient term cancel ( remember that we want the vanishing frequency or long - time behavior ) . the departure from equilibrium will be of the same structural form as the spatial derivative term ; f(x , ) = f_0 + ( _ i v_j ) f_0(1+f_0 ) ( |p| ) , with @xmath23 a function of the magnitude of @xmath24 only , determined by solving eqs .",
    "( [ boltzmann1],[boltzmann2 ] ) .",
    "this is most conveniently done by defining an inner product @xmath25 and a functional @xmath26 $ ] @xcite , [ q ] q",
    "[ ] = t | - | c_lin | , where @xmath27 is a linearization of the collision operator given below . the @xmath28 which extremizes @xmath29 solves the boltzmann equation , and the extremal value of @xmath29 is @xmath30 .",
    "the advantage of the diagrams is that they help us see where the perturbative argument that further corrections are down by @xmath31 can break down . specifically , for generic momenta",
    "an extra loop is @xmath31 .",
    "the self - energy resummation is an @xmath31 correction unless the propagator momentum is soft or close to the light - cone .",
    "near the light - cone , the width correction is essential , but it is already incorporated in the leading - order calculation and it naively receives only @xmath31 corrections from higher order diagrams .",
    "the one - loop self - energy leads to a mass correction mentioned in the introduction , @xmath32 for @xmath5 component scalar theory with o(@xmath5 ) symmetry and interaction @xmath33 .",
    "this mass correction shifts the propagating pole by @xmath31 for generic momentum @xmath34 .",
    "however , for @xmath35 , the shift to the propagating pole is an @xmath36 correction .",
    "therefore , in any diagram where one of the lines is soft , @xmath37 , there will be @xmath36 interaction corrections not taken into account in the leading - order analysis .",
    "how important are soft momenta ?",
    "it turns out that @xmath38 vanishes as @xmath39 at small momenta , meaning that particles at these momenta are very near equilibrium and do not contribute significantly to @xmath40 , despite the @xmath41 enhancement factor .",
    "therefore the first term in is only sensitive to dispersion corrections at @xmath31 .",
    "however , such particles _ are _ of some importance as scatterers . to see this ,",
    "first let us estimate what fraction of all particles are so soft .",
    "the total particle number density is @xmath42 .",
    "the soft contribution is @xmath43 .",
    "( phase space gives three factors of @xmath44 but the distribution function is @xmath45 in the soft region . )",
    "soft particles are therefore an @xmath46 fraction of all particles .",
    "in addition , scattering cross - sections generically scale as @xmath47 ( the mandelstam variable ) , and when a @xmath48 particle scatters from a @xmath49 particle , @xmath50 is smaller than @xmath51 valid for generic scattering",
    ". therefore the cross - section is enhanced by a @xmath52 factor , and the relative rate of scatterings from a soft target is actually @xmath53 .",
    "so soft scatterings are an @xmath54 fraction of all scatterings .",
    "do they matter to equilibration ?",
    "the answer is yes ; while the incoming particle is soft , most of the phase space for the scattering shares the final state energies roughly equally .",
    "this means that the hard particle retains its direction of flight but substantially changes its energy , and since the departure from equilibrium has a strong energy dependence , this is relevant . to calculate it",
    ", we need to perform the scattering calculation more carefully , incorporating the soft phase - space dispersion relation .",
    "the collision term we need for the functional @xmath26 $ ] is [ chicchi ]",

    "the phase space is most conveniently dealt with in terms of the total energy @xmath55 and momentum @xmath56 , two particle momenta , and an azimuthal angle . for massless dispersion relations , this `` s - channel '' parametrization reduces to @xcite & & ( 2)^4 ^ 4(p+k - p-k )   + & = & _ 0^ d_0^ dq _ ^",
    "dp _ ^ dp _ 0 ^ 2 .",
    "the relations between these variables and the relative angles of the particles are given in @xcite , and can be used to evaluate .",
    "the particle energies are @xmath24 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60 region is @xmath61 suppressed , as all four variables must be @xmath62 .",
    "[ there is a @xmath63 enhancement from the population functions , but a @xmath64 suppression from the small value of @xmath65 , so this region really is @xmath66 . ]",
    "a region with one soft particle is @xmath67 suppressed ; for instance , for soft @xmath24 , both @xmath24 and @xmath68 must be @xmath69 .",
    "however , one of the statistical functions in is @xmath70 in this case , and there is no suppression from the values of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore the contribution is @xmath72 , as stated above .",
    "note however that two soft particles ( say , @xmath73 ) is @xmath74 suppressed , compensated by two powers of population functions but further suppressed by cancellations in the @xmath28 functions ; so this region is @xmath31 at most .    for the massive case it is more convenient to work in terms of particle energies rather than momenta . as just discussed , we need only consider the case where one particle is soft . in the small @xmath75 region , and taking @xmath76 , the @xmath77 phase space is modified by ^dq _",
    "dp = _ 0 dp _ -2p^ dq _",
    "m dp^0 _ -p^0-p^-p^0+p dq , with @xmath78 .",
    "if we consider the difference between the collision integral with and without massive dispersion , we want the difference between these integrations . in this difference region , we can take @xmath75 small , allowing the substitution @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , we may neglect @xmath81 and set @xmath82 .",
    "in this region , @xmath83 and the final state momenta @xmath57 , @xmath84 are collinear , so & & ( _ ij(p)+_ij(k)-_ij(p)-_ij(k ) ) ^2   + & & ( ( ) - p ( p ) - ( p ) ( p ) ) ^2 .",
    "the @xmath85 and @xmath86 integrals then factorize , such that & & | c_lin_,m=0 | - | c_lin_,m |   + & = &   + & & _ 0^d_0^dp f_0 ( ) e^f_0(p ) f_0(p )   + & & ( ( ) - p ( p ) - ( p ) ( p ) ) ^2 .",
    "[ deltac ] here the factor of 4 counts the fact that there are 4 such `` corners '' of phase space where a particle becomes soft , and we have only considered the contribution of one of them .",
    "note that the @xmath57 integral is insensitive to the edges @xmath87 and @xmath88 of its range , so there is no problem of overcounting .",
    "the bracketed integral gives @xmath89 .",
    "we want to perturb in the small mass .",
    "therefore it is fair to write the collision operator as _",
    "lin = c_lin , m=0 + with @xmath90 equal to minus the expression in .",
    "the correction to @xmath29 in is therefore @xmath91 .",
    "the change in the extremal value at linear order in @xmath90 is just found by evaluating this using the unperturbed extremal value of @xmath28 .",
    "what remains is to solve the variational problem with the unperturbed collision operator and to substitute the result for @xmath28 into .",
    "we handle the variational problem using the multi - parameter  method developed in @xcite .",
    "since we are tuning the function @xmath28 using the @xmath92 collision operator , the evaluation of @xmath93 , going from 2 to 4 functions changes it @xmath94 , going from 4 to 6 functions changes it @xmath95 , and going from 6 to 8 changes it @xmath96 .",
    "our result in the one - component theory , using an 8 basis function expansion , is = t^3 where both integration and basis size errors should be smaller than the last digit shown .",
    "the viscosity increases because the thermal mass reduces the number of soft targets , and viscosity is inversely related to the scattering rate .",
    "jeon found a leading result 5% smaller and a mass correction 15% larger , presumably because of lower quality numerics .",
    "the result can be extended to the o(@xmath5 ) symmetric theory by scaling the number of species by @xmath5 and the scattering rate and thermal mass each by @xmath97 .",
    "we have shown that the first corrections to the leading - order calculation of the shear viscosity in scalar @xmath98 theory arise at order @xmath8 .",
    "they originate because scattering processes are sensitive to soft ( @xmath99 ) particles at that order , and soft particles behavior is modified by plasma effects at the @xmath36 level .",
    "all of these remarks should apply to gauge theories including qcd .",
    "however , the details of the calculation in those cases will be more complex , since the dispersion relations are modified in a more complex manner in gauge theories , and in nonabelian gauge theories the mutual interactions between soft particles are also strongly modified @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations for this work was to analyze the convergence of the perturbative treatment .",
    "what we have shown is that the first subleading correction is a small correction provided @xmath100 .",
    "this is satisfied if @xmath101 . the thermal pressure converges in a comparable sized range @xcite .",
    "so does vacuum perturbation theory ; the ratio of the @xmath102 function to the coupling @xmath103 is small for @xmath104 .",
    "therefore the subleading corrections only become large when the theory is approaching its landau pole .",
    "since the origin of the leading - order correction is well understood , we might hope that the explicit inclusion of the thermal mass in the external state dispersion , and a resummation of the thermal mass via a gap equation , might improve the convergence of the series , as has been argued for the calculation of the pressure @xcite .",
    "aarts and martinez - resco have done this in the large @xmath5 theory , where it is well justified at leading order in a @xmath105 expansion @xcite .",
