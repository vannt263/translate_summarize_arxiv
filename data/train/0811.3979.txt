    "the potential of utilizing low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that show thermonuclear x - ray bursts to measure the masses and radii of their neutron stars has long been recognized ( see , e.g. , van paradijs 1978 , 1979 ; lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) . during these short - lived flashes , bright thermal emission from the surface of the neutron star is observed , allowing , in principle , a measurement of the stellar radius or its surface gravity . indeed , a number of methods that involve the luminosity , surface redshift , or flux oscillations during these bursts have been proposed and used to measure or constrain the masses and radii of neutron stars in lmxbs ( for a recent review , see lattimer & prakash 2007 ) . here ,",
    "we focus on the time - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of thermonuclear x - ray bursts observed from 4u  1608@xmath052 in order to measure both the mass and the radius of its neutron star .    in a subset of thermonuclear bursts called photospheric radius expansion ( pre ) bursts , the source flux reaches a peak that is thought to correspond to the local eddington flux on the stellar surface , which is related to the mass and the radius of the neutron star . a second spectroscopic quantity that can be used to infer the mass and the radius of the neutron star is observed during the cooling tails of thermonuclear bursts . during this cooling phase ,",
    "the measured apparent area of the emitting region remains constant while both the flux and the color temperature decrease .",
    "it has been shown that the observed surface areas remain constant between different bursts of the same source ( galloway et al .",
    "2008a ) , indicating that the emission arises from a reproducible area on the stellar surface , likely corresponding to the entire neutron star surface .",
    "in addition to these two spectroscopic quantities , determining both the neutron star mass and its radius requires an independent distance or gravitational redshift measurement ( see , e.g. , zel 2006 ; zel , gver , & psaltis 2009 ; for a review of earlier results , see lewin et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "apart from sources in globular clusters , independent measurements of distances to lmxbs have been a long - standing challenge ( see , e.g. , van paradijs & white 1995 ) . with the advances in high - resolution x - ray",
    "grating spectroscopy , it is now possible to determine the x - ray absorption towards lmxbs with enough precision to allow studies of the properties of interstellar matter ( ism ) towards these sources ( see , e.g. , juett , schulz , & chakrabarty 2004 ; juett et al .",
    "2006 ; wroblewski , gver , & zel 2008 ) .",
    "extinction measurement can in principle allow for a distance measurement if combined with a good standard candle within the field of view to an x - ray binary .",
    "red clump stars have shown to be such standard candles ( paczynski & stanek 1998 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "they are core helium - burning giants that form a well - defined concentration of stars in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . because their luminosities are largely independent of the total stellar mass and their infrared colors are insensitive to metallicity , they can be used to measure the run of reddening with distance . finding the distances to lmxbs , then ,",
    "involves a comparison of the extinction measurement of the x - ray source to that of red clump stars in the same field of view .",
    "a very similar technique has already been successfully applied to anomalous x - ray pulsars by durant & van kerkwijk ( 2006a , 2006b ) .    in this study",
    ", we measure the distance to the lmxb 4u1608@xmath052 using the red clump method in order to ultimately determine the mass and the radius of its neutron star . in detail , we _",

    "finally , we _ ( vi ) _ fit x - ray burst spectra to measure the eddington flux and apparent area of 4u1608@xmath052 and combine these with the distance measurement to derive the mass and radius of the neutron star .",
    "4u1608@xmath052 is a transient x - ray burster that was first detected by the two vela-5 satellites ( belian , conner , & evans 1976 ) .",
    "subsequent uhuru observations confirmed the connection between the bursting and the persistent source ( tananbaum et al . 1976 ) . a more precise x - ray position , obtained with heao-1 , permitted the identification of the optical counterpart , qx normae , with an i=18.2 mag ( grindlay & liller 1978 ) .",
    "wachter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified a modulation in the optical light curve of the source with a period of 0.537 days , which they attributed to the orbital period .",
    "4u1608@xmath052 has also been observed during several outbursts with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "thirty - one type - i x - ray bursts were identified , out of which 12 were categorized as pre bursts . during several pre bursts , burst oscillations have been detected with a frequency of 619 hz , making this source one of the most rapidly rotating accreting neutron - stars ( galloway et al .",
    "2008a ) .    in  2 , we measure the galactic hydrogen column density towards the source using absorption edges of individual elements .",

    "we , therefore , begin our analysis with a measurement of the galactic x - ray absorption from high - resolution x - ray spectra .",
    "we determine the amount of the interstellar x - ray absorption by modeling the individual absorption edges of the elements ne and mg in the x - ray grating spectra of the source obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) onboard xmm - newton .",
    "this approach does not rely on an assumption of the intrinsic broadband x - ray spectrum of the source and is similar to the method previously applied to a number of lmxbs by juett et al .",

    "4u1608@xmath052 has been observed 4 times with xmm - newton .",
    "a list of these observations together with the exposure time is given in table  [ xmm_obs ] .",
    "the source was in a quiescent state during three of the four observations , rendering very low counts .",
    "in addition , due to the high energy particle background during the last observation ( obs i d : 0149180201 ) , only 5  ks of this observation were usable . even though 4u  1608@xmath052 was in an outburst during this observation , the short exposure time as well as the intrinsic spectrum of the binary prevented us from measuring the optical depths of the si , o , and fe edges .",
    "future grating observations of this source during an outburst phase would also enable a measurement of these edges .",
    "we extracted rgs spectra with the latest calibration files available ( as of 2009 march 23 ) and used the _ rgsproc _ tool within sas v.7.1.0 . by default ,",
    "the binning of x - ray grating spectra oversamples the instrumental resolution of the rgs detectors . for this reason",
    ", we rebinned the resulting spectra by a factor of 5 to match the wavelength resolution of the detector ( 0.04  ) .",
    "the resulting x - ray spectrum had approximately 300 counts at the mg edge and 40 counts at the ne edge per spectral bin . to analyze the spectra , we used xspec v12 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we modeled the ne and mg edges by fitting the x - ray spectrum in small wavelength intervals : the 8.5@xmath010.5  region for mg and the 13.0@xmath016.0  region for ne .",
    "we assumed that the spectrum in each of these intervals can be modeled with a power - law function ( @xmath9^{\\alpha}$ ] ) and modeled each edge with a function of the form    @xmath10 & { \\rm for~ } \\lambda \\leq \\lambda_{\\rm edge}. \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there are uncertainties in the positions of edges that are comparable to the resolution of the detector ( juett et al .",
    "2004 ) . because of the relatively low signal - to - noise of the data , leaving the edge positions as free parameters did not affect the results of the fits .",
    "we , therefore , fixed the edge positions at the values inferred from high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy of x - ray binaries ; i.e. , @xmath11 = 9.5  @xmath12 for mg ( ueda et al .",
    "2005 ) and 14.3  @xmath12 for ne ( juett et al .",
    "we show the spectrum and the best - fit models in figure  [ edges ] and summarize the results of the fits in table  [ edgeres ] . using the best - fit absorption coefficients and the cross - sections from gould & jung ( 1991 )",

    "we note here that the hydrogen column density inferred from an analysis of the continuum spectrum of 4u1608@xmath052 obtained from exosat observations is ( 1.0@xmath01.5 ) @xmath20  @xmath15 ( penninx et al . 1989 ) .      comparing the interstellar extinction determined from the x - ray grating spectrum with the k band extinction of red clump stars ( see  3 )",
    "requires converting the hydrogen column density to an infrared extinction @xmath6 .",
    "we carry out this conversion in two steps using empirical laws that stem from observations of large samples of sources .",
    "we first convert from @xmath21 to optical extinction @xmath22 and subsequently from @xmath22 to @xmath6 .",
    "the observed relation between hydrogen column density and optical extinction has been the subject of numerous studies ( e.g. , grenstein 1975 ; predehl & schmitt 1996 ; gver & zel 2009 ) . using a variety of x - ray sources such as supernova remnants or x - ray binaries ,",
    "the relation between @xmath21 and @xmath22 has been measured along different lines of sight .",
    "all of the studies found a relatively tight linear relationship between these quantities and none revealed any significant variation along different lines of sight .    here",
    ", we use the relation    @xmath23    ( see gver & zel 2009 and references therein ) to convert the hydrogen column density to optical extinction .",
    "this result comes from the most recent effort to quantify the a@xmath24n@xmath25 relation and is based on high - resolution spectra of 22 supernova remnants .",
    "the uncertainty in the normalization incorporates the uncertainties in the measurements of both quantities for each source and reflects also the variation along different lines of sight that is consistent with the data .",
    "this is why the uncertainty in the normalization is larger compared to previous studies despite the higher quality data used and the larger number of sources .",
    "using this conversion law , we found an optical extinction towards the x - ray binary of @xmath26  mag .",
    "we carried out the second conversion between optical and infrared extinction following the empirical relation of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . using a large sample of stars",
    ", these authors showed that _",
    "( i ) _ the extinction law is highly uniform for wavelengths greater than 0.7 microns ( where the k band lies ) , _ ( ii ) _ the extinction law depends very weakly on @xmath27 in this wavelength range , and _ ( iii ) _ it has extremely little scatter along different lines of sight .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 is found empirically to depend on the parameter @xmath27 according to the relation @xmath29 allowing the parameter @xmath30 to take values in the range @xmath31 , as in the observed sample of cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , we find that the ratio @xmath28 ranges between @xmath32 .",
    "we assume a box - car distribution for the ratio @xmath28 within this range .",
    "we found an extinction of @xmath33  mag towards 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "in order to determine the distance to 4u1608@xmath052 , we use a technique that relies on the red clump stars that are present in the field of view of the source .",
    "this method , discussed in detail in lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and cabrera - lavers , garzn , & hammersley ( 2005 ) is very reliable in deriving both the stellar number density and the interstellar extinction along a given line of sight in the galaxy .",
    "recently , a very similar method has been applied to determine the distances to some anomalous x - ray pulsars by durant & van kerkwijk ( 2006b ) .",
    "red clump giants have long been proposed as standard candles ( paczynski & stanek 1998 ) .",
    "these are core helium - burning giants with a very narrow luminosity function that constitute a compact and well - defined clump in an hertzsprung - russell diagram , particularly in the infrared .",
    "furthermore , as they are relatively luminous , they can be identified to large distances from the sun .",
    "the location of stars of the same spectral type ( i.e. , of approximately the same absolute magnitude ) in a cmd depends on distance and extinction .",
    "the effect of distance alone shifts the stars to fainter magnitudes ( vertically ) , while extinction by itself makes the stars both redder and fainter ( shifting them diagonally in the cmd ) .    the absolute magnitude ( @xmath34 ) and intrinsic color , @xmath35 , of the red clump giants are well established ( alves 2000 ; grocholski & sarajedini 2002 ; salaris & girardi 2002 ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2003 ) . here , we assume an absolute magnitude for the red clump population of @xmath36 mag and an intrinsic color of @xmath37 = 0.7 mag .",
    "these values are consistent with the results derived by alves ( 2000 ) from the _ hipparcos _ red clump data and also with the results obtained by grocholski & sarajedini ( 2002 ) for open clusters .",
    "they are also in agreement with the intrinsic colors for the red clump stars predicted by the padova isochrones in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) system ( bonatto et al .",
    "2004 ) for a 10 gyr population of solar metallicity of @xmath38 = 0.68 mag .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the red clump stars have a small dependence on metallicity ( salaris & girardi 2002 ) . for our case , this effect is negligible as there is no large metallicity gradient in the galactic disk ( ibata & gilmore 1995a , 1995b ; sarajedini , lee , & lee 1995 ) .",
    "however , the red clump star absolute magnitude in the @xmath39 band is more sensitive to metallicity and age than the @xmath40 band , hence the intrinsic color @xmath38 also depends on both the metallicity and age ( salaris & girardi 2002 ; grocholski & sarajedini 2002 ; pietrzyski et al .",
    "2003 ) . for 4u1608@xmath052 @xmath41(l=331.0@xmath42 , b=-0.9@xmath42 ) ,",
    "in particular , the maximum metallicity gradient expected in this field produces a de - reddened color of @xmath43 , considering the recent results in the metallicity for red clump giants in the inner galaxy ( [ fe / h]=-0.2 dex , gonzlez - fernndez et al .",
    "2008 ) , as well as the predictions of the theoretical isochrones of salaris & girardi ( 2002 ) and bonatto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for this range of metallicities .    in summary",
    ", the metallicity dependence leads to a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in the absolute magnitude of the red clump stars and to 0.05 mag in the intrinsic color @xmath38 ( a value that also takes into account the dispersion around the mean color of the red clump population ) .",
    "we will adopt these values when determining the systematic uncertainties in the interstellar extinction along the line of sight to 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "to apply the red clump method in the galactic field we are interested in , we first build a ( @xmath44 , @xmath40 ) cmd . in the case of 4u 1608@xmath052",
    ", we use the data from 2mass ( skrutskie et al . 2006 ) which is the most complete database of nir galactic point sources available to date .",
    "the 2mass jhk photometry is slightly shallower than that provided by the more recent ukidss _ galactic plane survey _ ( lucas et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , the latter survey has no coverage in the region where 4u1608@xmath052 lies , hence we rely on the 2mass data only .    in order to isolate the red clump sources",
    ", we use the theoretical traces to define the limits of the k - giant branch on the cmds ( see figure [ fig : cm1 ] ) .",
    "the traces are obtained for different stellar types by using a double exponential approximation to the interstellar extinction according to the updated `` sky '' model ( wainscoat et al .",
    "this very simple approach is used solely to facilitate the separation of the k - giant branch and has no effect on the final results .",
    "we then visually decide on the traces that are most useful in isolating the k - giants .",
    "our goal is to avoid any kind of contamination in the red clump counts by other star populations , mainly dwarf stars and m - giants ( see figure [ fig : cm1 ] ) .",
    "once the optimal traces have been selected , we extract the giant stars from the cmd and bin them according to their @xmath40 magnitudes . for each magnitude bin , we construct count histograms by making horizontal cuts ( i.e. , running color ) through the cmds at each range of @xmath40 magnitudes .",
    "we then fit a gaussian function    @xmath45 , \\label{ga}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the binned @xmath47 color and @xmath48 is the color of the peak , to the histogram to determine the position of the peak in each cut .",
    "figure [ fig : gauss ] shows different gaussian fits to the color histograms obtained in three different magnitude bins for the field of figure [ fig : cm1 ] . the identified maxima correspond to the red clump stars since they are by far the most prominent population ( hammersley et al .",
    "2000 ; cohen et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the fits provide simultaneously the magnitude m@xmath49 and the color @xmath44 for each maximum .",
    "we use these fits to determine the extinction a@xmath50 by tracing how the @xmath44 colors of the peaks of the red clump counts change with @xmath51 .",
    "we calculate the extinction for any given @xmath51 using the measured @xmath47 of the peak , the intrinsic mean color excess definition , and the interstellar extinction values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e.    @xmath54 , \\label{ak}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55=0.657 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ; this value is consistent with the one found by cardelli et al .",
    "we then obtain the extinction @xmath56 to a heliocentric distance @xmath57 for each field by using the usual transformation for the distance along the line of sight :    @xmath58}. \\label{r}\\ ] ]    we estimate the uncertainties in the extinction from the uncertainty of the mean color of the gaussian component    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the total number of red clump stars in each magnitude bin .",
    "this uncertainty gives an indicator of the statistical error only ; to determine the total uncertainty in the extinction , we also take into account the spread @xmath61=0.05 mag in the intrinsic color , @xmath38 , of the red clump population due to metallicity effects and add both uncertainties in quadrature :    @xmath62    we calculate the uncertainty in the distance along the line of sight by means of equation  ( [ r ] ) from : @xmath7 the dispersion in the absolute magnitude of the red clump population , @xmath8 the uncertainties in the extinction given by equation ( [ sigak ] ) , and @xmath63 the size of the binning in @xmath64 used to perform the gaussian fit of equation ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "the only restriction that has to be taken into account when applying this method is the contamination in the red clump counts due to dwarf stars , which is important at @xmath65 for in - plane fields ( lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "this imposes a limit in the distance along the line of sight up to which we can extract the interstellar extinction . for the field around 4u1608@xmath052 , this value is nearly 7.5 kpc , which turns out to be larger than the inferred distance to the source .      from the 2mass archival data , we have extracted stars in the field of view of 4u1608@xmath052 , using an interval of @xmath66=0.5@xmath42 and @xmath67=0.3@xmath42 , that gives a total number of 13202 stars . with those stars , we measured the run of reddening with distance up to @xmath687.5 kpc .    in principle , we can increase the accuracy in the determination of the extinction by enlarging the size of the region around the location of 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "this would increase the number of red clump stars , thus decreasing the uncertainty given by equation ( [ erjk ] ) . at the same time",
    ", it would allow a decrease in the bin size in magnitude @xmath64 that is used to perform the gaussian fit of equation ( [ ga ] ) , yielding a better sampling of the extinction and a higher accuracy when deriving the distance .    to do this , however",
    ", we must first ensure that there are no significant variations of extinction in the lines of sight around 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "for this purpose , we collected 2mass data in two adjacent fields to 4u1608@xmath052 , each 0.5 degrees away in longitude to the source ( we will refer to them as ` field a ' and ` field b ' ) .",
    "we find that there is no strong variation of extinction in those fields with respect to the values obtained for the field centered on 4u1608@xmath052 ( see figure [ fields ] ) .",
    "we merged all the data for the field centered on 4u1608@xmath052 , using an interval for the extraction of 2mass sources of @xmath69=1.5@xmath42 and @xmath67=0.3@xmath42 , hence covering an area of @xmath680.45 deg@xmath70 in the sky .",
    "the resulting total number of stars increased to 40548 and the uncertainties in the extinction estimates decreased by a factor of 2.5 .",

    ", we took the measurements in the 3@xmath010  s time interval after each burst started , when the apparent radius reaches a constant value , while the signal - to - noise ratio remains high .",

    "three out of the four measurements of the blackbody normalization are within 1@xmath77 , while the fourth measurement is within 2@xmath77 of the rest .",
    "this implies that all measurements are consistent with each other within their formal uncertainties . formally fitting these four values with a constant results in a blackbody normalization of @xmath84  ( km/10  kpc)@xmath70 .",
    "the distance measurement to 4u1608@xmath052 , the touchdown flux , and the blackbody normalization obtained by time - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of the bursts provide the three observables that are needed to measure independently the mass and the radius of the neutron star in this binary .",

    "in this paper , we combined a distance measurement technique , applied for the first time to a lmxb , with time - resolved spectroscopy of the type - i x - ray bursts in order to measure the mass and the radius of the neutron star in the x - ray binary 4u1608@xmath052 .",
    "there are no previous distance measurements to this binary .",
    "our analysis led to a distance of 5.8@xmath116 kpc , which , together with the galactic coordinates of the source , implies that 4u1608@xmath052 is either on the far side of the scutum - crux arm or in between the scutum - crux and norma arms . between these two galactic arms , the increase in the extinction is expected to be minor .",
    "our analysis of the run of reddening with extinction using the red clump giants along this line of sight showed this expected trend . because 4u1608@xmath052 falls in a region between the arms where the slope of the extinction curve shown in figure  [ distancetotal ] is very shallow , the errors in the distance measurement , correspondingly , are relatively large .",
    "nevertheless , a firm lower limit is achieved on the source distance .",
    "the 1- and 2-@xmath117 confidence contours of mass and radius shown in figure  [ massradius ] are based on the distance measurement and spectral analysis of the x - ray bursts observed from this source .",
    "we also find the individual probability density functions for mass and radius by marginalizing @xmath118 over radius and mass , respectively .",
    "fitting the resulting probability distributions with gaussian functions yields a mass of m  =  1.74  @xmath130.14  m@xmath2 and and a radius of r  =  9.3@xmath131.0  km , where the errors represent 1@xmath77 uncertainties .",
    "there are numerous mass measurements and estimates of isolated and binary neutron stars .",
    "dynamical mass measurements allow , in some cases , very precise determination of the neutron star masses ( see thorsett & chakrabarty 1999 for a review )",
    ". however , dynamical measurements do not reveal any information about the neutron star radii , which are better indicators of the neutron star equation of state than are masses ( zel & psaltis 2009 ) .",
    "most attempts at measuring neutron star radii result in constraints on the _ combination _ of neutron star radii and masses .",
    "such measurements have been carried out on globular cluster neutron stars in binaries emitting thermally during quiescence , such as x7 in 47  tuc and others in @xmath119  cen , m  13 , and ngc  2808 ( heinke et al .",
    "2006 ; webb & barret 2007 ) .",
    "these measurements have carved out large allowed bands in the mass - radius plane , covering the mass - radius contours of the present measurements .",
    "using multiple spectroscopic phenomena , on the other hand , leads to an independent measurement of the stellar radius and mass .",
    "zel ( 2006 ) used spectroscopic measurements of the eddington limit and apparent surface area during thermonuclear bursts , in conjunction with the detection of a redshifted atomic line from the source exo  0748@xmath0676 , to determine a mass of @xmath120 and a radius @xmath121 .",
    "zel et al ( 2009 ) applied an approach similar to the one in the current paper to a neutron star binary exo  1745@xmath0248 in the globular cluster terzan  5 and found tightly constrained pairs of values for the mass and radius , which are centered around @xmath122 and @xmath123  km or around @xmath124 and @xmath125  km .",
    "the latter two radius measurements are consistent with the one presented in the current paper to within 2@xmath77 , and , therefore , several nucleonic equations of state are consistent with both measurements",
    ".    the systematic and statistical errors on the measured masses and radii of neutron stars do not yet allow the determination of a unique equation of state for neutron star matter . however , by measuring a sufficient number of neutron stars with different masses , it is possible to trace out the mass and radius relation , which would then allow a measurement of the pressure of cold ultradense matter at densities beyond the nuclear saturation density ( zel & psaltis 2009 ) . in the present calculations ,",
    "the largest uncertainty arises from the distance measurement , due both to the particular location of the binary in the galactic disk as well as to the short exposure time of the x - ray grating observation that yields a low signal - to - noise spectrum .",
    "future x - ray grating observations of will help decrease the distance uncertainty and improve the mass and the radius measurement as well .",
