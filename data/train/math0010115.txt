    "the inner structure of hilbert spaces is easily described by fixing a basis , orthonormalizing it and working with the coordinates of every element with respect to the latter . considering finite - dimensional hilbert spaces as free @xmath0-modules one could ask whether similar generating sets of finitely generated projective c*-modules",
    "can be indicated which characterize the modules up to isomorphism .",
    "unfortunately , there are two obstacles : projective c*-modules need not to be free in general , and there does not exist any general notion of ` c*-linear independence ' of sets of generators because of the existence of zero - divisors in any non - trivial c*-algebra . beside these circumstances",
    "one does not know any canonical method to replace the process of gram - schmidt or symmetric orthogonalization of bases in the situation of sets of modular generators .    in 1997 , working with frames for hilbert spaces that arise canonically in wavelet and weyl - heisenberg / gabor frame theory , we got the idea to investigate modular frames of hilbert c*-modules over unital c*-algebras as a possible replacement for the questionable analogs of bases .",
    "this class of c*-modules includes finitely generated projective ones .",
    "the resulting theory@xcite has been encouraging because of its consistency and strength , and also because of the number of mathematical problems which can make use of it . in the field of wavelet and frame theory and",
    "its applications to signal and image processing many frames arise as the result of group actions on single functions . extending the group to its ( reduced ) group c*-algebra or to its group von neumann algebra and taking the generated frame as a generating set of a hilbert c*-module over one of these c*-algebras we are in the context in which our concept can be applied .",
    "this point of view has been of interest e.g.  to m.  a.  rieffel , to o.  bratteli and p.  e.  t.  jrgensen , and to p.  g.  casazza and m.  lammers as we know from ongoing discussions . in the literature",
    "we found other fields of applications like the description of conditional expectations of finite ( jones ) index on c*-algebras ( @xcite ) , the analysis of cuntz - krieger - pimsner algebras ( @xcite ) , the investigation of the stable rank of c*-algebras ( @xcite ) and the search for @xmath1-invariants in global analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to give a survey on our results on modular frames for hilbert c*-modules indicating their generality and strength as well as pointing out differences to the hilbert space frame theory and open problems . for full proofs and more details",
    "we refer to our basic publications ( @xcite ) . the next section we explain decomposition and reconstruction results . in the third section",
    "we deal with frame - related invariants of finitely generated projective c*-modules that characterize them up to isomorphism .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to a structure theorem on the nature of operators @xmath2 on a certain hilbert space such that @xmath3 .",
    "the last section is concerned with a discussion on various problems of frame approximation by ( normalized ) tight ones .",
    "the concept of hilbert c*-modules arose as a generalization of the notions ` hilbert space ' , ` fibre bundle ' and ` ideal ' .",
    "the basic idea has been to consider modules over arbitrary c*-algebras instead of linear spaces and to allow the inner products to take values in those c*-algebras of coefficients being c*-(anti-)linear in their arguments . for the history and for comprehensive accounts",

    "this kind of hilbert c*-modules is very important : every finitely generated hilbert @xmath4-module @xmath5 can be embedded into some hilbert @xmath4-module @xmath36 for finite @xmath37 as an orthogonal summand , and every countably generated hilbert @xmath4-module can be realized as an orthogonal summand of the hilbert @xmath4-module @xmath38 in such a way that its orthogonal complement is isometrically isomorphic to @xmath39 again , ( kasparov s theorem@xcite ) . to name two further examples ,",
    "the set of all continuous sections of a certain vector bundle over a base space @xmath28 becomes naturally a finitely generated hilbert c(@xmath28)-module , and conditional expectations on c*-algebras @xmath40 turn these c*-algebras into pre - hilbert @xmath4-modules over the image c*-subalgebra @xmath41 .",
    "( by the way , the interrelation between vector bundles and finitely generated projective c*-modules over commutative c*-algebras is a categorical equivalence similar to gelfand s theorem for c*-algebras , see serre - swan s theorem@xcite . )",

    "therefore , bounded modular operators may be non - adjointable , norm - closed hilbert @xmath4-submodules can lack the property to be direct summands , the notions of topological and orthogonal direct summands are different , and more .",
    "there are even examples of non - countably generated banach c*-modules which can be turned into hilbert c*-modules in at least two ways , however the two c*-valued inner products are not unitarily isomorphic , and so the resulting two norms give rise to non - isometrically isomorphic banach c*-modules , ( @xcite ) .",
    "luckily , the latter oddity can not appear for countably generated hilbert c*-modules . for a concrete example consider the c*-algebra @xmath42)$]of all continuous functions on the unit interval , its ideal @xmath43)$ ] of all continuous functions vanishing at zero and the hilbert @xmath4-module @xmath44 with the standard @xmath4-valued inner product inherited from @xmath45 .",
    "the operator @xmath46 is non - adjointable , and the hilbert @xmath4-submodule @xmath47 is a topological direct summand , but not an orthogonal one .    in the light of these circumstances",
    "the results on the existence and on the properties of modular frames for finitely or countably generated hilbert c*-modules presented below become the more remarkable .",

    "so standard modular frames exist in abundance in the canonical hilbert @xmath4-modules . at the same time",

    "consequently , every algebraically finitely generated or countably generated hilbert @xmath4-module @xmath5 possesses a standard normalized tight frame since they can be embedded into these standard hilbert @xmath4-modules as orthogonal summands .",

    "the best way for the description of the inner structure of hilbert spaces is the selection of a ( ( ortho- ) normal ) basis and the characterization of elements by their coordinates .",
    "the notion of a basis makes essentially use of the notion of linear independence of vectors . turning to finitely generated projective c*-modules over a certain fixed unital c*-algebra @xmath4 we are most often faced with the absence of a reasonable notion of @xmath4-linear independence of sets of module elements , e.g.  finite sets of algebraic generators . also , very often we have a lot of non - isomorphic @xmath4-modules possessing generating sets with the same number of algebraic generators .",

    "the latter inner product is unique as shown by corollary 4.3 , theorem 6.1@xcite and theorem 4.4@xcite .",

    "example 1.1@xcite .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath147 can be non - trivial even if @xmath146 for any index @xmath148 since every non - trivial c*-algebra @xmath4 contains zero - divisors . not every hilbert c*-module with a normalized tight modular frame does possess a modular riesz basis .",

    "also the projection @xmath277 plays an important role .    looking through the literature",
    "there are two approaches to this problem , one due to r.  balan@xcite and the other due to v.  i.  paulsen , t.  r.  tiballi@xcite and the first author@xcite .",
    "r.  balan@xcite starts with the definition of three distance measures for pairs of frames : the frame @xmath74 of the hilbert space @xmath31 is said to be _ quadratically close _ to the frame @xmath278 of @xmath31 if there exists a non - negative number @xmath52 such that the inequality @xmath279 is satisfied .",
    "the infimum of all such constants @xmath52 is denoted by @xmath280 . in general , if @xmath281 then @xmath282 , however this distance measure is not reflexive .",

    "they are near if and only if they are similar , ( th .",
    "2.4@xcite ) .",
    "the distance measure @xmath284 is an equivalence relation and fulfils the triangle inequality .",
    "3.1@xcite ) for a given frame @xmath74 of @xmath31 with frame bounds @xmath140 the distance measures admit their infima at @xmath285 these values are achieved by the tight frames @xmath286{cd } s^{1/2}(x_i ) \\}_i    \\ , , \\ ] ] listed in the same order as the measures above .",
    "the solution may not be unique , in general , however any tight frame @xmath278 of @xmath31 that achieves the minimum of one of the three distance measures @xmath280 , @xmath287 and @xmath284 is unitarily equivalent to the corresponding solutions listed above .",
    "the difference of the connecting unitary operator and the product of minimal distance times either @xmath288 or @xmath289 fulfils a certain measure - specific operator norm equality which can be found at th .",
    "we point out that the first constant at ( [ eqn1 ] ) is the arithmetic mean of @xmath290 and @xmath291 , the second one is their harmonic mean and the third one is their geometrical mean .",
    "2.3@xcite ) the operator @xmath292 is hilbert - schmidt if and only if the sum @xmath293 is finite for at least one normalized tight frame @xmath294 of a hilbert subspace @xmath295 of @xmath31 that is similar to @xmath74 . in this situation",
    "the estimate @xmath296 is valid for every normalized tight frame @xmath294 of any hilbert subspace @xmath295 of @xmath31 that is similar to @xmath74 , where @xmath297 denotes the hilbert - schmidt norm .",

    "equality appears if and only if @xmath298 for any @xmath299 .",
    "consequently , _ the symmetric approximation of a frame @xmath74 in a hilbert space @xmath267 _ is the normalized tight frame @xmath300 spanning the same hilbert subspace @xmath301 of @xmath31 and being similar to @xmath74 via the invertible operator @xmath289 .",
    "applying the theorem to appropriate riesz bases @xmath74 the normalized tight frame @xmath300 turns out to be the symmetric orthogonalization of this basis as discovered by p .- o .",
    "lwdin@xcite in 1948 .",
    "this is why the denotation ` symmetric approximation ' has been selected for the normalized tight frame @xmath300 .",
    "the resultsin ( @xcite ) generalize to modular frames of countably generated hilbert c*-modules over commutative c*-algebras , whereas for respective hilbert c*-modules over non - commutative c*-algebras the proofs can not reproduced at several crucial places where commutativity of the c*-algebra of coefficients is essential .",
    "so the formulation of propositions on the non - commutative case is an open problem at present .    to overcome the difficulties with the non - commutativity of the c*-algebra of coefficients we consider distance - measures based on the various frame operators .",
    "the properties of these operators do not depend on the choice of the set of coefficients ( @xcite ) .",
    "one idea could be to consider the distance with respect to the operator norm of the difference of the orthogonal projections @xmath302 onto the ranges of the frame transforms of two given frames @xmath74 and @xmath278 .",
    "unfortunately , two frames of a certain hilbert space @xmath31 are similar if and only if these projections coincide ( th .  7.2@xcite ) .",
    "so we would only characterize classes of similar frames .",
    "the better idea is to consider the operator norm distance of the respective frame transforms @xmath303 , @xmath304 or of the respective frame operators @xmath305 , @xmath306 .",
    "the latter act as positive diagonalizable operators on the given hilbert c*-module , whereas the former map it to the standard countably generated hilbert c*-module @xmath79 .",
    "for any tight frame @xmath278 of a hilbert space @xmath31 the corresponding frame operator @xmath306 equals to the identity operator times the frame bound value . for a given frame @xmath74 of @xmath31 with frame bounds",
    "@xmath140 the closest positive multiple of the identity operator to the frame operator @xmath305 is @xmath307 .",
    "unfortunately , every tight frame @xmath278 of @xmath31 with frame bound @xmath308 fulfils this condition , and the relative position of tight frames in @xmath31 is of greater importance than one can express that way .",
    "however , we got a hint for the kind of factor to be used",
    ". now , let us consider the norm of differences of frame transforms .",
    "let @xmath74 be a frame of a certain hilbert space @xmath31 with frame bounds @xmath140 , and let @xmath95 be its frame operator .",
    "the frame transform @xmath309 of the tight frame @xmath310 is the closest one w.r.t .",
    "the operator norm to the frame transform @xmath303 of the given frame @xmath74 among all the frame transforms of positive multiples of the normalized tight frame @xmath300 .",
    "denote the frame transform of the tight frame @xmath311 by @xmath312 for @xmath313 .",
    "because the frame transforms @xmath312 and @xmath309 all possess the same coisometries in their respective polar decompositions we obtain the equality @xmath314 . since the inequality @xmath315 is valid and both @xmath316 and @xmath289 are diagonalizable with a common set of eigenvectors that forms a basis of @xmath31 we obtain @xmath317 the right expression is minimal if and only if @xmath318 is the arithmetic mean of the lower and the upper spectral bound @xmath290 and @xmath291 of the positive invertible operator @xmath289",
    ".    suppose the frame @xmath74 of a certain hilbert space @xmath31 is fixed and possesses the frame bounds @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "let us consider tight frames @xmath319 of @xmath31 with frame bound @xmath320 for which the norm of the difference of their frame transform @xmath304 and of the frame transform @xmath309 of the tight frame @xmath321 is small .",
    "the next example shows that there are usually a lot of quite different tight frames of @xmath31 with frame bound @xmath320 the frame transforms of which realize the same norm distance to the frame transform @xmath303 of the initial frame as the distinguished tight frame @xmath322 of @xmath31 .",
    "we want to point out that the example works already for finite - dimensional hilbert spaces and for frames with finitely many elements .",
    "let @xmath323 be a separable hilbert space and fix its standard orthonormal basis @xmath269 .",
    "set @xmath324 , @xmath325 and @xmath326 for @xmath327 .",
    "the resulting set @xmath74 is a riesz basis of @xmath31 with frame bounds @xmath328 and @xmath329 . since @xmath330 we can consider other tight frames @xmath278 of @xmath31 with the same frame bound @xmath331 that are defined as @xmath332 for @xmath333 and @xmath334 for some @xmath335 . obviously , @xmath336 for @xmath337 and @xmath338 , where @xmath339 maps @xmath340 to @xmath341 , @xmath342 and @xmath77 is the identity map . since both @xmath289 and @xmath339",
    "are normal , diagonalizable and commuting , with a basis consisting of common eigenvectors @xmath269 , we can estimate @xmath343 see e.  a.  azoff and c.  davis@xcite , or k.  r.  davidson@xcite . the eigenvalues can be counted , they are @xmath344 and @xmath345 for @xmath333 and @xmath346 .",
    "taking the concrete values from the definitions of both the frames we obtain that the maximum of the difference of the corresponding eigenvalues is determined by the first two terms as long as @xmath347 .",
    "so all these tight frames @xmath278 parametrized by @xmath348 realize the same norm @xmath349 for the difference of the respective frame transforms .    summarizing",
    ", the measure of nearness of a frame to some tight frame derived from the norm of the difference of their frame transforms in general gives an entire manifold of tight frames that are ` closest ' to a given frame with respect to this measure .",
    "moreover , if we allow the tight frame to span a probably smaller hilbert space than the original frame @xmath74 , then the condition @xmath350 to the frame bounds @xmath140 of @xmath74 turns out to be occasionally essential to guarantee that the closest tight frame spans exactly the same hilbert space than the initial frame . in other words ,",
    "the distance between the square root of the lower frame bound @xmath52 and the arithmetic mean of the square roots of the lower and the upper frame bounds @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , has to be smaller than the distance of the square root of @xmath52 to zero .    the problem stated in the beginning of the present section remains unsolved despite of the encouraging partial results indicated above , even for the approximation of frames of hilbert spaces by ( normalized ) tight ones .",
    "we will continue our work to find a solution for it .",
