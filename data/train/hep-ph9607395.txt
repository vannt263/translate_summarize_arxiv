    "we have demonstrated recently  @xcite that it is possible to regulate the relative contributions of different reaction mechanisms in the exclusive high energy hard @xmath6 reaction , by selecting specific kinematical conditions . in that paper",
    "we discussed this reaction within the kinematics that is preferential to the study of short range nucleon correlations in the deuteron , the role of relativistic effects in the deuteron structure and the effects of nucleon binding .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyze the reaction in the kinematics favorable for the search of the color transparency ( ct ) phenomenon .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite that , under certain kinematical conditions , initial and final state interactions can dominate the cross sections .",
    "those same kinematics can be advantageous for studying ct by the vanishing initial ( isi ) and final ( fsi ) state interactions of hadronic products in the hard exclusive @xmath7 scattering .",
    "( for details on ct physics , see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . as a first step for the identification of ct",
    "it is necessary to develop a baseline model which accounts for the initial and final state interactions within the conventional eikonal approximation .",
    "thus , in this paper , we first restrict our considerations by calculating the elastic rescatterings of nucleons only .",
    "next we will include the inelastic production in the intermediate states in terms of ct .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the high momentum transfer exclusive deuteron electro - disintegration reaction has been calculated within the eikonal approximation .",
    "the calculation of the feynman diagrams , relevant for the propagation of knocked out energetic nucleons through the nuclear medium , revealed certain effects related to the finite longitudinal distances , which are beyond the formulae of conventional glauber approximation@xcite .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to extend the formalism of ref.@xcite to account for similar effects in the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "another motivation of our study is to understand the unexpected energy dependence of the semi - inclusive @xmath8 reaction . in the energy range up to the @xmath9 , carroll et al .",
    "ref.@xcite found that , in semi - inclusive @xmath10 reactions , the absorption of protons was reduced compared to the value predicted in the glauber approximation . at incident",
    "proton energies larger than @xmath9 an increase in the absorption was observed .",
    "that result led to a number of theoretical suggestions , such as the possible importance of the interference between interactions of point like- and large size configurations @xcite , the longitudinal momentum dependence of nuclear transparency at pre - asymptotic energies@xcite , the possible existence of a threshold for charmed particle production @xcite , etc . exploring",
    "the deuteron in the above energy range and restricting the kinematics to where the deuteron wave function is well known , may help to elucidate the physics of hadron propagation through the nuclear medium and the energy dependence of the semi - inclusive reaction .    as a definition for hard @xmath1 collision in the exclusive @xmath0 reaction we choose the conditions of large center of mass angle ( @xmath11 ) @xmath1 scatterings with @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "we restrict the calculations to momenta of the incoming proton @xmath15 , where a reliable parameterization for hard @xmath1 scattering exists ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we deduce eikonal formulae of the scattering process by analyzing the feynman diagrams corresponding to the single and double rescatterings(see fig.1 ) . at the present kinematical conditions",
    "the nonrelativistic deuteron wave function has been used but the full relativistic kinematics of the interaction is taken into account by the feynman diagram approach . at intermediate energies we account for relativistic kinematics exactly ,",
    "i.e. we keep also terms @xmath16 whose contributions are enhanced due to the steep momentum dependence of the deuteron wave function .",
    "we make the approximation that the momentum of the fast nucleon is almost conserved in elastic high energy soft(small angle ) collisions .",
    "thus , the hard process kinematics are not strongly influenced by isi and fsi ( see appendix b ) .    in section 2",
    "we outline the details of the calculation , and explain the difference between our results and the nonrelativistic glauber approximation .",
    "the results can be used to calculate nucleon rescatterings off any nucleus . for the deuteron",
    "we calculate analytically the scattering amplitudes , using the known ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) parameterization of the wave function in momentum space .    in section 3 we present the results of numerical calculations for the kinematical conditions that can be reached in the eva experiment at bnl@xcite .",
    "the results reveal a strong impact of initial and final state interactions on the angular and momentum dependences of the differential cross sections .",
    "a surprising prediction is the azimuthal dependence of the final state interaction , which is a consequence of the interplay between hard @xmath1 scattering and soft @xmath17 rescatterings .",
    "we analyze also the range of applicability of the commonly used factorization of hard and soft scattering amplitudes . in section 3",
    "we estimate the size of expected ct effects and suggest new options for the search for various consequences of ct .",
    "the simultaneous observation of all effects will make it possible to reach unambiguous conclusions about the onset of ct .",
    "the results will be summarized in section 4 .    in appendix",
    "a the analytical calculation of the rescattering amplitude for the deuteron is presented . in appendix",
    "b we estimate the distortion of the kinematics of hard processes due to soft @xmath18 rescatterings .",
    "in this section we calculate the cross section for the @xmath0 reaction in the kinematics where the deuteron is at rest and the @xmath1 scattering is `` hard '' .",
    "the kinematics of the reaction is determined by the four - momenta @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 of the deuteron , incoming and scattered protons and spectator neutron , respectively ( c.f .",
    "we define also the variable @xmath24 , which is convenient for the description of high energy processes .",

    "the light cone momentum of the target proton is @xmath29 .",

    "we restrict the kinematical region to relatively small spectator neutron momenta i.e. @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it was shown in ref.(@xcite ) that vacuum ( @xmath42)-type diagrams in the @xmath0 reaction can be neglected under those conditions . by restricting the calculation to this range of fermi momenta we can also neglect the contribution from possible non - nucleonic components in the deuteron wave function . as a result it is safe to use a conventional non - relativistic deuteron wave function ( see e.g. refs.(@xcite ) .",
    "fig.1 depicts all the relevant feynman diagrams for the impulse approximation and for the initial and final state interactions , when the soft rescatterings are calculated within the elastic eikonal approximation .",
    "the solid circles in the diagrams represent the hard @xmath1 scattering amplitude and the broken lines represent the amplitude of small angle elastic nn scattering .",
    "note that , in eikonal approximation , there can be no contribution from diagrams where a fast proton experiences soft rescatterings off both target proton and slow spectator neutron .",
    "this is due to the finite longitudinal distance between the target proton and neutron and the fact that the sequence of the projectile proton colliding off the target proton and neutron , followed by a hard @xmath1 scattering is geometrically impossible .",
    "similarly , it is easy to demonstrate that only diagrams of fig.1 survive within a eikonal approximation .",
    "a similar cancelation of diagrams is well known in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics where infinite series over exchange by potential are reduced , in the high energy limit , to the diagrams expressed through the full amplitudes of nn scattering@xcite .",
    "we can classify the feynman diagrams in fig.1 by the number of soft initial and final state interactions .",
    "the simplest amplitude is the impulse approximation amplitude of fig.1a . that can be written as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the amplitude of the hard @xmath1 scattering and @xmath45 is the nonrelativistic deuteron wave function normalized as @xmath46 .",
    "we are interested in the cross section on a deuteron normalized to the @xmath1 cross section at the same @xmath47 and @xmath48 , so that the hard @xmath1 scattering amplitude is cancelled out .      in the eikonal approximation the first order rescattering is described by the diagrams of fig.1b , c , d . the single rescattering amplitude ( fig .",
    "1b ) can be parameterized as follows : @xmath49 [ p'^2_s - m^2+i\\epsilon][(p_4 + p_s - p'_s)^2 - m^2 +   i\\epsilon ] } { d^4p'_s\\over i(2\\pi)^4 } , \\label{eq.4}\\ ] ] where , in the intermediate state , @xmath50 is the momentum of the spectator neutron , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the invariant vertex of the transitions @xmath53 into two off - mass shell nucleons and @xmath54 is the spin dependent amplitude of @xmath17 soft scattering .",
    "all spin dependences of the target nucleons is included in the vertex factor .",
    "we factorize the hard scattering amplitude @xmath44 out of the integral because the transferred momenta in soft rescattering are negligible compared to the transferred momentum of the hard amplitude ( the validity of this approximation is discussed in appendix b ) .",
    "it is reasonable to neglect also the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath56 ( see c.f .",
    "@xcite ) because , at high energies , the @xmath18 interaction depends only weakly on the collision energy .",
    "using a non - relativistic description of the fermi motion in the deuteron allows us to evaluate the loop integral by taking the residue over the spectator nucleon energy in the intermediate state i.e. we can replace @xmath57^{-1}d^0p'_s$ ] by @xmath58 .",
    "this is possible because in this case it is the only pole in the lower part of the @xmath56 complex plane .",
    "the calculation of the residue in @xmath56 fixes the time ordering from left to right in diagram fig.1b .",

    "\\label{eq.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we use the fact that the energy transferred in the @xmath17 rescattering is negligible compared to the total energy of the scattered particles so that we may neglect the term : @xmath65 with respect to the other two contributions to @xmath66 .    we keep the term @xmath67 because it does not vanish with the increase of the projectile energy at fixed spectator nucleon momentum .",
    "we also keep the term @xmath68 which decreases only as @xmath69 according to eq.([eq.2 ] ) .",
    "if the projectile energy is not extremely large , the contribution of this term in some kinematical conditions can be comparable in size to the first term of eq.([eq.6 ] ) .",
    "the fact that the soft @xmath18 scattering amplitude depends only weakly on the initial energy helps to simplify eq.([eq.5 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to redefine the soft scattering amplitude : @xmath70 , where @xmath54 is now the scattering amplitude normalized by the optical theorem @xmath71 .",
    "we may neglect the longitudinal momentum transfer in @xmath72 and assume that the transferred momenta are almost transverse : i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "approximating the transferred longitudinal momenta , as @xmath74 and using the fact that in the rescattering integral the average transferred momenta in the @xmath17 scattering are @xmath75 , we see that the condition @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) allows us to neglect the longitudinal momentum transfer in the soft scattering amplitude .",
    "therefore , under our kinematical conditions , eq.([eq.5 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath78 } { d^3p'_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } , \\label{eq.8}\\ ] ]    the integration in eq.([eq.8 ] ) can be performed in coordinate space .",
    "writing the fourier transform of the deuteron wave function as : @xmath79 and using the coordinate space representation of the nucleon propagator : @xmath80 }   =   -i\\int d z^0 \\theta(z^0 ) e^ { i ( p'_{sz}- p_{sz } + \\delta_4 ) z^0 } \\label{eq.10}\\ ] ] we obtain the formula for the rescattering amplitude : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "we define a generalized profile function @xmath84 : @xmath85 eq.([eq.11 ] ) reduces to a glauber - type approximation in the limit of zero longitudinal momentum transfer @xmath66 . the dependence of the profile function on the longitudinal momentum transfer originates from two sources . according to eqs.([eq.6],[eq.7 ] ) the term @xmath67 accounts for the relativistic kinematics which follows from the evaluation of the propagator of a proton with momentum @xmath63 .",
    "a similar factor was found also for the @xmath86 reaction in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath87 is due to a slight misalignment of the projectile momentum with the directions of the outgoing protons .",
    "even though , according to eq.([eq.2 ] ) , this factor is small it has a large effect on the cross section due to the steep momentum dependence of the deuteron wave function ( see discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "the same modified profile function , eq.([eq.12 ] ) , is valid for the single rescattering amplitudes off any nucleus @xmath88@xcite .",
    "the unique feature for the deuteron is the possibility to calculate the rescattering amplitudes using an analytical parameterization of the deuteron wave function ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    substituting the deuteron wave function in eq.([eq.8 ] ) by the analytic form of eqs.([eq.b13 ] ) , ( [ eq.b14 ] ) and ( [ eq.b15 ] ) , one can perform the integration over @xmath89 by deforming the contour of integration in the upper complex half - plane of @xmath89 .",
    "we can then evaluate the integral by taking residues over corresponding poles in the deuteron wave function .",
    "the answer ( see appendix a for details ) for the single rescattering amplitude @xmath90 ( eq.([eq.8 ] ) ) is : @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 is deuteron wave function defined in eq.([eq.b13 ] ) and @xmath94 is defined in eqs.([eq.b19 ] ) and ( [ eq.b20 ] ) .",
    "we can now calculate also the amplitude corresponding to the diagram of fig.1c , replacing @xmath95 .",
    "thus @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is described by eq.([eq.6 ] ) with the substitution @xmath95 .    the initial state interaction represented by diagram fig1.d .",
    "is described by an equation similar to eq.([eq.8 ] ) : @xmath99 }   { d^3p'_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } , \\label{eq.22}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 is defined by eq.([eq.6 ] ) with the substitution @xmath101 .",
    "in contrast to eq.([eq.8 ] ) the singularity of the propagator in eq.([eq.22 ] ) is now located in the upper part of the complex @xmath89 plane .",
    "it is easy to show that , in coordinate space , this difference corresponds to the reverse sign of the argument of @xmath102 function in eq.([eq.10 ] ) : @xmath103 . in momentum space ,",
    "the contour of the @xmath89 integration can be deformed in the lower complex semi - plane , where the only pole is due to singularities in the deuteron wave function at @xmath104 ( see appendix a ) and the result of the integration differs from eq.([eq.18 ] ) by the sign of @xmath89 only .",
    "thus the amplitude for diagram fig.1d is given by : @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "the second order rescatterings where both protons scatter off the spectator neutron are represented in the diagrams of fig .",
    "1e , f , g and h. using the same approach as for the single rescattering , the double rescattering amplitude of fig.1e can be written as : @xmath107 }    { f^{pn}(p_{st}-p^{(2)}_{st})\\over   [ p^{(2)}_{sz}- p_{sz } + \\delta_3   + i\\epsilon ] } { d^3p^{(1)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } { d^3 p^{(2)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } \\label{eq.24}\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the spectator ( neutron ) momenta before the first and second rescatterings , respectively .    since the deuteron wave function in eq.([eq.24 ] )",
    "does not dependent on @xmath109 , the whole dependence on @xmath110 is contained in the two propagators only .",
    "but the poles of these propagators in the @xmath110 complex plane are located in the lower semi - plane . due to fast convergence of the integral",
    ", the contour of integration can be moved to the upper complex semi - plane which makes the integral equal to @xmath111 . in the coordinate space",
    "this result has a simple geometrical interpretation .",
    "the diagram describes an interaction of incoming and scattered protons with a spectator neutron which would be located simultaneously before and after the target proton which is not possible geometrically . indeed using the coordinate representation of the deuteron wave function ( eq.([eq.9 ] ) ) and the nucleon propagators ( eq.([eq.10 ] ) )",
    ", we can obtain the @xmath112 term in the integrand in the coordinate space .",
    "the same reasoning leads also to zero for the amplitudes of diagrams fig 1.f , which can be obtained from diagram fig 1.e by substituting @xmath113 .",
    "the amplitude in diagram fig .",
    "1 g , within the approximations discussed above takes on the form : @xmath114 }    { f^{pn}(p_{st}-p^{(2)}_{st})\\over   [ p^{(2)}_{sz}- p_{sz } + \\delta_4   + i\\epsilon ] } { d^3p^{(1)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 }   { d^3 p^{(2)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^3 } \\label{eq.25}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are different from those for single rescattering ( eq.([eq.6 ] ) ) .",
    "however , in our kinematics @xmath117 and @xmath98 , @xmath66 can be taken to be the same as for single rescattering . using eqs.([eq.9 ] ) and eq.([eq.10 ] )",
    "one can write the amplitude , in coordinate representation , as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is defined by eq.([eq.12 ] ) .",
    "the difference between eq.([eq.26 ] ) and the conventional nonrelativistic glauber approximation is the presence of the terms @xmath98 , @xmath66 .",
    "the integration in eq.([eq.25 ] ) over the longitudinal components of nucleon momenta @xmath120 and @xmath110 in the intermediate states can be evaluated by the technique used in sec.2.2 for the calculation of the single rescattering amplitude(see appendix a ) .",
    "first , we integrate over @xmath110 by closing the contour of integration at one of the poles in the complex plane ( they are located now in different semi - planes ) to obtain : @xmath121 }   f^{pn } ( k^{(2)}_t )   { d^2k^{(1)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^2}{dp^{(1)}_{sz}\\over 2\\pi } { d^2 k^{(2)}_s\\over ( 2\\pi)^2 } \\label{eq.27}\\ ] ] the @xmath120 integration in eq.([eq.27 ] ) can be performed in a way similar to the one used in eq.([eq.8 ] ) for @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , we may use the result of the calculation of single rescattering to obtain : @xmath123 where @xmath124 .",
    "the expression is symmetric under interchange of @xmath125 .",
    "thus , for the amplitude of diagram fig1.g",
    "we get : @xmath126      in the approximation where the hard @xmath1 scattering amplitude is factorized ( appendix",
    "b ) the cross section of the @xmath0 reaction can be written in a form which is similar to the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "hence the cross section for @xmath0 reaction can be expressed as follows ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "the function @xmath129 describes the distorted momentum dependence of a nucleon in the deuteron : @xmath130 the factor @xmath131 follows from the phase space factor of the spectator nucleon wave function . in eq([eq.30 ] ) we neglected the virtuality of the interacting nucleon and used for @xmath132 the experimentally measured cross section and for which a phenomenological parameterization is given in refs.@xcite .",
    "we wish to calculate the quantity @xmath133- `` transparency '' which accounts for the effects due to soft rescatterings .",
    "traditionally ( see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath133 is defined as the ratio of the experimentally measured cross section to the calculated ia cross section , which according to our definitions is : @xmath134 for our numerical estimates we will use the kinematics of on - shell @xmath135 center of mass angle @xmath1 scattering . this is achieved by imposing the condition @xmath136 on @xmath137 and @xmath138 :      we shall call `` elastic eikonal '' , the approximation where nucleons only propagate through the deuteron and soft @xmath17 rescatterings are described by the diffractive @xmath54 scattering amplitude . since in the relevant kinematics the amplitude @xmath54 is predominantly imaginary , the ia ( eq.([eq.3 ] ) ) and double rescattering amplitudes ( eq.([eq.28 ] ) ) are positive , while the single rescattering amplitudes ( eqs([eq.18 ] ) , ( [ eq.21 ] ) , ( [ eq.23 ] ) ) are negative .",
    "therefore the terms in eq.([eq.32 ] ) have different signs and , depending on the kinematics , the soft rescattering terms can either increase or decrease the transparency @xmath133 , leading to large isi / fsi effects on the overall cross section . in refs.@xcite,@xcite we demonstrated that the isi / fsi is largest for perpendicular kinematics , where the polar angle of the neutron-@xmath139 is almost perpendicular to the reaction axis . in fig.2",
    "we show the spectator angular ( @xmath139 ) dependence of the transparency @xmath133 , for different spectator momenta @xmath140 .",
    "the calculation was done by adopting the standard parameterization for the diffractive @xmath17 scattering amplitude : @xmath141 in our kinematics , the parameter values @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 were obtained by fitting the experimental @xmath17 scattering data@xcite .",
    "the rather weak dependence of @xmath145 and @xmath146 on the nucleon momentum , for energies above @xmath147 , has been included .",
    "the results , presented in fig.2 , confirm the large isi / fsi effects in perpendicular kinematics .",
    "they reveal also the importance of the above discussed modifications in the conventional glauber approximation@xcite .",
    "we find that the dominant effect is due to non - zero transverse momenta of the emerging fast protons ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "this effect reduces strongly the contribution from the interference of two rescattering amplitudes . but",
    "@xmath149 is not very small , large effects of rescattering are expected .",
    "the deuteron wave function in the rescattering amplitude depends on @xmath150 so the average transferred momenta in the rescattering integral are @xmath151 .",
    "the modification due to the @xmath66 and @xmath98 factors leads to the condition that a maximal rescattering occurs at @xmath152 and @xmath153 for the amplitudes @xmath90 and @xmath154 respectively . since for @xmath135 cm @xmath1 scattering @xmath155 these conditions separate the kinematical regions where rescattering contributions are maximal and therefore the maxima of @xmath90 and @xmath154 are at different @xmath156 . as a result",
    "the interference terms between contributions of different rescattering amplitudes are reduced . ] in fig.3 we show the @xmath149 dependence of @xmath133 at fixed value of @xmath157 .",
    "it follows from this figure that in the range @xmath158 the isi and fsi significantly screen the cross section .",
    "it is small compared to the cross section calculated within the ia approximation .",
    "the interference between single rescattering and the ia term dominates the overall scattering amplitude . with increasing @xmath149 @xmath159 the squared terms and the interferences between single rescattering amplitudes",
    "dominate and as a result @xmath133 may exceed @xmath160 . at even higher @xmath149 the second order ( negative ) terms in eq.([eq.32 ] ) ( e.g. interference between single and double rescattering terms ) tend to suppress the rise of @xmath133 , thus changing the slope of the @xmath149 dependence .",
    "since at fixed @xmath161 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 depends on the incoming proton energy ( see eq.([eq.2 ] ) ) , the formulae of eikonal approximation could lead to some energy dependence of t for fixed spectator momentum , even if @xmath162 , @xmath146 were energy independent .",
    "this dependence is more noticeable for the larger momenta of the spectator , since the contribution from isi / fsi diagrams increases with increasing @xmath149 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "in fact , we see in fig.4 that @xmath133 does not depend much on incident beam energy",
    ".    another nontrivial consequence of the interplay of hard @xmath1 scattering and soft @xmath17 rescattering is the dependence of fsi on the azimuthal angle of the spectator neutron .",
    "the effect is due to two important features of the reaction : in hard @xmath1 scatterings protons are produced at small but finite @xmath37 and @xmath38 angles ( lab ) and high energy soft @xmath17 rescattering is characterized by an average transferred momentum @xmath163 , which is perpendicular to the trajectory of the protons . to visualize the origin of the azimuthal dependence",
    "let us compare the kinematics when the spectator has @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( in plane kinematics ) and when @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath167 ( out of plane kinematics ) .",
    "estimating the contribution of fsi amplitude from rescattering diagrams fig.1b , c it is easy to show that the difference between the @xmath168 for eq.([eq.21 ] ) is : @xmath169^{(in \\ plane ) } - [ \\tilde p^2_s]^{(out \\ plane)}\\approx   \\delta_4 ^ 2 ( \\delta_3 ^ 2)\\approx < k^2>{2m\\over p_1 }   \\sim <",
    "p_t^2>{2m\\over p_1}. \\label{azim}\\ ] ] since the deuteron wave function depends strongly on momentum , the difference in the argument of the wave function leads to a significant effect in the dependence on azimuthal angle .",
    "therefore the fsi interaction for out - of - plane kinematics is larger than for in - plane kinematics .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.5 where the @xmath30 dependence of transparency @xmath133 is calculated at @xmath164 for different values of the spectator transverse momenta @xmath149 .",
    "let us discuss briefly the reliability of the derived picture within the eikonal approximation .",
    "the effects of the order of ( @xmath170 ) are included in the argument of the deuteron wave function . in perpendicular kinematics",
    "the deuteron wave function is sensitive to the momentum @xmath171 .",
    "thus @xmath170 effects are amplified by the steep momentum dependence of the deuteron wave function at small momenta . in ref.@xcite",
    "we demonstrated that the off - shell effects are minimal for the perpendicular kinematics since the @xmath47 dependence of the hard @xmath1 scattering in this case is minimal .",
    "for the kinematics where soft rescatterings dominate ( at @xmath172 ) , the calculations are practically insensitive to relativistic effects in the deuteron wave function  @xcite .",
    "a practical conclusion is that the kinematical restriction @xmath173 and @xmath174 opens a possibility to investigate reliably effects which are sensitive to initial and final state interactions of energetic protons with the slow spectator neutron .",
    "another important question is the validity of the factorization of hard and soft scatterings .",
    "we demonstrate in appendix b that the errors due to this factorization are minimal for small values of the spectator transverse momenta and @xmath175 .",
    "the numerical estimates of the errors are shown in fig.12 , which shows that , in the region of @xmath176 and @xmath177 , the factorization approximation is valid within an accuracy of better than @xmath178 for energies @xmath15 .",
    "the accuracy improves at higher incident energies ( as shown in fig.12 , for calculations at @xmath179 and @xmath180 . )",
    "the aim of the paper is to explore whether the hard exclusive @xmath0 reaction can initiate effects of color transparency .",
    "the main idea is that at the point of interaction the hadrons of the hard elastic scattering are in a `` point like '' configuration ( plc ) whose subsequent strong interaction is reduced.@xcite . as a result",
    "soft interactions shortly before and after the hard collision will be lower than the usual strong interaction of hadrons . since",
    "a plc , produced in the hard process , is not an eigenstate of the qcd hamiltonian but rather a wave - packet of destructively interfering mass states , it has to evolve eventually into a final hadron state . due to time dilation , the characteristic distances for the evolution of a plc to the normal hadronic state increases with the total energy of the plc .",
    "the exclusive @xmath0 reaction has several features which are very sensitive to ct .",
    "since isi / fsi occur at internucleon distances in the deuteron of about @xmath181@xcite , one can use the spectator neutron to tag the plc at an early stage of evolution thus reducing expansion effects . as a result",
    ", large ct effects can be expected even at comparatively low energies .",
    "large spectator momenta @xmath182 with @xmath172 ensure small impact parameters for soft @xmath17 rescatterings .",
    "this will enhance the isi / fsi contribution to the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "we calculate @xmath133 of eq.([eq.32 ] ) in a model which accounts for plc formation and its time development in the framework of the quantum diffusion model ( qdm)@xcite . we note that ct in the resonance basis representation of plc@xcite predicts rather similar effects@xcite .",
    "we follow the procedure described in ref.@xcite to calculate the @xmath17 scattering amplitude and profile function of eq.([eq.12 ] ) ) within qdm@xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 scattering amplitude @xmath54 in eq.([eq.11 ] ) , ( [ eq.21 ] ) , ( [ eq.23 ] ) , and ( [ eq.26 ] ) is replaced by a position dependent one : @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the sachs form factor , @xmath185 is the effective total cross section of the interaction of the plc at distance @xmath186 from the interaction point . according to ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath187 where @xmath188 , with @xmath189 . here",
    "@xmath190 represents the transverse size of the initially produced configuration .",
    "theoretical analysis of realistic models of a nucleon indicate@xcite that this size is rather small even for @xmath191 .",
    "any effects of interplay between large and small size configurations can be included in a rather straightforward manner@xcite .",
    "however our aim here is primarily to demonstrate sensitivity to ct .",
    "the qdm calculation should be compared with the elastic eikonal calculation of the previous section , where @xmath17 soft rescattering was taken to be practically energy independent ( see eq.([eq.33 ] ) ) . in order to emphasize any color transparency effects , we calculate again the dependence of @xmath133 on the spectator transverse momentum , azimuthal angle and incoming proton momentum , since we showed in sec.3.1 that all these quantities are rather sensitive to the soft @xmath17 interactions . in fig.6 , we present the @xmath149 dependence of @xmath133 ( eq.([eq.32 ] ) ) calculated in the eikonal model with eq.([eq.33 ] ) and in the qdm for the rescattering amplitude with eqs.([eq.34],[eq.35 ] ) .",
    "the shaded areas correspond to the range of the parameter @xmath192 which characterizes the scale of excitation energies in plc and which controls the distance over which the plc evolves to the normal hadronic state .",
    "large values of @xmath193 correspond to small deviations from the elastic eikonal prediction .",
    "fig.6 also shows that , at fixed initial energy , ct effects become more prominent with increasing @xmath149 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the contribution of the ia amplitude is small and the soft rescatterings occur at small internucleon distances leading to some suppression in expansion of plc .",
    "also , higher order rescatterings are more important at larger @xmath149 .",
    "they are proportional to higher powers of @xmath194 and therefore should be more suppressed by the onset of ct .",
    "the dependence of @xmath133 on the azimuthal angle of the spectator , in the @xmath164 kinematics , is shown in fig.7 .",
    "the isi ( fig.1d ) does not contribute to the @xmath30 dependence because we chose the @xmath186 axis ( lab ) in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "we see in fig.7 that the onset of ct in the @xmath30 dependence requires larger projectile energies .",
    "this is because the ct impacts the fsi only at energies @xmath195 . at energies ( @xmath196 ) , before the onset of ct , the @xmath197 dependence can be used to check predictions of the elastic eikonal approximation .    to discuss the energy dependence of @xmath133 we include in our consideration also the models which accounts for both the plc and large ( blob ) size configurations in hard scattering @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "we follow to the prescription of ref.@xcite and represent the hard @xmath1 scattering amplitude as : @xmath198 @xmath199 is the component of hard scattering amplitude which produces the plc and leads to ct .",
    "@xmath200 corresponds to the large size ( soft ) component of @xmath1 scattering amplitude and has a cross section comparable to @xmath201 .",
    "the source of such a soft component could be either the opening of @xmath202 channels at energies near threshold@xcite or the presence of landshoff processes in hard @xmath1 scattering@xcite .",
    "implications of both mechanisms for ct were discussed in details in ref.@xcite , where plc expansion effects are accounted for within the multi resonance expansion model of ct . in the present calculation we describe the expansion effects within qdm using the same ralston - pire parameterization for @xmath203 .",
    "the numerical results of the multi resonance model and qdm for ct in @xmath204 , and @xmath205 reactions are very close @xcite . in fig.8",
    "we present the energy dependence of @xmath133 at two values of @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "it shows that the higher the spectator transverse momentum , the larger is the ct effect .",
    "the increase of the incoming energy of the proton diminishes the sensitivity of @xmath133 to @xmath193 , due to reduced sensitivity to the expansion . the model which accounts for the interference between large and small size components of hard @xmath1 scattering , as expected , reveal oscillation with the increase of projectile energy .",
    "new feature is that amplitude of these oscillations increase with @xmath149 and the phases of oscillations are opposite for kinematics dominated by screening ( @xmath208 ) and by rescattering ( @xmath209 ) effects of isi / fsi .",
    "as we have seen in sec.3.1 , @xmath210 at @xmath211 , and @xmath212 at @xmath213 , ( see , figs.3,6,8 ) . since , by definition , @xmath214 means complete transparency ( i.e. no isi / fsi ) ct produces opposite trends in the regions where @xmath210 and @xmath212 ( see e.g. fig.6b ) .",
    "this property calls for a more sensitive quantity to characterize ct @xcite .",
    "we define the ratio : @xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath217 are such that @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "this ratio is more sensitive to ct due to different trends of ct effects in the numerator and denominator of @xmath220 while it will be less sensitive to uncertainties in the theoretical calculations . in fig.9",
    "we present the energy dependence of @xmath220 , which shows deviations of qdm prediction from the eikonal approximation , in the range of the initial proton momenta @xmath221 , by a factor @xmath222 due to ct .",
    "because of opposite phases of energy oscillations within the models which accounts for the interference between blc and plc ( fig.8 ) , @xmath220 reveals profound oscillations in fig.9 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath220 on the azimuthal angle of the spectator - fig.10 at fixed energies of initial proton could be used as a complementary method in the study of ct . due to large fsi in the out - of - plane kinematics , the qdm prediction of ct at @xmath223",
    "could be enhanced by the factor of @xmath224 over the eikonal results .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that ia is strongly suppressed for inelastic recoil final states in the deuteron fragmentation region .",
    "this was due to the fact that under those circumstances the ia is controlled by the inelastic component of the deuteron ground state , which is negligible for recoil momenta @xmath225 .",
    "thus the cross section is dominated by the rescattering diagrams . therefore the ct will manifest itself by a reduced production of low momentum inelastic states in the deuteron fragmentation region at increasing projectile energies . in fig.11 we present the calculation of the ratio of the cross section of quasielastic @xmath0 reaction to that of @xmath226 reaction .",
    "the calculations are done in the qdm and the elastic eikonal approximation @xcite .",
    "fig.11 reveals a strong sensitivity of the ratio to ct . for incident momenta from @xmath227",
    "the eikonal approximation shows a drop in the ratio of @xmath228 , while the inclusion of ct leads to a decrease by a factor of @xmath229 .",
    "this suggests a very simple method for studying ct effects i.e. the measurement of the energy dependence of quasielastic and inelastic rates in the deuteron fragmentation region .",
    "we calculated the cross section of hard exclusive @xmath0 reaction taking into account the initial and final state interactions , within the elastic eikonal approximation .",
    "analysis of feynman diagrams in the relativistic domain produced significant effects beyond the conventional nonrelativistic glauber type formulae .",
    "the results can be applied to any nucleus .",
    "the deuteron calculations were done analytically using a well known form of the deuteron wave function .",
    "the calculation produced a diffractive pattern in the cross section due to isi / fsi . in the kinematics where @xmath172 , @xmath230 the isi / fsi suppress the cross section with respect to ia , while at @xmath172 @xmath231 the isi / fsi increases the cross section .",
    "another result is the prediction of an azimuthal angle dependence due to fsi .",
    "this is a result of including small but finite angles of the scattered protons into the soft rescattering amplitude .",
    "we estimated the validity of the factorization approximation within the elastic eikonal approach .",
    "we found that the factorization approximation is valid for @xmath172 to better than @xmath178 for @xmath232 .",
    "since isi / fsi dominate the cross section in @xmath0 , the ct phenomenon will be best observed in this reaction .",
    "we calculated the transparency @xmath133 with the quantum diffusion model and model where the interference between small and large size components of large angle @xmath1 scattering are taken into account explicitly . exploiting the fact that ct leads to opposite effects in the kinematical regions where @xmath210 and @xmath212 , we introduced the ratio @xmath233 , which reveals extra sensitivity to ct effect . at presently accessible energies ,",
    "the predictions of energy and angular dependences of @xmath220 differ by as much as a factor of 2 - 6 between the eikonal and ct calculations .",
    "the model with the interference of large and small size configurations predicts profound oscillations for the energy dependence of @xmath220 .",
    "an additional possibility to search for ct was found .",
    "it consists of measuring the energy dependence of the ratio of the production rates of elastic and inelastic recoil states in the deuteron fragmentation region .",
    "while conventional calculation predict practically no energy dependence , the ct predicts a significant drop of this ratio with increasing the projectile energies .",
