    "the most interesting feature of the first order phase transition is the global kinetics of transformation of a mother phase into a state of objects of a new phase .",
    "traditionally the theoretical description of the first order phase transition kinetics is given on example of nucleation @xcite .",
    "then the mother phase is a supersaturated vapor and the new phase is a liquid phase .",
    "the driving force of the first order phase transition is initiated by metastability which is traditionally described by the value of a supersaturation @xmath0 .",
    "the last is the ratio of the density of surplus vapor and the density of the saturated vapor minus one unit .",
    "kinetics of nucleation has been already investigated in the case of the ordinary ( unlimited ) phase transition . in that case",
    "the property of the blow - up growth has been actively used @xcite .",
    "this property means that the rate of growth of the molecules number inside the droplet for a given droplet rapidly increases in time .",
    "it grows so rapidly , that even acceleration of the rate of growth also grows in time .",
    "this property leads to two important consequences , which allow to give an analytical description of the nucleation period .",
    "these consequences are the following :    * the nucleation period ( i.e. the period of rather intensive appearance of supercritical droplets ) is well localized in time . * the droplets appeared in the first moments of nucleation period contain the main quantity of molecules ( in comparison with other droplets ) during the nucleation period .",
    "these first moments can be called as the pre - nucleation period . during the pre - nucleation period",
    "the droplets do nt essentially perturb the state of the system .",
    "this allows to calculate the characteristics of droplets appeared during the pre - nucleation period .",
    "for example , the regime of the unlimited free molecular growth has the mentioned feature .",
    "namely here the number of molecules @xmath1 inside the supercritical embryo ( i.e. inside the droplet ) grows in time @xmath2 as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a characteristic constant which has a sense of a mean time between collisions of a given molecule in saturated vapor with other molecules .",
    "this type of growth is wide spread in nature .",
    "later we shall use this type of growth as a model for concrete formulas .    in previous theories for nucleation kinetics ( see rewiev in @xcite )",
    "it was supposed that the sizes of droplets can become in principle infinitely big . here",
    "we consider the opposite situation . in many systems",
    "the process of the droplets growth is limited by some artificial restrictions .",
    "the number @xmath1 of molecules inside the droplet can not be greater than some value @xmath5 , which is an external parameter of the theory .",
    "we imply that @xmath5 strongly exceeds the number @xmath6 in the critical embryo under the supersaturation which corresponds to relatively intensive appearance of droplets ( this condition will be specified ) .",
    "the existence of a limit size takes place in the processes of cementation , of condensation in an external lattice , morphological transitions , etc .",
    "this type of transition is rather wide spread in nature .",
    "kinetics of this process will be investigated in this paper .",
    "the limit of droplets sizes leads to the loss of the blow up property of growth in the global kinetics of nucleation . from the first point of view",
    "it seems that the introduction of a limit size can not essentially change the approaches of description , but it is an illusion and below some principally new methods of solution of kinetic equations have to be presented .",
    "this publication continues the set of articles devoted to the construction of the global kinetics of a phase transition ( see @xcite ) . to grasp the current approach it would be useful to come through these papers .",
    "we use all physical assumptions from these papers except explicitly mentioned ones .",
    "all definitions of physical characteristics can be taken also from @xcite .",
    "traditionally two characteristic types of external conditions are considered .",
    "the first type is a decay of a metastable state @xcite .",
    "here at the initial moment of time we have the metastable phase with no objects of a new phase in the system .",
    "later there will be no external influence on the system .",
    "the process of nucleation begins and the appearance and growth of droplets cause the fall of supersaturation which stops the further intensive nucleation .",
    "the second type is nucleation under the smooth variation of external conditions . at first moments of time",
    "the increase of supersaturation by the action of external conditions is greater than the decrease due to the mother phase consumption by the droplets .",
    "but the vapor consumption has a very rapidly increasing intensity and later the mentioned decrease will overtake the mentioned increase and the supersaturation will go down .",
    "the process of intensive nucleation will stop .",
    "we are going to describe kinetics of the process in both situations .",
    "we shall use the following law of droplets growth for @xmath7 : @xmath8 @xmath9    rigorously speaking it would necessary to determine the variable which has the velocity of growth independent on the value of this variable .",
    "we shall act in another manner : at first we suppose that there is no limitation on growth and then calculate the number of molecules in a droplet by a `` curved '' formula .    here",
    "it is possible to introduce the following variables : the variable @xmath10 is the number of molecules in the droplet which is growing without any limit by an initial law ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the variable @xmath11 is the value of @xmath10 for droplet which was born at `` initial '' moment of time . certainly , for every droplet @xmath12 .",
    "the variable @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 .",
    "then we see the correspondence between @xmath2 and @xmath11 and the correspondence between @xmath2 and @xmath13 .",
    "the values @xmath11 and @xmath13 are now equivalent .",
    "the number of molecules @xmath1 inside the droplet has to be calculated now as @xmath15 and @xmath16 we see that here there is no unique analytic dependence and this will seriously complicate the evolution equation .",
    "we have also to mention that the property of the effective size of growth which was observed in recent publication @xcite in construction of kinetics for the law ( [ 1 ] ) with small @xmath17 also does nt take place . for droplets with",
    "is imaginary value calculated purely according to ( [ 1 ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath18 such a property is observed , but for droplets with @xmath19 is the opposite property of the blow - up regime takes place .",
    "namely the situation where both regions are important in substance balance is interesting .",
    "all analytical constructions are based on the following approximation for the rate of nucleation @xmath20 as a function of supersaturation : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the base of decomposition and the positive parameter @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the free energy of a critical embryo .",
    "the last approximation is not more than the klapeiron - klausius approximation , but it is written for special variables . the validity of this approximation has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "now we shall consider the situation of decay .",
    "the initial value of supersaturation will be marked by @xmath26 .",
    "the base of decomposition @xmath22 for function @xmath0 can be chosen as @xmath26 .",
    "we skip the derivation of kinetic equation because it is quite similar to the ordinary case without the limit size and can be seen in @xcite or in @xcite .",
    "the kinetic equation for the evolution can be written in the following form : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the amplitude value of spectrum , @xmath29 is the heavisaid s function , @xmath30 .",
    "solution of this equation will give the behavior @xmath0 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "it allows to calculate the number of droplets ( in renormalized units ) @xmath31 appeared until the moment @xmath32 ( i.e. until the moment when the imaginary front side of the spectrum attains the value @xmath11 ) .",
    "the most interesting value is the total number of droplets @xmath33 and the error in this value will be the measure of the accuracy of approximate description .",
    "in contrast to the decay with the unlimited growth we shall have here the several stages of the process of decay and the long continuous tail .",
    "the meaning of these parts of the process will be clear later and now we shall start with investigation of the first period and have to put initial conditions .",
    "namely , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and there is no droplets in the system .",
    "now we shall introduce the value of natural length @xmath36 as the characteristic width of spectrum without the limit of growth .",
    "for this situation we have the following kinetic equation @xmath37 which results in the following characteristic width of the size spectrum @xmath38 namely @xmath39    one can see that @xmath40 is a function of @xmath26 since @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "it is possible to see three situations :    \\(a ) @xmath43 ,    \\(b ) @xmath44 ,    \\(c ) @xmath45 .      in this case kinetic equation ( [ kin ] ) can be reduced to @xmath46 for the function @xmath47 which has the sense of the number of molecules inside the new phase .",
    "this equation is known from unlimited case and can be solved by iterations : @xmath48 @xmath49 calculation gives @xmath50 and already the second iteration gives the practically accurate number of droplets @xmath51 the relative error @xmath52 is less than @xmath53 in every case which can be analytically proven .",
    "the high accuracy is also attained also for @xmath54 calculated on the base of the first iteration i.e for @xmath55 these values will be important later .    but this does nt complete the investigation as in the case of unlimited growth . earlier or later the droplets sizes attain @xmath5 and the droplets stop to grow .",
    "then the final value of the supersaturation will be @xmath56 here index @xmath57 points that we investigate the first part of the nucleation period .",
    "the time of attaining @xmath58 can be easily calculated on the base of monodisperse approximation .",
    "the last approximation leads to equation @xmath59 which can be easily integrated ( as the first order differential equation without explicit dependence on the argument ) : @xmath60 the integral can be taken analytically and gives @xmath61 .",
    "condition @xmath62 gives the value of the end @xmath63 of the first part of nucleation .",
    "one can compare @xmath63 with the duration of intensive nucleation during the first part , i.e. with @xmath64    when the inequality @xmath65 is nt too strong then the equation ( [ mono ] ) is nt suitable because the monodisperse approximation lying in the base of ( [ mono ] ) is nt valid even at @xmath66 .",
    "then one has to use instead of ( [ mono ] ) the following equation @xmath67    the methods of solution of this equation are quite similar to the methods of solution of ( [ mono ] ) ( they are presented in @xcite ) .    while approaching to @xmath68 one has to take into account that @xmath69 begin to change because integration can not be done out of @xmath70 .",
    "these changes can be taken into account by the perturbation technique ( because the main influence is given by @xmath71 which remains unperturbed ) .",
    "several important statements can be proved here .",
    "they are :    * \\(a ) the process of nucleation takes place in the quasistationary conditions .",
    "the time @xmath72 of essential perturbation of the droplets distribution , which can be estimated as @xmath73 strongly exceeds the time @xmath74 of establishing the stationary state in the near critical region ( more accurate in the region see @xcite , @xcite . ] @xmath75 ) . *",
    "\\(b ) the main role in the vapor consumption is played by the strongly supercritical droplets , i.e. by the droplets with @xmath76 .",
    "these droplets grow regularly with the mentioned law of growth . *",
    "\\(c ) the process of intensive nucleation takes place at @xmath77 . *",
    "\\(d ) later the new periods of nucleation ( may be not so intensive but long ) will take place .",
    "the statements ( a ) , ( b ) are necessary for construction of the kinetic equation .",
    "the statement ( c ) allows to use the approximation ( [ + + + ] ) .",
    "the statement ( d ) requires to continue the consideration of the nucleation process which will be done below .",
    "the last step to do is to give approximation for the number of droplets .",
    "after the evident rescaling the kinetic equation can be presented as @xmath78 the number of droplets appeared until @xmath11 can be calculated as @xmath79 we shall use the following approximation @xmath80 the relative error @xmath81 as function of @xmath13 is drawn in figure 1 .",
    "we see that it is small .",
    "this case is much more simple than the previous one . here",
    "the kinetic equation can be written as @xmath82 or @xmath83 for @xmath84 it can be solved very easy .",
    "namely , after the differentiation we come to @xmath85 which can be easily integrated @xmath86 the spectrum has the form @xmath87    one can see that here the number of total droplets @xmath88 is infinite .",
    "it is certainly a wrong result .",
    "the reason is inapplicability of approximation ( [ + + + ] ) .",
    "the head of the spectrum is described quite satisfactory , but the tail is nt described well . really at @xmath89",
    "the nucleation according this approximation does nt stop . to describe the tail we have to use the precise equation for the stationary nucleation rate @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the zeldovitch factor @xcite",
    ", @xmath25 is the free energy of the critical embryo , taken in some approach but without approximate decomposition ( [ + + + ] ) .",
    "for example , in capillary approximation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is renormalized surface tension . then @xmath94 or @xmath95",
    "the last equation can be easily integrated @xmath96 or @xmath97    one can get an analytical solution for the tail of spectrum having noticed that at small @xmath0 one can decompose @xmath98 .",
    "the values of @xmath0 can not be too small , at least @xmath99 and the behavior of @xmath91 is nt singular .",
    "so we can reduce the last equation to @xmath100 with known constants @xmath101 .",
    "the integral can be reduced to the error function .",
    "this solves the problem of explicit solution in terms of standard special functions .",
    "here one has no need to observe the property ( b ) because this property begin to be violated only when @xmath102 strongly exceeds @xmath103 and then practically all droplets attain the final values . as for the quasistationarity ( property ( a ) )",
    "we see that @xmath104 decreases in time and if ( a ) is observed in the initial moment of time it will be observed also later .",
    "the absence of the property ( c ) was taken into account just above . instead of",
    "( d ) one can state that this stage will be the last stage of the whole nucleation process in the system .",
    "the intermediate case is the most complex one and has to be investigated on the base of the already presented solutions .",
    "let the kinetic equation be rescaled to have @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 certainly , here @xmath108 will be also rescaled .",
    "now we shall give the approximate method to solve this equation .",
    "the value @xmath109 can be presented as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the rescaled number of molecules in the droplets which have already attained @xmath108 , @xmath112 is the rescaled number of molecules in all other droplets .    for further constructions we have to write approximations for @xmath112 and @xmath111 .",
    "we shall start with @xmath112    the function @xmath112 can be easily found on the base of iteration procedure presented for the case @xmath113 .",
    "then @xmath114 here @xmath28 is the amplitude which can differ from @xmath57 due to the possible big value of @xmath111 . at the current moment",
    "this remark is nt too clear , but in any case we can say that for further purposes it is convenient to conserve @xmath28 here .",
    "now we shall explain the last relation .",
    "at @xmath115 we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 it is important that the last equation is the closed one and it is identical to the case of unlimited growth .",
    "so , it can be successfully solved by iterations .",
    "particularly , @xmath118 , etc .",
    "at @xmath119 we have @xmath120    now we give the qualitative picture of phenomena . at the first moments of time",
    "the spectrum in the region @xmath121 is being formed and @xmath122 but @xmath112 is growing rather rapidly @xmath123 .",
    "later the substance is going to be accumulated in droplets with @xmath124 .",
    "the growth of @xmath111 occurs .",
    "if the size of cut - off @xmath108 is essentially smaller than @xmath125 then @xmath112 accumulates not so many molecules of substance @xmath126 and later due to the decrease of nucleation rate the value of @xmath112 will also decrease , i.e. @xmath127 in this case @xmath111 grows as @xmath128 it will grow slower than @xmath129 this allows to state that @xmath130 then the variation @xmath131 in @xmath111 during `` the time '' of establishing of the quasistationary state in the region @xmath132 $ ] can be estimated as @xmath133 in the expression for @xmath112 for @xmath134 the last inequality allows to take @xmath135 away from the integral .",
    "then approximately @xmath136 and on the base of initial iteration approximation @xmath137    now we shall get expression for @xmath111 .",
    "we shall get for @xmath111 the following approximate equation @xmath138 here @xmath11 is the current `` moment of time '' , @xmath108 is the `` moment '' when the spectrum attains @xmath108 .",
    "here we are interested in the other characteristic scales of time which are greater than @xmath139 . at these times",
    "we can suppose that @xmath140 is approximately constant and take it out of the integral .",
    "then approximately @xmath141 when @xmath112 is essential ( i.e. @xmath140 is small ) then @xmath111 is nt necessary and we can take out @xmath140 .",
    "but when @xmath112 is small , then @xmath142 and we can also take it out .",
    "the substance consumption in @xmath112 occurs in the avalanche manner .",
    "we can get solution of this equation quite analogously to the case @xmath143 but here the initial conditions will be another @xmath144 solution will be @xmath145 and @xmath146 the spectrum will be @xmath147 or @xmath148    in the initial approximation we consider @xmath149 and get @xmath150 then we take @xmath151 and get @xmath152    it is necessary refine expression for the spectrum obtained in the zero approximation .",
    "we have to take into account that @xmath111 is formed under the influence of @xmath112 .",
    "but the spectrum in the last expression is written through @xmath112 ( but not through @xmath111 ) . here is the difficulty .",
    "we shall come it over via the special approximate approach .",
    "at first we assume that @xmath112 ( but not the @xmath111 ) is formed with the renormalized intensity .",
    "we take @xmath153 instead of @xmath154 .",
    "it is evident that we do this only in the first factor which is responsible for the influence of @xmath112 .",
    "so , we get @xmath155 for @xmath156 we have to take the renormalized amplitude .",
    "the natural candidate for this amplitude is @xmath157 . as the result",
    "we come to the following expression for spectrum @xmath158 where @xmath159 @xmath160    now let us realize what have we done . in reality",
    "we had to take into account the inverse influence , i.e. to take into account that @xmath111 is formed under the influence of @xmath112 , but not the influence of @xmath111 on @xmath112 .",
    "to take into account the inverse influence we shall use the inverse transformation @xmath161 .",
    "so , approximately @xmath162 we can calculate this transformation rather easy @xmath163    this will solve the problem of the adequate construction of the approximate spectrum .",
    "the error of this approximation in the total droplets number is drawn in figure 2 .",
    "certainly , we can not calculate here the total number of droplets ( it will be infinite and has to be corrected by the way described in the previous subsection ) . as the final value @xmath68 the magnitude",
    "@xmath164 has been chosen .",
    "the last belongs to the asymptotic period .",
    "one can see that the relative error in the droplets number is small .",
    "statements ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) take place here . statement",
    "( d ) is nt necessary .      the case @xmath165 requires the analysis of the further nucleation .",
    "this analysis is nt too complex . on the base of",
    "@xmath166 we can calculate the length @xmath167 as @xmath168 i.e. we use the same formula but with @xmath169 instead of @xmath26 . in expression ( [ delta ] ) there is an amplitude of spectrum @xmath28 which is a very sharp function of supersaturation .",
    "so , we see that @xmath170 this strong inequality allows to neglect the time interval @xmath171 $ ] in the nucleation at @xmath172 . then the situation is reduced to the nucleation with initial supersaturation @xmath172 .",
    "we have to repeat the steps of the three previous sections .",
    "again we can come to the possibilities ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the possibility ( a ) can not take place because the inequality @xmath173 does nt take place . here",
    "the l.h.s . is @xmath174 in rescaled units , @xmath175 has to be put to @xmath176 , the coefficient @xmath177 in denominator came from the power @xmath178 in ( [ delta ] ) , the parameter @xmath179 has to satisfy @xmath180 .",
    "so , we see that the structure of spectrum is nt too complex - the plateau , the region of partial collapse of surplus substance and may be the tail .",
    "the analysis of nucleation after instantaneous creation of a metastable state has been completed .",
    "the straightforward generalization of kinetic equation to the case of smooth change of external conditions leads to the following kinetic equation @xmath181 @xmath182 here @xmath183 is ideal supersaturation , i.e. the supersaturation which should take place in the system without any processes of vapor consumption and heat release effects .",
    "the value of @xmath26 at some characteristic moment @xmath184 will be marked as @xmath185 .",
    "we shall choose @xmath184 later .",
    "the number of droplets ( in renormalized units ) will be calculated as @xmath186    under the unlimited growth of droplets the period of nucleation is well localized in time .",
    "moreover it is rather short in time which allows to linearize the ideal supersaturation during this period . here",
    "the process of nucleation can not be localized in time , it is seen simply by the fact that the number of droplets in a liquid phase is limited from above by @xmath187 . then to compensate the `` action '' of external conditions it is necessary to have nucleation again and again .",
    "to present concrete calculations we suppose that the ideal supersaturation can be linearized @xmath188 but now is is no more than a model .",
    "later we shall see how to construct the theory for rather arbitrary behavior @xmath183 .",
    "restriction @xmath193 , @xmath194 does nt lead to the special meaning of the point @xmath195 ( in homogeneous condensation @xmath195 was the point of the maximum of supersaturation , in heterogeneous condensation @xmath195 was the point where the half of droplets have been appeared ) .",
    "one has simply require that @xmath196 is nt too far from the maximum of supersaturation .",
    "this fact can be also analytically proved here .        when @xmath199 the process of nucleation can be described rather simple .",
    "to describe the first peak of the nucleation intensity we have to solve equation without limit of growth .",
    "this case is well known and can be solved both by iterations @xcite and by universal solution @xcite .",
    "thus , we get @xmath175 - the number of droplets formed in the first peak . one can see @xmath200",
    ". then the supersaturation @xmath0 continues to fall until @xmath201 .",
    "the inequality @xmath199 allows here to speak about the well formed peak of nucleation intensity and to use the standard procedure of unlimited growth . at @xmath202",
    "the supesaturation begins to grow . at @xmath203",
    "we have @xmath204 . at @xmath205",
    "the second peak of nucleation begins .",
    "after differentiation with account of linearization we have @xmath209 in our units @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath194 .",
    "integration with initial conditions @xmath212 gives @xmath213 this value will be marked as @xmath214 .",
    "then the spectrum @xmath215 will be @xmath216 at @xmath217 we see @xmath218 .",
    "* the limit solutions have to be radically modified .",
    "the force of the already presented methods for these solutions is nt sufficient to give the total description . *",
    "description of the base of the iteration method can not be suitable because the process is nt restricted in time .",
    "due to the previous analysis we shall approximate the spectrum by several peaks .",
    "every peak is formed by some external effective source ( initiated both by external conditions and by the action of the tail of the previous peak ) .",
    "the distance between peaks of nucleation is approximately @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the number of droplets formed in the previous peak .",
    "certainly , between different peaks the distance can be different because @xmath223 will be different , but the suitable approximation is to consider @xmath223 to be the ideal value , i.e. at the first peak",
    ". the last formula will be rather evident if we notice that the action of external conditions has simply to compensate the loss of substance which is equal to @xmath224 .",
    "now we have to rescale the amplitude of the next peak .",
    "we neglect the non - linear behavior of effective source .",
    "then the next peak will be similar after rescaling to the previous one .",
    "but without rescaling in the same units the next peak will have a new ( ordinary smaller ) height and another width ( ordinary wider ) .",
    "so , now we have to determine the new intensity @xmath226 of the effective source ( the initial intensity was @xmath227 ) .",
    "we know the expression for intensity of vapor consumption by droplets i.e. @xmath228 : @xmath229 the subintegral function has the form @xmath230 and approximately has maximum at @xmath231 for @xmath232 and @xmath233 for @xmath234 ( here we can put @xmath195 at maximum because this choice will result only in parameters but not in the spectrum form ) .",
    "the current peak have coordinate @xmath225 , the next peak will have coordinate @xmath235 .",
    "the maximum of subintegral expression for @xmath236 for the next peak will be attained at @xmath237.the main effect is connected with a property that at @xmath238 the essential quantity of droplets from the previous peak has attained the value @xmath179 .",
    "but not all droplets have attained this value .",
    "so , the supersaturation @xmath0 lies higher than the supposed value @xmath239 which would ensure the similarity of the next peak to the previous one .",
    "we suppose that at @xmath241 approximately corresponding to the coordinate of the next peak all droplets of the previous peak will attain the limit value @xmath224 and there will be no difference between the value of effective ideal supersaturation ( the supersaturation imaginary formed without droplets of the last peak taken into account ) @xmath242 at @xmath225 and at @xmath243 @xmath244 the effective intensity @xmath226 of the external source can be approximated as @xmath245 and have to be compared with @xmath246        we can express @xmath253 as @xmath254 where @xmath255 is the spectrum corresponding to the external ideal supersaturation . since @xmath256 one can see that the effect of the influence of the current peak is negligible and @xmath257 @xmath258",
    "so , finally we have the following formula for @xmath226 : @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the difference of supersaturations at @xmath261 and at @xmath262 calculated for the previous peak . here",
    "@xmath225 is the coordinate of the maximum of the supersaturation .",
    "the difference @xmath263 can be calculated as @xmath264        even such simple rescaling brings a rather accurate result . when @xmath265 the accuracy will be better .",
    "it can be proved analytically .",
    "the simple account of variations of @xmath266 will give the better accuracy also .",
    "all other errors can be taken into account by the standard perturbation technique .",
    "we see that already at @xmath267 the first peak lies not so far from the stationary solution ( [ stat ] )",
    ". later all peaks will be even smaller than the first one .",
    "so , we can consider @xmath268 as the small parameter and linearize the kinetic equation over this parameter .",
    "then this solution can be solved analytically and will give the oscillations relaxing to @xmath219 .",
    "we can avoid these long analytical derivations and simply draw the relaxation oscillations @xmath269 with two parameters @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "the arguments for derivation of @xmath266 takes place here also .",
    "parameters @xmath270 and @xmath271 can be determined by a coincidence of approximate and real solution at maxima of two first peaks .",
    "we choose maxima for coincidence of real solution and approximate solution because namely here the intensity of nucleation has maxima .",
    "the first local minima demonstrates the deviation of approximate solution from the real one but here the intensity of nucleation is small .",
    "now we know the methods to describe nucleation adequately , but parameters in these approximations are unknown and our next task will be to determine these parameters . to do this we have to know the evolution during several first peaks of nucleation . in the advanced pulse method we have to know the evolution during the first peak including the back side of the peak and in the advanced relaxation method we have to know the positions and values of two first maximums .",
    "these characteristics will be determined on the base of iteration methods .",
    "but here the iteration methods can not be got by direct generalization of already presented procedures in the case of condensation under the pure free molecular regime of vapor consumption @xcite , @xcite .",
    "really , even in the pure free molecular regime it is difficult to describe even the back side of spectrum on the base of standard iterations and here we need to describe the second peak .",
    "the limitation of growth will also diminish the converging power of iterations .",
    "so we need to reexamine the iteration procedure .",
    "as suitable initial approximations one can propose @xmath277 or @xmath278 @xmath279 since here it will be impossible to take only two first iterations there is no special significance what approximation we shall use .",
    "we prefer to use the first one because here the chain of inequalities @xmath280 for every fixed @xmath13 is observed .",
    "these iterations are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the analytical calculation of iterations will stop at the second step .",
    "for the unlimited free molecular regime this number of iteration is sufficient , but here we have to calculate the next iterations .",
    "it is possible analytically if we choose the decomposition of exponent in the subintegral function . but here the following difficulty appear .",
    "the value of @xmath281 goes to infinity and it is nt possible to decompose @xmath282 over @xmath283 . the other possibility is to decompose @xmath284 over @xmath285 near some characteristic value of the exponent argument .",
    "but at @xmath286 the value of @xmath281 goes to zero and the spectrum looks like @xmath287 .",
    "then it is impossible to use the second decomposition at initial moments of time ( i.e. at negative @xmath13 ) .",
    "but this very period drives the evolution during the first peak of nucleation and , thus , plays the main role in nucleation description .",
    "so , the pure second approach can not lead to a suitable result .",
    "so , we need to give here more sophisticated approach .    we shall act in the following manner .",
    "already the first iteration gives us the approximate position of the first maximum @xmath288 and the value of this maximum @xmath289 .",
    "then we propose the following procedure    * when @xmath290 then @xmath291 here the first four terms are taken into account .",
    "it is sufficient to ensure the high relative accuracy .",
    "* when @xmath292 then @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the base of decompositions .",
    "+ here decomposition of the corresponding exponent is limited also by the first four terms .",
    "then the iterations can be calculated analytically at every step and they give the adequate approximation for the solution .",
    "they converge to the solution of kinetic equation where instead of @xmath295 one should write the presented approximation . already the four first terms of decomposition of the corresponding exponent ensure the high accuracy .",
    "we see that already the several first iterations give the practically precise positions of the first maximum and the first minimum @xmath296 at @xmath297 .",
    "later we see that iterations converge but every new iteration gives the `` step '' of coincidence with the real solution which becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the reason of this failure is the following : really , the precise solution does nt go far from @xmath298 and decomposition works , but every iteration inevitably goes to zero or to infinity and on every iteration the decomposition doest work .",
    "this error leads to crisis in convergence of iterations .",
    "so , we need to modify iterations .      now we know @xmath289 and @xmath296 and can use these characteristics .",
    "one can analytically prove that for every @xmath299 @xmath300 then we can require that before we use decomposition the following cut - off    * when @xmath301 we should take instead of @xmath302 the value the constant @xmath289 and fulfill no further decompositions .",
    "* when @xmath303 we should take instead of @xmath302 the value the constant @xmath296 and fulfill no further decompositions .",
    "* when @xmath304 no special actions are required and we have to make the mentioned decompositions .    the convergence of new iterations is higher than the convergence of previous iterations .",
    "new iterations evidently converge to the real solution .",
    "also it is very easy to estimate rigorously the error of decomposition because now we have an estimate @xmath305 for every @xmath13 and for every @xmath306 .      *",
    "the cut - off iterations without decompositions converge to the real solution of kinetic equation and they converge faster than the first - type iterations",
    ". the chains of inequalities ( [ chain ] ) remain valid for the cut - off iterations without decompositions . *",
    "the iterations with decompositions converge to the solution of kinetic equation where function @xmath295 is treated according to the mentioned decompositions .",
    "the chains of inequalities ( [ chain ] ) remain valid ( here @xmath281 is solution of kinetic equation where the function @xmath295 is treated according to the mentioned decompositions ) conserves the monotonious properties .",
    "it can be shown if we differentiate the approximation and note that the derivative of approximation is the approximation for the derivative of exponent . then with the necessary terms taken into account and with account that @xmath307 this derivative can be made positive .",
    "then the monotonious properties remain even after decompositions . ] .    for practical needs one can show that for @xmath308 already the sixth iteration ensures the correct values of @xmath309 and @xmath310 ( the value and the coordinate of the second peak ) then the iterations will approximate these values even better then at @xmath267 .",
    "it can be proved analytically . ] .",
    "this is all we need to construct the relaxation oscillations .",
    "when @xmath265 we can use the advanced pulse method and here we need to describe only the first peak .",
    "it can be done by the first four iterations ( really , if it would be necessary to get the coordinate of the second peak we might have difficulties because of the very small value of @xmath311 ."
