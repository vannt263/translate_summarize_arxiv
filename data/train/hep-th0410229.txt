    "while de sitter space shares the same number of isometries as minkowski space , field theories exhibit some surprising properties in this simplest of curved backgrounds .",
    "an immediate example is the enormous stretching of scales in de sitter space which naturally connects short distances in the past to large distances today .",
    "this rapid expansion is a familiar and very appealing feature of inflation @xcite . during the slow - roll regime of inflation , for which de sitter space",
    "is an idealization , quantum fluctuations grow exponentially large and eventually seed the large scale structure of the universe . depending upon the hubble scale and the duration of inflation ,",
    "this large scale structure could have been determined by fluctuations which occurred at or well below the planck scale .",
    "most models of inflation produce far more than the necessary sixty @xmath2-folds necessary to solve the horizon problem and this connection between large scales and potentially planckian physics has been called the `` transplanckian problem '' of inflation @xcite , although it has recently been viewed as more of an opportunity , since it could allow the observation of physics well beyond experimentally accessible scales , most typically within an order of magnitude or two above the hubble scale during inflation .",
    "non - thermal features of the state for the field driving inflation tend to provide a more robust signal of these transplanckian effects @xcite .",
    "a further difference from minkowski space is the existence of a much richer family of invariant or covariant states in de sitter space . for a free scalar field in a de sitter background ,",
    "the states invariant under the @xmath3 isometry group can be distinguished by a complex parameter @xmath1 , although only real values of @xmath1 correspond to @xmath4 invariant theories @xcite .",
    "these @xmath1-vacua are not the lowest energy eigenstates of a globally conserved hamiltonian , as is the case of the standard poincar ' e - invariant vacuum of minkowski space , since de sitter space does not admit a globally defined time - like killing vector .",
    "nevertheless , a unique element in this infinite family , the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite , can be selected by demanding that at short distances or as the curvature of the de sitter space is taken to zero the state should match with the vacuum of minkowski space .    both of these features emphasize the need for understanding quantum field theory  particularly the ideas of decoupling and renormalization  in an expanding background starting from a non - standard state .",
    "for this purpose the @xmath1-vacua provide an ideal test case to study how these ideas are to be modified in such a setting since the high amount of symmetry of these non - thermal states allows them to be readily analyzed analytically .",
    "it was recently realized that for a scalar field in an @xmath1-state , a point source propagator does not produce a well behaved perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "one method for expressing this pathological behavior is to impose a cutoff @xmath5 on physical three - momentum of the theory .",
    "loop processes then diverge as @xmath6 in such a way as can not be cancelled by simple counterterms .",
    "for example , the one - loop correction to the self - energy in a @xmath7 theory diverges linearly with @xmath5 and the dependence of this divergent term on the external momentum does not match that of a @xmath8 counterterm @xcite .",
    "the resolution of these divergences came with the realization that the propagator should be modified for these states to be the green s function for _ two _ point sources @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we examine the structure and the properties of a spin @xmath0 fermion in a de sitter background , which possesses its own one - parameter set of covariant states @xcite .",
    "one reason for doing so is to learn whether the double source construction for the scalar field can be circumvented by using fermionic loops to cancel the non - renormalizable divergences from bosonic loops . while a fermion loop correction to a scalar self - energy also diverges linearly with the cutoff @xmath5 , here we show that this divergence can not be cancelled by that of the bosonic loop , even allowing an arbitrary fine - tuning of the relative values of @xmath1 for the scalar and the fermion fields .    as with a bosonic @xmath1-vacuum ,",
    "the peculiar divergences in fermion loops arise from an inconsistency between the single - source propagator and the fermionic @xmath1-state . in some sense",
    ", the physical setting resembles a field theory where we have imposed boundary conditions along an initial time surface @xcite .",
    "there , we must also modify the propagator by adding an image source to obtain a consistent perturbation theory ; any new divergences that result from this modification only appear as counterterms restricted to the initial surface .",
    "the bulk theory is unchanged . in de sitter space ,",
    "the inconsistency is also resolved by adding a new source term in the definition of the propagator when in an @xmath1-state .",
    "the remarkable property of de sitter space is that there exists a special point , the antipode , at which a source can be placed without breaking the @xmath3 symmetry properties of the state . for a fermion",
    ", the extra antipodal source entails some additional dirac structure .",
    "the next section derives the @xmath1-states for a spin @xmath0 dirac field in a de sitter background .",
    "the @xmath1-propagator for a point source is developed in sec .",
    "[ pointpropagation ] .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ fermiloop ] that a theory with a yukawa coupling produces divergences in the one - loop corrections to the scalar propagator which can not be cancelled by adding simple counterterms to the lagrangian nor do they cancel divergences from analogous graphs where a scalar loop replaces the fermion .",

    ", we have a well defined prescription for understanding the corrections from a more fundamental theory valid at high energies on the effective theories we apply at low energies @xcite .",
    "similarly , we need to consider the size of the error we make in choosing a bunch - davies state when the actual short distance properties of the state are different . to do so requires being able to renormalize the theory in that state .",

    "<S> a spin @xmath0 particle propagating in a de sitter background has a one parameter family of states which transform covariantly under the isometry group of the background . </S>",
    "<S> these states are the fermionic analogues of the @xmath1-vacua for a scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we shall show how using a point - source propagator for a fermion in an @xmath1-state produces divergent perturbative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections can not be used to cancel similar divergences arising from scalar fields in bosonic @xmath1-vacua since they have an incompatible dependence on the external momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the theory can be regularized by modifying the propagator to include an antipodal source . </S>"
