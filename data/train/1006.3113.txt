    "ultraluminous x - ray sources are point sources that appear to exceed the eddington luminosities of stellar - mass compact objects .",
    "they are therefore prime candidates for long - sought intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "ulxs have been studied extensively since their discovery in the early 1980s , and they continue to be the subjects of intense research activity ( miller , fabian , & miller 2004 ; winter , mushotzky , & reynolds 2006 ; hui & krolik 2008 ; king 2008 , 2009 ) .",

    "( 2010 , hereafter i10 ) recently identified very broad and luminous @xmath8 emission in two ulxs harbored by globular clusters in elliptical galaxies ngc 4472 and ngc 1399 , respectively .",
    "the connections to globular clusters are robust , as in both i10 and z08 , we see large redshifts that agree very well with the redshifts of the clusters and their host galaxies .",
    "line widths were 140 and 1500 km  s@xmath9 in the two systems , and line luminosities , assuming the sources radiate isotropically , were @xmath10  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "both z08 and i10 found difficulty simultaneously explaining the line widths and luminosities with an accretion disc around a stellar black hole , the most natural explanation for a consistent source with @xmath11  erg  s@xmath9 .",
    "the observed lines created a tension .",
    "their large line widths suggested rapid rotation very close to the source , while the large luminosities suggested a large line - emitting region and an origin in the outer disc .",
    "the lack of  and  presented further complications in the context of globular clusters .",
    "z08 suggested a stellar black - hole wind is the explanation for rz2109 .",
    "i10 suggested for cxoj033831.8 - 352604 tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an imbh ( fabian , pringle , & rees 1975 ; rosswog , ramirez - ruiz , & hix 2009 ) .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ maxlum ] , we revisit and extend the arguments presented by z08 and i10 , first relaxing the assumption that the line - emitting gas can not be more dense than the critical density of the observed lines .",
    "we derive a simple expression for the maximum line luminosity in an accretion - disc geometry .",
    "our expression is independent of temperature , density , and metallicity , and depends only on rotational velocity and central mass .",
    "while a super - critical density alleviates some of the tension described above , we nonetheless confirm the z08 and i10 conclusions that stellar - mass accretion can not be implicated in either ulx . in section  [ discmass ] , we present bootstrap arguments for the total mass in an accretion disc and obtain lower limits . in section  [ roche ] , we explore the implications for roche - lobe overflow .",
    "here we derive expressions for the maximum line luminosities of the and forbidden lines .",
    "we focus on the lines because they are seen in both objects .",
    "because both and are produced by ions of the carbon isoelectronic sequence , our formalism applies to both .",
    "the final expression is independent of temperature , density , and metallicity and depends only on rotational velocity and central mass .",
    "we assume the gas is photoionized and collisionally excited and begin by writing a simple two - level balance equation    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the populations of the lower and upper levels , @xmath15 is the spontaneous radiative transition probability ( @xmath16 ) from level 2 to level 1 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the collisional excitation and de - excitation coefficients ( @xmath19 ) and are related by @xmath20 .",
    "the critical density @xmath21 is the density at which the collisional de - excitation rate ( @xmath22 ) equals the radiative decay rate . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the radiative decay dominates and the population of level 2 is    @xmath24    for @xmath25 , the usual boltzmann equation of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) applies .",
    "the local emissivity is @xmath26 , and it follows that @xmath27 the critical density marks the transition from the regime where radiative cooling is proportional to @xmath28 to the lte regime where cooling is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "the emitted energy per unit volume per unit time increases monotonically with increasing density .",
    "the two regimes are illustrated in figure  [ fig : emis ] for the @xmath8 line .",
    "the critical density is represented by the knee near @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "both i10 and z08 considered the low - density case , and we have no need to reconsider that here .",
    "the remainder of this work will assume @xmath32 .",
    "authors who have discussed the high - density behavior of emission include nussbaumer & storey ( 1981 ) , keenan & aggarwal ( 1987 ) , kastner & bhatia ( 1989 ) , and osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) . from an observational perspective , we note , for example , andre , dreschel , & starrfield ( 1994 ) found @xmath33 as high as @xmath34@xmath31 from lines in classical novae .",
    "we generalize the high - density emissivity to multi - level configurations by using the o@xmath35 calculations of nussbaumer & storey ( 1981 ) .",
    "their calculations are valid for all practical densities and include temperatures as high @xmath36  k , safely above the temperature of photoionized o@xmath35 gas considered in section  [ discmass ] below .",
    "the upper level of the @xmath8 and @xmath37 transitions is @xmath38 .",
    "the fractional population @xmath39 in table 5 of nussbaumer & storey does not exceed @xmath40 .",
    "a comparable value applies to n@xmath41 , and our emissivities take the maximum value @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the density of the ionization stage .",
    "next we posit a column of gas having local emissivity given by equation  [ final_emis_max ] .",
    "the intensity emitted through the column is @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents position along the column ( or above an annulus perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disc ) . to impose an upper limit on the integration variable ,",
    "we introduce a photon escape probability , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the ( napier ) line - center optical depth .",
    "equation  [ eqn : intensity ] is then written @xmath48 where we have used @xmath49 .",
    "equation  [ eqn : maxintensity ] saturates at @xmath50 , consistent with the rule - of - thumb that we can see into a cloud only up to optical depth unity ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) .",
    "the upper limit corresponds to @xmath51o@xmath35 ) @xmath52  @xmath53 , assuming local line widths are thermal at @xmath54  k. optical depth in the lines causes their relative strengths to decrease from the canonical 3:1 ratio to approximate parity in the optically - thick limit .",
    "this behavior is shown in figure  [ fig : doublet ] .",
    "the plotted ratio is visibly greater than unity in both z08 and i10 .",
    "our limit , therefore , has the consequence of preventing model line - ratios inconsistent with the observations .",
    "note that equation  [ eqn : maxintensity ] does not depend upon density .",
    "the green dashed curve in figure  [ fig : emis ] illustrates this and is an important point in our analysis . above the critical density ,",
    "the intensity emitted through a fixed column density is independent of the volume density of the gas .",
    "this means that , with no penalty on the total intensity , we can increase the density and , with all else fixed , squeeze the gas into a smaller volume , potentially allowing a stellar - mass black hole explanation .",
    "finally , we obtain a maximum luminosity via an effective surface area .",
    "we define the inner radius , @xmath55 , of our line - emitting region by assuming the line - emitting gas is in a keplerian orbit about central mass @xmath56 with velocity @xmath57 ( which we relate to observed line - widths below ) so that @xmath58 we assume the line - emitting region comprises an annulus with width comparable to @xmath55 .",
    "line luminosities are written @xmath59 we evaluate constants , normalize variables to convenient values , and obtain maximum luminosity @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the central mass in units @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the rotational velocity in units @xmath64  km  s@xmath9 , and all constants have been absorbed into fiducial values @xmath65 .",
    "table  [ tab : data ] contains the fiducial luminosities for @xmath8 and @xmath66 .",
    "atomic data used in this section are from wiese , fuhr , & deters ( 1996 ) , as obtained from the nist atomic spectra database ( ralchenko et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that equations  [ eqn : lumline ] and [ eqn : lumline2 ] are independent of temperature , volume density , and metallicity .",
    "this is by design .",
    "however , temperature and metallicity do inform the _ practicality _ of the equations .",
    "we will discuss the former below .",
    "regarding the latter , at fixed @xmath33 , the disc height required to reach a certain column density ( and therefore luminosity ) is inversely proportional to metallicity .",
    "a purely metallic plasma allows the smallest disc height for the maximum - luminosity configuration of our model .",
    "solar metallicity gas requires a disc height more than three orders of magnitude greater , reaching @xmath67 thomson depths .",
    "scattering would yield emergent line widths @xmath68  km  s@xmath9 .",
    "such large widths would contradict our rotational broadening assumption in both ulxs and are ruled out completely by observation in cxoj033831.8 - 352604 .",
    "if the width scales as the number of scatterings ( usually the greater of @xmath47 and @xmath69 ) , this problem would be eliminated by decreasing the column by some factor .",
    "the minimum central mass found below would increase by the square of that factor .    .observed and model luminosities ( erg  s@xmath9 ) .",
    "the last column contains the @xmath65 values defined via equation  [ eqn : lumline2 ] . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : data ]    we plot in figure  [ fig : maxl ] maximum line luminosities as a function of the velocity of the gas at @xmath70 .",
    "several values of the compact object mass are considered .",
    "the middle two lines represent recent theoretical ( @xmath71 ) and observed ( @xmath72 ) upper limits to the mass of a stellar black hole ( belczynski et al .",
    "results for i10 and z08 are indicated by the squares , where we have assumed velocities equal to @xmath73 times the measured fwhm .",
    "this ignores the effect of disc inclination on the observed line widths .",
    "accounting for inclination would mean a greater rotational velocity and a smaller annulus radius ( for a given central mass ) . this would decrease the surface area of the line - emitting region and the luminosity of the line .",
    "the arrow on each square points to the velocity appropriate for the ( arbitrarily chosen ) inclination angle @xmath74 .",
    "the point corresponding to cxoj033831.8 - 352604 in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : maxl ] is beneath the lines corresponding to the theoretical and observed stellar - mass black hole upper limits .",
    "however , the lower panel of figure  [ fig : maxl ] makes a more compelling case .",
    "the observed @xmath75 is very slightly less than ( at edge - on inclination ) the maximum predicted luminosity corresponding to the maximum theoretical mass of a stellar black - hole ( belczynski et al .",
    "note that these predictions assume optimal cooling efficiency .",
    "i10 found @xmath76  k in the emitting region using the lack of @xmath77 .",
    "using this temperature would lower the predictions by a factor @xmath78 and require @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 was neither presented nor mentioned in i10 .",
    "measurement of this line could place a strong constraint on the temperature of the region .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : maxl ] clearly demonstrates that the z08 observations of rz2109 can not be explained as keplerian rotation around a stellar - mass object .",
    "the required mass is at least @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath80 is weakly detected in rz2109 .",
    "a rough estimate is that @xmath8 is at least 10 times greater .",
    "the nussbaumer & storey ( 1981 ) tabulations would then give @xmath82  k at the @xmath8 critical density .",
    "that upper limit quickly decreases to @xmath83  k for @xmath84  @xmath31 .",
    "these considerations depress the maximum luminosity by at least a factor of 20 , so that the minimum central mass is at least @xmath85 .",
    "we rule out stellar black - hole keplerian accretors in both sources .",
    "sub - keplerian motions have orbiting radii that are smaller for a given central mass than keplerian , decreasing the surface area of the line - emitting region and exacerbating the problems discussed above .",
    "we can therefore rule out sub - keplerian , stellar black hole accretion more readily than we can rule out keplerian .",
    "we stress that the two panels of figure  [ fig : maxl ] do not depend upon the relative abundances of oxygen and nitrogen .",
    "the predicted luminosities are noticeably less than the luminosities at the same velocity and central mass .",
    "this is because the lines are less efficient coolants than their counterparts .",
    "here we present a bootstrap argument for the total disc masses in an accretion scenario .",
    "the mass required to emit @xmath86 ( or @xmath75 ) is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the mass of a single atom with mass number @xmath89 .",
    "this is independent of the geometrical model and the gas density ( even below @xmath90 ) , and accounts only for the population in the upper level of the transition .",
    "observed values of @xmath91 are listed in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "the lines require masses @xmath92 and @xmath93 for cxoj033831.8 - 352604 and rz2109 , respectively .",
    "the lines in cxoj033831.8 - 352604 require @xmath94",
    ".    we can bootstrap our way to a total disc mass via @xmath95 where @xmath39 was discussed in section  [ maxlum ] and @xmath96 is the c - like ionization fraction , which we estimate using the well - known plasma simulation code cloudy ( version c08 , last described by ferland et al .",
    "figure  [ ionfracs ] plots the results for oxygen as a function of the temperature of a bright blackbody photoionization source .",
    "the fraction in o@xmath35 peaks around @xmath97  k. the maximum equivalent width of @xmath8 with @xmath98(o@xmath35)@xmath99  @xmath53 against a blackbody of the same area and @xmath100  k is about @xmath101 .",
    "we estimate from spectra in i10 and z08 observed equivalent widths of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "blackbody sources with weak enough continuum at @xmath104  are too weak to ionize o@xmath105 .",
    "we require a harder continuum .",
    "we instead consider , again using cloudy , a power - law continuum with spectral index @xmath106 ( following x - ray continuum fits in i10 ) .",
    "figure  [ ionfracs2 ] plots both oxygen and nitrogen ionization fractions as a function of electron temperature .",
    "the ionization parameter ranges from @xmath107 .",
    "the fractions @xmath96 and @xmath39 depend on temperature .",
    "we relate them to the variable of integration @xmath108 via the standard shakura - sunyaev prescription ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the ratio of integrals in equation  [ bootstrap ] is illustrated by the dotted blue curves in figure  [ accum ] .",
    "the result depends on the upper limit of integration .",
    "the peak is @xmath110 for both oxygen and nitrogen .",
    "the curves decline as @xmath111 at large radii .",
    "an important conclusion can be derived from figures  [ ionfracs2 ] and [ accum ] .",
    "the regions emitting and are mostly non - cospatial .",
    "the details depend on the ionizing source and the geometry .",
    "since the second ionization energy of nitrogen is only @xmath112 of the second ionization energy of oxygen , the basic result is fairly robust .",
    "n@xmath41 always peaks at a temperature significantly less than the temperature of the o@xmath35 peak .",
    "if the standard @xmath0-disc is applicable , we have @xmath109 .",
    "keplerian rotation gives @xmath113 , so @xmath114 .",
    "a series of tests suggests the and line widths should differ by a factor @xmath115 .",
    "the widths are uncertain but appear comparable in the i10 observations .",
    "this argues against keplerian rotation about _ any _ central mass in cxoj033831.8 - 352604 . a very steep temperature gradient or a thermal instability between the and regions could mitigate this problem .",
    "high - resolution spectroscopy would be useful in efforts to address such questions .",
    "finally , we require the density of oxygen relative to the total gas density .",
    "assuming metallicity is independent of radius , we can write @xmath116 where @xmath117 is atomic mass number . for fixed relative metal abundances ,",
    "the fraction of mass in oxygen varies from @xmath118 with solar abundances ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ) to @xmath119 for all metals .    combining the above results , we find @xmath120",
    "this corresponds to the purely metallic case . if we assume roughly solar abundances , @xmath121 .",
    "an estimate for the upper limit is not readily apparent in either system because we have no way of estimating the outer radius and , in particular , because the line - emitting gas could be only a thin outermost layer of the disc .",
    "in steady roche - lobe overflow accretion , the disc mass must be replenished on the viscous time - scale @xmath122 where the mass - accretion rate @xmath123 and @xmath124 is an efficiency typically taken to be @xmath125 .",
    "we can also consider the viscous time - scale in a standard @xmath0-disc .",
    "we manipulate the familiar expression ( frank , king , & raine 2002 ) , substituting azimuthal velocity for the radius via equation  [ rnot ] , and obtain @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the mass accretion rate in units @xmath128",
    "g  s@xmath9 . for the x - ray luminosities given in table  [ tab : data ]",
    ", we find @xmath129 g  s@xmath9 ( @xmath130  yr@xmath9 ) .    if we assume the `` edge - on '' velocities discussed in relation to figure  [ fig : maxl ] and @xmath131 , equations  [ tvisc ] and [ tvisc2 ] require masses @xmath132 and @xmath133 for cxoj033831.8 - 352604 and rz2109 , respectively .",
    "these numbers are surprisingly similar to the minimum masses found in section  [ maxlum ] .",
    "the minimum masses are @xmath134 times larger if the disc has @xmath135 .",
    "the viscous time - scale @xmath136  yr .    temperatures derived with the @xmath0-disc prescription , standard assumptions , and the above limits are too cold by a factor @xmath137 .",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath138 , and @xmath0 all enter as fairly weak powers and offer no obvious solution .",
    "irradiation of a surface layer ( e.g. , dubus et al .",
    "1999 ) might yield the necessary temperatures .",
    "can a globular cluster form and sustain the massive accretion discs implied by the observed luminosities ? combining the minimum masses obtained in section  [ maxlum ] with the rotational velocities derived above , we obtain @xmath139 and @xmath140  cm , for cxoj033831.8 - 352604 and rz2109 , respectively .",
    "we take this as the distance from the center of the compact object to the lagrange point @xmath141 .",
    "we then assume a @xmath142 donor star ( giving mass ratios @xmath143 and @xmath144 ) and employ approximations from eggleton ( 1983 ) and frank , king & raine ( 2002 ) , and we obtain donor roche lobe radii @xmath145 and @xmath146  cm , respectively .",
    "these radii are comfortably within the size limits of the red giants that are common in globular clusters , but they represent lower limits .",
    "larger central object masses would correspond to larger overflow radii ( because the dependence of @xmath147 on @xmath56 via @xmath148 is not enough to overcome @xmath149 ) .",
    "white dwarfs have been mentioned because of the apparent high - metallicity in both systems . with prototypical @xmath150 and @xmath151  cm , we can _ strongly _ exclude white dwarfs as roche - lobe overflow donors in either system .",
    "does the envelope of a red giant contain enough oxygen to produce the observed line luminosities ?",
    "carretta & gratton ( 1997 ) considered the metallicities of red giants in 24 galactic globular clusters .",
    "they found sub - solar metallicities for every star in their study .",
    "the majority were sub - solar by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the most metal - rich had @xmath135 .",
    "the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 and [ nii]/h@xmath0 values i10 observed in cxoj033831.8 - 352604 ( @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively ) and the [ oiii]/h@xmath1 value z08 observed in rz2109 ( @xmath154 ) are not necessarily indicative of high - metallicity gas . the photoionized gas near the center of the giant hii region 30 doradus has @xmath135 and [ oiii]/h@xmath155 ( pellegrini et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "elevated ratios are often thought to be signs of radiative shock heating ( e.g. , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) , as was noted by z08 .",
    "detailed attempts to distinguish between enhanced abundances and non - equilibrium heating processes are probably unwarranted without better observational constraints .",
    "a further complication pertains to whether the line - emitting gas is radiation- or matter - bound ( mccall , rybski , & shields 1985 ) , although the high observed [ nii]/h@xmath0 would seem to make the latter less likely in cxoj033831.8 - 352604 .",
    "if z08 are correct in their black - hole wind explanation of rz2109 , we offer without comment the suggestion that the observed very broad line - widths may be the low - resolution appearance of narrow emission lines atop broader ones as in a two - wind structure ( e.g. , fernandes 1999 ) .",
