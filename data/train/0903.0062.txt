    "more than 40 years ago the basic principles of _ intensity interferometry _ were developed and proven through the measurement of stellar diameters with sub - milli - arcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "yet this breakthrough ran its course due to technological limitations .",
    "the old technology was limited to two telescope beams , and integration of correlations was done by the elegantly primitive device of counting the turns of an electric motor . in the interim",
    "the technology of photon detection has exploded , and the ability to handle and correlate multiple beams with exquisite time resolution has been perfected .",
    "it is hard to overstate the advantages now possible with current and future detection technology , both in real - time and off - line , both with simple pairs and with multiple detector arrays .",
    "@xmath1 works by comparing the random intensity fluctuations of light waves entering separated detectors .",
    "nothing special is needed from the source , and black - body , thermal correlations are ideal . while quantum properties derived from the statistics of photon arrival times ( e.g. photon bunching behavior ) add extra information , the effect is robust , and works whether or not quanta are well - resolved .",
    "statistical correlations of beams of a given wavelength @xmath2 separated by a given distance @xmath3 allows resolution of structure at the rayleigh criterion @xmath4 .",
    "this is how measurements equivalent to 100 meter telescopes were made with @xmath1 40 years ago @xcite .",
    "the exacting match of optical path lengths needed in amplitude ( michelson ) interferometry is completely unnecessary , because different phase properties dominate @xmath1 .",
    "troublesome sensitivity to path length differences caused by atmospheric turbulence is completely eliminated for the same reason .",
    "vast quantities of photons are however required and the visual wavelength region is most appropriate .",
    "several algorithms are available for phase recovery in a multi - beam set - up , permitting model independent imaging @xcite .",
    "current detection technology allow therefore a revolution in @xmath1 : multiple telescope , long baseline optical _ intensity interferometry_. a system can be devised @xcite that would consist of hundreds of large flux gathering surfaces spread out over kilometers of baseline that would enable to make the next big step in astronomy : optical imaging at @xmath5-arcsecond resolution .",
    "properly imaging stellar surfaces constitutes a major break - through in stellar astrophysics .",
    "stars have angular sizes of tens of milli - arcseconds or less , and until now , apart from the sun , only betelgeuse and altair have been imaged albeit with a modest number of resolution elements ( at maximum ten ) .",
    "technical requirements for @xmath1 are such that one can easily be looking at hundred resolution elements with an order of magnitude increase in angular resolution .",
    "stellar physics has been waiting for a long time to make this leap forward , and it is similar to the impact realized by hanbury brown and twiss when they measured 32 stellar diameters with the first and only application of @xmath1 in astronomy @xcite .",
    "modern @xmath1 would undoubtedly extend solar physics to the realm of the stars .",
    "moreover , feasibility studies indicate that @xmath1 may not be limited to resolving galactic sources only .",
    "we present therefore an overview of core galactic and extra - galactic science drivers :    * stellar surface phenomena and dynamo action * conditions for planet formation around young stars * cepheid properties and the distance scale * mass loss and fast rotation of massive hot stars and supernova progenitors * nuclear optical emission from agn * structure of gamma - ray bursts    of course , feasibility of these science topics depends on the design of the intensity interferometer . for practical purposes we adopt a conservative limiting visual magnitude @xmath6 and a resolution of a 0.1 milli - arcsecond , and we detail the science that would be opened up within these limits .

    "spatially resolved studies would involve the absolute calibration of pms tracks , the mass accretion process , continuum emission variability , and stellar magnetic activity .",
    "the technique may allow spot features on the stellar surface to be resolved .",
    "hot spots deliver direct information regarding the accretion of material onto the stellar surface .",
    "cool spots , on the other hand , may cover 50% of the stellar surface , and they are the product of the slowly decaying rapid rotation of young stars",
    ". imaging them will constrain the interplay of rotation , convection , and chromospheric activity as traced by cool spots and need not be limited to pms stars only .",
    "it may also provide direct practical application as the explanation for the anomalous photometry observed in young stars @xcite .    in the last decade",
    "several young coeval stellar groups have been discovered in close proximity ( @xmath750pc ) to the sun .",
    "famous examples are the tw hydra and @xmath8 pic comoving groups .",
    "the majority of the spectral types within reach range between a and g - type , and about 50 young stars have @xmath9 .",
    "their ages lie within the range 8 to 50 myr ( see for an overview ) .",
    "the age intervals ensures that a substantial fraction of the low - mass members are still in their pms contraction phase .",
    "key targets for calibration of evolutionary pms tracks in the hertzsprung - russell diagram are spectroscopic binaries . resolving binaries delivers the inclination of the system and hence access to the mass of the components .",
    "this is a fundamental exercise not only for pms stars but for all spectroscopic binaries in any evolutionary stage .",
    "measurement of angular sizes of individual pms stars in combination with a distance estimate ( e.g. gaia ) allows a direct comparison between predicted and observed sizes of these gravitationally contracting stars .",
    "the proximity of the comoving groups ensures that their members are bright .",
    "their proximity renders the comoving group also relatively sparse making them very suitable , unconfused targets .",
    "the sparseness is also the reason for incomplete group memberships , making it likely that the number of young stars close to the sun will increase with the years to come .",

    "a radius estimate of a cepheid can be obtained using the baade - wesselink method .",
    "the baade - wesselink method relies on the measurement of the ratio of the star size at times @xmath10 and @xmath11 , based on the luminosity and color .",

    "in addition the stars show balmer line emission firmly established as due to gaseous circumstellar disks , that appear and disappear on timescales of months to years .",
    "photometric observations of be star disks seem to indicate that they may actually evolve into ring structures before disappearing into the interstellar medium ( e.g. ) .",
    "these two phenomena ( rapid rotation and circumstellar disks ) are somehow related , but many open questions exist regarding the detailed physical processes at play .",
    "the be - phenomenon is important given the large number of stars and fundamental stellar physics involved ( fraction of be stars to normal b - type peaks at nearly 50% for b0 stars , ) .",
    "absorption line studies can not provide the final answer to their actual rotational velocity due to strong gravity darkening at the equator and brightening at the pole areas .",
    "direct measurement of the shape of the rotating star is not hampered by gravity darkening , and can provide a direct indication of the rotational speed ( see @xmath13eri with the vlti , ) .",
    "the disk s bremsstrahlung can constitute @xmath14 of the total light in @xmath15-band .",
    "there are about 300 be stars[multiblock footnote omitted ] brighter than @xmath16 , roughly corresponding to a distance limit of 700pc .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of an optical intensity interferometer improves with the temperature of the target .",
    "since @xmath1 is insensitive to atmospheric turbulence , observations in the violet or blue pose no problem .",
    "eliminating the `` achilles heel '' of standard phase interferometry will enable high resolution studies of hot stars over very long geometric baselines .",
    "a rough estimate of the effective temperatures of the objects in the bright star catalog reveals that approximately 2600 stars brighter than visual magnitude 7 and hotter than 9000k exist in the sky , all of which should be realistic targets even for a fairly modest intensity interferometer .",
    "typical angular sizes for the stellar surface disk range between 0.5 and 5 mas . of these targets , a handful of especially interesting ones are presented below , along with some brief notes on their possible science potential .    * * rigel ( @xmath8 orionis ) * rigel is the nearest blue supergiant ( 240pc ) .",
    "it is a very dynamic object with variable absorption / emission lines and oscillations on many different timescales - from minutes to weeks @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of rigel have recently been shown to be very similar to the supernova progenitor sn1987a .",
    "this realization makes understanding the dynamical nature of rigel highly relevant . * * @xmath8 centauri * @xmath8 centauri is a binary system consisting of two very hot , very massive variable stars .",
    "both components are variable both spatially and in their line profiles . the intricate nature of the system has led to it being called `` a challenge for current evolution scenarios in close binaries '' .",
    "* * vega ( @xmath13 lyrae ) * while one of the most fundamental stars in the sky for calibration purposes , the nature of vega has proven to be more complicated than previously thought .",
    "recent phase interferometry studies suggest an 18-fold drop in intensity at 500 nm from center to limb , consistent with a rapidly rotating pole - on model , as contrasted to the 5-fold drop predicted by non - rotating models @xcite .",
    "intensity interferometry will direct studies of the intensity distribution at shorter wavelengths and in different passbands .",
    "such observations will lead to a better understanding between the link between rotation and limb darkening in different wavelength regions .",
    "* * @xmath17 carinae * @xmath17 carinae is the most luminous star known in the galaxy , and an extremely unstable and complex object .",
    "recent vlti studies have revealed asymmetries in the stellar winds due to the rapid rotation of the star .",
    "like rigel , @xmath17 carinae is believed to be on the verge of exploding as a core - collapse supernova . * * @xmath18 velorum * @xmath18 velorum is a binary consisting of a hot o - type star and a wolf - rayet star .",
    "the proximity to the o - type star creates a situation where two stellar winds interact , creating a wealth of interesting phenomena such as wind collision zones , wind - blown cavities and eclipses of spectral lines .",
    "the bright emission lines of wr stars make them suitable for comparative studies in different passbands , as discussed above .",
    "[ [ optical - emission - from - agn ] ] * optical emission from agn * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    nuclear optical continuum emission from agn is visible whenever there is a direct view of the accretion disc ( although jets can also contribute to this component ) .",
    "ngc1068 is among the brightest and the most nearby active galaxy ( 18.5mpc ) , and hence the prototypical agn .",
    "the core of the galaxy is very luminous not only in the optical , but also in ultraviolet and x - rays , and a supermassive black hole is required to account for the nuclear activity .",
    "the vlti has succeeded in resolving structures in the agn torus at mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite on scales of 30 milli - arcsecond .",
    "on the other hand , the blue optical continuum emission is dominated by thermal emission from the inner accretion disk ( the source of the `` big blue bump '' in many quasars ) and much more compact .",
    "the optical emission regions have an expected size of 0.3 milli - arcsecond at the distance of ngc1068 and resolving it would be a fantastic achievement .",

    "initial models assumed clashes between expanding shells to explain these bright events @xcite , and later concentrated on polar shells .",
    "another model tried to explain the effect by assuming relativistic plasma spheres in which directionality sets all these observed parameters .",
    "resolution is required to decide between the many models for these hot spots .",
    "the currently available high - spatial resolution instruments are all insufficient as amplitude interferometers can not operate on long enough baselines in the crucial blue and ultraviolet regime @xcite .",
    "early warning systems will allow to obtain some spatial and spectral information at the peak of the optical flux .",
    "since most of these events are extremely far , we can expect only those within z@xmath20 to be resolvable .",
    "there have been at least two such bright ( @xmath21 ) objects , grb990123 and grb080319b , and there are others ( e.g. grb050509b ) with host galaxies , all of which are of interest .",
    "the major observational advantages of an intensity interferometer are its low requirements on path length equalization and its relative insensitivity to atmospheric seeing .",
    "however traditional implementation has required huge quantities of light .",

    "iact @xmath22-ray observations are done with a low duty cycle due to a requirement for low night - sky background light levels excluding moonlight.meanwhile @xmath1 observations in narrow optical bands are much less affected by the background the @xmath1 exploitation of large iact arrays will close to double their operational duty cycle for a modest additional cost",
