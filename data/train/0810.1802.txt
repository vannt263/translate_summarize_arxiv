    "the photon emission from high energy electron and electron - positron pair creation by a photon are the basic electrodynamics processes in oriented crystal at high energy .",
    "the probabilities of these processes are strongly enhanced comparing with the corresponding amorphous medium @xcite .",
    "the photon emitted by electron can produce the electron - positron pair ( the electroproduction or the trident production process ) .",
    "an analysis of this process is of evident interest as example of higher order qed process in an oriented crystal .",
    "this process is the first step of the electromagnetic cascade developed in a crystal by the incident electron ( the cascade processes in oriented crystals was considered in @xcite , see also sec.20 in @xcite ) , it possesses many important peculiarities which will be discussed below .",
    "recently authors developed a new approach to analysis of pair creation by a photon @xcite and radiation from high energy electrons @xcite in oriented crystals .",
    "this approach permits to consider simultaneously both the coherent and incoherent mechanisms of these processes . for calculation of the energy spectrum",
    "of created particle in the trident production process one has to integrate over spectrum of emitted photons .",
    "this means that both the mentioned mechanisms ( contributing in the different parts of photon spectrum ) should be taken into consideration and the developed approach is very suitable for solution of the problem .",
    "one has to consider two different contributions into the probability of the process .",
    "the first one is the direct(one - step ) electroproduction of pair via the virtual intermediate photon .",
    "the second one is the cascade(two - step ) process when an electron emits the real photon moving in the field of axis and afterwards the photon converts into the pair .",
    "the interrelation of these contributions depends on the target thickness @xmath0 since the probability of the direct process is proportional to @xmath0 while the probability of the cascade process is proportional to @xmath1 . in oriented crystals",
    "the real photon emission is strongly enhanced .",

    "the increase of the enhancement with the positron energy growth for the given thickness is due to more fast decreasing of the probability in an amorphous medium . in the positron energy interval under consideration in an amorphous medium",

    "the spectral intensity eq.([c4 ] ) , which describes the radiation in the crystal field ( the coherent radiation ) , is in quite satisfactory agreement with the spectral curves in fig.1 not far from maximum .",

    "for very soft photons @xmath146 all the interval @xmath147 contributes . in the limiting case @xmath148 one",

    "the obtained probability is 20%-30% higher than the direct calculation of eq.([c1 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the whole spectrum of emitted photons ( not only the vicinity of the maximum ) is contributed into the final electroproduction probability and the tails of the curve eq.([c4 ] ) are higher than the spectrum eq.([r1 ] ) .",
    "the exact calculation of eq.([c1 ] ) , which is the 5-fold integral , is quite cumbersome .",
    "we used the interpolated photon spectrum ( the accuracy of interpolation is better than 1% ) to simplify the calculation . when one uses the explicit expression eq.([c1a ] ) for the pair photoproduction probability",

    "the accuracy of the result is quite satisfactory .",
    "the simplest calculation ( the 1-fold integral ) is with use of the probabilities eq.([c4 ] ) and eq.([c1a ] ) , but the result can be considered as a rough approximation only .",
    "the process of the electroproduction of electron - positron pair ( the trident production ) in an oriented crystal is considered for the first time .",
    "it is shown that due to the strong enhancement of photon emission in an oriented crystal ( this is the coherent radiation , see fig.1 ) the electroproduction probability is also enhanced ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the scale of the enhancement in the soft part of created particles spectrum ( @xmath152 ) is similar to the photon emission enhancement .",
    "this is connected with the fact that in this part of the spectrum the standard incoherent ( bethe - maximon ) mechanism of pair creation by a photon ( which is weakly dependent on photon energy ) dominates ( see e.g. eq.([c1a ] ) ) .",
    "for very high energy of incident electron ( @xmath153 ) there is an additional enhancement in the hard part of created particles spectrum due to the coherent pair creation mechanism ( see curve 2 in fig.2 ) .",
    "indeed the enhancement @xmath154 of the cascade process ( the ratio of the electroproduction probability in the germanium crystal , axis @xmath69 , t=293 k and of the electroproduction probability in the amorphous germanium ) for the initial electron energy @xmath80gev attains @xmath155 at @xmath156 .",
    "this is because the both factors of the enhancement are acting : the coherent radiation @xmath157 and the coherent pair creation @xmath157 .",

    "has @xmath160 at @xmath107gev .",
    "this is because the both factors of the enhancement are acting : the coherent radiation @xmath161 and the coherent pair creation @xmath161 . from the other side @xmath162 at @xmath104gev",
    "this is because the coherent pair creation is not acting entirely at this electron energy as it was explained above .    in the germanium crystal ( axis @xmath69 , t=293 k ) due to the action of the coherent mechanism of photon emission",
    "the crystal radiation length is @xmath163 mm for the energy @xmath78gev .",
    "so the targets used in cern experiment consist 40% and 17% of the crystal radiation length @xmath164 and the energy loss of the incident electron should be analyzed .",
    "using the approach developed in @xcite one can calculate the energy loss . for the initial energy @xmath78gev one",
    "has the final energy @xmath165gev for the target thickness @xmath113 and for the target thickness @xmath114 the final energy @xmath166gev .",
    "so the energy loss is very essential .",
    "however , the radiation spectra for these electron energies ( shown in fig.1 ) are very close to each other as it was indicated above .",
    "since for electron energy @xmath167gev and for @xmath152 the incoherent pair creation gives the main contribution , one can expect that the influence of the energy loss on the created positron spectrum will be quite weak .",
    "the positron spectra for corresponding electron energies are shown in fig.7 .",
    "the maximal difference ( for the positron energy @xmath168=0.5   gev ) is 8.6% .",
    "taking into account the weak dependence of the positron spectrum on the initial electron energy one can use the average energy @xmath169 for estimation of electron energy inside the targets . for the target thickness @xmath114",
    "one has @xmath170gev and the influence of the energy loss will be @xmath171% for this thickness at @xmath168=0.5   gev and smaller ( up to 0 ) at the higher positron energies ( @xmath17210  gev ) . for the target thickness",
    "@xmath113 the influence will be @xmath173% at @xmath168=0.5   gev and correspondingly smaller at higher positron energies .",
    "so we arrive to the paradoxical conclusion : in spite of essential energy loss by the initial electron in the targets the created positron spectrum depends very weakly on the energy loss in the case of not very high electron energy @xmath2gev and @xmath152 .",
