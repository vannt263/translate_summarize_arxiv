    "the process of compaction in granular media attracts a great deal of attention in the scientific community , in particular amongst physicists and chemical engineers .",
    "in fact it displays features that are general enough to make it suitable for investigation through models that are relatively simple , at least for a non equilibrium process .",
    "granular compaction therefore appears appealing for testing new promising and unifying ideas in the field of disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "grains poured into a vessel fill it with loose arrangements and relatively low densities .",
    "the action of external perturbations , like shaking and tapping , in the presence of an external driving , like the gravity field , leads to a very slow increase of density through a rich phenomenology , displaying different regimes and both reversible and irreversible dynamical phases  @xcite .",
    "a number of different lattice models have been recently investigated in order to unravel the microscopic mechanisms producing such behaviors , and to clarify to which extent they may be considered general , also in relation to other disordered systems like glasses  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we introduce a lattice gas model for dimer compaction which includes , besides the vertical , also horizontal shaking and friction .",
    "friction , although playing a fundamental role in real granular systems , has not been introduced so far in models for compaction .",
    "horizontal shaking has been considered only experimentally for non brownian spheres where it seems to favor local dense crystalline order  @xcite .",
    "highly anisotropic granulars , namely rods , have been recently investigated under vertical shaking .",
    "in contrast to sphere packings which tend to end up in disordered configurations , evidence is found that the particle anisotropy drives ordering  @xcite .",
    "we try to incorporate in our model , albeit in a simplified manner , all these aspects , namely particle anisotropy , horizontal shaking and frictional dynamics , which we find to affect significantly the compaction process .",
    "in particular , our model is based on the diffusional dynamics of dimers , considered as rigid and non overlapping particles which occupy two lattice sites on a square lattice .",
    "the model has no quenched disorder , but for this type of dynamics glass - like properties may be expected  @xcite , because of the onset of geometrically frustrated configurations .",
    "since the number of states with the closest packed density is exponentially large in the lattice size @xcite , this model is intrinsically different from the other lattice models recently investigated  @xcite and is suitable to understand how horizontal shaking and friction may influence the general characteristics attributed to the compaction process .    in the next section",
    "we describe in detail the model and the monte carlo method that we used . in sec .",
    "[ sec.dynamics ] we discuss the results for the compaction dynamics without friction and illustrate the evolution of the packing structure . in sec .",
    "[ sec.friction ] we introduce the effect of friction and show its crucial role in the dynamical behavior .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "we consider a square lattice of @xmath5 sites , with lateral periodic boundary conditions , an open boundary at the top and a rigid wall at the bottom .",
    "elongated particles occupying two consecutive lattice sites ( dimers ) are inserted from the top one at the time with random ( horizontal or vertical ) orientation , letting them fall down keeping their orientation fixed , until reaching a stable position .    in this way we are able to prepare the system in an initial state which is saturated , i.e.",
    "no more particles can be put in , and with statistically reproducible density @xmath6 , i.e. characterized by a precise mean value , @xmath7 , corresponding to a random loose packing . in the present model , particles are subjected only to geometrical interactions , and the non - overlapping condition produces strong constraints on their relative positions ( see fig .",
    "[ f.1 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the system in presence of gravity and external vibrations , with the possibility of taking into account also a friction - like force for horizontal displacements . for this purpose",
    "we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations introducing a random diffusive dynamics in our model , which mimics the aforementioned forces and preserves the geometrical constraints . at this stage , we consider separately horizontal and vertical dimers and keep their orientation fixed without allowing rotations .",
    "we plan to introduce this feature , which would make the model more realistic , in the future .",
    "we consider in detail a single tap applied to the system for a fixed time @xmath1 , comparing it with the multiple tapping for selected cases ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we first describe the dynamics without friction .",
    "the dynamics can be divided into two stages : @xmath8 for @xmath9 particles can move horizontally ( left or right with probability @xmath10 ) and vertically ( upwards with probability @xmath11 or downwards with probability @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 for @xmath14 only downward movement of particles is possible ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath17 can be thought of as the quench rate of an initially annealed system .",
    "the probabilities for the different moves are normalized : @xmath18 .",
    "physically @xmath12 corresponds to the action of gravity , while @xmath19 and @xmath11 represent respectively the horizontal and vertical component of the external tap .",
    "the functional form chosen for the time dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath11 is  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the heaviside function ( the same expression holds for @xmath22 , with @xmath23 instead of @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 is determined from the normalization condition : @xmath26 where @xmath27 . since @xmath28 @xmath29 it must be @xmath30 .",
    "if not stated explicitly otherwise , we assume @xmath31 , so @xmath24 results to be @xmath32 , that is only one independent input parameter is needed . in each",
    "mc move one extracts a particle with uniform probability , chooses a move for this particle according to the values of @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and performs the move if all the geometrical constraints are satisfied .",
    "one mc time step ( mcs ) corresponds to @xmath33 attempted moves . in the following , time is always given in units of mcs . to save cpu time we used an algorithm in which the attempted moves are always successful , and consistently updated time through probabilistic arguments ( for the details of our computation see ref .",
    "@xcite on a reaction - diffusion model for dimers ) .",
    "we performed our mc simulations on a lattice with @xmath34 , for which we checked that finite size effects are negligible .",
    "as a next step we introduce friction between adjacent horizontal layers in the material in the following simplified way : the effective probability of making a horizontal move is set to @xmath35 @xmath36t/\\tau ] \\theta ( t_0(\\mu)-t)\\ ] ] where @xmath37,\\ ] ] @xmath38 acts as a friction coefficient ( @xmath39 ) and the `` friction force '' is proportional to the load , represented by the net vertical force , reducing the probability of the move .",
    "this assumption implies that the frictional force occurs only for horizontal moves , independently of whether an underlying dimer ( i.e. a dimer in the adjacent lower row ) is present",
    ". we are aware that this is a simplified approximation , but it is meant as a first step in describing this complex process . to ensure @xmath40 at @xmath41 , @xmath38 has to satisfy the condition @xmath42 in addition , for the friction force to give a negative contribution to @xmath19 , one must have @xmath43 @xmath29 ( this is automatically satisfied with our choice @xmath31 ) .",
    "note that the normalization of the frictionless probabilities is still @xmath44 .",
    "in other terms we have introduced a `` sticking '' probability ( probability that the particle does not move ) @xmath45 , given by @xmath46 .",
    "if we put @xmath47 we recover the frictionless case .",
    "we have analyzed the time behavior of the mean density of the system @xmath48 ( number of occupied sites normalized to the total number of sites ) by measuring it in the lower @xmath49 of the box at time @xmath50 . in this way we are sure to measure density at the bulk , since fluctuations can increase significantly in the proximity of the open boundary , resulting in a quite complicated compaction behavior in this region  @xcite .",
    "since the statistical fluctuations of the density can be quite relevant we have performed several mc realizations ( up to @xmath51 ) of the process in order to obtain reliable results . after preparing the system in its low density configuration ( @xmath52 ) ,",
    "the diffusive dynamics starts as described in the previous section .",
    "@xmath24 is chosen as input parameter and consequently @xmath53 .",
    "we stop the simulations when a steady asymptotic value @xmath54 of the density is reached .",
    "we have studied the density evolution for different values of @xmath24 and of the shaking time @xmath1 , in order to find out if some kind of scaling law , describing the behavior of the final density as a function of these parameters , exists . as far as we know ,",
    "no systematic study concerning this point has been performed .",
    "the time behavior of the density for several choices of @xmath1 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] , where a relatively low value of @xmath24 has been used ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we have observed that the dynamics gets drastically slower when @xmath1 increases ; actually , because of our shaking rule , eq .",
    "( [ e.ph ] ) , when a long tap is applied the density does not significantly change in the first steps of the process , but the evolution takes place on a much wider time scale and finally a larger value of the asymptotic density is achieved . we have tried to fit different functional forms to the data in fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] , looking in particular at the relaxation functions proposed in the seminal experimental paper of ref .",
    "it is clear that the observed dynamical behavior is very complex and is not compatible with a single relaxation time , i.e. a simple exponential .",
    "we have found that the commonly claimed inverse logarithmic relaxation does not hold for our system in the single tap case . instead , the most suitable functional form for our data is a stretched exponential , as proposed by nicodemi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the single tapping dynamics : @xmath56\\ ] ] where the fit parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 depend in principle both on @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "actually , it turns from our fits that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are almost independent of @xmath1 and @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "[ f.3](a ) we show the density evolution for a small value of @xmath1 .",
    "as it can be seen , the intermediate - long time behavior can be accurately fitted by eq .",
    "( [ e.stretexp ] ) ( all fits have been performed for @xmath63 ) . as @xmath1 increases , however , eq .  ( [ e.stretexp ] ) fails to reproduce the long time regime .",
    "in fact , a power law tail develops , indicating that the compaction process slows down at long times for large shaking duration .",

    "[ f.3](b ) for @xmath65 .",
    "fit ( [ e.powlaw ] ) has been applied for @xmath66 .",
    "the exponent @xmath67 of this power law can be considered independent of @xmath1 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "however the stretched exponential function still describes the density behavior in the intermediate time regime well .",
    "we have also studied the density relaxation for different values of @xmath24 at fixed @xmath1 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the corresponding plots are shown in fig .",
    "[ f.4 ] , where it is clear that the role of the horizontal shaking amplitude is crucial in determining the asymptotic density .",
    "moreover we have considered the effect of different ratios @xmath70 on the density evolution , which we show in fig .",
    "[ f.5 ] . when @xmath71 we observe a decompaction at the beginning of the process , which becomes more pronounced if the vertical tap is stronger .",
    "this reflects the fact that , in the initial transient , density decreases at the bottom of the container for a strong tap .",
    "such a decompaction upon vertical acceleration increase seems to be a genuine feature of two - dimensional systems , as claimed in  @xcite .",
    "the saturation density is also sensitive to variations of @xmath23 and decreases for increasing @xmath70 .",
    "however , the scaling behavior does not change and the density evolution can still be described by eq .",
    "[ e.stretexp ] , but with a smaller value of @xmath60 with respect to the case @xmath72 ( @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 ) .",
    "in order to gain a better understanding of the degree of compaction of the system , we investigated the dependence of the saturation density @xmath54 on @xmath1 and @xmath24 .",
    "the data for @xmath54 vs. @xmath1 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f.6](a ) .    a crossover from a power law scaling to a logarithmic behavior is observed at a characteristic value @xmath79 : @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "this means that for large values of @xmath1 the process gets slower and slower , as observed before , eventually reaching a final value of the density @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( which corresponds to about the maximal density for the system  @xcite ) .",
    "the variation of @xmath54 with respect to the ratio @xmath89 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f.6](b ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath54 is more pronounced for low values of @xmath90 , while it tends to saturate afterwards .",
    "this compares qualitatively well to the experimental results for a horizontally shaken box filled with beads  @xcite , where it was found that for low filling rates the packing crystallizes upon increase of the adimensional parameter @xmath91 ( where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the amplitude and pulsation of the vibration and @xmath94 is the gravitational acceleration ) , which roughly corresponds to @xmath95 .    in fig .",
    "[ f.7 ] we show some snapshots of one particular realization of the compaction process for @xmath65 .",
    "we see how the packing evolves from a highly disordered state at @xmath41 to a polycrystalline state , made of many crystalline ordered domains , at the end of the compaction .",
    "as time increases the order proceeds from the bottom to the top of the packing while empty spaces reduce in size .",
    "the final state is therefore characterized by the presence of large clusters of horizontal and vertical dimers . in order to demonstrate that the shaking amplitude @xmath24 and time @xmath1 play a significant role , we have reported in fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] a comparison between the final configurations for @xmath55 and @xmath96 at fixed @xmath69 ( upper part ) , and for @xmath97 and @xmath65 at fixed @xmath55 ( lower part ) .",
    "we notice that an intense or / and long tap is effective in locally removing frozen configurations through collective rearrangements of particles , thus letting the defects migrate towards the free surface of the packing .",
    "we have also investigated in detail the behavior of the parameters of the stretched exponential fit ( eq .  ( [ e.stretexp ] ) ) @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which is reported in fig .",
    "[ f.9 ] .",
    "we have observed a change of behavior in correspondence of the critical value of the shaking time @xmath2 , the same value determining the change in the behavior of @xmath54 vs. @xmath1 described in eq .",

    "it is remarkable that both @xmath58 and @xmath59 vary linearly with @xmath1 for @xmath111 and both follow a power law with the same exponent @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "this could mean that they are both determined by the same relaxation mechanism as @xmath1 changes ( i.e. if we define @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 , we see from eqs .  ( [ e.fitt0 ] ) and ( [ e.fittau0 ] ) that @xmath118 and @xmath119 are constants independent of @xmath1 ) .",
    "we note that the critical shaking time @xmath2 physically signals the crossover between two different regimes .",
    "in fact , a careful inspection of fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] shows that , for @xmath111 , compaction occurs after the shaking ( when @xmath120 and @xmath16 ) and is mainly driven by gravity . on the other hand , when @xmath113 , the compaction time ( @xmath121 ) , i.e. the time needed to reach the saturation density , is shorter than @xmath1 , and vibrations act on the system till the end of the process ( see fig .",
    "[ f.10 ] ) .",
    "we believe this is responsible for the power law tail for large values of @xmath1 , since the combined action of shaking and gravity produces a slowing down of the dynamics , enabling at the same time to obtain denser packings .",
    "however , we are not sure whether this picture corresponds to a real dynamical phase transition in the system , and moreover the identification of an order parameter would be quite problematic . therefore a deeper investigation on this point is needed and we hope to stimulate some future experimental and theoretical works .",
    "now we briefly mention the main changes occurring when a sequential tapping is applied to the system .",
    "although the single tap dynamics can give insight on the dynamical evolution and the relaxation of the system , the sequential tapping procedure can be closely related to experimental situations . in fig .",
    "[ f.11](a ) we compare the density evolution obtained by a single tap of duration @xmath122 with that obtained by a sequential tapping applied for the same amount of time @xmath1 . in particular we have generated @xmath123 taps , each of which was applied for a time @xmath124 .    from the comparison we deduce that the multiple tapping dynamics is slower , suggesting that the fitting form eq .  [ e.stretexp ]",
    "can not describe properly the density evolution in this case .",
    "besides , the saturation density is also lower . in fig .",
    "[ f.11](b ) we characterize more quantitatively the dynamical behavior by plotting the density as a function of the number of taps .",
    "it turns out that in this case the intermediate - long time evolution of the density can be described by the claimed inverse logarithmic law , which was also found in the experiments  @xcite : @xmath125 in this way we can connect directly our model to the experimental data and we can also examine the effect of different dynamical shaking procedures on the compaction process .",
    "in this respect , our results are in agreement with those of nicodemi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who find a similar change of behavior when considering single and multiple tapping .",
    "this should clarify to a certain extent the mechanisms of density relaxation in different dynamical situations .",
    "when a frictional force is introduced , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec.intro ] , some qualitative and quantitative changes are found . in fig .",
    "[ f.12 ] the time evolution of the density for a fixed value of the friction coefficient @xmath38 and several choices of @xmath1 is displayed .    a comparison with fig .",
    "[ f.2 ] shows that for a same value of @xmath1 a much smaller asymptotic density is reached , and that a slowing down of the dynamical behavior occurs . as a consequence , larger values of @xmath1",
    "are needed to obtain the same final densities as for @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ f.13 ] a comparison of @xmath48 between @xmath47 and @xmath126 for @xmath97 is illustrated .",
    "it seems that the same functional form eq .",
    "( [ e.stretexp ] ) adopted for @xmath47 can be used to describe the dynamical evolution of the system . in spite of that , for @xmath127 some slight discrepancies in the tails can be detected for small values of @xmath1 , not visible at the level of detail of the figure .",
    "this means that the reduced probability for horizontal moves affects the compaction mainly in the late stages of the process .",
    "we have also examined the @xmath38 dependence of @xmath48 .",
    "the curve for @xmath47 is far above the others , and furthermore the difference between the curves for low values of @xmath38 is more marked .",
    "such differences show up only after an initial transient in which the various curves are practically superimposed one on the others ( the curves do not start diverging significantly until the density reaches about @xmath128 ) .",
    "this is in compliance with what we have just said about the effectiveness of friction in the asymptotic dynamics .",
    "the behavior of the asymptotic density is depicted in fig .",

    "( [ e.fitrhoinfty ] ) ) and @xmath133 .",
    "thus , saturation density scales in the same way as for @xmath47 , with nearly the same exponent but with a very different relaxation time ( more than one order of magnitude larger ) , i.e. the process is much more sluggish .",

    "[ f.14](b ) we have analyzed the behavior of @xmath54 vs. @xmath38 .",
    "interestingly @xmath54 decreases linearly with @xmath38 for @xmath135 : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "instead the decrease is more drastic for lower values of @xmath38 , as noted above .",

    "it rapidly decreases for @xmath139 , but it is almost constant for larger @xmath38 . in other terms , the independence of @xmath38 of the dynamical evolution reflects itself just in a linear scaling of the final density with @xmath38 .",
    "we hope to elucidate this point more thoroughly in a future work .",
    "we have proposed and discussed a simplified model for dimer compaction , with the intent to take into account relevant dynamical features , such as horizontal shaking and friction forces between particles , analyzing in detail their effects on the density time evolution .",
    "the dynamical behavior of our model is very complex with interesting and novel features . in the absence of friction , for a single tap",
    ", the compaction dynamics can not be interpreted as an inverse logarithmic relaxation but in terms of a stretched exponential law , which is a peculiar characteristic of a continuous range of time constants  @xcite .",
    "thus , the fact that we do not find a logarithmic law but a stretched exponential relaxation could be a peculiar feature related to the single tap dynamics , since nicodemi _",

    "we therefore might infer that different shaking procedures give rise to intrinsically different compaction behaviors , driven by different dynamical mechanisms .",
    "however , it still needs to be clarified whether the logarithmic law is just a good fit to the experimental data or it has a deeper meaning ( see for example the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",

    "more detailed studies of this point are planned for the future in order to reach a better understanding of the physical mechanism underlying this peculiar behavior .",
    "similar to what is found in experiments , horizontal shaking favors locally ordered configurations and leads to higher compaction  @xcite .",
    "we believe it would be important to address further this issue by improving our model , allowing rotations of the dimers during the dynamics .",
