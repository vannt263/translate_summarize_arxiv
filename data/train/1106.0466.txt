    "we consider only the activity of two the promoters @xmath2 and @xmath3 in our model , as reasonable amount of experimental data is available in the literature for these two promoters @xcite .",
    "both these promoters are typical example of tandem promoter , containing a conserved region of @xmath7 base pairs between upstream of @xmath2 and transcriptional start site ( tsp ) of @xmath3 . in the model",

    "although a detailed kinetic mechanism of transcriptional interference has been proposed and verified experimentally @xcite , we use the following notion to keep the model simple @xmath14    where the information of upstream inhibition are put together in the rate constants . the rate constant @xmath15 in eq .",

    "( [ p2ti ] ) . after causing",
    "the interference the rnap coming from @xmath2 falls off from @xmath3 thus giving chance to the later to back to the active form again , which is modeled as the backward reaction with rate constant @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ p2ti ] ) .",
    "this helps the @xmath3 promoter to maintain a low activity even after 2 hours of induction as evident from the experimental data ( see figure 3b of @xcite and figure  [ mrna ] of the present work ) . to keep track of the transcripts generated due to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ,",

    "it is important to mention that exact mechanism for the activation of bvgs in _ b. pertussis _ under temperature induction is not clear from the literature . to incorporate sensing of the external stimulus and subsequent activation of the tcs",

    "in addition they control the expression and/or repression of several downstream genes .          to model regulation of downstream genes under induced condition",
    "we use the following tf binding properties of different promoters of downstream genes .",
    "the promoters for class 1 gene contain low affinity bvga binding site far upstream of the tsp , as a result high level of @xmath10 is necessary to activate these genes and they are expressed quite late compared to class 2 and class 3 genes .",
    "class 2 promoters contain high affinity bvga binding site close to tsp and fairly low level of @xmath10 is sufficient to activate these genes . as a result ,",
    "expression of class 2 genes becomes visible within very short period after induction .",
    "class 3 gene , _ bipa _ , contains high affinity as well as low affinity bvga binding site just upstream and downstream of tsp , respectively . once induced , _ bipa _ becomes active almost at the same time like _ fhab _ ( class 2 gene ) with the help of low amount of @xmath10 . at a critical concentration of bvga gene expression becomes maximum and then it starts falling due to bvga binding to the downstream low affinity binding site .",
    "the _ frlab _ promoter ( class 4 ) has been found to contain distinguishable bvga binding site that overlaps with tsp @xcite .",
    "thus a very low level of bvga may be able to suppress class 4 genes .    in figure  [ cartoon3 ]",
    "we schematically show regulation of four classes of genes as bvga level increases .",
    "the binding kinetics of phosphorylated dimer of bvga ( @xmath10 ) to the promoters of these four classes of genes are given in the supplementary data . while active , four classes of genes starts transcribing their corresponding mrna @xmath39    where @xmath40 .",
    "likewise the transcripts generated from the _ bvg _ locus , we consider natural degradation of the four different classes of transcripts @xmath41    before proceeding further we would like to mention that all the relevant symbols designating biochemical species used in this section are listed in table  1 .",
    "to check the validity of our proposed model , the kinetic network developed in the previous section has been translated into sets of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "to understand functionality of temperature induced switch operative in the proposed model we first analyze the kinetics for _ bvg _ locus and the tcs using quasi - steady state approximation @xcite .",
    "the full network kinetics is then numerically integrated for large set of parameters of the proposed model and compared with _ in vivo _ experimental results @xcite .",

    "thus one can express essential features of the dynamics in terms of the response regulator protein .",
    "to realize the nature of amplification in gene expression at 37 @xmath0c and to analyze the steady state dynamics we divide the tcs signaling network into two modules , the autoregulation module and the phosphorylation ( or post - translational ) module .    before proceeding further",
    "we would like to comment on the input - output relation in the present model .",
    "for this , we define the influx and outflux of phosphate group in the network as @xmath44 \\ ; \\ ; { \\rm and } \\ ; \\ ; j_o = k_{p , a2 } [ s_2 \\cdot a_{2p}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    respectively @xcite . using the steady state expression of",

    "positive feedback enhances the production of @xmath27 which are ready to be phosphorylated at a fixed stimulus .",

    "194 position increases the hydrophobicity of the tf so that inspite of being poorly phosphorylated their interaction with high affinity binding site increases .",
    "the above mentioned results with reverse effects thus immediately raises the question - how these two mutants will behave , if expressed _ in vivo _ ? to answer this",
    "we have predicted the temporal behavior of tf , class  2 mrna and class  3 mrna for r152h and t194 m substitution and compared them with wild type profiles ( see figure  [ mut-1](b)-[mut-1](d ) ) . while simulating the full network ( using eqs .",
    "( 1 - 13 ) ) we have decreased all the binding and unbinding ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) rates of the model , listed in table  2 , by two order of magnitude to get desired phenotypic behavior for the mutants r152h and t194 m .",
    "our _ in silico _ prediction suggests that opposing effect of phosphorylation and binding affinity causes delay in the activation of the signal transduction machinery as reported in @xcite .      to check the sensitivity of the parameter values on the network dynamics listed in table  2 we have adopted the procedure described by @xcite . in this procedure all or a subset of the rate constants were subjected to a random perturbation where the perturbation was drawn from a random gaussian distribution whose mean is the unperturbed value of each rate constant and variance is certain percentage ( up to maximum of 10% ) of the rate constant .",
    "this leads to a set of unperturbed ( reference ) rate constants , @xmath100 ( listed in table  2 ) and an ensemble of perturbed ( modified ) set of rate constants , @xmath101 .",
    "we then calculated the level of @xmath10 at steady state using both the reference set and the modified set using the full network .",

    "whether the parameter set given in table  2 can withstand larger perturbation and gives physically realizable quantity we have perturbed all the parameters up to 20% . using the perturbation method mentioned before we have generated 1000 data set for each level of perturbation and calculated the mean @xmath70 $ ] level to compare with the base value . in figure  ( [ pert ] )",

    "a quasi steady state analysis has been performed which reveals temperature induced sharp molecular switch that responds to the external stimulus , a reminiscent of amplified sensitivity @xcite .",
    "development of the sharp switch has been shown to be the consequence of positive feedback motif present within the _ bvgas _ operon that becomes operative when the temperature of the surrounding is increased ( figure  [ amplify ] ) .",
    "outcome of the sharp switch gets reflected in the accumulation of the tf in large amount within few hours of induction ( figure  [ protein ] ) , which then controls the expression of several downstream genes including the genes for adherence and toxin .",
    "all these features have been observed via numerical integration of the coupled nonlinear odes for large set of parameters .",
    "the resultant numerical results essentially capture the qualitative features of the network dynamics performed _ in vivo_. on the basis of our developed model we then looked into the behavior of two novel mutants impaired in their ability to phosphorylate the transcription factor and made testable predictions for temperature induced class 3 gene expression .    we hope that our _ in silico _ study will inspire more experiments in the coming days to address subtle issues of the network that are yet to be explored .",
