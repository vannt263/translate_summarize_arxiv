    "cosmic rays ( crs ) are relativistic charged particles and most of them are believed to be accelerated at the shock front of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "in fact , tev @xmath0-ray emissions have been detected with h.e.s.s . from the shell of young snrs @xcite . moreover ,",
    "gev @xmath0-ray emissions have been detected with fermi and agile from middle - aged snrs surrounded by molecular clouds .",
    "they are likely to be generated via a hadronic process , i.e. inelastic collisions between cr protons accelerated at snrs and ambient protons @xcite .",
    "tev @xmath0-ray emissions have also been discovered from some of these clouds @xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum of cr protons is not described by a single power - law .",
    "thus , it is most likely to be affected by an escape process from snr shocks ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0-ray observations of molecular clouds around snrs have given us information not only on the cr particle acceleration in the snrs but also on the escape of the particles from the snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , their escape into the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) is important to compare the @xmath0-ray observations of molecular clouds around the snrs with theoretical models of particle acceleration .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite theoretically studied the escape into the ism and obtained an energy spectrum of the escaped particles . in their studies",
    ", they assumed that the diffusion coefficient for the particle diffusion outside the snr is the one in the general region in the galaxy .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the observations seem to show that the diffusion time - scale of crs around snrs is much longer than that in the general region in the galaxy .",
    "they estimated that the diffusion coefficient must be less than @xmath1  % of that in the general region to be consistent with the observations of the snr w  28 and another possible snr in westerlund  2 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "motived by these results , @xcite theoretically studied the diffusion of particles in ism after they left the shock neighbourhood .",
    "they used monte - carlo simulations to follow a particle motion , while at the same time they calculated the evolution of the snr .",
    "they considered the excitation of alfvn waves through the streaming instability caused by crs , and the interactions between the waves and the particles .",
    "since the growth of the waves changes the diffusion coefficient , they took the evolution of the diffusion coefficient into consideration .",
    "they found that the particles actually excite alfvn waves around the snr on a spatial scale of the snr itself if the ism is highly ionised .",
    "thus , even if the particles can leave the shock neighbourhood , scattering by the waves prevents them from moving further away from the snr .",
    "this means that the particles can not virtually escape from the snr until a fairly late stage of the snr evolution",
    ".    however , the model developed by @xcite may still be rather simplified .",
    "in particular , they separately treated the acceleration of particles at the shock front and their propagation into the surrounding ism .",
    "since both of the processes follow the same transport equation , they should be treated seamlessly . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our numerical simulations that deal with both the particle acceleration and the diffusion into the ism at the same time . in these simulations , we take account of the streaming instability developed by the flux of crs in order to study how the growth of the alfvn waves affects the diffusion of the crs .",
    "we emphasise that we focus on the propagation of crs far away from the shock front ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the distance from the snr centre and @xmath4 is the shock radius ) , in contrast with previous studies that treat the escape around the shock front ( @xmath5 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as far as we know , this is the first time to solve a transport equation from the shock vicinity to the region far away from the shock front .",
    "the diffusion of cr particles obeys the transport equation ( diffusion - convection equation ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distribution function of the particles , @xmath8 is the momentum , @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient , is the hydrodynamic velocity of the background gas , and @xmath10 is the source term for the particles , which are injected at the shock front ( @xmath11 ) at a momentum of @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the gas density and the gas velocity relative to the shock just upstream the shock front , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we set @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the sound velocity behind the shock front . the fraction of gas particles that go into the acceleration process at the shock front is @xmath19 .",
    "the equations for the background gas are @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the density , specific heat capacity ratio , and pressure of the gas .",
    "the cr pressure is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the minimum momentum of injected cr particles , @xmath28 is the mass of the particles , and @xmath29 is the velocity of light .",
    "we consider only protons and neglect electrons .",
    "since we treat the propagation of crs away from the shock front , we can not assume a plane geometry .",
    "therefore , we assume spherical symmetry and solve equations ( [ eq : trans])([eq : pg ] ) mainly based on the numerical methods developed by @xcite .",
    "we do not fix the diffusion coefficient @xmath9 at the value corresponding to the bohm diffusion , which is different from the studies by @xcite .",
    "instead , we follow the evolution of @xmath9 in this study , considering the amplification of alfvn waves by cr particles . since the waves scatter the particles , they affect the diffusion coefficient in equation ( [ eq : trans ] ) .",
    "the growth of the waves is given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : psi }   \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t }   \\approx \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\frac{v_{\\rm a } p^4 v}{u_{\\rm m } }    the energy density of alfvn waves per unit logarithmic bandwidth ( which are resonant with particles of momentum @xmath8 ) relative to the ambient magnetic energy density @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the alfvn velocity @xcite .",
    "we do not consider the damping of the waves for simplicity .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the velocity of the particle , @xmath35 is the elementary charge , @xmath36 is the unperturbed magnetic field , and @xmath37 is the density of unperturbed ism .",
    "following @xcite , we included the influence of gas compression on the magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) and particle scattering by assuming that @xmath9 depends on the gas density .",
    "the diffusion coefficient corresponding to the bohm diffusion is given by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the gyroradius of particles .",
    "we calculate the evolution of the gas and cr particles using the methods of @xcite for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the shock velocity .",
    "we call this region the `` shock region '' . since we are also interested in the cr diffusion outside this region , we added equal interval meshes for @xmath44 .",
    "we call this surrounding region the `` escape region '' . for this region ,",
    "we calculate the diffusion of the cr particles only with @xmath45 . for this energy range ,",
    "the escape region is sufficiently apart from the shock front , and the feedback of the cr particles on hydrodynamics is small there .",
    "thus , we ignore the feedback in this region ( @xmath46 ) and solve equation  ( [ eq : trans ] ) without considering the change of @xmath47 in the direction @xmath8 ( the third term in the right hand of equation  [ [ eq : trans ] ] ) , which makes calculations much easier . the term @xmath48 in equation  ( [ eq : trans ] )",
    "can also be ignored in this region , although we do not omit the term in the calculations . on the other hand",
    ", we do not solve the diffusion of particles with @xmath49 in the escape region , because @xmath50 can not be ignored even in the region .",
    "since the feedback of the low - energy particles on hydrodynamics is limited in the vicinity of the shock , they do not affect the following results at @xmath2 .",
    "we set @xmath51 at @xmath52 .",
    "the initial condition of @xmath53 is given as follows .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the background ism is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the particle energy @xcite .",
    "we relate @xmath56 to the energy density of alfvn waves ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 if we set @xmath59 at @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the time when we start injecting crs , @xmath53 does not grow enough and particles are not accelerated .",
    "as has been well known , for diffusive shock acceleration to work , @xmath53 must be as large as that for bohm diffusion near the shock front ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in this study , we simply assume that the diffusion at the shock front can be represented by bohm diffusion ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "one can find that the energy density of alfvn waves corresponding to @xmath63 is @xmath64 . on the other hand , for @xmath65",
    ", the coefficient should be the one at the interstellar space ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "as the initial condition of @xmath53 at @xmath60 , we interpolate the two @xmath53s : @xmath67\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\psi_{\\rm ism } \\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is a parameter . although the value of @xmath68 can not be specified , it would not be much larger than one .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath69 in the following simulations .",
    "the larger @xmath68 gives the smaller diffusion coefficient at a given @xmath3 and results in less escape of the particles .",
    "for values of @xmath68 as small as one , it is increasingly difficult to obtain stable and precise results , because @xmath47 changes rapidly at the boundary between the shock and escape region , where resolution is not high enough .",
    "we consider three models : ( a ) the growth of @xmath53 is considered , ( b ) the diffusion coefficient is fixed at @xmath70 regardless of time and position , and ( c ) the wave energy density does not change and is fixed at @xmath71 , replacing @xmath61 with @xmath72 in equation  ( [ eq : psi_i ] ) .",
    "the models b and c are calculated for comparison . in model",
    "a , we set a lower limit of @xmath53 as @xmath73 , replacing @xmath61 with @xmath72 in equation  ( [ eq : psi_i ] ) . moreover , we set a upper limit of @xmath53 as @xmath74 .    since we do not consider the neutral damping of the waves , we choose the ism with a relatively high temperature . the density and sound velocity of the background ism is @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "a supernova explodes at @xmath77 and @xmath78 with an energy of @xmath79  erg .",
    "the background magnetic field is @xmath80 .",
    "we inject cr particles and calculate the growth of alfvn waves ( equation  [ [ eq : psi ] ] ) for @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the time when the free expansion phase of the snr ends and the sedov phase begins . for the parameters we adopted , @xmath83  yr .",
    "in figure  [ fig : bf]a , we show the profiles of @xmath53 at @xmath84 for models  a and c. at this time , the radius of the snr is @xmath85  pc , and the compression ratio of the gas is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the gas density behind the shock , for models  a , b , and  c. the left ends of the curves correspond to @xmath88 , and the right ends correspond to @xmath57 .",
    "the difference between model  a and  c indicates that cr particles can significantly amplify alfvn waves .",
    "in particular , the amplification occurs even in the region far away from the shock front ( say , at @xmath89 ) for particles with @xmath90  tev .",
    "the profiles are given by the balance between the growth through streaming instability and the flow of low-@xmath53 gas from upstream on the shock coordinate .",
    "the amplification of the waves prohibits the diffusion of particles . in figure",
    "[ fig : bf]b , we show the profiles of @xmath47 at @xmath91 .",
    "while the particles are confined around the shock front in model  b , they can extend to the region where @xmath92 in model  c ( figure  [ fig : bf ] ) .",
    "the results when the growth of @xmath53 is considered ( model  a ) are located between those two models , although the profiles of @xmath53 and @xmath47 are somewhat different between @xmath93 and 20  tev ( figure  [ fig : bf ] ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : evo ] shows the evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath47 for model  a for @xmath95 , normalised by @xmath96 in the radial direction .",
    "the radius of the snr at @xmath97 is @xmath98  pc . for @xmath93  tev",
    ", @xmath53 increases in the `` instep '' or the region where the gradient of @xmath53 is small ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is because of the leak of particles into the low-@xmath53 region ( @xmath100 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath90  tev",
    ", @xmath53 increases in the `` shin '' or the region where the gradient of @xmath53 is large ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "the leak of particles into the low-@xmath53 region ( @xmath92 ) is less significant for @xmath90  tev than for @xmath93  tev ( figure  [ fig : evo]b ) .",
    "this is because @xmath102 at @xmath93  tev is smaller than that at @xmath90  tev ( figure  [ fig : evo]a and equations  [ eq : kappa_ism ] and  [ eq : psi_ism ] ) . for smaller @xmath57 , particles tend to go father away from the shock front , if the distance is represented in the units of @xmath103 .",
