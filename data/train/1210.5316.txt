    "the spin hall effect@xcite is the generation of the spin accumulation , or the difference in density between spin - up and spin - down electrons , due to the spin current driven by the perpendicular electric field .",
    "this transverse effect is produced by spin - orbit interaction in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "it has attracted much attention in the field of spintronics@xcite as a promising way to create the spin accumulation in nonmagnetic materials .",
    "the first report on the observation of the spin hall effect has been made by kato et al.@xcite for three - dimensional electron systems ( 3des ) in semiconductors , n - doped gaas and n - doped ingaas , and is followed by many experimental works including the observation in two - dimensional hole systems ( 2dhs)@xcite and that in two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des).@xcite theoretical proposals have been made before such observations and are classified into the intrinsic origin and the extrinsic one .",
    "the intrinsic spin hall effect@xcite is due to the spin - orbit interaction induced by the crystal potential as well as the confining potential of a quantum well . the extrinsic spin hall effect@xcite originates from electron scatterings from nonmagnetic impurities in the presence of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the spin hall effect observed in the 3des@xcite and that in the 2des@xcite have been explained by calculations based on the extrinsic mechanism.@xcite in this paper we investigate the extrinsic spin nernst effect in 2des .",
    "the observation of the spin hall effect in 2des has been made by sih et al.@xcite in a ( 110 ) algaas quantum well .",
    "they have already suggested in their paper that the observed spin hall effect is extrinsic , since ( 1 ) the quantum well is doped at the area density of @xmath0@xmath1 , ( 2 ) the measured value of the rashba coefficient is small , and ( 3 ) the dresselhaus field should be absent because of the current orientation along the [ 001 ] axis in the ( 110 ) quantum well . since the measurement in 2des,@xcite as the 3des experiment,@xcite",
    "is made at the temperature of 30k , the phase coherence in the electron transport may not be important .",
    "therefore a theoretical study for this experiment has been performed based on the boltzmann equation by hankiewicz and vignale,@xcite as well as the semiclassical theory by engel et al.@xcite for the 3des experiment .    in the atomic - layer epitaxial growth of a semiconductor heterostructure ,",
    "both positively and negatively ionized impurities can be introduced at a precise distance from the heterointerface by employing the method of delta - doping.@xcite in fact , both si ( donor ) and be ( acceptor ) have been doped successfully at a precise distance from the interface of a gaas / algaas heterostructure , and a strong dependence on the dopant type has been found in magnetotransport properties of a 2des located near the dopant.@xcite such an accurate control of the doping profile gives the 2des an advantage in that this can provide a method to enhance strongly the spin accumulation due to the extrinsic spin hall effect .",
    "a remarkable dependence of the extrinsic spin hall current on the impurity - limited mobility has been found in a model of 2des by hankiewicz and others.@xcite the 2des in their model has a negligible width and therefore the dependence on the above - mentioned doping profile is beyond the scope of their works .",
    "there are two contributions to the extrinsic spin hall current .",
    "one is the contribution from the skew scattering@xcite and the other is that from the side jump.@xcite both have long been studied in the theory of the anomalous hall effect in ferromagnetic metals ( see refs . for early theories on the anomalous hall effect and ref . for a recent review ) .",
    "the skew - scattering contribution has a different sign depending on whether the impurity potential is attractive or repulsive , while the side - jump contribution is independent of both the impurity potential and the impurity density . for attractive impurity potentials ,",
    "the contributions from the skew scattering and the side jump are opposite in sign .",
    "therefore the direction of the spin current is switched as the weight of the skew - scattering contribution is changed , for example by varying the mobility.@xcite this theoretical finding suggests that the spin accumulation due to the extrinsic spin hall effect can be controlled in a wide range , for example , by changing the impurity density .",
    "we expect that the controllability should be enhanced by introducing various doping profiles with the delta - doping technique .",
    "the temperature gradient is another driving force for the spin current in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this phenomenon , called the spin nernst effect , is one of the most important subjects in ` spin caloritronics ' , a research field exploring the interplay between the heat and the spin degree of freedom,@xcite the spin nernst effect is the nonmagnetic analogue of the anomalous nernst effect . while the anomalous nernst effect has been studied in 3d ferromagnetic metals for nearly a century ( see refs . for early experiments , refs . for early theories )",
    ", studies on the spin nernst effect have started quite recently .",
    "an experimental study to observe the spin nernst effect is in progress in 3d metals.@xcite several theoretical studies on the spin nernst effect have been made in 2des.@xcite however , these theories are only for the intrinsic origin due to the rashba term .",
    "the spin nernst effect with the extrinsic origin is worth studying theoretically , in particular , the dependence on the type and the density of impurities .",
    "even the sign of each contribution in the extrinsic mechanism is not known in the spin nernst effect .    in this paper",
    "we study theoretically the spin nernst effect in 2des based on the extrinsic mechanism by employing the boltzmann equation . in particular",

    "in this model of 2des we have investigated the dependence of the spin nernst coefficient on the sign of the impurity potential and on the impurity density , and compared the result with that of the spin hall coefficient .",
    "we have found that the spin nernst coefficient changes its sign as a function of the impurity density in the case of the repulsive impurity potential , while no sign change occurs for the attractive impurity potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin hall coefficient changes its sign in the case of the attractive impurity potential , as shown already by hankiewicz and vignale.@xcite the sign change of each coefficient occurs due to the cancellation between the skew - scattering contribution and the side - jump contribution .",
