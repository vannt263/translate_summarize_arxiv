    "<S> low temperature specific heat of the electron - doped ( n - type ) infinite - layer cuprate @xmath0 has been measured . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle density of states ( dos ) in the mixed state is found to be consistent with the feature of the s - wave pairing symmetry , agreeing very well with the earlier tunnelling measurement , but being contrary to the d - wave symmetry well confirmed for the hole - doped ( p - type ) cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the electronic dos are mainly contributed by the vortex cores in the present sample being contrast to the p - type cuprates in which the vortex cores are abnormal and contribute very limited low energy dos as evidenced by many means .    </S>",
    "<S> the pairing symmetry is one of the essential points in clarifying the underling physics of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) , since it is supposed to be related to the pairing mechanism in these materials . in the hole </S>",
    "<S> doped side , the pairing symmetry of the cuprate is widely believed to be @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this has been supported by tremendous experiments@xcite both from surface detection@xcite and bulk measurements@xcite . for the electron doped systems , </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry of the order parameter remains highly controversial . </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite and phase - sensitive scanning squid measurements@xcite indicate a d - wave symmetry in @xmath2 ( ncco ) and @xmath3 ( pcco ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , raman scattering shows a nonmonotonic d - wave order parameter@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specific heat measurement on @xmath4 reveal also lines of nodes on the gap function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this has been contrasted by tunnelling@xcite and penetration depth measurement@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been recently argued that there may be a crossover from d - wave to s - wave symmetries by changing the doped electron concentration@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently chen et al.@xcite reported evidence of strongly correlated s - wave pairing in the infinite - layer superconductor @xmath0 by tunnelling spectroscope . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion can also be corroborated indirectly by the stronger suppression of @xmath5 by magnetic quantum impurities @xmath6 than non - magnetic ones @xmath7@xcite , which is the same as observed in conventional s - wave superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> since tunnelling technique relies on the surface situation , a bulk evidence is thus strongly desirable for the pairing symmetry in this material . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the specific heat is one of the important means to explore the low energy excitations which reflect the bulk properties@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present magnetic field dependent specific heat of @xmath0 in low temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field induced quasiparticle dos have been found to be well consistent with a s - wave pairing symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we further conclude that the vortex cores contribute the dominant part of dos in this n - type cuprate . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to the observations in p - type cuprates .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample studied in this work is high - density granular material of @xmath0@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) patterns show no any trace of a second phase in the sample . the ac susceptibility measured with @xmath8 and @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> is shown in the inset of fig.1 , and one can see that the sample has a sharp transition at a temperature of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a piece about 23.13 mg in mass , @xmath11 in dimensions , was chosen for the specific heat ( sh ) measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity data presented here were taken with the relaxation method based on an oxford cryogenic system maglab . </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity is determined by a direct measurement of the thermal time constant , @xmath12 , here @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the heat capacity of the sample and addenda ( including a small sapphire substrate , small printed film heater , tiny cernox temperature sensor , @xmath1525 @xmath16 gold wire leads , wakefield thermal conducting grease ( @xmath17 ) ) respectively , where @xmath18 is the thermal conductance between the chip and a thermal link . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath14 has been measured and subtracted from the total heat capacity , thus @xmath13 value reported here is only the heat capacity of the sample . we have also checked the field dependence of @xmath14 and found that the change ( if any ) of @xmath14 under 12 t is in the same order of the noise background ( 20 nj / k at 5 k and 40 nj / k at 20 k ) . the influence of the magnetic field ( 12 t ) on the readout of the thermometer is below 0.02 k and can be neglected . during the measurement , the sample </S>",
    "<S> was cooled to the lowest temperature under a magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) ( field - cooling ) followed by data acquisition in the warming up process .     at magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 12 t for the sample @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows the ac susceptibility of the sample.,width=302 ]    fig.1 shows the sh coefficient @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 at magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 12 t. the separation between each field can be well determined . in low temperature region </S>",
    "<S> the curves are upturned below 4 t , and gradually a slight but broad hump appears for higher magnetic fields , these are due to the schottky anomaly of free spins which will be discussed later . beside the schottky anomaly , the curve at zero field extrapolates to a finite value @xmath22 at 0 k , which is about 3 to 5 times smaller than that observed in p - type cuprate superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> if the sample has the d - wave symmetry , this can be interpreted as potential scattering near the node of @xmath1 gap function due to small amount impurities@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the sample has a typical s - wave symmetry , this term should be very weak if the scatterers are non - magnetic . </S>",
    "<S> the small but finite value of @xmath23 observed here may be still explained as due to impurity scattering with strong correlation effect in the present sample although it is s - wave@xcite . in addition , for the temperature above 8 k , the sh deviates from a @xmath24 law due to higher order terms in the phonon sh . to avoid extra parameters needed to describe the phonon sh above 8k , </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is restricted to t@xmath257k .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that different gap symmetries give rise to different quasiparticle dos @xmath26 near the fermi level@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> conventional low-@xmath5 superconductors show an s - wave gap symmetry in which the electronic sh has an exponential temperature dependence , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> for present sample , @xmath28 is about 13 mev@xcite , thus @xmath29 can be negligible at temperatures considered here ( @xmath30 ) . for a clean d - wave superconductor with nodes , since @xmath31 near the fermi level , this leads to the relation @xmath32@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we fit the zero field sh data with eq.(1 ) and eq.(2 ) according to d - wave and s - wave ( when @xmath33 ) respectively , @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the zero field schottky anomaly due to the effective internal field , @xmath37 is the phonon term , @xmath38 is the zero field linear term as discussed above , and the @xmath39 term is due to the excitations with lines of nodes in d - wave case . </S>",
    "<S> the fit results of the zero field data to eq.(1 ) , with the phonon coefficient @xmath40 to be free and to be fixed as the average of the fit results of the high fields , @xmath41 , are shown in table i.    table i. zero - field specific heat fit to eq.(1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> ( units are mj , mol , and k. )    c cc cc cc cc & & & & + @xmath42 & @xmath43 & & & & + @xmath42 & & & & +    from table i , one can see that the zero field data can not produce reasonable @xmath44 both with free @xmath40 and with the fixed @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the zero field dos of the sample does not have the term @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> so we use eq.(2 ) , the case of s - wave when @xmath33 , to fit the zero field data and deduce the reasonable value of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the @xmath45 may indicate preliminarily that the pairing symmetry of present sample is not clean d - wave like .    </S>",
    "<S> then we take a general fit to the sh data at different fields . </S>",
    "<S> no matter the sample has a s - wave or d - wave symmetry , at a fixed magnetic field , in low temperature region the fit formulae can be written as@xcite ,    @xmath46    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the schottky anomaly under a magnetic field ; n is related to the concentration of spin-1/2 particles ; and @xmath49 is the sum of the zero field linear term and the magnetic field induced linear contribution , @xmath50=@xmath51 @xmath52 for s - wave and @xmath53 for d - wave . </S>",

    "<S> the upper - left inset shows a typical example for the result of the schottky term ( 12 t ) @xmath74 , and the solid line represents a fit to eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    the fit results of the phonon term @xmath40 and the schottky term at 12 t are shown as insets of fig.2 , where @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the large value @xmath75 in low field region may be induced by the residual effect of the internal crystal field . in order to remove the influence of the schottky anomaly </S>",
    "<S> , we subtract the raw data with @xmath76 and the results are shown in the main panel of fig.2 .    in the mixed state , there are two types of quasiparticle excitations in the bulk of a superconductor : bound states inside the vortex cores , and extended states outside the vortex cores ( as predicted for d - wave @xcite ) . in conventional s - wave superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> the inner core bound states dominate the quasiparticle excitations ; therefore , the electronic sh is proportional to the number of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> the number of vortices increases linearly with field , thus the magnetic field induced electronic sh is proportional to h@xcite , i.e. , @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> if we divide each side by @xmath24 , one obtains    @xmath78    for a gap with lines of nodes ( e.g. , d - wave symmetry ) , the extended quasiparticles dominate the excitation spectrum in the clean limit . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the electronic sh has a @xmath79 dependence in the clean limit at @xmath80@xcite and the data should obey simon - lee@xcite scaling law    @xmath81    since the phonon sh is field independent and the schottky contribution has been removed from the raw data , we can obtain the field dependent part of the electronic sh through subtracting the zero field sh from the one measured at other fields . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for the s - wave symmetry , @xmath82/t^3 \\propto h / t^2 $ ] , thus should scale with @xmath83 ; for the d - wave symmetry , @xmath84/t^{2 } = c_{vol}/t^2-\\alpha$ ] , should also scale with @xmath83 .    /t^{3}$ </S>",

    "<S> no good scaling can be found for the d - wave case.,width=302 ]    the scaling result of the magnetic field induced dos with the s - wave condition ( eq.(5 ) ) is presented in fig.3a . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling quality is quite good . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is a theoretical curve @xmath86 , thus @xmath87 according to eq.(5 ) . taking @xmath88=50 t , @xmath89 , which is quite close to the value of optimally doped @xmath90@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3b shows the scaling by following the d - wave condition ( eq.(6 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the result of the scaling for the s - wave condition is much better than the clean d - wave condition . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is tempting to conclude that the pairing symmetry of the sample is not the clean d - wave but very likely s - wave . </S>",
    "<S> the field induced quasiparticle dos are contributed mainly by the vortex cores .    </S>",

    "<S> the obtained @xmath93 is 0.85 , being close to the linear condition b=1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that all sh measurements on p - type cuprates ( mostly near optimal doped point ) yield a value @xmath94 giving the evidence for d - wave . </S>",
    "<S> distinction from the d - wave symmetry is apparent in present sample although @xmath95 instead of 1 is found here . </S>",
    "<S> actually the curve between 1 t and 10 t is close to be linear . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that@xcite when the field is relatively high , the vortex lattice effect should be considered and usually the linear h dependence of the quasiparticle dos can not be seen for s - wave . in fig.4 the dotted line is a fit to the clean d - wave superconductor with @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the clean limit d - wave can not describe the data at all . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used the dirty - limit relation to fit the zero temperature dos . at the unitary limit and t = 0 , </S>",
    "<S> k@xmath97bert and hirschfeld@xcite predicted that the field induced dos for d - wave is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , @xmath100 the gap maximum , @xmath101 the impurity scattering rate , and @xmath102 , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> worthy of noting is that this relation is too flexible which can apparently fit to data with strong diversity . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to our data yields @xmath104=3604 . </S>",
    "<S> taking a=1 , one has @xmath105 which is far beyond the reasonable value . </S>",
    "<S> so the d - wave in the dirty limit can not be used to interpret our data either . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast with what appears for the p - type cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> recently sh measurements on an overdoped lsco single crystal ( x=0.22 ) revealed also a d - wave pairing symmetry and very limited contribution from the vortex cores to the electronic dos in the mixed state@xcite . </S>",
