    "in a recent paper strange@xcite discussed some quantum - mechanical properties of an electron in a constant magnetic field . since the system is axially symmetric along the field direction ( chosen to be the @xmath1 axis ) then the projection of the angular momentum along that axis is a constant of the motion .",
    "the motion of the electron is free along the @xmath1 axis and bounded on the plane @xmath4 .",
    "restricting the motion of the electron to this plane strange discussed the uncertainty relation for the azimuthal angle @xmath5 and the @xmath1component of the angular momentum @xmath6 that he assumed to be @xmath7 .",
    "however , he did not take into account some of the subtleties of this uncertainty relation that make it quite different from that for a cartesian coordinate and its conjugate linear momentum .",
    "the @xmath8 uncertainty relation was discussed by several authors in the past@xcite .",
    "there is even an interesting series of pedagogical articles on the subject@xcite , not without some controversy@xcite . according to those papers",
    "the uncertainty relation invoked by strange is incorrect .",
    "for this reason we deem it worthwhile to carry out a more detailed analysis of the results derived by this author , particularly because the @xmath9 uncertainty relation is suitable for an undergraduate course on quantum mechanics@xcite .    in section [ sec : uncertainty ]",
    "we derive the uncertainty relation for an arbitrary pair of observables following chisolm@xcite . in section [",
    "sec : example ] we first outline strange s results based on the incorrect @xmath8 uncertainty relation and then derive an exact one following kraus@xcite and chisolm@xcite",
    ". we also contrast the exact uncertainty relation with the incorrect one by means of a state that is somewhat more general than the one chosen by strange .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the main results of this paper and draw conclusions .",
    "in order to make this paper sufficiently self - contained and facilitate the discussion of the uncertainty relation for the electron in a constant magnetic field@xcite in what follows we derive the uncertainty relation for an arbitrary pair of observables .",
    "there are different ways of deriving it@xcite and in what follows we resort to the well known schwarz inequality@xcite . to this end",
    "consider the usual complex inner product in quantum mechanics in terms of the bra - ket notation : @xmath10 .",
    "the schwarz inequality states that @xmath11 for any two vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the state vector space .",
    "chisolm@xcite derived a somewhat more general uncertainty relation from the obvious expression @xmath14 however , for present purposes it is sufficient to take into account that @xmath15 ( that is to say @xmath16 ) that leads to @xmath17    let @xmath18 be the state of the system normalized to unity ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 and @xmath21 the hermitean operators for two quantum - mechanical observables .",
    "we define @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , so that @xmath25 since @xmath26 then it follows from equation  ( [ eq : schwarz2 ] ) that @xmath27 if @xmath28 belongs to the domain of @xmath29 and @xmath30 to the domain of @xmath21 then we can write @xmath31 and thus obtain the standard uncertainty relation @xmath32 \\right\\rangle \\right|   \\label{eq : uncertainty}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 = \\hat{a}\\hat{b}-\\hat{b}\\hat{a}$ ] is the well known commutator . the interested reader will find a more detailed discussion of the domains and ranges of operators in the literature already cited@xcite .    before applying the results of this section to a particular model in the next one",
    "it is worth stressing the fact that equation ( [ eq : uncertainty ] ) is valid provided that the root - mean - square deviations @xmath34 and @xmath35 are calculated according to equation  ( [ eq : deltaa_deltab ] ) and that equations ( [ eq : turn_over ] ) hold for the chosen state @xmath36 . if the chosen state and operators do not satisfy the latter conditions we can still use the more general inequality ( [ eq : uncertaiinty_gen ] ) .",
    "strange@xcite described the motion of the electron in the @xmath4 plane in polar coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for simplicity we omit the variable @xmath41 that is not relevant to the discussion of the uncertainty relation for @xmath42 and @xmath43 that commutes with the hamiltonian operator of the system . in the coordinate representation",
    "we define these operators as follows : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "although it has been argued that this definition of the quantum - mechanical operator for the azimuthal angle may not be correct@xcite we keep it here because it is relevant to the discussion of the results obtained by strange@xcite .",
    "besides , chisolm@xcite already chose this definition of @xmath42 in his discussion of the uncertainty relations .",
    "we assume the state vectors to be periodic functions of period @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and choose the standard inner product @xmath48    strange@xcite stated that `` the azimuthal angle - angular momentum uncertainty relation is @xmath49 '' .",
    "the origin of this uncertainty relation is unclear as it differs from the standard one @xmath50 for the coordinate @xmath51 and its conjugate momentum @xmath52 . in order to verify this uncertainty relation he later chose `` an equally weighted sum of the @xmath53 and @xmath54 state '' .",
    "since he did not write the state explicitly we suppose that it was of the form @xmath55 from which we obtain @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in agreement with his results .",
    "arguing that `` the uncertainty in angle arises directly from the fact that the origin of the angular coordinate is arbitrary '' he chose @xmath59 and obtained @xmath60 .",
    "however , in section [ sec : uncertainty ] we showed that the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : uncertainty ] ) is valid if the root - mean - square deviations are calculated as in equation ( [ eq : deltaa_deltab ] ) . in the present case the inequality holds for @xmath61 and , therefore , also for @xmath62 .",
    "the results just discussed are valid for the particular state ( [ eq : psi_strange ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to derive the @xmath8 uncertainty relation for an arbitrary wave function @xmath63 of period @xmath46 .",
    "if we integrate @xmath64 by parts we obtain@xcite @xmath65 and equation ( [ eq : uncertaiinty_gen ] ) leads to the exact inequality @xmath66 already derive earlier by other authors@xcite .",
    "the reason why @xmath67 is that @xmath68 , unlike @xmath63 , is not a periodic function of period @xmath69 and , consequently , does not belong to the domain of @xmath43 ( a more detailed discussion of this issue is available in the articles already cited@xcite ) .",
    "however , note that when @xmath70 the right - hand - side of equation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz ] ) is exactly @xmath71 because @xmath72 . in other words ,",
    "the ` standard ' uncertainty relation @xmath73 is valid for the particular wave function @xmath74 chosen by strange as an illustrative example .    since the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz ] ) may be smaller that @xmath71 the standard uncertainty relation @xmath75 is not guaranteed .",
    "we think that it is a worthy pedagogical experiment to test its validity on other state functions .",
    "for example , we can try a more general linear combination of the same two states with @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , which reduces to @xmath74 when @xmath78 . with this simple function",
    "we easily obtain @xmath79 note that @xmath80 when @xmath81 or @xmath82 because @xmath83 and @xmath84 are eigenfunctions of @xmath43 , and that in both cases @xmath85 .",
    "besides , it follows from @xmath86 that @xmath87 for all @xmath77 .",
    "[ fig : dphidlz ] shows that @xmath88 at four points : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the standard uncertainty relation @xmath73 holds only for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , while , on the other hand , the exact one @xmath95 is valid for all @xmath96 .",
    "in addition to it , @xmath97 only for @xmath98 , that is to say , for an equally weighted sum of the states with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : dphi ] shows that @xmath99 for all @xmath77 so that if the uncertainty relation holds for the root - mean - square deviation @xmath100 then it also holds for @xmath59 as argued above .",
    "[ fig : pidlz ] shows that @xmath101 at four points @xmath102 and @xmath103 and that @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this uncertainty relation fails for @xmath96 outside those intervals .",
    "we appreciate that the inequality invoked by strange@xcite ( which he arbitrarily chose to be @xmath107 ) is not valid for all possible states of the system .",
    "for simplicity we have restricted the discussion of the uncertainty relation to states that depend only on the azimuthal angle . by no means",
    "does such restriction invalidate the conclusions drawn from the state ( [ eq : psi(a , phi ) ] ) that are illustrated in figures [ fig : dphidlz ] , [ fig : dphi ] and [ fig : pidlz ] .",
    "however , as a further pedagogical exercise it is worth taking into account the actual motion of the electron on the @xmath108 plane .",
    "if we repeat the calculation for states @xmath109 and the inner product @xmath110 we obtain the exact uncertainty relation @xmath111 where @xmath112 equation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz_r_phi ] ) is a generalization of the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz ] ) that was derived earlier by kraus@xcite .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz_r_phi ] ) is suitable for the @xmath113-dependent states chosen by strange@xcite to illustrate the probability backflow .",
    "for example , using strange s three - term wavefunction ( his equation ( 11 ) properly normalized)@xcite we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 that satisfy the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz_r_phi ] ) .",
    "exactly in the same way we can easily generalize the uncertainty relations derived by chisolm@xcite that provide tighter lower bounds to the products of square - root - mean deviations .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the uncertainty relation invoked by strange@xcite in his discussion of the probability backflow is only valid for a particular set of wave functions .",
    "the electron in a constant magnetic field is a suitable example for showing that the @xmath8 uncertainty relation should be applied carefully because it is different from the @xmath116 one . in order to keep the discussion as simple as possible",
    "we have avoided more complicated issues like the correct form of the operator for the azimuthal angle and of its square - root - mean deviation@xcite .",
    "instead , we have kept the most straightforward definitions of both the operator @xmath42 and its square - root - mean deviation @xmath100@xcite that proved suitable for the analysis of the results obtained by strange@xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that in the case of the motion of a particle in three dimensions one can easily derive uncertainty relations similar to equation ( [ eq : delta_phi_delta_lz_r_phi ] ) that generalize those derived earlier by other authors@xcite ."
