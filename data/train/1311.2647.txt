    "on july 4 , 2012 , after years , decades , and even generations of immense efforts by thousands of scientists , the world learned of the discovery of a new kind of particle : what is almost certainly a higgs boson . since the measured properties of this particle are now in excellent agreement with the required properties , in the remainder of this article we will drop the qualifier  almost \" and adopt the working assumption that this particle _ is _ in fact a higgs boson .",
    "let us then proceed to describe why it deserves the world - wide exaltation with which it has been greeted , beginning with fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] , which already provides some sense of the centrality of this particle .     and @xmath0 particles , with the photon @xmath1 and gluons @xmath2 remaining massless .",
    "( the photon , the gluons , and the @xmath3 and @xmath0 are respectively the carriers of the electromagnetic , strong nuclear , and weak nuclear forces . ) the fermions all have spin 1/2 , the vector bosons all have spin 1 , and the concept of spin is explained in the text .",

    "[ fig1-fn0266h],width=480 ]    the higgs boson is an excitation of the higgs field , which permeates all of space .",
    "( as used here , the term `` higgs field '' means only a single field in the context of the standard model , but includes at least a pair of such fields in the context of a supersymmetric extension .",
    "one field is required to give masses to the top row of quarks in fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] , and another for the bottom row . ) as this field cooled with the rest of the universe , following the origin of the universe in an extremely hot big bang , it underwent a condensation , analogous to the condensation of water vapor into a liquid when it is cooled .",
    "but the higgs condensate fills all of space , and you are always living and moving in this extremely dense fluid .",
    "you never notice it because it is essentially a superfluid with zero viscosity .",
    "to create an excitation of the higgs condensate  otherwise known as a higgs boson  requires smashing particles together at energies that could only be attained at the world s most powerful accelerator laboratories  the tevatron near chicago and the large hadron collider ( or lhc ) near geneva .",
    "an aerial photo representing the lhc is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2-8701973.eps ] .    .",
    "credit : cern [ fig2-8701973.eps],width=480 ]    these ideas have a rich history , which is briefly summarized elsewhere  @xcite and which centers on the _ englert - brout - higgs mechanism",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism explains how the @xmath3 and @xmath0 particles of fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] acquire their masses , and it played a leading role in the development of the standard model of particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the masses of the @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath0 are critically important because they account for the short range of the weak nuclear force , which causes radioactive beta decay and helps to power the sun and other stars . according to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics",
    ", a force - carrying virtual particle can `` borrow '' an energy @xmath6 for a time @xmath7 , where ( in a simple picture ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 is planck s constant divided by @xmath10 .",
    "a particle with a large mass @xmath11 has to borrow a large energy @xmath12 , so it can only travel for a short time , and consequently a short distance .",
    "if there were no higgs condensate to provide masses to the @xmath3 and @xmath0 particles , the weak force would be long range , and we would not have the familiar slow nuclear burning of hydrogen in the sun and other stars .",
    "one interesting aspect of the higgs discovery is that it demonstrates the unity of physics .",
    "phenomena in high energy physics , at enormous energies or temperatures , can be qualitatively the same as phenomena in condensed matter physics and atomic physics at quite low energies or temperatures .",
    "examples in the present context are @xmath13he , which begins to become a superfluid when cooled to 2.17 k , and various systems of trapped atoms , which have been cooled to less than @xmath14 k. superfluid @xmath13he has exactly zero viscosity , so that an object moving through it effectively does not notice that it is there , until the object exceeds a critical velocity where it begins to produce excitations . in this sense , moving through @xmath13he near 0 k would be like moving through the normally undetectable higgs condensate .",
    "an even more exciting aspect of this recent discovery is that it appears to be a harbinger of further revolutionary breakthroughs , as discussed below .",
    "the higgs is a bridge particle in a number of different respects . as implied by fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] , it bridges the matter particles on the left and force particles on the right , providing masses to both kinds of particles , but in different ways .",
    "it also promises to be a bridge between the entire standard model ( sm ) of fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] and new phenomena and concepts at higher energy : the mere existence of a scalar boson  a particle with no spin  requires new physics if its mass is to be protected from enormous quantum corrections , as explained below .",
    "a particle s spin angular momentum @xmath15 is analogous to the angular momentum of an ordinary spinning object , such as a bicycle wheel .",
    "but it is always the same for a given kind of particle , and it is quantized according to @xmath16 , where the spin quantum number @xmath17 is a multiple of @xmath18 ",
    "i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "all the matter and force particles of fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] behave in essentially the same way as the electron and photon ( particle of light ) which are familiar in ordinary life .",
    "in fact they are so familar that , as you look around , all that you are observing is essentially just electrons and photons , with the atomic nuclei behaving as point charges for most purposes .",
    "the theory of electrons and photons was fully developed by the 1950s , and their behavior is well understood . in particular , it was found that quantum corrections lead to extremely weak ( logarithmic ) infinities that can be successfully controlled , in the sense that they do not appear in the results for physical quantities .    as a consequence ,",
    "the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements agree with an accuracy that is equivalent to measuring the distance between new york city and los angeles to within less than the thickness of a human hair .",
    "calculations for the other matter and force particles at high energy use similar methods ( which have been extended in various ways ) and the infinities are still under control .",
    "these particles respectively have spin 1/2 and 1 .",
    "but for the latest particle to enter the community of fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ]  the higgs boson with spin 0  the calculations lead to an extremely strong infinity for the correction to its mass @xmath23 . if one imposes a cutoff energy @xmath24 in the calculation , then @xmath25 in proportion to @xmath24 , and some new physics is expected to intervene and cancel this infinite contribution to the particle mass .",
    "the most likely candidate is supersymmetry ( susy ) , which provides supersymmetric partners whose effect exactly cancels that of the known particles .",
    "this beautiful cancellation is due to a minus sign difference in the contributions of the fermions , or spin 1/2 particles , and the bosons , or spin 1 and spin 0 particles .",
    "if the lhc does in fact discover susy after it resumes operations ( in 2015 ) , with its energy almost doubled from 8 to 14 tev , it will mean both a new fundamental symmetry of nature and a plethora of new _",
    "sparticles _ to match the known particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9-susyparticles_sm.eps ] .    .",
    "these can be combined to form four fields and particles with well - defined masses .",
    "one of these _ neutralinos _ has the lowest mass , and is therefore stable in supersymmetic theories where ( i ) neutral sparticles have lower mass than charged sparticles and ( ii ) r - parity is conserved , with r - parity@xmath26 for ordinary particles and @xmath27 for sparticles .",
    "the lightest neutralino is therefore a candidate for the dark matter of the universe .",
    "furthermore , since it experiences only the weak force ( plus gravity ) , it turns out in detailed calculations to have emerged , from the hot universe following the big bang , with about the right density to explain the observed density of dark matter .",
    "credit : desy [ fig9-susyparticles_sm.eps],width=480 ]    the higgs is also of central importance for other reasons . for example , it is related to the quest for a grand unified theory ( gut ) of all the nongravitational forces : the electromagnetic force , the strong nuclear force which holds quarks together in a proton or neutron ( and protons and neutrons together in an atomic nucleus ) , and the weak nuclear force which causes radioactive beta decay .",
    "such a theory will surely entail higgs - like fields which condense at much higher energies .",
    "finally , as discussed below , some of the greatest problems in cosmology are closely associated with the higgs .",
    "one is the _ cosmological constant problem _  the fact that there should be a vacuum energy which is 50 or even 120 orders of magnitude larger than permitted by observation .",
    "people started worrying seriously about this problem after it was recognized that the vacuum should be occupied by the very dense higgs condensate .",
    "now there is also a second cosmological constant problem : observations of type 1a supernovas ( exploding white dwarfs ) , plus other astronomical observations , demonstrate that there is a _ dark energy _ which behaves like a cosmological constant ( or vacuum energy )  relatively weak compared to the one of theory , but strong enough to dominate all other sources of gravity on a cosmic scale .",
    "another problem related to the higgs is the origin of _ inflation _ in the early universe , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2b - cmb_timeline.eps ] .",
    "such an extremely rapid expansion of the universe ( at about @xmath28 second after its birth ) would explain the nearly _ scale - free fluctuations _ in the cosmic microwave background radiation .",
    "these have been observed by the planck , wmap , and cobe satellite experiments , and the results from planck are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2a-planck-cmb.eps ] .",
    "there is still no fully convincing model for inflation , but it would follow from the condensation of an appropriate `` inflaton '' field , quite similar to condensation of the higgs field .    ,",
    "width=480 ]    .",
    "credit : european space agency and the planck collaboration [ fig2a-planck-cmb.eps],width=480 ]    below we will discuss in detail how the higgs gives masses to the particles of fig . 1 .",
    "but it is worth mentioning why this is important .",
    "when one uses the bohr model to calculate the radius of the orbit of an electron in its ground state in the hydrogen atom , the result is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of an electron , @xmath31 is the coulomb s law constant , and @xmath32 is the fundamental electric charge .",
    "a full quantum calculation yields a probability distribution for the electron , rather than an orbit , but gives the same result for the position of the peak in the radial probability density . as @xmath33 , the size of the atom then @xmath34 .",
    "similar results hold for other atoms , so without the higgs condensate there would be no atoms or ordinary matter .",
    "there are two basic origins of mass .",
    "the first was discovered by albert einstein and published in one of his miraculous 1905 papers : @xmath35 , or @xmath36 .",
    "( his other papers introduced the theory of relativity , the particle - wave duality of quantum mechanics , and convincing proof for atoms  at the same time that the eminent physicist ernst mach was expressing strong opposition to the atomic theory ) .",
    "about 99% of the mass of a proton , neutron , atom , or human body has this origin , in the kinetic energy of partons ",
    "i.e. , quarks and gluons  whizzing around inside each nucleon .",
    "the higgs mechanism discussed below represents the second way in which mass can originate : through the coupling of a particle to a bosonic field that undergoes condensation .",
    "here we consider the origin of particle masses within the sm , leaving neutrinos for the next section . in the sm ,",
    "neutrinos have zero mass , but a number of heroic experiments , some of which are featured in figs .",

    "bahcall s calculations showed that the emitted number of @xmath37 should be three times the number of @xmath37 measured by davis .",
    "the amazing fact was that this was not due to a failure of the experiment or an incorrect model of reactions deep inside the sun .",
    "it instead resulted from conversion of the @xmath37 into all three of the neutrinos in fig .",
    "[ fig1-fn0266h ] , with this mixing being a result of their having masses .",
    "credit : r. svoboda , uc davis , super - kamiokande collaboration [ fig7-sun-neutrinos.eps],width=480 ]    various analogies have been offered for how the higgs field gives mass to a matter particle . in each of these , the analogous effect is primarily relevant to velocity , whereas inertial mass is instead resistance to acceleration .",
    "but the spirit is correct .",
    "the analogy of john ellis is to motion over a snow field , which represents the higgs field .",
    "people wearing skis , snowshoes , or boots are respectively analogous to neutrinos , electrons , or top quarks , with little or no coupling to the higgs field , moderate coupling , or strong coupling .",
    "another analogy is motion through a field of party - goers .",
    "a nondescript stranger , a charming person like the reader of this article , and a celebrity like paul mccartney will receive different degrees of attention from the crowd , and their attempts to move across the room will be impeded in proportion to their popularity .    a readable description of the research , and references to recent popular books on this general subject ,",
    "can be found in the popular science background published by the royal swedish academy of sciences  @xcite .",

    "we will now skip past a great deal of mathematics , and briefly outline 85 years of historical developments : after the introduction of quantum mechanics and einstein s special theory of relativity , these two aspects of modern physics were combined in 1928 by paul dirac , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7a-dirac.eps ] .",

    "an expression like ( [ eq2.1 ] ) should also be invariant under a _ gauge transformation _ , in which both the matter fields and the force fields , described by _ vector potentials _ @xmath44 , are each transformed in a specific way .",
    "it is outside the scope of this article to define precisely what this means , but the basic idea is that the matter fields ( represented by column arrays in fig .",
    "[ fig7b-fields.eps ] ) are rotated , in the same way that a vector ( represented by its components ) might be rotated .",
    "then the force fields are also transformed , in such a way that the joint effect of transforming matter fields and force fields exactly cancels in a physically valid fundamental theory .",
