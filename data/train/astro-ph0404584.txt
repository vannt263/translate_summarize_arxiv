    "it was the common expectation that , with the increase in the precision of rv measurements , the detected secondary masses of spectroscopic binaries will gradually decrease , first into the brown dwarf mass range ( @xmath5 ) and eventually into the planetary mass regime of roughly @xmath6 ( below the deuterium burning limit ) .",
    "quite the opposite turned out to happen .",
    "the pioneering long - term doppler survey of campbell , walker , & yang ( 1988 ) , and later also in the southern hemisphere by murdoch , hearnshaw , & clark  ( 1993 ) , did not reveal any brown dwarf companions to nearby solar - type stars , despite their sufficient sensitivity .",
    "there appeared to be an abrupt drop in the frequency of companions at the hydrogen burning limit of @xmath7 .",
    "the first very low - mass companion ( @xmath8 ) detected by the rv technique is the companion to hd  114762 ( latham et al .",
    "the discoverers classified the object as a brown dwarf companion , but according to cochran , hatzes , & hancock  ( 1991 ) this companion might be in fact a late m dwarf due to a possible low value of the inclination angle @xmath9 . in the years after the discovery of the first unambiguous extrasolar planet orbiting a main - sequence star by mayor & queloz ( 1995 ) ,",
    "a total of more than a @xmath10 extrasolar planets have been accumulated by several precise doppler searches all around the globe .",
    "still , with a few exceptions ( hd  127506 : mayor , queloz , & udry  1998 ; hd  29587 & hd  140913 : mazeh , latham , & stefanik  1996 ; hd  168443 ( second companion ) : marcy & butler  2001 ; hd  184860 : vogt et al .",
    "2002 ) , the part of the mass function for spectroscopic secondaries , in between the minimum hydrogen burning mass and the deuterium burning limit of @xmath11 , remained surprisingly sparsely populated . a notable exception is hd  10697 , where vogt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected a companion with @xmath12 , while zucker & mazeh ( 2000 ) determined a true mass for the secondary of @xmath13 after combining the spectroscopic solution with @xmath14 astrometry .",
    "udry et al .  (",
    "2002 ) found 4 companions with minimum masses close to the planet / brown dwarf border , which could be either `` superplanets '' or real brown dwarfs .",
    "however , most of the candidate brown dwarf secondaries considered in the halbwachs et al .",
    "( 2000 ) study turned out to be stellar mass companions , again after combination with @xmath14 astrometry .",
    "this suggests the existence of two distinctive binary formation processes for certain mass - ratios .",
    "the gap in the mass function between the stellar and planetary mass range for close binaries is generally dubbed the `` brown dwarf desert '' ( this desert does not appear to exist at wide separations , e.g. gizis et al .",
    "2001 ; neuhuser & guenther 2004 ) .",
    "the gap is particularily obvious as a sudden drop at the deuterium burning limit in the substellar mass function for close companions . while planets are relatively common as companions to solar - type stars , brown dwarfs are rare",
    "this fact is especially surprising since brown dwarf companions are much easier to detect , even for lower precision surveys , due to the larger rv amplitudes .",
    "moreover , these objects cover a more than 4 times larger mass range than planetary companions , still their detected numbers per mass bin is extremely low compared to lower and higher mass companions .    in this work we present the discovery of another possible `` oasis '' in this desert , a brown dwarf orbiting the g - type star hd  137510 .",
    "hd  137510 (= hr  5740 = hip  75535 ) is a bright ( @xmath15 ) g - type star at a distance of @xmath16 pc , according to the @xmath14 parallax of @xmath17 mas ( esa  1997 ) . in order to derive the stellar parameters for the primary we used the ( b - v)-@xmath18 calibration of alonso , arribas , & martnez - roger  ( 1996 ) , compared @xmath19 and @xmath18 with stellar evolution calculations ( e.g. reddy et al .",
    "2003 ) , and performed a model atmosphere analysis of a high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectrum of hd  137510 .",
    "we find that the star has a mass of @xmath20 , an effective temperature @xmath21  k , a @xmath22 of @xmath23 , a radius @xmath24 of @xmath25 and an age of @xmath26  gyrs .",
    "an iron abundance analysis yields @xmath27}= 0.16\\pm0.07 $ ]  dex .",
    "the object is thus metal rich compared to the sun .",
    "we also find substantial rotational broadening of the spectral lines , the value of @xmath28 can be constrained in the range @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with ( or very close to ) those determined by lbre et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and do  nascimento  et al .",
    "it thus appears that hd  137510 was a metal rich late f - type star which has now started its evolution away from the main sequence .",
    "interestingly , smith , cunha , & lazzaro  ( 2001 ) have noted that hd  137510 possibly underwent chemically fractioned accretion and represents a good candidate for having a close - in giant planetary companion .",
    "we carried out observations of hd  137510 as part of the ongoing doppler surveys for extrasolar planets using the harlan j. smith 2.7  m telescope at mcdonald observatory ( mcd ) in west texas and the 2.0  m alfred jensch telescope at thringer landessternwarte tautenburg ( tls ) in germany . in september 1998 a first spectrum of hd  137510",
    "was taken at mcd , but rv monitoring was discontinued for almost three years . in may",
    "2001 observations of hd  137510 were started at tls , while at the same time monitoring was resumed at mcd .",
    "for both programs we use a temperature stabilized molecular iodine vapor ( i@xmath31 ) cell as the velocity metric . to obtain the high precision differential rv measurements we employ specialized data modeling techniques , which include the detailed reconstruction of the instrumental profile of the respective spectrometers at the time of observation ( valenti , butler , & marcy  1995 ; butler et al .",
    "1996 ; endl , krster , & els  2000 ) .",
    "[ orbit_time ] displays our rv data as a function of time and with the best - fit keplerian orbital solution superimposed .",
    "we employ the program @xmath32 ( mcarthur , jefferys , mccartney  1994 ) , which uses a robust estimation method to find orbital solutions for each data set ( mcd and tls ) independently , as well as a combined solution , where the arbitrary velocity zero points ( @xmath33 velocities ) of both data sets are included as fit parameters .",
    "table  [ orbittab ] summarizes the parameters we determined for the orbit . the resulting mass function of this binary yields a minimum mass for the companion of @xmath34 .",
    "table  [ vels ] lists our doppler measurements for hd  137510 .",
    "the residual scatter around this orbital fit is unusually high , mcd : @xmath35 and tls : @xmath36 , roughly a factor of @xmath37 worse than the routine rv precision for each telescope system .",
    "it also exceeds the average internal measurement errors of both data sets ( mcd : @xmath38 , tls : @xmath39 ) .",
    "stellar activity can introduce additional noise in rv data at that level of measurement precision ( e.g. saar & donahue  1997 ) .",
    "for hd  137510 we can rule out this possibility , based on the general low ca ii h&k emission of this star .",
    "the mcd spectra , for which we determined the rvs , also include the ca ii h&k lines , two well known activity indicators .",
    "we find a mcd s - index @xmath40 ( see section 2.3 in paulson et al .",
    "2002 for a detailed description of how we obtain the s - index for the ca ii k line core emission ) .",
    "this is a comparable emission level as the well known inactive star @xmath41  ceti ( @xmath42 ) and shows that hd  137510 is not an active star .",
    "furthermore , the star does not show up as an x - ray source in the rosat all - sky survey results ( hnsch , schmitt , & voges  1998 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the higher scatter is the substantial rotational broadening of the spectral lines in the case of hd  137510 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the larger scatter for the tls data likely reflects the differences both in telescope aperture ( tls : @xmath44  m ; mcd : @xmath45  m ) as well as in the relative seeing conditions at these two sites .",
    "another possible explanation is the presence of a second low - level keplerian signal .",
    "we searched in the rv residuals for periodic signals using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb  1976 , scargle  1982 ) .",
    "while the two separate periodograms of the individual sets of residuals do not reveal a significant signal , we do find a strong signal with a period of @xmath46 days in the combined residuals .",
    "this warrants further intensive monitoring of hd  137510 to confirm a possible planetary companion at a separation of @xmath47  au ( which would make this system very interesting from a dynamical standpoint ) .",
    "due to the general sparseness of brown dwarf rv companions we have to look for additional clues in order to rule out a stellar mass companion producing the detected keplerian signal :    simply based on the probabilty of a random distribution of the inclination angle @xmath9 , we already have a @xmath48 probability that @xmath9 is larger than @xmath49 , which translates into a true mass of @xmath50 , still below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "we measure a @xmath28 of @xmath29 to @xmath30 for hd  137510 , which is a typical value for a g0iv star .",
    "the mean @xmath28 value of the f8 - g2 subgiants in the de medeiros & mayor ( 1999 ) catalogue is @xmath51 ( excluding one fast rotating f8iv star the mean value drops to @xmath52 ) .",
    "this shows that the value for hd  137510 is not atypically low , which means that we probably do not have a near pole - on view on the primary star . assuming that the orbital plane is roughly perpendicular to the rotation axis of the star we , again",
    ", do not seem to face a low @xmath9 scenario in this case .",
    "mcalister et al .  (",
    "1987 ) obtained a negative result for this star in their speckle survey for duplicity among bright star catalogue stars using the cfht .",
    "granted , a positive detection would have been a difficult one , close to the diffraction limit of the telescope ( @xmath53 arcsec ) .",
    "hd  137510 has no flag in the multiple / binary annex of the @xmath14 catalogue , showing that no suspicious astrometric variation was discovered .",
    "according to lindegren et al .",
    "( 1997 ) a stochastic solution is chosen for objects where no acceptable single or double star solution can be found and additional noise , typically ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 mas , needs to be added until an acceptable fit is found .",
    "if we regard the @xmath54 mas as the lower limit of an astrometric pertubation ( angular size of the semimajor axis ) which would have shown up in the analysis of the @xmath14 data of a bright target like hd  137510 , we can exclude inclination angles of @xmath56 and a true mass of the companion of @xmath57 , using the constraint of pourbaix & jorissen ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have presented observational evidence for the substellar nature of the companion to hd  137510 . _",
    "the question , why this star constitutes one of the very rare oases in the brown dwarf desert , remains unanswered .",
    "_ however , due to the well established parameters of the primary and the orbit , this new system might help to understand binary formation processes for these mass - ratios at small orbital separations .",
    "we are grateful to the mcdonald observatory time - allocation - committee for generous allocation of observing time .",
