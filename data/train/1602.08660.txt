    "the technology of gesture computing enables humans to communicate with the machine and interact naturally without any mechanical devices ; see fig .  1 for a schematic illustration .        typically , a gesture - based computing technology consists of three major ingredients : the computing machine , the recognition device and the human being who gives orders / instructions to the computer .",
    "the recognition device understands human body language , say the hand gesture , and interprets it as specific orders / instructions for the computing machine .",
    "hence , it acts as a bridge between the computing machine and the human being . using the concept of gesture recognition ,",
    "it is possible to wave the hand to start the computer and point a finger at the computer screen so that the cursor will move accordingly .",
    "this would enrich the communication interfaces between machines and humans other than the conventional text user interfaces or graphical user interfaces , which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse .",
    "we refer to @xcite for reviews on the state - of - the - art development on gesture computing technology , as well as the interesting wikipedia article @xcite for a comprehensive introduction .",
    "according to our discussion above , the recognition device plays the key role for a successful implementation of the technology . in nowaday technology",
    ", one usually utilizes cameras to capture the images of a person s movements and then the gesture recognition can be conducted with techniques from computer vision and imaging processing .",
    "though there is a large amount of research done in image / video based gesture recognition , there are still many challenges to make the technology more practically useful . in this paper , we present a conceptual design of a novel gesture recognition device , which is different to the conventional image / video - based one . in our design ,",
    "we use wave signals for the gesture detection and recognition ; see fig .  2 for a schematic illustration of the novel gesture recognition device .",
    "the gestures are modelled as shapes of some penetrable or impenetrable scatterers . in order to identity the shapes ( and thus the gestures ) , a transmitter will send out wave signals .",
    "the propagation of the wave field will be interrupted when meeting with the human body performing the gesture , and this generates the so - called scattered wave .",
    "then some receivers will collect the scattered data and from which to identify the shapes of the scattering objects , namely the gestures .",
    "we are aware of some very recent engineering development by google in project soli of using radar to identify hand gestures , along with some very interesting technological applications ; see @xcite .        in order to motivate the setup of our novel design , we take a practical scenario as an illustrative example for our subsequent exposition .",
    "let us assume that the gesture recognition device is installed behind the screen of a personal desktop computer , which takes orders / instructions from gestures performed by a person in front of the computer . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "there are transmitters sending the wave signals and receivers collecting the scattered waves for the gesture recognition . in our design",
    ", we only use a single transmitter which generates point wave signals .",
    "there is an array of receivers distributed on a bounded surface containing the transmitter .",
    "first , we emphasize that from a practical viewpoint , the aperture of the receivers can not be very large .",
    "second , in order to single out the wave signals for the gesture recognition from possible noises , we shall make use of time - harmonic waves with specified frequencies , namely wavenumbers .",
    "finally , the recognition must be conducted in a timely manner .",
    "indeed , we take account of all these practical factors into our study .",
    "we shall make use of two time - harmonic point sources with , respectively , a low wavenumber and a regular wavenumber ( in terms of the size of the human body ) .",
    "the backscattering data of a small aperture are measured on a bounded surface containing the point sources .",
    "in fact , we can even make use of the phaseless data .",
    "the recognition algorithm consists of two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we determine the location of the scatterer by using the measured data at a small wavenumber . in the second step , with the information of the location of the scatterer",
    ", we then identify the shape of the scatterer using the measured data at a regular wavenumber .",
    "our proposed recognition method is computationally very fast , and it is of a totally  direct \" nature without any inversion involved .",
    "hence , our design nicely addresses all the practical concerns mentioned earlier .",
    "it is pointed out that the mathematical principle of our novel design is a typical inverse scattering problem , where one sends wave fields and collects the scattered wave data , and finally uses the data to identify the unknown scatterer .",
    "the study on inverse scattering problems is central to many areas of science and technology , including radar / sonar , geophysical exploration and medical imaging .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for related studies on inverse scattering problems .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize that our study is new to the literature and would meet significant challenges even in the setting of inverse scattering study . as discussed earlier",
    ", we shall make use of only two point sources for the identification .",
    "the shape identification using a minimum number of scattering measurements is known as the schiffer s problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and remains to be a longstanding open problem in the literature .",
    "there is some significant progress on the schiffer s problem in determining general polyhedral scatterers @xcite , and in approximately determining general scatterers @xcite .",
    "another challenging issue in our study is the phaseless measurement data in a limited aperture .",
    "the inverse scattering problems with phaseless data are notoriously difficult in the literature and we refer to @xcite for some recent progress .",
    "a key assumption in our study which can alleviate the mathematical challenges that we are confronting with for the novel gesture recognition device is that the shapes are a priori known to be from an admissible class , called a _",
    "dictionary_. this is a practically reasonable assumption since one can calibrate the gesture recognition device beforehand by collecting the scattering information of the admissible gestures .",
    "it is noted that there are some existing studies in recovering scatterers from an admissible class or dictionary ; see @xcite . among others ,",
    "one distinctive novelty of our this study lies at the very little scattering information that we use for the identification .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the mathematical principle study of the novel gesture recognition device . in section 3",
    ", we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show and verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed recognition algorithm .",
    "in this section , we present the mathematical modelling and the recognition algorithm for the proposed gesture - based computing device . following our discussion in section  [ sect:1 ] ,",
    "we let @xmath0 be a time - harmonic point source with a wavenumber @xmath1 located at the origin , where @xmath2 is the fundamental solution of the pdo , @xmath3 ; namely @xmath4 . by factoring out the time - oscillating part , in what follows",
    ", we simply write @xmath5 to denote the time - harmonic point signal located at the origin .",
    "we model the shape of the body of the person who performs the gestures as a bounded lipschitz domain @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath6 possesses a connected complement , @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed earlier in section  [ sect:1 ] that the gesture recognition device can be calibrated beforehand , we assume that there exists an _",
    "admissible class _ or a _ dictionary _ of lipschitz domains , @xmath8 where each @xmath9 is simply connected and contains the origin , such that @xmath10 it is also assumed that @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the location of @xmath6 in .",
    "the assumption means that the euclidean size of the scatterer @xmath6 can be calibrated so that we could choose the low frequency in the sense that @xmath14 or the regular frequency in the sense that @xmath15 , of the point source for the gesture recognition .",
    "the assumption means that the person performing the gesture instructions should stay away from the device of a sufficiently large distance .",
    "however , it is emphasized that this condition is mainly needed in our theoretical justification of the gesture recognition algorithm in what follows .",
    "indeed , in our numerical experiments , it can be seen that as long as the scatterer @xmath6 is located away from the point source of a reasonable distance , then the recognition method can work effectively and efficiently to recover the scatterer .    due to the presence of the scatterer @xmath6 , the propagation of the point wave will be interrupted , leading to the so - called _",
    "scattering_. denote by @xmath16 the interrupted / scattered wave field associated with the scatterer @xmath17 and the point source @xmath18 in .",
    "let @xmath19 denote a bounded surface containing the origin such that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath19 . in our gesture recognition study",
    ", @xmath22 denotes the measurement surface such that one measures the scattered wave field @xmath23 and from which to recover the shape of the scatterer @xmath6 ; that is , @xmath24 . for a timely recognition , we shall only makes use of two point waves of the form for two values of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , from a practical point of view , we shall mainly consider two cases that @xmath6 is impenetrable being soft or @xmath6 is penetrable being a medium scatterer .",
    "the case that @xmath6 is soft corresponds to the case that the person wears a certain equipment which prevents the wave field from penetrating inside the body ; and the case that @xmath6 is a medium scatterer correspond to the generic situation where the wave field can pass through the body .",
    "we first consider the case where @xmath17 is soft , namely @xmath17 is impenetrable to the wave and there holds the homogeneous boundary condition @xmath26 on @xmath27 . in the frequency domain ,",
    "the wave scattering is governed by the following pde system for @xmath28 , @xmath29      u_{\\kappa}^{\\omega}= - u_{\\kappa}^{\\rm in } \\quad { \\rm on}~{\\partial}{\\omega}^{\\rm ex } , \\\\[5pt ]      \\displaystyle{\\lim_{r \\to \\infty } r \\left ( \\frac{{\\partial}}{{\\partial}r } - { \\mathrm{i}}{\\kappa}\\right ) u_{\\kappa}^{\\omega}= 0 , }    \\end{cases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and the limit holds uniformly for all @xmath31 , where @xmath32 denotes the unit sphere in @xmath33 . the last limit in is known as the sommerfeld tradition condition , which characterizes the decaying property of the scattered wave field away from the scatterer .",
    "the scattering system is well understood @xcite , and there exists a unique solution @xmath34 which possesses the following asymptotic expansion as @xmath35 , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is known as the far - field pattern for @xmath28 , and @xmath38 is called the observation direction .",
    "the inverse scattering problem concerning the gesture recognition is to identify @xmath39 from the measurement of the scattered field on @xmath22 due to @xmath17 . noting that @xmath24 , where @xmath40 is the location of the scatterer and the shape @xmath41 is from the dictionary . for the recovery of @xmath42",
    ", it would be advantageous of decoupling the information on @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the scattered wave field @xmath43 .",
    "this can be done if the incident wave field is a plane wave of the form @xmath44 with @xmath45",
    "denoting the incident direction , and one can make use of a certain translation relation ; see @xcite .",
    "for the current study with the incident wave being a point signal , our first step is derive a similar relation in order to decouple the information of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the scattered wave field that is measured on @xmath22 .",
    "the main idea arises from the crucial observation that @xmath46 near @xmath17 can be approximated by a plane wave propagating in the @xmath47-direction .",
    "this is also the reason why we need to assume that the scatterer is located at a reasonably large distance away from the origin which is the location of both the point source and the measurement surface .",
    "nevertheless , we would like to emphasize again that this assumption is mainly required in our theoretical justification , and our numerical experiments show that even without this assumption , the proposed recognition algorithm still works effectively and efficiently .    in what follows ,",
    "if the incident wave @xmath48 in the scattering system is replaced by a plane wave @xmath44 , then we write @xmath49 , @xmath50 , to denote the corresponding scattered wave field , and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , to denote the associated far - field pattern",

    "it is pointed out that the brakhage - werner trick of using combined layer potentials to represent the wave solution is to avoid the interior eigenvalue problem .",
    "that is , if @xmath83 and @xmath84 is a dirichlet eigenvalue to @xmath85 in @xmath41 , then the integral operator @xmath86 in is no longer invertible .",
    "hence , if one assumes that @xmath84 is not a dirichlet laplacian eigenvalue to @xmath41 , then one can simply use the double - layer potential to represent the solution @xmath87 in .",
    "particularly , in such a case , by using the mapping properties of the double layer potential operator when @xmath41 is a lipschitz domain in @xcite , one can follow a completely similar argument as above to show that the theorem holds when @xmath61 is only lipschitz - continuous .",
    "then case that @xmath61 is lipschitz - continuous and also @xmath84 is a dirichlet laplacian eigenvalue would need more technical argument by following the techniques in @xcite",
