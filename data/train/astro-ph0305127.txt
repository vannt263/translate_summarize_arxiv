    "stars and planets form in a closely coupled process that is generally accessible to study only at relatively long wavelengths , from infrared to radio .",
    "observational studies of this process have generally suffered from one or more of the following problems : biased samples , inadequate sensitivity , inadequate spatial resolution , or incomplete data across the wavelength ranges of interest . the _ space infrared telescope facility _ ( ) offers a singular opportunity for a major advance in this area of research .",
    "the mission has been described by gallagher , irace , & werner ( 2002 ) .    our legacy program ,  from molecular cores to planet - forming disks",
    ", \" uses 400 hours of  observations to study the process of star and planet formation from the earliest stages of molecular cores to the epoch of planet - forming disks .",
    "this program , hereafter referred to simply as ",
    "cores to disks \" or c2d , is closely coordinated with the legacy program on  formation and evolution of planetary systems \" or feps , which carries the age sequence to later times .",
    "our program uses all three  instruments : the _ infrared array camera _ or , covering 3.6 to 8  ( fazio et al .",
    "1998 ) ; the _ multiband imaging photometer for sirtf _ or , covering 24 to 160  ( engelbracht et al . 2000 ) ; and the _ infrared spectrometer _ , or , supplying spectroscopy from 5.3 to 40  with resolving power @xmath0 and from 10 to 37  with @xmath1 ( houck et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the observational programs , described in greater detail in the individual sections , include unbiased mapping of 5 large nearby molecular clouds and about 150 compact molecular cores (  [ cores ] ) , photometry of about 190 stars with ages up to about 10 myr (  [ stars ] ) , and spectroscopy of at least 170 objects in a wide range of evolutionary states (  [ irs ] ) . in these sections , we discuss the scientific questions , the sample selection , the planned observations , and the expected results .",
    "the data products are summarized in  [ datprod ] .",
    "we also describe _ ancillary _ data , which are part of the c2d data products , and _ complementary _ data , which are being obtained by us or others to provide a more complete picture .",
    "the  and ancillary data will be available to the broader community from the _ sirtf science center _ ( ) , via their infrared sky archive ( irsa ) .",
    "complementary data products will be made available , as far as possible , through either irsa or public web sites .",
    "further information on the program can be found at the c2d website : http://peggysue.as.utexas.edu / sirtf/.",
    "the  mission offers an unprecedented opportunity to determine the stellar content of the nearest star - forming molecular clouds , the distributions of their youngest stars and substellar objects , and the properties of their circumstellar envelopes and disks . just as  and",
    "revealed many properties of isolated and clustered star - forming regions ,  will yield new insights into how stars and brown dwarfs are born . among the specific questions that our program will address",
    "are the following .",
    "\\1 . in large cloud complexes",
    ", how are the youngest stars and substellar objects distributed , in position and mass ?",
    "the  and  maps of large complexes will reveal the reddest , and presumably youngest , associated objects .",
    "is their distribution  bimodal \" between singles and clusters , or is there a more continuous distibution of multiplicity ? is the distribution of young stars better correlated with line - of - sight extinction , the supply of dense gas , or with proximity to other young stars , a measure of triggering or cooperative star formation ?",
    "do the answers to these questions depend on the mass of the object  for example , can brown dwarfs form in isolation , as can ordinary low - mass stars , or do they require proximity to stars , as expected if they originate primarily in circumstellar disks or in small stellar groups ?",
    "\\2 . what is the incidence of circumstellar disks in complexes and in isolated cores ?",
    "the excess emission over that of a stellar photosphere at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths indicates the presence of a circumstellar disk , the birthplace of planets . to improve understanding of the factors that influence",
    "disk dissipation and survival , our sample includes a wide range of complex and isolated star - forming regions .",
    "this comparison will differ from past studies of disk incidence in its greater sensitivity to faint objects , in its unbiased coverage of large cloud areas , and in its inclusion of isolated cores not in complexes .",
    "starless \" isolated cores harbor faint protostars ?",
    "starless or ",
    "pre - protostellar \" cores have no pointlike infrared emission according to ground - based near - infrared observations and far - infrared observations by the  and  satellites .",
    "these cores are prime targets for studies of the initial conditions of isolated star formation , and some such cores have associated internal motions suggestive of the early stages of star formation .",
    "s sensitivity will allow detection of extremely young protostars and proto - brown - dwarfs missed by earlier observations .",
    "identification of such objects would stimulate more detailed studies and so would advance our understanding of the earliest stage of star formation .",
    "what are the statistical lifetimes of various stages ?",
    "our survey covers a large area and will catalog a large number of young and embedded systems .",
    "these data will allow the first unbiased statistical studies of the complete stellar content of five large clouds .",
    "in addition , systems that are statistically rare and systems in rapid phases of evolution will be present in the sample .",
    "we may , for example , find systems in the short - lived phase in which the first hydrostatic core forms , a crucial , but so far unobserved stage of star formation ( boss & yorke 1995 ) .",
    "do isolated cores with associated stars preferentially harbor single stars or small stellar groups ?",
    "observations by  and   led to the idea of  one core , one star \" : an isolated core or globule tends to form a single star or an unresolved binary , as opposed to a small group of 3 to 10 members .",
    "in large molecular clouds , many isolated  point sources are accompanied by groups of near - infrared sources that constitute the more evolved members of a small stellar group ( e.g. , hodapp 1994 )",
    ".  will be much more sensitive to faint emission from nearby sources than was  and , allowing us to test whether truly isolated star formation occurs .",
    "\\6 . what is the density structure of individual cores ?",
    "some isolated starless cores have a density structure similar to that of a pressure - bounded isothermal sphere , according to observations of their submillimeter  dust emission and of their near - infrared absorption of background starlight .",
    "these cores have a single local maximum of density and tend to make single stars .",
    "line profiles toward these cores usually indicate low levels of turbulence .",
    "in contrast , cores in cluster - forming regions appear to have more complex density structure , and their spectral lines indicate more turbulent conditions .",
    "deep  imaging of such cores will reveal their detailed structure through mapping the extinction of background stars .",
    "this structure will be compared with that of isolated cores to improve understanding of the initial conditions for stellar groups .",
    "our sample of the nearest star - forming molecular clouds covers a range of cloud `` types '' broad enough to encompass all modes of star formation and sufficient in number to allow robust statistical conclusions . to ensure a wide variety of star - forming conditions , we target five large complexes known to be forming stars in isolation , in groups , and in clusters , and 156 small , isolated cores  110 starless and 46 with associated  sources .",
    "the five large clouds selected for mapping , listed in table 1 , satisfy the following criteria : they contain a substantial mass of molecular gas ; they are actively forming stars ; they are within 350 pc ; and they can be mapped in a reasonable amount of time .",
    "table 1 gives for each target region the distance , the area to be mapped with irac , and the full time for irac and mips observations , including off - cloud comparison fields .",
    "although the distance criterion excludes some important star - forming regions , such as the orion clouds , it was imposed to ensure that our  observations would be sensitive to brown dwarfs .",
    "the perseus cloud is the most distant cloud at 320 pc ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "1999 ) , though previous distance estimates range from 220 pc ( ernis 1990 ) to 350 pc ( herbig & jones 1983 ) .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud satisfies most criteria but is too large to be mapped within the time allocated .",
    "the selected complexes span a wide range of conditions .",
    "the most quiescent and least opaque are lupus and chamaeleon ii , whose young stars are isolated or in sparse groups , and whose gas has low extinction and narrow lines .",
    "the most turbulent complexes are perseus , ophiuchus , and serpens , with more densely clustered stars .",
    "the guaranteed time observers ( s ) will observe smaller regions in many of these clouds .",
    "our goal is to provide complete and unbiased coverage down to a set  limit .",
    "selection of the compact molecular cores proceeded in three steps : selection of a large sample with inclusive criteria ; classification into cores with and without known internal luminosity sources (  stars \" ) ; and reduction of the sample to eliminate objects being observed by s and to fit within the allowed time .",
    "the latter requirement resulted in removing cores with less robust evidence for dense gas and dust .",
    "the initial criteria for selection of the isolated dense core sample were that the distance is less than 400 pc , that the size is not too large ( typically less than @xmath2 ) , and that the core has been mapped in a dense gas tracer , typically nh@xmath3 ( jijina , myers & adams 1999 ) , cs ( lee , myers & tafalla 2001 ) , and/or n@xmath4h@xmath5  ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ; caselli et al .",
    "2002 ) . to supplement this list , we searched the ads and astro - ph databases for other cores mapped in these tracers but not included in these catalogs , or mapped in other dense gas tracers , such as hco@xmath5 , hcn , and h@xmath4co .",
    "we also added cores with dust continuum emission but without published maps in tracers of dense gas .",
    "cores where more than one dense gas tracer had been detected , but no map exists , were added to include bok globules whose size can be estimated from their optical extinction .    to determine whether a core has an associated  star , \" meaning a central luminosity source at any evolutionary stage , we used the catalog of lee & myers ( 1999 ) . for embedded sources ( class 0 and class i ) , they searched the iras database and required the following to be true .",
    "the projected position of the iras source on the sky should fall within the contour of least extinction defining the optical extent of the core .",
    "the source should be detected in at least two wavebands .",
    "the detected flux densities ( @xmath6 ) should be greater in the longer wavelength band .",
    "however , sources with @xmath7 or @xmath8 were included as long as @xmath9 . to select pre - main - sequence  stars from the iras catalog the color - color criteria of weintraub ( 1990 ) was used by lee & myers ( 1999 ) , which requires @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the herbig & bell ( 1988 ) catalog of pre - main - sequence  stars was also searched .",
    "other cores with stars were identified on a core by core basis from the literature ; e.g. , iram 04191 + 1522 was not detected by iras , but was identified by its dust continuum emission ( andr , motte & bacmann 1999 ) and found to have a central source .",
    "this candidate target list was cross - checked against the  lists and the area to be mapped by us in the 5 large molecular clouds to remove overlap . in order to fit the time allocation ,",
    "the list was further reduced by eliminating cores not detected at all in cs and n@xmath4h@xmath5 , or detected , but not mapped , in a dense gas tracer and detected only weakly in millimeter  or submillimeter  continuum .      the molecular cloud complexes and isolated cores",
    "will be observed with both  and  at all wavelengths from 3.6 to 160 , but we expect the 160 @xmath12 m detector to be saturated toward these regions . because most of the molecular clouds in our sample are at low ecliptic latitude ( @xmath13 ) , all observations will be made at two epochs separated by 3 to 6 hours in order to identify faint asteroids .",
    "one set of observations will be made in the high dynamic range mode of irac to minimize saturation on bright sources .",
    "the boundaries for four of the five large cloud maps were defined using optical extinction maps from cambrsy ( 1999 ) ( see figures  [ cham ] to [ serpens ] ) . a @xmath14co map ( padoan et al .",
    "1999 , figure  [ perseus ] ) was used to define the perseus molecular cloud .",
    "the  map of perseus will include nearly all of the area mapped in @xmath14co ; this region corresponds to an @xmath15 as inferred from maps of near - infrared colors ( carpenter , pers .",
    "comm . ) generated using the 2mass point source catalog ( cutri et al .",
    "for the other clouds , an  level was chosen so that each map could cover a continuous area of high extinction within the allocated time . in most cases ,",
    "@xmath16 or 3 defined the cloud edge .",
    "however , the serpens cloud boundary was limited to @xmath17 because lower levels merge into unrelated extinction in the galactic plane .",
    "several factors shaped the detailed observing strategy for the large clouds . in ophiuchus and perseus , some regions will saturate the  70  detector .",
    "each saturated region was quarantined by limiting it to a single  astronomical observation request ( aor ) so that the data in the surrounding regions would not be adversely affected .",
    "point sources will also saturate ; the after - image may leave a trail in the direction of the  scans . in order to obtain usable data in such regions ,  will scan in the opposite direction for the second epoch observations .",
    "additionally , many of our cloud maps overlap designated   regions .",
    "therefore , unnecessary duplicate observations had to be avoided .",
    "another factor considered in the observation planning was cloud orientation .",
    "the sky orientation of sirtf maps for high ecliptic latitude targets , such as chamaeleon ii and serpens , rotates rapidly . in order to eliminate the possibility of gaps in the maps due to this rotation ,",
    "the overlap between adjacent aors was increased , or the observations were constrained to specific position angles .",
    "we also plan observations of off - cloud positions in order to sample properly the background source counts . in the selection of these off - positions",
    ", we implemented three criteria .",
    "first , in order to sample the stellar density gradient as a function of galactic latitude , we chose off - cloud positions at different heights above the galactic plane . next , we required that @xmath18 in the off - cloud regions , based on the optical extinction maps of cambrsy ( 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the off - cloud regions were required to have little or no molecular emission ( @xmath19co ) , based on the maps of dame et al .",
    "the off - cloud regions are mostly 15@xmath2015 . using a galactic model ( wainscoat et al .",
    "1992 ) , we have predicted the stellar background counts for each field ( table [ background_tab ] ) and have chosen the size of the off - cloud region so that we will detect at least 100 background stellar sources at 3.6 .",
    "the counts in these off - cloud regions are often much greater than 100 e.g. , at @xmath21 ( for serpens ) , we expect more than @xmath22 background stellar counts in the 15@xmath2015  region .",
    "the cloud maps will be made using slightly overlapping  frames and  scan legs .",
    "the  cloud maps will employ 2 dithers with an exposure time of 12 seconds in 2 epochs ( 24 sec total ) .",
    "since each cloud will be mapped twice , one map will be made in s high dynamic range mode ( hdr ) , which uses exposure times of 12 and 0.6 seconds , the shorter exposure time enabling photometry of bright point sources that might be saturated in the 12 second frames .",
    "isolated clouds will be observed with the same parameters as large cloud complexes ; expected sensitivities of the  molecular cloud observations are given in table [ senstab ] .",
    "the cloud area mapped with  will be at least 20% larger than that mapped by because of the efficiency of  scan mapping and the instrument - limited choice of scan lengths . using the  fast scan mode ,",
    "we will obtain 15 sec exposures at each epoch and achieve the sensitivities given in table [ senstab ] .",
    "observations of isolated clouds will be made in large - source photometry mode . at 24 @xmath12 m , an integration time of 3 sec ( for a total time , including 2 epochs , of 72 sec ) will be used . at 70 ,",
    "isolated clouds that contain no  sources , or  sources fainter than 2 jy at 60@xmath12 m will be observed in the large - source , coarse - scale mode , with an integration time of 3 sec ( for a total time , including 2 epochs , of 36 sec ) .",
    "clouds that contain  sources with @xmath23 jy , will be observed at 70  in the large - source super - resolution mode ( fine scale ) , with an integration time of 3 sec ( for a total time , including 2 epochs , of 48 seconds ) .",
    "the @xmath24 limits from table [ senstab ] for the scan maps yield a limit on  from 3.6 to 70  of about  at 350 pc .",
    "figure [ seds ] shows ( clockwise from upper left ) the survey detection limits against typical spectral energy distributions for a heavily embedded protostar , a less embedded protostar with a disk , a brown dwarf with a disk of 4.5 m@xmath25 , and an embedded brown dwarf .",
    "our simulations indicate that disks as small as 1 m@xmath26   could be detected , even when buried behind @xmath27 mag of extinction .",
    "the  bands would detect a 1 myr old , 5 m@xmath25  brown dwarf at 350 pc , based on models by burrows et al .",
    "the five large molecular complexes contain about 750 known stars and  point sources .",
    "based on recent estimates of the initial mass function in the field and in young clusters ( meyer et al .",
    "2000 , luhman et al .",
    "2000 ) , we expect to identify several thousand new substellar objects .",
    "these must be distinguished from a large number of background stars ( table [ background_tab ] ) and galaxies ( e.g. , lagache et al .",

    ", we are obtaining ancillary data at millimeter wavelengths , using  for those clouds accessible from the  ( perseus , ophiuchus , and serpens ) .",
    "in addition , we are obtaining complementary data for the southern clouds ( lupus and chamaeleon ) and isolated cores using the sest imaging bolometer array ( ) on the swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( ) . further complementary data on the northern clouds in molecular lines and dust extinction and emission are being obtained by the agoodman / research8.html ] team , who also plan to make the data public .",
    "complementary data on the isolated cores are also being taken with the submillimetre common user bolometer array ( ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( ) and  on the 30-m telescope of .",
    "complementary spectral line data to extend the cs 21 and n@xmath4h@xmath5 10 observations of lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and caselli et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are being obtained with the 32 element sequoia focal - plane array on the five college radio astronomy observatory ( fcrao ) 14-m telescope .",
    "these complementary data , which will be made available to the community through our c2d website , provide information on the existence and distribution of cloud material around objects detected at shorter wavelengths .",
    "such information will be valuable for establishing the association of specific sirtf sources with the cloud , for comparison of the material and stellar distributions , and for completing the overall picture of how star formation proceeds in clouds .",
    "complementary gas and dust observations on smaller scales are being acquired with the bima millimeter wavelength array .",
    "a mapping survey of 21 embedded cores , mostly in the perseus complex in the @xmath28 mm continuum and @xmath14co and c@xmath29o 10 lines , has been completed .",
    "the observed cores include well - known young embedded systems such as ngc 1333 iras4 , ngc 1333 iras7 , and b5 irs1 , as well as ammonia cores without known embedded sources .",
    "the maps have a resolution of 2  and a field of view of 100",
    ". this combination of resolution and field of view will allow detailed comparisons of the gas , dust , and irac - derived stellar distributions .",
    "the typical continuum sensitivity of 1 mjy / beam will permit detection of circumstellar disks down to a mass of 0.01 .",
    "the molecular data will also provide velocity structure information , which can be used to look at the correlation between turbulent / systematic velocity fields and stellar binarity and the stellar spatial distribution .",
    "in addition , as complementary data , the large clouds and many northern cores are being imaged at shorter ( r , i , and z ) wavelengths to limiting magnitudes of 24.5 , 22 , and 22 , respectively .",
    "the photometry at these wavelengths will be very valuable for identifying young objects , discriminating against background and foreground stars , and extending the coverage of the spectral energy distribution .",
    "extended objects will also be resolved , and young reflection nebulae and ( contaminating ) background galaxies will be identified .",
    "data will be obtained primarily with the cfh12k and megacam cameras at the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "southern targets ( such as chamaeleon ) will be imaged in similar bands with wfi at eso , la silla .",
    "disks around pre - main sequence stars are the likely sites of planet formation . as such , they have been targets of extensive research over the past two decades . surveys of continuum emission at infrared and millimeter wavelengths",
    "have established that 50% of all classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) ( ages @xmath30 3 myr ) have disks with typical masses of @xmath31 m@xmath32 , sufficient to form a planetary system like our own ( see beckwith & sargent 1996 , beckwith 1999 for reviews ) .",
    "disk sizes , as revealed by millimeter interferometry and  images , range from 100 to 1000 au in diameter .",
    "much less is known about the occurrence and properties of disks in later stages of evolution .",
    "evidence suggests that disk dispersal is marked by the termination of viscous accretion onto the star , dissipation of circumstellar gas , and the coagulation of grains into larger particles . during this process",
    ", disks are thought to evolve from an early opaque stage to one in which they are optically thin to both stellar radiation and their own thermal infrared emission .",
    "examples of such `` debris disks '' are found in association with nearby stars at ages up to about 1 gyr and contain relatively small amounts of dust ( less than a few lunar masses ) .",
    "analyses of timecales for grain dispersal have led to the conclusion that the dust is maintained by replenishment from asteroid collisions and cometary passages .",
    "the evolutionary transition between massive protoplanetary disks and tenuous debris disks appears to take place early in a star s life , perhaps within the first 10 myr ( strom et al .",
    "1989 ) . however , the timescales and synchronization of dispersal processes are largely unknown .",
    "unprecedented sensitivity at critical wavelengths will enable  to address key questions in the early evolution of circumstellar disks .",
    "weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts ) represent a strategically important sample for this purpose .",
    "these young pre - main sequence objects are characterized primarily by reduced signatures of protostellar accretion .",
    "in addition , they lack evidence for outflows and display diminished or absent near - infrared excess emission in contrast with their ctts counterparts . iras and iso detected far - infrared excesses in only a small fraction of wtts , but these early efforts lacked the sensitivity needed to detect the masses of material associated with nearby debris disks at the distances of the nearest star - forming clouds .",
    "consequently , it remains unclear whether wtts are the evolutionary descendants of classical t tauri stars or simply represent a population of stars _ without _ disks altogether .",
    "studies of the wtts population will bridge this gap in understanding and address the following key scientific questions :    \\1 . what is the frequency of debris disks in the low - mass stellar population at ages of less than 5 myr ?",
    "our program will establish the general presence or absence of disks in the wtts sample together with the evolutionary implications of either possibility .",
    "what timescale does the metamorphosis from primordial to debris disk occur ? by comparing ctts and wtts disk properties with those of the disks around young main - sequence stars in clusters , we can infer their evolutionary progress and synchronization .",
    "for example , grain - growth models predict a rapid transition from the opaque to translucent states , but the replenishment of small grains by planetesimal collisions may lead to a longer transition .",
    "the dispersion in disk properties within a coeval sample of stars will also provide a sensitive indicator of the diversity of evolutionary pathways for a forming planetary system .",
    "do most disks develop inner holes or gaps during the dissipation process ?",
    "this aspect of disk structural evolution is observable through the signature of the spectral energy distribution , and our observations will indicate whether disk dissipation and planetesimal formation proceeds at an equal pace throughout the disk , or at an accelerated pace in the inner disk region .",
    "the selection of wtts targets was driven by three considerations .",
    "first , targets were sought that were associated with the large molecular clouds being mapped .",
    "the proper motion dispersion for wtts at 140 pc distance is sufficient for the stars to move several degrees away from their natal clouds on a timescale of 10 myr ( hartmann et al .",
    "1991 ) , so targets were restricted to a zone within @xmath33 from the cloud boundaries .",
    "second , nearby wtts targets were chosen because they allow the best sensitivity to dust excess .",
    "for this reason , only targets associated with clouds closer than 160 pc were considered .",
    "third , we required that stars show evidence of young age : high levels of chromospheric activity as traced by x - ray emission detected by rosat , and strong li i 6707    absorption at levels exceeding those of pleiades stars of the same spectral type .",
    "on the basis of these criteria , we selected 190 targets associated with the chamaeleon , lupus , ophiuchus , and taurus clouds .",
    "these are distributed as follows : 30 stars from chamaeleon ( covino et al .",
    "1997 ) , 60 from lupus ( wichmann et al .",
    "1999 ) , 40 from ophiuchus ( martn et al .",
    "1998 ) , and 60 from taurus ( wichmann et al . 2000 ) .",
    "a few additional stars were selected from the catalog of herbig & bell ( 1988 ) .",
    "spectral types in the overall sample range from g5 to m5 .",
    "thirty of the targets fall within the boundaries of the large cloud maps , leaving 160 to be measured separately . with the observing strategy outlined below",
    ", these 160 targets require 50 hours .",
    "we will search for excess infrared emission in our wtts sample by means of photometric measurements at wavelengths of 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , and 70 @xmath12 m . at each target",
    ", single @xmath34 fields will be imaged with the irac and mips cameras .",
    "the irac observations consist of a single 0.6 second and two 12 second exposures .",
    "this sequence is designed to detect the stellar photospheres at s / n @xmath35 50 in all four irac bands . at 24 @xmath12 m",
    ", the mips observation strategy will detect the stellar photosphere at a s / n level of 20 .",
    "for the typical target , 2 photometry cycles with a 3 second exposure time are required to reach this sensitivity ; actual exposure time will be tailored to the expected photospheric brightness of each star . at 70 @xmath12 m , robust detection of a stellar photosphere",
    "would be prohibitively time - consuming and probably impossible due to cirrus and extragalactic confusion .",
    "consequently , we have aimed to achieve a more modest goal : s / n level greater than 5 for the detection of a @xmath36 pictoris - like debris disk characterized by a fractional luminosity of @xmath37 0.001 and 70 @xmath12 m flux density ten times the stellar photosphere . for the typical target ,",
    "2 photometry cycles with the 10 sec exposure time are needed to achieve this .",
    "as at 24 @xmath12 m , the planned exposure time is tailored to the brightness of the individual star .    the presence of infrared excess in an individal source can be readily determined by comparing its colors to those of  standard stars .",
    "to measure absolute levels of the excess , we will compare the observed flux densities to those of model photospheres appropriate to each object s spectral type , normalized to match available 2mass photometry .",
    "figure [ debris ] shows how the survey sensitivity compares to the emission from various stars surrounded by a debris disk .",
    "the survey will readily detect disks like that around @xmath36 pic , even if they have evacuated inner holes with radii as large as 30 au .",
    "disks an order of magnitude more tenuous will still be detected if their inner edge is at a radius of 5 au .",
    "fitting of model spectral energy distributions to the  measurements will allow the disk optical depth , inner radius , and radial density / temperature profiles to be constrained .",
    "two ground - based observing programs are being carried out in support of the c2d weak - line t tauri star study .",
    "the first is ancillary echelle spectroscopy using the 4-m telescopes at kpno and ctio .",
    "these spectra provide uniform measurements of spectral type , metallicity , lithium abundance , and chromospheric activity in the entire target sample , directly supporting the determinations of infrared excess and stellar age .",
    "the second is an adaptive optics ( ao ) search for source multiplicity using the eso adonis instrument ( hogerheijde et al .",
    "the presence of companion stars has been shown to have a strong effect on the frequency of circumstellar disks ( jensen , mathieu , and fuller 1996 ) ; by understanding multiplicity in our sample , its effect on the disk properties can be isolated .",
    "spectroscopy complements imaging and is essential to understand the physical and chemical state and evolution of gas and dust surrounding young stellar objects .",
    "the mid - infrared wavelength range encompassed by  is particularly rich in diagnostic features , each of which probes different aspects of the star- and planet - formation process ( see table [ tabspec ] ) .",
    "indeed , bands of solid - state material and the fundamental lines of the most abundant molecule , h@xmath4 , can be studied _ only _ in the mid - infrared . in the 75 hour c2d",
    "program , high signal - to - noise spectra will be obtained over the full 540 @xmath12 m range [ high resolution ( @xmath38 ) over the 1037  range ] for all phases of star- and planet - formation up to ages of @xmath375 myr for at least 170 sources .",
    "the mips - sed mode at 50100 @xmath12 m will also be used in the second year of the program to characterize the longer wavelength silicate and ice features of a disk sub - sample .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies , e.g. , with , only had the sensitivity to probe high- or intermediate - mass young stellar objects .  will permit the first comprehensive mid - infrared spectroscopic survey of solar - type young stars .",
    "the  spectra can be used to address the following questions :    \\1 .",
    "what do spectroscopic diagnostics tell us about the different stages of early stellar evolution ? as chronicled in table [ tabspec ] and figure [ irsfig ] , there are many mid - infrared spectroscopic features that are potentially diagnostic for distinct physical and chemical states of young circumstellar environments .",
    "a classification based on these features would complement the current classification scheme ( lada & wilking 1984 ) based on spectral energy distributions .",
    "prime diagnostics in the earliest embedded stages are the solid co@xmath4 bending mode at 15 @xmath12 m , the [ s i ] 25 @xmath12 m line and other atomic lines , the pah features , and the h@xmath4 lines .",
    "the shape of the 15 @xmath12 m solid co@xmath4 band seen in absorption toward protostars is particularly sensitive to the thermal history of the envelope , and changes in its profile have allowed young high - mass protostars to be put in an evolutionary sequence ( gerakines et al .",
    "the [ s i ] 25  and h@xmath4 lines probe the presence and properties of shocks , whereas the pah features signal the importance of ultraviolet radiation .",
    "together , they allow us to trace the relative importance of these two processes for clearing the envelope .",
    "a particularly exciting prospect is mid - infrared spectroscopy of disks as they are being unveiled .    in the later evolutionary stages , changes in silicate",
    "features become the main diagnostics . indeed , one of the major results from the sws instrument on  is that solid - state evolution of grain minerals occurs in disks around pre - main sequence stars ( meeus et al .",
    "some objects show only amorphous dust emission , whereas others have clear signatures of crystalline silicates and/or pahs .",
    "these variations may be related to the processes of grain coagulation , settling and destruction in the circumstellar disk , i.e. , its evolution .",
    "how does the chemical composition of dust and ices change from molecular clouds to planetary bodies ?",
    "in the embedded phase a reservoir of volatile and solid materials is delivered to the disk from the surrounding cloud core .",
    "the composition of the ices in the embedded phase can be probed by absorption spectroscopy , whereas that of the silicates in the pre - main sequence phase requires emission studies . the low  resolving power below 10 @xmath12 m",
    "does not allow detection of minor ice species , but the major ice components can be traced .",
    "many ices may survive the accretion shock and will be incorporated into icy grain mantles in the outer reaches of planetary systems , perhaps to be delivered to inner planets intact .",
    "indeed , remarkable similarities are found between the composition of interstellar ices and comets and between the crystalline silicates and pahs seen in some disks and those in comet hale - bopp ( malfait et al .",
    "an inventory of the material present at each stage of low - mass envelope and disk evolution as a function of stellar luminosity , mass , and environment will be a major goal of the spectroscopy program .",
    "the resulting spectra will form a powerful data base to compare with spectra of kuiper - belt objects , comets and asteroids obtained in other programs and to clarify the links between interstellar , circumstellar , and solar - system material .",
    "how does the size distribution of dust grains evolve in circumstellar environments ? observational and theoretical evidence points to a great deal of activity in dust grain evolution during the gas - rich disk phase , suggesting that grain growth to a km - sized population of planetesimals may occur at this stage .",
    "the silicate emission widely observed from gas - rich disks arises from small ( @xmath370.5 @xmath12 m ) grains , while the underlying continuum stems from larger particles .",
    "further , the overall excess shortward of 200 @xmath12 m scales approximately as the ratio of the disk ( dust ) photosphere to the gas scale height ( chiang et al .",
    "the low noise  spectra automatically cover the lowest pure rotational emission lines of h@xmath4 at 28 and 17 @xmath12 m , which may be detectable if the gas and dust temperatures are sufficiently different .",
    "successful detection of these lines would permit an independent assessment of the dust coagulation and gas dissipation time scales , processes of great importance for planet formation .",
    "it is important to note that the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) themselves do not give a unique answer to grain growth because of the degeneracy between disk mass and grain size distribution in radiative transfer models , especially if the physical size of the disk is uncertain ( chiang et al .",
    "however , the combination of seds with complementary spatially resolved infrared and millimeter - wave images of disks does resolve the parameter correlation , making it possible to constrain the relative settling of the dust versus the gas in gas - rich disks and the earliest stages of planetesimal formation up to roughly millimeter sizes .",
    "our c2d program will provide hundreds of objects for more detailed follow - up .",
    "what is the spectral evolution of substellar objects ?",
    "do they form as stars do , or do they form as companions to stars ?",
    "a clue that they form as stars do is the existence of a disk around many young substellar objects ( natta & testi 2001 ; apai et al .",
    "2002 ; liu et al .",
    "another important question is whether their atmospheres are dusty at later times .",
    "atmospheric spectra are predicted to show significant changes with age and mass ( e.g. , burrows et al .",
    "apart from limited photometry , nearly nothing is known observationally about the mid - infrared spectra of brown dwarfs , young or old .",
    "the young brown dwarfs and super - jupiters discovered in the irac and mips surveys ( @xmath37 100 expected ) therefore form a critical second look population for study with the .",
    "the  observations are divided into two sets with roughly equal time , the first being observations of known embedded and pre - main - sequence stars and the second consisting of follow - up spectroscopy of sources discovered in the irac and mips mapping surveys .",
    "the source list for the first - look program was restricted primarily to low - mass young stars , defined as having masses @xmath39 with ages younger than @xmath375 myr , for minimal overlap with existing infrared spectroscopy . within these criteria",
    "the selection contains a broad representative sample of young stars with ages down to 0.01 myr and masses down to the hydrogen burning limit or even less , if possible .",
    "figure [ irslum ] shows the distribution of sources over luminosity , and figure [ irsage ] shows the distribution over age .",
    "the initial selection of sources to be observed with the  was constrained to the cloud regions scheduled to be mapped by irac .",
    "a large list of class 0 , i and ii sources was compiled , primarily from the existing near- and mid - infrared surveys of the mapped clouds ( persi et al .",
    "2000 , bontemps et al .",
    "all overlaps with  high spectral resolution  targets were removed .",
    "the simbad database was searched for additional observations and modeling of every source remaining in the list .",
    "all available photometric points were collected and typical parameters such as bolometric luminosity , sed class , effective temperature , and optical extinction were entered into a concise database from which the final selection could be made .",
    "stars with no measured mid - infrared fluxes were dropped first . the availability of sensitive isocam surveys covering part of the mapped regions ensured that the fainter end of the luminosity function is well represented .",
    "most sources with @xmath40 fluxes less than @xmath41 were also discarded in the first look  sample due to time limitations ; some fainter sources of special interest , such as a few stars known to have an edge - on disk , were retained .",
    "stellar ages of the class ii sources were calculated by fitting the extinction - corrected temperature and bolometric luminosity from the database to the evolutionary tracks by siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , assuming solar abundances .",
    "stars with a calculated age of more than 5 myr were subsequently discarded since systems of this age and older are covered in the legacy spectrophotometry program , albeit largely at low spectral resolution .",
    "the flux limit to be achieved in the first - look survey corresponds to a typical source luminosity of @xmath42 and mass of @xmath43 in the ophiuchus , chameleon , serpens and lupus clouds at an age of 1 myr .",
    "care was taken at this point to verify that all stellar ages and masses within the limits of the full database were represented in the final sample . for completeness and comparison purposes ,",
    "a few sources were added such as background stars and certain herbig ae stars that were well characterized by the iso - sws .",
    "the final source list for the first - look survey consists of about 170 unique targets , of which about 10% belong to class 0 , 20% to class i and the rest to class ii .",
    "a roughly equal amount of time is reserved to the spectroscopic follow - up of interesting sources found in the imaging and photometry surveys , complementary mips - sed observations of selected first - look  sources , and spectral mapping of one cloud core .",
    "all first - look targets will be observed using the  staring mode in each of its four modules , except for those sources that are part of various  programs involving the low resolution modules . for those stars ,",
    "only the high resolution 10 - 37 @xmath12 m spectra will be acquired as part of the c2d   effort .",
    "whenever possible , cluster observations will be used to reduce the slewing and peak - up overheads .",
    "specifically , the moderate precision cluster mode will be used in conjunction with the blue filter on the peak - up array .",
    "the integration times for the short - high and long - high modules were fixed such that theoretical s / n ratios of at least 100 and 50 are obtained for sources brighter and fainter than @xmath44 , respectively . the spectra to be taken using",
    "the short - low modules always reach theoretical s / n ratios of @xmath35100 .",
    "in contrast to the scheduled  observations of large numbers of young stars , typically with the low resolution   modules , the c2d  program focuses on long integration times in the high resolution modules , ensuring high dynamic range even on weak sources .",
    "instrumental fringing may limit these s / n ratios , so the c2d  team is leading the development of defringing tools for , as described below . in order to evaluate the pointing performance of the spacecraft and assess the defringing software before beginning the full survey",
    ", the c2d validation program will include cluster mode observations of stars with widely varying brightness .",
    "while most of the objects will be observed in the  stare mode only , the northwestern serpens molecular core will be imaged over more than 4 square arcminutes to a @xmath45 sensitivity of 2 mjy using the low resolution  spectral mapping mode .",
    "this core contains several deeply - embedded sources and possesses a complex physical structure with infall , outflow , and formation of the envelope and disk all occurring within 30  to 60  ( @xmath46  pc ) of the central star . because the continuum is weak off - source , emission lines can be detected even at @xmath47 , and every  pixel may have an interesting spectrum , ranging from those characterized by deep ice absorption bands toward the protostars themselves to silicate emission from nearby disk sources or strong ionized lines at the heads of shocks . at some positions ,",
    "the `` continuum '' emission may even be entirely due to lines or pahs , which could significantly affect the interpretation and classification of objects .",
    "the targeted dynamic range of 50100 on the continuum in the stare observations is driven by the scientific questions outlined above , especially the desire to study the thermal history of the envelope through the 15 @xmath12 m co@xmath4 bending mode profiles and to search for gas phase emission and absorption features in all phases of star formation . even at @xmath48 , however , minor grain mantle components will be difficult to detect , and little or no kinematic information will be gleaned from the gas - phase lines .",
    "in addition , no information will be available on features shortward of 5 @xmath12 m .      as a complementary ground - based program ,",
    "we have therefore initiated flux - limited surveys in the atmospheric l - band and m - band windows using the vlt - isaac and keck nirspec ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 ) instruments in order to examine the fundamental stretching vibrations of the h@xmath4o and co molecules , respectively .",
    "the excellent sensitivity of these spectrometers has enabled the first high spectral resolution ( @xmath49 ) co observations of low - mass protostars , revealing both gaseous and solid co ( pontoppidan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "embedded sources in taurus and ophiuchus show a blend of gas - phase co absorption and emission profiles that are related to the simultaneous infall and outflow velocity fields in protostars ( see pontoppidan et al .",
    "studies of edge - on disk sources have been particularly revealing of the solid state components and velocity fields in accretion disk surface layers and mid - plane ( boogert , hogerheijde , & blake 2002 , thi et al .",
    "2002 ) . in older class ii disk systems ,",
    "particularly herbig ae stars , emission from co and atomic hydrogen lines is observed and likely arises from the inner disk in or near the dust sublimation radius ( see also dullemond et al .",
    "2001 , brittain & rettig 2002 ) .",
    "a subset of irs targets with known infrared ice absorption features is being characterized , using the cso and ovro facilities .",
    "observations of c@xmath29o  and hco@xmath5  lines as well as millimeter continuum emission are used to derive the distribution and physical conditions ( temperature , density , and column density ) of material along the line of sight .",
    "this information is crucial in locating the ices and understanding ice evolution indicators ( ice column , absorption band profile ) , as well as in properly interpreting the spectral energy distribution ( boogert et al .",

    "the c2d-  team will enhance the  pipeline data delivered by the  in several ways .",
    "the most important improvement will be in the defringing of the irs spectra , because laboratory experiments indeed show the presence of fringes .",
    "special software derived from the iso - sws experience is being written for defringing both 1-d and 2-d spectra ( lahuis & boogert 2002 ) .",
    "the in - flight fringe characteristics ( complexity and amplitude ) are presently unknown , however , which is one of the reasons why two independent defringing approaches , each with its own merits , are being exploited .",
    "the first uses a robust method of iteratively fitting sine functions ; the second algorithm minimizes fringe residuals by correcting the flat field to best match the data . in parallel , a `` complete '' fringe model is being developed , applying basic optical theory and incorporating the geometry and optical properties of the  detectors .",

    "<S> spectroscopy with  of new objects found in the surveys and of a select group of known objects will add vital information on the changing chemical and physical conditions in the disks and envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting data products will include catalogs of thousands of previously unknown sources , multiwavelength maps of about 20 square degrees of molecular clouds , photometry of about 190 known young stars , spectra of at least 170 sources , ancillary data from ground - based telescopes , and new tools for analysis and modeling . </S>",
    "<S> these products will constitute the foundations for many follow - up studies with ground - based telescopes , as well as with  itself and other space missions such as , , , and . </S>"
