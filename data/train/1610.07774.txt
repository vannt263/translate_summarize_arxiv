    "collective cell movement depends on intracellular biological mechanisms as well as environmental cues due to the extracellular matrix ( ecm)@xcite , mainly composed by collagen which is organized in hierarchical structures , such as fibrils and fibers .",
    "the mechanical properties of collagen fibril networks are essential to offer little resistance and high sensitivity to small deformations , allowing easy local remodeling and strong strain stiffening needed to ensure cell and tissue integrity @xcite .",
    "wound healing is a typical biological assay to study collective migration of cells under controlled conditions _ in vitro _ and is a prototypical experimental method to study active matter @xcite .",
    "experiments performed on soluble collagen @xcite or other gels @xcite , micro - patterned @xcite and deformable substrates @xcite show that cell migration is guided by the substrate structure and stiffness @xcite .    it has been argued that collective migration properties arise from stresses transmitted between neighboring cells @xcite giving rise to long - ranged stress waves in the monolayer @xcite . hence the dynamics of an invading cell sheet is ruled by a combination of long - range internal stresses and interactions with the substrate , suggesting an analogy with driven elastic systems moving in a disordered medium such as cracks lines @xcite , imbibition fronts @xcite or ferromagnetic domain walls @xcite .",
    "the scaling laws in these systems are usually associated with a depinning critical point that has been widely studied by simple models for interface dynamics .",
    "thanks to a combination of numerical simulations @xcite and renormalization group theory @xcite , we now have a detailed picture of the non - equilibrium phase transitions and universality classes in these systems . here",
    "we substantiate the analogy between collective cell migration and depinning by revealing and characterizing widely distributed bursts of activity in the collective migration of different types cells ( human cancer cells and epithelial cells , mouse endothelial cells ) over different substrates ( plastic , soluble and fibrillar collagen ) and experimental conditions ( ve - cadherin knock down ) and compare the experiments with simulations of a computational model of active particles @xcite .",
    "we find that in all these cases the statistical properties of the bursts follow universal scaling laws that are quantitatively similar to those observed in driven disordered systems @xcite .",
    "we perform migration experiments on different cell lines as described in the materials and methods section .",
    "we extract and record the cell front position as a function of time as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for experiments ( see videos s1-s7 ) and in simulations ( video s8 ) .",
    "the fronts show a rough structure with localized bursts of activity that is reminiscent of elastic lines moving in a pinning landscape @xcite .",
    "spatio - temporal velocity fluctuations in moving fronts can be effectively quantified by constructing activity maps , as done previously for moving crack fronts @xcite and fluid imbibition through porous media @xcite . as discussed in the materials and methods section , from each time - lapse movie",
    "we construct a spatial map @xmath0 measuring the velocity of the front at position @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "s1 ) . using these maps we can define regions of coordinated activity by introducing a threshold @xmath2 for the velocity .",
    "the maps reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] vividly illustrate the formation of localized clusters of activity similar to those found in fracture @xcite and imbibition @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distributions of cluster areas are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a for experiments on different cell types and for simulations .",
    "they all display a power law decay @xmath3 up to a cutoff length @xmath4 .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 of the power law distribution appears to be similar for different cell types : the fitted values ( see table s1 ) are all similar within error bars ( @xmath6 ) and remarkably close to the values recorded in crack front propagation @xcite . as observed in moving cracks fronts , the cluster distributions , and in particular the cutoff to the power law decay ,",
    "depends on the threshold @xmath2 used to identify the activity ( see materials and methods and fig .",
    "s1).the value of the cutoff @xmath4 is in all cases much larger than the typical size of a cell indicating that correlated activity spans multiple cells ( fig .",
    "we also provide additional evidence for universality by measuring the relation between width , length and size of clusters fig .",
    "[ fig:2]cd . also in this case",
    ", we find robust scaling across different cell lines and experimental conditions .      to study quantitatively the effect of the substrate on the migration capability of cancer cells , we study wound healing under three different cell coating conditions : plastic ( i. e. no coating ) , bovine soluble and fibrillar collagen .",
    "the two types of collagen substrates are exactly the same in terms of biochemistry , but differ in the structural organization . in fig .",
    "s3 , we show the fibrillar organization of our collagen substrate by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) , while soluble collagen substrates display no fibrils or structure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b , the exponent of the activity cluster distribution is independent on the substrate .",
    "the average cluster size , however , is larger for fibrillar collagen than for soluble collagen and plastic , independently on the value of @xmath2 ( see fig [ fig:2]b and fig .",
    "s4a ) to further quantify the role of the substrate in front propagation , we record average position of front as a function of time . as shown fig .",
    "s5a , cell front motion is significantly slower on plastic substrates than on collagen ones . there is no noticeable difference in the average velocity of fronts moving on soluble and fibrillar collagen substrates .",
    "fluctuations do , however , differ as shown by the standard deviation of the front position that is larger for cells moving on fibrillar collagen substrates ( fig s5b )      to better quantify the properties of the different experimental conditions , we resort to particle image velocimetry ( piv , see materials and methods ) which allows to estimate local velocities treating the cell layer as a fluid .",
    "representative examples of the local velocities for different cell types and for simulations are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]a which displays the orientation of the velocity field ( see also videos s1-s7 ) . while cells mostly advance towards the empty space there is significant motion also in the transverse and even in the opposite direction .",
    "this is summarized in the orientation distribution , revealing small differences due to cell types and substrates ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3]de and s5c ) .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]b and s5d we report the distribution of the absolute value of the velocities extracted from piv , indicating again quantitative differences between different cell types and substrates . yet",
    ", the general shape of the velocity distribution is similar in all cases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3]c where the velocities for each experiment are rescaled by their average value .",
    "this leads to a collapse of all the distributions , including the results of numerical simulations , apart from small deviations in the tails .",
    "internal couplings usually play a key role in avalanche statistics @xcite . to understand this point in our context",
    ", we assess the role of cell - cell interactions performing the same cell migration assay knocking down ve - cadherin in mouse endothelial cells @xcite .",
    "ve - cadherin is an endothelial specific cadherin molecule located at adherent junctions which regulats adhesion between adjacent endothelial cells .",
    "here we consider cells without ve - cadherin ( vec - null ) but still expressing n - cadherin , another important molecule expressed by several types of cells such as neuronal , skeletal and heart muscle cells or fibroblasts @xcite .",
    "moreover , n - cadherin is highly expressed in mesenchymal stem cells and cancer cells that are highly invasive and poorly polarized @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a , vec - null cell fronts move faster , but in a more disordered way ( see fig .",
    "s6 ) , than vec - positive fronts .",
    "the distribution of activity cluster areas is very similar in the two cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]a ) , with slightly larger cutoff size for vec - positive cells ( see fig .",
    "s2 ) . despite these similarities ,",
    "vec - null cells tend to detach from the advancing front and move forward ( see video s9 ) .",
    "we have tracked the trajectories of individual cells ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]c ) and shown that they follow a persistent random walk , displaying ballistic motion at short time - scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4]d ) .",
    "the combination of faster fronts and individual cells detachment confirms a more invasive phenotype for vec - null cells @xcite .      in order to better understand how avalanche - like fluctuations arise in collective cell migration",
    ", we simulate the model of interacting active particle introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for the details see the materials and methods section ) .",
    "the geometry of the system , the size and number of particles are chosen to match the experimental images .",
    "particles are first packed into a confined space and then allowed to invade space filled with `` surface '' particles . for the time",
    "scales considered in the present experiments , cell division is negligible and therefore we do not consider it in the model .",
    "the main tuning parameters of the model are the inter - particle velocity coupling @xmath7 , the amplitude of the noise @xmath8 and the adhesion strength @xmath9 .",
    "we also take into account the rough structure of the fibrillar collagen substrate by including a quenched ( i.e. time independent ) random force field with amplitude @xmath10 and correlation length @xmath11 .",
    "simulations representing plastic or soluble collagen substrate are performed without quenched disorder ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , with fluctuations arising only from the random initial condition and the time - dependent noise in the dynamics .",
    "in addition to the random force field , the main difference between our simulations and ref .",
    "@xcite is that we do not consider leader cells .",
    "the numerical simulations allow to reproduce with good accuracy all the salient features of collective cell migration revealed by our experiments as reported in figs .",
    "[ fig:1]-[fig:3 ] .",
    "as already discussed , the numerical simulations reproduce the statistical features of activity bursts ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) and cell velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the numerical results illustrate the key role played by the substrate disorder , encoded in its correlation length @xmath11 , in determining the cutoff scale of the cluster size distribution ( see fig .",
    "s7 ) . in particular",
    ", higher values of @xmath11 correspond to larger activity clusters .",
    "this explains why cells move in larger activity bursts on fibrillar substrates , where disorder is stronger .",
    "decreasing the velocity coupling @xmath7 or the adhesion strength @xmath9 increases the front velocity ( fig .",
    "s8 ) which should be compared with an analogous result observed when ve - cadherin is knocked down ( fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) . the model allows to explore the limits of universality .",
    "we observe an activity cluster distribution comparable to the experimentally measured one only for relatively small values of @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath7 is larger ( e.g. @xmath13 ) the exponent @xmath5 is significantly smaller , suggesting the presence of different universality classes ( see fig .",
    "s7 and table s2 for the results of the fits ) .",
    "finally , we assess the relevance of interactions ( i.e. performing simulations with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and pinning ( i.e. no surface particles and no random field ) and find that when either one of the two ingredients is missing the distribution is not a power law anymore ( see fig .",
    "when neither pinning and interactions are present , we can not record a well defined front .",
    "the combinations of experimental results and numerical simulations suggests that the activity bursts observed in collective cell migration could be described by universal scaling laws as in non - equilibrium critical phenomena . in order to strengthen this conclusion",
    "it is , however , imperative to overcome the limitations of power law fitting @xcite and focus instead on scaling functions , as indicated by sethna et al .",
    "@xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in proximity of a depinning critical point , avalanche distributions @xmath16 can be written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a universal scaling function . here",
    ", we follow the same approach with our data and show that indeed all the experimental distributions , involving different cell lines and substrate , and those obtained from numerical simulations collapse into a single universal scaling curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we thus perform a joint fit of all the distributions with a single scaling function @xmath20 , yielding @xmath21 as best fitting parameter .",
    "this result provides a strong test of the universality of the bursty behavior we observe in collective cell migration .",
    "the collective motion of a cell layer as it invades an empty region has been extensively studied experimentally @xcite but the relation with the glassy features observed in confluent layers @xcite was not explored .",
    "the externally driven motion of disordered and glassy systems typically involves intermittent behavior and avalanches @xcite .",
    "our work shows that collective bursts of activity are also present in active matter with cells advancing in avalanches of widely distributed sizes .",
    "similar intermittent activity @xcite and scaling behavior has been previously recorded in animal @xcite and even human mobility patterns @xcite and it is thus intriguing to realize that it exists even at the cellular level . finally , migration is a key property of tumor cells for tissue invasion and metastasis .",
    "our detailed statistical analysis shows quantitatively how the organization and structure of the substrate , either gel or fibrillar , affects the way cells move .",
    "the final invasion velocity is the same but the motion is different , with larger intermittent fluctuations present on fibrillar substrates .",
    "this finding is interesting since it implies that cancer cells use different internal mechanisms to migrate depending on the environment , a fact that should be relevant for the metastatic process .",
    "collagen substrates are prepared from a 3% solution of soluble bovine collagen in 0.01 hcl ( code c4243 , sigma ) , kept in ice until use .",
