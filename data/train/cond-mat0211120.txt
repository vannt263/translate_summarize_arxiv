    "since their discovery @xcite , carbon nanotubes have provided a testbed for fundamental and applied physics .",
    "characterization of these new systems is crucial for future progress .",
    "the thermopower of a material is an intrinsic quantity which yields important information related to the electronic band structure , electron - phonon coupling parameters , and relaxation rates of the system .",
    "recent experiments on mats of single walled carbon nanotubes @xcite have found surprisingly large values for the thermoelectric power ( @xmath0 ) under various ambient conditions .",
    "when the thermopower is plotted versus temperature most of the data show a quasi - linear behavior at temperatures greater than 200k .",
    "thermopower linear in temperature suggests that conduction through metallic tubes dominates the thermopower at these temperatures .",
    "however , some data show nonlinearities below @xmath1 . here a peak in the thermopower is observed .",
    "the origin of this peak is the subject of much debate .",
    "several effects that could lead to such behavior have been discussed in the literature .",
    "these include parallel transport through semiconducting tubes @xcite , a one - dimensional kondo effect @xcite , and the phonon drag effect .",
    "semiconducting tubes are not expected to contribute much to the thermopower because metallic tubes have a larger electrical conductivity @xcite .",
    "the kondo effect has been invoked to explain the large peak in samples containing magnetic impurities . however , a smaller , broad peak remains when the magnetic impurities are removed and therefore does not explain the universality of the low temperature nonlinearity in samples without magnetic impurities .    turning to the phonon drag effect",
    ", very little theoretical work has been done to calculate the phonon drag contribution to the thermopower in metallic carbon nanotubes .",
    "rough , low temperature , estimates often quote the result @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the lattice specific heat . however , this formula assumes that phonons scatter electrons within one parabolic band and that electron - phonon scattering acts as the dominant phonon decay mechanism .",
    "applying eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) to nanotubes with two bands , particle and hole , yields a negligible contribution to the thermopower due to drag because the particle and hole contributions cancel .",
    "the objective of this work is to extract the temperature dependence of the phonon drag contribution to the thermopower for a one dimensional system , within the linear band approximation .",
    "we consider a model wherein mechanisms other than electron - phonon scattering limit phonon lifetimes .",
    "we derive a new expression for the phonon drag in these systems using a solution of the coupled electron - phonon boltzmann equations .",
    "we find that _ inter_band scattering gives a non - zero contribution to the thermopower when the fermi level does _ not _ lie at the band crossing .",
    "interband transitions near the fermi level contribute appreciably to the phonon drag thermopower .",
    "our results can be summarized in the following formula @xmath4 in the limit @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are fitting parameters , @xmath8 is the energy difference between the fermi level and the band crossing , @xmath9 the electron speed , @xmath10 a typical phonon speed , and @xmath11 the debye temperature .",
    "@xmath12 parameterizes the temperature dependence of the phonon relaxation time . in metals one typically finds @xmath13 at temperatures near the debye temperature .",
    "the term linear in temperature is the usual diffusive contribution for metals and the second term is our result for the phonon drag part at low temperatures .",
    "this formula yields a peak , due to phonon drag .",
    "we therefore associate the phonon drag effect with the low temperature nonlinearities observed in thermopower measurements on single walled carbon nanotubes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we outline the basic theory of thermopower measurements in metals . in section iii",
    "bailyn s theory of phonon drag in metals is reviewed . in section",
    "iv we apply bailyn s theory to a simple 1-d model of single walled , ( 10,10 ) armchair carbon nanotubes . here",
    "we derive an expression for the phonon drag in these systems . in section v we extract a simple formula by making a low temperature approximation . in section",
    "vi we conclude by discussing the limits of our approximations .",
    "the application of a temperature gradient to a metal leads to the diffusion of charge carriers from the warm to the cold end of the sample .",
    "the thermopower measures the charge build up across the sample .",
    "it is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the potential and temperature differences across the sample , respectively .",
    "the thermopower due to diffusion , @xmath17 , can be calculated from the standard set of transport coefficients .",
    "the transport coefficients can in turn be derived from the boltzmann equation for the electron distribution function .",
    "a general argument leads to the mott expression for the thermopower due to diffusion @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy , @xmath20 the electrical conductivity , and @xmath21 the fermi energy . when there is more than one band present the thermopower due to each band adds @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the band index .",
    "we apply the above equations to the case of metallic carbon nanotubes by considering electrons in one dimension .",
    "the electronic states fill two overlapping , parabolic bands , the particle and hole bands , up to the fermi level . with only one parabolic band",
    "we expect the diffusive part of the thermopower in a metal to vary linearly with temperature .",
    "the factor @xmath24 depends on the details of the system , including the density of states .",
    "however , with two bands present , the thermopower due to states filling the hole band cancels the contribution from the particle band when the fermi level lies at the band crossing . within this approximation",
    "we have no net contribution to the thermopower in a metallic tube .    when the fermi level is allowed to move within the rigid @xmath25 bands the resulting thermopower is non - zero @xcite .",
    "recent calculations show that an enhancement in the density of states due to impurities @xcite or tube - tube interactions @xcite may generate large contributions to the thermopower through the term @xmath24 .",
    "we therefore consider the following standard form for the diffusive contribution to the thermopower in metals @xmath26 where the constant @xmath6 is a fitting parameter which may vary with the fermi level .",
    "recent experiments on mats of single walled , carbon nanotube bundles do indeed show this behavior at large temperatures ( @xmath27 ) @xcite .",
    "an anomalous peak in the thermopower appears at low temperatures in several different experiments on single - walled and multi - walled carbon nanotubes . in standard thermopower measurements of 3-d metals such behavior",
    "is often associated with the phonon drag effect whereby the phonon flux from the hot end of the sample to the cold end drags additional charge carriers to the cold end of the sample via momentum transfer .",
    "this effect adds to the thermopower in conventional metals @xmath28",
    "standard , low temperature estimates of the phonon drag contribution to the thermopower rely on the relation @xmath29 where @xmath3 is the lattice specific heat , @xmath30 the carrier density , and the @xmath31 is the transfer factor .",
    "@xmath31 is a rough estimate of the probability that a phonon collides with an electron relative to all scattering events . in one dimension",
    "the lattice specific heat is nearly linear in temperature @xcite and does not provide the nonlinear temperature dependence required to explain the peak observed in measurements on carbon nanotubes @xcite . moreover , if we consider only intraband scattering , the contributions from states filling the electron and hole bands should cancel to give no net drag .",
    "the above formula for the drag contribution can not be applied to metallic carbon nanotubes for two reasons .",
    "the derivation of the above formula @xcite relies on a free , electronic band structure where transitions lie only within the parabolic bands .",
    "it also assumes that the dominant decay mechanism for phonons is electron - phonon scattering .",
    "below we derive a new formula for the low temperature phonon drag contribution to the thermopower in one dimension .",
    "we find a nonzero contribution to the phonon drag part of the thermopower when we include transitions between two linear bands and assume that the dominant decay mechanism for phonons is _ not _ electron - phonon scattering .",
    "the phonon drag contribution to the thermopower in a metal may be calculated by solving the coupled electron - phonon boltzmann equations . in this section",
    "we briefly review bailyn s formalism for calculating the phonon drag . following ref .",
