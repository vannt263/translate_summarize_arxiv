    ", such as the polarizability , in the njl model",
    ".    there are two important features in our study which have not been considered in earlier works in soliton models : 1 )  the role of the dirac sea effects ( this can only be done in a model which has the dirac sea , such as the njl model ) , and 2 )  inclusion of rotational @xmath1-effects .",

    "we find that the effects of the dirac sea in our calculation of @xmath4 are very well reproduced by the first two terms in the gradient expansion , where the first term is the so called `` seagull '' contribution to @xmath4 , discussed in many previous papers @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates explicitly that the inclusion of the sea - gull in the @xmath7-model or in the skyrme model does not violate gauge invariance , as has recently been claimed in ref .",
    "this is readily seen from the full njl expression , which is purely _ dispersive _ in character ( _ i.e. _ involves no seagull terms ) and manifestly gauge invariant . the seagull term emerges from the full expression when the gradient expansion is performed ( see sec .  [ se : leading ] ) .",

    "it may be immediately verified that both the valence and sea contributions to @xmath68 scale as @xmath0 @xcite .    in the njl model ,",
    "predictions depending on the cut - off are somewhat ambiguous .",
    "as we shall see , however , in our case @xmath82 is dominated by the lowest term in the gradient expansion , which is independent of the cut - off .",
    "the numerical results for the valence , @xmath83 , and dirac sea , @xmath82 , parts of @xmath68 are plotted in fig .  1 as a function of the constituent quark mass @xmath22",
    ". both contributions decrease with increasing @xmath22 , the valence curve has much larger slope for smaller @xmath22 due to the fast increasing energy gap between the valence orbital and the positive continuum . for the optimum value @xcite of @xmath84 , we obtain .",
    "the sea contributes to @xmath68 65% , and dominates over the valence part , which gives 35% .",
    "since the dirac sea effects describe the physics of the pion cloud , this result is in qualitative agreement with the results of other models @xcite .",
    "we have also performed the gradient expansion of @xmath82 up to first two terms following the scheme of refs .",
    "this provides a link to the @xmath7-model @xcite as well as an independent check for our numerical procedure in the case of large size solitons .",
    "the leading - order term in the gradient expansion of @xmath82 gives us exactly the _ seagull _ term of the @xmath7-model @xmath85 note that this seagull term arises in the njl model from _ purely dispersive _ dirac sea effects ( _ cf . _",
    "( [ sea ] ) ) .",
    "recently , the inclusion of the seagull term in soliton models such as the @xmath7-model or the skyrmion has been questioned @xcite .",

    "numerically the seagull term gives more than 80% of the total sea contribution .",
    "looking at absolute numbers it may seem striking that our value of the seagull contribution , @xmath86 , and the @xmath7-model @xcite value , @xmath87 differ so drastically .",
    "the explanation lies in the large difference in the values of the axial coupling constant at the leading @xmath0 level .",
    "our model predicts @xmath88 , while in the @xmath7-model @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic pion tail , which gives the dominant contribution in ( [ seagull ] ) , is proportional to @xmath90 and since the pion field enters quadratically in ( [ seagull ] ) the large effect follows .",
    "we will come back to the question of @xmath6 in the next section .",
    "it is interesting to investigate in some greater detail how well the gradient expansion works for the electric polarizability . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the results of the gradient expansion with the full calculation of @xmath82 for large - size solitons parameterized by the profile function involving a size parameter @xmath91 @xmath92 with increasing size of the soliton the result of the gradient expansion for @xmath82 up to first two terms converges to the full result very well . at @xmath93  fm the difference is only 2% .",
    "even the leading order of the gradient expansion , @xmath94 , shows good agreement with the full result , reproducing it up to 90% at @xmath93  fm .",
    "now we turn to the problem of the next - to - leading order corrections in the @xmath1 expansion of the electric polarizability @xmath4 .",
    "as already mentioned above , the value of @xmath6 in chiral soliton models is crucial for the results for @xmath4 .",
    "the prediction for @xmath6 in the njl model ( as well as in the skyrme model ) at the leading-@xmath0 level , denoted by @xmath90 , turns out to be much too small , @xmath95 @xcite , and no parameter fits or extensions of the model were able to raise this value .",
    "recently , ref .",
    "@xcite proposed how to include rotational @xmath1 corrections to @xmath6 in the njl model .",
    "a correct and detailed study of this effect has been presented in refs .",
    "the nature of these corrections is very easy to understand , for instance from the point of view of the formalism of ref .  @xcite . at the leading-@xmath0 level",
    "the expression for @xmath6 involves a sum of matrix elements of the axial operator in the quark single - particle states  @xcite",
    ". however , in the presence of cranking the hedgehog state is perturbed , and we have a situation where one of the perturbations is the axial vector current , and the other one is the cranking . the effect discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite is associated with the noncommutativity of the collective parts of the corresponding operators ( the cranking and the axial vector current operators in this case ) .",
    "an analogous effect arises for the case of @xmath4 , as we discuss below .    since the cranking operator scales as @xmath1 ( it involves the cranking frequency @xmath69 )",
    "the correction is suppressed by one power of @xmath0 .",
    "this correction to the axial vector coupling constant , denoted by @xmath96 , has the valence part and the sea part .",
    "the numerical value for @xmath96 is about @xmath97 @xcite , and raises the total value of @xmath6 to a comfortable number . of course , the described @xmath1 corrections are not the only possible ones , but they seem to be particularly important .    we have explained before that the small value of @xmath90 reduces the value of the seagull contribution to the polarizability , which is a desired effect . since roatational @xmath1 corrections raise significantly the value of @xmath6 , we have also to examine how analogous effects influence the electric polarizability .",
    "the @xmath1 rotational corrections to @xmath4 are obtained by expanding the effective action  ( [ cranked ] ) to second order in @xmath73 and first order in @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we have formally the case of the third - order perturbation theory .",
    "we get expression of the generic form ( [ eq : kappan ] ) , with all possible time - orderings of collective operators .    the relevant collective matrix elements for the present case have the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the moment of inertia . finally ,",

    "our results are shown in fig .  1 .",

    "the decrease of @xmath107 with increasing @xmath22 is similar to the behavior of the leading-@xmath0 valence contribution @xmath83 .",
    "now we turn to the sea contribution @xmath109 .",
    "this contribution in principle may involve a cut - off , similar to other observables calculated in the njl model .",

    "this is due to the decrease of the moment of inertia with @xmath22 . guided by our experience from gradient - expanding the leading-@xmath0 contribution ( sec .",

    "we would like to present an interesting observation .",
    "the formula analogous to eq .",
