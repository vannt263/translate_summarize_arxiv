    "recent years , in some results from lattice qcd @xcite , it seems the qcd phase could be changed by a strong magnetic field . by the analysis of some thermodynamic observables ,",
    "it has been found the critical temperature of the crossover region should fall when the magnetic field increases @xcite .",
    "it implies the confinement / deconfinement phase transition or the chiral phase transition @xcite would tend to be induced by a strong magnetic field . with the mit bag model , this result could be reproduced qualitatively @xcite , reflecting the great significance of quark confinement .",
    "furthermore , the approach of large-@xmath0 qcd has already been considered in @xcite . from the analysis of the flavor correction @xmath1 to the pressure , this effect has also been obtained due to the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "on the other hand , gauge / gravity duality or ads / cft has become a framework to understand non - perturbative aspects of strong - coupled quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "motivated by these , we would like to investigate the thermodynamics of the quarks and gluons by using the famous top - down holographic model i.e. the witten - sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , in the presence of a magnetic field with the dynamical flavors . by the underlying string theory ,",
    "this model describes a non - supersymmetric and non - conformal yang - mills theory in 3 + 1 dimension coupled to @xmath2 chiral massless fermions ( quarks ) and adjoint massive matter , as a low energy effective theory . in the original witten - sakai - sugimoto model ,",
    "there are @xmath0 d4-branes compactified on a circle representing the dynamics of gluons , @xmath2 species of massless quarks introduced by putting in @xmath2 pairs of d8 and anti d8-branes ( @xmath3-branes ) . by taking the large @xmath0 limit i.e. @xmath4",
    ", these @xmath0 d4-branes produce a 10d background geometry described by type iia supergravity while the @xmath2 @xmath5-branes are as probes .",
    "accordingly , the fundamental quarks do not have dynamical degrees of freedoms thus are quenched . in order to take into account the dynamics of the fundamental matter and compare it with the results from lattice",
    "qcd , we construct the gravitational solutions by considering the backreaction from the flavor branes with turning on a background magnetic field , at leading order of the veneziano limit .",
    "it means the gravitational solution , as an explicit description of the dual field theory , takes the limit of large number of colors and flavors i.e. @xmath6 , but with fixed @xmath1 , at leading order of the small @xmath1 expansion .",
    "we study the model both in confined and deconfined geometry by re - solving the full action ( bulk fields plus flavor branes ) i.e. taking into account the backreaction from the flavor branes and the magnetic field . and",
    "it also turns out that our solutions describe the configuration with an abelian group as chiral symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the description of deconfinement transition and chiral transition in the witten - sakai - sugimoto model was proposed in @xcite . at zero temperature ,",
    "the bubble ( confined ) solution of the @xmath0 d4-branes is dominant , corresponding the confinement phase in the dual field theory , while the black brane ( deconfined ) solution of the @xmath0 d4-branes arises as the deconfinement phase at high temperature .",
    "thus the phase transition between confinement and deconfinement can be identified as the hawking - page transition between two different background geometries .",
    "we can therefore evaluate the critical temperature by the analysis of the pressure in bubble and black brane background .",
    "the result shows that a confinement / deconfinement transition at @xmath7 arises , where @xmath8 is a mass scale of the mass spectrum .",
    "however , while the bubble solution can be connected to the confinement phase of the dual field theory , this is less clear for the black brane solution because of the mismatched value of the polyakov loops @xcite , which thus makes `` the black d4-brane solution corresponding the deconfinement phase '' may not be strictly rigorous .",
    "nevertheless , we can focus on the chiral transition since the embedded flavor branes take connected / parallel configuration in the bubble / black d4-brane solution respectively , which corresponds to the chirally broken / symmetric phase in the dual field theory . on the other hand ( as we can see in @xcite ) , because of no contributions from the flavors , a constant and flavor - independently critical temperature @xmath9 might be unrealistic .",
    "so in these senses , we would like to study the hawking - page transition of this holographic system by taking into account the backreaction of flavor and the magnetic field , then we are able to compare the resultantly holographic phase diagram with lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "there have been some present works to study the thermodynamics of the quarks and gluons in the presence of a magnetic field by using this model @xcite .",
    "however most of them are discussed in the probe flavor limit .",
    "thanks to the techniques proposed in @xcite and especially used in @xcite , it allows us to consider the backreaction from the flavors in this model corresponding to study the hawking - page transition with flavor and color branes . by employing these techniques , we would like to make some improvements to @xcite with the backreaction from the flavor branes and it could also be treated as a parallel computation to @xcite .",
    "let us outline some technical details in our manuscript .",
    "first , we use the smearing technique @xcite for the flavor branes to construct gravitational solutions as @xcite but in the presence of a magnetic field ( and with zero chemical potential ) .",
    "then in order to preserve the isometries of the original background , we also homogeneously smear a large number @xmath2 of d8-branes on the @xmath10 circle where the @xmath0 d4-branes are wrapped .",
    "as it will be seen , while this configuration simplifies the calculations greatly , we have to solve a set of coupled second order equations of motion of this system . because of the presence of the magnetic field , these equations of motion are all highly non - linear , which are still extremely complicated to solve",
    ". hence we focus on solving these equations in the limit of small magnetic field and small flavor backreaction since it admits analytically magnetic - dependent solutions . and to determine the integration constants in our solution , we furthermore require that the backgrounds must be completely regular in the ir region of the dual field theory . with the presence of the magnetic field , the integration constants could be able to depend on the constant magnetic field .",
    "however , we find it is not enough to determine all the integration constants just by this requirement .",
    "besides , in the uv region , there also is an non - removable divergence unaffected by the presence of the magnetic field , which is due to the landau pole in field theory , reflecting in the running coupling holographically .",
    "last but not least , since the onshell action evaluated by our gravitational solutions is divergent , we need to holographically renormalize the theory in order to study its thermodynamics .",
    "the holographic renormalization of this famous witten - sakai - sugimoto model has been studied with dynamical flavors in a covariant way @xcite ( also see @xcite in the presence of a magnetic field with the approach of probe flavor brane ) .",
    "accordingly , we combine the viewpoints in @xcite to study the holographic renormalization of this model with dynamical flavors and the magnetic field . as the result",
    ", we find if the parameters in the covariant counterterms ( proposed in @xcite ) depend on the magnetic field , they are enough to cancel all the divergences in our calculations . in our probe approximation",
    "the resultantly renormalized pressure is in agreement with @xcite and we can obtain the phase diagram by comparing the confined / deconfined pressure .",
    "our holographic phase diagram shows , the critical temperature decreases when the magnetic field increases , which qualitatively agrees with the lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "consequently this approach is interesting and could be treated as an improvement to @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section 2",
    ", we will give a brief review of the witten - sakai - sugimoto model . and in section 3 , we introduce a magnetic field on the flavor brane and construct the gravitational solution by re - solving the type iia plus flavor brane action , both in confined ( bubble ) case and deconfined ( black brane ) case .",
    "the magnetic - dependent solution is also given in this section . in section 4",
    ", we discuss some physical quantities by imposing the constructed solution with some special constraints in the confined case . in section 5",
    ", it shows the holographic renormalization in our calculation , and we evaluate the renormalized onshell action and the counterterms by our magnetic - dependent solutions . in section 6 , we discuss the holographic phase diagram with the magnetic field in the case of the probe approximation and backreaction respectively , then compare our results with lattice qcd .",
    "discussion and summary are given in the final section .",
    "a non - supersymmetric and non - conformal ( 3 + 1 dimensional ) yang - mills theory was proposed by witten @xcite as the low energy limit of a kaluza - klein ( kk ) reduction of a 4 + 1 dimensional @xmath11 super conformal theory which couples to massless adjoint scalar and fermions .",
    "this theory is the low energy effective theory describing the open string ending on the worldvolume of @xmath0 coincident d4-branes placed in the 10d minkowskian spacetime . by the dimensional reduction ,",
    "the theory is compactified on a circle ( denoted as @xmath10 ) of length @xmath12 . with the choice of boundary conditions for bosons ( periodic b.c ) and fermions ( anti - periodic b.c ) , the massless modes at low energy scale i.e. @xmath13 are the gauge fields of 3 + 1 dimensional @xmath14 yang - mills theory .",
    "the supersymmetry breaks down since the other modes ( including fermions ) get masses @xmath15 . if @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the string tension and 4d t hooft coupling respectively , the low energy theory could be decoupled from the kaluza - klein modes .",
    "however , as it is known there is not any simple description in the most interesting region @xmath18 in witten s model . as a conjecture by holography",
    ", there should be a dual description in terms of a classical gravity theory on a background arising as the near - horizon limit of sourced @xmath0 d4-branes , and we can therefore obtain many detailed informations in the region of @xmath19 .",
    "such a background produced by @xmath0 d4-branes would have the topology of a product @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 represents the 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime where we live in .",

    "the theory describes confinement in the dual field theory and the chiral symmetry breaks at zero temperature once it couples to the chiral massless quarks .",
    "it is achieved to add a stack of @xmath2 pairs of suitably @xmath5-branes embedded in the @xmath0 d4-branes background geometry to introduce @xmath2 chiral fundamental massless quarks as @xcite in witten s model .",
    "quarks are in the fundamental representation of color and flavor group since they come from the massless spectrum of the open strings which are stretching between the color and flavor branes . as the flavor @xmath5-branes are probes in this system , their backreaction to the geometric background is neglected .",
    "correspondingly , the fundamental quarks in the dual field theory are in the quenched approximation . besides , the flavor branes offer a @xmath28 symmetry which could be identified as the global flavor symmetry holographically in the dual field theory .",

    "when the temperature increases , the connected position on @xmath5-branes falls into the horizon in the @xmath52 phase as in figure 1 .",
    "it thus turns to the deconfined case and the @xmath5-branes become parallel ( disconnected ) .",
    "accordingly , the chiral symmetry is restored since the flavor symmetry group remains @xmath28 in the configuration of a stake of parallel @xmath5-branes .",
    "so the confined / deconfined or chiral phase transition could be identified as the hawking - page transition of the background with the connected / parallel configuration of the flavor branes .",

    "obviously , in the probe approximation the renormalized onshell d8-brane action reads    @xmath224.\\ ] ]    and its pressure is ,    @xmath225.\\label{eq:79}\\ ] ]    consequently , we can obtain the phase diagram in the probe approximation by comparing the pressure ( [ eq:74 ] ) and ( [ eq:79 ] ) with the equation @xmath226 since the contribution form @xmath227 in @xmath77 could be neglected . ]",

    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "and we also notice that the contribution from the magnetic field is quadratic for any @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq:76 ] ) shows @xmath9 decreases when @xmath169 increases ( as shown in figure 2 ) which is in agreement with the lattice qcd results @xcite .    ) or ( [ eq:69 ] ) . *",

    "* lower * : the phase diagram in t - b plan from some lattice qcd results in @xcite .",
    "@xmath230 is a parameter in the lattice calculations . ]",
    "let us turn to the case of backreaction . to get the phase diagram , first we need to imposing ( [ eq : modified mkk ] ) and (",
    "[ eq : modified t deconfined ] ) on ( [ eq : confined ren ] ) and ( [ eq : deconfined ren ] ) , thus obtain the pressure of each phase as ,    @xmath231,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "then we find the following relation between the critical temperature @xmath9 and the magnetic field @xmath169 ,    @xmath233    where    @xmath234    and we have also imposed the spectial choice ( [ eq : constants - 2 confined ] ) ( [ eq : spectial choice for const ] ) ( [ eq : constant for deconfined phase - 2 ] ) ( [ eq:47 ] ) to ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) .",
    "so similar to the case of the probe approximation , ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) shows the critical temperature increases by the effect of the flavors without magnetic field .",
    "but notice that the factor in front of the magnetic field is positive , it shows that the behavior of ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) is totally different from the probe approximation and is not in agreement with the lattice qcd results @xcite .",
    "in fact ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) should be a scheme - dependent statement thus it depends on the choices of the appropriate interpretation ( also the numbers of colors and flavors ) . as mentioned ,",
    "since we are less clear about the full relations between the integration constants and the constant magnetic field @xmath169 , we therefore use the same ansatz as the most simple choice as @xcite for the undetermined integration constants .",
    "however the behavior of @xmath9 with @xmath169 ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) is actually quite sensitive to the relations between the integration constants and the constant magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also mentioned the deconfined geometry does not strictly correspond to the deconfinement phase in the dual field theory .",
    "accordingly it is not surprised that ( [ eq : smeaed phase diagram - 1 ] ) does not agree with lattice qcd , but the less clear relation of the integration constants leads to an ambiguous behavior of @xmath9 with @xmath169 if imposing ( [ eq : constants - 2 confined ] ) ( [ eq : spectial choice for const ] ) ( [ eq : constant for deconfined phase - 2 ] ) directly . hence in order to return to the probe approximation , we have to additionally require ,    @xmath235    and    @xmath236    although we do not obtain the explicit relations between all the integration constants and the constant magnetic field .",
    "otherwise , the original geometrical configuration might be totally deformed and the perturbative solution both for confined and deconfined phase would become unreliable .    besides , there may be an alternative comparison scheme available , which is motivated by the in heavy - ion collision experiment phenomenally . before the collision ,",
    "the nuclei are confined and an extremely external ( strong ) magnetic field is created when the collision happens .",
    "accordingly , we treat the confined case without the magnetic field as the initial state of the nuclei , then the magnetic field @xmath169 induces the phase transition when the collision happens .",
    "we therefore need to solve @xmath237 to obtain the phase diagram , it would be more simple ,    @xmath238-\\frac{n_{f}}{n_{c}}\\frac{1131b^{2}}{448\\pi m_{kk}^{4}}.\\label{eq:69}\\ ] ]    ( [ eq:69 ] ) is a desired phase diagram since it qualitatively agrees with the lattice results @xcite as well . in this scheme , although the explicit relation between the integration constants and the magnetic field is not explicitly clear , the behavior of the diagram would be unique .",
    "this is due to that the contribution from the magnetic field to the pressure of the deconfined phase is always positive ( see also @xcite ) . and on the other hand , the probe limit of this model is definitely allowed to return .",
    "therefore it gives the unique behavior as ( [ eq:69 ] ) .",
    "however we must keep in mind that the scheme of the interpretation we choose .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed gravitational solutions as a magnetic - dependently holographic background in the witten - sakai - sugimoto model , by considering the backreaction of the flavors and the magnetic field .",
    "thus it corresponds to a quantum field theory ( or qcd ) with dynamical flavors in an external magnetic field .",
    "we have proved out our gravitational solutions satisfy their equations of motion explicitly in the first order of @xmath1 . and",
    "the solutions are analytic both in confined and deconfined case at low ( zero ) or high ( finite ) temperature . therefore these solutions are able to study the the influence of dynamical flavors in an external magnetic field as a holographic version of @xcite . in order to determine the integration constants in our solutions",
    ", we require the backgrounds are completely regular in the ir region of the dual field theory as the unflavored case since the flavors are small perturbations . on the other hand",
    ", we also try to turn off the sources or vevs of some gauge invariant operators in the dual field theory as another constraint",
    ". however the calculation shows it is not enough to determine all the integration constants just by these two constraints .",
    "so we should keep those undetermined integration constants as some generic parameters in our theory .    in order to compare our magnetic - dependent case with @xcite",
    ", we naively chose the same value for the undetermined integration constants as @xcite , to study some physical properties about hadronic physics in an external magnetic field , such as the running coupling , string tension , baryon mass , vector meson mass spectrum .",
    "we find the uv behavior of the running coupling is not affected by the presence of the magnetic field . and the string tension , the mass of baryon or meson increase by the flavor or the magnetic field .",
    "but we need to keep in mind these behavior should depend on which scheme is chosen and where some observables is kept fixed in the theory , since theories with different numbers of flavors are different . additionally , because of the simply choice as @xcite for those undetermined integration constants , the results in this part are not strictly rigorous thus some of them might still seem unrealistic .",
    "moreover , it shows the physical significance of our work by studying the holographic renormalization and thermodynamics with our magnetic - dependently gravitational solution .",
    "we employ the counterterm @xcite and its covariant formula @xcite for this model then evaluate it by our magnetic solution .",
    "the motivation for studying this counterterm is to renormalize the free energy , to study the hawking - page transition holographically in the presence of the magnetic field . in some applications of the witten - sakai - sugimoto model ,",
    "holographic renormalization may not be necessary for studying the phase transition .",
    "since those concerns are the difference of the free energy of the various configurations of the flavor branes in the same background , which is not the hawking - page transition of this model .",
    "so the difference of the free energy could be finite in those approaches ( such as @xcite ) .",
    "however , in our calculations , holographic renormalization is needed since we , more than that , also consider the transition between differently geometric background . and according to our calculations , if the parameters in the covariant counterterms are allowed to depend on the magnetic field as @xcite , we find the present counterterms are enough to cancel all the divergences .    in particular , after the holographic renormalization , we have concentrated the attention on the holographic phase diagrams in the presence of the magnetic field , and compare it with lattice qcd results . in our backreaction case , we find the pressure of both phases evaluated by our magnetic - dependent solution agrees with @xcite qualitatively although we have kept the undetermined integration constants generic as mentioned .",
    "while the behavior of the phase diagram is a bit ambiguous in the backreaction case , in the probe approximation it is clear and in agreement with the lattice qcd @xcite qualitatively ( figure 2 ) .",
    "thus it could be interpreted as the inhibition of confinement or chirally broken symmetry by the magnetic field holographically .",
    "finally , let us comment something more about our work .",
    "as an improvement to @xcite , we have employed the technique used in @xcite to take into account the backreaction from flavors and the magnetic field .",
    "because of the presence of the magnetic field , actually we need to solve a set of highly non - linear equations of motion first to obtain a magnetic - dependently gravitational solution , as shown in ( [ eq : eoms in confined phase ] ) and ( [ eq : eom for deconfined phase ] ) . since it is hopeless to find an analytic solution from these extremely complicated equations , we solve them by keeping the leading @xmath239 terms . while it is a challenge to keep all the orders of the dbi action to solve analytically , some numerical calculations might be worthy . besides , during our calculations",
    ", we have restricted that @xmath5-branes are placed at antipodal points of @xmath10 - circle in the confined phase .",
    "so to extend this part to the non - antipodal case would be natural , and the chiral symmetry could also be restored after deconfinement transition .",
    "moreover , it is also interesting to turn on a chemical potential and a magnetic field together on the flavor branes in this framework , since a similar phenomena , named as `` inverse magnetic catalysis '' , has also been found by using this model in the probe approach of @xcite .",
    "however , there would be a non - vanished chern - simons term necessarily ( @xmath71 gauge field strengh ) .",
    "there have been some discussions about the inverse magnetic catalysis in the einstein - maxwell system as @xcite .",
    "however , as a difference from einstein - maxwell system and also a computational challenge , we have to consider the additional romand - romand field in the bulk and the non - vanished chern - simons ( or wess - zumino ) term if taking into account the backreaction from the flavor branes ( full action ) . while the computation is difficult , it would be quite interesting for a future study . ] if turning on the chemical potential and the magnetic field together as @xcite .",
    "accordingly , it would be more difficult to search for an analytic solution even in the expansion of small baryon charge , magnetic field and @xmath1 in that case since the equations of motion would be complicatedly coupled to each other once the backreaction is considered",
    ". we would like to leave these interesting topics for a future study to improve our calculations about holographic qcd .",
    "this work is inspired by our previous work @xcite in ustc , and also by @xcite the recent research on the magnetic field in heavy - ion collision from our colleagues .",
