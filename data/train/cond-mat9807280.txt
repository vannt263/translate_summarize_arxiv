    "double layer two - dimensional ( 2d ) carrier systems as realized in semiconductor nanostructures are of interest with respect to fundamental phenomena as fractional quantum hall effect and superconductivity because of the interlayer carrier interaction @xcite . depending on the width of the potential barrier that separates the two layers one has to distinguish the regime of quantum - mechanical coupling via tunneling for small barrier widths from that of interlayer coupling mediated by ( direct or effective ) electron - electron interaction for sufficiently large barriers . in the former case ,",
    "the frictional aspects of superconductivity @xcite and of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite have been studied . in the latter case ,",
    "when the large barrier allows independent control of electron conduction in the two layers , the frictional drag effect manifests itself when a current driven along one layer ( layer @xmath2 ) induces , via momentum transfer , a drag voltage in the second layer ( layer @xmath3 ) under conditions that no current flows in this well @xcite .",
    "the drag effect has been studied experimentally for two 2d electron systems ( 2des ) , two 2d hole systems ( 2dhs ) , but also in situations with layer @xmath2 @xmath3 being a 2des or 2dhs , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently the effect of a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers has been investigated @xcite .",
    "theoretical work on the frictional drag effect was devoted to elucidating the microscopic mechanism of the momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the calculated temperature dependence of the frictional drag due to direct coulomb electron - electron interaction shows strong dependence on the inter - layer separation @xmath4 @xcite while in the experiment by gramila et al .",
    "@xcite , the temperature dependence of the observed frictional drag for separations at least up to @xmath5 nm exhibits almost no dependence on @xmath4 , and has been interpreted as being due to the exchange of virtual phonons .",
    "the frictional drag accomplished by the exchange of virtual phonons has been studied theoretically in .",
    "this work , however , because of its conceptual complexity requires involved numerical computations and does not lead to analytical expressions for the dependence of the frictional drag on the system parameters .",
    "therefore , we present here an analytical derivation of the drag scattering rate for the particular case of asymmetric two - layer systems ( @xmath6 ) coupled by virtual exchange of acoustic phonons including its temperature dependence .",
    "we thus model the experimental situation investigated by t. j. gramila , et al .",
    "@xcite and find by using the corresponding system parameters the characteristic @xmath7-dependence of the drag scattering rate in quantitative agreement with these experimental data .",
    "our model as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] consists of two parallel electron sheets separated by a distance @xmath4 with electron densities @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the layer extensions @xmath10 and @xmath11 . according to experimental observations , a current @xmath12 driven along the layer @xmath2 by applying a voltage @xmath13 leads by frictional drag to a voltage @xmath14 in the layer @xmath3",
    ". the drag scattering rate in a double layered system can be defined as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the electric fields connected with the voltages @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the transport relaxation time which determines via the mobility @xmath19 the current in the layer @xmath2 ; @xmath20 is the electron effective mass .",
    "following , we obtain by using the linearized boltzmann equation for the drag scattering rate @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the normalization length , @xmath23 the electron in - plane momentum , @xmath24 the electron spin , @xmath25 the transferred momentum , @xmath26 the fermi distribution function determined by temperature @xmath7 and fermi energy @xmath27 with fermi wave vector related to the areal electron concentration @xmath28 , by @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is the transition probability of two electrons from the states @xmath31 and @xmath32 with energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , into the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 with energies @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the index @xmath39 refers to the type of effective electron - electron interaction which causes this transition .    in this work we consider effective electron - electron interaction mediated by the exchange of virtual acoustic phonons related to the piezoelectric ( @xmath40 pa ) and deformation ( @xmath40 da ) potential coupling . using fermi s golden rule ,",
    "@xmath30 can be written in the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the transition matrix element .",
    "phonon mediated electron - electron interaction appears in second order perturbation theory with respect to the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the transition matrix element of this process is visualized by the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fg2 ] . for intrasubband scattering the vertex part of this diagram corresponds to @xmath43 with the subband electron density @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 depends only on the absolute value of @xmath47 @xcite @xmath48 here we describe electron - phonon interaction in the framework of the isotropic model with @xmath49 being the longitudinal sound velocity , @xmath50 the crystal mass density , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the piezoelectric and deformation potential constants , respectively , averaged over the directions of the vector @xmath53 and the phonon polarizations @xcite .",
    "we assume also that all elastic parameters of the sample are the same so that phonons are not reflected from the interfaces separating different materials ( for instance between gaas and algaas ) .",
    "the phonon propagator is @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 and a summation over phonon momenta @xmath53 corresponds to the internal phonon line ( the dashed line in the diagram ) . in the above expression of the phonon propagator , @xmath57 is the lifetime of the intermediate phonon states with respect to all processes which are destroying these intermediate states . for virtual intermediate states",
    "there is no energy conservation at the vertices of the diagram , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 can be different from @xmath59 and we may assume infinite lifetime @xmath57 for the intermediate phonons when calculating the drag rate .",
    "then all integrals with respect to the energy parameters in eq .",

    "it is easy to check that with such definition of @xmath62 , the expressions of the form factors ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) are valid both for @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in calculating the form factors",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 we have assumed that electrons are localized in symmetric infinitely high quantum wells with the width @xmath69 , thus having @xmath70 and @xmath71 as explicit forms for the electron density functions in layers @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . in eqs .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) and taking integrals over @xmath75 and over directions of the vector @xmath76 by exploiting @xmath77-functions , we can represent the drag scattering rate in the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 in this equation @xmath80 and the limiting energy @xmath81 is obtained from the energy and momentum conservation laws . now making use of the identity @xmath82 and taking integrals in eq .",

    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq17 ] ) that in the framework of the adopted approximation when the lifetime of the intermediate phonon states is infinite , _ i.e. _ @xmath94 , the drag scattering rate , eq .  ( [ eq14 ] ) ,",
    "is independent of the inter - layer spacing @xmath4 .",
    "this means that our theory refers to the experimental situation when @xmath4 is smaller than the phonon mean free path , @xmath95 , associated with the finite phonon lifetime . for @xmath96",
    ", we have to consider the finite @xmath97 in the phonon propagator , which would lead to an exponential dependence of the scattering probability of @xmath98 .",
    "using eqs .  (",
    "[ eq14 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) we plot the temperature dependence of the drag scattering rate divided by @xmath0 for identical layers in a symmetric gaas / algaas double quantum well structure as in coupled both by pa- and da - phonon mediated electron - electron interaction ( fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] ) .",
    "it is seen from this figure that the contribution of the da interaction is smaller ( approximately by one order of magnitude ) than that of the pa interaction .",
    "this is because the scattering probability due to long - range piezoelectric interaction includes an additional factor @xmath99 with respect to the short - range deformation potential interaction .",
    "this difference is strongly pronounced at low temperatures @xcite where the pauli exclusion principle restricts electron - phonon scattering processes in a fermi gas to those with small angles .",
    "our calculations correspond to the experimental situation of ref .   where the drag rate was measured for samples with the inter - layer spacing @xmath100 , and @xmath101 nm with the electron concentration @xmath102 @xmath74 in a temperature range from @xmath2 to @xmath103 k. starting from the lower edge of this interval , where the drag rate is small because it is dominated by small angle scattering connected with a small momentum transfer , the drag rate increases with increasing temperature . towards the upper edge of the interval , large angle scattering becomes dominant which reduces the increase of the drag scattering rate in temperature .",
    "this gives rise to a peak of the function @xmath104 both for drag caused by the exchange of da- and pa - phonons at approximately the same temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] . the maximum drag rate of about @xmath2 s@xmath105 k@xmath106 due to combined effect of da- and pa - phonons is obtained at a temperature near @xmath107 k in good agreement with the experimental results for the samples with the inter - layer spacing @xmath108 nm @xcite .",
    "our theory is not applicable for much larger interlayer spacing ( as _ e.g. _ for the sample with @xmath109 nm in ref .  ) .",
    "we believe that in this sample due to other scattering mechanisms , the intermediate virtual phonon states which effectively realize electron - electron interaction , are destroyed and this leads to the exponential suppression of the drag scattering rate observed in the experiment .    in fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] we present the temperature dependence of the drag scattering rate for a symmetric double quantum well system as in fig .  [ fg3 ] but for different values of the matched electron density @xmath28 ( the second line from the top ( @xmath102 @xmath74 ) is identical with solid line in fig .  [ fg3 ] . ) . with increasing @xmath28 the peak structure becomes broader while the maximum value decreases and the position @xmath110 shifts to higher temperature .",
    "this shift follows approximately the relation @xmath111 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] ) which supports our findings that the peak position is related to the energy @xmath112 which separates the regions of small ( @xmath113 ) and large ( @xmath114 ) angle scattering .",
    "we have also studied the drag scattering rate as in fig .",
    "[ fg3 ] with fixed density @xmath115 @xmath74 but changing density @xmath9 at different temperatures .",
    "a peak occurs always at matched densities for which the momentum transfer is most efficient .",
    "it is seen for @xmath116 k and most clearly pronounced at @xmath117 k while for @xmath118 k it is only a small feature on an otherwise monotonous function of @xmath9 .",
    "this strikingly different behavior for @xmath118 k as compared to @xmath117 and @xmath119 k which is similar to the experimental finding in refs .",
    ", can be attributed to the changing dominance of small and large angle scattering with temperature and @xmath9 .    in conclusion , we have calculated the drag scattering rate between spatially separated electron layers due to the virtual phonon exchange via da and pa mechanisms we have shown that the frictional drag due to pa coupling is dominating . assuming infinite lifetime of the intermediate virtual phonon states , the frictional drag does not depend on the interlayer separation . according to our calculations the temperature dependence of the drag scattering rate divided by @xmath0 exhibits a pronounced peak both at matched electron density of two layers and at temperatures where transition from small to large angle scattering occurs .",
