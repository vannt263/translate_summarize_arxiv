    "with the explosive growth of user generated contents ( ugc ) on online media , it becomes an important issue to predict the popularity dynamics of ugc items , including microblogs , tweets , videos , to name a few .",
    "popularity prediction has important implications in many domains , including viral marketing , public opinion monitoring , etc .",
    "early studies devote to characterizing the distribution of the popularity over an aggregation of ugc items  @xcite and making prediction by exploiting temporal correlations  @xcite .",
    "recently , researchers began to model the popularity dynamics of individual ugc items  @xcite . however , these models usually assume an aggregate stochastic process without distinguishing the triggering effects of different forwarding actions in the diffusion - and - reaction process . therefore , although these models gain success in predicting , say , the citation counts of scientific papers and view counts of youtube videos , they are not applicable to model popularity dynamics over a microblogging network , where interactions among users matter much in popularity dynamics . in this paper , we propose a probabilistic model using a self - excited hawkes process  ( sehp ) to model the process through which individual microblogs gain their popularity .",
    "this model explicitly captures the triggering effect of each forwarding , distinguishing itself from the reinforced poisson process  ( rpp ) based model presented in  @xcite , where all previous forwardings are simply aggregated as a single triggering effect  ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we validate the proposed model by applying it on sina weibo , the most popular microblogging network in china .",
    "experimental results demonstrate that this model consistently outperforms the model based on reinforced poisson process .",
    "when a microblog spreads , it creates a _ cascade _ on the microblogging network .",
    "the popularity dynamics of each microblog during observed time period @xmath0 $ ] can be characterized by a set of time stamps @xmath1 which denote the occurrence time of each forwardings . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the total number of forwardings . without loss of generality",
    ", we have @xmath3 . for a microblog , we model its popularity dynamics using an sehp characterized with the following rate function @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the initial triggering strength that reflects the attractiveness of the microblog , @xmath6 is the triggering strength of each subsequent forwarding , and @xmath7 is the index of the last forwarding before time @xmath8 .",
    "we set an exponential decaying function with exponent @xmath9 for simplicity .        according to the survival theory , given that the @xmath10-th forwarding arrives at @xmath11 , the probability that the @xmath12-th forwarding arrives at @xmath13 follows @xmath14and the probability that no forwarding arrives between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 assuming that forwardings during different time intervals are statistically independent , the likelihood of observing a cascade of a microblog and its subsequent forwardings during time interval @xmath0 $ ] follows @xmath18 by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ ratefunction ] ) , ( [ p1 ] ) , and ( [ p2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqlikelihood ] ) , we obtain the logarithmic likelihood @xmath19 we employ maximum likelihood estimation to infer the parameters in the proposed model . with the estimated parameters ,",
    "the model can be used to predict the expected number @xmath20 of forwardings of a microblog up to any given time @xmath8 . with the rate function in eq .",
    "( [ ratefunction ] ) , we obtain the prediction function @xmath21",
    "experiments are conducted on a dataset from sina weibo , published by the wise 2012 challenge .",
    "we select microblogs that were submitted during july 1 - 31 , 2011 and have more than 10 forwardings during the first hour and more than 100 forwardings during forty - eight hours after submission .",
    "this resulting dataset consists of 5670 microblogs and their cascades .",
    "to validate the prediction performance of the sehp , we compare it with the state - of - the - art model based on reinforced poisson process  @xcite , in terms of two metrics :         * mean absolute percentage error  ( @xmath22 ) : it measures the average derivation between the predicted and observed popularity over all microblogs . denoting the predicted popularity for a microblog @xmath12 up to time @xmath8 as @xmath23 and its actual popularity as @xmath24",
    ", the mape over @xmath25 microblogs can be written as @xmath26 * @xmath27 : it measures the fraction of microblogs , correctly predicted under a given error tolerance @xmath28 .",
    "specifically , the accuracy of popularity prediction over @xmath25 microblogs is @xmath29 the threshold @xmath28 is set as 0.2 in this paper .",
    "we set the training period , i.e. , @xmath16 , as 6 hours and then predict the popularity for each microblog from the 1st to 42nd hour after the training period . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the sehp model consistently exhibits lower error and higher accuracy than the rpp model .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a probabilistic model to characterize and predict the popularity dynamics of microblogs using an sehp .",
    "experiments on a sina weibo dataset demonstrated that this model consistently outperforms the baseline model based on reinforced poisson process .",
