    "in the recent decade , many advances in both observations and computational models have provided new insights into the workings and evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the emerging picture is that interstellar turbulence plays the key role in ism structure formation and evolution ( mckee & ostriker 2007 ) . in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds , the ism is turbulent on scales ranging from less than a parsec to a few kiloparsecs ( crovisier & dickey 1983 ; stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999 ; deshpande et al .",
    "2000 ; dickey et al . 2001 ; elmegreen et al . 2001 ; elmegreen & scalo 2004 ) .",
    "although the observational evidence for the importance of turbulence in the ism is overwhelming , many questions remain open .",
    "for example , what are the dominant energy sources and physical processes that convert kinetic energy into turbulence ( burkert 2006 ) ? at what scales and",
    "through which modes is turbulent energy dissipated ( heyer & zweibel 2004 ) ?",
    "how do the level and type of turbulence depend on properties of the interstellar gas ( e.g. presence / absence of star formation , presence / absence of tidal effects , or the strength of magnetic field ) ?",
    "since no complete theory of astrophysical turbulence exists , studying its effects on the multiphase ism can be challenging and calls for a combination of numerical and observational efforts .",
    "statistical studies have proved to be important in characterizing the magnetized turbulent ism @xcite , however the interpretation of results is not always straight forward .",
    "several statistical methods have been extensively used for both observational and synthetic data .",
    "these statistics include probability density functions ( pdfs ) , wavelets , the principal component analysis , higher order moments , velocity coordinate spectrum ( vcs ) , and velocity channel analysis ( vca ) , to name just a few ( gill & henriksen 1990 ; brunt & heyer 2002 ; kowal , lazarian & pogosyan 2000 , 2004 , 2006 ; lazarian & beresnyak 2007 ) .    most of these statistical methods require large datasets with a large spatial or velocity dynamic range , and produce a single , mostly one - dimensional , measure .",
    "this results in the lack of spatial information about turbulent properties across a given interstellar cloud , or a galaxy , making a connection with underlying physical properties highly difficult .    in this paper",
    "we explore a new method for obtaining spatial information about the level and nature of ism turbulence on the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) observations of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the smc , a dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group , has a highly gas rich ism environment ( see , stanimirovic et al .",
    "1999 , henceforth known as sx99 ) , and is an excellent candidate for ism studies .",
    "being nearby ( 60 kpc , @xcite ) , the smc is distant enough for all its objects to be treated as having roughly the same distance , unlike the milky way where distance determination is relatively uncertain .",
    "the hi observations of the smc , obtained using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) and the parkes telescope ( sx99 ) , have been used for several investigations , including the hi spatial power spectrum and the kinematic study of hi , which revealed the existence of many expanding shells of gas and three supergiant shells . the power law index of hi density and velocity distributions was derived in sx99 and @xcite , while the genus statistic in @xcite revealed spatial variations of hi morphology . because the sx99 smc data set is well studied , it is a perfect candidate to investigate new statistical methods",
    ". we can acquire new information , but also test and confirm past results , as well as validate the promise of these statistical tools for further use in other observational studies .    in this study",
    ", we investigate turbulent properties of the hi in the smc by applying the higher order moments on the hi column density image .",
    "we then use a database of mhd simulations to bootstrap the spatial distribution of the sonic mach number across the smc .",
    "the crucial aspect of our approach is the confluence of observations and numerical simulations : only by combining the two we can retrieve the spatial variations of turbulent properties .",
    "this is the reason why we oscillate between observational and synthetic data in this paper .",
    "we also investigate whether and how interstellar shocks leave footprints on the hi gas by employing the bispectrum , a three point statistical measure , on the smc hi column density image .",
    "again , to interpret our results we apply the same statistics on the database of mhd simulated column density images .",
    "in particular , the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with   [ sec : background ] by providing a brief summary of previous work regarding the statistical methods used in our study . in   [ sec : data ] we describe the smc hi column density map and the database of numerical simulations of compressible mhd turbulence used for the comparison with observations . in ",
    "4 we introduce higher order moments and their dependence on the sonic and alfvenic mach numbers .",
    "we then apply higher order moments on the smc hi observations to derive an image of the sonic mach number across the smc , in   5 .",
    "we compare our results with an observational estimate of the sonic mach number of the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) in the smc , based on a comparison of the spin and kinetic temperature of hi absorption profiles , in   [ ratio ] . in ",
    "[ ps ] we show how the power - law slope of the spatial power spectrum depends on the sonic mach number and use this to gauge the alfvenic mach number of the hi gas seen in emission . in ",
    "[ sec : bispectrum ] we present an analysis of the bispectrum of the smc , as well as a brief discussion of the noise and windowing effects . in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we provide a discussion of our results , followed by our conclusions .",
    "higher order statistical moments of density fluctuations have been studied extensively . for example , the variance of density fluctuations has been shown to increase with the sonic mach number @xmath0 @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if turbulence is the dominant structuring mechanism , @xmath0 can be estimated from the variance of density fluctuations .",
    "however , the observable that is the most easily available from observations for various ism tracers is the column density . while this is a less direct measure of turbulence compared to velocity , a comparison between observations and simulations is the most straight forward in case of column densities .",
    "only very recently , kowal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , henceforth referred to as klb , have investigated how variance , skewness and kurtosis , the 2nd , 3rd and 4th order moments respectively , depend on @xmath0 .",
    "they found strong correlations : as the sonic mach number increases , so does the gaussian asymmetry of the column density ( and density ) pdfs due to gas compression via shocks , resulting in the increase of variance , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "klb used limited resolution models of 128@xmath3 in their study , while burkhart et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , henceforth known as bfkl , saw the same trends using high resolution isothermal simulations . in both studies ,",
    "the moments had little dependence on the alfvn mach number ( @xmath4 ) , or the line - of - sight ( los ) orientation used for integrating 3-d simulated data cubes .",
    "these studies are motivational , and imply that the sonic mach number of turbulence in interstellar clouds could be characterized by variance , skewness and kurtosis of observed column density distributions .",
    "the two - dimensional spatial power spectrum characterizes the energy distribution over spatial scales .",
    "sx99 found that the spatial power spectrum of individual hi velocity slices is well fit by a power - law , with an average slope of @xmath5 .",
    "stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) showed that the power - law slope steepens when several channels are integrated together , and used this to estimate the density power - law slope of @xmath6 and the velocity slope of @xmath7 . no obvious breaks or preferred scales",
    "were found over the range of 30 pc to 4 kpc .",
    "the density and velocity spectral slopes are similar , and in the case of incompressible mhd turbulence , density behaves as a passive scalar and thus scales in the same way as velocity ( monin & yaglom(1967 ) , lithwick & goldreich ( 2001 ) , cho & lazarian 2003 ) .",
    "however , the estimated slopes are slightly more shallow than the predictions for the kolmogorov spectrum ( @xmath8 ) , which is expected for incompressible fluids with a weak magnetic field .",
    "however , different types of turbulence are expected to have different spectral slopes .",
    "for example , in incompressible fluids with a strong magnetic field , the spectrum is expected to be even steeper and scale as @xmath9 ( biskamp 2003 ) .",
    "when the medium is supersonic ( as we will see later applies to parts of the smc ) , these relations are no longer valid due to shocks forming highly asymmetric density structures .",
    "klb demonstrated that the spectral slope of mhd turbulence becomes more shallow with increasing @xmath10 .",
    "this can be understood as shocks in supersonic turbulence create more small scale structure in density @xcite .",
    "this behavior was found to be weakly dependent of the alfvn mach number .",
    "while the spatial power spectrum has long been applied on both observations and simulations , it essentially uses only the amplitude of the fourier transform of the initial signal , while the phase information is totally ignored .",
    "the bispectrum , however , is a three point statistical measure which incorporates both the amplitude _ and phase _ of the correlation of signals in fourier space . because of this",
    ", it can be used to search for nonlinear wave - wave interactions and characterize how shocks affect turbulent properties of the ism .",
    "the bispectrum has been used in cosmology and gravitational wave studies to detect departures from gaussianity @xcite , and for the characterization of wave - wave interactions in laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "the first application of the bispectrum on synthetic astrophysical mhd turbulence was in bfkl .",
    "bfkl found a general correlation between the bispectrum of 2d column density and 3d density maps for simulated data cubes of 512@xmath3 resolution . also , supersonic models showed a much greater degree of correlation between structures of different scales than subsonic models . while comparing models with the same sonic mach number , models with a stronger magnetic field ( i.e. sub - alfvnic ) showed enhanced correlations .",
    "these results are encouraging and suggest that the bispectrum can be also used to provide insight into the nature of the turbulence cascade .",
    "the small - scale hi structure of the smc was observed with the atca , a radio interferometer , in a mosaicking mode ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "observations of the same area were obtained also with the 64-m parkes telescope , in order to map the distribution of large - scale features . both sets of observations",
    "were then combined ( see sx99 ) , resulting in the final hi data cube with angular resolution of 98@xmath11 , velocity resolution of 1.65 , and 1-@xmath12 brightness temperature sensitivity of 1.3 k , to the continuous range of spatial scales between 30 pc and 4.4 kpc .",
    "the velocity range covered with these observations is 90 - 215 . for details about the atca and parkes observations , data processing , and data combination ( short spacings correction )",
    "see staveley - smith et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and sx99 .",
    "the hi column density image is shown in figure  [ fig : smc ] .",
    "we corrected the original image by multiplying the hi column density of each pixel ( @xmath13 in atom @xmath14 ) with the correction factor @xmath15 derived by sx99 : @xmath16        as the original position - position - velocity ( ppv ) smc cube has @xmath17 pixels , the resulting column density image is a 2d array with @xmath18 pixels .",
    "we generate a database of 13 3d numerical simulations of isothermal compressible ( mhd ) turbulence by using the code of klb and varying the input values for the sonic and alfvnic mach number .",
    "the sonic mach number is defined as @xmath19 , where is @xmath20 is the local velocity , @xmath21 is the sound speed , and the averaging is done over the whole simulation .",
    "similarly , the alfvnic mach number is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the alfvnic velocity , @xmath24 is magnetic field and @xmath25 is density .",
    "klb used resolution of 128@xmath3 , while we use 512@xmath3 .",
    "details about klb s code were published ( see cho et al .",
    "2003 ) and the code was used in several studies .",
    "we briefly outline the major points of their numerical setup .",
    "the code is a second - order - accurate hybrid essentially nonoscillatory ( eno ) scheme ( see * ? ? ? * ) which solves the ideal mhd equations in a periodic box : @xmath26 = { \\bf f } ,   \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial { \\bf b}}{\\partial t } - \\nabla \\times ( { \\bf v } \\times{\\bf b } ) = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with zero - divergence condition @xmath27 , and an isothermal equation of state @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the gas pressure . on the right - hand side ,",
    "the source term @xmath30 is a random large - scale driving force ] .",
    "we drive turbulence solenoidally , at wave scale @xmath31 equal to about 2.5 ( 2.5 times smaller than the size of the box ) .",
    "this scale defines the injection scale in our models in fourier space to minimize the influence of the forcing on the generation of density structures .",
    "density fluctuations are generated later on by the interaction of mhd waves .",
    "the time @xmath32 is in units of the large eddy turnover time ( @xmath33 ) and the length in units of @xmath34 , the scale of energy injection .",
    "the scale of energy dissipation is defined by the numerical diffusivity of the scheme .",
    "the magnetic field consists of the uniform background field and a fluctuating field : @xmath35 .",
    "initially @xmath36 .",
    "we divided our models into two groups corresponding to sub - alfvnic ( @xmath37 ) and super - alfvnic ( @xmath38 ) turbulence . for each group",
    "we computed several models with different values of gas pressure ( see table [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "we ran compressible mhd turbulent models , with 512@xmath3 resolution , for @xmath39 crossing times , to guarantee full development of energy cascade . since the saturation level is similar for all models and we solve the isothermal mhd equations , the sonic mach number is fully determined by the value of the isothermal sound speed , which is our control parameter .",
    "the models are listed and described in table  [ tab : models ] .",

    ", figure  [ fig : fakecloud ] ( left ) shows a density field for a sub - alfvnic , subsonic simulation . to calculate the column density distribution we integrate the 3d density fields along a given los .",
    "we introduce the following nomenclature throughout the paper :  x column density \" or  column density in the x direction \" refers to the density cube being integrated along the x direction ( parallel to the mean magnetic field ) .",
    "this description is similar for the y and z directions ( perpendicular to @xmath43 ) . in the case of the figure  [ fig : fakecloud ] ( left ) , the los is along the z axis , and the magnetic field is oriented along the x axis .          in order to compare simulations with the smc data ,",
    "we apply a simple scaling to the simulated column density distributions : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the standard deviation and @xmath46 denotes the arithmetic mean of the column density image .",
    "this method , often referred to as the _ standard score _ , standardizes all data sets used in this study . after the scaling ,",
    "the new data set has values which represent the difference between the original data values and the sample mean , in units of the standard deviation .",
    "the same scaling was applied on the smc hi column density image .      another consideration to take into account is the fact that simulated cubes are periodic and do not have boundaries . in other words",
    ", simulations do not have a decrease in the column density values that is seen in the smc data as one goes radially out from the center of the image .",
    "klb showed that boundaries affect higher statistical moments of density , but have little effect on the spatial power spectrum and the bispectrum , generally only impacting the large scales .    to introduce cloud boundaries to our simulations",
    ", we multiply the simulated 3d density fields by a 3d spherical function , which has a value of one within a sphere of radius @xmath47 and is decaying outside of this radius with a gaussian profile .",
    "we choose a @xmath47 value of 128 pixels , which is 4 times smaller then the box size .",
    "an example of the simulation with a boundary is shown in the right - hand panel in figure  [ fig : fakecloud ] .",
    "please note that we impose cloud boundaries on the simulated cubes of homogeneous turbulence after turbulence has been fully developed .",
    "this results in the simulated column density profiles being similar to the smc profile , however , is different from simulations of turbulence being developed within cloud boundaries .",
    "the most straightforward statistical properties of a distribution are the mean value and the variance . the mean arithmetic value and the variance of the distribution of , for example , column density @xmath48 are given by : @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of samples or points of the mesh in the case of simulation data .",
    "the mean value is a less important property in our studies so we do not consider it here ; however , it is required to calculate higher moments .",
    "variance measures the width of the distribution and is always positby the third and fourth - order statistical moment .",
    "skewness is defined as :    @xmath52    if a distribution @xmath48 is gaussian , its skewness is zero .",
    "negative skewness indicates the data are skewed in the left direction ( the tail of the pdf is extended to the left , or towards low density values ) , while positive values imply that the distribution is skewed in the right direction ( the tail of the pdf is extended to the right , or towards high density values ) .",
    "kurtosis is a measure of whether a quantity has a distribution that is peaked or flattened compared to a gaussian distribution .",
    "kurtosis is defined in a similar manner to skewness , only is derived from the forth order statistical moment . if a data set has positive kurtosis then the pdf of data values will have a distinct sharp peak near the mean and elongated tails .",
    "if a data set has a negative kurtosis then its pdf will be flat at the mean .",
    "kurtosis is defined as :    @xmath53        [ fig : skewplot ]    variance , skewness and kurtosis of simulated column densities depend on turbulent properties , specifically the sonic mach number .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : kowal ] for the simulated column density distributions with cloud boundaries .",
    "error bars are computed by estimating the standard deviation between models with the same sonic mach number but differing los orientations .",
    "all three moments depend almost linearly on the sonic mach number , for @xmath54 .",
    "klb noticed a similar trend for supersonic simulations but focused only on @xmath55 .",
    "our simulations extend this result all the way to @xmath56 . for @xmath57 klb found that both skewness and kurtosis have a rather flat dependence on the sonic mach number , while the variance continues to decreases gradually for subsonic models .",
    "the increase of higher order moments with @xmath10 can be explained in that as the mach number increases , the abundance of small - scale density structure increases , resulting in a broader density pdf .",
    "bfkl showed that the increase of higher - order moments with @xmath10 is not a resolution effect , since they replicated the result of klb , ( who used cubes of 128@xmath3 resolution ) with cubes of 512@xmath3 resolution .    which one of three high - order moments represents the best statistics to describe turbulence in observational data ?",
    "while variance has a linear dependence over a broad range of @xmath10 values , it depends on the exact scaling of the data set , making a direct comparison between simulations and observations difficult . on the other hand , skewness and kurtosis",
    "are , by definition , normalized by the standard deviation and do not have this problem .",
    "in addition , variance changes with the length along the los , since perturbations can add up in a random walk fashion . all of this , as well as the result by klb that kurtosis is the least affected by cloud boundaries , suggest that for our immediate comparison of observations with the mhd simulations , the higher order moments , skewness and kurtosis , are more appropriate statistics .      while it is useful to know the mach number of the ism in a global sense , even more interesting is to see how it varies spatially and whether it correlates with local star forming regions where high turbulence is expected . to characterize small scale departures from gaussian distributions within the column density distributions , we create moment maps of the simulated column densities using a circular moving kernel .",
    "we do this by moving a circle of a given radius @xmath58 across the image and calculating the skewness and kurtosis at all points .",
    "first we must decide on a kernel size that will enclose enough pixels to provide reliable statistics . according to tabachnick & fidell ( 1996 ) , the standard error in skewness ( ses )",
    "can be estimated by @xmath59 and the standard error in kurtosis ( sek ) can be estimated by @xmath60 , where @xmath51 is the number of points used to calculate the skewness / kurtosis . generally ,",
    "if a value of skewness / kurtosis falls within @xmath61ses / sek , then the distribution is considered to be normal , while values of skewness / kurtosis larger than twice the absolute value of ses / sek imply significant non - gaussianity .",
    "figure  [ fig : skewerror ] shows @xmath62 ses and sek as a function of the kernel radius @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , ses / sek is proportional to @xmath63 ; the smaller the radius , the higher the absolute value of ses / sek .",
    "thus , we select @xmath64 pixels , which corresponds to the point where @xmath62 ses / sek starts to deviate from zero and ensures that gaussianity is represented by @xmath62 ses / sek@xmath65 .    using a circular moving kernel",
    "we generate 3rd and 4th moment maps of simulated column density distributions . to ensure there are no resolution artifacts , we briefly explore correlations between skewness and kurtosis of the derived moment maps on a pixel - to - pixel basis .",
    "based on the work by klb and bfkl , and also our figure  [ fig : kowal ] , we expect for supersonic models a correlation of both skewness and kurtosis with the sonic mach number , and that skewness and kurtosis agree in sign and relative value . however , as subsonic models show unexpected behavior at low resolutions ( from the klb study ) , the dependence of skewness and kurtosis on the sonic mach number is not strong .    figure  [ evidence ] shows pixel - to - pixel comparison between skewness and kurtosis for two example models : a supersonic with @xmath66 ( left panel ) and a subsonic with @xmath67 ( right panels ) .",
    "it is evident that the supersonic model shows a good correlation between kurtosis and skewness , while the subsonic model does not .",
    "this is exactly as expected .",
    "this result proves that our approach of deriving moment maps is not resolution limited although we use a smaller number statistics within each circular kernel ( @xmath68 pixels ) .",
    "this also highlights another interesting property : regions of moment maps with a good correlation between skewness and kurtosis could be interpreted by supersonic mhd turbulence , while a poor correlation may be caused by subsonic turbulence .",
    "we present in the appendix another technique that could be used to further identify subsonic regions .",
    "[ sec : mmaps ]    we first calculate the higher order moments of the whole smc hi column density image . we find that the skewness is 1.52@xmath69 , and the kurtosis is @xmath70 .",
    "the estimated uncertainties are determined by calculating twice the ses or sek .",
    "figure  [ fig : skewplot ] suggests that on average the hi in the smc is supersonic with @xmath71 .    to characterize small scale departures from the gaussian distribution within the smc we create 3rd and 4th moment maps of the smc using a circular kernel , as discussed for simulations in section  [ sec : mom ] .",
    "we repeat a similar process for the smc as we did with the simulations .",
    "we use a radius of @xmath64 and calculate moments in a circular kernel moving across the smc .",
    "this is equivalent to convolving the original hi image with a gaussian function with a fwhm of 30@xmath72 .",
    "the resultant moment images therefore have a lower resolution than the original hi image . after this",
    "we create a mask which cuts off pixels below a column density of @xmath73 @xmath14 in the hi column density image , to exclude increase in noise along the edges of the image .",
    "this is done to eliminate noisy pixels in moment maps , since pixels along the edge have significantly smaller column density values .",
    "figures  [ fig : skewmap ] shows the distribution of skewness and kurtosis across the smc ( the hi column density image was standardized using the standard score method ) , with overlaid hi contours smoothed to 30@xmath72 resolution .",
    "these maps retain the overall shape of the smc , which can be seen in the hi contours .",
    "familiar features of the smc , such as the east wing and bar , regions of high star formation , can be picked out in these maps .        generally , skewness ranges from @xmath74 to 1 , with several discrete regions reaching higher positive or negative values . for kurtosis",
    ", most pixels range from @xmath75 to 1 , with again several exceptions . based on figure 3 ,",
    "this suggest that large areas in the smc have @xmath76 and are subsonic or transonic . along most of the bar",
    "the skewness and kurtosis correlate well .",
    "this suggests that the mhd turbulence could be the cause of local departures from gaussianity in the hi column density distribution .",
    "we warn once again that both our study and earlier work find strong dependence of skewness and kurtosis on the sonic mach number only for supersonic models , while the dependence for subsonic models is rather weak .",
    "interpreting subsonic turbulence is therefore difficult , and poor correlation between skewness and kurtosis could be due to either subsonic turbulence or some other physical mechanisms .",
    "several interesting regions stand out in figure  [ fig : skewmap ] .",
    "* along the hi bar and the eastern wing region both skewness and kurtosis are negative , reaching values even lower than what is seen in figure 3 for global averages .",
    "based on expectations from numerical simulations this could be explained by the subsonic isothermal mhd turbulence , as shown in figure 5 . most of the hi bar and the wing therefore could be explained as being subsonic , with several discrete concentrations with almost no turbulence , probably tracing quiescent regions and potential sites of future star formation .",
    "however , as subsonic regions are hard to constrain from simulations , additional processes may be also playing an important role .",
    "* from hi peaks radially outward , both skewness and kurtosis gradually increase .",
    "the highest values of both skewness ( @xmath77 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath78 ) are found along the hi bar and correspond to areas of compressed hi contours .",
    "these regions could be interpreted as having the highest level of turbulence ( with @xmath79 ) in the smc .",
    "this suggests that the most turbulent regions may be associated with the shearing flows and/or shocks between the bar and the surrounding hi .",
    "* sudden change in the behavior of both skewness and kurtosis can be noticed around ra 01@xmath80 10@xmath81 , dec @xmath82 10@xmath72 .",
    "for example , skewness flips from high positive to high negative values over an angular scale of @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , this flip happens in the direction of an hi extension towards the lmc and again may be pointing out streaming or tidal motions caused by the interactions between the smc and the lmc .        in order to compare the range of values found in the smc and the simulations we plot several histogram of the skewness and kurtosis values in figure  [ fig : kurtsmcsim ] .",
    "these figures show that the majority of smc pixels generally match well with the mildly supersonic models with @xmath84",
    ". however , the smc distribution appears to be more narrow in terms of both skewness and kurtosis values than the @xmath85 simulation . for subsonic and very supersonic models , the values of skewness and kurtosis of the smc",
    "are not in the range of the simulations .",
    "as shown above , with our limited angular resolution of 30@xmath72 we see strong hints that different regions in the smc have different turbulent properties , suggesting spatial variations of @xmath10 .",
    "we would now like to combine all this information into an image of @xmath10 for the smc .",
    "as already discussed , based on the klb study , kurtosis is the least prone to effects caused by cloud boundaries and as figure 3 suggests has an almost linear shape for @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , we fit a linear function for all values of kurtosis @xmath87 .",
    "this function can be inverted to estimate @xmath10 : @xmath88 .",
    "pixels in the @xmath10 image with corresponding kurtosis @xmath89 are set to zero and most likely mark subsonic regions , or could be caused by additional processes . the resultant map is shown in figure  [ fig : ms_var ] ( left ) .",
    "as expected already , most of the area of the smc bar and the eastern wing could be interpreted as having subsonic or transonic mach numbers , @xmath90 .",
    "several concentrated regions across the smc indicate very quiescent environments , most of them unfortunately have a size close to our angular resolution .",
    "regions with the highest sonic mach number , @xmath91 , are found around the bar and correspond to compressed hi contours .",
    "we can quantify the fraction of hi with different @xmath10 .",
    "the most likely quiescent regions ( set to zero in our map ) comprise 8% of the mapped area .",
    "regions with @xmath92 comprise about 40% , while about the same fraction is contained in transonic regions with @xmath93 .",
    "regions with higher turbulence , @xmath94 constitute about 10% of the area .",
    "figure  [ fig : ms_var ] ( right ) shows contours of the h@xmath95 emission ( obtained by kennicutt et al .",

    "we find no obvious correlation between the hi velocity dispersion and our @xmath10 map .",
    "this lack of correlation could be due to projection effects , and/or large los depth of the smc .",
    "in addition , velocity dispersion ( similar to velocity centroids ) is subject to the interplay of several statistical effects ( lazarian & esquivel 2003 , esquivel & lazarian 2005 , esquivel et al .",
    "the most obvious is the contribution of both velocities and densities to the resulting measure .",
    "more subtle , but still important , are effects of velocity - density correlations and non - gaussianity .",
    "these effects make centroids unreliable when dealing with supersonic turbulence ( esquivel et al .",
    "effects of phase transitions resulting in the existence of cold and warm hi and the pliable equation of state corresponding to interstellar hi are likely to act in a similar way .",
    "thus the velocity dispersions obtained from spectral lines are substantially affected by densities , which are the quantities that we deal in this study .",
    "they should be distinguished from the true velocity dispersions , which , unfortunately , are not available through spectral line observations .",
    "constraining the sonic mach number of the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) observationally is highly difficult due to the lack of direct measurements of the hi temperature .",
    "this is the main reason why in the previous section we used the hi column density image of the smc and a database of numerical simulations to explore spatial variations of @xmath10 . to investigate reliability of our results we compare our derived @xmath10 distribution with results from an observational method which constrains temperature of the cold hi , and therefore @xmath10 of the cnm",

    "is related to the 1d mean square turbulent velocity : @xmath101 where @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath102 is the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "multiplying this by 3 gives the mean square 3d turbulence velocity @xmath103 of the cnm . to estimate the sonic mach number we need to divide @xmath104 by the sound speed @xmath105",
    "we adopt a mean atomic weight of @xmath106 for the ism of smc abundance ( see mao et al .",
    "2008 ) . using this",
    ", we can write :    @xmath107    for each of 29 radio continuum sources from @xcite we derive @xmath99 and use the estimated @xmath98 to calculate the sonic mach number of the cnm clouds .",
    "@xcite used three different methods to estimate the spin temperature .",
    "as our aim is to compare @xmath0 with values derived from the los integrated hi emission profiles , we use their los averaged spin temperature ( or @xmath108 ) .",
    "the median value of the spin temperature is 43 k.    a histogram of derived @xmath0 values is shown in figure  [ fig : hist ] .",
    "the median mach number for the whole sample of 29 sources is @xmath109 , and the histogram peaks around @xmath110 .",
    "this suggests that the internal cnm macroscopic motions are highly supersonic . to compare these values with the ones derived using the method of higher - order statistical moments we show a histogram of data points from the @xmath0 map in the right panel of figure  [ fig : hist ] . while the observed histogram suffers from the low number statistics , due to a small number of suitable ( strong ) sources , the two histograms have a similar shape : almost a gaussian central distribution with a tail at higher mach values",
    "obviously , the observationally inferred @xmath0 values suggest at least a factor of 2 higher level of turbulence across the smc than what we derived using higher statistical moments .",
    "this is not surprising as the observed values trace predominately the cnm , while the @xmath0 map was derived using the hi column density image and therefore is affected by both cnm and wnm .",

    "the slope of the fourier transform of the two point autocorrelation function , or the spatial power spectrum , also provides information on important properties of turbulence flows . in particular ,",
    "the slope of the power spectrum is known to depend on the sonic mach number . with a database of numerical simulations we explore whether the slope of the spatial power spectrum depends also on the alfvn mach number .",
    "the alfvn mach number dependence would be especially interesting as we could use higher - order statistical moments to estimate the sonic mach number , and from there the alfvn mach number and the strength of the magnetic field .",

    "figure  [ fig : power ] shows how the power spectral slope changes with the sonic mach number .",
    "the slope is increasingly shallow for supersonic models and levels off for very high mach number turbulence .",
    "this is expected as higher mach number turbulence has more density irregularities and more power on small scales .",
    "we have shown in this figure slopes for two values of @xmath113 : 0.7 ( dashed line ) and 2.0 ( dotted line ) .",
    "for both strong and weak magnetic fields , the power spectrum slope increases with @xmath10 , however this increase is steeper for super - alfvenic and subsonic turbulence .",
    "for all cases the error bars were calculated from the standard deviation in the power spectral slope derived from column density images for three different los orientations .",
    "the smc has a power spectrum slope of @xmath6 and spatially mostly @xmath114 .",
    "based on the difference between slopes expected for sub - alfvnic and super - alfvnic turbulence in figure  [ fig : power ] , it is likely that the super - alfvnic description fits better the slope of the smc .",

    "the bispectrum is a complex function which measures both phase and magnitude information between different wave modes . as this is the first application of the bispectrum on the hi data we show in figure  [ fig : example ] a visual example of the difference between the power spectrum and the bispectrum",
    "this figure shows the original hi column density image of the smc ( top left ) , and the same image but with manipulated phases ( top right ) . to obtain the top right image we fourier transformed the smc image and randomized the phases with a gaussian random distribution but left the _",

    "even though the phases of the top images are very different , the power spectrum uses only amplitude information and is identical for both images , as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : example ] .",
    "however , the bispectrum looks very different for the two images , as expected , and offers an insight into the phase information .    in practice ,",
    "our calculation of the bispectrum involves performing a fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the column density functions and the application of equation  [ eq : bispectra ] .",

    "supersonic models show a higher degree of wave - wave correlations over subsonic models . for a fixed @xmath10 , models with a higher magnetic field ( sub - alfvnic , e.g. @xmath1270.7 ) show somewhat stronger correlations then the models with a weaker magnetic field ( super - alfvnic ) although this difference is not striking .",

    "while there are small differences in the bispectral amplitudes , there is essentially no significant difference in the contour shape for the three bispectra .    to properly compare the smc bispectrum with simulations we apply a _ windowing",
    "function on the smc column density image to simulate the effect of periodic boundaries .",
    "we use the hanning window @xmath132 function , defined as : @xmath133 where @xmath51 is the number of pixels along the x or y axis , and @xmath134 ranges from 0 to @xmath135 .",
    "this windowing function makes the map periodic in the fourier space .",
    "the second column of figure  [ fig : bispectraglobal ] shows the resultant bispectra for all three cases of hi column density integrations .",
    "the windowing seems to slightly change bispectral amplitudes on the large scales , but leaves the general structure of the bispectral contours intact , although some smoothing effects are observed .",
    "the increase in large scale correlations is at a level of @xmath136% .        before interpreting the smc bispectrum",
    "we briefly investigate how the presence of noise in the observational data affects the bispectrum .",
    "we made the noise image of the hi column density by taking a single velocity channel from the smc hi data cube without hi emission and integrating this image over the whole velocity range .",
    "the bispectrum of the noise image ( normalized using the standard score method ) is shown in figure  [ fig : noise ] ( right ) . in the case of purely gaussian noise",
    ", we expect a random distribution over the whole space of wavelengths . as a result",
    ", the bispectrum will have a gradual increase in amplitude , with the highest amplitude being at large @xmath31 ( or small scale ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : noise ] ( left ) illustrates this effect for a pure gaussian distribution .",
    "the bispectrum of the smc noise image shows essentially the same trend , suggesting that we are dealing mainly with gaussian ( random ) noise . as is obvious from figures 12 - 14 , the bispectral amplitude increases in the opposite direction ( from large to small scales ) .",
    "the effect of noise is therefore the most important at the smallest spatial scales , and we keep this in mind when interpreting the bispectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : bispectraglobal ] shows the degree of wave - wave correlations in the hi distribution .",
    "modes are obviously strongly correlated at the largest scales and show weaker correlation at small scale .",
    "this trend is similar to what was found for various mhd simulations , and obviously very different from the case of gaussian noise .",
    "in addition , the @xmath137 line shows the strongest correlations , as is also seen in the simulations .",
    "however , contrary to simulations where the level of correlation gradually decreases along this line , we see significant small - scale variations .",
    "several local peaks are noticeable and a strong break at mid - scales .",
    "the break occurs around @xmath138 pc and is seen in all three integrations of the hi data cube .",
    "this could be due to a lack of interactions between turbulent eddies at the scale of @xmath2 pc , caused possibly by numerous expanding shells in the smc .",
    "hatzidimitriou et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and stanimirovic ( 2007 ) showed that shells in the smc range in size from 30 to 800 kpc , however the radius distribution peaks at @xmath139 pc .",
    "the break in the bispectrum may be signifying the lack of correlations on scales close to the typical shell diameter , or some additional physical processes .",
    "we can also compare the bispectrum of the smc with the bispectra of various simulations . by visual inspection of figures 12 - 13",
    ", the closest simulation to the smc in terms of contour shapes is the one for @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "further work in this area is required to derive a real measure to quantitatively compare observed and simulated bispectra .",
    "using 3rd and 4th statistical moments of the hi column density image and boothstreping turbulent information from a database of isothermal mhd simulations , we have mapped spatial variations of the sonic mach number across the smc .",
    "while most of the hi seen in emission in the smc appears to be subsonic or transonic , several supersonic regions have emerged from our study . it is interesting that these regions do not correlate well with the most recent sites of star formation and seem to point out to large scale shearing or tidal flows .",
    "commonly , it is believed that supernovae and superbubbles are the main drivers of galactic turbulence ( mccray & snow 1979 ) , with a typical size of @xmath142 pc .",
    "while we do not have high enough resolution to see changes on such small scales ( @xmath143 ) in our derived map of @xmath0 , most of the star - forming bar of the smc appears to have subsonic or transonic properties when viewed at resolution of 30@xmath72 .",
    "the most turbulent regions in the smc may be tracing some kind of shearing flows between the smc bar and the surrounding hi .",
    "this suggests that smc s chaotic history with the lmc and our own milky way has probably left strong turbulent imprints on the hi gas .",
    "the lack of a turnover in the hi spatial power spectrum on the largest observed scales is also indicative of the fact that turbulent energy injection happens largely on scales larger than the size of the smc @xcite .",
    "similarly , goldman ( 2000 ) suggested that the hi turbulence in the smc was induced by large - scale flows from tidal interactions with the milky way and the lmc about @xmath144 yrs ago .",
    "such large - scale bulk flows could have generated turbulence through shear instabilities , and this turbulence has not have had enough time to decay .",
    "most of the hi in the smc has a sonic mach number of 1 - 2 .",
    "this is on average at least two times smaller than what we inferred from hi absorption observations for the cnm in the smc , @xmath1453.5 - 4 .",
    "similarly , for the cnm in the milky way heiles & troland ( 2003 ) found @xmath146 with a large dispersion . a sonic mach number of about 4 - 5 is commonly assumed for cold gas in molecular clouds ( federrath et al . 2009 ) .",
    "for example , heyer et al . ( 2006 ) measured from co observations @xmath147 for the rosette molecular cloud , and @xmath148 for g216 - 2.5 . on the other hand , hill et al . (",
    "2008 ) found that the distribution of the warm ionized medium ( wim ) in the milky way can be best fit by models for mildly supersonic turbulence with @xmath149 .",
    "turbulent properties of the hi in emission in the smc are therefore closer to properties of the wim in the milky way than properties of the cnm .",
    "this may suggest a large fraction of warm relative to cold hi being traced in hi emission .    in the milky way , the hi is known to consist of at least two components with different temperature : the wnm with @xmath150  k and the cnm with @xmath151  k. in addition",
    ", there could be a substantial amount of gas at intermediate temperatures @xcite .",
    "due to its lower metallicity , the hi in the smc has different properties .",
    "dickey et al . ( 2000 ) found @xmath152  k , in agreement with theoretical expectations by wolfire et al .",
    "( 1995 ) whereby the existence of the two - phase medium is possible only at higher pressures compared with the range that applies for solar neighborhood conditions .",
    "they also estimated the fraction of cold hi in the smc to be @xmath153% .",
    "this is lower than @xmath154% found for the milky way .",
    "as our simulations are isothermal it is obvious to wonder how does the multi - phase hi affect our statistics and conclusions .",
    "we investigate this in figure  [ fig : ex ] by producing a simulated data cube from a weighted combination of two cubes , one subsonic ( @xmath10=0.7 ) and one supersonic .",
    "the subsonic cube represents contribution from warmer gas , while the supersonic cube represents the cold gas .",
    "we combined the two cubes with different emphasis on warm vs cold gas , obtained the column density image of the resultant cube , and calculated its moments .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex ] shows that for the case when the supersonic cube has @xmath10=2.0 skewness of the final cube with up to 50% of subsonic gas will be biased towards supersonic gas and will appear dominated by cold gas .",
    "if we increase the sonic mach number of the supersonic cube to 4.0 , the dominance of the higher turbulence is even more pronounced .",
    "a cube with up to 60 - 70% of subsonic gas and 25% of supersonic gas , will still have high skewness biased by the supersonic contribution .",
    "considering that the hi column density image results in the mean @xmath93 , significantly lower than what is expected for the cold hi , the fraction of the cnm along any los is most likely @xmath155% .",
    "this supports the dickey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate of the fraction of cold hi in the smc being about 15% .",
    "two different statistical approaches in our study suggest that the hi gas in the smc seen in emission is super - alfvnic . as we have shown in figure  [ fig : power ]",
    ", in addition to the sonic mach number the spectral slope of the spatial power spectrum is sensitive to the alfvenic mach number for @xmath156 .",
    "the sub - alfvnic models generally show steeper slopes due to large scale influence of magnetic fields .",
    "thus , if one independently knows the sonic mach number , it is possible to estimate the alfvenic one using just the column density data .",
    "while the dependence of the spectral slope on the alfvenic mach number has not received much attention in the past , it is somewhat expected .",
    "essentially , magnetization decreases compression in the shocks .",
    "strong magnetic forces mix up density clumps preventing formation of isolated peaks , which results in a steeper spectrum .",
    "in addition , in the sub - alfvnic case we expect oblique shocks to be disrupted by alfvn shearing , which in turn , produces more small scale shocks @xcite .",
    "another indication that the hi in the smc is super - alfvnic comes from the bispectrum .",
    "the very sharp decrease in the bispectral amplitudes from large to small scales observed for the smc is the closest to the trend found for simulated data for the case of @xmath85 and @xmath157 .",
    "detailed comparison between simulated and observed bispectra awaits future work , however this qualitative comparison is certainly encouraging .    assuming on average @xmath84 , the power spectrum slope suggests a super - alfvnic hi in the smc with @xmath158 .",
    "this is generally in agreement with the observationally inferred strength of the magnetic field by mao et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . using their estimate for @xmath159 @xmath160 g , a radius of the smc of 2 kpc , the total hydrogen mass of @xmath161 m@xmath162 , and a typical velocity dispersion of 20 ( stanimirovic et al . 2004 ) , we estimate @xmath163 .",
    "as the alfvenic mach number shows the nature of the interplay between gas pressure and magnetic fields , it appears that the gas pressure in the smc dominates over the magnetic pressure .",
    "our bispectrum analysis of the smc hi data was the first attempt to apply bispectrum on observed astrophysical data .",
    "while more detailed comparison between observations and simulations awaits future work , we clearly see trends in the bispectral amplitudes similar to what was found for simulations of supersonic mhd turbulence .",
    "the most interesting finding is , however , the effect of small - scale variations in the @xmath124 correlations and a strong break in correlations at a scale of 160 pc . such small - scale variations , or jumps , have not been seen in the bispectrum of simulated data .",
    "we can speculate about several possible scenarios that could explain their existence .",
    "the jumps could be caused by the energy injection due to processes other than turbulence affecting specific spatial scales .",
    "alternatively , the jumps may be marking the presence of colder or multi - phase gas .",
    "similarly , the observed break in the bispectrum at about 160 pc is intriguing . as we already pointed out",
    ", it is interesting that most expanding shells in the smc ( more than 500 were cataloged so far ) have a diameter of @xmath164 pc .",
    "the break could be due to the lack of correlations on scales similar to the distance between two shell centers .",
    "obviously this will require further studies .",
    "a natural question to ask is how results presented in this paper depend on the resolution of numerical simulations .",
    "for example , kritsuk et al . ( 2007 ) investigated how resolution of numerical simulations affects the power spectrum of density .",
    "these authors found that the spectral index estimates based on low resolution simulations bear large uncertainties due to the bottle neck contamination , and that the power spectra of @xmath165 simulations are substantially shallower then models with resolution of @xmath166 .",
    "however , while kritsuk et al .",
    "( 2007 ) only examined hydrodynamic turbulence , beresnyak et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that the slopes were very different between the mhd and pure hydrodynamic cases .",
    "for instance , the slopes for hydrodynamic simulations showed a pronounced and well defined bottleneck effect , while the mhd slopes were much less affected .",
    "this is indicative of mhd turbulence being less local than the kolmogorov turbulence , and suggests that our simulations will be less affected by resolution .",
    "in addition , kritsuk et al . ( 2007 ) found a difference in the slope between hydrodynamic @xmath165 and @xmath166 simulations to be 0.17 .",
    "this would result in a change of @xmath167 only and will not change our interpretation .",
    "we also add that in the case of higher statistical moments and the bispectrum bfkl confirmed trends noticed by klb at lower resolution of 128@xmath3 .",
    "another issue that should be further addressed and that could affect our results is the type of numerical forcing of turbulence .",
    "federrath et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently investigated the effects of solenoidal vs. compressive ( divergence - free vs. curl - free ) forcing on a variety of statistics including pdfs and higher order moments .",
    "they found that both types of driving mechanisms are compatible with observations of molecular clouds however , depending on the data studied , one type could be superior then the other in terms of the statistics and reproduced observables .",
    "this implies that different regions in the smc may exhibit statistical signatures of either compressive or solenoidally driven turbulence .",
    "we have investigated a new method for constraining turbulent properties of the ism , specifically the sonic mach number , by using the hi column density image and a database of numerical simulations with a range of sonic and alfvenic mach numbers . by applying the 3rd and 4th statistical moments on both observed and simulated data we have derived the spatial distribution of the sonic mach number across the smc with angular resolution of 30@xmath72 . to provide an estimate of the alfvenic mach number we used two approaches : the spatial power spectrum and the bispectrum . using the database of numerical simulations",
    "we have shown that the spatial power spectrum varies with both the sonic and alfvenic mach numbers .",
    "if the sonic number is known the alfvenic number can be constrained from this dependence .",
    "the bispectrum shows the level of correlation between turbulent eddies of different size and depends greatly on the sonic mach number , and somewhat on the alfvenic mach number . by comparing the bispectra of observations and simulations we have gauged the importance of magnetic fields relative to the gas pressure in the smc .",
    "the following results were discussed in the paper .",
    "* skewness and kurtosis of the hi column density generally correlate well and are within the range expected from mhd simulations .",
    "this suggests that departures from gaussianity could be interpreted as being governed by mhd turbulence .",
    "* most of the hi in the smc bar and the eastern wing is subsonic or transonic with @xmath90 .",
    "sites of most recent star formation have @xmath96 .",
    "regions with the highest skewness and kurtosis , which could be interpreted as having @xmath91 , correspond to the edges of the bar .",
    "the most turbulent regions are most likely tracing tidal or shearing flows .",
    "the fraction of the smc with different turbulent properties is : 10% with @xmath94 , 80% with @xmath168 , and about 10% with very low values of @xmath10 . * using hi absorption profiles from dickey et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we have estimated that the cnm in the smc is highly supersonic with @xmath169 .",
    "this is at least a factor of two higher than what we measured from the higher statistical moments for the hi gas seen in emission .",
    "one possible reason for this discrepancy could be that hi emission is dominated by warm gas and the fraction of the cnm in the smc is @xmath170% . *",
    "the slope of the spatial power spectrum and the bispectrum suggest that the hi in the smc is super - alfvenic with @xmath158 .",
    "this is implies that the gas pressure dominates over the magnetic pressure .",
    "* the bispectrum of the hi column density shows large scale wave correlations suggesting a large scale energy injection mechanism .",
    "contrary to simulations which show a smooth decrease of wave - wave correlations from large to small scales , the smc bispectrum shows localized enhancements of correlations and at least one prominent break at @xmath2 pc .",
    "we speculate that the multi - phase medium , and/or energy injection by processes other than turbulence , could be responsible for the correlation jumps .",
    "the break on the other hand appears at a scale similar to the diameter of the majority of expanding shells in the smc .",

    "the additional zero points shift the distribution from gaussian ( the mean of our simulations with no scaling applied is unity ) to negative skewness and very peaked kurtosis producing a tight anti - correlation .",
    "because this technique only strongly affects subsonic areas we can use it to locate subsonic turbulence in the smc with skewness and kurtosis by looking for anti - correlation and very high values .",
    "these properties also hold for simulations with cloud boundaries imposed .",
    "note that one must use caution here and carefully examine the distribution of data .",
    "the application of this technique to the smc data is shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "this plot shows the skewness and kurtosis maps of the smc side by side with the modified beam .",
    "indeed , most regions are unchanged from the analysis in section  [ sec : mmaps ] .",
    "however a few regions stick out with signatures that are subsonic , that is , anti - correlation between skewness and kurtosis .",
    "two regions of the highest kurtosis are located in the area between the hi bar and the eastern wing . while kurtosis reaches values of 4 - 8 , the corresponding skewness values are negative , @xmath171 .",
    "again , such combination of skewness and kurtosis may correspond to simulations of subsonic isothermal mhd turbulence , and/or points out additional processes at work .",

    "<S> we investigate the nature and spatial variations of turbulence in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) by applying several statistical methods on the neutral hydrogen ( hi ) column density image of the smc and a database of isothermal numerical simulations . by using the 3rd and 4th statistical moments we derive the spatial distribution of the sonic mach number ( @xmath0 ) across the smc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that about 90% of the hi in the smc is subsonic or transonic . </S>",
    "<S> however , edges of the smc ` bar ' have @xmath1 and may be tracing shearing or turbulent flows . using numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate how the slope of the spatial power spectrum depends on both sonic and alfvn mach numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to gauge the alfvn mach number of the smc and conclude that its gas pressure dominates over the magnetic pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the super - alfvnic nature of the hi gas in the smc is also highlighted by the bispectrum , a three - point correlation function which characterizes the level of non - gaussianity in wave modes . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the bispectrum of the smc hi column density displays similar large - scale correlations as numerical simulations , however it has localized enhancements of correlations . in addition , we find a break in correlations at a scale of @xmath2 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this may be caused by numerous expanding shells of a similar size . </S>"
