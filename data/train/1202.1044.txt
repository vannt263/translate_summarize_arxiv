    "clusters of galaxies are ideal laboratories for investigating environmental effects in galaxy evolution .",
    "the extreme environments of the clusters  the high number density of galaxies , strong gravitational field , and dense hot gas filling inter - galactic space  allow us to study how these environmental factors affect the evolution of cluster member galaxies .",
    "a substantial body of observational evidence suggests that cluster environment significantly affects cluster galaxy evolution ; for example , the morphology - density relation @xcite , the redshift - blue galaxy fraction relation @xcite , or the density - h  i deficiency relation @xcite .",
    "researchers have proposed various physical mechanisms potentially responsible for these observational facts @xcite , including galaxy - galaxy interaction @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite , tidal interaction between galaxies and cluster potential @xcite , galaxy starvation @xcite , and ram pressure stripping ( * ? ? ? * hereafter referred as to rps ) .",
    "although it is not clear which mechanism plays the most important role in the morphological and color evolution of cluster galaxies , it is at least certain that rapid removal of the interstellar gas of galaxies is a key factor @xcite . in particular",
    ", rps caused by fast interaction between galaxies and the hot intra - cluster medium ( icm ) must play a very important role in gas removal @xcite .",
    "a number of observational studies have focused on this subject .",
    "the h  i gas of galaxies is systematically deficient in the cores of nearby rich clusters @xcite .",
    "deep h  i imaging revealed one - sided h  i gas flows around late - type galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "asymmetric distributions of molecular gas found in some cluster galaxies also suggest that the molecular gas is affected by ram pressure from the hot icm @xcite . recently ,",
    "elongated x - ray gas - flows from galaxies have been found in nearby clusters @xcite .",
    "in addition , many case studies have focused on ionized gas flows from cluster member galaxies probed by h@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "some pieces of evidence of dust stripping in the virgo galaxies have also been reported @xcite .",
    "we serendipitously discovered a number of very extended ionized gas filaments ( eig ) around the member galaxies of the coma cluster ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter yy08 ) ; @xcite ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter yy10 ) ) .",
    "the filaments are extended toward one side of the parent galaxies ( yy10 ) .",
    "the most remarkable example of the one - sided extension is the 60-kpc straight h@xmath0 filament found around d100 @xcite .",
    "another interesting object is the complex of ionized gas filaments , star - forming blue knots and young stellar filaments extended from an e+a galaxy rb199 ( `` fireballs '' ; yy08 ) .",
    "the morphology of the latter very much resembles strings of compact blue knots around the two galaxies falling into @xmath5 clusters found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted these peculiar features as star - forming regions in the gas stripped from the parent galaxies by the combined action of tidal interaction and rps .",
    "the fireballs is a low - redshift counterpart of these features ( yy08 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a similar structure around a low surface brightness galaxy ic  3418 in virgo cluster ( see also @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "yy10 found some properties specific to the eigs parent galaxies .",
    "the radial velocities of the parent galaxies are distributed either at the blue or at the red edge of the velocity distribution of coma member galaxies .",
    "in addition , almost all the parent galaxies have blue colors ; about 60%  of the parent galaxies are distributed well below ( bluer side ) from the color - magnitude relation ( red sequence ) of the early type galaxies of the coma cluster .",
    "these facts suggest that the parent galaxies are late - type galaxies which have recently fallen into the cluster .",
    "they have not yet been well processed in the cluster environment .",
    "further , yy10 classified the eigs into three categories : ( 1 ) disk star - formation + connected h@xmath0 gas , ( 2 ) no disk star - formation with connected h@xmath0 gas , and ( 3 ) detached h@xmath0 gas .",
    "@xcite found on @xmath6 images one - sided uv tails around a number of coma member galaxies whose morphologies resemble the eigs .",
    "more than half of their objects overlapped the eig galaxies discovered by yy10 .",
    "they assessed the statistical characteristics of these uv tail galaxies and concluded that these galaxies are newcomers to the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "good correlation between the eigs and the uv tails suggests that these two kinds of features were created by the same mechanism ; the most plausible one is rps .",
    "furthermore , this indicates active star formation occurs in the stripped gas in the cluster environment .    here",
    "we present the results of optical spectroscopic observations of the eigs around four coma member galaxies .",
    "we assumed that the cosmological parameters ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) = ( 0.73 , 0.24 , 0.72 ) and the distance modulus of the coma cluster is 35.05 @xcite .",
    "the linear scale at the coma cluster is 474 pc arcsec@xmath2 under this assumption .",
    "deep spectroscopic observations of four coma member galaxies , rb199 , ic  4040 ( gmp  2559 ) , gmp  2923 and gmp  3071 was performed using the faint object spectrograph focas @xcite attached to the subaru telescope on 20 may 2009 .",
    "two multi - slit masks for each of rb199 and ic  4040 were used to cover the complicated structure of the emission line regions over as wide an area as possible .",
    "gmp  2923 and gmp  3071 were observed using one multi - slit mask .",
    "the positions and lengths of the slits are shown in figures 1  4 .",
    "the width of each small slit was 0.8 .",
    "the lengths of the slits ranged from 10  to 30 . a 300 grooves mm@xmath2 grism , whose straight light travel wavelength is 6500  , was used .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the sky emission lines around 6700   is 7.8  , which means that the spectral resolving power @xmath10 of our spectroscopy is 850 ( the velocity resolution is about 350 km  s@xmath2 ) over h@xmath0 region .",
    "table 1 presents the observation log .",
    "slit positions of the spectroscopy of the extended ionized gas ( eig ) of rb199 ( `` fireballs '' : yy08 ) overlaid on a composite image of the h@xmath0 narrow band and @xmath11 band images .",
    "all the images used in figures 1  4 were taken with suprime cam attached to subaru telescope .",
    "details of the observations of these images were described previously in yy10 . ]     slit positions of the spectroscopy of the eig of ic  4040 overlaid on the net h@xmath0 image . ]     slit positions of the spectroscopy of the eig of gmp  2923 overlaid on the h@xmath0 narrow band image . ]     slit positions of the spectroscopy of the eig of gmp  3071 overlaid on the h@xmath0 narrow band image . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we tried to estimate the metal abundance of the bright knots around rb199 and ic  4040 using the model calculations by @xcite .",
    "we used [ n  ii]/[o  iii ] and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios to estimate the metal abundance .",
    "the kinematical characteristics and oxygen abundances of the bright knots are shown in table 3 .",
    "the emission - line widths of most of the bright knots except for s - k2 are too narrow to resolve with our spectral resolution , indicating that the knots are much colder than the extended filaments . as suggested by the emission line diagnostic diagrams ( figures 18 , 19 and 20 ) , the bright knots except for s - k3 and se - k4 have basically low oxygen abundances ; log(o / h)+12 @xmath12 .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "s - k3 of ic  4040 shows super solar abundance ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) .",
    "because this knot is located at marginal region between h  ii regions and liners in the diagnostic diagrams , shock heating may contribute enhancement of the forbidden lines , in particular , the [ n  ii ] line , of this knot .",
    "the one - sidedness of the morphologies of the eigs of the coma cluster strongly suggests rps as the primary formation mechanism of these features ( yy08 ; yy10 ) .",
    "all four of the observed eigs exhibit a monotonically - increasing pattern in their velocity fields . these types of velocity structures have been suggested in many numerical simulations of rps @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed three - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of rps incorporating radiative cooling .",
    "they found that radiative cooling fragments the disk gas of ram - pressured galaxy .",
    "this fragmentation forms holes in the disk and the holes accelerate the gas stripping . as a result ,",
    "stripped gas flows straight behind the disk , such that the width of the wake of the stripped gas becomes much narrower than the width observed in models without cooling @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined observable values such as the density , velocity and morphology of rps wakes formed in simulations .",
    "we compared the velocity fields of the eigs around the coma galaxies with those of the rps simulations conducted by @xcite . before making the comparison , we roughly estimated the age of the eigs .",
    "the velocity gradient of the eigs of rb199 and ic  4040 is @xmath17 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 .",
    "the distances from the parent galaxies to the most distant filaments of the eigs are @xmath18 kpc . assuming uniform acceleration with distance , @xmath19 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2",
    ", it takes @xmath20 myr for the filaments to reach current locations , where @xmath21 is the distance from the galaxy in the unit of kpc . in the case of the most distant filaments of rb199 and ic  4040",
    ", it would thus be @xmath22 myr .",
    "note that this number is the maximum value , because the real flow is not a stationary accelerated one .",
    "the most distant part of the flow would be formed by the gas which was rapidly accelerated and reached its maximum speed in the early stage of the stripping event .",
    "thus the minimum age of the wake would be simply given by the length divided by the current velocity at the tip , @xmath23 myr .",
    "these values are consistent with those predicted for the 100-kpc scale wakes formed in rps simulations @xcite .",
    "the velocity field of the eig of ic  4040 ( red circles ) overlaid on that predicted by a numerical simulation made by @xcite .",
    "the observational data are not corrected for projection effect .",
    "the gray scaled contours represent the velocity field of the stripped gas in the simulation at a time 250 myr after the collision between the model galaxy and the icm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reproduced by permission of the aas ) .",
    "the collision velocity is 1413 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the cut off temperature of the cooling curve of the model is @xmath24 k. ]    in the simulations conducted by @xcite , the velocity field of the stripped gas is highly turbulent in the early phase of rps .",
    "some gas components have very high velocities , close to the colliding velocity between the galaxy and the icm , while some gas components have negative relative velocities with respect to the galaxy .",
    "after 250 myr from the time of the galaxy ",
    "icm collision , the velocity field morphology begins to smooth out .",
    "the relative velocity monotonically increases with the distance from the galaxy ; the main part of the stripped gas has a relative velocity of 900 km  s@xmath2 at 150 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "the width of the velocity distribution is about 700 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "figure 22 overlays the data points for ic  4040 on a velocity field map taken from @xcite .",
    "clearly , the overall trend of the eigs velocity fields is consistent with the simulation .",
    "the acceleration rates of the stripped gas are @xmath25 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 for rb199 and ic  4040 , which is comparable to that of the main stream of the wake of the simulation ; @xmath26 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 .",
    "additionally , the simulation predicts that part of the stripped gas near the parent galaxy should have a very high relative velocity of @xmath27 km  s@xmath2 ( figure 22 ) .",
    "this feature corresponds to se - f1 ( lv ) of ic  4040 ( se - f1(lv ) ) .    the main difference between the simulations and the observed data is the width of the velocity distribution .",
    "numerical simulations made so far have predicted wide velocity distribution ( @xmath28 km  s@xmath2 ) perpendicular to the stream direction . @xcite predicted much narrower velocity distribution ( 700 km  s@xmath2 ) by incorporating radiative cooling , but it is still larger than that seen in the observations .",
    "the velocity fields of the rb199 and ic  4040 eigs are well - ordered except for se - f1(lv ) .",
    "the width of the velocity distribution of the eig of ic  4040 is about @xmath29 km  s@xmath2 , which is a factor of two narrower than the simulations .",
    "this discrepancy may be partly due to insufficient spatial coverage and detection limit in our observations .",
    "we observed only the bright parts of the eig filaments and could not follow the faint thin clouds , which may have much higher velocities than the bright dense clouds .",
    "further , the spatial coverage of our observation was limited by slits .",
    "thus , our observation did not cover the entire velocity field of the eigs . a wide field ,",
    "two dimensional spectroscopy would be needed for further quantitative comparison between observations and the simulations .",
    "the morphology of the wake of the stripped gas also differed between the simulations and the observation .",
    "while many simulations predict a widely spread wake , most eigs in the coma cluster have narrow , straight morphologies ; the most remarkable example is the eig around d100 @xcite .",
    "the eigs around gmp  2923 also has a narrow morphology .",
    "the eigs around gmp  3071 and rb199 are wider , but the widths do not exceed the size of the galaxies .",
    "evaporation of outer thin component of the stripped gas or some confinement mechanisms may narrow the morphology of the eigs .",
    "strong star formation activities can be seen in the bright knots in the eigs of rb199 and ic  4040 .",
    "yy08 suggested , based on @xmath11 , h@xmath0 and _ galex _ uv images , that the bright knots in the eig of rb199 are star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite found asymmetric uv emission for 13 galaxies in the coma center .",
    "they suggested that these emission regions were produced by active star formation in the stripped gas from their host galaxies .",
    "the sample of @xcite largely overlaps the eig sample presented by yy10 .",
    "although yy10 did not identify optical continuum counterparts for most of the eigs , @xcite pointed out that star formation activities are often associated with the eigs ( on the basis of their uv observations ) .",
    "recent numerical simulations of rps have predicted active star formation in the stripped gas @xcite .",
    "yy08 reported good morphological agreement between the bright knots of the eig of rb199 and the numerical simulation of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "although the spatial resolution of these simulations is insufficient to reproduce molecular gas formation in the stripped gas , @xcite recently found that molecular clouds can be condensed in the rps tails .",
    "they suggested that magnetic fields would play an important role in compressing the molecular clouds @xcite .     a @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 color - color diagram of the bright knots of the eig of rb199 and ic  4040 .",
    "green points and orange points represent the data of the rb199 knots and the ic  4040 knots , respectively .",
    "red line and blue dashed line show loci of star formation models ( using pegase.2 @xcite , see the text ) .",
    "both models assume that stars are formed by infalling gas , and the infall rate is assumed to be proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the timescale of the infall .",
    "we adopted @xmath34 myr .",
    "red line is the result of an exponentially decaying star formation model with a decay timescale of 100 myr .",
    "blue dashed line is the result of a constant star formation model . ]",
    "we compared the broad - band colors of the star - forming knots of rb199 ( knot 1 to knot 5 ) and ic  4040 ( s - k2 ) with star formation model .",
    "figure 23 is a @xmath30 versus @xmath35 color - color plot for the star - forming knots .",
    "the loci of star formation model calculations using pegase.2 @xcite are also plotted in the figure . in these calculations",
    ", we assumed that stars are formed by infalling of gas .",
    "the infall rate was assumed to be proportional to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the infall timescale .",
    "we adopted @xmath34 myr .",
    "we also assumed that the initial mass function ( imf ) follows salpeter imf from 0.1 m@xmath36 to 120 m@xmath36 , and the abundance of the infall gas is 0.6 @xmath16 .",
    "we did not include emission - line components in color calculation .",
    "figure 23 presents two cases ; an exponentially - decaying star formation model with a decay timescale of 100 myr , and a constant star formation model .",
    "yy08 showed similar plots for the rb199 knots .",
    "however , we found that the filter transmission functions of the @xmath6 uv bands adopted by yy08 were incorrect , and the predicted @xmath35 colors were significantly shifted to the blue direction",
    ". additionally , they did not subtract h@xmath0 emission contribution from the @xmath37 band data . in this work",
    ", we used the correct @xmath6 fuv band transmission curve @xcite to calculate fuv magnitude of the models , and the @xmath37 magnitudes from which the h@xmath0 emission flux was carefully subtracted based on our spectroscopy .",
    "figure 23 shows that the star - forming knots are very young , on the order of 100 myr .",
    "these bright knots are located at @xmath38 kpc from the parent galaxies with a current relative velocity of @xmath39 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "thus it would take at least @xmath23 myr for these knots to reach the current positions .",
    "this is comparable to or slightly shorter than the age estimation for the knots .",
    "however , the real travel time of the knots would be a few times longer than this value , because the knots are currently accelerated .",
    "together with the low metal abundance nature of the knots ( see section 3.2 ) , this thus suggests that the most part of the stellar component of these knots was formed in the stripped metal poor gas which originally resided in the outskirt of the parent galaxies .",
    "current active star formation associated with the knots also supports this idea . using hybrid n - body / hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", @xcite found that 95%  of stars newly formed by rps reside in the wake of stripped gas . in their simulations ,",
    "the timescale of star formation in the wakes is @xmath23 myr @xcite .",
    "the young age of the star - forming knots of the eigs suggested by our results is consistent with their findings .",
    "we found that an ionized gas cloud overlaps the line of sight to h@xmath0 cloud 2 of rb199 .",
    "this cloud has a radial velocity of 6500 km  s@xmath2 , which is much slower than that of the eig ( @xmath40 km  s@xmath2 ) and closer to the mean velocity of the coma cluster .",
    "it indicates that this overlapped cloud is kinematically independent with the eig .    what is this cloud and where did it originate ?",
    "one possibility is that it is a gas cloud stripped from a nearby galaxy .",
    "a candidate of the parent galaxy is an early type galaxy ( sdss j125844.32 + 274251.6 ) near h@xmath0 cloud 2 . according to the sdss database",
    ", the color of this galaxy is that of a typical of s0 galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the recession velocity of this galaxy is not known .",
    "no morphological indication suggests a physical connection between this galaxy and the overlapped cloud .",
    "we thus concluded that this galaxy is plausibly not the parent of the cloud .",
    "on the other hand , this cloud may be a remnant of a stripping event which occurred long ago . in this case , identifying the parent galaxy would be difficult because an apparent physical connection between them would be almost completely lost .",
    "recently , a huge intra - cluster stellar population has been found in local- and intermediate - redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "such population is thought to be originated by galaxy - galaxy interaction or merger in the central region of the clusters .",
    "tidal force associated with galaxy - galaxy interaction would strip the stars from the galaxies and spread them into the intra - cluster space .",
    "associated with these tidal stripping events , dense disk gas may be also stripped , and a dense gas cloud may be floating in the intra - cluster space .    although it is impossible to reach any conclusions from this rare example , this finding may suggest that there is a population of ` floating ionized gas ' in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "deep h@xmath0 imaging of intra - cluster space and spectroscopic follow up will reveal how common this kind of objects are in galaxy clusters .",
    "our spectroscopic observations showed that it is plausible that the eigs associated to the four galaxies , rb199 , ic  4040 , gmp  2923 and gmp  3071 , are formed by rps .",
    "the observations also made it clear that strong star formation occurs in some parts of the stripped gas .",
    "the eigs around galaxies in the coma cluster may act as a snapshot of a formation process of very faint galaxy population in clusters .",
    "the typical brightness and size of the bright knots in the eigs are @xmath41 and @xmath42 kpc ( corresponding half light radius @xmath43 pc ) , respectively , which are similar to those of ultra compact dwarf galaxies @xcite or small dwarf spheroidals .",
    "this suggests that the bright knots are gravitationally self - bound systems . in this case",
    ", they would survive and float in the halo of the parent galaxies or in the intra - cluster space of the coma .",
    "after the star formation ceased , the luminosities of the bright knots will significantly decrease . assuming the exponentially decaying star - formation model we used in section 5.2 , and assuming a typical age for the bright knots is 200 myr",
    ", we can conclude that the luminosities of the knots would decrease by @xmath44 magnitudes in @xmath10 band in 1 gyr .",
    "that is , the absolute magnitudes of the knots will eventually be @xmath45 .",
    "this luminosity range is within that of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local group @xcite .",
    "most of the stars of the eigs may be bound to the gravitational field of the parent galaxies .",
    "@xcite discussed that most of the stars formed in the stripped gas in their simulations are gravitationally bound to the host galaxy and will fall back to the galaxy within 1 gyr . in this case , the bright knots may be observed as features like ` galaxy aggregates ' identified in the coma cluster by @xcite in the fall - back process . because stellar systems are collision - less ones , the stars will penetrate the galaxy disk and oscillate between two sides of the disk .",
    "accordingly , the bright knots and the blue filaments will eventually be destroyed and distributed widely in the galaxy halo ; in other words , the knots would form the halo population of the galaxy .    however",
    ", our spectroscopy revealed that the ionized gas of the knots has the relative velocity of @xmath46 km  s@xmath2 ( table 3 ) . because the stellar components of the knots are closely associated with the ionized gas",
    ", the stars would have almost the same velocity as the ionized gas . in this case , the knots probably escape from the gravitational potential of the parent galaxies and float into the intra - cluster space . in this context , it is interesting to note that an intra - cluster h  ii region was found in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of deep imaging and spectroscopic observations of very extended ionized gas ( eig ) around four member galaxies of the coma cluster , rb199 , ic  4040 , gmp  2923 and gmp  3071 . among them , the bright eig around ic  4040 is remarkable and has complex morphology .",
    "it consists of two streams extending towards the southeast and southern directions from the galaxy .",
    "the southeast stream is connected to the central active star formation region .",
    "many small ionized clouds are distributed between the southern stream and ic  4040 .",
    "several star - forming blue knots are embedded in the eigs of rb199 and ic  4040 .",
    "the extension of the eigs ranges from @xmath47 kpc to @xmath48 kpc .",
    "the relative radial velocities of the eigs with respect to the systemic velocity of the parent galaxies from which they emanate increase almost monotonically with the distance from the nucleus of the respective galaxies , reaching @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 at around @xmath3 kpc from the galaxies .",
    "the velocity decreasing rates are @xmath49 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 for rb199 , ic  4040 and gmp  2923 .",
    "the gmp  3079 eig has the steepest velocity gradient of @xmath50 km  s@xmath2  kpc@xmath2 .",
    "the kinematics of the eigs is consistent with the concept that high - speed collisions between the intra - cluster medium and infalling galaxies of the coma cluster form these features , because all the sample galaxies have systemic velocities much higher than the mean recession velocity of the cluster .",
    "we obtained a detailed velocity field for the bright eig of ic  4040 .",
    "the velocity dispersions of the diffuse filaments of the ic  4040 eig reach @xmath51 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we also found a very low velocity filament at the southeastern edge of the disk of ic  4040 .",
    "the filament has a velocity of @xmath52 km  s@xmath2 relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "some of the bright compact knots in the eigs of rb199 and ic  4040 have blue continuum and strong h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the equivalent widths of the h@xmath0 emission of the knots range @xmath53  .",
    "the emission line intensity ratios of the knots are basically consistent with those of sub - solar abundance regions .",

    "the morphologies and velocity fields of the eigs are broadly consistent with those predicted by numerical simulations of ram pressure stripping .",
    "our spectroscopic observations did not cover the entire regions of the eigs due to spatial limitation of slits .",
    "this prevented us from making detailed comparison between the observation and the simulations .",
