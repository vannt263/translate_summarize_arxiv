    "quantum teleportation @xcite is a typical quantum information processing task , which functions as transferring a quantum state from one site to another one via previously shared entanglement assisted by classical communications and local operations .",
    "quantum teleportation can not only be directly used to realize quantum communication but also construct a primitive of a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation has been realized in many experiments ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . since the end of last century",
    ", a new quantum teleportation idea , i.e. , controlled teleportation ( ct ) , has been attracting much interest @xcite .",
    "ct functions as teleporting a quantum state from a sender s ( alice ) site to a receiver s ( bob ) site under the control of multiple supervisors ( charlie 1 , charlie 2,@xmath3 ) . in other words ,",
    "alice and bob need the cooperation of charlies in order to realize the teleportation ( communication ) successfully .",
    "a ct scheme has already been demonstrated in an optical experiment @xcite .",
    "ct is useful in the context of networked quantum communication , quantum computation , and cryptographic conference @xcite .",
    "for instance , ct can be used as a secret sharing to hide a quantum state as a secret @xcite .",
    "in addition , ct has many similarities with the secure multi - party quantum computation ( mpqc ) protocol @xcite which allows multiple players to compute an agreed quantum circuit where each player has access only to his own quantum input .",
    "a mpqc protocol has two phases , sharing phase and reconstruction phase . in the sharing phase , dealers provide many agents with their initial state ; in the reconstruction phase , one agent is designated to reconstruct the final state of the protocol with the help of the other ones .",
    "ct may have other interesting applications , such as in opening a credit account on the agreement of multiple managers in a quantum network .",
    "the previous ct schemes @xcite are focused on the ( @xmath1 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling schemes where the achievement of teleportation is conditioned on the collaboration of all the supervisors . in other words , it is impossible to realize teleportation between alice and bob if anyone of charlies does not cooperate for subjective or objective reasons . however",
    ", a more general ct scheme should consider the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold case ( @xmath2 ) where @xmath0 or more of the supervisors can help bob successfully recover the transferred state , but less than @xmath0 of them can not .",
    "recently , different ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling schemes were discussed in refs .",
    "the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite needs lowering the fidelity of teleportation and its successful probability for enduring the uncooperation of part of supervisors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors pointed out that a ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can be constructed by using secret sharing .",
    "that is , the teleportation is controlled by a classical key which is shared by the supervisors such that @xmath0 or more of them can recover the key . however , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , a classical key can be easily copied , and charlies can not stop bob from recovering alice s original state if bob manages to obtain as least @xmath0 shares of the key without consent of charlies .",
    "more importantly , the classical ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can not prevent charlies cheats as will be shown .",
    "they also proposed another `` ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold '' ct scheme which is a combination of a ( @xmath1 , @xmath1)-threshold ct scheme and the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold secret sharing scheme mentioned above . evidently , it is not a genuine ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme , because bob still needs the assistance of all the supervisors for recovering alice s original state . in principle , a ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can be constructed by using the quantum polynomial codes @xcite as mentioned in ref .",
    "however , it needs the supervisors and bob to come together and perform nonlocal operations ( multi - particle joint operations ) .    in this article",
    ", we propose genuine ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling schemes for ct . in these schemes ,",
    "the supervisors ( charlies ) only need to perform single - particle measurements and announce their outcomes . if the recipient receives @xmath0 correct outcomes , he or she can reconstruct the original state that the sender wants to transfer by appropriate local operations .",
    "we first consider the ct of a single - particle state via a multipartite entangled sate .",
    "then the ct of an @xmath4-particle state can be directly realized by using @xmath4 such multipartite entangled states .",
    "however , the directly generalized method requires considerably large auxiliary particle resources and local operations , as well as classical communications , especially when @xmath4 is very large .",
    "we propose a much more economical scheme for ct of an arbitrary @xmath4-particle state with a single multipartite entangled state . by construction ,",
    "our quantum channels are genuine multipartite entangled states in which any two parts are inseparable .",
    "their properties are compared and contrasted with those of the well - known greenberger - horne - zeilinger , w , and linear cluster states , and also several other genuine multipartite entangled states recently introduced in literature .",
    "we show that our schemes are secure against both bob s dishonesty and supervisors treacheries . for the latter case ,",
    "the game theory is utilized to prove that supervisors cheats can be well prevented .",
    "in addition to the potential applications in networked quantum communication and quantum computation , our schemes are also useful in seeking and exploring genuine multipartite entangled states and opening another perspective for the applications of the game theory in quantum information science .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct protocols , and briefly analyze the features of the entanglement channels . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the security of our schemes against bob s dishonesty and supervisors treacheries . concluding remarks appear in sec .",
    "quantum teleportation was first proposed by bennett _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in their original scheme ,",
    "the state to be teleported is an arbitrary single - particle state given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 , and the quantum channel shared by the sender alice and the receiver bob is an epr singlet state .",

    "assume that there is a community which is composed of @xmath20 members , alice , bob , charlie 1 , charlie 2 , @xmath3 , and charlie @xmath1 .",
    "the members are distributed in a network and connected by a quantum channel , i.e. , a multipartite entangled state , and one or more classical channels ( can be considered as the conventional classical communication facilities ) .",
    "one of alice and bob is the sender of a quantum state ( the carrier of quantum information ) , and the other one is the receiver .",
    "charlies act as the supervisors who can decide whether or not to allow alice and bob to carry out the teleportation . in a word ,",
    "the teleportation of a quantum state between alice and bob is supervised by charlies and needs their approval . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume alice is the sender and bob is the receiver . in order to realize the ct of the single - particle state @xmath21 ,",
    "the quantum channel shared by them can be in the form of @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are normalized and their forms depend on the concrete schemes but should satisfy @xmath25 and can be distinguished by local measurements and classical communications . here",
    ", particle @xmath15 belongs to alice , particle @xmath16 to bob , and particle @xmath26 to charlie @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it has been shown in the above subsection that anyone of the four bell states can be competent for realizing the teleportation of the state @xmath21 .",
    "however , alice and bob can carry out the teleportation only if they can ascertain which bell state their subsystem is in . with the quantum channel @xmath29",
    ", the identification of the bell states can be achieved by the following method : charlies make measurements with appropriate bases on their own particles and inform bob the outcomes ; then bob can distinguish the states @xmath30 and thus can identify the bell states .",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath31 and @xmath32 is clearly shown in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . without the cooperation of charlies",
    ", the subsystem of alice and bob will be in the mixed state @xmath33 .",
    "the mixed state can not be used to implement perfect teleportation @xcite .    in the conventional ct schemes which use the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz)-type entangled states @xcite as the quantum channel , two terms of @xmath34",
    "are set to zero , and the other two are not and their corresponding @xmath35 states are different dicke states . for example , the quantum channel @xmath29 is a ghz state @xmath36 , then @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] , and @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 $ ] ( @xmath43 ) is the combinational coefficient , @xmath44 denotes that @xmath45 particles are in the state @xmath46 and @xmath47 particles are in the state @xmath48 , and when @xmath1 is odd @xmath49 , otherwise , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "that is , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the dicke states with even @xmath46 and odd @xmath46 , respectively . thus charlies can perform single - particle measurements on their own particles with the basis @xmath54 and inform bob the outcomes , and bob can identify the bell states with the outcomes , even or odd @xmath46 .",
    "evidently , such a ct scheme is a ( @xmath1 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme , i.e. , alice and bob can implement the teleportation if and only if all charlies agree and cooperate .",
    "now , let us move on to the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme .",
    "for simplicity , we first consider the case @xmath55 .",
    "that is , alice and bob can realize successfully teleportation if anyone of charlies cooperate with them .",
    "we can set @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "then the quantum channel is @xmath58 it can be seen that if anyone of charlies performs a measurement on his particle with the basis @xmath59 ( i.e. , in the @xmath60 direction ) and informs bob the outcome , bob can know particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 are in the bell state @xmath12 for the outcome @xmath61 or @xmath62 for @xmath63 . in other words ,",
    "anyone of charlies suffices to help alice and bob achieve the teleportation of the state @xmath21 .",
    "however , if all of charlies do not collaborate with them , they can not achieve the teleportation .",
    "note that any combination of @xmath64 with two of the four bell states can construct a quantum channel which can realize the ( 1 , @xmath1)-threshold ct mentioned above .",
    "for instance , we can also construct a suitable quantum channel by setting @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath68 , the quantum channel can be constructed as @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] is the combinational coefficient , @xmath71 denotes all the totally symmetric states including @xmath72 zeros and @xmath73 ones .",
    "for example , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then @xmath76 . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath77 is then a symmetric dicke state with @xmath73 excitations . by the way , the symmetric six - qubit dicke state with three excitations has recently been realized in experiment @xcite .",
    "note that when @xmath55 , the state of eq .",
    "( [ phik ] ) reduces to that of eq .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) .",
    "we consider that @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) of charlies perform single - particle measurements on their own particles with the basis @xmath80 .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "( a ) @xmath81 , if all of them get the outcome @xmath61 , the subsystem of particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 collapses into @xmath12 , otherwise , it collapses into @xmath62 .",
    "( b ) @xmath82 , if all of them get the outcome @xmath61 , the subsystem of particles @xmath15 and @xmath16 collapses into a mixed state of @xmath12 and @xmath62 .",
    "thus we can conclude that @xmath0 or more of charlies can help alice and bob deterministically distinguish between the two bell states @xmath12 and @xmath62 , while less than @xmath0 of them can not .",
    "in other words , alice can deterministically teleport the state @xmath83 to bob if and only if @xmath0 or more of charlies collaborate with them .",
    "the procedure of such a ct protocol is as follows .",
    "\\(i ) alice performs a bell - basis measurement on particles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and informs bob the outcome , one of @xmath84 .",
    "\\(ii ) bob sends his petition to charlies .",
    "( iii)charlies talk over whether or not to allow bob to recover the original state of alice s particle @xmath14 .",
    "if more than a certain number of charlies ( e.g. , @xmath85 of them ) vote for allowing , a collective decision should be made that permitting bob to recover alice s original state . then all charlies should perform single - particle measurements on their own particles with the basis @xmath59 and broadcast their outcomes .",
    "\\(iv ) according to alice s and charlies measurement outcomes , bob performs a corresponding pauli rotation on particle @xmath16 and recovers alice s original state on it .",
    "note that we need all of charlies instead of @xmath0 of them to broadcast their outcomes in step ( iii ) is based on the consideration that there may exist treacherous charlies who will cheat bob and send him the false measurement outcomes .",
    "the detailed proof for the security of our scheme against charlies cheats will be given in sec .",
    "iii .      as a direct generalization of the teleportation of a single - particle state , teleportation of an arbitrary @xmath4-particle state @xmath86 can be achieved with @xmath4 bell states .",
    "in fact , the teleportation of a two - particle state with two bell states has already been demonstrated in an optical experiment @xcite .",
    "thus , one can use @xmath4 copies of the state of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) to realize the ct of an arbitrary @xmath4-particle state .",
    "also , we can directly use @xmath4 copies of the state @xmath87 or @xmath88 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ phi1 ] ) and ( [ phik ] ) ] to accomplish the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct of @xmath89 .",
    "however , this method requires considerably large auxiliary particle resources and local operations , as well as classical communications , especially when the number of `` teleported '' qubits is very large .",
    "particularly , each charlie needs to hold @xmath4 controlling particles , perform @xmath4 single - particle measurements , and send bob @xmath4 bits of classical information about the measurement outcomes .",
    "we now propose a much more economical way to implement the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct of an arbitrary @xmath4-particle state .",
    "the quantum channel is the multipartite entangled state @xmath90 where particles @xmath91 are held by alice , @xmath92 held by bob . in order to successfully implement the teleportation ,",
    "alice and bob need charlies to help them identify the two sequences of bell states . particularly , the procedure is as follows .",
    "\\(i ) alice performs a sequence of bell - basis measurements on the pairs of particles @xmath93 , and informs bob the outcomes .",
    "\\(ii ) and ( iii ) are the same as that of the ct protocol for a single - particle state .",
    "\\(iii ) according to alice s and charlies measurement outcomes , bob applies the corresponding pauli rotations on particles @xmath94 and reconstructs the state of eq .",
    "( [ psitn ] ) .    as shown above",
    ", regardless of the number of qubits to be teleported , the proposed approach only requires that each supervisor holds one particle , performs one single - particle measurement on his or her particle , and send one bit of classical message to the receiver bob .",
    "therefore , compared with the directly generalized method mentioned above , this method is much more economical , because the required auxiliary particle resources , the number of measurements , and the quantity of classical communications are greatly reduced .",
    "we notice that any two of the four bell states can be distinguished by local ( single - particle ) measurements with appropriate measurement bases and classical communications .",
    "for instance , we can distinguish between the two sets @xmath95 and @xmath96 by using the measurement basis @xmath59 , which can be evidently seen from eq .",
    "( [ bell ] ) . in order to show how to distinguish between the two sets @xmath97 and @xmath98 by local measurements and classical communication , we rewrite them as @xmath99 obviously",
    ", if two participants perform , respectively , a single - particle measurement on different particles with the basis @xmath54 , they can discriminate between the two sets @xmath97 and @xmath98 by exchanging the outcomes .",
    "that is , if their outcomes are anticorrelated , the state of the whole system is initially in the set @xmath98 , otherwise , it is in the set @xmath97 . with this method ,",
    "alice and bob can measure anyone of @xmath4 pairs of particles @xmath100 and identify the states of the other @xmath101 pairs of particles in the quantum channel of eq .",
    "( [ phik2 nm ] ) .",
    "then alice and bob can realize the teleportation of an @xmath4-particle state with a high fidelity when @xmath4 is large , out of the control of charlies . especially , when the @xmath4-particle state @xmath89 [ see eq .",
    "( [ psitn ] ) ] is separable , such as @xmath102 , alice and bob can realize perfect teleportation of @xmath101 qubits information escaping from the control of charlies .",
    "however , this drawback can be avoided by the following methods .",
    "we can establish two sequences of states chosen from the four bell states for the @xmath4 pairs of particles @xmath103 , and make one - to - one correspondence between them and the two states @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "that is , we can use the following entangled state , instead of @xmath106 , to act as the quantum channel : @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) @xmath110 or @xmath111 .",
    "note that alice and bob can know the @xmath4 pairs of particles @xmath103 are in the sequence of states @xmath112 or @xmath113 if and only if they know the particles @xmath114 are in the state @xmath115 or @xmath105 by charlies help .",
    "in other words , they can not ascertain which sequence of states the subsystem of their @xmath4 pairs of particles is in without the cooperation of charlies .",
    "the teleportation of an arbitrary @xmath4-particle state can also be implemented by using a genuine @xmath116-particle entangled state as shown in refs .",

    "then there is no any correlation among particles @xmath184 .",
    "this case can be can be easily found by charlies .",
    "if bob sends other @xmath1 auxiliary particles in a ghz state @xmath186 to charlies , the correlation between the subsystem of alice and bob and that of charlies is destroyed .",
    "thus such an action of bob can also be detected .",
    "in fact , the correlation of any genuine multipartite entangled state will be disturbed or destroyed by any measurement on a subspace of it , and can not be perfectly simulated by another entangled state involving less parties . as a consequence ,",
    "bob s dishonest action can always be detected in our schemes .",
    "the detailed proof is so complicated and prolix , and will be given elsewhere .",
    "note that charlies should randomly choose a sufficient subset of quantum channels to check whether particles are intercepted during the distribution before carrying out the task of ct .",
    "the security checking process is similar to that of quantum secret sharing schemes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . as a matter of fact ,",
    "most of quantum communication schemes need ones to use this method to check the security of quantum channels against eavesdropper s interception .",
    "also , all the previous ct schemes @xcite are secure against bob s dishonesty if checking the security of quantum channels before carrying out the corresponding tasks",
    ".      when some charlies are not satisfied with a collective decision , they may betray the community by three possible ways as follows .",
    "( a ) they privately help bob to reconstruct alice s original state .",
    "( b ) they reject cooperating with bob and making measurements on their particles .",
    "( c ) they cheat bob and send him the false measurement outcomes .",
    "we assume that any classical communication is open and insecure , and treacherous charlies will be punished if their treacherous actions are detected",
    ". then cases ( a ) and ( b ) will not occur . in the following ,",
    "we show how case ( c ) can be prevented .",
    "we first consider that there is only one treacherous charlie , e.g. , charlie @xmath27 , who cheats bob and sends him the false measurement outcome .",
    "that is , when charlie @xmath27 gets the measurement outcome @xmath61 he broadcasts @xmath63 , when getting @xmath63 he broadcasts @xmath61 .",
    "there are two cases .",
    "case one : @xmath149 . if the real measurement outcome on the subsystem of particles @xmath179 is @xmath187 , then the broadcasted outcome is @xmath188 because charlie @xmath27 announced the opposite outcome .",
    "however , such an outcome should not appear when there is no treacherous charlie .",
    "thus the cheat action of charlie @xmath27 is exposed .",
    "if the real measurement outcome is one term of @xmath105 involving @xmath72 zeros and @xmath73 ones , then the broadcasted outcome involves @xmath189 or @xmath0 zeros . in this case",
    ", bob can also find that there exists a betrayer , although he can not directly know which charlie cheated him . in a word , bob can always detect whether or not there exist treacherous charlies who cheat him .",
    "the probability of exactly finding the cheat action of charlie @xmath27 is @xmath190 .",
    "case two : @xmath157 .",
    "if the real measurement outcome is @xmath187 or @xmath191 , the broadcasted outcome is @xmath191 or @xmath187 .",
    "then the cheat action of charlie @xmath27 can not be found and bob will obtain a wrong state instead of alice s original state . if the real measurement outcome is @xmath192 , then the broadcasted outcome is @xmath193 .",
    "however , such an outcome should not appear when there is no treacherous charlie .",
    "thus bob can find that there exists a betrayer . in a nutshell ,",
    "the probability of finding the existence of treacherous charlie is @xmath194 .",
    "note that they may randomly broadcast an artificial outcome without measurement .",
    "this way has no essential differences with the one discussed above .    for the case where there are @xmath78 ( @xmath195 ) treacherous charlies who send the false outcomes to bob , when @xmath196 , the probability of finding the treacherous charlies is one ( @xmath78 is odd ) or @xmath197 ( @xmath78 is even ) ; when @xmath198 , the probability is @xmath199 ( @xmath78 is odd ) or @xmath200 ( @xmath78 is even ) .    according to the above analysis , when there is only one charlie who cheats bob and sends him the false measurement outcome , his cheat action can be directly detected with probability @xmath190 . because when the cheat action of any one of charlies is found , he will be chastised , the case where one or more charlies cheat bob will not occur in practice .",
    "we now prove it by the game theory @xcite .",
    "assume that there are @xmath78 potential treacherous charlies who are not satisfied with a collective decision that permitting bob to reconstruct alice s original state .",
    "they will play a multi - player _ prisoners - dilemma - like _ game .",
    "the so - called prisoners dilemma game @xcite is as follows .",
    "two or more perpetrators are caught by the police and are interrogated in separate cells _ without communication among them_. unfortunately , the police lacks enough proof to implead them .",
    "the chief policeman now makes the following offer to each prisoner : if one of them confesses to the crime , but the others do not , then he or she will be commuted by @xmath201 years and the others will increase @xmath201 years ; if all of them deny , then each of them will be commuted by @xmath202 years ( @xmath203 ) ; if all of them confess , then everyone will be commuted by @xmath204 years ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "the objective of each player ( prisoner ) is to maximize his or her individual payoff .",
    "the catch of the dilemma is that confessing ( i.e. , they defect from each other ) is the dominant strategy , that is , rational reasoning forces each player to defect , and thereby doing substantially worse than if they would all decide to cooperate ( deny ) . in terms of the game theory ,",
    "such a mutual defection is a nash equilibrium @xcite because each of the players comes to the conclusion that he or she could not have done better by unilaterally changing his or her own strategy . in our scheme , if one of the potential treacherous charlies sends bob the false outcome , and the others do not , he will be detected and chastised and they will achieve their purpose of preventing bob from recovering alice s original state ; if two or more of them send false outcomes , they can accomplish their purpose escaping from penalty ; if all of them do not send false outcome , each will not be punished but they can not achieve their aim .",
    "thus each of potential treacherous charlies wish their partners but not himself to send the false outcomes , because then he can accomplish his purpose but not be chastised . the rational reasoning and selfish gene force each charlie to send correct outcome .",
    "this decision is a nash equilibrium because each of charlies could not do better by unilaterally changing his action .    in a word ,",
    "our schemes are secure against charlies cheats .",
    "it is worth pointing out that all previous ct schemes @xcite , including the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , are insecure when there exist treacherous charlies .",
    "that is , the cheat action of charlies can not be detected .",
    "then bob may obtain a wrong state with very low fidelity instead of alice s original state when one or more charlies send him the false measurement outcomes .",
    "for instance , we consider the ct of a single - particle state @xmath21 [ see eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) ] with a standard ghz state . when there are odd charlies who send the false measurement outcomes to bob , he will get a wrong state with only the fidelity @xmath206 .",
    "in summary , we have proposed several ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling schemes for ct , where the teleportation of a quantum state alice to bob is under the control of @xmath1 charlies such that @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) or more of them can help bob successfully recover the transferred state .",
    "we have also shown that our schemes are secure against both bob s dishonesty and charlies treacheries . however",
    ", previous ( @xmath1 , @xmath1)-threshold schemes can not prevent charlies cheats .",
    "the presented schemes have potential applications in networked quantum information processing .",
    "for example , they can be used to implement the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold quantum - secret - sharing without nonlocal operation among receivers and additional limitation for @xmath0 , following the idea of ref .",
    "our schemes are also useful to seek and explore genuine multipartite entangled states .",
    "we utilized the game theory to prove the security of our schemes against charlies cheats .",
    "this implies that our schemes may open another perspective for the applications of the game theory .",
    "although we only discussed the case where the quantum channels are pure entangled states , suitable mixed entangled states may also be competent for the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct .",
    "in fact , the general form of the pure - entangled - state channel of eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) can be replaced by the mixed - state channel @xmath207 then corresponding mixed - state channels of the ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct can be constructed by the same methods as in sec .",
    "ii b and sec .",
    "ii c. with the forms of the states of eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ rho ] ) , one can construct different quantum channels for implementing ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold ct .",
    "note that all the quantum channels should at least satisfy the following conditions .",
    "( a ) they are symmetric under permutation of qubits @xmath208 .",
    "( b ) the four states @xmath209 can not be fully distinguished unless @xmath0 of supervisors perform single - particle measurements on their own particles with appropriate bases and combine the measurement outcomes .",
    "in addition , different methods may be needed to discuss the security of concrete schemes .",
    "as mentioned above , saitoh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also proposed a `` ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold '' ct scheme which is a combination of a ( @xmath1 , @xmath1)-threshold ct scheme and a ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold secret sharing scheme . in their scheme , however , the receiver bob still needs receiving all of the supervisors correct measurement outcomes , i.e. , needs the cooperation of all charlies , for recovering the teleported state .",
    "thus their scheme is not a genuine ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme and can not prevent charlies cheats .",
    "they also mentioned that a ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can be constructed by sharing a classical key among charlies such that @xmath0 or more of them can recover the key .",
    "the distribution of the key can be achieved by quantum cryptography .",
    "however , they did not construct a concrete scheme .",
    "in addition , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a classical key can be easily copied , and charlies can not stop bob from recovering alice s original state if bob manages to obtain as least @xmath0 shares of the key without consent of charlies .",
    "more importantly , the classical ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can not prevent charlies cheats . in principle , a ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)-threshold controlling scheme can be constructed by using the quantum polynomial codes @xcite as mentioned in ref .",
    "however , it needs charlies and bob to come together and perform nonlocal operations ( multi - particle operations ) .",
    "in contrast , our schemes do not need performing nonlocal operations and are secure against charlies cheats of sending false measurement outcomes . +",
