    "in this paper we present new theoretical mass - loss rates @xmath0 for a wide range of parameters for galactic o and b stars , taking _ multiple scattering _ into account . these predictions for @xmath0",
    "are compared with observations .",
    "the goal of the paper is to derive an accurate description of mass loss as a function of stellar parameters .",
    "early - type stars have high mass - loss rates , which substantially affects their evolution ( e.g. chiosi & maeder 1986 ) . the winds of early - type stars are most likely driven by radiation pressure in lines and in the continuum .",
    "the radiation - driven wind theory was first developed by lucy & solomon ( 1970 ) and castor et al .",
    "( 1975 ) ( hereafter cak ) . at a later stage",
    "the theory was improved by abbott ( 1982 ) , friend & abbott ( 1986 ) , pauldrach et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and kudritzki et al .",
    "( 1989 ) .    during the last decade ,",
    "the radiation - driven wind theory has been compared with the most reliable mass - loss determinations from observations that are available : mass loss determined from radio data and from the analysis of h@xmath1 line profiles .",
    "both lamers & leitherer ( 1993 ) and puls et al .",
    "( 1996 ) came to the conclusion that the theory of radiation - driven winds shows a _ systematic discrepancy _ with the observations . for o stars the radiation - driven wind theory predicts systematically _",
    "lower _ values for mass loss than have been derived from observations .",
    "since the discrepancy increases as a function of wind density , it is possible that the reason for this is an inadequate treatment of `` multiple scattering '' in the current state of radiation - driven wind theory .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. by lamers & leitherer 1993 ) that the `` momentum - problem '' that has been observed in the dense winds of wolf - rayet stars is the more extreme appearance of this discrepancy seen in the winds of normal o - type stars .    because the observed mass - loss rates for o type supergiants are typically a factor of two higher than the values predicted by radiation - driven wind theory , evolutionary models would be significantly affected if theoretical values were adopted .",
    "it is obvious that an accurate description of mass loss is of great importance to construct reliable evolutionary tracks for massive stars .",
    "abbott & lucy ( 1985 ) and puls ( 1987 ) have investigated the importance of `` multiple scattering '' relative to `` single scattering '' for the winds of o stars .",
    "abbott & lucy found an increase in @xmath0 of a factor of about three for the wind of the o supergiant @xmath2 puppis if multiple scattering was applied in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "we will use a similar monte carlo technique in which multiple scatterings are taken into account to calculate mass - loss rates for a wide range of stellar parameters throughout the upper part of the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) . in sect .",
    "[ s_method ] , the approach to calculate mass - loss rates will be briefly described , while in sect .",
    "[ s_massloss ] , a grid of wind models and mass - loss rates will be presented .",
    "a clear separation of the hrd into two parts will be made .",
    "the first range is that on the `` hot '' side of the _ bi - stability _ jump near spectral type b1 , where the ratio of the terminal velocity to the effective escape velocity at the stellar surface ( @xmath3 ) is about 2.6 ; the second range is that on the `` cool '' side of the jump where the ratio suddenly drops to about 1.3 ( lamers et al .",
    "1995 ) . at the jump the mass - loss rate",
    "is predicted to change dramatically due to a drastic change in the ionization of the wind ( vink et al .",
    "1999 ) . in sect .",
    "[ s_eta ] , the theoretical wind momentum will be studied and in sect .",
    "[ s_recipe ] fitting formulae for the mass - loss rate will be derived by means of multiple linear regression methods : this yields a recipe to predict @xmath0 as a function of stellar parameters . in sect .",
    "[ s_comp ] these predicted mass - loss rates will be compared with observational rates .",
    "_ we will show that for o stars theory and observations agree if `` multiple scattering '' is properly taken into account .",
    "_ finally , in sects .",
    "[ s_disc ] and  [ s_concl ] the study will be discussed and summarized .",
    "the basic physical properties of the adopted monte carlo ( mc ) method to predict mass - loss rates are similar to the technique introduced by abbott & lucy ( 1985 ) .",
    "the precise method was extensively described in vink et al .",
    "the core of the approach is that the total loss of radiative energy is linked to the total gain of momentum of the outflowing material .",
    "the momentum deposition in the wind is calculated by following the fate of a large number of photons that are released from below the photosphere .",
    "the calculation of mass loss by this method requires the input of a model atmosphere , before the radiative acceleration and  can be calculated .",
    "the model atmospheres used for this study are calculated with the most recent version of the non - lte unified improved sobolev approximation code ( isa - wind ) for stars with extended atmospheres . for details",

    "since there are significantly less lines at roughly @xmath36 1800   than at shorter wavelength , the line acceleration becomes less effective at lower @xmath37 , and thus @xmath0 decreases .      between about @xmath38 and 22  500 k the situation",

    "the jump in mass loss around @xmath4 @xmath39 25  000 k is not exactly the same for all series of models : the jump occurs at somewhat different effective temperatures .",
    "this is no surprise , since the ionization equilibrium does not only depend on temperature , but on density as well .",

    "the characteristic densities and effective temperatures for the cool side of the jump are indicated with `` diamond '' signs and with `` plus '' signs for the hot side .",
    "as expected , for all 12 models the minimum @xmath23 corresponds to a relatively low @xmath44 and relatively high @xmath4 , whereas the maximum @xmath23 corresponds to a relatively high @xmath44 , but low @xmath4 .",
    "note that the effective temperature at minimum and maximum mass loss is not a very smooth function of wind density .",

    "( 1994 ) also use a unified method for the calculation of the occupation numbers , but a `` core - halo''approach is applied with respect to the line force .",
    "additionally , as line overlap is neglected in the method used by pauldrach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , these models can overestimate the line force as unattenuated photospheric flux is offered to each line , which consequently may produce efficiency numbers larger than unity .",
    "puls ( 1987 ) found that for winds of relatively low density ( say @xmath61 ) the inclusion of multi - line effects leads to a reduction of wind momentum _ compared to the standard model _ due to backscattering and blocking of photons in the lower part of the wind . for winds of relatively high density ( say @xmath62 ) , such as the dense winds of wolf - rayet stars , the situation is likely to be reversed . here",
    "momentum transfer from an extended diffuse field is expected to dominate over the effect of the attenuation of flux in the layers just above the photosphere .",
    "this could result in more mass loss compared to the standard radiation driven wind theory ( abbott & lucy 1985 , springmann 1994 ) .",
    "wolf - rayet and of / wn stars profit from a layered ionization structure , which increases the number of lines that can be used for the driving and thus increasing the mass loss ( lucy & abbott 1993 , de koter et al .",

    "our method differs in almost all aspects from that of pauldrach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in our method , photosphere and wind are treated in a unified manner ( 1 ) and we properly take multi - scatterings into account with a monte carlo technique ( 2 ) . on the other hand , we derive the level populations of the iron - group elements using ( a sophisticated version of ) the nebular approximation ( 3 ) .",

    "this demonstrates that an adequate treatment of `` multiple scattering '' in radiation - driven wind models resolves the discrepancy between observations and theory that had been reported earlier .",
    "the agreement between observed and theoretical wind momenta of o stars adds support to the method of deriving distances to distant stellar systems using the wlr .    the comparison between the predicted and observed values of the modified wind momentum @xmath72 for the b stars is not conclusive .",
    "a good comparison between the observations and our predictions for the b star regime needs to await an explanation of the discrepancies in the observed b star mass - loss rates .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a separate study .",
    "our models predict a jump in mass loss of about a factor of five around spectral type b1 . an important point that supports this prediction is the following .",
    "vink et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have calculated the mass - loss rate and @xmath24 for winds at both sides of the bi - stability jump in a self - consistent way for models with log(l/@xmath12 ) = 5.0 and m = 20  @xmath7 .",
    "these self - consistent calculations showed a jump in @xmath0 of a factor of five and a simultaneous drop in @xmath3 of a factor of two .",
    "this drop in @xmath3 has been _ observed _ ( lamers et al .",
    "this gives support to our prediction that the mass - loss rate at spectral type b1 increases by the predicted amount .",
    "since there is good agreement between observed mass - loss rates by different methods and the new theoretical mass - loss rates for the o - type stars , whereas there is inconsistency between the observed mass - loss rates from different authors for the b - type stars , this may point to the presence of systematic errors in mass - loss determinations from observations for b stars .",
    "because our predictions for the o stars agree with observations and our models also predict the bi - stability jump around spectral type b1 , we believe that our theoretical mass - loss predictions are reliable and suggest they be used in new evolutionary calculations of massive stars .",
    "1 .   we have calculated a grid of wind models and mass - loss rates for a wide range of stellar parameters , corresponding to masses between 15 and 120 @xmath7 .",
    "we have derived two fitting formulae for the mass - loss rates in two ranges in @xmath4 at either side of the bi - stability jump around 25  000 k. a mass - loss recipe was derived that connects the two fitting formulae at the bi - stability jump .",
    "3 .   there is good agreement between our mass - loss predictions that take _ multiple scattering _ into account , and the observations for the o stars .",
    "there is no systematic difference between predicted and observed mass - loss rates .",
    "4 .   a comparison between observed and predicted wind momenta of o - type stars also shows there is good agreement . this adds support to the use of the wlr as a way to derive distances to luminous o stars in distant stellar systems . 5 .   for the observed mass - loss rates of b stars",
    "there is an inconsistency between rates derived by different authors and/or methods .",
    "one group of @xmath0 determinations of b stars does follow the theoretical relationship , while another group does not .",
    "this lack of agreement between the observed mass - loss rates of b stars may point to systematic errors in the observed values .",
    "since our new theoretical mass - loss formalism is successful in explaining the observed mass - loss rates for o - type stars , as well as in predicting the location ( in @xmath4 ) and size ( in @xmath3 ) of the observed bi - stability jump , we believe that our predictions are reliable and suggest that our recipe be used in new evolutionary calculations for massive stars .",
