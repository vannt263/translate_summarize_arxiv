    "the @xmath0cdm framework offers a simple description of the properties of our universe with a very small number of free parameters .",
    "it reproduces remarkably well a wealth of high quality observations which allow to determine with high precision the few parameters describing the model ( typically below 5% in most of the parameters  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , more than fifteen years after the establishment of the accelerated expansion of the universe  @xcite , the @xmath0cdm cosmological model remains the current standard model in cosmology .",
    "however , the dark contents of the universe remain largely unidentified : no direct detection of a dark matter particle has been achieved , and the theoretical basis of the observed cosmological constant is not clearly established , especially with respect to the issue of gravitational effects of quantum vacuum energy ( the cosmological constant problem @xmath1see @xcite for an extended review ) . in this context , a large variety of explanations have been proposed beyond a simple einstein cosmological constant : scalar field domination known as quintessence  @xcite , generalized gravity theory beyond general relativity  @xcite or even inhomogeneous cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "an extensive review on constraints on cosmological models with the euclid satellite can be found in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has already been noticed that the pressureless ( cold ) nature of dark matter itself is not firmly established  @xcite . finally , even the separation of the dark sector in physically independent components such as a dark matter component and a dark energy may not be relevant with cosmological observations alone  @xcite . in this paper , we examine the consequences of considering non - pressureless dark matter when constraining the dark energy sector , with present - day observations and in the context of the future euclid survey mission .",
    "we focus on the simplest models , both for the dark matter and the dark energy sectors .",
    "namely , we assume constant equation of state for both sectors : @xmath2 for the dark matter sector ( @xmath3 implies that the dark matter component has some pressure ) , and @xmath4 for the dark energy sector . section  [ section:2 ] summarizes the constraints obtained on the previous two parameters using the present - day data , while section  [ section:3 ] shows the improvements that are expected with the euclid survey .",
    "in this section , we use observations from type ia supernovae ( snia ) , the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to constrain cosmological models in the presence of variations in both the standard dark energy and the standard dark matter sectors .      in the following",
    ", we do not work with the full likelihood of the previously mentioned probes , but with compressed forms of them .",
    "they have been shown to be faster and easier to evaluate and still remain accurate for the most common cases .",
    "we assume a flat universe , a robertson - walker metric and friedmann - lematre dynamics through all the work .",
    "the friedmann - lematre equation is then given by : @xmath5 where we have already imposed the constraint of a flat universe , i.e. the sum of the density parameters ( @xmath6 ) is equal to one . in this work",
    "we adopt the value given in @xcite for the radiation density parameter : @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sum of the mass of 3 neutrino families , which we have approximated to be zero .",
    "we also assume that the different fluids present in the universe are non - interacting with constant equation of state .",
    "the friedmann - lematre equation then reads : @xmath11    in order to determine the constraints on the parameters under study we assume a gaussian likelihood and therefore use a @xmath12 minimization procedure ; i.e. we minimize the function : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the data vector , @xmath15 is the compressed likelihood parameters representation of the data in the models under investigation and @xmath16 is the covariance matrix of the data .    as we are combining essentially independent probes , we obtain the total @xmath12 function as the sum of each of them .      for the snia data we use the compressed form of the likelihood of the jla sample  @xcite , which includes 740 snia from the full three years sdss survey  @xcite and from the compilation assembled in @xcite , comprising snia from snls , hst and several nearby experiments .",
    "the @xmath12 for the snia probe then reads : @xmath17 with : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the vector of distance modulus at redshift @xmath20 ( binned redshifts ) , @xmath21 is a free normalization parameter , @xmath22 is the covariance matrix of @xmath19 and @xmath23 is the luminosity distance ( see @xcite for detailed explanations ) .",
    "it is important to note that the normalization parameter @xmath21 must be left free in the fit and marginalized over when deriving uncertainties , in order to avoid introducing artificial constraints on the hubble constant @xmath24 .",
    "present - day bao analyses are usually performed through a spherical average of their scale measurements , resulting in a constraint on a combination of the angular scale and redshift separation .",
    "it is commonly expressed as a measure on : @xmath25 with : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angular - diameter distance , @xmath28 is the hubble parameter and @xmath29 is the redshift at which the baryons are released from the compton drag of the photons .",
    "the comoving scale @xmath30 corresponds to the total distance a sound wave can travel prior to @xmath29 and it can be expressed in terms of an integral over the sound velocity : @xmath31 where : @xmath32 with @xmath33 being the baryon density and @xmath34 the photon density . for this work ,",
    "we use the bao measurements at @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath36  @xcite and @xmath37  @xcite , following planck collaboration xvi  @xcite , which consists in the data vector @xmath38 and the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath39 .",
    "we use the fitting formulae from @xcite to compute @xmath29 and the value they provide for @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .      as shown in @xcite , a significant part of the the information coming from the cmb can be compacted into few numbers , the so - called reduced parameters : the scaled distance to recombination @xmath43 , the angular scale of the sound horizon at recombination @xmath44 and the reduced density parameter of baryons @xmath45 . for a flat universe their expressions",
    "are given by : @xmath46 where we use the fitting formulae from @xcite to compute @xmath47  the redshift of the last scattering epoch .",
    "we use the data obtained from the planck  2015 data release  @xcite , where the compressed likelihood parameters are obtained from the planck temperature - temperature plus the low-@xmath48 planck temperature - polarization likelihoods .",
    "we use the compressed likelihood parameters obtained when marginalizing over the amplitude of the lensing power spectrum for the lower values , which leads to a more conservative approach : @xmath49 with the normalized covariance matrix : @xmath50      in this section we present different cosmological models generalizing the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "constraints on cosmological parameters for these models , obtained with the existing data presented in section [ data ] , will be provided in the following section .",
    "we first study a reference model with standard cold dark matter and a dark energy component with constant equation of state parameter : @xmath52 and @xmath53 in equation ( [ ecdm ] ) .",
    "we denote this model @xmath51cdm ( see for example @xcite for a previous study of this model ) .",
    "we define the @xmath54cdm model by assigning @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this is the simplest version of the generalized dark matter ( gdm ) model  @xcite , where the cold dark matter is replaced by a gdm but keeping the speed of sound and viscosity equal to zero ( see @xcite for a detailed study of this model and other gdm models ) . since in this @xmath54cdm model",
    "we are modifying the matter component in the universe and it has an extremely important role in the cmb - era we must adapt the computation of @xmath47 and @xmath29 by changing @xmath57 by @xmath58 and compute @xmath43 as @xmath59 .",
    "this comes from the fact that we change @xmath60 by @xmath61 ; therefore , the effective @xmath62 that should appear in the cmb - era is given by :    @xmath63      finally , we consider an extended version of the @xmath54cdm model allowing for variations in the dark matter and the dark energy sectors at the same time , with a constant dark energy equation of state parameter different from @xmath65 .",
    "we denote such a model @xmath64cdm model , having two parameters for the dark sector , @xmath66 and @xmath53 .",
    "notice that for this model we must keep the previous modifications on @xmath47 , @xmath29 and @xmath43 since we modify the matter component .      in order to perform the @xmath12 minimization described in section [ data",
    "] , we use the migrad application from the minuit tool , conceived to find the minimum value of a multi - parameter function and analyze the shape of the function around the minimum @xcite . to compute the contours and the errors on the parameters we use a statistical method based on profile - likelihoods . for a given parameter @xmath67",
    "we fix it at different values and , for each of them , we minimize the @xmath12 function with respect to all the remaining parameters . for each fixed value of @xmath67",
    "we keep the @xmath68 value .",
    "the curve interpolated through @xmath69 points and offset to 0 is the so - called @xmath67 profile - likelihood @xmath70 ( see @xcite for a more detailed description and a comparison with the common mcmc method ) .        in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we show the result of our analysis for the @xmath51cdm model , with the 1-@xmath71 and 2-@xmath71 contours obtained for the @xmath72 and @xmath51 cosmological parameters . in the left panel",
    "only the information coming from the snia and the bao probes has been used ( fixing the reduced baryon density parameter to @xmath73  @xcite ) , while in the right panel the red contours correspond to the cmb probe and the black ones correspond to the combination of the three probes : snia+bao+cmb . in these cases",
    "we have not fixed the baryon density as this quantity is well constrained by the cmb probe .",
    "we have marginalized over @xmath24 in both panels .",
    "the constraints we have obtained for the different models are summarized in table[table1 ] . for the @xmath51cdm model ,",
    "our constraints are ( logically ) very similar to those of @xcite , who used the bao , the snia and the cmb through temperature fluctuations from planck  2013 and polarization fluctuations from wmap .        in fig.[fig2 ] the 1-@xmath71 and 2-@xmath71 contours for the @xmath72 and @xmath54 parameters of the @xmath54cdm model",
    "are represented . as in fig.[fig1 ] , the left panel corresponds to the result using only snia+bao ( fixing @xmath73 ) , while the right panel shows the cmb contours and the combination of the three probes , with marginalization over the baryon density .",
    "we have marginalized over @xmath24 in all cases .",
    "the specific constraints we have obtained are : @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which clearly differ from the result in @xcite , where they provide @xmath76 at 3@xmath71 confidence level .",
    "this difference can be due to the use of different cosmological probes . however , our results are compatible with @xcite where they provide @xmath77 at 2-@xmath71 confidence level , using planck data plus lensing information and the bao probe .        in fig.[fig3 ] the 1-@xmath71 and 2-@xmath71 contours for the @xmath51 and @xmath54 cosmological parameters of the @xmath64cdm model are provided .",
    "in this case only the combination of the three probes is represented , since the contours coming only from snia+bao or only from cmb are highly degenerated .",
    "we have marginalized over @xmath24 and @xmath45 .",
    "the specific obtained constraints are : @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which are slightly worse than for the @xmath51cdm and @xmath54cdm models due to the introduction of a new degree of freedom .",
    "all the constraints we have obtained are compatible with the standard @xmath0cdm model .",
    "however , it is important to stress two points here : first of all , we have seen the strong role of the cmb probe ( snia+bao alone can not provide us with good constraints for the cosmological parameters ) and , secondly , we have seen that the constraints on dark matter and dark energy are not completely independent ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "this implies that all the assumptions done in one of the sectors may influence the constraints obtained in the other one .",
    "in this section we derive the expected precision achievable on the previous models , using the galaxy power spectrum euclid survey in the linear regime .      in the following",
    ", the forecast is based on a fisher matrix formalism in a parameterized cosmological model considering the hubble parameter and the angular - diameter distance as observables .",
    "we rely on the following matter power spectrum  @xcite : @xmath80 ^ 2\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0}\\right)^{n_s}\\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the growth function  @xcite , @xmath82 is the transfer function  @xcite , @xmath83 mpc@xmath84 , @xmath85  @xcite and @xmath86  @xcite is the spectral index .",
    "the observed galaxy power spectrum is different from the matter power spectrum because of the biasing of galaxies and their velocity field .",
    "it can be related to @xmath87 by  @xcite : @xmath88 with : @xmath89p_{\\text{matter}}(k , z)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the bias factor between the galaxy and matter distributions , @xmath91  @xcite and @xmath92 stand for the parallel and transverse components of @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94 is an unknown residual noise which we neglect , since it is expected to introduce negligible error  @xcite .",
    "the ref subscript stands for the reference cosmology .    for a given redshift interval ,",
    "the fisher matrix is given by  @xcite : @xmath95 where we have changed @xmath92 by @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( the modulus of * k * and the cosine of the angle between * k * and the line - of - sight , respectively ) . according to @xcite the maximum scale of the survey @xmath98 has almost no effect on the results ; therefore we adopt @xmath99 .",
    "the minimum scale @xmath100 is used to exclude scales affected by the non - linear regime , where our linear power spectra would be inaccurate .",
    "we interpolate the values given in @xcite for @xmath101 .",
    "the effective volume of the survey is given by : @xmath102 ^ 2\\,\\text{d}\\textbf{r}\\\\ & = \\left[\\frac{np(k,\\mu)}{np(k,\\mu)+1}\\right]^2v_{\\text{survey}}\\,.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equality holds for a uniform density of galaxies .",
    "the comoving volume of the survey @xmath103 is given by  @xcite : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the solid angle .",
    "according to  @xcite we multiply the integrand of the fisher matrix by an exponential suppression @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , in order to take into account the redshift error @xmath108 of the galaxy survey .",
    "once we have obtained the fisher matrix for the observables @xmath28 and @xmath109 we can propagate it to the fisher matrix for the parameters using  @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 stand for the observables @xmath28 or @xmath109 , and @xmath112 for the parameters under study .",
    "the fisher matrix for all the redshift range of the survey is given by the sum of the fisher matrices for each redshift bin .",
    "the inverse of the resulting fisher matrix gives us the uncertainties and correlations of all the parameters studied in the forecast .      in this work",
    "we focus our forecast to the typical results expected for the euclid space mission : an esa medium class astronomy and astrophysics space mission which aims at understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the galaxy clustering probe of the euclid mission . in order to adapt our forecast",
    "we only need 5 parameters , whose values are taken from the euclid redbook  @xcite : the minimum and maximum redshift : @xmath113 , @xmath114 ; the area : 15000 square degrees ; the number of galaxies : @xmath115 and the precision of the redshift estimation : @xmath116 .",
    "we adopt the bias given in @xcite : @xmath117 .",
    "we split the redshift range of the survey into bins of width 0.1 in redshift .",
    "narrower bins only marginally increase the precision while requiring more computational time . finally , the reference cosmology is the one obtained in section[section : results ] and it is summarized in the fifth column of table[table1 ] .    in this work we limit ourselves to the spectroscopic survey on linear scales .",
    "we have checked that the photometric survey only marginally improves the constraints on the parameters , while including weakly non - linear scales noticeably improves these constraints .",
    "combination with the weak lensing probe would obviously lead to even better constraints  @xcite .",

    "the red contours correspond to the cmb probe and the black contours stand for the combination of the cmb and the forecast assuming a gaussian likelihood for the forecast .",
    "more precisely , when minimizing the @xmath12 function as presented in ( [ chisq ] ) , we minimize the sum of the @xmath12 corresponding to the cmb plus a @xmath12 function associated to the forecast where the covariance matrix is directly the one provided by the forecast .",

    "combination with the cmb gives : @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which are between a factor 2 and 6 better than snia+bao+cmb present - day data constraints ( fig.[fig1 ] : right panel ) .",

    "the specific constraints given by the forecast are : @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which again have greatly improved compared to the degeneracy found with snia+bao present - day data ( fig.[fig2 ] : left panel ) . adding the cmb we obtain the constraints : @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which are between a factor 2 and 5 better than present - day snia+bao+cmb constraints ( fig.[fig2 ] : right panel ) .",
    "let us recall that all the results shown here are only for the galaxy clustering probe restricted to the linear scales , so we can expect significantly better constraints from the full exploitation of the future euclid survey data .",

    "this is a remarkable result illustrating that euclid can break this degeneracy in the dark sector at low - redshift .",
    "it is worth to notice , apart from the better constraints expected from the euclid survey , that we still find contours . ]",
    "a significant correlation between the @xmath54 and @xmath51 cosmological parameters from the euclid survey ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] : left panel , green contour ) illustrating the fact that the dark matter and the dark energy sectors are not completely uncoupled and can not be constrained independently from each other .",
    "however , the sign of this correlation may be somewhat surprising : if the total density were to be constant we would expect @xmath51 and @xmath54 to be anti - correlated .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case , when all the other parameters are kept fixed ( see the small box in fig.[fig6 ] , left panel ) . when marginalizing over @xmath24 and @xmath72 the correlation changes and leads to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter : @xmath129 ( @xmath130 being the fiducial value that corresponds to our best estimate in view of present - day constraints ) and on the equation of state of dark matter @xmath131 .",
    "adding the cmb constraint to the forecast results in much stringent limits on the parameters describing the dark sector : @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( errors at 1-@xmath71 on 1 parameter ) , which are similar to the obtained constraints on the @xmath51cdm and the @xmath54cdm model parameters ( fig.[fig4 ] and fig.[fig5 ] , respectively ) .",
    "this fact highlights again the strong role of the cmb in breaking degeneracies thanks to the strong constraint on the dark matter equation of state parameter .",
    "we have investigated consequences on cosmological constraints relaxing the pressureless nature of dark matter ( @xmath3 ) .",

    "even if not fully theoretically motivated , these simple models allow us to ascertain the maximum values that the equation of state parameters are allowed to take  @xcite .",
    "we have found that cosmological constraints from present - day snia and bao data are strongly degraded , revealing a complete degeneracy between the equations of state of matter and dark energy .",
