    "in the previous literature , the false vacuum decay with gravity was investigated , in essence , by a naive extrapolation of well - established methods used for the minkowski background@xcite .",
    "there are two methods to calculate the decay rate of false vacuum , one using the euclidean path integral and the other constructing a wkb wave function .",
    "however , in both approaches such extrapolation is valid only for a tunneling potential @xmath0 satisfying the thin - wall condition ( we shall come back to this point below ) .    the false vacuum decay in quantum field theory on the minkowski background is analyzed in the semiclassical way ( i.e. , in the wkb approximation ) as follows@xcite .",
    "first , the euclidean classical equation of motion for the field @xmath1 ( we consider a real scalar field throughout the paper ) is solved by assuming the @xmath2 symmetry on the field configuration with the boundary condition that the solution is regular at the origin and asymptotically approaches the false vacuum at infinite radius",
    ". there will be two such solutions ; one trivially sitting at the false vacuum and the other that leaves the origin from a field value near the true vacuum and goes over the potential barrier .",
    "we call the former the false vacuum instanton and the latter the bounce instanton",
    ". we can take either the path - integral approach or the wave - function approach .",
    "in the path - integral approach , we sum up the contribution of instantons and fluctuations around them to obtain the tunneling amplitude or the decay rate of false vacuum . if we denote the euclidean action of the false vacuum instanton by @xmath3 and that of the bounce instanton by @xmath4 , the decay rate is given by @xmath5 . in passing ,",
    "we note that in the minkowski background it is customary to set @xmath6 so that @xmath7 .",
    "but one can take a different choice , @xmath8 , in which case both @xmath3 and @xmath4 would diverge but the difference is well - defined and independent of the value of @xmath9 .    in the wave - function approach",
    ", we construct a one - parameter family of 3-dimensional field configurations from the everywhere - false - vacuum configuration to the configuration with the true vacuum bubble about to expand in the false vacuum sea ( the critical bubble configuration ) .",
    "then , exponentiating the action of these configurations we obtain the wkb wave function(al ) describing the tunneling of the field from the false vacuum state to the state of the critical bubble @xcite . then the tunneling amplitude is obtained by taking the square of the ratio of the final state wave function to the initial state wave function , which is also given by @xmath10 .    since these two different approaches give the same result , and since there is one - to - one correspondence between a classical solution and a wkb wave function , we may justify the interpretation of the bounce instanton as describing the tunneling process and its analytic continuation to the lorentzian space - time as describing the classical configuration of the field after false vacuum decay .",
    "a trouble arises when one attempts to extrapolate the above procedure to the case of false vacuum decay with gravity .",
    "first , the scalar field equation is now coupled with the friedmann equation that governs the scale factor of the @xmath2 symmetric metric .",
    "second , and most problematically , the 4-dimensional euclidean space becomes inevitably compact with topology of @xmath11 when gravity is taken into account ( we assume @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the field value at the false vacuum and a potential of the shape depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt ] ) , i.e. , not @xmath14 as in the case of flat space - time .",
    "of course a bounce solution still exists in the presence of gravity , first obtained by coleman and deluccia@xcite",
    ". however , there will be no bounce solution that admits a 3-dimensional slice on which the field is _ asymptotically _ at false vacuum everywhere ; an instanton leaving , say , the north pole of @xmath11 from the true vacuum side does not reach the false vacuum when arriving even at the south pole .",
    "furthermore , the standard dilute gas approximation to obtain the decay rate in the path - integral approach , in which the 4-volume occupied by a vacuum bubble is assumed to be negligible compared with the whole euclidean 4-volume , fails .",
    "nevertheless , there is one special case in which the extrapolation can be almost justified .",
    "it is the thin - wall limit@xcite . in this case ,",
    "the field @xmath1 , which is sitting on the true vacuum side of the barrier at the north pole , varies abruptly at the position of the bubble wall sharply located in the northern hemisphere and @xmath15 everywhere outside the bubble .",
    "then , the solution admits a maximal 3-surface on which the extrinsic curvature of the 3-surface vanishes and @xmath15 everywhere . through this surface , we can analytically continue to the lorentzian solution that describes the false vacuum state . the critical bubble configuration that describes the moment of bubble nucleation is also a maximal 3-surface , and analytic continuation through the surface gives the space - time with an expanding bubble .",
    "thus we obtain a one - parameter family of 3-dimensional configurations that interpolates between the false vacuum and critical bubble configurations .    however , only a very restricted class of potentials admits bounce instantons in the thin - wall limit .",
    "namely , the ratio of the mass scale @xmath16 of the curvature at the top of the potential barrier , @xmath17 , to the typical mass scale @xmath18 of the potential energy density must be very large ( rigorously speaking , it must be infinitely large in the exact thin - wall limit ) .",
    "in other words , the barrier must be extremely sharply peaked .",
    "we note that this is somewhat different from the definition of the thin - wall limit originally discussed by coleman and deluccia@xcite . in our definition",
    ", since the euclidean 4-volume is proportional to @xmath19 while the 4-volume of a bubble is @xmath20 , the thin - wall limit implies small bubble radius , provided @xmath18 is smaller than the planck scale , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "field potentials with such a feature are apparently not general .",
    "however , previous discussions on the false vacuum decay with gravity have been relied on the picture of a bounce instanton having the feature of the thin - wall limit .",
    "for example , it is widely believed that the formula @xmath22 is still valid even when the bounce solution does not have the thin - wall feature at all .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of such a bounce as describing the tunneling process and describing the classical evolution from the critical bubble state has been adopted without serious considerations .    in this paper , we propose a new method to calculate the wave function describing false vacuum decay with gravity , which is not restricted to the thin - wall limit .",
    "our method gives a picture of tunneling substantially different from that in the minkowski background , but nevertheless our wave function interpolates between the false vacuum state , which is described by the trivial instanton sitting at false vacuum , and the state at the bubble nucleation , which is a maximal 3-slice containing the critical bubble of the bounce solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we first review the mini - superspace wheeler - dewitt equation for @xmath2 symmetric configurations and the wkb approximation . then we describe our method .",
    "we construct a one - parameter family of spatial configurations that interpolates between the false vacuum state and the critical bubble state .",
    "as we are interested in the wkb approximation , we consider a classical path connecting these two states .",
    "as pointed out in the above , no ` single ' classical solution admits such a path .",
    "however , a unique feature of false vacuum decay with gravity is that one can match the ` two ' instantons ( the false vacuum instanton and the bounce instanton ) smoothly across the ` south pole ' of each instanton . in section iii , by solving the wheeler - dewitt equation we explicitly perform this matching and construct the wave function that contains both the false vacuum and critical bubble states , hence describes the false vacuum decay with gravity for a wide class of tunneling potentials .",
    "it is then straightforward to calculate the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the result recovers the minkowski result if we take the zero - gravity limit @xmath23 , and also agrees with the decay rate obtained in the path - integral method with a naive extrapolation of the formula , @xmath5 .",
    "our result supports the standard interpretation that the bounce solution , despite the fact it does not contain the false vacuum configuration at all , does describe the classical evolution after false vacuum decay by analytic continuation through the critical bubble configuration .",
    "section iv is devoted to discussions . a covariant formulation of the wkb wave function for tunneling is recapitulated in appendix a.    in the rest of the paper , we keep @xmath24 and @xmath25 explicit to clarify the wkb order as well as the effect of gravity .",
    "in this section , we describe our method to construct a relevant classical path in the euclidean regime that determines the wkb tunneling wave function .",
    "we consider the action , @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , and the potential @xmath0 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] .",
    "we confine our attention to wkb wave functions that are described by classical solutions having @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "hence we consider the metric in the form , @xmath28 in which @xmath29 is the metric on a unit 3-sphere , and @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the action in the first - order form becomes @xmath31 then the wheeler - dewitt equation is written down as @xmath32 \\psi = 0 , \\label{eq : wd}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is an arbitrary constant that determines the operator - ordering ; @xmath35 corresponds to making the ordering covariant with respect to the superspace metric ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that it is not always necessary to take the @xmath36const .",
    "3-geometry as the argument of the wave function .",
    "in fact , the critical bubble configuration that describes the moment of bubble nucleation does not respect the @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "nevertheless , we shall see below that the tunneling amplitude can be calculated solely with the knowledge of the wave function for @xmath2 symmetric 3-geometries .",
    "the construction of a wkb wave function describing multi - dimensional quantum tunneling was discussed much in the literature @xcite and reformulated in a covariant manner in @xcite . given a one - parameter family of configurations that satisfies the euclidean equations of motion , the wkb wave function along the family can be obtained with this method , as recapitulated in appendix a. following this method , we first express the wave function in the form , @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then at the lowest wkb order , we have @xmath38 which is , of course , free from the operator - ordering ambiguity .    introducing a parameter @xmath39 such that @xmath40 we find @xmath41 the euclidean equations of motion for @xmath2 symmetric configurations , @xmath42 , with the choice of the lapse @xmath43 are obtained from eqs .",

    "the solutions relevant to our discussion are the trivial solution sitting at the false vacuum and the bounce instanton .",
    "the trivial instanton is explicitly given by @xmath52 , \\label{eq : fvinst}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "it represents a euclidean 4-sphere of radius @xmath54 and we call it the false vacuum ( fv ) instanton hereafter .",
    "the bounce instanton is known as the coleman - deluccia ( cd ) instanton @xcite .",
    "we denote it by @xmath55 with @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "it also has the topology of @xmath11 but the field @xmath1 varies monotonically over the potential barrier as the scale factor @xmath57 varies from zero to a maximum , then to zero .",
    "for later convenience , we set @xmath58 where @xmath59 is on the true vacuum side of the barrier , and @xmath60 where @xmath61 is on the false vacuum side of the barrier .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] . the fv and cd instantons embedded in @xmath62",
    "are schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvcd ] with 2-dimensions suppressed .      as we noted in introduction ,",
    "the cd instanton itself does not admit a maximal 3-surface on which @xmath15 everywhere , unless the potential satisfies the thin - wall condition .",
    "hence the cd instanton alone can not describe the tunneling wave function .",
    "it is then natural to suppose that the fv instanton plays a role as well .",
    "in fact , there is already a hint in the formula for the decay rate , @xmath63 , valid in the thin - wall limit , where the action of the fv instanton comes into play .",
    "we therefore consider a possibility to construct a one - parameter family of spatial configurations that connect the false vacuum state and the critical bubble state by matching these two instantons somehow . to look for this possibility",
    ", we have to keep in mind that the wkb approximation requires us that such a path should satisfy the classical equations of motion _ almost everywhere_. but this is the crucial point ; it is so not everywhere but almost everywhere . in any calculation of a wave function under the wkb approximation",
    ", there can be configurations of measure zero that violate the wkb condition , such as turning points of a classical solution , but their existence does not invalidate the calculation if one appropriately performs the matching , e.g. , by the method of asymptotic matching .",
    "then we realize that the two instantons may be actually matched through the point @xmath46 where the 3-geometry ceases to exist , hence can be regarded as a turning point of the classical solutions .    with the above considerations in mind , we combine and",
    "re - organize the @xmath2 symmetric families of configurations of the two instantons discussed in the previous subsection to a one - parameter family of configurations which adequately describes the false vacuum decay .",
    "we denote this one - parameter family by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a non - dimensional parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath65 is assumed to run through a range @xmath66 $ ] with the initial ( @xmath67 ) and final ( @xmath68 ) configurations given by the the maximal 3-slice of the fv instanton and the critical bubble configuration of the cd instanton , respectively .",
    "the initial configuration , denoted by @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvcd ] , is given by @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fvinst ] ) .",
    "we thus set @xmath71 until the scale factor @xmath57 vanishes , @xmath72    we match @xmath46 of the above to the point @xmath73 of the cd instanton , where @xmath61 is the field value at the ` south pole ' , see figs .  [",
    "fig : pt ] and [ fig : fvcd ] . note that the values of @xmath1 are different at these two points where the wkb breaks down .",
    "however , as we shall see in the next section , this will not be an obstacle since the wave function will be independent of @xmath1 in the vicinity of @xmath46 .    for @xmath74 , we take the @xmath2 symmetric configurations of the cd instanton up to the slice @xmath75 shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fvcd ] , where @xmath75 is the @xmath2 symmetric slice at @xmath76 where the 3-volume is maximum , which we denote by @xmath77 .",
    "thus @xmath78,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79    for @xmath80 , we slice the cd instanton in such a way that all of the configurations contain the common 2-sphere the slice @xmath75 and the final slice @xmath81 of the critical bubble configuration intersect .",
    "these slices do not respect the @xmath2 symmetry but are analogous to the static slices of the de sitter space of radius @xmath82 : @xmath83 as mentioned above , we label the final configuration by @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath84    as it is clear from the above construction , the lapse function @xmath85 vanishes at @xmath75 , and the geometry is degenerate there .",
    "however , this will not be a problem since we have started from the wheeler - dewitt equation ( [ eq : wd ] ) , in which the dynamical variables are @xmath86 of a 3-geometry .",
    "hence , although the lapse function plays a role when a euclidean classical solution is considered , the vanishing of it is irrelevant to our discussion ( in this connection , see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , as the relative magnitude of the wkb wave function at two different configuration is simply determined by the action integral between them , and it is independent of deformation of a path between them ( as long as the path lies on the space of the classical solution that dominates the wave function ) , the contribution from the upper - left quadrant of the cd instanton in fig .",
    "[ fig : fvcd ] swept both by the configurations between @xmath87 $ ] and @xmath88 $ ] cancel each other and only the action of the lower hemisphere determines the relative magnitude of the wave function at @xmath89 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus , although the values of the wave function for configurations in the range @xmath90 are difficult to obtain , they are not needed in the calculation of the tunneling amplitude .",
    "let us now construct the tunneling wave function . since we are interested in the false vacuum decay , we want the wave function to describe the _ expanding _ universe after tunneling .",
    "thus the appropriate boundary condition for the wave function is the tunneling boundary condition , which demands the wave function describing the classical universe after tunneling to have a positive eigenvalue for the momentum operator @xmath91 @xcite .    in accordance with the construction of the classical path given in the previous section",

    "we found the resulting tunneling amplitude agrees with the naive extrapolation of the formula whose validity had been justified only in the thin - wall limit or in the flat background .",
    "our result is a strong support for the standard interpretation that analytic continuation through the critical bubble configuration of the cd instanton describes the universe after false vacuum decay .    in our picture , the false vacuum decay with gravity becomes more or less quantum cosmological .",
    "for example , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : wv2 ] , interpreting the wave function as describing the actual tunneling path , the tunneling under consideration is quite similar to a case of standard quantum tunneling with a resonant state inside the barrier , except for the sign of the euclidean actions @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 which are negative .",
    "the difference is that the resonant state here is not a state of something but the state of ` nothing ' .",
    "this gives us a very interesting picture that the false vacuum decay is first proceeded by pumping up the amplitude in the state of nothing and subsequently a universe with an expanding bubble is created from nothing .",
    "a similar idea of joining the two instantons was previously proposed by bousso and chamblin in the context of path - integral approach@xcite .",
    "but the principles behind his approach and ours seem rather different .",
    "our method is completely within the scope of the standard wkb approximation , while they had to introduce a planck size wormhole and reverse the sign the 4-volume after traversing the wormhole in an ad hoc way .",
    "nevertheless , it is of interest to see if these two methods correspond to each other at certain level of approximations .",
    "recently , rubakov and sibiryakov proposed another method to deal with the false vacuum decay with gravity@xcite , by considering complex paths and adding a constraint to the action to realize the initial false vacuum state .",
    "it is , however , not clear how the complex path they considered joins the false vacuum and the critical bubble configuration , particularly because of the constraint that modifies the equations of motion .    we have demanded the wave function to have only the component describing an expanding universe after false vacuum decay . in this respect ,",
    "our boundary condition is very similar to the tunneling boundary condition proposed by vilenkin @xcite in the context of quantum cosmology .",
    "however , in vilenkin s picture , only the wave function for an expanding universe appears in the lorentzian region of the superspace .",
    "this means there is a steady flux coming out from the euclidean boundaries of the superspace . on the other hand ,",
    "our wave function is outgoing only for the universe after false vacuum decay . indeed , along the line @xmath15 in the superspace , where the universe is in the false vacuum , our wave function has both expanding and contracting components .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : ss ] .",
    "the latter feature is similar to the one of the hartle - hawking wave function @xcite .",
    "these similarities of our wave function with both the vilenkin and hartle - hawking wave functions can be seen also in fig .",
    "[ fig : wv2 ] : if we consider only the right - hand side ( @xmath74 ) of the figure , it looks exactly like the cosmological wave function satisfying the vilenkin boundary condition .",
    "in fact , the amplitude at @xmath46 ( @xmath89 ) is dominated by the component that decreases exponentially as @xmath57 increases , as is the case of the vilenkin wave function . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider only the left - hand side ( @xmath153 ) of the figure , our wave function can be approximately regarded as a hartle - hawking wave function .",
    "the exponentially decreasing component becomes totally negligible when it appears in the lorentzian region , hence it is an irrelevant component , while the exponentially increasing component dominates the wave function in the lorentzian region , which consists of both outgoing and ingoing components with equal weight .",
    "this is the characteristic hartle - hawking feature .",
    "we have considered only the leading order behavior of the wkb wave function . we need to analyze the next order to determine the quantum state of fluctuations after tunneling .",
    "it seems , however , that there is no reason to expect the result should differ from the ones obtained previously under the assumption of the euclidean vacuum associated with the cd instanton .",
    "this is because all the properties of the quantum fluctuations are determined by the euclidean structure of a single classical solution , which is the cd instanton , as far as we are interested only in the state after false vacuum decay : the quantum fluctuations around the cd instanton is completely decoupled from those around the fv instanton .",
    "then once we focus only on the cd instanton , our wave function satisfies the outgoing boundary condition , and it is known to give the euclidean vacuum state@xcite .",
    "this reassures the validity of previous calculations of quantum fluctuations in the one - bubble open inflation scenario@xcite .",

    "<S> we consider a wave - function approach to the false vacuum decay with gravity and present a new method to calculate the tunneling amplitude under the wkb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the result agrees with the one obtained by the euclidean path - integral method , but gives a much clearer interpretation of an instanton ( euclidean bounce solution ) that dominates the path integral . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our method is fully capable of dealing with the case of a thick wall with the radius of the bubble comparable to the radius of the instanton , thus surpassing the path - integral method whose use can be justified only in the thin - wall and small bubble radius limit . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is done by matching two wkb wave functions , one with the final state and another with the initial state , with the wave function in the region where the scale factor of the metric is sufficiently small compared with the inverse of the typical energy scale of the field potential at the tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> the relation of the boundary condition on our wave function for the false vacuum decay with hartle - hawking s no - boundary boundary condition and vilenkin s tunneling boundary condition on the wave function of the universe is also discussed .    * false vacuum decay with gravity in non - thin - wall limit *     uchida gen and misao sasaki + _ department of earth and space science , graduate school of science , + osaka university , toyonaka 560 - 0043 , japan + 2.5 mm and + 2.5 mm department of physics , the university of tokyo , tokyo 113 - 0033 , japan _ </S>"
