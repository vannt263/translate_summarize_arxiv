    "recent years have witnessed an upsurge in the study of complex systems that can be described in terms of networks , in which the vertices picture the elementary units composing the system , and the edges represent the interactions or relations between pairs of units @xcite .",
    "these studies have led to the development of a modern theory of complex networks which has found fruitful applications in fields as diverse as the internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , or biological interacting networks @xcite .",
    "an important example of this kind of systems , that has attracted a great deal of interest from researchers in different scientific fields , are social networks @xcite .",
    "the study of social networks has been traditionally hindered by the small size of the networks considered and the difficulties in the process of data collection ( usually from questionnaires or interviews ) .",
    "more recently , however , the increasing availability of large digital databases has allowed to study a particular class of social networks , the so - called _ collaboration networks_. these networks can be defined in a non - ambiguous way , and their exceptionally large size has permitted empirical researchers to obtain a reliable statistical description of their topological properties and to arrive at solid conclusions concerning their structure .",
    "social collaboration networks are generally defined in terms of a set of people ( called _ actors _ in the social science literature ) , and a set of _ collaboration acts_. actors relate to each other by the fact of having participated in a common collaboration act .",
    "examples of this kind of networks can be found in movie actors related by co - starring the same movie , scientist related by co - authoring a scientific paper , members of the boards of company directors related by sitting on the same board , etc .",
    "collaboration networks can be represented as bipartite graphs @xcite with two types of vertices , one kind representing the actors , while vertices of the other kind are acts of collaboration . as a rule , however , it is the one - mode projections of these bipartite graphs that are empirically studied . in these projections ,",
    "the vertices representing the acts of collaboration are excluded , and collaborating pairs of actors are connected by edges . since multiple connections in the projected graph are usually ignored , the projection is less informative than the original bipartite graph .",
    "the study of several examples of large collaboration networks @xcite allows one to draw a number of conclusions regarding the main topological properties of one - mode projections of these networks :    1 .",
    "the degree distribution @xmath0 , defined as the probability that a vertex is connected to @xmath1 other vertices , often exhibits a fat tail , that can be approximated by a power law behavior for large @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   the clustering coefficient , roughly defined as the probability that two neighbors of any given vertex are also neighbors of each other , takes in average large values , and",
    "it locally depends on the vertex degree , signaling the presence of a structure in the network @xcite .",
    "the degrees of the nearest neighbor vertices are positively correlated , i.e. , vertices with large degree have a high probability to be connected to vertices with large degree , and vice - versa .",
    "this property has been dubbed _ assortative mixing _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the general presence of these three properties in most collaboration graphs prompts toward the development of models capable to reproduce and explain these features . in general , the first insight into the architecture of a complex network is provided by `` formal '' constructions of random graphs .",
    "these constructions allow one to reproduce the structure of complex networks , but completely ignore the mechanisms underlying these architectures .",
    "the minimal formal model of a complex one - partite graph , that is a graph composed by a single type of vertices , is the configuration model @xcite . in simple terms ,",
    "the configuration model generates ( uncorrelated ) graphs , which are maximally random under the constraint that their degree distribution is a given one .",
    "similarly , the minimal model of a complex bipartite graph is a bipartite network that is maximally random under the constraint that the two degree distributions for both kinds of vertices are given @xcite .",
    "one can see that this is a direct generalization of the configuration model to bipartite graphs .",
    "the quality of the configuration model applied to bipartite graphs was checked in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", it was proved that the empirical degree distribution of the one - mode projection of a bipartite collaboration graph agrees with that of the configuration model when the empirically observed degree distributions are imposed on the two kinds of vertices .",
    "one should emphasize that a one - mode projection of an uncorrelated bipartite graph is correlated .",
    "in particular , this projection contains numerous triangles of edges which results in a high clustering @xcite .",
    "therefore , it might seem at first sight that , in order to explain the nature of the structure of collaboration networks , it is sufficient ( i ) to propose a mechanism generating the specific degree distributions of the two kinds of vertices and afterwards ( ii ) to connect vertices by using the configuration model .",
    "this approach , however , fails to reproduce the complex distribution of connections over collaboration networks , since assumes pure randomness .",
    "also , it does not explain specific distributions of vertex degrees , which , in the configuration model , are assumed to be given .",
    "note that , while providing reasonable values of clustering , the configuration model fails to reproduce the type of degree  degree correlations in collaboration networks .",
    "consequently , in order to fully explain the specific architecture of collaboration networks ( fat - tailed degree distributions , high clustering , assortative mixing , etc . )",
    ", we have to introduce a mechanism for the linking of vertices in these networks .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a first approximation to such a mechanism . in our approach , we treat collaboration networks as growing , self - organizing , correlated bipartite graphs , applying the ideas at the basis of the preferential attachment concept put forward by barabsi and albert @xcite in the network modeling context ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) to bipartite graphs .",
    "the simplest model that we can define already allows us to quantitatively describe most of the empirical data on collaboration networks without fitting , only by using basic numbers characterizing the real networks .",
    "we emphasize that the absence of fitting convincingly proves the validity of the concept .",
    "the degree ",
    "degree correlations in the one - mode projections of collaboration graphs are a topic of our special interest .",
    "we show that the `` assortative mixing '' character of these correlations are not so inevitable in collaboration networks , as it is usually believed @xcite .",
    "we explain the origin of the assortative mixing in real collaboration networks in terms of the aging of actors , which can not accept new connections during the whole growth process of the network .",

    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , collaboration networks can be represented as bipartite graphs @xcite .",
    "on one side , we have collaboration acts ( e.g. movie co - starring or paper co - authorship , belonging to the same company , school , etc . ) , that may be represented as a special kind of vertices . on the other side",
    "we have the actors ( normal vertices ) , that are linked to the collaborations acts in which they participate .",
    "two independent degree distributions may then be defined : first , the probability @xmath2 of having @xmath3 actors participating in any collaboration act ; and second , the probability @xmath4 that any actor has taken part in @xmath5 collaboration acts .    in most of cases , however , the object of study is not the whole bipartite graph but its one - mode projection : i.e. , the network formed by the collaborating actors linked to each other whenever they have shared a collaboration act . for this projected network ,",
    "another degree distribution @xmath0 may be considered , defined as the probability that any given actor is connected to @xmath1 others .",
    "focusing on the one - mode projection of a collaboration network , many other properties generally studied in common random graphs can be measured .",
    "this type of study has already been carried out for several empirical social networks ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the quantities that we use to describe the structure of the projected network are the clustering coefficient and the mean clustering @xcite , the average clustering coefficient of vertices of degree @xmath1 @xcite , the average degree of the nearest neighbors of the vertices of degree @xmath1 @xcite , and the pearson correlation coefficient defined in refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the number @xmath53 may also be either constant or a random variable . at each time step",
    ", the total number of actors increases as @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the model generates a bipartite graph of @xmath55 movie vertices and @xmath15 actor vertices .",
    "note that the proportional preference corresponds to the following practical rule of selection of actors : a director randomly selects a previous movie and then chooses at random one of its actors .",
    "one can see that the evolution rules of the present model practically coincide with those of the simon model @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the number of actors playing in each movie is constant and equal to its average value , @xmath57 , as well as the number of new actors per movie , @xmath58 .",
    "this assumption is in fact quite reasonable given the exponential nature of the @xmath2 distributions observed empirically .",
    "we also assume that if the total number of actors is large , the probability that two actors selected for a new movie have already co - starred in other old film is vanishingly small .",
    "note that , strictly speaking , this assumption is only valid for uncorrelated networks with rapidly decreasing degree distributions .",
    "nevertheless , the results obtained with it provide a good enough approximation to the empirical values ( see table  [ tab : averages ] ) to justify its introduction .    within this approximation , since each movie starred by an actor leads to the acquisition of @xmath59 new co - actors , we have a strict relation between the experience of an actor , @xmath5 , and the total number of its co - actors ( its degree in the projected network ) , @xmath1 : @xmath60 in particular , at large @xmath1 and @xmath5 , when we can consider both variables to be continuous , we have @xmath61    in the limit of large @xmath15 , the total number of edges in the one - mode projected graph ( the number of pairwise coactorships ) is @xmath55 times the number of pairs of actors in a new film , that is , @xmath62 , while the total number of actors is @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the mean degree of the one - mode projection network is @xmath64 therefore , @xmath65    as in the simon model , the connections of this growing bipartite graph self - organize into a scale - free structure . quite similarly to standard derivations for the simon model , in the large network limit , the distribution takes the form @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath68-function @xcite and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , the asymptotics of @xmath4 is @xmath71 so that @xmath72 is the exponent of the degree distribution . in the one - mode projection",

    "the presence of this off - set , which may be large for large values of @xmath75 , can hinder the direct evaluation of the exponent @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to compare the degree distribution with the general expression eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) .    to calculate the clustering coefficient",
    ", we need to recall our second assumption : if we consider a particular actor , @xmath7 , who has played in @xmath5 movies , in the thermodynamic limit none of his co - actors repeats twice in different films .",
    "this means that in the projected network the triangles attached to a vertex @xmath7 can only relate his co - actors inside each separate movie .",
    "the number of such triangles is @xmath76 , while the total number of possible triangles attached to @xmath7 is @xmath77 or , equivalently , @xmath78/2 $ ] .",
    "the local clustering as a function of the experience of an actor is then given by    @xmath79    which , as a function of @xmath1 , transforms into @xmath80    then using the definition ( 6 ) readily yields the average clustering    @xmath81    on the other hand , to compute the clustering coefficient @xmath18 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , we need to estimate the number of triangles attached to a vertex of degree @xmath1 . as we have seen before , this number is @xmath82 , or , in terms of @xmath1 , @xmath83 .",

    "\\label{e13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can see that the average clustering @xmath85 converges to a finite value for any degree distribution , since the region of low degrees makes the main contribution .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ e12 ] ) works well even if the degree distribution is fat - tailed .",
    "the clustering coefficient , on the other hand , approaches zero if the second moment of the degree distribution diverges .",
    "this divergence takes place for @xmath86 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath87 ) . in this case , @xmath18 crucially depends on the degree cutoff @xmath88 ( or @xmath89 ) in the form @xmath90 . note that formula ( [ e13 ] ) may underestimate the value of the clustering coefficient if the degree distribution is fat - tailed and @xmath88 is large .",
    "to check the validity of our model , we proceed to compare the empirical data on collaboration networks with the predictions made in the previous section , as well as with numerical simulations of the model .",
    "the analytic predictions are specified in terms of two parameters , the average number of actors per collaboration act @xmath75 and the average number of new actors @xmath91 .",
    "if all these actors are recruited at a constant rate , then we have in average @xmath92 new actors per collaboration act . from these two parameters , using the results of the previous section",
    ", we can compute our predictions for all the properties of the networks described in section  [ sec : empir - data - coll ] . when performing numerical simulations of the model , and in order to avoid discreteness , we use randomly distributed @xmath53 and @xmath3 .",
    "their distributions are taken to be exponential with averages @xmath91 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "this functional form corresponds to that of the distribution @xmath2 empirically observed for actor and scientific collaboration networks ( see fig .  [",
    "f1]a ) . for the company directorship network on the other hand , we do not count with an empirical form of @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we checked both exponential and poisson distributions .",
    "the global characteristics of the networks generated with this last distribution suit better their empirical counterparts .",
    "the results of the comparison between empirical data , theoretical predictions and simulations are summarized in table  [ tab : averages ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we observe an agreement between the model predictions and the empirical results for the mean clustering @xmath93 .",
    "note some deviations in the mean degree @xmath94 of one - mode projected networks .",
    "these discrepancies are due to the fact that in our analysis we neglect the probability that some actors for a new film have previously co - starred in the same movies . for the net of codirectorships ,",
    "the computed clustering coefficient @xmath18 is in a reasonable agreement with the empirical value . in the other networks ,",
    "however , the calculated values of @xmath18 are severely underestimated .",
    "the reason for this is the poor quality of the approximate formula ( [ e13 ] ) for this model in the case of a fat - tailed degree distribution ( see discussion in sec .",
    "[ s - model ] ) .",
    "the exponents of the projected degree distribution are @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the movie , coauthorship and codirectorship networks , respectively .",
    "the exponent larger than @xmath98 in this last case is compatible with the exponential decay observed empirically .",
    "the range of the empirical degree distribution in the coauthorship network is too small to compare with the asymptotic expression eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "so , we make this comparison only in the case of the movie actors network , fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the agreement between the theoretical and empirical distributions is notorious . only at very small and very large values of the degree a certain discrepancy can be noticed essentially due to the continuous degree approximation employed and the presence of a cutoff in the empirical distribution , respectively .",
    "this upper cutoff is inevitable due to two factors : ( i ) an actor physically can not have an infinite number of co - stars , and ( ii ) finite size effects restrict the degrees of vertices ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the empirical local clustering and its analogue obtained by numerical simulations ( fig .  [ f5 ] )",
    "demonstrate a more complex dependence on degree that the simple estimate of eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) . from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we see that the function @xmath17 computed from the model follows a slower decay than the corresponding empirical function for the movie actors network .",
    "the results for the mean degree of the nearest neighbors of a vertex as a function of its degree , @xmath24 , are represented in fig .",
    "unexpectedly , apart from a small region for very small values of @xmath1 , @xmath24 decreases with degree , and the pearson correlation coefficient is negative ( see table  [ tab : averages ] ) .",
    "so that , unlike real - world collaboration graphs , networks with a fat - tailed degree distribution , generated by the simplest version of our model , show disassortative mixing . on the contrary , in the case of directorship networks ,",
    "the model provides positive values for the pearson coefficient @xmath28 , in agreement with the empirical results , though a little lower ( see discussion in the next section ) .",
    "at least in one aspect , the model presented above is a serious oversimplification of the mechanism underlying the growth of social collaboration networks .",
    "it allows an analytical treatment but leads to problems in the comparison with the clustering coefficient and , especially , degree  degree correlations of empirical networks .",
    "the most important missing point is probably the aging of individual agents .",
    "this issue is evident in the case of the movie actors network ( although it can be observed for the scientific collaboration network too ) .",
    "the internet movie database site , from which the actor collaboration network was extracted , contains information spanning the whole century of the history of cinema , from louis lumiere to the most recent hollywood productions . considering that actors have a finite professional life time",
    ", it is unrealistic to allow them to take part in a movie irrespective of their age .",
    "if we take into account this fact , two main consequences are immediately expected . on the one side , there should be an upper cutoff in the @xmath4 distribution corresponding to the professional life expectation of actors , as actually it is found in empirical distributions , and , in addition , not all actors may work together : only those who are contemporaneous .",
    "obviously , this phenomenon affects much less the codirectorship network because of its exponential degree distribution .    to introduce this new ingredient in the model",
    ", we must first assume an aging rate for individual agents .",
    "the most straightforward way to do so is to suppose that the time is directly equivalent to the experience @xmath5 .",
    "actually , in more realistic situations , it may happen that each agent has its own aging rhythm .",
    "however , the latter version of aging would make the model more complex .",
    "once time is identified , we must consider a survival probability distribution for agents .",
    "in parallel with biological systems , we will assume an almost sure survival till a certain age @xmath99 and an exponential decay hereafter .",
    "the modification of the model then requires of two new parameters : the cutoff @xmath99 and the characteristic time of the exponential decay @xmath100 .",
    "the rest of the model remains the same .",
    "that is , in each step a new movie is produced , @xmath53 actors are new and the rest of them @xmath54 are chosen at random with a probability proportional to their experience .",
    "in addition , we assume that the actors become inactive , i.e. they can not be chosen again for new movies , with a probability given by the complementary of the survival distribution for their particular age @xmath5 .",
    "we carried out simulations with the new version of the model .",
    "@xmath99 was fixed at @xmath101 for the actors network and at @xmath102 for scientific collaborations to agree with the cutoff observed in the empirical distributions @xmath4 of these networks .",
    "the value of the other parameter , @xmath100 , is not so easy to establish from phenomenological data , therefore we check several characteristic times . for",
    "the sake of concreteness , let us focus on the results obtained with @xmath103 for actor co - starring and with @xmath104 for scientific coauthorships , which are realistic values compatible with the final decay of the @xmath4 empirical distributions . actually , using @xmath100 two times bigger we did not observe essential differences in the properties of the networks .",
    "moreover , a simple exponential survival probability ( i.e. , with the only parameter @xmath100 ) also provides similar approximate values of the clustering coefficient and the pearson coefficient .",
    "however , it does not allow to satisfactory describe the whole degree distribution .",
    "note that our choice of the aging parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 does not actually mean fitting of our final results , which are the clustering and degree  degree correlation characteristics .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 were chosen only to properly describe the degree distribution in the range of large degrees .    in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , the local clustering is plotted as a function of the degree for a network with aging and for the empirical actor network .",
    "the dependence @xmath17 adjusts better to empirical data , and the computed clustering coefficients are closer to the empirical ones ( see table  [ tab : averages ] ) .",
    "the improvement on these coefficients is understandable .",
    "as one can see from our simple analytical estimations , the direct introduction of the cutoff in the degree distribution seriously improves the values of the clustering coefficients .",
    "a far more important point is that the aging changes the type of degree  degree correlations . in the version of the model with aging",
    ", the computed dependence of the mean degree of the nearest neighbor of a vertex on its degree properly describes the empirical dependence , as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . as a result ,",
    "the computed values of the pearson correlation coefficients turns out to be positive ( assortative mixing ) and close enough to the empirical values ( see table  [ tab : averages ] ) .",
    "one should note that in the framework of the configuration model of an uncorrelated bipartite network , this agreement is impossible .",
    "we have checked this claim in the following way : we have measured the degree ",
    "degree correlations in the one - mode projection resulting from an uncorrelated bipartite graph with the same degree distributions for both types of vertices as generated by our model .",
    "in contrast to the self - organized model , see fig .",
    "[ uncorrelated ] , the curve @xmath105 turns out to be nearly flat , the pearson coefficient being close to zero .",
    "this signals that the degree  degree correlations are practically absent in this case .",
    "in summary , we have studied a minimal model of evolving , self - organizing collaboration networks .",
    "this model is not based on a static perspective as was the configuration model , but on a dynamical mechanism to construct the network . besides , its basic constituents are preferential attachment and the bipartite structure of social networks .",
    "our results show that the self - organized model offers a good starting point to explain existing empirical data .",
    "the model was compared with empirical results for a number of real networks , namely a network of scientific coauthorships , a network of movie actor collaborations and a network of company codirectorships .",
    "we have shown that , apart of a generic bipartite structure and the growth factor , one more element has to be taken into account in order to explain the empirical observations on the clustering and degree  degree correlations in collaboration networks .",
    "this key factor is the aging of collaborators .",
    "we demonstrate that in collaboration networks this effect is responsible for the positive ( assortative ) degree - degree correlations .",
    "we conclude that assortative mixing , which is generally observed in collaboration networks , is produced by the combination of their bipartite structure and the aging of the collaborators .",
    "one should note that , in principle , even uncorrelated bipartite graphs ( the configuration model ) have correlated one - mode projections .",
    "however , the specific degree  degree correlations in these projections are quite weak .",
    "in other words , the configuration model graphs with degree distributions typical for movie actor nets show neither assortative nor disassortative mixing ( they have @xmath106 ) .",
    "in contrast , our self - organized model provides correlated bipartite graphs , which , under natural assumptions , have one - mode projections with realistic structure and realistic correlations .",
