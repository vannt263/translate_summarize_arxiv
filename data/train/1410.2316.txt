    "being both ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic at room temperature , bifeo@xmath0 holds tantalizing promise for novel device applications and has become one of the most studied multiferroic materials .",
    "@xcite the direct coupling between the static ferroelectric order ( @xmath5k )  @xcite and antiferromagnetic order ( @xmath6k ) is relatively weak , resulting in a cycloidal spin structure with long wavelength modulations ( @xmath7   ) .",
    "@xcite yet there has been a growing interest in the coupling between dynamical properties in recent years .",
    "for example , a `` magneto - optical '' resonance has been proposed theoretically ,  @xcite and extra modes located below the lowest - lying optic phonon energies have been observed in raman measurements .",
    "@xcite zone - center optic phonon modes have been studied extensively using raman spectroscopy  @xcite and infrared reflectivity .",
    "@xcite a full understanding of the energy - momentum dependence of the dynamics in bifeo@xmath0 is , however , still far from complete . only with the recent achievements in the growth of large bifeo@xmath0 single crystals have researchers been able to start carrying out neutron inelastic and x - ray scattering measurements on both the lattice and spin dynamics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present neutron inelastic scattering measurements of the low - energy phonon modes in a large bifeo@xmath0 single crystal from 300k to 700k .",
    "the dispersions of the three acoustic phonon modes ( ta@xmath1 , propagating along [ 010 ] and polarized along [ 100 ] ; ta@xmath2 , propagating along @xmath3 $ ] and polarized along [ 110 ] ; and la , propagating and polarized along [ 100 ] ) , and the lowest - lying optic modes are mapped out in three different brillouin zones .",
    "the measured phonon dispersions and intensities ( after removing the bose - factor ) show no significant change with temperature outside of experimental errors .",
    "however , the transverse acoustic modes at the zone - boundary clearly broaden in energy when the sample is heated towards @xmath8 ; this suggests that a coupling exists between the low - energy lattice and antiferromagnetic dynamics in this multiferroic system .",
    "single crystals of bifeo@xmath0 were grown using the traveling - solvent floating - zone technique .",
    "@xcite the crystal used in this study has a cylindrical shape , a mass of 4 g , and a mosaic full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of less than 1@xmath9 .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering experiments were performed on the hyspec time - of - flight spectrometer  @xcite , which is located at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the incident neutron energy @xmath10 was fixed at 20mev .",
    "we will refer to the pseudo - cubic unit cell with @xmath11  when describing our results . in this coordinate system",
    "the magnetic ordering wave vector is ( 0.5,0.5,0.5 ) .",
    "the crystal @xmath12-axis was oriented vertically to allow access to reflections of the form @xmath13 in the horizontal scattering plane . during the measurements",
    "the crystal was rotated about the @xmath12-axis by 90@xmath9 in steps of 2@xmath9 in order to provide full coverage of the reciprocal lattice scattering plane ( within kinematical constraints ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:1 ] , we plot the dynamic response function @xmath14 , which is simply the measured neutron scattering intensity divided by the bose factor , at 300 , 500 , and 700k .",
    "each panel contains data obtained from two - dimensional ( 2d ) slices through energy - momentum space .",
    "the left panels show la phonons propagating along [ 100 ] between the @xmath15 points at ( 100 ) and ( 200 ) . the center panels show phonons propagating along @xmath3 $ ] between ( 110 ) and ( 200 ) . near the ( 110 ) zone center",
    "these are ta@xmath2 and to@xmath2 modes .",
    "the right panels show phonons propagating along [ 010 ] between ( 200 ) and ( 210 ) , which are ta@xmath1 and to@xmath1 phonons near ( 200 ) .",
    "we see that whereas the la , ta@xmath1 , and ta@xmath2 phonons are all well defined , the optic modes are much less clear in our measurements .",
    "in particular , the structure factor of the to@xmath2 mode near ( 110 ) is extremely weak and can barely be observed .    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] reveal no significant changes in the overall features of the dynamic response in bifeo@xmath0 between 300k and 700k . to obtain more detailed information , we fit these data using lorentzian functions of @xmath16 convoluted with the gaussian instrumental resolution function to extract the acoustic and optic phonon intensities vs. energy transfer @xmath17 at various wave vectors @xmath16 . the phonon energy , energy width ( @xmath18 ) , and intensity were also obtained from these fits .",
    "the phonon dispersions obtained from the fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "we note here that all uncertainties and error bars in this and subsequent figures represent standard deviations .",
    "the energies of all acoustic modes show little to no temperature variation , especially in the long wave - length ( small @xmath16 ) limit . near the zone boundary a slight softening on warming",
    "is observed for the ta@xmath1 mode near ( 2,0.5,0 ) and for the ta@xmath2 mode near ( 1.5,0.5,0 ) .",
    "however the size of this softening is @xmath19mev , which is comparable to our experimental uncertainty .",
    "the optic phonon intensities are considerably weaker than those of the acoustic phonons , and consequently the optic phonon energies have larger error bars . the to@xmath2 phonon intensity near the ( 110 ) zone center is particularly weak ( fig .  [ fig:1 ] , middle column ) , and for this reason we were not able to determine the to@xmath2 phonon dispersion along @xmath3 $ ] . in the other two zones ,",
    "the to@xmath1 mode propagating along [ 100 ] is almost flat , while the lo mode measured along [ 100 ] is quite steep .",
    "similar to the negligible softening observed for the zone - boundary acoustic modes , the zone - center optic modes also show a slight decrease in energy on warming .",
    "but the zone - boundary optic mode energies exhibit a slight increase instead .",
    "our results are generally consistent with the neutron inelastic scattering measurements of delaire _",
    "et al_.  on powder samples of bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite they found that the lowest - energy optic phonon branch bottoms out around 8mev and that the top of the ta branch is close to 6.5mev . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , one can see that the relevant energies are roughly 8.0mev ( lowest to phonon energy ) and 6.5mev ( top of the ta phonon branch ) .",
    "the value of 8.0mev is also close to the 57@xmath20 line observed via raman scattering  @xcite and the 66@xmath20 line seen in infrared measurements ,  @xcite both of which probe zone - center ( @xmath21 ) optic modes .",
    "other raman  @xcite and x - ray inelastic scattering studies  @xcite suggest that the lowest - energy to mode is around 9.2mev .",
    "however our results show that a zone - center optic mode is present at 8mev , clearly below 9mev , as is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] .    based on the measured acoustic phonon branches",
    ", a number of useful bulk parameters such as the elastic constants can be obtained .",
    "@xcite here we make use of the expression @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the phonon velocity for the ta@xmath1 , ta@xmath2 or la modes , @xmath24g/@xmath25 is the density of bifeo@xmath0 , and @xmath26 is the effective elastic constant , where @xmath27 for the la mode along [ 100 ] , @xmath28 for the ta@xmath1 mode along [ 100 ] , and @xmath29 for the ta@xmath2 mode along @xmath3 $ ] .",
    ".description of the acoustic phonons . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    the acoustic phonon velocities were obtained from the limiting slopes of the 300k dispersion curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and are are listed in table  i. from these we obtain @xmath30gpa , @xmath31gpa , @xmath32gpa , and the bulk modulus @xmath33gpa .",
    "we note that the room temperature values of the longitudinal elastic constant @xmath34 derived from previous experimental  @xcite and theoretical work  @xcite on bifeo@xmath0 are highly inconsistent .",
    "the value of @xmath34 ranges from @xmath35gpa ( our neutron measurements ) , to @xmath36gpa ( ultrasonic measurements ) , to @xmath37gpa ( x - ray inelastic measurements ) .",
    "we believe that the difference between our results and those from the ultrasonic measurements is an artifact of comparing @xmath34 for a single crystal sample to @xmath38 for a ceramic sample .",
    "@xmath34 is determined by the longitudinal acoustic phonon velocity along [ 100 ] .",
    "when the la phonon velocities along other crystallographic directions are higher , a powder / ceramic average will lead to a larger value of @xmath38 .",
    "with respect to the x - ray scattering measurements in ref .  , we note that a different coordinate system with trigonal symmetry was used along with a different definition of @xmath39}^2 $ ] . for the purpose of obtaining bulk properties in the pseudo - cubic coordinate system ,",
    "our results provide a direct reference for the acoustic phonon velocities and elastic constants .",
    "in addition to the acoustic modes and low - energy optic modes discussed above , we have also observed a few spurious signals in our measurements .",
    "for example , one can see a faint streak of intensity originating from the ( 200 ) bragg peak in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] that increases to about 4mev at ( 1.5,0,0 ) , thus resembling a phonon branch below the la branch .",
    "the intensity of this spurion has no temperature dependence , which is why when @xmath40 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( and the bose factor is divided out ) it appears to weaken at higher temperatures .",
    "when we checked the energy gain side of our scattering data , we found no trace of this spurion , which does not happen with real phonons .",
    "we believe it is most likely caused by spurious intensities coming from detectors located close to the strong ( 200 ) bragg peak .",
    "we also looked for , but did not detect , any extra modes that resemble the `` electromagnon '' excitations observed by raman measurements  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows energy scans for the ta@xmath2 mode ( @xmath41 $ ] ) at two different wave vectors .",
    "the intensities correspond to the dynamic response function @xmath42 ( measured scattering intensity divided by the bose factor ) . for small values of @xmath16 , like that shown in the top panel",
    ", there is virtually no change of @xmath42 between 300k and 700k .",
    "but at the zone boundary ( @xmath43 ) , as shown in the bottom panel , we observe a clear broadening of the phonon linewidth that is accompanied with a slight softening as the temperature increases towards @xmath6k .",
    "we see some evidence of an optic phonon located near 8.5mev in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , however it is so weak that we are unable to fit it in a meaningful way",
    ". fortunately it does not affect our measurement of the ta@xmath2 phonon linewidth .",
    "we also observe a broadening of the zone - boundary ta@xmath1 mode , but none is seen for the zone - boundary la mode . a plot of the phonon energy widths @xmath18 between 300k and 700k for different @xmath44 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . here",
    "we see that only in panels ( b ) and ( d ) , which are the zone boundary positions for the ta@xmath1 and ta@xmath2 modes , do the phonon energy widths increase on heating close to @xmath8 . for all other wave vectors",
    "there is very little temperature dependence to the phonon energy widths .",
    "this anomaly in the ta phonon energy width is unlikely to be the result of pure thermal broadening because it correlates well with @xmath8 and is not seen at other wave vectors .",
    "previous neutron scattering measurements of the phonon density - of - states ( dos ) in powdered bifeo@xmath0  @xcite reveal a strong anharmonicity as evidenced by phonon softening and broadening on warming .",
    "these dos measurements are mostly focused on the optic modes ; by contrast , our measurements show that the acoustic phonons in bifeo@xmath0 are well defined and display no significant energy broadening or softening from 300k to 700k for small @xmath16",
    ". signs of anharmonicity only occur for ta phonons at the zone - boundaries .",
    "the fact that the ta phonon broadening at the zone boundary becomes pronounced when the nel temperature @xmath8 is approached and the magnetic order starts to melt implies a possible connection between the ta phonons and the magnetic phase transition .",
    "previous raman measurements  @xcite have suggested that certain optic phonon modes also behave anomalously near @xmath8 , which is indicative of a spin - phonon coupling in this multiferroic material and possibly other multiferroic perovskites .",
    "@xcite our results show that the effects of spin - phonon coupling also extend to the ta phonons .",
    "it is possible that this anomalous zone - boundary ta phonon broadening is a combination of spin - polar phonon ( to mode ) coupling and ta - to phonon coupling .",
    "while the lowest - lying to phonon can be affected by the magnetic order near @xmath8 based on results from the optic measurements , the coupling between the ta and to modes can lead to the anomalies in the ta branches as well .",
    "the coupling is strongest at zone - boundaries because the energy difference between the two modes decreases at large @xmath16 .",
    "this can also explain the lack of energy broadening in the la mode , as the lo phonon energy is much higher at zone boundary and the lo - la coupling there should be significantly weaker .",
    "although the underlying mechanism of this coupling in bifeo@xmath0 is not entirely clear , it is evident that the melting of the magnetic order at @xmath8 correlates with a decrease in the zone - boundary ta phonon lifetime , which suggests the development of a lattice instability .",
    "using neutron time - of - flight spectroscopy we have measured the dispersions of the la , ta@xmath1 , and ta@xmath2 phonon modes for a single crystal of bifeo@xmath0 and determined the elastic constants @xmath34 , @xmath45 , and @xmath28 . the lowest energy to and lo phonon dispersions were also measured , and these are consistent with previous raman and infrared studies .",
    "our results suggest that the zone - center optic mode energy softens slightly on warming .",
    "most importantly , the transverse acoustic phonons measured at the zone boundary clearly broaden in energy when @xmath8 is approached from below .",
    "this indicates that the acoustic phonon modes and magnetic excitations are coupled in this multiferroic material .",
