    "gravitational waves ( gws ) emitted from non - axisymmetric nss are typically described by a signal model which remains relatively stable over years of observation @xcite .",
    "the strain amplitude of the gw is proportional to the ellipticity , @xmath0 , defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the principal moment of inertia of the star , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the moments of inertia about the axes .",
    "the strain amplitude of the gw at the detector , assuming a rigidly rotating triaxial body , is then given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the frequency of the gw , @xmath7 is newton s constant , @xmath8 is the speed of light , and @xmath9 is the distance to the ns . for a star steadily rotating around a principal axis of inertia ,",
    "the frequency of the gw is at twice the rotational frequency of the ns .",
    "the frequency evolves over time as energy is lost due to various dissipation mechanisms , including gw emission .",
    "the first time derivative of the frequency , @xmath10 , is referred to as spindown .",
    "the signal arriving at the detectors is modulated by the motion of the earth around the sun and by the rotation of the earth .",
    "therefore , the signal in the detector reference frame depends on the sky position @xmath11 of the source .",
    "the signal model is described by eight parameters , four phase evolution parameters @xmath12 and four amplitude parameters @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the inclination angle between the line of sight to the ns and its rotation axis , @xmath15 is the polarisation angle and @xmath16 is the initial phase of the signal at a reference time .    in a blind all - sky search",
    "there is also the potential for the detection of signals produced by different source models ( e.g.  @xmath17-modes @xcite ) .",
    "the ability of the all - sky search methods to recover such signals is not examined in this study . here",
    "we assume the signal follows the model described above .",
    "the most sensitive search for cw signals is performed with a fully coherent integration over a large timespan of data .",
    "the computational power required for the integration increases rapidly with the observation time of the data .",
    "when searching for cw signals over a broad frequency and spindown range , and over the whole sky , a fully coherent search quickly becomes computationally unfeasible .",
    "@xcite    this is the motivation for semi - coherent search methods .",
    "the data is split into shorter segments which are searched separately with a coherent method using a coarse grid in parameter space .",
    "the results of the coherent search in each segment are then combined incoherently on a finer search grid . for limited available computing power , these semi - coherent search methods achieve a higher sensitivity than could be achieved with a fully coherent search with a tractable coherence time @xcite .",
    "some searches use segments which are short enough , on the order of 1800s , so that the signal remains within a single fourier frequency bin in each segment . in this case",
    ", the power of the gw signal is extracted with a single fourier transform in each segment .",
    "other searches use longer segment times , hours to days , to increase the snr of the signal in each segment . in this case",
    ", the coherent integration uses the more computationally demanding @xmath18-statistic @xcite to take into account signal modulations .",
    "each search method uses a different variable to quantify snr , so the numeric values of the snr thresholds used by each search can not be directly compared .",
    "the sensitivity of the semi - coherent searches is improved by taking a hierarchical approach .",
    "after the semi - coherent all - sky search , candidates are selected with a threshold which is lower than needed to claim a detection . a refined , more sensitive search",
    "is then performed in the parameter space surrounding each candidate . in principle , the significance of recovered candidates increases in the presence of signal , but not if an original candidate is due to a random noise outlier .",
    "the refinement stages are designed such that any signal passing the first stage has a high probability of being recovered at each following stage .",
    "therefore , the threshold at the first stage ultimately determines the sensitivity of the search .",
    "the deepest searches are performed by the einstein@home pipeline , which benefits from the large computing power provided by the einstein@home project ( section [ sec : eah_method ] ) .",
    "einstein@home searches take many months before the presence of signal can be confirmed or excluded .",
    "there are also quick - look search pipelines which have a much shorter turnaround time .",
    "each all - sky search makes different tradeoffs in the sensitivity vs.  robustness against deviations from the assumed phase models . in the following we",
    "provide a brief overview of the search procedure employed by each pipeline , and the distinguishing characteristics of each method .",
    "+      the powerflux method is described in @xcite .",
    "this search uses 1800-s hann - windowed short fourier transforms ( sfts ) , with an effective coherence length on the order of 900 s. the power from each sft is recorded along the track corresponding to each point in parameter space in the time - frequency plane , accounting for doppler shift and spindown .",
    "the power is then weighted , according to noise and detector antenna pattern , to reduce outliers from noise artifacts and maximise the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the dataset is partitioned into @xmath19 month stretches , and the sum of the weighted power along the track is produced independently for any contiguous combination of these stretches .",
    "high - snr candidates are identified based on their persistence across contiguous stretches of data .",

    "is then applied to coincident candidates .",
    "the most significant cluster candidate per 0.1hz is chosen based on its distance to all other candidates in the toplist , weighted by some significance .",
    "passing candidates are confirmed or rejected with a refinement stage , which covers a reduced parameter space around each candidate with higher resolution in spindown and sky .",
    "+      the time domain @xmath18-statistic search method uses the algorithms and pipeline described in @xcite .",
    "this analysis uses fast fourier transformed data segments of two sidereal days each , split into bands of 0.25hz .",
    "a coherent search is performed in each segment , and candidates with an @xmath18-statistic above threshold are recovered .",
    "recovered candidates around known detector artifacts are vetoed , as are those with similar profiles to stationary noise lines and those close to the polar caps in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the method then searches for coincidences among candidates in each two - day segment .",

    "coincident candidates are counted , within a coincidence window large enough to account for doppler modulation .",
