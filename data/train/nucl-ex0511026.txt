    "the star experiment  @xcite at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory has the unique capability of measuring charged particle and photon multiplicities , precisely and simultaneously , at forward rapidity .",
    "by using this capability we can carry out a systematic study of various aspects of charged particle and photon production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the conventional way of describing particle production in heavy ion collisions is by measuring the particle density in pseudorapidity ( @xmath2 ) . within the framework of certain model assumptions , it provides information on energy density , initial temperature and velocity of sound in the medium formed in the collisions  @xcite .",
    "the widths of the pseudorapidity distributions are sensitive to longitudinal flow and re - scattering effects  @xcite .",
    "the variation of particle density in @xmath2 with collision centrality , expressed in terms of the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath3 ) and/or the number of binary collisions ( @xmath4 ) , can shed light on the relative importance of soft versus hard processes in particle production . the particle density in pseudorapidity",
    "also provides a test ground for various particle production models , such as those based on ideas of parton saturation  @xcite and semi - classical qcd , also known as the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .    at rhic , the particle production mechanism could be different in different regions of pseudorapidity . at midrapidity",
    "a significant increase in charged particle production normalized to the number of participating nucleons has been observed from peripheral to central au + au collisions  @xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the onset of hard scattering processes , which scale with the number of binary collisions . however , the total charged particle multiplicity per participant pair , integrated over the whole pseudorapidity range , is independent of centrality in au + au collisions  @xcite . in the framework of the color glass condensate picture of particle production  @xcite ,",
    "the centrality dependence of particle production at midrapidity reflects the increase of gluon density due to the decrease in the effective strong coupling constant",
    ". it will be interesting to see how the photon and charged particle production scales with the number of participating nucleons and with the number of binary collisions in a common @xmath2 coverage at forward rapidity .",
    "the increase in particle production at midrapidity with increasing center of mass energy has been studied in detail at rhic  @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to see how particle production varies with center of mass energy at forward rapidity .",
    "the experimental data on hadron multiplicity and its energy , centrality and rapidity dependence so far have been consistent with the approach based on ideas of parton saturation .",
    "recently it has been argued that this onset of saturation occurs somewhere in the center of mass energy ( @xmath0 ) range of 17 gev to 130 gev  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the reasons cited for having different mechanisms of particle production at rhic and sps . the present experimental data at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev may help to understand the transition energy for the onset of saturation effects in particle production .",
    "it has been observed that inclusive photon production ( primarily from decay of @xmath5 ) at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev  @xcite follows a centrality independent limiting fragmentation  @xcite behavior .",
    "the inclusive charged particles at 19.6 gev and 200 gev have been observed to follow a centrality dependent behavior of limiting fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that the baryons , an important constituent of inclusive charged particles , are responsible for the observed difference between photons and charged particles  @xcite .",
    "the baryons coming from nuclear remnants and baryon transport , both of which change with centrality , may be the source of the centrality dependent limiting fragmentation for inclusive charged particles .",
    "the role of a new mechanism of baryon production as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite also needs to be understood .",
    "a comparative study of limiting fragmentation of positively and negatively charged particles and photons at the same collision energy and pseudorapidity interval as provided by the present data will help to understand the sources responsible for the observed features . on the theoretical side ,",
    "reproducing the energy , centrality , and species dependence of limiting fragmentation observed in the experimental data can be a good test for various particle production models .",
    "one such attempt to explain the energy dependence of limiting fragmentation phenomena within the framework of cgc has been carried out in ref .",

    "the study of event - by - event fluctuations in the ratio of photon to charged particle multiplicities has also been proposed as a tool to search for production of disoriented chiral condensates ( dccs )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address some of the above physics issues through the first simultaneous measurement of the charged particle and photon multiplicities for au + au collisions at @xmath0 = 62.4 gev in the forward rapidity .",
    "the charged particles are detected using the forward time projection chamber ( ftpc ) and the photons are detected using the photon multiplicity detector ( pmd ) in the star experiment  @xcite .",

    "the ftpcs , pmd , minimum bias trigger and collision centrality selection are briefly described below .",
    "there are two ftpcs ; they are located on each side of the nominal collision vertex , around the beam axis .",
    "they are cylindrical in structure with a diameter of 75 cm and 120 cm in length .",
    "each ftpc has 10 rows of readout pads , called @xmath6 , which in turn are subdivided into 6 sectors with 160 pads per sector .",

    "the novel design of the ftpcs uses a radial drift field , perpendicular to the magnetic field , to achieve a two - track resolution up to 2 mm .",
    "this allows for track reconstruction in the environment of high particle density at forward rapidity . in the present analysis ,",
    "the data from only the ftpc in the positive pseudorapidity region ( 2.9 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath1 3.9 ) is used .",
    "particle production models such as hijing  @xcite and ampt  @xcite show that about 67% of the total charged particles produced fall within the acceptance of each of the ftpcs .",
