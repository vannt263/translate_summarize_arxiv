    "in the yang - mills theory @xcite and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for strong interactions , both the renormalizability and the physical unitarity are satisfied , as demonstrated first in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also known that the massive yang - mills theory satisfies both the renormalizability and the physical unitarity @xcite , if the local gauge invariance is spontaneously broken by the higgs field @xcite and the gauge field acquires the mass through the higgs mechanism by absorbing the nambu - goldstone particle associated with the spontaneous symmetry breakdown . in other words , both the renormalizability and the physical unitarity survive the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry .",
    "it is a long - standing problem @xcite to clarify whether it is possible or not to construct a massive yang - mills model blessed with both the physical unitarity and the renormalizability without the higgs fields , in which the local gauge symmetry is not spontaneously broken . here",
    "the lagrangian is assumed to be written in polynomials of the fields ( we exclude the nonpolynomial type @xcite from our discussions ) .",
    "we are anxious to find such a model for understanding the mass gap and confinement caused by the strong interactions @xcite , since the higgs field does not exist and the color gauge symmetry is kept intact in qcd",
    ". indeed , there are continued attempts to look for an alternative way to describe massive non - abelian gauge fields without the higgs field @xcite .",
    "however , all these efforts were unsuccessful in coping with both renormalizability and unitarity very well : in all the models proposed so far for the massive yang - mills theory without the higgs fields , it seems that the renormalizability and the physical unitarity are not compatible with each other , although there are some models which satisfy either the renormalizability or the physical unitarity .",
    "see @xcite for reviews and @xcite for later developments .    for this purpose , we start once again from the curci - ferrari ( cf ) model @xcite , which is a massive extension of the massless yang - mills theory in the most general renormalizable gauge having both the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) and anti - brst symmetries @xcite . in preceding studies for the cf model @xcite ,",
    "the cf model is proved to be renormalizable , whereas the cf model has been concluded to violate physical unitary @xcite .",
    "however , the preceding studies are restricted to considerations in the perturbation theory .",
    "we need a nonperturbative framework to draw a definite conclusion to this issue .    in a previous paper @xcite , therefore , we have presented a nonperturbative construction of a massive yang - mills field @xmath0 which describes a non - abelian massive spin - one vector boson with the correct physical degrees of freedom without the higgs field @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by finding a nonlinear but local transformation from the original fields in the cf model to the physical massive vector field @xmath0 which is invariant under the modified brst and anti - brst transformation . as an application ,",
    "we have written down a local mass term for the yang - mills field and a dimension - two condensate , which are exactly invariant under the modified brst transformation , lorentz transformation and color rotation .",
    "the resulting massive yang - mills model is regarded as a low - energy effective theory of qcd , which enables us to understand the decoupling solution @xcite characterizing the deep infrared regime responsible for color confinement @xcite .    in a series of papers ,",
    "we give the perturbative and nonperturbative studies on the physical unitarity @xcite in the massive yang - mills theory constructed in the previous paper @xcite . in the ordinary massless",
    "yang - mills theory , the physical unitarity is a first step of understanding color confinement @xcite : in the intermediate state , the contributions from the unphysical gauge modes , i.e. , the longitudinal and scalar modes are exactly canceled by those of the ghost and antighost , which is a special case of the quartet mechanism @xcite .",
    "we clarify how the situation changes in the massive case .",
    "moreover , we clarify the reason for failures of the preceding attempts from our viewpoint .",
    "this paper is the first of the planned papers for discussing the perturbative and nonperturbative physical unitarity in the massive yang - mills theory without the higgs field . in this paper",
    "we present a new perturbative treatment for the physical unitarity after reviewing the general properties of the massive yang - mills theory .",
    "then we reproduce the violation of physical unitarity in a transparent way . in subsequent papers ,",
    "we present a nonperturbative framework to discuss a possible scenario of restoring the physical unitarity in the massive yang - mills theory .    finally , we mention the difference between the unitarity and physical unitarity of the scattering matrix from our point of view . for the tree - level scattering amplitude between two",
    "longitudinally polarized vector bosons , it is known @xcite that the scattering probability as a function of the energy @xmath1 becomes greater than 1 above a critical value @xmath2 , since the amplitude grows with the energy @xmath1 like @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass of the vector boson and @xmath5 is the coupling constant for the self - interactions among vector bosons .",
    "this implies that the perturbative unitarity breaks down in high - energy @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , for the perturbative unitarity to be satisfied , the energy must be restricted to low - energy @xmath7 , which is called the unitarity bound .",
    "( the violation of the unitarity condition for the scattering amplitude in high energy is understood from the nambu - goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite and the low - energy theorem . ) in the higgs sector of weak interactions in the standard model , the higgs particle exists and the exchange of the higgs particle affects the amplitude so that the amplitude approaches a constant at energies far above the higgs pole .",
    "consequently , the higgs mass must be less than an upper bound . if such new physical degrees of freedom do not exist , this behavior is not modified and the unitarity violation in high energy can not be avoided in the massive yang - mills theory , since the nakanishi - lautrup ( nl ) auxiliary field can be integrated out and the ghosts can play no role in the tree - level amplitude . in our works , we regard the cf model as a low - energy effective theory of the yang - mills theory to be valid in the region @xmath7 for discussing color confinement .",
    "we restrict our examination on the physical unitarity to a sufficiently low - energy region below a few gev to evade the unitarity violation and consider only the physical unitarity , i.e. , unphysical mode cancellation in our papers .",
    "therefore , the well - known fact about the unitarity violation in the above does not contradict our research on the physical unitarity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii , we introduce a massive yang - mills theory without the higgs field and define the cf model as a special case .",
    "the cf model is not invariant under the usual brst and anti - brst transformations .",
    "however , the cf model can be made invariant by modifying the brst and anti - brst transformations .",
    "the cost of introducing the mass term is the violation of nilpotency of the modified brst and anti - brst transformations .",
    "we point out an important fact that even the modified brst ( anti - brst)-invariant quantity depends on a parameter @xmath8 in the @xmath9 case .",
    "this should be compared with the @xmath10 case , in which @xmath8 is a gauge - fixing parameter and the brst - invariant quantity does not depend on @xmath8 , which means that the physics does not depend on @xmath8 in the @xmath10 case .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath9 .    in section iii",
    ", we summarize the result obtained in the previous paper @xcite on a nonperturbative construction of a non - abelian massive yang - mills field @xmath0 under the requirements which guarantee ( i ) the modified brst ( and anti - brst ) invariance , ( ii ) correct degrees of freedom for describing a massive spin - one particle , and ( iii ) the expected transformation rule under color rotation .",
    "we write down the massive vector field explicitly in terms of the original yang - mills field , the faddeev - popov ( fp ) ghost field , antighost field and the nl field in the cf model .    in section iv , we give a perturbative framework of the cf model in terms of the new field variable @xmath0 .",
    "we give the feynman rules up to the order @xmath5 .    in section v",
    ", we check the physical unitarity in the massless yang - mills theory . using a simple example",
    ", it is demonstrated in the lowest order of perturbation theory that the physical unitarity follows from the cancellation among unphysical modes : the longitudinal and scalar modes of the yang - mills field together with the fp ghost and antighost .    in section",
    "vi , we review a conventional argument for the violation of physical unitarity in the massive yang - mills theory without the higgs field . using a simple example corresponding to the previous section ,",
    "we show that the violation of physical unitarity follows from the incomplete cancellation among unphysical modes : the scalar mode with the fp ghost and antighost .",
    "in section vii , we begin with a new analysis on the physical unitarity of the cf model based on a novel framework using the field @xmath0 given in section iii . in this section , we give a new perturbative analysis using the result of section v. we confirm that the physical unitarity is indeed violated in the cf model in the framework of the perturbation theory in the coupling constant .",
    "it is easily seen that the violation of physical unitarity follows from the incomplete cancellation among unphysical modes : the nl field ( corresponding to the scalar mode ) with the fp ghost and antighost .",
    "we discuss how to avoid the violation of physical unitarity within the perturbative framework .    in the final section ,",
    "we summarize the results and mention the perspective on the next work .    in appendix",

    "<S> in a series of papers , we examine the physical unitarity in a massive yang - mills theory without the higgs field in which the color gauge symmetry is not spontaneously broken and kept intact . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose , we use a new framework proposed in the previous paper kondo [ arxiv:1208.3521 ] based on a nonperturbative construction of a non - abelian field describing a massive spin - one vector boson field , which enables us to perform the perturbative and nonperturbative studies on the physical unitarity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a new perturbative treatment for the physical unitarity after giving the general properties of the massive yang - mills theory . then we reproduce the violation of physical unitarity in a transparent way . </S>",
    "<S> this paper is a preliminary work to the subsequent papers in which we present a nonperturbative framework to propose a possible scenario of restoring the physical unitarity in the curci - ferrari model . </S>"
