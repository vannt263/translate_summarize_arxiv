    "in the last few years , we have witnessed a flurry of far - reaching experimental results , among which are the neutrino oscillation data @xcite , data on direct cp - violation such as @xmath2 @xcite and upper bounds on flavour - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) rare decays of the kaons . on the one hand",
    ", the neutrino oscillation data clearly points to possible physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . on the other hand , it is still not clear if the new results on @xmath3 , which differ roughly by a factor of two from present calculations within the sm , imply any new physics since the aforementioned calculations are still plagued with non - perturbative uncertainties . for the kaon s",
    "fcnc rare decays , the experimental situation is still far from giving evidences of physics beyond the sm or to confirm the sm itself .",
    "nevertheless , whatever new physics , which might be responsible for giving rise to neutrino masses , could , in principle , affect the quark sector , and hence , also quantities such as @xmath3 or the branching ratios of the kaon s fcnc rare decays .",
    "if this is the case , results from the quark sector could then be used to put constraints on the lepton sector itself since it is possible that both sectors have a common set of parameters , a desirable feature of any model which purports to deal with issues of fermion masses .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore this possible connection between the two sectors .",
    "the subject of neutrino masses has been invigorated in the last few years due to new results on neutrino oscillations which suggested the possibility of a non - vanishing mass for the neutrinos .",
    "models have been ( and are still being ) built to try to describe these oscillations . in a large number of cases , efforts were mainly concentrated on the type of neutrino mass matrices which could `` explain '' the oscillation data , with very little attempt made in trying to connect that kind of physics to the hadronic sector . however , it is perfectly reasonable to expect that the two sectors are somehow deeply connected , and that a constraint from one sector can give rise to constraints on the other sector .",
    "this particular connection will be the subject of the present manuscript .",
    "this paper is an extension to the quark sector of a model of neutrino mass presented in ref",
    ". @xcite . in consequence",
    ", we shall show that there is a set of parameters which appear in both sectors , and that the constraints obtained in the quark sector have interesting implications on the neutrino sector .",
    "in particular , we shall use recent results from limits on various rare decays to constrain a common parameter which appears in both sectors .",
    "( as we will show , because this common parameter is real , there will be no new contributions from our model to @xmath3 . )",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , we present our model for the quark sector based on a previous model for the neutrino sector @xcite .",
    "we then proceed to enumerate and compute various fcnc operators which arise in this model .",
    "these operators are important in the analysis of various rare decays .",
    "finally , we will use these fcnc operators in the computation of their contributions to the aforementioned quantities , and set constraints on the parameters of the model . using these constraints , we look at the question of how they would affect the neutrino sector",
    ". we will also show at the end of the paper that there are some interesting correlations between the value of the branching ratio for @xmath4 and the mass of the weak - singlet quarks and charged leptons which appear in our model . when these particles are `` light '' enough to be produced at future accelerators , the branching ratio for @xmath4 is too small , of order @xmath5 , to be detected , while for a branching ratio which could conceivably be measured in a not - too - distant future , e.g. of order @xmath6 , the masses of these singlet quarks and leptons will be too large , a few hundreds of tevs or more , to be produced by earthbound laboratories .",
    "the model used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the lepton sector is summarized in appendix a. ( a quick look at that appendix will help with the notations and particle content . ) in this section , we will simply write down the part of the lagrangian for the quark sector which is relevant to the construction of various fcnc operators .",
    "first of all , the common link between the quark and lepton sectors is in the scalar sector .",
    "these are the sm higgs field @xmath7 and the family symmetry higgs field @xmath8 .",
    "as we shall see below , it is these scalars which `` transmit information '' from the quark to the lepton sector and vice versa . in particular , as can be seen from appendix a , @xmath8 provides the common set of parameters which appears in the two sectors .",
    "the generalization from the lepton sector to the quark sector necessitates the introduction of a new set of vector - like quarks , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a color index , in perfect analogy with the leptonic vector - like fermions , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . as we shall see below",
    ", these vector - like quarks can have masses as low as a couple of hundred gev s , making them very attractive for potential discoveries at the lhc .",
    "we shall come back to this interesting issue in the last section of the manuscript .",
    "the particle content and quantum numbers of the model are listed in table 1 .",
    "notice that , among the scalars listed in that table , there is one which does not have the appropriate quantum numbers to be able to couple directly to the quarks : @xmath16 .",
    "the gauge structure of the model ( for both quarks and leptons ) is given by : @xmath17    where @xmath18 applies only to the right - handed neutrinos , and @xmath19 is the family symmetry .",
    "the form of the quark yukawa lagrangian is similar to the one from the lepton sector ( appendix a ) , with the introduction of the following new parameters :    @xmath20    the quark yukawa lagrangian takes the form    @xmath21    with the important difference with respect to the lepton sector in that there is no coupling between the quarks and the scalar @xmath16 before symmetry breaking .",
    "after symmetry breaking , the mass eigenstates are linear combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and vice versa , as shown below and in appendix a.    the way the fcnc processes take place in the quark sector is identical to the way they operate in the lepton sector i.e. via loop diagrams . in the sm , as it is well known , the flavour diagonal structure of the basic vertices involving @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 forbids the appearance of fcnc processes at the tree level .",
    "however the fcnc processes can happen at one loop or higher order level , mediated by a combination of flavour changing charged currents coupled to the w s .",
    "the fact that these processes take place only as loop effects makes them particularly useful for testing the quantum structure of the theory and in search for physics beyond the sm . in our model , beside the ways in which fcnc processes can happen in the sm , it can also happen because of the couplings of quarks of different flavour to the same vector - like fermion f and to the ng bosons @xmath27 and the pseudo ng bosons @xmath28 .",
    "this is made possible by the mixings among the ng bosons @xmath27 and the pseudo ng bosons @xmath29 with different family indices @xmath12 and @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the relevant scalar mass eigenstates by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , in terms of which we can express the states entering the yukawa lagrangian by    @xmath31    the states @xmath27 are the ng bosons which are absorbed by the corresponding family gauge bosons .",
    "when the ng bosons get mixed , there will be mass mixings among the corresponding family gauge bosons .",
    "if we denote by @xmath32 the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes the family gauge bosons mass matrix ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we can express the states @xmath33 , corresponding to the longitudinal components of the gauge boson mass eigenstates , in terms of the mass eigenstates @xmath27    @xmath34    with @xmath32 given by    @xmath35    this mechanism , introduced to describe neutrino mass splitting in the neutral lepton sector , gives the following terms in the yukawa lagrangian :    @xmath36    @xmath37    where we assume that the same @xmath32 diagonalizes also the mass matrix of the pseudo ng @xmath38 ( ref .",
    "it is important to notice here that @xmath39 and @xmath40 , whose mass eigenstates are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , see eq .",
    "[ h4h4 ] , are not coupled to the quarks of the first three families .",
    "this implies that they will not propagate in the loops of the diagrams describing processes with external quarks of the first three generations .",
    "in this paper we will look only at processes involving the quarks of the first three families and so we will not care about the presence in our model of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where    @xmath43    in the following we will present the expressions of the effective vertices for fcnc processes mediated by @xmath44 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 . there is no extra effective vertex with the sm higgs in our model because the vector - like fermions do not couple to the sm higgs field .",
    "we will also compare these expressions with the corresponding ones from the sm .    for all the effective vertices , the expressions will be given in terms of the linear combination    @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the contributions to the effective vertices when the particles propagating in the loops are respectively the ng bosons @xmath33 and the pseudo ng bosons @xmath48 . from the lepton sector",
    "we have estimated @xmath49 to be    @xmath50    with @xmath51 being the @xmath19 gauge coupling . @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of @xmath23 and @xmath22 respectively , @xmath54 and @xmath55 the masses of the vector - like fermions introduced in the lepton sector , and @xmath56 the central value for the masses of the family gauge bosons .",
    "taking @xmath57 , and , for the masses , the values required in the lepton sector to have a proper value for the neutrino of the @xmath58 generation , @xmath49 turns out to be much smaller than unity .",
    "this makes the contribution to @xmath59 due to the pseudo ng bosons negligible , being suppresed by the factor @xmath60 . in the following",
    "we will give only the expressions for the contributions due to the ng bosons @xmath33 .",
    "all the expressions that will be given for the effective vertices will have to be multiplied by the factor @xmath61 .",
    "we will focus on the expressions for the effective vertices in the transition @xmath62 .",
    "to calculate the z effective vertex we have to sum up all the contributions coming from the different vector - like fermions propagating in the loop diagrams .",
    "we will present separately the expressions for the amplitude due respectively to the @xmath63 and @xmath14 vector - like fermions .",
    "we remark here that @xmath63 is the down component of a doublet of @xmath64 while @xmath14 is a singlet of @xmath64 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "because the dominant terms of the amplitudes are proportional to @xmath65 of the vector - like fermions , the contribution due to @xmath66 is singled out . the contribution from @xmath14",
    "will be suppressed by the factor @xmath67 with @xmath68 being the scale of breaking of the family symmetry .",
