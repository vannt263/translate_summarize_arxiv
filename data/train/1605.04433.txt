    "in the paper  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) the second author has started to carry over the results by the first author and victor petrov @xcite on overgroups of classical groups in vector representations , to the exceptional groups @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , in minimal representations . from the very start , it became apparent , that one the key steps necessary to carry through a reduction proof in the spirit of the cited papers , would be an _",

    "we have completely solved this problem for the group @xmath11 , whereas in @xcite this problem is solved for the group @xmath15 . in the present paper , we consider in the same spirit the group of type @xmath16 .",

    "[ sec : construction ] we explicitly construct an ideal @xmath17 in the ring of integer polynomials @xmath18 $ ] , generated by 133 quadratic forms @xmath19 , which has the following property . denote by @xmath20 the set of @xmath4-linear transformations , preserving the ideal @xmath17 , see   [ sec : construction ] for the precise definitions .",
    "the first main objective of the present paper , is to prove the following result . here",

    "[ thm : g_i ] there is an isomorphism @xmath23 of affine groups schemes over @xmath24 .",
    "this result can be viewed as an explicit description of the _ extended _ simply connected chevalley ",
    "demazure group scheme @xmath25 of type @xmath26 , by equations .",
    "this scheme was constructed in  @xcite , see also @xcite and   [ sec : extended_group ] below . for @xmath26 the most straightforward way to visualize the scheme @xmath25 is to view it as the levi factor of the parabolic subscheme of type @xmath27 in @xmath28 , where @xmath29   is the usual simply connected chevalley ",
    "demazure groups scheme of type @xmath30 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite as for the scheme - theoretic definition of parabolic subgroups and their levi factors , see also  @xcite for the above identification itself .",
    "our results are intimately related to the description of @xmath7 as the stabilizer of a system of four - linear forms on @xmath31 .",
    "namely , in  @xcite we gave a new construction of a four - linear form @xmath32 and a symplectic form @xmath33 , invariant under the action of the group @xmath7 .",
    "we reproduce the construction of the form @xmath34 in   [ sec : invariants ] .",
    "the bulk of our system of quadratic forms consists of the second partial derivatives of the [ regular part of ] the form  @xmath34 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath7 is precisely the group of linear transformations preserving both @xmath34 and @xmath35 : @xmath36 it is only marginally more complicated to describe the extended group @xmath37 in terms of the forms @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "namely , let @xmath38    [ thm : g_fh ] there are isomorphisms @xmath39 , @xmath40 of affine groups schemes over @xmath24 .",
    "this theorem readily implies that the above definition of the extended group @xmath37 can be simplified as follows .",

    "now we are all set to state the main result of the present paper .",
    "observe , that all normalizers and transporters here are taken in the general linear group @xmath14 .",
    "[ thm : normaliser ] let @xmath4 be an arbitrary commutative ring",
    ". then @xmath51    the interrelation of theorems  [ thm : g_i ] and  [ thm : normaliser ] and the general scheme of their proof are exactly the same , as in our previous paper@xcite , and some familiarity with @xcite ( at least with the introduction and   5 ) would be _ extremely _ useful to facilitate understanding the proofs in the present paper .",
    "observe , that after the publication of @xcite its subject matter became _ unexpectedly _ pertinent .",
    "namely , recently elena bunina reconsidered one of the central classical problems of the whole theory , description of [ abstract ] automorphisms of chevalley groups , without any such simplifying assumptions as @xmath4 being noetherian , or @xmath52 being invertible in @xmath4 . for local rings",
    "she _ almost _ succeeded in proving that all automorphisms of the group @xmath53 are standard , see  @xcite , etc .",
    "namely , she established that an arbitrary automorphism of the adjoint elementary chevalley group is the product of ring , inner and graph automorphisms .",
    "there is a catch , though , that with her approach the inner automorphisms are taken not in the adjoint chevalley group @xmath54 itself , but rather in the corresponding general linear group @xmath55 . in this context , the fact that the abstract and algebraic normalizers coincide , means precisely that all such conjugations are genuine inner automorphisms .",
    "this means that modulo the results of @xcite an analogue of the results of @xcite and the present paper , for adjoint _ representations _",
    "would then imply that all automorphisms of chevalley groups of types @xmath56 over local rings  and thus also arbitrary commutative rings  are standard in the usual sense .",
    "we are convinced that our results on the equations in adjoint representations @xcite allow to obtain the requisite results for the adjoint case . in cooperation with elena bunina",
    ", we hope to work out the details shortly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we recall the basic notation pertaining to the extended chevalley group of type @xmath16 . in",
    " 3 we discuss the invariant four - linear forms , and in   4 we construct an invariant system of quadrics , which in this case is _ significantly _ trickier than in the case of @xmath9 . in   5 we prove that this system of quadrics is indeed invariant .",
    "the technical core of the paper are  ",
    "610 , which are directly devoted to the proof of theorems  [ thm : g_i ] , [ thm : g_fh ] and  [ thm : normaliser ] . due to the limited space",
    ", we do not explicitly list the resulting equations here , this will be done in a subsequent publication .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite as for the general context of the present paper , and further references . in the papers @xcite one can find many further details pertaining to chevalley groups over rings , and many further related references .    nevertheless , to fix the requisite notation , for reader s convenience below we reproduce with minor modifications   1 of  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath30 be a reduced irreducible root system of rank @xmath57 ( in the main body of the paper we assume that @xmath26 ) , and @xmath58 be a lattice intermediate between the root lattice @xmath59 and the weight lattice @xmath60 .",
    "we fix and order on @xmath30 and denote by @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 the corresponding sets of fundamental , positive , and negative roots .",
    "our numbering of the fundamental roots follows  @xcite . by @xmath64",
    "we denote the maximal root of the system @xmath30 with respect to this order .",
    "for instance , for @xmath26 we have @xmath65 .",
    "denote by @xmath66 the set of dominant weights with respect to this order . recall that it consists of all nonnegative integral linear combinations of the fundamental weights @xmath67 , for this order .",
    "finally , @xmath68 denotes the weyl group of the root system @xmath30 .",
    "further , let @xmath4 be a commutative ring with 1 .",
    "it is classically known that , starting with this data , one can construct the _ chevalley group _ @xmath69 , which is the group of @xmath4-points of an affine group scheme @xmath70 , known as the _ chevalley  demazure scheme_. for the problems we consider , it suffices to limit ourselves with the simply connected ( alias , universal ) groups , for which @xmath71 . for the simply connected groups we usually omit any reference to the lattice @xmath58 and simply write @xmath72 or , when we wish to stress that the group in question is simply connected , @xmath49 .",
    "the adjoint group , for which @xmath73 , is denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "fix a split maximal torus @xmath74 in @xmath72 and a parametrization of the unipotent root subgroups @xmath75 , @xmath76 , elementary with respect to this torus .",
    "let @xmath77 be the elementary unipotent element corresponding to @xmath76 and @xmath78 in this parametrization .",
    "the group @xmath79 is called an ( elementary ) _ root subgroup _ , and the group @xmath80 generated by all elementary root subgroups is called the ( absolute ) _ elementary subgroup _ of the chevalley group @xmath72 .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "apart from the usual chevalley group , we also consider the corresponding _ extended _ chevalley group @xmath81 , which plays the same role with respect to @xmath72 as the general linear group @xmath82 plays with respect to the special linear group @xmath83 .",
    "_ adjoint _ extended groups were constructed in the original paper by chevalley @xcite .",
    "it is somewhat harder to construct _ simply connected _ extended groups because , unlike the adjoint case , here one must increase the dimension of the maximal torus .",
    "a unified elementary construction was only proposed by berman and moody in @xcite . however ,",
    "for the case of @xmath84 that we consider in the present paper , this group can be naturally viewed as a subgroup of the usual chevalley group @xmath85 , viz .",
    "@xmath86    in the majority of the existing constructions , the chevalley group @xmath72 arises together with an action on the _ weyl module _ @xmath87 , for some dominant weight @xmath88 .",
    "denote by @xmath89 the _ multiset _ of weights of the module @xmath87 _ with multiplicities_. in the present paper we consider the group @xmath90 in the minimal representation with the highest weight @xmath91 .",
    "this is a microweight representation , in particular the multiplicities of all weights are equal to 1 .",
    "fix an admissible base @xmath92 , @xmath93 , of the module @xmath94 .",
    "we conceive a vector @xmath95 , @xmath96 , as a coordinate _",
    "@xmath97 , @xmath93 .    : natural numbering . ]    in figure  1 we reproduce the weight diagram of the representation @xmath98 , together with the _ natural _ numbering of weights , used in the sequel . in this",
    "numbering the weights are listed according to the order determined by the fundamental root system @xmath99 . on the picture , the highest weight is the left - most one .",
    "the weight diagram of the representation @xmath98 is symmetric , and this symmetry is reflected in the numbering , the weights are numbered as @xmath100 . often , to save space",
    "we write @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for lists of weight in the dynkin form , and in the hyperbolic form , as well as other common numberings .",
    "recall , that in the weight diagram two weights are joined by an edge if their difference is a _",
    "fundamental _ root .",
    "the weight graph is constructed similarly , only that now two weights are joined by an edge provided their difference is a _ positive _ root . in the sequel",
    "we denote by @xmath103 the distance between two weights @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the weight graph . in other words , @xmath106 if @xmath107 ; @xmath108 if @xmath109 ; @xmath110 if @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the sum of two roots of @xmath30 ; and finally , @xmath114 otherwise .    the above realization of the representation @xmath98 as an internal chevalley module inside the chevalley group of type @xmath115 provides a natural identification of the set of weights @xmath116 with the set of roots of the root system @xmath115 , in whose expansion with respect to the fundamental roots the root @xmath117 occurs with the coefficient @xmath118 .",
    "obviously , the roots of the root system @xmath16 itself are identified with those roots of @xmath115 in whose expansion @xmath117 occurs with the coefficient 0 . there is a unique root of @xmath115 , in whose expansion @xmath117 occurs with the coefficient @xmath52 : it is the maximal root @xmath119 . in the sequel",
    "we always view both the roots of @xmath16 and the wights of our representation as the roots of @xmath115 .",
    "we denote by @xmath120 the natural inner product defined on the linear span of @xmath115 .",
    "it is convenient to normalize it in such a way that all roots have length @xmath118 .",
    "then for any @xmath121 the inner product @xmath122 can take values @xmath123 , @xmath124 or @xmath125 . with these conventions , the distance @xmath103 between the weights @xmath126 equals    * @xmath123 if @xmath127 ; * @xmath118 if @xmath128 ; * @xmath52 if @xmath129 ; * @xmath130 if @xmath131 ( and then @xmath132 ) .",
    "thus , for any weight @xmath93 there exists a unique weight at distance @xmath130 ; this is the weight @xmath133 , which will be denoted by @xmath134 .    in @xcite one",
    "can find many further details as to how to recover , from this diagram alone , the action of root unipotents @xmath77 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , the signs of structure constants , the shape and signs of equations , etc . these and other such similar items are tabulated in @xcite .",
    "formally , an explicit knowledge of these things is not necessary to understand the proofs produced in the present paper .",
    "however , in reality all calculations in   3 , 4 , 79 , were performed with the heavy use of weight diagrams , and could hardly be possible without them .    over a field , and in general over a semilocal ring ,",
    "the extended chevalley group @xmath137 is generated by the usual chevalley group @xmath90 and the weight elements @xmath138 , @xmath139 . in the natural numbering of weight",
    "the element @xmath140 acts on the module @xmath141 as follows : @xmath142 here we assume that the weights are linearly ordered as follows : @xmath143 ) . observe , that the exponent of @xmath144 increases by 1 each time we cross an edge marked @xmath145 .",
    "in our paper @xcite the simply connected chevalley group of type @xmath9 acting on the @xmath146-dimensional module @xmath147 was identified with the isometry group of a three - linear form @xmath148 .",
    "there is a similar , but much more complicated description of the simply connected chevalley group of type @xmath16 acting on the @xmath149-dimensional module @xmath150 . in this case , to determine the group one needs to invariants , one of degree 2 , and another one of degree 4 .",
    "first of all , the module @xmath94 is self - dual and carries a unimodular symplectic form @xmath35 .",
    "further , there exists a four - linear form @xmath151 such that @xmath43 can be identified with the full isometry group of the pair @xmath35 , @xmath34 , in other words , with the group of all @xmath152 such that @xmath153 and @xmath154 for all @xmath155 .",
    "the similarities of this pair of forms define the _ extended _ chevalley group @xmath137 ( see theorem  [ thm : g_fh ] ) .",
    "it is obvious how to construct @xmath35 .",
    "construction of the fourth degree invariant is considerably more complicated , and classically one constructs not the four - linear form @xmath34 , but rather the corresponding quartic .",
    "apparently , dickson has not noticed an explicit connection with the group of type @xmath16 itself . otherwise , chevalley groups could had been discovered some 50 years earlier ! ] . the fact that the group @xmath43 preserves a form of degree 4 in 56 variables , was first observed by e.  cartan , at least in characteristic  0 , but his explicit construction of this form was flawed ( probably , it was just a misprint ) .",
    "a very elegant construction of such an invariant over a field @xmath156 of characteristic distinct from 2 was given by h.  freudenthal .",
    "namely , he identifies the module @xmath94 with the space @xmath157 , where @xmath158 is the set of antisymmetric @xmath159 matrices , and considers the following symplectic inner product and form of degree 4 : @xmath160 now , for all characteristics distinct from 2 , one can identify the isometry group of this pair with the simply - connected chevalley group @xmath43 of type @xmath16 over @xmath156 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the constructions of the above form in the papers by m.  aschbacher and b.  cooperstein is somewhat different . actually , in @xcite the form is constructed in terms of @xmath161 ( the gist of this construction is expressed by the partition @xmath162 ) , whereas the construction in @xcite is closer to freudenthal s original construction , and is phrased in terms of @xmath163 ( where @xmath164 ) .",
    "the isometry group of the form @xmath165 is generated by @xmath43 and a diagonal element of order 2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are no serious complications in characteristic @xmath166 , whereas characteristic 3 requires some extra - care .",
    "however , in characteristic 2 this approach is almost immediately blocked by serious obstacles .",
    "obviously , the above construction fails .",
    "apparently , in characteristic 2 there are whatsoever no non - trivial symmetric @xmath43-invariant four - linear forms on @xmath94 , ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that in characteristic 2 the four - linear form @xmath167 obtained by the squaring of the symplectic form , becomes symmetric , which is not the case in characteristics @xmath168 .",
    "actually , in characteristic 2 m.  aschbacher @xcite constructs a four - linear @xmath43-invariant form @xmath45 , which is symmetric with respect to the _ even _ permutations .",
    "there are other constructions of the form @xmath165 , most notably a construction by r.  brown @xcite , which works in characteristics @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath94 be a space with a non - degenerate inner product . then to define a three - linear form on @xmath94 is essentially the same as to define on @xmath94 an algebra structure .",
    "by the same token , to define a four - linear form on @xmath94 is essentially the same as to define on @xmath94 a _ ternary _ algebra structure .",
    "indeed , there exists a remarkable ternary algebra of dimension 56 , constructed in terms of the exceptional 27-dimensional jordan algebra @xmath170 ( see  @xcite and references there ) .",
    "this algebra consists of @xmath171 matrices over @xmath170 with scalar diagonal entries , @xmath172 .",
    "the orbits of the group @xmath173 on the 56-dimensional module are classified in @xcite in the absolute case , in @xcite for finite fields , and in @xcite for arbitrary fields .",
    "basically , these orbits are described in terms of the four - linear form .",
    "again characteristics 2 and 3 require separate analysis , and to take care of all details one has to use the notion of 4-forms , introduced by m.  aschbacher ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "essentially , a 4-form is a form of degree 4 together with all of its polarizations . for simplicity , assume that @xmath174",
    ". then a vector @xmath175 is called _ singular _ , if @xmath176 for all @xmath177 ; _ brilliant _ , if @xmath178 for all @xmath179 ; and _ luminous _ if @xmath180 .",
    "otherwise , i.e.  if @xmath181 , the vector @xmath182 is called _ dark_. the orbits of the group @xmath43 on @xmath94 are as follows : 0 , non - zero singular vectors , non - singular brilliant vectors , luminous vectors that are non brilliant , and , finally , one or several orbits of dark vectors , parametrized by @xmath183 ( these last orbits fuse to one orbit under the action of the _ extended _ chevalley group @xmath184 of type @xmath16 ) .    the feeling that @xmath16 stands in the same relation to @xmath9 , as @xmath9 itself stands to @xmath185 , suggests the following definition of the form of degree 4 on @xmath94 .",
    "take a base vector @xmath92 .",
    "then the vectors @xmath186 , @xmath110 , generates a 27-dimensional module @xmath187 , that supports the cubic form related to @xmath9 .",
    "let us define _ tetrads _ as quadruples @xmath188 of pair - wise orthogonal weights .",
    "let @xmath189 and @xmath190 be the sets of ordered and unordered tetrads , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath191 , whereas @xmath192 .",
    "now , we can tentatively define the form @xmath193 of degree 4 by setting @xmath194 , where the sum is taken over all @xmath195 , while the signs are determined by the condition that the resulting form is invariant under the action of the extended weyl group @xmath196 .",
    "here , one should be slightly more cautious then in the case of @xmath9 , since now , in addition to the two possible cases that occurred there , the following possibility occurs : @xmath197 moves all 4 weights of a tetrad , two of them in positive and the other two in negative direction , in which case the signs does not change .",
    "nevertheless , an expression of the sign in terms of @xmath198 still works .",
    "this is essentially the same , as to define the four - linear form @xmath199 by @xmath200 , for a tetrad @xmath201 and by @xmath202 otherwise . by construction , this form is invariant under the action of @xmath196 , and we only have to verify that it is invariant under the action of the root subgroup @xmath75 , for some root @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case .",
    "namely , for any tetrad @xmath188 and any elementary root unipotent @xmath203 the following formula holds @xmath204 as it happens , though , there exist quadruples of weights that are not tetrads , for which the right hand side equals 0 , whereas the left hand side is distinct from 0 . for instance , take the four weights @xmath205 such that @xmath206 are weights , and together the 8 above weights form a cube ( in other words , the corresponding weight diagrams is the tensor product of three copies @xmath207 , see @xcite ) .",
    "then one of the weights @xmath208 will be adjacent with the other two , say , @xmath209 , so that @xmath202 .    at the same time , decomposing the expression @xmath210 by linearity , we get 8 summands , of which exactly one , namely @xmath211 , corresponds to a tetrad , and equals @xmath212 .",
    "thus , the form @xmath199 is not preserved by the action of @xmath75 .    in itself , this is not yet critical , since one can hope to save the situation by throwing in another weyl orbit of monomials .",
    "this is , however , exactly the point where real problems start . as a matter of fact , in the above counter - example",
    "throwing in another orbit of monomials will produce _ two _ non - zero extra summands , so that the resulting correction will be a multiple of 2 .",
    "this means that one can not define an invariant form of degree 4 by setting its values on the tetrads to be equal to @xmath212 , one should start with @xmath213 instead .",
    "this is precisely where _ serious _ trouble starts . in characteristic",
    "@xmath214 the above construction is _ essentially _ correct , in the sense that it tells how the _ relevant _ part of an invariant form of degree 4 looks like , responsible for the reduction to @xmath9 .",
    "let us fix a vector @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath215 consists of two parts : the form @xmath199 , as defined above , and another part , introduced for the resulting form to be @xmath43-invariant .",
    "this second part has the form @xmath216 and does not say anything beyond the fact that our group preserves the usual symplectic form .    in the works by jacob lurie @xcite and the second author @xcite",
    ", these difficulties arising in characteristic 2 were sorted out in a systematic way , but the resulting four - linear forms are not anymore symmetric .",
    "namely , let @xmath217 be the lie algebra of type @xmath115 ; recall that @xmath218 is the highest root of @xmath115 .",
    "the coefficient with which @xmath117 occurs in the expansion of a root @xmath219 with respect to the fundamental roots , is called the @xmath117-height of @xmath220 and can only take values @xmath221 ,",
    "@xmath222 , @xmath123 , @xmath118 , @xmath52 .",
    "this defines the following length 5 grading of the algebra @xmath217 : @xmath223 the 56-dimensional space @xmath224 has a base consisting of the elementary root elements @xmath225 , where @xmath220 runs over the roots of @xmath117-height @xmath118 , i.e.  the weights of @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath226 be four weights of @xmath141 .",
    "clearly , the element @xmath227,e_\\mu],e_\\nu],e_\\rho]\\ ] ] has @xmath117-weight @xmath52 , so that the resulting element is a multiple of @xmath228 . denote the corresponding scalar coefficient by @xmath229 and consider the four - linear form @xmath230 obviously , this form is invariant under the action of the group @xmath90 on the module @xmath141 .",
    "it is well known that in any representation of the group @xmath43 the orbit @xmath231 of the highest weight vector @xmath232 is an intersection of quadrics  @xcite . here , as a motivation for the next section , we explicitly describe the equations defining the orbit of @xmath232 for the microweight representation of @xmath16 . for the microweight representation of @xmath9",
    "this was done in  [ 11 ] .",
    "of course , for these cases the corresponding equations were found by h.  freudenthal and j.  tits more than 40 years ago ( see also @xcite and references there ) , but again we wish to show how to recover the equations directly from the weight diagram .",
    "let @xmath233 for @xmath9 or @xmath234 for @xmath16 , the case of @xmath235 is dual to the first case .",
    "we use the same interpretation of the modules as in   1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath236 , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 .",
    "the group @xmath240 acts on @xmath241 , @xmath242 by conjugation .",
    "since we are only interested in the equations satisfied by the orbit @xmath231 , we can assume that @xmath243 is an ( algebraically closed ) field - functors , or their analogues , can be non - trivial , that we do not discuss here . ] .",
    "in both cases one can take @xmath244 as the highest weight vector , where @xmath245 is the maximal root of @xmath16 , or the unique submaximal root of @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "recall that the vector @xmath246 is now viewed as the product @xmath247 , @xmath242 . in the case of @xmath16",
    "this product is considered modulo @xmath248 , the root subgroup corresponding to the maximal root of @xmath115 .",
