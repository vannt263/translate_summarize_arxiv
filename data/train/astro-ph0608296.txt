    "however , the decline of the perturbation amplitude with radius is too slow to be due to a current source within saturn , so this interpretation can not be correct . instead , we propose that the non - axisymmetric component of saturn s external magnetic field is generated by rotationally driven convection in the planet s magnetosphere",

    "the topic has an extensive history , but this is not the place to review it .",

    "we have done nothing more than to apply what we learned from reading the literature .",
    "equations governing rotationally driven convection were formulated by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "many applications have been made to the outward transport of mass from the io plasma torus .",
    "@xcite includes a clear discussion of different approaches to this problem .",
    "progress in solving the equations referred to above has been slow .",
    "in retrospect , this is not surprising .",
    "they are nonlinear set , which probably precludes finding analytic solutions .",
    "moreover , realistic applications are faced with including a continuous supply of plasma along with boundary conditions that simulate its loss to the solar wind at the magnetopause .",
    "perhaps the most ambitious attempt at a realistic solution is that by @xcite who applied the rice convection model to the io torus .",
    "they investigated an initial value problem , the instability of a torus of finite width .",
    "an active source of plasma was not included .",
    "long fingers were found to grow radially outward from the torus .",
    "this is not surprising .",
    "the initial state is analogous to that of a heavier fluid resting on top of a lighter one which is rayleigh - taylor unstable .",
    "but unlike the standard rayleigh - taylor instability which takes place for constant gravitational acceleration , the instability of the plasma torus is driven by centrifugal acceleration which increases linearly outward .",
    "this increase allows narrow fingers to run away from the more slowly developing , thicker modes that might otherwise subsume them .    in the absence of anything",
    "better , we adopt a simplified picture of steady - state magnetospheric convection .",
    "a tongue of plasma flows outward from a torus of neutral material that is escaping from enceladus .",
    "plasma is continuously created inside the torus by ionization of this material .",
    "it exits in a tongue which flows outward . except within the tongue ,",
    "flux tubes outside the torus drift inward due to `` fringing '' electric fields surrounding the tongue region .",
    "as they cross the torus , the inward - moving tubes are loaded with freshly created plasma .",
    "then their trajectories bend around so that they join the back of the tongue . in this manner",
    ", plasma is continuously removed from the entire torus even though the tongue emanates from only a limited range of azimuth .    in order for the convection pattern to remain steady ,",
    "plasma must consistently outflow from the same range of azimuth in the rotating frame .",
    "outflow occurs from the densest part of the torus , and so if a single tongue is to carry the outgoing material , its base must always be refilled fast enough so that no other longitudes in the torus can accumulate more plasma . inwardly drifting tubes , which empty the rest of the torus of plasma , drift more slowly than those moving outwards , because the electric fields in the inward - drifing tubes can not be larger than the internal tongue fields which they `` fringe '' .",
    "only if the base of the tongue spans @xmath5 radians can the inwards drift velocity be large enough to keep the plasma content in the rest of the torus lower than in the tongue region .",
    "we have been able to bolster this description with simplified models of electrostatic fields , but much remains to be done before anything rigorous might emerge .",
    "a serious technical issue is that a smooth tongue of plasma is likely to develop narrower fingers as discussed above .",
    "fortunately , the conclusions of our investigation are insensitive to this possibility . however , it would certainly impede a rigorous calculation of the convection pattern . that will have to be left for the future .",

    "[ subsec : past ] , for realistic conditions , this has proven to be a difficult task .",
    "fortunately , a simpler procedure suffices for the purposes of the current investigation .",
    "we set @xmath51 with @xmath52    this procedure does a good job evaluating @xmath39 in the portion of the ionosphere that is magnetically connected to the outgoing tongue of magnetospheric plasma .",

    "then @xmath61 substituting for @xmath62 using equation , we arrive at @xmath63 from which we obtain @xmath64 next we replace @xmath20 in @xmath65 which yields @xmath66      flux freezing implies that @xmath67 is independent of @xmath14 in a sourceless , steady - state flow .",
    "consequently , @xmath60 at @xmath14 is related to its initial value at @xmath68 by @xmath69 thus @xmath70 @xmath71    somewhat arbitrarily , we adopt @xmath72 , the value of @xmath14 where @xmath73 , or equivalently where @xmath74 , as the outer radius of the region in which partial corotation applies ; @xmath75    the timescale @xmath76 for outward plasma transport decreases with distance from the planet .",
    "plasma near the source at @xmath68 doubles its radial distance in a time @xmath77 days .",
    "the constancy of the observed magnetic period on far longer timescales implies that the convection pattern remains steady for many dynamical timescales of the source region .",
    "the azimuthal current @xmath78 creates a radial component of magnetic field just above and below the tongue of outgoing plasma ; @xmath79 applying equations and , we find that these field lines bulge outward relative to vertical by an angle @xmath80 the stretching of these field lines is a consequence of the centripetal acceleration they impart to the plasma .",
    "if @xmath81 attains a substantial value at @xmath72 , the exposure of saturn s polar cap to the incoming solar wind will be enhanced along the range of longitudes subtended by the outer parts of the tongue .",
    ", @xmath82 may be quite small , even if @xmath83 is of order @xmath84 .",
    "] this could account for the preferential emission of the skr within a narrow range of longitudes .",
    "the radial current in the tongue of outgoing material at @xmath14 is given by @xmath85 thus @xmath86 is the current that flows along the strip of field lines connecting the ionosphere ( in each hemisphere ) to the tongue between @xmath14 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is notable that @xmath88 depends on the rate of mass loss but not on the pattern of outflow .    to estimate the magnetic perturbation produced by this current , we approximate it as flowing along a thin wire of infinite extent which passes the observation point at distance @xmath89",
    ". then @xmath90 we focus on perturbations in the equatorial region of the inner magnetosphere , since this is where the _ cassini _ magnetometer has found evidence for non - axisymmetric field components . for an observer in the equatorial plane at radius @xmath91 ,",
    "the minimum distance @xmath89 between the observer and a `` wire '' of dipole field - aligned current which passes through the equator at @xmath92 is @xmath93 . substituting for @xmath89 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ddelbda ] and integrating to @xmath72 , we find @xmath94    the above estimate for the magnitude of the magnetic perturbations ignores the contribution from the return current that comes from @xmath95 and closes the circuit .",
    "unfortunately , not much can be deduced about the geometry of the return current since the field lines it flows along are likely to be strongly perturbed by the solar wind .",
    "however , it is possible that it could act to reduce the perturbation magnitude , perhaps by a factor 2 .",
    "we have also ignored the contribution from the currents that flow in the opposite ( n versus s ) hemisphere . in the case of perfect n - s symmetry , magnetic perturbations from the two hemispheres",
    "would exactly cancel in the middle of the tongue but not elsewhere .",
    "in reality , at most times this cancelation is likely to be small , since the ionospheric conductivity will differ in the northern and southern polar ionospheres .",
    "near solstice , almost all the current will flow through the summer hemisphere . at these times",
    "the estimate for @xmath96 should be doubled .    as illustrated in figure [ fig : tongue ] , the field - aligned ( birkeland )",
    "currents supplying @xmath78 to the tongue occur in closely spaced , oppositely directed pairs .",
    "the magnetic perturbations produced by these `` line dipoles '' are small at distances large compared to their spacing .",
    "thus , although they are typically smaller , the field - aligned currents feeding @xmath97 dominate the magnetic perturbations present in the magnetosphere .",
    "the fragmentation of the plasma tongue into narrower structures would have a minor effect on the magnetic perturbations produced by the currents supplying @xmath98 , but would further weaken those produced by the currents supplying @xmath99 .",
    "analysis of the variation of the measured components of @xmath96 with position in the magnetosphere would test our model .",
    "as described in  [ sec : intro ] , a somewhat slow and imperfect clock controls the quasi - periodic behavior of skr bursts . in our scenario",
    "the same clock controls the magnetic anomalies . both _ voyager_- and _ cassini_-era measurements of skr and magnetic periods are consistent with this picture .",
    "the clock is located in the inner magnetosphere and beats at the period of rotation of the asymmetry associated with the inner portion of the plasma outflow . around the orbit of enceladus",
    "is the dominant plasma source . ]",
    "as explained below , the clock s period propagates throughout the magnetosphere provided the differential rotation of the latter remains time invariant .",
    "suppose that a source of material located at radius @xmath68 feeds a plasma torus rotating at @xmath100 .",
    "the torus is unstable and sends out a `` tongue '' of plasma centered on a fixed azimuth @xmath101 in the rotating frame .",
    "plasma at the center of the tongue moves outwards at radial speed @xmath102 , and orbits at angular speed @xmath103 , where @xmath104 . in steady - state ,",
    "the shape of the tongue s centerline would be determined by @xmath105    viewed from a nonrotating frame , the tongue is a steady structure rotating at pattern speed @xmath100 . at radius @xmath14 and time @xmath106",
    ", the apparent azimuth of the tongue s centerline is given by @xmath107 and so @xmath108 , regardless of the run of differential rotation across the magnetosphere .",
    "skr and magnetic periods determined by cassini are longer than those associated with the motion of any atmospheric features .",
    "the most plausible explanation is that the ionosphere rotates more slowly than the atmosphere below it because magnetic torques are transferring angular momentum from it to the plasma tongue .    since the magnetic torque increases sharply with increasing latitude , this is also a plausible explanation for the observed decline of the magnetosphere s angular velocity with increasing distance from saturn .",
    "we shall show that this scenario is qualitatively reasonable , in contrast to models based on the slippage of the rotation of the magnetospheric plasma relative to the rotation of the ionosphere .",
    "most of the way out , the plasma maintains good corotation with the part of the ionosphere to which it is connected , but the ionosphere is subcorotating with respect to the underlying atmosphere .",
    "the observed clock frequency is the rotation rate of the ionosphere where it connects to the inner part of the plasma tongue .",
    "we analyze a simple model for the steady - state rotation of the ionosphere and underlying atmosphere .",
    "it assumes axial symmetry and considers only vertical transport of angular momentum .",
    "deep atmospheric layers are taken to rotate rigidly with angular velocity @xmath7 .",
    "we work within the approximation of an isothermal atmosphere with sound speed @xmath109 , scale height @xmath110 , buoyancy frequency @xmath111 , and eddy diffusivity @xmath112 .",
    "the ionosphere is taken to be a single layer rotating at the angular velocity @xmath113 of the part of the plasma tongue to which it is magnetically connected .",
    "we modify equation to allow for the nonuniform rotation rate , @xmath113 , of the magnetospheric plasma .",
    "the torque per unit @xmath14 applied to the tongue of outgoing plasma reads @xmath114 thus the magnetic torque per unit @xmath25 on the northern ionosphere is given by @xmath115 in steady state , the torque must be constant with depth below the ionosphere . provided",
    "the torque is not too large , a stable , steady - state , shear flow is established in which the viscous torque given by @xmath116 carries angular momentum up from the atmosphere to the ionosphere .",
    "equating the viscous torque to the magnetic torque yields @xmath117 the shear flow is stable where the richardson criterion is satisfied , that is where equation ( [ eq : dlnomdt ] ) predicts @xmath118 in the stable regime , @xmath119 here we have set @xmath120 in the final step .",
    "this is a good approximation since @xmath121 in the stable regime .",
    "the boundary of the stable regime occurs where the stability criterion is violated just below the ionosphere .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath122 to denote the value of @xmath25 at this boundary . at @xmath122 , @xmath123 an approximate solution for @xmath122 , and the corresponding @xmath124 , follows from setting @xmath120 : in this manner we arrive at @xmath125    the unstable layer penetrates deeper into the atmosphere poleward of @xmath122 . because the angular velocity gradient in the stable layer is inversely proportional to density , and the density increases exponentially with depth , the thickness of the unstable layer increases logarithmically with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "an estimate for @xmath126 is obtained by multiplying the critical angular velocity gradient from equation by the thickness of the unstable layer .",
    "the following expression provides a good fit to @xmath126 for all values of @xmath25 or @xmath127 .",
    "we express it in terms of the latter for ease of comparison with data on the rotation of plasma in saturn s magnetosphere .",

    "by comparison , equation predicts the much smaller value , @xmath132 , for the slippage of the rotation rate in the plasma tongue at @xmath133 relative to that of the ionosphere .",
    "the ionospheric rotation rate responds to changes in a variety of parameters , including the atmosphere s eddy diffusion coefficient , the ionosphere s height - integrated conductivity , and the rate of mass loss from the magnetosphere .",
    "all of these are likely to have a seasonal dependence .",
    "solar weather , including short term variations in the solar wind ram pressure and longer term variations over the solar activity cycle also affect the conductivity in the auroral ionosphere .",
