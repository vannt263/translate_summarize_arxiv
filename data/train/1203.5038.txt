    "single particle tracking dates back to the classic study of perrin on brownian motion ( bm ) @xcite .",
    "it generates the position time series of an individual particle trajectory @xmath0 in a medium ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and when properly interpreted , the information drawn from a single , or a finite number of trajectories , can provide insight into the mechanisms and forces that drive or constrain the motion of the particle .",
    "the method is thus potentially a powerful tool to probe physical and biological processes at the level of a single molecule @xcite . at the present time , single particle tracking is widely used to characterize the microscopic rheological properties of complex media @xcite , and to probe the active motion of biomolecular motors @xcite . in biological cells and complex fluids , single particle trajectory ( spt ) methods have , in particular , become instrumental in demonstrating deviations from normal bm of passively moving particles ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the reliability of the information drawn from spt analysis , obtained at high temporal and spatial resolution but at expense of statistical sample size is not always clear .",
    "time averaged quantities associated with a given trajectory may be subject to large fluctuations among trajectories . for a wide class of anomalous diffusions described by continuous - time",
    "random walks , time - averages of certain particle s observables are , by their very nature , themselves random variables distinct from their ensemble averages @xcite .",
    "an example is the square displacement time - averaged along a given trajectory , which differs from the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement @xcite . by analyzing time - averaged displacements of a particular trajectory realization",
    ", subdiffusive motion can actually look normal , although with strongly differing diffusion coefficients from one trajectory to another @xcite .",
    "standard bm is a much simpler and exceedingly well - studied random process @xcite than anomalous diffusion , but still it is far of being as straightforward as one might be tempted to think . even in bounded systems , despite the fact that the first passage time distribution has all moments , first passages to a given target of two independent identical bms , starting at the same point in space , will most likely occur at two distinctly different time moments @xcite , revealing a substantial manifestation of sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "ergodicity , that is , equivalence of time- and ensemble - averages of square displacement holds only in the infinite sample size limit . in practice , it means that standard fitting procedures applied to finite ( albeit very long ) trajectories of a given particle will unavoidably lead to fluctuating estimates of the diffusion coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , variations by orders of magnitude have been observed in spt measurements of the diffusion coefficient of the laci repressor protein along elongated dna @xcite ( see also section [ z ] ) .",
    "significant sample - to - sample fluctuations resulting in broad histograms for the value of the diffusion coefficient have been observed experimentally for two - dimensional ( 2d ) diffusion in the plasma membrane @xcite , as well as for diffusion of a single protein in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of mammalian cells @xcite .",
    "such a broad dispersion of the value of the diffusion coefficient extracted from spt measurements , raises important questions about the correct or optimal methodology that should be used to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , these measurements are performed in rather complex environments and each spt has its own history of encounters with other species , defects , impurities , etc . , which inevitably results in rather broad histograms for observed @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , it is highly desirable to have a reliable estimator of the diffusion coefficient even for the hypothetical `` pure '' cases , such as , e.g. , unconstrained standard bm .",
    "a reliable estimator should produce a distribution of @xmath1 as narrow as possible and with the most probable value as close as possible to the ensemble average one .",
    "a knowledge of the distribution of such an estimator could provide a useful gauge to identify effects of the medium complexity as opposed to variations in the underlying thermal noise driving microscopic diffusion .",
    "commonly used methods of extraction of @xmath1 from the spt data are based on a least square ( ls ) estimate of the time - averaged square displacement and some of its derivatives ( see , e.g. , @xcite and the next section ) . a recent study , ref .",
    "@xcite , focussed on estimators for @xmath1 for 1d bm , the statistics of which is amenable to analytical analysis .",
    "several methods for estimating @xmath1 from the spt data were studied and it was shown that a completely different approach - consisting of maximizing the unconditional probability of observing the whole trajectory - is superior to those based on the ls minimization . as a matter of fact , at least in 1d systems the distribution of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator of the diffusion coefficient not only appears narrower than the ls ones , resulting in a smaller dispersion , but also the most probable value of the diffusion coefficient appears closer to the ensemble average @xmath1 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus first on the case of pure standard bm and calculate exactly , for arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath2 , the distribution @xmath3 of the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath4 of the diffusion coefficient of a single bm trajectory @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 here is the lag time ( at which the measurement is started ) which can be set equal to zero for standard bm without any lack of generality .",
    "however for anomalous diffusion , or bm in presence of disorder @xmath6 will play a significant role .",
    "the symbol @xmath7 denotes ensemble average , so that @xmath8 @xmath1 being the ensemble - average diffusion coefficient",
    ". consequently , the random variable @xmath9 is defined as the ratio of the realization - dependent diffusion coefficient , calculated as the weighted time - average along a single trajectory , and the ensemble average diffusion coefficient . clearly , @xmath10 .",
    "further on , we analyze here a useful measure of sample - to - sample fluctuations - the distribution function @xmath11 of the random variable @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two identical independent random variables with the distribution @xmath3 . hence , the distribution @xmath11 probes the likelihood of the event that the diffusion coefficients drawn from two different trajectories are equal to each other .    finally , we discuss the effect of disorder on the distributions @xmath3 and @xmath11 for 1d bm in random media .",
    "we consider two different models of diffusion in 1d random environments - diffusion in presence of a random quenched potential with a finite correlation length , as exemplified here by the slutsky - kardar - mirny model @xcite , and diffusion in a random forcing landscape - the so - called sinai model @xcite .",
    "the former is appropriate for diffusion of proteins on dna , which is affected by the base - pair reading interaction and thus is sequence dependent , while the latter describes , for example , the dynamics of the helix - coil boundary in a melting heteropolymer @xcite .",
    "note that in the former case , at sufficiently large times , one observes a diffusive - type motion with @xmath15 , while in the latter case dynamics is strongly _ anomalous _ so that @xmath16 is logarithmically confined , @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : in section [ a ] we recall some common fitting procedures used to calculate the diffusion coefficient from single particle tracking data . in section [ b ] we focus on the maximum likelihood estimator and , generalizing the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for 1d systems , obtain new results for the moment generating function @xmath18 and the probability density function @xmath3 of the ml estimator for arbitrary spatial dimension @xmath2 . in that section",
    "we also obtain the asymptotical behavior of the probability distribution function @xmath3 , as well as its kurtosis and skewness .",
    "next , in section [ c ] we focus on the probability distribution function of the random variable @xmath19 - a novel statistical diagnostics of the broadness of the parental distribution @xmath3 which probes the likelihood of the event that two estimates of the diffusion coefficient drawn from two different trajectories are the same .",
    "further on , section [ d ] presents a comparison of the commonly used least squares estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "we show that the latter outperforms the former in any spatial dimension @xmath2 producing a lower variance and the most probable value being closer to the ensemble average value .",
    "next , in section [ e ] we focus on brownian motion in presence of disorder .",
    "as exemplified by two models of dynamics in systems with quenched disorder - sinai diffusion ( random force ) and slutsky - kardar - mirny model ( random potential ) , disorder substantially enhances the importance of sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "we show that the observation of values of the diffusion coefficient significantly lower than the ensemble average becomes more probable .",
    "we show , as well , that as the strength of disorder is increased , the distribution @xmath11 undergoes a surprising shape - reversal transition from a bell - shaped unimodal to a bimodal form with a local minimum at @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ f ] with a brief recapitulation of our results and some outline of our further research .",
    "to set up the scene , we first briefly recall several fitting procedures commonly used to calculate the diffusion coefficient from the spt data .",
    "more detailed discussion can be found in refs .",
    "we focus here on estimators which yield a first power of @xmath1 .",
    "non - linear estimators , e.g. a mean maximal excursion method @xcite which has been used to study anomalous diffusion and produces @xmath21 , will be analyzed elsewhere .",
    "one of the simplest methods consists in calculating a least squares estimate based on the minimization of the integral @xmath22 where the diffusion law @xmath23 is taken either as a linear , @xmath24 , or an affine function , @xmath25 . in particular , for the linear case the least squares minimization yields the following linear - least - squares estimator : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the normalization factor , @xmath28 , conveniently chosen so that @xmath29 .    a second , more sophisticated",
    ", approach is based on @xmath30 which is the temporal moving average over a sufficiently long trajectory @xmath0 produced by the underlying process of duration @xmath31 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is then extracted from fits of @xmath32 , or from a related least squares estimator , which is given by the following functional of the trajectory @xmath33 where @xmath27 is the same normalization constant as in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "note that the random variable @xmath34 is again conveniently normalized so that @xmath35 , which enables a direct comparison of the respective distributions of different estimators . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath34 only provides a slightly better estimate of @xmath1 than @xmath36 .",
    "a conceptually different fitting procedure has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite which amounts to maximizing the unconditional probability of observing the whole trajectory @xmath0 , assuming that it is drawn from a brownian process with mean - square displacement @xmath37 ( see eq .",
    "( [ msd ] ) ) .",
    "this is the maximum likelihood estimate which takes the value of @xmath1 that maximizes the likelihood of @xmath0 , defined as : @xmath38 where the trajectory @xmath0 is appropriately discretized . differentiating the logarithm of @xmath39 with respect to @xmath1 and setting @xmath40",
    ", one finds the maximum likelihood estimate of @xmath1 , which upon a proper normalization is defined by eq .",

    "thus , @xmath18 factorizes @xmath46 where @xmath47    here , in order to calculate @xmath48 , we follow the strategy of ref .  @xcite and introduce an auxiliary functional : @xmath49 where the expectation is for a bm starting at @xmath50 at time @xmath43 . we derive a feynman - kac type formula for @xmath51 considering how the functional in eq .",

    "for such an evolution we have to order @xmath58 : @xmath59 expanding the right - hand - side of the latter equation to second order in @xmath54 , linear order in @xmath58 and performing averaging , we find eventually the following schrdinger equation : @xmath60 the solution of this equation has been obtained in ref .",

    "<S> modern developments in microscopy and image processing are revolutionizing areas of physics , chemistry and biology as nanoscale objects can be tracked with unprecedented accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of single particle tracking is to determine the interaction between the particle and its environment . </S>",
    "<S> the price paid for having a direct visualization of a single particle is a consequent lack of statistics . </S>",
    "<S> here we address the optimal way of extracting diffusion constants from single trajectories for pure brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the maximum likelihood estimator is much more efficient than the commonly used least squares estimate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we investigate the effect of disorder on the distribution of estimated diffusion constants and show that it increases the probability of observing estimates much smaller than the true ( average ) value . </S>"
