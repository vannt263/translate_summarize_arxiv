    "this projective system is called the rapoport - zink tower .",
    "it can be regarded as a local analogue of a tower of shimura varieties of pel type .    by taking a compactly supported @xmath0-adic cohomology of the tower",

    "it is expected that the alternating sum @xmath9 of @xmath3 can be described by the ( still conjectural ) local langlands correspondence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most classical examples of the rapoport - zink tower are the lubin - tate tower and the drinfeld tower . in these cases , the expectation above is called the non - abelian lubin - tate theory ( @xcite ) and has been already proven ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "there are more precise studies on the individual cohomology @xmath3 ; see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the case where @xmath10 . in this case",
    ", the rapoport - zink space @xmath11 is the moduli space of deformations by quasi - isogenies of a principally polarized 2-dimensional @xmath2-divisible group with slope @xmath12 .",
    "we ignore the action of the weil group @xmath7 and concentrate on the action of @xmath13 on @xmath3 .",
    "our main result can be summarized as follows :    [ thm : main - intro ] for an irreducible smooth representation @xmath14 of @xmath15 , we put @xmath16=\\sum_{i , j\\ge 0}(-1)^{i+j}\\ext^j_{\\mathbf{j}(\\q_p)}(h^i_{\\mathrm{rz}},\\rho)^{\\mathrm{sm}}$ ] , where @xmath17 is taken in the category of smooth @xmath15-representations and @xmath18 denotes the set of @xmath19-smooth vectors .",
    "let @xmath20 be an @xmath1-parameter which is relevant for @xmath15 .",

    "very roughly speaking , this theorem says that the local jacquet - langlands correspondence @xmath34 appears in @xmath35 .    to prove the theorem above",
    ", we will apply the lefschetz trace formula for adic spaces developed in @xcite ; we count fixed points on the rapoport - zink space under the action of elements in @xmath13 to compute the trace on the cohomology @xmath35 .",
    "such a method goes back to a pioneering work of faltings @xcite , in which he treated the drinfeld tower .",
    "a similar study for the lubin - tate tower has been carried out by strauch @xcite .",
    "needless to say , our work is strongly inspired by these two works .",
    "however , our case is more difficult than the classical cases in the following two points .",
    "first , any connected component of our rapoport - zink space @xmath11 is neither quasi - compact nor @xmath2-adic , therefore harder to deal with .",
    "this is related to the fact that neither @xmath19 nor @xmath15 is compact modulo center ( in the classical cases , @xmath19 or @xmath15 is the multiplicative group of a division algebra ) .",
    "the other point is representation - theoretic one ; the local langlands correspondences for @xmath19 and @xmath15 are not bijective . under the `` dictionary '' between irreducible representations and conjugacy classes",
    ", this corresponds to the fact that conjugacy and stable conjugacy are different in @xmath19 and @xmath15 .",
    "this difference makes our argument on counting points and harmonic analysis more subtle .",
    "we sketch the outline of this paper . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce some notation on algebraic groups and stable orbital integrals , which will be used throughout this paper . in section 3 , after recalling basic definitions on the rapoport - zink tower for @xmath36 , we count fixed points on the rapoport - zink space under the action of an element @xmath37 .",
    "our method of counting is similar to @xcite ; we use the period map introduced in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 5 ) and the @xmath2-adic hodge theory for @xmath2-divisible groups . in section 4 ,",
    "we construct formal models of the rapoport - zink spaces with some higher levels ( more precisely , levels which are open normal subgroups of parahoric subgroups of @xmath19 ) .",
    "moreover , we introduce `` boundary strata '' of these formal models and investigate group actions on them .",
    "these constructions are extremely important for applying the lefschetz trace formula such as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.5 ) .",
    "basically , the content of this section ( especially proposition [ prop : formal - model - disjoint ] ) forces us to assume that @xmath38 . in section 5",
    ", we construct a nice open covering of the rapoport - zink space with parahoric level .",
    "the construction is similar to the case of the drinfeld upper half space , which has an open covering indexed by vertices of the bruhat - tits building for @xmath39 . in section 6 , we apply the lefschetz trace formula to a finite union of open subsets belonging to the open covering constructed in section 5 . finally in section 7",
    ", we briefly review the local langlands correspondence for @xmath19 and @xmath15 due to gan - takeda @xcite and gan - tantono @xcite respectively , and give a proof of the main theorem .",
