    "snow crystals grown from a supersaturated vapour lead to a variety of complex and often very symmetric patterns .",
    "crystallisation from vapour is a fundamental phase transition , and a good understanding is crucial for many applications .",
    "numerous experiments have been performed , and compilations of photographs of artificial and natural snowflakes reveal their beauty and complexity , see @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "the precise forms of snow crystals depend in a very subtle way on the temperature and the supersaturation .",
    "@xcite analysed these dependencies in detail and combined his observations in his now famous nakaya _ snow crystal morphology diagram _ , see figure  [ fig : libbrecht ] . at temperatures just below the freezing temperature thick plates",
    "grow at lower supersaturations and plate - like dendritic forms appear at higher supersaturations . at temperatures around @xmath0c",
    "solid prisms grow at lower supersaturations and hollow columns and needle - like crystals at higher supersaturations .",
    "if the temperature is decreased below @xmath1c one observes thin solid plates at low supersaturations , whereas dendrites form at high supersaturations .",
    "below @xmath2c again columns form at high supersaturations .",
    "the results from @xcite , which led to the snow crystal morphology diagram , have been confirmed by many subsequent experimental studies . although the experiments give a rather clear picture , the physics behind the snow crystal morphology diagram are not yet understood .",
    "a continuum mathematical modelling of snow crystal growth leads to a quasi - static diffusion problem for the diffusion of the vapour molecules .",
    "the diffusion equation has to be solved together with rather complex boundary conditions on the free boundary between vapour and solid .",
    "the conditions on this interface are given by the continuity equation relating the flux of vapour molecules onto the interface to the interface velocity , and an equation describing the attachment kinetics taking surface energy effects into account .",
    "in the latter condition the hexagonal anisotropy of snow crystals also enters . due to being highly nonlinear , and since it is geometrically very involved , the complete free boundary problem is difficult to analyse theoretically .",
    "however , there exists a large literature on numerical computations for diffusion limited growth and the formation of dendrites , which we now briefly discuss .",
    "numerical approaches for crystal growth usually employ either sharp interface models , in which the solidification front is tracked explicitly , or phase field models , in which the solidification front is modelled by a thin diffusional layer . in sharp interface",
    "approaches the front is described with the help of a parameterisation , see @xcite , or by using a level set function , see @xcite . in a phase field method a new order parameter the phase field",
    "is introduced , which at the interface rapidly changes its value between two fixed values , which describe the different phases , see @xcite .",
    "a popular discrete model for the simulation of crystal growth are cellular automata , see @xcite .",
    "moreover , molecular dynamics simulations are used to understand the surface structure of ice @xcite .",
    "although many computations have been performed , a quantitative numerical description of facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is missing .    in recent research by the authors",
    "a new parametric approach for interface motion has been developed @xcite .",
    "the method has the feature that the mesh quality of the interface approximation , which is given by a polyhedral surface mesh , remains good during the evolution ",
    "most earlier approaches had to deal with mesh degeneracies , e.g.  by re - meshing the interface approximation .",
    "in addition , the present authors were able to include anisotropy effects into curvature driven hypersurface evolution in a numerically stable way .",
    "this allows the method to compute in situations in which the anisotropy is facetted , see @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to demonstrate that with the numerical method introduced in @xcite it is possible to compute snow crystal growth in a qualitatively and quantitatively satisfactory way .",
    "we will present computations showing a significant number of different types of snow crystals , such as _ solid plates _ , _ solid prisms _",
    ", _ hollow columns _ , _ needles _ , _ dendrites _ , _ capped columns _ and _ scrolls on plates_.    in snow crystal growth models several parameters are not known to a sufficient precision . in particular , the surface energy density as a function of orientation",
    "is not known in detail . in addition , the condensation coefficient , which embodies the attachment kinetics of how water molecules are incorporated into the ice lattice , is not known in detail .",
    "for example , it is not known how the condensation coefficient depends on the crystal orientation , see @xcite and the references therein for details .",
    "our numerical computations seem to suggest that the anisotropy in the surface energy density might have a more important impact on snow crystal growth morphologies than previously expected . of course",
    ", numerical simulations alone can not decide whether this is in fact the case , but a comparison of numerical computations with experiments might help to understand this issue better . in particular , it might be possible to obtain more precise estimates for the size of the condensation coefficient as a function of orientation .",
    "we also present some quantitative results , which first of all show what the relatives sizes of the quantities entering the surface attachment kinetics are .",
    "in addition , we show that the tip velocity for a dendrite growing into a supersaturated vapour depends linearly on the supersaturation .",
    "this linear relationship has been already observed in experiments for growing needles , see @xcite , and our computations might help to relate parameters in the theoretical model to experiments .",
    "we consider a continuum model for snow crystal growth , which consists of an ice crystal growing from water vapour , as discussed in e.g.  @xcite , and non - dimensionalize it .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the water vapour number density in gas .",
    "the diffusion equation in the gas phase , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 2 ) ) , is then @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the domain occupied by the gas phase and @xmath6 is the corresponding diffusion constant .",
    "the mass balance at the gas / solid interface @xmath7 gives rise to @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number density for ice .",
    "in addition , @xmath10 is the unit normal to @xmath7 pointing into @xmath5 and @xmath11 is the velocity of @xmath7 in the direction @xmath12 . in (",
    "* ? ? ? * eq .  ( 3 ) )",
    "the term @xmath13 is neglected since @xmath14 . furthermore , taking surface tension effects and attachment kinetics into account , we require , compare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 23 ) ) , @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the kinetic velocity , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 represents the typical order of the surface tension of ice , @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath20 is the temperature and @xmath21 is the equilibrium number density above a flat ice surface , which is dependent on temperature .",
    "in addition , @xmath22 is the anisotropic mean curvature which incorporates the hexagonal anisotropy of the surface energy density .",
    "moreover , @xmath23 is the condensation coefficient , which is denoted by @xmath24 in @xcite , which depends on the orientation of the crystal via the normal @xmath10",
    ". finally , we complement ( [ eq : nondima ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath25 where @xmath26 describes the water vapour number density far away from the interface . here , for convenience , we choose a domain @xmath27 , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , that is large enough so that boundary effects can be neglected .",
    "moreover , @xmath30 is related to the supersaturation @xmath31 by @xmath32 with @xmath33 denoting the mass of a water molecule .",
    "we recall that the supersaturation @xmath31 appears on the vertical axis in figure  [ fig : libbrecht ] .",
    "it remains to introduce the anisotropic mean curvature @xmath22 . instead of a constant surface energy density ,",
    "we choose @xmath34 to be dependent on the orientation of the interface .",
    "the effect of the underlying crystal structure is encoded into the surface energy by allowing @xmath35 , where as stated above , @xmath10 is the unit normal to the solid boundary @xmath7 pointing into the vapour region @xmath5 .",
    "the total surface energy of an interface @xmath36 is now given by the surface integral @xmath37 it is convenient to extend @xmath34 to be a positively homogeneous function of degree one , i.e.  we define @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and refer to @xmath40 as @xmath34 from now on .",
    "the first variation of the above energy can now be computed as @xmath41 i.e.  @xmath42 ; where @xmath43 is the tangential divergence on @xmath36 and @xmath44 is the gradient of @xmath34 , see e.g.   @xcite , and also @xcite .",
    "we now non - dimensionalize the problem . as a length scale",
    "we choose @xmath45 , which we set to be @xmath46 m for snow crystal growth . as a time scale",
    "we choose @xmath47 in addition , we non - dimensionalize the concentration by introducing @xmath48 then , in terms of the new independent variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we obtain ( on dropping the @xmath51 notation for the new variables for ease of exposition ) the equations @xmath52",

    "since @xmath55 , we simplify the first equation to @xmath56 we will choose @xmath34 and @xmath23 of order one , and hence it will be important to specify the order of magnitude of the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath24 in ( [ eq:2 ] ) . taking the values of @xmath58 and @xmath16 from the table in @xcite into account , we observe that @xmath59 independently of the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , for the time scale @xmath60 , which depends on @xmath61 , and hence on @xmath20 , we obtain a range from 100s at @xmath62  c to 1300s at @xmath63  c. these time scales seem to be realistic when comparing with the experiments reported in @xcite .    for the diffusion constant of water vapour in air we take @xmath64 ,",
    "see @xcite , which is valid at a pressure of @xmath65atm . with the values of @xmath66 and @xmath45 mentioned further above we obtain @xmath67    if not otherwise stated , we will always choose these parameters in all the snow crystal growth computations described in section  [ eq : super ] .",
    "for the boundary condition we set , on recalling ( [ eq : nondimb ] ) and ( [ eq : uc ] ) , @xmath68 with the help of the table in @xcite we compute several exemplary values for the fraction in ( [ eq : ud ] ) for different values of the temperature @xmath20 and the supersaturation @xmath31 ; see table  [ tab : uhat ] .",

    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in effect , we appear to have reduced the two parameter variation of the diagram in figure  [ fig : libbrecht ] to the single parameter @xmath70 in ( [ eq : ud ] ) . however , in our numerical simulations of snow crystal growth we will vary both @xmath70 and the kinetic coefficient @xmath23 .",
    "although in reality not much is known about the possible shapes and dependencies of @xmath23 , it is known that @xmath23 strongly depends on @xmath20 . thus varying @xmath23 in our numerical computations",
    "may be interpreted as simulating different ( yet unknown ) temperature regimes .",
    "for the numerical results in this paper we employ the finite element approximation introduced by the authors in @xcite in order to approximate solutions of ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) , ( [ eq : ud ] ) . in the method a uniform time step @xmath71 is employed and the evolution of the crystal surface is tracked with the help of parametric meshes @xmath72 that are independent from the bulk meshes @xmath73 on which the approximation @xmath74 of @xmath75 is computed .",
    "the scheme uses an adaptive bulk mesh that has a fine mesh size @xmath76 around @xmath72 and a coarse mesh size @xmath77 further away from it . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 are given by two integer numbers @xmath80 , where we assume from now on that @xmath81 .",
    "the initial parametric mesh @xmath82 consists of @xmath83 vertices , and this mesh is locally refined , where elements become too large during the evolution .    in order to successfully model the evolution of anisotropic interface evolution laws the authors introduced a stable discretization in @xcite .",
    "we now discuss how @xmath34 and @xmath23 have to be chosen in order to model situations with a hexagonal anisotropy . in this paper , we choose surface anisotropies of the form @xmath84^\\frac12\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath85 , for @xmath86 , are symmetric and positive definite matrices , and @xmath87 denotes a vector in @xmath88 .",

    "hence one issue in our computations is to understand how different choices of @xmath23 influence the overall evolution .",

    "one clearly observes dendritic growth , which is more enhanced at larger supersaturations .",
    "in addition , the evolution is much faster due to the fact that more water vapour molecules are available .",
    "it is also of interest to compare the size of the terms appearing in ( [ eq:2 ] ) . to this end",
    ", we compare the numerical approximations of the terms @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the observed tip velocity , i.e.  the velocity of the part of the interface furthest away from the origin , @xmath144 is the average of @xmath145 on the interface and @xmath146 is the maximum of @xmath145 . for a computation with @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149",

    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "growth from supersaturated vapour is unstable and while the velocity term in ( [ eq:2 ] ) without the curvature term can dampen the unstable modes , they are still unstable on all wavelengths . whereas , the curvature term will stabilise the small wavelengths and will select a fastest growing wavelength , irrespective of the velocity term .",

    "it was suggested to the authors by prof .",
    "libbrecht that the difference of @xmath23 as a function of @xmath10 might be large with a minimum in the the directions of the facet normals .",
    "we hence took @xmath156 and @xmath157 in figure  [ fig:2dlargebetadiff ] .",
    "one observes that the anisotropy in the condensation coefficient @xmath23 is large enough to lead to a six folded branching structure .",
    "but it is also clearly visible that the anisotropy in @xmath23 does not lead to facetted growth .",
    "next we study how the tip velocity in a growing dendritic crystal depends on the supersaturation .",
    "so far nothing is known theoretically for this dependence in the case of facetted growth , see @xcite , even though for simpler problems , i.e.   in the absence of facetting , a vast literature exists , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : comparison1 ] , the tip velocity after some time becomes basically time - independent .",
    "this is true also for our other computations with different supersaturations .",
    "we observe a linear dependence between the supersaturation and the tip velocity that the evolution eventually settles on . to underline this qualitative behaviour",

    "we can clearly see that the facets of the growing crystal are aligned with the wulff shape of @xmath34 .",
    "we also note that facet breaking occurs both in the prismal and in the basal directions . in this context",

    "it is believed that facet breaking occurs when the concentration becomes too non - uniform on the facets @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : hollowcolumn ] we observe facet breaking for the basal and prismal directions , although the breaking predominantly occurs on the basal facets .",
    "choosing the condensation coefficient even larger in the basal directions leads to figure  [ fig:25 ] .",
    "we observe hollow columns as in the nakaya diagram between @xmath0c and @xmath1c at low , but not too low , supersaturations .",
    "increasing the condensation coefficient in the basal directions even further , i.e.  choosing @xmath188 , leads to the evolution depicted on the left of figure  [ fig:27c004 ] . on the right we also display a computation on a coarser grid . both results in figure  [ fig:27c004 ]",
    "lead to needle growth , which also appears in the nakaya diagram .",
    "we remark that the shape on the right of figure  [ fig:27c004 ] is caused by numerical noise and rounding errors .",
    "however , the same effect , on even the most refined meshes , can be achieved by adding random fluctuations to the model . in real life such fluctuations and changes in physical parameters are experienced by the growing snow crystal , as it moves through the atmosphere towards the earth .    a numerical simulation with supersaturation @xmath189 with @xmath190 is displayed in figure  [ fig : c02f6 ] .",
    "in this case capped columns appear , which can also be observed in nature ; see @xcite .",
    "we end this subsection with computations , where we use a time dependent choice for @xmath70 .",

    "first a plate forms and then , due to the fact that the supersaturation increases , the plate becomes unstable and new plate - like shapes grow at the corners of the plate .    finally , we perform two simulations , where we vary @xmath23 in time . in the first such example , we choose @xmath192 \\ , .",

    "we observe scrolls on plates , a shape that is also called plates with scrolls at ends , which also appear in the magono  lee classification of natural snow crystals @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that an approach introduced by the authors in @xcite provides a powerful computational tool to investigate pattern formation in crystal growth in a qualitative and quantitative way .",
    "the method makes it possible to simulate facetted and dendritic growth simultaneously .",
    "we also observe the instability of crystals leading to facet breaking .",
    "many parameters in models for crystal growth are not known . the presented numerical method in combination with a comparison to experiments",
    "can make it possible to estimate the relative sizes of parameters .",
    "in particular , by varying the condensation coefficient we were able to observe either plate - like growth or columnar growth .",
    "* surface energy effects taking anisotropy into account have been included in the model and , despite their small size , they turned out to totally change the character of the interfacial dynamics . in our computations",
    "anisotropic surface energy is required in the interfacial dynamics to produce facetted dendritic growth . *",
    "the influence of the anisotropy in the condensation coefficient , at least at small supersaturations , is not sufficient for facetted growth .",
    "* for small supersaturations the influence of the velocity term in ( [ eq:2 ] ) is small in comparison with the curvature term . *",
    "the velocity at the tip of growing crystals depends in a linear way on the supersaturation .",
