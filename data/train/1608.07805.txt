    "in this situation , getting more information from the observational photospheric vector magnetic fields and corresponding parameters becomes very important .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the energy distribution of magnetic fields in the photosphere inferred from the observational vector magnetograms in flare producing active regions .",
    "the energy released by solar flares and other explosive events relies on the accumulation of the free magnetic energy ( non - potential magnetic energy ) that is defined as the difference between the total magnetic energy ( @xmath3 ) and potential magnetic energy ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5 this means that the free energy is defined with respect to the energy of the potential field that matches the distribution of the observed field s normal component .",

    "@xcite defined the source field to describe the non - potentiality of magnetic field on the photosphere : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the observed vector magnetic field , @xmath9 denotes the potential field extrapolated from the vertical component of @xmath8 , and @xmath10 is the so - called source field that is the non - potential component of the magnetic field . by means of eq .",

    "the difference between the free energy density @xmath42 and non - potential parameter @xmath43 contributed by horizontal components of magnetic fields is @xmath44 this means that the contribution of the parallel component of the non - potential field relative to the potential one is non - negligible , and the difference @xmath45 between two differently defined magnetic energies will only vanish where the potential components of magnetic field are perpendicular to the non - potential ones .",

( [ eq : shearangle ] ) partly relates to term @xmath48 also .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that the magnetic shear contains the information about the energy density contributed from the horizontal component of potential field .    as one knows that the transverse components of potential magnetic field are not an observed quantity , but have to be inferred by the extrapolation of longitudinal components of observational magnetic field ( cf",

    "based on the considerations above , we neglect the contribution of longitudinal component of magnetic field in the study of magnetic energy in the lower solar atmosphere .",

    "<S> we present the photospheric energy density of magnetic fields in two solar active regions inferred from observational vector magnetograms , and compare it with the possible different defined energy parameters of magnetic fields in the photosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the magnetic fields in active region noaa 6580 - 6619 - 6659 and 11158 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noticed that the quantity @xmath0 is an important energy parameter that reflects the contribution of magnetic shear on the difference between the potential magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) and non - potential one ( @xmath2 ) , and also the contribution to the free magnetic energy near the magnetic neutral lines in the active regions . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the photospheric mean magnetic energy density changes obviously before the powerful solar flares in the active region noaa 11158 , it is consistent with the change of magnetic fields in the lower atmosphere with flares . </S>"
