    "after the discovery of the mssbauer effect with @xmath2-transitions in nuclei @xcite , the possibility of observing recoilless resonant emission and detection of antineutrinos ( mssbauer antineutrinos ) was discussed in several publications @xcite,@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an extensive list ( including a figure of merit ) of possibly suitable nuclear transitions has been provided .",
    "more recently , the question concerning mssbauer neutrinos has been revived for the tritium ( @xmath1h ) - helium ( @xmath1he ) system @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the main idea is to use 18.6 kev electron antineutrinos that are emitted without recoil in the bound - state @xmath0-decay of @xmath1h to @xmath1he and are resonantly absorbed - again without recoil - in the reverse bound - state process in which @xmath1he is transformed to @xmath1h .",
    "recoilless emission and absorption are intended to be achieved by embedding @xmath1h and @xmath1he into metallic lattices .    in the present paper , we want to discuss the basic conditions which have to be fulfilled to enable the observation of the mssbauer effect with antineutrinos in the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system . in particular , we will consider lattice expansion and contraction processes which have been neglected up to now but might considerably reduce the recoilfree fraction .",
    "we will critically review magnetic relaxation phenomena in metallic systems and show that the induced homogeneous line broadening , as mentioned earlier @xcite , can not be avoided , in contradiction to a very optimistic recent suggestion @xcite .",
    "concerning inhomogeneous broadening we will describe the direct influence of the binding energies of the @xmath1h and @xmath1he atoms in the metal matrix on the energy of the antineutrinos - a problem which is discussed here for the first time and which may prevent the observation of mssbauer antineutrinos .",
    "we will describe relativistic effects and their connection to second - order doppler shifts , which again can not be discarded since they also give rise to inhomogeneous line broadening .",
    "both homogeneous and inhomogeneous line broadening effects are estimated to be many orders of magnitude larger than the natural width ( minimal width ) @xmath3 ev as calculated on the basis of the lifetime @xmath4 y of @xmath1h .",
    "the observation of mssbauer neutrinos will be a very difficult experiment and may turn out to be unsuccessful with the techniques and ideas available at present .",
    "the usual continuum - state @xmath0-decay ( c@xmath0 ) where a neutron in a nucleus transforms into a proton is a three - body process where the emitted electron ( e@xmath5 ) and the electron antineutrino ( @xmath6 ) occupy states in the continuum leading to broad energy spectra for the e@xmath5 as well as for the @xmath6 . in the bound - state @xmath0-decay ( b@xmath0 ) , however , the e@xmath5 is directly emitted into a bound - state atomic orbit @xcite .",
    "since this is a two - body process , the emitted @xmath6 has a fixed energy @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath6-energy is determined by the q value , the binding energy @xmath8 of the atomic orbit the electron is emitted into , and by the recoil energy @xmath9 of the atom formed after the decay .",
    "this process occurs , e.g. , in the bound - state tritium decay .",
    "the reverse process is also important : a @xmath6 and an e@xmath5 in an atomic orbit are absorbed by the nucleus and a proton is transformed into a neutron .",
    "also this is a two - body process .",
    "the required energy of the antineutrino is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the recoil energy of the atom after the transformation of a proton into a neutron .",
    "this process occurs , e.g. , in the bound - state ec - decay of @xmath1he when irradiated by electron antineutrinos .",
    "since both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are well defined , b@xmath0 has a resonant character which , however , is partially destroyed by the recoil occurring after emission and absorption of the @xmath6 . the resonance cross section is given by @xcite @xmath14 ( in units of @xmath15 ) where @xmath16 for low - z , hydrogen - like wavefunctions @xmath17 ; _ m _ is the electron mass , and @xmath18 is the resonant spectral density , i.e. , the number of antineutrinos in an energy interval of 1 mev around @xmath19 . for a super - allowed transition ,",
    "@xmath20 s. for the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system , the resonance energy is 18.60 kev , @xmath21 s , and b@xmath22c@xmath23 with 80% and 20% of the b@xmath0 events proceeding via the atomic ground state and excited atomic states , respectively @xcite .",
    "if gases of @xmath1h and @xmath1he are used at room temperature the profiles of the emission and absorption probabilities are doppler broadened and both emission as well as absorption of the electron antineutrinos will occur with recoil .",
    "thus the expected resonance cross - section @xmath24 @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , an observation would require very strong sources of @xmath1h and large target ( @xmath1he ) masses @xcite and thus make such an experiment virtually impossible .",
    "however , making use of the mssbauer effect of antineutrinos , i.e. , using recoilfree resonant antineutrino emission and absorption , would increase the resonance cross - section by many orders of magnitude , typically to @xmath25 @xmath15 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in analogy to usual mssbauer spectroscopy with photons @xcite,@xcite , recoilfree emission and absorption can be realized by embedding the atoms of the source ( in the present example , @xmath1h ) and the target ( @xmath1he ) into solid - state lattices , e.g. , into metallic matrices .",
    "recoilfree processes require that the lattice excitations ( e.g. phonons ) will remain unchanged by the emission and the absorption of the antineutrino .",
    "considering the momentum transfer only , the recoilfree fraction is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the transition energy ( 18.6 kev for the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system ) and @xmath28 is the mean - square atomic displacement .",
    "the recoilfree fraction is biggest at low temperatures .",
    "however , even at very low temperatures , @xmath29 , because of the zero - point motion , which itself is a consequence of the heisenberg uncertainty principle . in the debye approximation and in the limit of very low temperatures t , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the effective debye temperature , @xmath32 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath33 is the recoil energy which would be transmitted to a free atom of mass @xmath34 . for @xmath1h and @xmath1he in a metal matrix ,",
    "e.g. nb , effective debye temperatures up to @xmath35 k have been estimated @xcite,@xcite .",
    "thus @xmath36 and the probability for recoilfree emission and consecutive recoilfree capture of electron antineutrinos is given by @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) .",
    "concerning the recoilfree fraction , the anology with usual ( photon ) mssbauer spectroscopy is insufficient : for electron antineutrinos one has to consider an additional process , which is not important for photon mssbauer spectroscopy with excited nuclear states . in this latter case ,",
    "a radioactive parent nucleus decays and populates a nuclear level ( the mssbauer state ) of the daughter nucleus .",
    "deexcitation from this mssbauer state to the groundstate can then proceed via the recoilfree emission of a mssbauer photon . due to the relatively long lifetime of the mssbauer state , most rearrangement processes of the electron shell caused by the preceeding nuclear decay and occurring on a timescale of @xmath39 s ( much shorter than the lifetime of the mssbauer state )",
    "have settled .",
    "thus , the emitted mssbauer photon from the source is not directly involved in the nuclear decay and , therefore , is likely to exhibit the right energy that is required to excite the same mssbauer level in the absorber ( target ) .",
    "the situation is different for antineutrino emission and capture .",
    "these processes occur at the same time when the nuclear transformation to the different element takes place ; in fact the antineutrinos take part in the _ nuclear _ transformation processes .",
    "considering the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system as the particular example , @xmath1h is more strongly bound in the metallic lattice than @xmath1he , and @xmath1h and @xmath1he use different amounts of space . as a consequence ,",
    "the lattice - deformation energies for @xmath1h and @xmath1he , e.g. in the nb lattice , are @xmath40 ev and @xmath41 ev , respectively @xcite .",
    "assuming again an effective debye temperature of @xmath35 k one can estimate - in analogy to the situation with momentum transfer - that the probability that this lattice deformation will _ not _ cause lattice excitations is smaller than @xmath42 .",
    "this factor appears in the emission as well as in the capture process of the antineutrinos .",
    "thus , in addition to the factor @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) , which reflects the momentum transfer in the emission and capture processes of the @xmath6 , lattice deformation results in a further reduction factor of at least @xmath43 .    therefore the total probability for recoilfree emission and consecutive recoilfree capture of @xmath6 is smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "this estimate has to be confirmed by more detailed theoretical calculations ; however , it emphasizes the importance of a thorough understanding of @xmath6 recoilfree emission and capture .      for the @xmath1h decay with a lifetime @xmath4 y , the natural linewidth @xmath45 , i.e. , the minimal width , @xmath3 ev .",
    "in two recent contributions @xcite it has been argued that such a narrow line can indeed be achieved experimentally .",
    "we strongly disagree with these claims and want to stress that basically two types of line broadening are important @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "homogeneous broadening is caused by electromagnetic relaxation .",
    "for example , spin - spin interactions between nuclear spins of @xmath1h and @xmath1he and with the spins of the nuclei of the metallic lattice lead to fluctuating magnetic fields .",
    "contrary to the notion in @xcite , magnetic relaxations are stochastic processes and can not be described by a periodic energy modulation of an excited hyperfine state .",
    "the simplest magnetic relaxation model consists of a three - level system : the groundstate and two excited hyperfine - split states ( energy separation @xmath46 ) between which transitions ( so - called relaxation processes ) take place with an average frequency @xmath47 . with stochastic processes ,",
    "three frequency regimes can be distinguished @xcite :    \\a ) @xmath48 . for the simple three - level system , two lines separated by @xmath46 will be observed .",
    "the lines will be broadened to an effective experimental linewidth @xmath49 as suggested by the time - energy uncertainty principle . only in the limit of very small @xmath47 values , the lines",
    "exhibit natural width . with increasing @xmath47 the lines",
    "broaden .",
    "\\b ) @xmath50 .",
    "the lines are severely broadened .",
    "in fact , the intensity is distributed over a broad pattern which extends roughly over a range given by the total hyperfine splitting @xmath46 , as suggested by the time - energy uncertainty principle .",
    "\\c ) @xmath51 .",
    "this is the frequency regime of motional narrowing .",
    "the system stays only for a short time ( typically @xmath52 ) in one of the levels and then stochastically jumps into the other one .",
    "thus an averaging process over the energies of both levels takes place , resulting in one line at the center of the hyperfine - splitting pattern . in this high - frequency limit",
    "the linewidth is practically natural .    for typical hyperfine splittings due to nuclear spin - spin interaction in metallic lattices , @xmath53 s@xmath54 .",
    "typical relaxation times for @xmath1h and @xmath1he in a pd lattice are @xmath55 ms , and for nbh ,",
    "@xmath56 @xmath57s @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the latter gives a linewidth @xmath58 due to homogeneous broadening , @xmath59 ev @xmath60 .",
    "due to stochastic relaxation processes , homogeneous broadening by @xmath61 orders of magnitude has to be expected in the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system because the stochastic relaxation frequences are far below the motional - narrowing regime . as a consequence ,",
    "also the resonance cross - section @xmath62 will be reduced by @xmath61 orders of magnitude . to compensate for",
    "this effect one would have to increase the number of @xmath1he atoms in the target by the same factor !      in imperfect lattices , inhomogeneous",
    "broadening is caused by stationary effects , in particular by impurities , lattice defects , variations in the lattice constant , and other effects which destroy the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "this is a critical issue also for @xmath6 since - as will be described in section 4 - the source contains a large amount of @xmath1h but very little @xmath1he whereas the target contains a lot of @xmath1he but practically no @xmath1h @xcite,@xcite .",
    "clearly , the @xmath1h and @xmath1he distributions on the interstitial sites will be random and will destroy lattice periodicity .",
    "an additional process due to variations of the zero - point energy will be discussed in section 3.3 . in general , for photon mssbauer spectroscopy , in the best single crystals , inhomogeneous broadening is of the order of @xmath63 ev to @xmath64 ev @xcite .    a feature which is different between usual mssbauer spectroscopy with photons and mssbauer antineutrinos",
    "is connected to the variation of the binding energies of @xmath1h and @xmath1he in an inhomogeneous metallic lattice .",
    "the binding energies directly affect the energy of the @xmath6 : in a perfect lattice , the difference in binding energies in the lattice between @xmath1he and @xmath1h @xcite , which is given to the @xmath6 when @xmath1h decays into @xmath1he , exactly compensates the binding - energy difference needed for the reverse process , when the @xmath6 is captured and @xmath1he transforms into @xmath1h .",
    "however , in the source and target intended to be used in a real experiment ( see section 4 ) such a compensation even within an experimental linewidth of @xmath59 ev will be extremely unlikely considering the fact that the binding energies per atom are in the ev range @xcite .",
    "inhomogeneities in real lattices as mentioned above and , in particular , the vastly different amounts of @xmath1h and @xmath1he in the source and in the target , will result in variations of the binding energies of the @xmath1h and @xmath1he atoms in source and target much larger than @xmath58 and thus destroy the resonance condition .    in usual mssbauer spectroscopy with photons , different binding strengths due to inhomogeneities in source and absorber ( target )",
    "affect the photon energy only via the _ change _ in the mean - square nuclear charge radius between the groundstate and the excited state of the nucleus .",
    "this leads to the _ isomer shift _",
    ", i.e. , a shift of the photon energy in the range typical for _ hyperfine interactions _ ( in the @xmath65 ev range ) @xcite",
    ". thus variations of isomer shifts due to an inhomogeneous lattice lead to a line broadening which is also in the nev range . for @xmath6 of the @xmath1h - @xmath1he system",
    ", a nev shift would already correspond to @xmath66 .",
    "however , since the @xmath6 energy is _ directly _ affected , one has to expect a variation of the @xmath6 energy several orders of magnitude larger than the nev range , i.e. , much larger than @xmath67 .",
    "an atom vibrating around its equilibrium position in a lattice does not only exhibit a mean - square displacement @xmath28 but also a mean - square velocity @xmath68 . according to special relativity theory",
    "this causes a time - dilatation effect which results in a reduction of frequency ( energy ) : @xmath69 .",
    "since this reduction is proportional to @xmath70 it is often called second - order doppler shift ( sod ) .    within the debye model , the energy shift between source ( s ) at temperature @xmath71 and target ( t ) at temperature @xmath72",
    "is given by    @xmath73 $ ]    where @xmath74 .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the temperature - dependent term can be neglected if source and target are at about the same temperature ( e.g. , in a liquid - he bath at 4.2 k ) @xcite . however , even in the low - temperature limit , the first term which is caused by the zero - point energy can not be neglected . as discussed in detail in @xcite",
    ", it is _ not _ required that the chemical bonds ( i.e. the debye temperatures ) of @xmath1h and @xmath1he have to be the same in the metal matrix .",
    "however , the chemical bond for @xmath1h has to be the same in source and target , and the same condition has to be fulfilled for @xmath1he . as a consequence , the surroundings of @xmath1h ( and those for @xmath1he ) including nearest and higher - order nearest neighbors in source and target should be as similar as possible .",
    "this is critical , since , as already mentioned in section 3.2 , source and target contain vastly different amounts of @xmath1h and @xmath1he @xcite,@xcite .",
    "another critical issue is a possible variation of the effective debye temperature due to inhomogeneities within the lattice of the source ( or the target ) itself .",
    "if the effective debye temperature varies by 1 k , the relative change due to a variation of the zero - point energy would be @xmath75 which corresponds to a lineshift of @xmath76 times the natural width @xmath45 . even after taking homogeneous broadening into account , i.e. , considering the above - mentioned linewidth @xmath59 ev , the variation of the zero - point energy would still be @xmath77 .",
    "thus , also the variation of the zero - point energy within the source and the target will significantly contribute to inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "as discussed in detail in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , the most promising system for the observation of mssbauer antineutrinos is @xmath1h as source and @xmath1he as target .",
    "the key idea is to use nb as metal matrix @xcite .",
    "the source can be produced by chemically loading @xmath1h into metallic nb , where @xmath1h occupies the tetrahedral interstitial sites .",
    "the @xmath1he target can be prepared by using the tritium trick : first load @xmath1h into the nb matrix , wait until enough @xmath1h has decayed into @xmath1he , and then remove all the remaining @xmath1h from the nb matrix .",
    "after this procedure , also the @xmath1he should occupy the tetrahedral interstitial sites .",
    "for a base line of @xmath78 m , typical source strengths of 1 mci of @xmath1h and absorber masses of @xmath79 g of @xmath1he have been considered resulting in a typical @xmath0-activity of @xmath80 counts per day after an activation time of 65 days @xcite .      the most difficult experimental problems to observe recoilfree resonant emission and absorption of @xmath6 are the following :    1 .",
    "_ how large is the recoilfree fraction ?",
    "_ the recoilfree fraction due to the momentum transfer of the @xmath6 is reasonable : @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , the critical issue is the lattice expansion and contraction of the metallic lattice due to the different elements before and after the decay ( see section 3.1.2 ) : an additional reduction factor of at least six orders of magnitude has been estimated .",
    "this problem has been overlooked until now , because it does not play a role in the mssbauer effect with photons .",
    "_ how small an experimental linewidth can be achieved ? _ in contrast to the claims presented in @xcite , the natural linewidth @xmath81 ev will not be observed , mainly because of two reasons : a ) _ homogeneous line broadening _ will be caused by _ stochastic _ magnetic relaxation .",
    "the effect of other processes connected with lattice vibrations are unimportant .",
    "homogeneous broadening is estimated to cause an experimental linewidth @xmath59 ev @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "b ) _ inhomogeneous broadening _ can not be avoided in such imperfect lattice systems as @xmath1h in nb and @xmath1he in nb : the random distributions of @xmath1h and @xmath1he in source and target destroy the lattice periodicity , and different contents of these elements will cause further problems . thus , in addition to second - order doppler shifts ( see section 3.3 ) of the resonance lines due to ( small ) changes in the zero - point energy , much larger shifts are expected because of the variation of binding energies ( strengths ) of @xmath1h and @xmath1he in the imperfect nb metal matrix ( see section 3.2.2 ) . these different binding energies _ directly _ influence the energy of the @xmath6 .",
    "also this shift has been overlooked until now , because it is only a tiny ( hyperfine interaction ) effect leading to the isomer shift in mssbauer spectroscopy with photons . with mssbauer antineutrinos ,",
    "this _ direct _ influence on the @xmath6 energy will cause a broadening much larger than @xmath67 ( and thus @xmath62 will be reduced by the same factor , see section 3.2 ) and can turn out to be the main killer of such an experiment .",
    "_ can @xmath1h be removed from the nb metal matrix to low enough concentrations ? _",
    "the tritium trick is a very clever method to make sure that both @xmath1h and @xmath1he occupy the tetrahedral interstitial sites in the nb metal matrix @xcite .",
    "however , any @xmath1h remaining in the target will act as unwanted background .",
    "the application of low temperatures ( liquid he ) _ will be necessary to achieve temperature stability and to make sure that source and target are at the same temperature . otherwise second - order doppler shifts due to different temperatures will be present .",
    "another requirement is an efficient and homogeneous ( across the source matrix ) dissipation of the heat generated by non - resonant c@xmath0 decay events in the source .",
    "if mssbauer antineutrinos could be observed successfully , several interesting experiments could be performed .",
    "here is a short selection :    1 .",
    "a mssbauer antineutrino experiment could provide a unique possibility for a better understanding of the true nature of neutrino oscillations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "because of the extremely sharp energy distribution , oscillations of mssbauer antineutrinos would indicate a stationary phenomenon where the evolution of the neutrino state occurs in space rather than in time .",
    "2 .   due to the low @xmath6 energy of 18.6 kev",
    ", mssbauer - antineutrino oscillations would allow us to use ultra - short base lines to determine oscillation parameters and the mass hierarchy .",
    "for example , for the determination of the mixing angle @xmath82 , a base line of only @xmath80 m ( instead of 1500 m ) would be sufficient .",
    "in addition , very small uncertainties for @xmath82 , accurate measurements of @xmath83 and @xmath84 @xcite , and a determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy @xcite could be achieved .",
    "3 .   in a disappearance experiment with 18.6 kev",
    "mssbauer @xmath6 a search for the conversion @xmath6 @xmath85 @xcite could be performed .",
    "if @xmath86 ev , the oscillation length would only be @xmath87 cm .",
    "this would require ultra - short base lines , which would be difficult to realize otherwise .",
    "4 .   gravitational redshift @xmath6 measurements within a distance of @xmath88 m in the gravitational field of the earth could be carried out .",
    "in contrast to photons , @xmath6 are particles with a ( small ) rest mass and , in principle , could behave differently from photons in a gravitational field . for the determination of the redshift an accuracy of @xmath89 could be reached .",
    "the system @xmath1h ( source ) and @xmath1he ( target ) has been considered for a possible observation of recoilfree resonant ( mssbauer ) emission and absorption of electron antineutrinos .",
    "mssbauer antineutrinos would allow us to perfom interesting new measurements .",
    "however , the experiment is very challenging as emphasized in sections 3 and 4 . in particular",
    ", we have argued that - contrary to the claims of ref .",
    "@xcite - the natural linewidth ( @xmath81 ev ) will not be observed because homogeneous broadening alone would result in an experimental linewidth of @xmath59 ev @xmath60 . even if an experimental linewidth of @xmath59 ev could be reached ( which would still be highly fascinating for many @xmath6 experiments ) , the chances for the observation of mssbauer antineutrinos are drastically reduced because of two newly discussed effects .",
    "they have been overlooked up to now because they play no significant role with photon mssbauer spectroscopy : a ) an additional suppression of the recoilfree fraction because of _ lattice expansion and contraction at the time of the nuclear transition _ , and b ) the _ direct influence of the binding energies _ of @xmath1h and @xmath1he atoms in the metal matrix on the energy of the electron antineutrino .",
    "the variation of these binding energies in the inhomogeneous metal matrix can lead to lineshifts and thus to line broadenings much larger than @xmath67 .",
    "theoretical lattice - dynamics calculations are required to better understand and estimate the importance of both effects .",
    "still , it is obvious already now that both effects might prevent the observation of mssbauer antineutrinos .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank f. wagner and s. roth , physik - department e15 , technische universitt mnchen , for numerous and very fruitful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by funds of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft dfg ( transregio 27 : neutrinos and beyond ) , the munich cluster of excellence ( origin and structure of the universe ) , and the maier - leibnitz - laboratorium ( garching ) .",
