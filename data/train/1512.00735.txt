    "recent experimental investigations of the level structure of the neutron - unbound nucleus @xmath0be agree about the overall strength distribution of the excitation energy spectrum @xcite , but there is no consensus on its interpretation . while there seems to be general agreement about the presence of a broad @xmath2-wave resonance below 1 mev and a @xmath5-wave resonance at 2 mev , the composition of the observed peak around 500 kev , as well as the decay paths of the @xmath5-wave resonance , are still being discussed .",
    "earlier reports of a narrow low - lying @xmath2-wave state @xcite have been attributed to a sequential decay from the first excited 2@xmath7 state in @xmath6be to @xmath1be @xcite .    in 2010 , kondo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a low - lying @xmath8-wave resonance at 510(10 )  kev populated by a one - neutron removal reaction from @xmath6be at 69 mev / u .",
    "however , a recent analysis of these data , as well as a new measurement at a higher beam energy on a hydrogen target ( 304 mev / u ) , preferred an interpretation which fits the @xmath9500 kev peak with only two interfering broad @xmath2-wave resonances @xcite . moreover , the presence of additional @xmath8- or @xmath5-wave strength could not be ruled out , indicating that an @xmath10 resonance around 1 mev might exist @xcite .",
    "the fits in both papers included a significant decay branch of the @xmath11 state to the first excited 2@xmath7 state in @xmath1be .",
    "while neutron - removal reactions are expected to populate positive as well as negative - parity states , proton - removal reactions should be more selective and populate only positive - parity states .",
    "@xcite measured the decay energy spectrum of @xmath0be following the one - proton removal reaction from @xmath6b at 35 mev / u and argued that the @xmath9500 kev peak consists of an @xmath2-wave resonance as well as a low - lying @xmath5-wave resonance .",
    "in addition , randisi _ et al . _ searched for the decay of the @xmath11 resonance at 2 mev to the first excited 2@xmath7 state in @xmath1be by measuring the @xmath12-rays from this state in coincidence .",
    "no significant branch of this decay mode was observed .    in the present work ,",
    "the nucleon - exchange reaction ( @xmath131p+1n ) from @xmath0b was used to populate states in @xmath0be .",
    "similar to the proton - removal reaction it is expected to only populate positive - parity states .",
    "this type of reaction has been shown to have sizable cross sections at intermediate beam energies .",
    "for example , the one - proton removal  one - neutron addition ( @xmath131p+1n ) reaction has been utilized with stable ( @xmath14ca ) as well as radioactive ( @xmath14k and @xmath15cl ) beams to explore the structures of @xmath14k , @xmath14ar , and @xmath15s @xcite .",
    "the inclusive cross sections were 0.13(1 )  mb and 0.057(6 )  mb for the @xmath16be(@xmath14k,@xmath14ar ) and @xmath16be(@xmath15cl,@xmath15s ) , respectively .",
    "this ( @xmath131p+1n ) reaction was also used for the first time to measure neutron unbound states in the study of @xmath17f populated from a 86 mev / u @xmath17ne beam @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university .",
    "a 120 mev / u @xmath18o primary beam from the coupled cyclotron facility bombarded a 2.5  g/@xmath19 @xmath16be production target .",
    "the a1900 fragment separator was used to separate and select the @xmath0b secondary beam .",
    "the final energy of the beam was 71 mev / u , with an intensity of approximately 8@xmath2010@xmath21 particles per second and a purity of 96% .",
    "the @xmath0b beam impinged upon a 51  mg/@xmath19 @xmath16be target where @xmath0be was produced in a nucleon - exchange reaction and immediately decayed into @xmath1be + n.    the @xmath1be reaction products were deflected by a large - gap sweeper magnet @xcite and identified from energy - loss and time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the @xmath1be energy and momentum vectors were reconstructed from position information and a transformation matrix based on the magnetic - field map using the program cosy infinity  @xcite .",
    "coincident neutrons were measured with the modular neutron array ( mona )  @xcite and the large - area multi - institutional scintillator array ( lisa ) .",
    "the energy and momentum vectors of the neutrons were determined from the positions of the neutron interactions in the arrays and the time - of - flight between the arrays and a scintillator located upstream near the target .",
    "the nucleon - exchange data were recorded simultaneously with the data for the one proton - removal reaction populating unbound states in @xmath1be .",
    "these results have been published recently in ref .",
    "@xcite where further details of the experimental setup and analysis can be found .",
    "the decay energy spectrum of @xmath0be was reconstructed by the invariant - mass method and is shown in figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] .",
    "the spectrum shows the same general features as the previous measurements with a strong peak around 500 kev and an additional structure at about 2 mev .",

    "the insert shows the energy dependent resolution ( dotted purple line ) and the overall efficiency ( solid green line).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in order to interpret the measured decay - energy spectrum , monte carlo simulations were performed with the incoming beam characteristics , reaction mechanism , and detector resolutions taken into account .",
    "the neutron interactions within mona - lisa were simulated with geant4  @xcite using the menate_r package @xcite as described in ref .",
    "resonances were parameterized using energy - dependent breit - wigner line shapes @xcite .",
    "the present nucleon - exchange reaction is expected to populate the same positive - parity states that were populated in the one - proton removal reaction . in that case , the valence neutron configuration of the @xmath6b projectile is dominated by @xmath22 and @xmath23 components and states with the same configurations are expected to be populated in @xmath0be by proton removal @xcite .",
    "the ground state of @xmath0b has spin and parity of 3/2@xmath24 dominated by a ( @xmath25)@xmath26 proton configuration and a closed @xmath27 shell neutron configuration .",
    "removing the odd proton from @xmath0b is similar to the proton removal from @xmath6b while the added extra odd neutron will populate states in the open @xmath28 shell .",
    "randisi _ et al .",
    "_ was able to fit their data from the proton - removal reaction based on selectivity arguments with only two components , an @xmath2-wave resonance at @xmath3 = 0.70(11 )  mev with a width of @xmath4 = 1.70(22 )  mev and a @xmath5-wave resonance at @xmath3 = 2.40(14 )  mev with a width of @xmath4 = 0.70(32 )  mev @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the decay - energy spectrum from the present nucleon - exchange reactions is shown in figure [ figure1 ] with an @xmath2-wave resonance at @xmath3 = 0.73(9 )  mev with a width of @xmath4 = 1.98(34 )  mev and a @xmath5-wave resonance at @xmath3 = 2.56(13 )  mev with a width of @xmath4 = 2.29(73 )  mev .",
    "overall these parameters agree with the results from randisi _ et al . _ with only the width of the @xmath5-wave resonance being somewhat larger .",
    "the overall cross section for populating @xmath0be with the ( @xmath131p+1n ) reaction was extracted to be 0.30(15 )  mb which is about an order of magnitude smaller than one - proton removal reactions on neutron - rich @xmath8-shell nuclei .",

    "the resonance energies and widths for this analysis are listed in table [ table1 ] together with the parameters used to fit the present data as shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "a completely unconstrained three - resonance fit resulted in degenerate values for the lower two resonances .",
    "thus the values for the @xmath2-wave resonance was constrained to the value of randisi _ et al . _",
    "( @xmath3 = 0.40 mev , @xmath4 = 0.80 mev ) and the parameters for the second @xmath5-wave resonance were kept at the value extracted from the two - parameter fit ( @xmath3 = 2.56 mev , @xmath4 = 2.29 mev ) .",
    "the resonance energy and width of the first @xmath5-wave resonance as well as strength of all three components were varied .",
    "figure [ figure2 ] shows that the nucleon - exchange data can be well described with parameters similar to the one - proton removal reaction .",

    "the relative intensities in the proton - removal reaction are governed by the ground state configuration of @xmath6b where the spectroscopic factors for populating the 1/2@xmath7 , 5/2@xmath33 , and 5/2@xmath34 were calculated within the wbp shell model to be 0.41 , 0.13 , and 0.43 , respectively , in good agreement with the data @xcite .",
    "the 1/2@xmath7 and 5/2@xmath34 states are dominated by single - particle configurations , whereas the 5/2@xmath33 has 2@xmath35 @xmath36be @xmath37 parentage .",
    "the intensity of the low - lying @xmath5-wave resonance in the nucleon - exchange reaction is slightly larger than the intensity extracted from the proton - removal reaction , while the intensity of the second @xmath5-wave resonance is significantly larger .",
    "these ratios do not have to be the same for the two different reactions .",
    "for example , in addition to the two 5/2@xmath7 states , the ( 0  3)@xmath32 shell model calculations also predict a low - lying 3/2@xmath7 state .",
    "the spectroscopic factor of this state for proton removal from @xmath6b is zero , so it is not expected to be observed in the data of randisi _ et al .",
    "it could , however , be populated in the present reaction which would reduce the strengths of the two @xmath5-wave resonances relative to the low - lying @xmath2-wave resonance .",
    "it should be mentioned that the low - lying 3/2@xmath7 and 5/2@xmath7 states predicted by the ( 0  3)@xmath35 shell - model calculations using the wbp interaction @xcite are not present in the simplified scheme by fortune @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy has recently been reiterated and is not fully understood @xcite .",
    "finally , the present data show no evidence for any low - energy decay from the second @xmath11 to the first excited 2@xmath7 state in @xmath1be as was suggested by aksyutina _",
    "simulations including such a decay branch resulted in an upper limit of less than 10% .",
    "this finding is consistent with results by randisi _",
    "et al . _ who extracted a branching ratio of 5(2)% @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , the @xmath0b(@xmath131p+1n ) nucleon - exchange reaction was used to populate the neutron - unbound nucleus @xmath0be .",
    "the decay - energy spectrum can be described with resonance parameters similar to previously reported values for the proton - removal reaction from @xmath6b . in general nucleon - exchange reactions",
