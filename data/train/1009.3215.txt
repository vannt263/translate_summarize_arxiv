    "the large amount of experimental data collected at rhic during the last decade over a wide kinematical range allows to explore novel qcd effects .",
    "indeed rhic measurements present a number of features which are well described within the color glass condensate effective theory of qcd at high energies ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main physical ingredient in the cgc is the inclusion of unitarity effects through the proper consideration of both non - linear recombination effects in the quantum evolution of hadronic wave functions and multiple scatterings at the level of particle production .",
    "such effects are expected to be relevant when partons with a small enough energy fraction @xmath0 are probed in the nuclear ( or , in full generality , hadronic ) wave function .",
    "the cgc formalism itself is only reliable at small @xmath0 , in that kinematic regime gluon densities are large and gluon self - interactions become highly probable , thus taming , or saturating , further growth of the gluon occupation numbers .",
    "while the need for unitarity effects comprised in the cgc is , at a theoretical level , clear , the real challenge from a phenomenological point of view is to assess to what extent they are present in available data .",
    "such is a difficult task , since different physical mechanisms concur in data , and also because the limit of asymptotically high energy in which the cgc formalism is developed may not be realized in current experiments .    notwithstanding these difficulties",
    ", we argue below that rhic data @xcite offer compelling evidence for the presence of saturation effects .",
    "such claim is based on the successful simultaneous description of the suppression of particle production @xcite and azimuthal correlations @xcite at forward rapidities in d+au collisions compared to p+p collisions , using the most up - to - date theoretical tools available in the cgc approach .",
    "we focus on forward particle production for the following reason : such processes are sensitive only to high - momentum partons inside one of the colliding hadron , which appears dilute , while mainly small - momentum partons inside the other dense hadron contribute to the scattering .",
    "since the high@xmath1 part of a proton wave function is well understood in perturbative qcd , forward particle production in high - energy d+au ( or generically p+a ) collisions is ideal to investigate the small@xmath1 part of the nucleus wave function .    in the case of single - inclusive hadron production @xmath2 , denoting @xmath3 and @xmath4 the transverse momentum and rapidity of the final state particles , the partons that can contribute to the cross section have a fraction of longitudinal momentum bounded from below , by @xmath5 ( for partons from the proton wave function ) and @xmath6 ( for partons from the nucleus wave function ) given by @xmath7 where we introduced the feynman variable @xmath8 with @xmath9 the collision energy per nucleon . with @xmath10 and",
    "forward rapidities @xmath11 the process features @xmath12 and @xmath13 meaning that the scattering involves on the proton side , quantum fluctuations well understood in qcd , and on the nucleus side , quantum fluctuations whose non - linear qcd dynamics can be studied .    in the case of double - inclusive hadron production @xmath14 , denoting @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 the transverse momenta and rapidities of the final - state particles , the feynman variables are @xmath19 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 read @xmath20 therefore , only the forward - forward case is sensitive to values of @xmath0 as small as in the single particle production case : @xmath12 and @xmath21 .",
    "the central - forward measurement does not probe such kinematics : moving one particle forward increases significantly the value of @xmath5 compared to the central - central case ( for which @xmath22 ) , but decreases @xmath6 only marginally .",
    "for this reason we shall refer to these two situations as mid - rapidity ones .",
    "the approximations made in cgc calculations apply best with forward - rapidity observables , at rhic mid - rapidity ones are contaminated too much by large-@xmath0 physics to be treated at a quantitative level .",
    "saturation - based approaches were the only ones to correctly predict the suppression of forward particle production @xcite and the azimuthal decorrelation of forward hadron pairs @xcite . in the following",
    ", we also comment on alternative mechanisms that successfully describe mid - rapidity particle production in d+au collisions .",
    "we note that , while some of these approaches are also able to describe , a posteriori , the suppression of forward yields , we are not aware of any formalism that can also describe the azimuthal decorrelation of forward hadron pairs .",
    "in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , nuclear effects on single particle production are typically evaluated in terms of ratios of particle yields called nuclear modification factors : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in the p+a collision . if high - energy nuclear reactions were a mere incoherent superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions , then the observed @xmath25 would be equal to unity . however , rhic measurements in d+au collisions ( or peripheral au+au collisions ) @xcite exhibit two opposite regimes : at mid rapidities the nuclear modification factors exhibit an enhancement in particle production at intermediate momenta @xmath26 gev . in turn , a suppression at smaller momenta is observed .",
    "however , at forward rapidities the cronin enhancement disappears , turning into an almost homogeneous suppression .     at @xmath27 compared with different calculations . from left to right : comparison with eps09 parametrization @xcite , a glauber - eikonal calculation @xcite , and the cgc approach of @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=147 ]   at @xmath27 compared with different calculations . from left to right : comparison with eps09 parametrization @xcite , a glauber - eikonal calculation @xcite , and the cgc approach of @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=143 ]   at @xmath27 compared with different calculations . from left to right : comparison with eps09 parametrization @xcite , a glauber - eikonal calculation @xcite , and the cgc approach of @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    single - hadron production data at mid - rapidity have been successfully analyzed through different formalisms and techniques .",
    "below we sketch an incomplete , but representative list of the variety in the theory spectrum :    * * leading - twist perturbation theory*. the assumption is that standard collinear factorization holds in nuclear reactions , meaning that highly - virtual partons in nuclei behave independently as they do in protons . for each parton",
    "species @xmath28 the nuclear parton distribution functions are taken to be proportional to that of a proton : @xmath29 .",
    "the proportionality factors @xmath30 are fitted , in part , to available d+au data and in some cases , as in the eps parametrization @xcite , evolved according to dglap evolution .",
    "the resulting data description is displayed in a. * * glauber - eikonal multiple scatterings*. this approach takes into account power corrections to the leading - twist approximation .",
    "it relies on a resummation of incoherent multiple scatterings .",
    "typically , this results in a momentum broadening of the scattered parton which is responsible for the cronin enhancement and , due to unitarity constraints , to a depletion of particle production at small transverse momenta , in agreement with the qualitative features of the data as can be seen in b. performing the complete resummation including energy - momentum conservation is a challenging task . sometimes , a detour of the strict calculation is taken by resorting to unintegrated parton distributions which include information about the intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons @xmath31 , and the average transverse momentum gained during the interaction with the nucleus @xmath32 : @xmath33 .",
    "while the intrinsic @xmath31 is adjusted in p+p collisions , the gained transverse momentum is let to depend on the collision energy , centrality and @xmath34 of the detected hadron .",
    "* * color glass condensate*. the cgc approach resums all power corrections which are dominant in the high - energy / small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "it relies on two main assumptions : the scattering process is fully coherent and the propagation of the leading parton through the nucleus is eikonal , i.e. the momentum transfered during the collision is only transverse .",
    "then , non - linearities or saturation effects can be taken into account either at the semiclassical level or , more accurately , including the quantum corrections embodied in the jimwlk evolution equation .",
    "the work presented in c relies on a combination of both , with quantum corrections modeled according to analytical estimates @xcite .",
    "note that in the cgc framework , the saturation scale @xmath35 which characterizes the onset of non - linear effects in the nuclear wave function , also determines both the intrinsic transverse momentum and the amount of it gained during the collision . in the small-@xmath0 limit",
    ", it is not possible to distinguish saturation from multiple scatterings , such a separation would be frame dependent . both become important when a large gluon density is reached , and including one without the other is not consistent .    simply by looking at fig . 1",
    ", one concludes that the three different approaches above offer a comparably good description of the data , so it is difficult to extract any clean conclusion about the physical origin of the cronin enhancement .",
    "this is probably due to the kinematic region probed in these measurements . for a hadron momentum of @xmath36 gev ,",
    "one is sensitive to @xmath37 . in this region",
    "different physical mechanisms concur , so neither of the physical assumptions underlying the approaches above is comletely fulfilled .",
    "indeed , the coherence length , estimated to be @xmath38 fm is , on average , smaller than the nuclear length , so the fully coherent treatment of the collision implicit in the cgc is not completely justified , and large-@xmath0 corrections are expected to be relevant . moreover , both the coherent or incoherent treatments of the collision in @xcite need to invoke the presence of an intrinsic scale , presumably of non - perturbative origin , of the order of 1 gev in order to reproduce the data , whose dynamical origin is not evident at all .    .",
    "rhic data show that in the central - central case the away - side peak is similar in d+au and p+p collisions . in the central - forward case ,",
    "the glauber - eikonal ( left plot from @xcite ) and cgc ( right plot from @xcite ) calculations predict that the away - side peak is suppressed in d+au compared to p+p collisions , in agreement with later data.,title=\"fig:\",height=234 ] .",

    "let us focus on the @xmath39 dependence of the double - inclusive hadron spectrum , where @xmath39 is the difference between the azimuthal angles of the measured particles @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "nuclear effects on di - hadron correlations are typically evaluated in terms of the coincidence probability to , given a trigger particle in a certain momentum range , produce an associated particle in another momentum range . in a p+p or p+a collision ,",
    "the coincidence probability is given by @xmath42 with @xmath43 first measurements were performed at rhic at mid - rapidity by the phenix and star collaborations @xcite . in the central - central case , the coincidence probability features a near - side peak around @xmath44 when both measured particles belong to the same mini - jet , and an away - side peak around @xmath45 corresponding to hadrons produced back - to - back . in the central - forward case , there is naturally no near - side peak .    either in p+p or d+au collisions , the sizeable width of the away - side peak",
    "can not be described within the leading - twist collinear factorization framework .",
    "this indicates that , while it may not be obvious in single particle production , power corrections are important when @xmath36 gev . at such low transverse momenta , collinear factorization does not provide a global picture of particle production at rhic , even at mid - rapidity . on the contrary , both",
    "the glauber multiple scattering @xcite and cgc @xcite approaches can qualitatively describe the data , including the depletion of the away - side peak in d+au collisions when going from central - central to central - forward production .",
    "this is illustrated in .",
    "such a depletion does not occur in p+p collisions , it is due to nuclear - enhanced power corrections , and therefore the p+a to p+p ratio of the integrated coincidence probabilites @xmath46 is below unity .",
    "in , recent phenix data on @xmath47 are displayed as a function of centrality .",
    "at the moment , since @xmath6 is not that small , it is not clear whether the mechanism for this suppression is due to saturation effects rather than incoherent multiple scatterings .",

    "as outlined in the introduction , data collected in the deuteron fragmentation region offer a cleaner opportunity to explore saturation effects .",
    "let us first explain our implementation of the cgc framework .",

    "after the data confirmed the cgc expectations , it has been argued that the observed suppression of particle production at forward rapidities is not an effect associated to the small values of @xmath6 probed in the nuclear wave function , but rather to energy - momentum conservation corrections relevant for @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "this approach is clearly insufficient at very forward rapidities or large @xmath34 , where valence quarks of the projectile are important ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in , both formalisms give comparable results , as the lines from @xmath111-factorization overlap with the uncertainty bands spanned by the results from the hybrid formalism .",
    "this seems to identify a kinematical window where both approximations are valid .",
