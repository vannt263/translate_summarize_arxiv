    "on 2011 july 14 , the _ swift_/burst alert telescope ( bat ) triggered on several bursts of hard x - ray emission from the direction of a previously unknown source , subsequently named swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  @xcite .",
    "the spin period of the new source was soon identified to be @xmath6s @xcite and observations with _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) were used to further localize the position of the source @xcite .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these initial observations is that swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  is a magnetar . however , because of suggested similarities between swift  j1822.3@xmath01606and the unusual be x - ray binary j1626@xmath05156 , namely , a similar pulsed fraction and ir counterpart , it was suggested that perhaps swift  j1822.3@xmath01606is also a be x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis was challenged by @xcite , who , due to the lack of an optical counterpart @xcite , argued that the properties of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  are in line with those of other magnetars , in particular , the transient magnetar xte  j1810@xmath0197 . here",
    "we report on timing and flux properties of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  that rule out a be binary , and instead agree strongly with the magnetar identification .",
    "magnetars are neutron stars powered by the decay of extreme magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are thought to be observational manifestations of magnetars , and we refer to them as such here .",
    "magnetars exhibit x - ray bursts , spin periods ( @xmath7 ) in the relatively narrow rangepulsar / magnetar / main.html ] of 2    12s , and are observed to spin down with time . as inferred from @xmath7 and spin - down rate @xmath8 via the conventional vacuum dipole braking model that implies dipolar magnetic field strength @xmath9 g , their inferred dipole magnetic fields tend to be significantly larger than for classical pulsars , typically @xmath10 g .",
    "magnetars are also observed to display variability in nearly all of their observed properties : flux and pulsed flux variations , spectral variations , pulse profile variability , timing noise and glitches ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "the true underlying distribution of magnetic field strengths of magnetars is an open question .",
    "the recent discovery of a magnetar with a very low inferred magnetic field of @xmath11 g ( sgr  0418 + 5729 ; * ? ? ? * ) , has raised the question of how low the dipolar field can be for magnetar - like activity to be observed .",
    "moreover , the discovery of a magnetar - like outburst from the high-@xmath12 rotation - powered pulsar ( rpp ) j1846@xmath00258 @xcite highlights the question of whether rotation - powered pulsars and magnetars represent distinct classes of object , or if magnetars represent the high-@xmath12 tail of a single population .    in this letter",

    "128- and 64-bin template profiles were created by aligning and summing all _ rxte _  profiles .    to account for the different energy ranges and telescope responses between",

    "we used a subset of the available data to fit for the phase offsets ( mjd  55758  ",

    "we searched for time variability in the pulse profile and found that individual profiles are consistent with the template in each case except for the first observation after the outburst ( 96048 - 02 - 01 - 00 ) . in this case , the variation is subtle , at the @xmath50.015 phase level .",
    "we accounted for this by multiplying the corresponding toa uncertainty by three .    for each profile",
    ", we implemented a fourier domain filter by using six harmonics in the cross - correlation procedure with the appropriate 64- or 128-bin template .",
    "cross - correlation produces a toa for each observation with a typical uncertainty of @xmath527ms ( 0.32% of @xmath7 ) for _ rxte_toas , @xmath559ms ( 0.70% of @xmath7 ) for _ swift_toas , and @xmath523ms ( 0.27% of @xmath7 ) for _ cxo _  toas .",

    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : resids ] shows timing residuals with only spin - frequency ( @xmath22 ) fitted , while the bottom panel shows residuals with the frequency derivative ( @xmath23 ) also fitted .",

    "resulting phase residuals show minimal evidence for an unmodelled trend and fitting further parameters does not significantly improve the fit .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 imply a surface dipolar magnetic field of @xmath25 g .      to measure the source intensity and decay after the outburst , we first checked for the presence of dust scattering rings , such as those observed around 1e  1547@xmath05408 @xcite , because these will bias the inferred source count rate .",
    "we checked for deviations from the point - spread functions ( psfs ) in the first _ swift _  pc mode and _ cxo _",
    "observations following the outburst .",
    "the radial profiles were well fit by the model psfs , hence we found no evidence for dust scattering rings .    to measure the pulsed count rate for each _ swift _  and _ cxo_observation , the barycentered time series were folded with the ephemeris ( see table [ table : coherent ] and section  [ sec : timing ] ) , with 16 phase bins .",
    "the pulsed count rate for each folded profile in the 2  ",
    "10kev energy range was then determined using a root - mean - squared ( rms ) method .",
    "we calculate the rms pulsed count rate using fourier components as described in @xcite , using 5 fourier harmonics of the pulse profile .",
    "the pulsed fraction was then determined by dividing the pulsed count rate by the total source count rate .    to measure the pulsed count rate for _ rxte _  data",
    ", we created phase - resolved spectra with 16 bins using the software program to fold barycentered photons with the ephemeris ( table  [ table : coherent ] ) .",

    ", we included only data from pcu2 .",
    "pcu0 and pcu1 have lost propane layers , adversely affecting their particle background levels , and data available from pcu3 and pcu4 were minimal for this source .",
    "the rms method with 5 harmonics was then used to measure the pulsed count rate . because the pca is not a focusing instrument",
    "the pulsed fraction could not be accurately determined from these data .",
    "figure  [ fig : flux ] shows the evolution of the pulsed source intensity ( top panel , as measured with _",
    "swift _  and _ rxte _ ) , and the pulsed fraction ( bottom panel , as measured with",
    "_ swift _  and _ cxo _ ) .",
    "we present here the pulsed source intensity evolution only in terms of count rate , instead of fluxes .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis will follow in a subsequent paper .",
    "to describe this pulsed intensity decay quantitatively , we fit the pulsed count - rate evolution of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  in the 2  ",
    "10kev energy range with an exponential decay .",
    "pulsed count rates from a given source for _ rxte_and _ swift _  are different owing to instrumental effects ( e.g. effective area ) , but should be offset only by a constant , and trends should be the same between instruments ( as is observed here ) .",
    "thus , _ rxte _",
    "pca pulsed count rates were scaled to the _",
    "swift_xrt pulsed count rates .",
    "the scaling factor was chosen to be that which minimized the residuals of the fit to the pulsed count rates .",
    "the exponential decay is described by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the peak count rate , @xmath28 is the count rate in quiescence , @xmath29 is the time of the bat trigger in mjd and @xmath30 is the decay timescale in days . with a @xmath31 of 2.69 for 41 degrees of freedom ,",
    "the best - fit decay timescale is @xmath32 days .",
    "a power - law model was also fit to the decay , but it provided a much worse fit with a @xmath31 of 79 for 41 degrees of freedom .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : flux ] shows the evolution of the 2",
    "  10 kev pulsed fraction of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  for _ swift _  and _ cxo _  data . the pulsed fraction appears to have increased from @xmath535% immediately after the outburst until about one week after the bat trigger .",
    "it then remained constant at @xmath545% .",
    "the regular spin - down we report for swift  j1822.3@xmath01606 , together with a pulsed flux decay similar to that seen in other magnetar outbursts , demonstrates that this source indeed shares critical properties with other known magnetars ; we hence classify it as such .",
    "the inferred surface dipole @xmath12 for swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  of @xmath33 g is smaller than those of all but one confirmed magnetar , sgr  0418 + 5729 @xcite , though it is very close to that of axp 1e  2259 + 586 ( @xmath34 g ; * ? ? ?",
    "as for the latter , swift  j1822.3@xmath01606",
    "s @xmath12 is similar to that measured for several rpps , including the lone identified magnetically active rpp , psr  j1846@xmath00258 which has @xmath35 g @xcite .",
    "although enhanced spin - down could be present if the source suffered a large glitch at the outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the duration of our observations of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  ( 64days ) significantly exceeds the glitch recovery time scales measured in previous large magnetar glitches , so any contamination is likely to be small .",
    "interestingly , the most recently discovered magnetars ( including sgr  0418 + 5729 and swift  j1822.3@xmath01606 , but also sgrs  0501 + 4516 , 1833@xmath00832 and swift  j1834.9@xmath00846 ; g et al . 2010a , b ; rea et al .",
    "2010 , kuiper & hermsen 2011 ) all have @xmath36 g , effectively lowering the ` average ' inferred @xmath12-field for magnetars .",
    "this raises the question of what is the true distribution of magnetar field strengths . in figure",
    "[ fig : pbdist ] , we plot the distributions of the periods and inferred surface dipolar magnetic fields of all confirmed magnetars , as well as of all known @xmath37 g radio pulsars .",
    "the @xmath7 distribution of magnetars remains narrow , spanning less than an order of magnitude , in great contrast to those of radio pulsars .",
    "we note that the period distribution for magnetars is statistically consistent with being flat ; a fit to the histogram mean yields a @xmath38 of 0.63 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising and needs to be addressed in any future population studies .",
    "the @xmath12 distribution for observed magnetars , by contrast , appears more peaked , even with the relatively low @xmath12 we have measured for swift  j1822.3@xmath01606 , albeit with the possible low tail represented by sgr  0418 + 5729 .",
    "if the magnetars represent the high-@xmath12 tail of the @xmath12 distribution of all non - recycled neutron stars , then their peaked @xmath12 distribution may indicate that burst rates of these sources fall rapidly with decreasing @xmath12 , since the primary mechanism for their discovery is through their bursting behavior , particularly with the _ swift _  bat and _ fermi _ gbm",
    ". this would be broadly consistent with the theoretical findings of @xcite , who calculate expected burst rates in neutron stars and show that all neutron stars can show magnetar - like bursts , though the burst rate drops with decreasing @xmath12 and increasing age . that the distribution of radio pulsars plummets rapidly above @xmath39 g could genuinely be due to fall - off in the intrinsic distribution , or to smaller radio beams for these preferentially longer - period pulsars , but",
    "may also indicate that radio emission is harder to produce at higher @xmath12 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although radio emission has been observed for three magnetars @xcite , their radio spectra and radiative stabilities are vastly different than for conventional radio pulsars , suggesting a distinct emission mechanism .",
    "hence , if indeed we can ` unify ' radio pulsars and magnetars as described above , we expect the lowest @xmath12 magnetars to be the likeliest to produce observable traditional radio - pulsar - like radio emission , and the highest @xmath12 rpps to be the likeliest to show magnetar - like x - ray outbursts .",
    "the latter is consistent with the behavior of psr j1846@xmath00258 @xcite , while as yet , there is no evidence to support the former prediction .",
    "such a unification would also suggest that there exists a large population of as yet undetected @xmath39 g neutron stars that could be one day detected via their occasional magnetar - like bursts .",
    "the characteristic age ( @xmath40 ) for swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  is 450kyr , comparable to that of axp 1e  2259 + 586 but much larger than for all other magnetars , except for sgr  0418 + 5729 ( @xmath4124myr ) .",
    "1e  2259 + 586 is firmly associated with the supernova remnant ctb 109 which is thought to have an age of @xmath59kyr @xcite , much smaller than the axp s characteristic age of 250kyr .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath42 for magnetars can be unreliable true age indicators , which perhaps can be ascribed to epochs of greater spin - down torque early in the star s history , when the dipolar field was larger .",
    "indeed this hypothesis can also explain the large @xmath42 of sgr  0418 + 5729 , although the latter s greater distance from the galactic plane suggests it may indeed be the oldest known magnetar ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an alternative discussion ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that the observed properties of sgr  0418 + 5729 are consistent with it being an aged magnetar in which the external @xmath12 has decayed significantly .",
    "further evidence for sgr  0418 + 5729 being older than other magnetars includes lower energy bursts and a very low quiescent luminosity .",
    "whether swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  more closely resembles sgr  0418 + 5729 or 1e  2259 + 586 remains to be seen .",
    "the measurement of its flux in quiescence and the discovery of an associated supernova remnant would help resolve this issue .",
    "the post - outburst pulsed count rate evolution of swift  j1822.3@xmath01606  is best characterized by an exponential decay with timescale of 16.4@xmath40.3days .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed after several other magnetar outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though power - law decays are also common ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite predicted power - law decays in magnetar outbursts assuming crustal cooling following an impulsive heat injection .",
    "@xcite , by contrast , considered magnetar outbursts as a result of sudden twisting of magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , with the relaxation a result of their untwisting . in this model , the relaxation is predicted to be approximately linear , a functional form observed in one outburst of 1e  1048.1@xmath05937 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that other functional forms for the decay , including exponential , are possible , as the untwisting is predicted to be strongly non - uniform , being erased by a propagating ` front ' whose speed depends on the initial twist configuration .",
    "the diversity in functional forms for the flux decays of magnetars hence favors the model put forth by @xcite .",
