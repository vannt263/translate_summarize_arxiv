    "hilbert modular surfaces have been objects of extensive investigation in complex and algebraic geometry , and more recently in number theory .",
    "since hilbert modular varieties are moduli spaces for abelian varieties with real multiplication by an order in a totally real field , they have intrinsic arithmetic content .",
    "their geometry is enriched by the presence of modular subvarieties .    in the 1970s , hirzebruch , van de ven , and zagier @xcite",
    "computed the geometric invariants of many of these surfaces , and placed them within the enriques - kodaira classification .",
    "a chief aim of the present work is to compute equations for birational models of some of these surfaces over the field of rational numbers .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be a positive fundamental discriminant , i.e.  the discriminant of the ring of integers @xmath6 of the real quadratic field @xmath1 .",
    "the quotient @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the complex upper and lower half planes ) parametrizes abelian surfaces with an action of @xmath6 .",
    "it has a natural compactification @xmath0 , obtained by adding finitely many points and desingularizing these cusps .    these surfaces @xmath0 have models defined over @xmath5 , and the main goal of this paper is to describe a method to compute explicit equations for these models , as well as to carry out this method for all fundamental discriminants @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "this felt like a good place to stop for now , though these calculations may be extended to some higher  @xmath2 , as well as to non - fundamental discriminants .",
    "we briefly summarize the method , which we describe in more detail in later sections .",
    "the method relies on being able to explicitly parametrize k3 surfaces that are related by shioda - inose structure to abelian surfaces with real multiplication by some @xmath6 .",
    "the k3 surface corresponding to such an abelian surface has nron - severi lattice containing @xmath10 , a specific indefinite lattice of signature @xmath11 and discriminant @xmath12 . in all our examples ,",
    "we obtain the moduli space @xmath13 of @xmath10-polarized k3 surfaces as a family of elliptic surfaces with a specific configuration of reducible fibers and sections .",
    "we then use the @xmath4- and @xmath14-neighbor method to transform to another elliptic fibration , with two reducible fibers of types @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "this lets us read off the map ( generically one - to - one ) of moduli spaces from @xmath13 into the @xmath14-dimensional moduli space @xmath17 of principally polarized abelian surfaces , using the formulae from @xcite .",
    "the image of @xmath13 is the humbert surface corresponding to discriminant  @xmath2 .",
    "the hilbert modular surface @xmath0 itself is a double cover of the humbert surface , branched along a union of modular curves .",
    "we use simple lattice arguments to obtain the branch locus , and pin down the exact twist for the double cover by counting points on reductions of the related abelian surfaces modulo several primes . in all our examples , the humbert surface happens to be a rational surface ( i.e.  birational to @xmath18 over  @xmath5 ) , and we display the equation of @xmath0 as a double cover of @xmath18 branched over a curve of small degree .",
    "we analyze these equations in some detail , attempting to produce rational or elliptic curves on them , with the intent of producing several ( possibly infinitely many ) examples of genus @xmath4 curves whose jacobians have real multiplication .",
    "when @xmath0 is a k3 surface , it often has very high picard number ( @xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , and we attempt to compute generators for the picard group .",
    "when @xmath0 is an honestly elliptic surface , we analyze the singular fibers and the mordell - weil  group , and attempt to compute a basis for the sections .    to our knowledge , this is the first algebraic description of most of these surfaces by explicit equations .",
    "we outline some related work in the literature .",
    "wilson @xcite obtained equations for the hilbert modular surface @xmath21 corresponding to the smallest fundamental discriminant @xmath22 . in  @xcite",
    ", van der geer gives a few examples of algebraic equations for hilbert modular surfaces corresponding to a congruence subgroup of the full modular group ( in other words , abelian surfaces with some level structure ) .",
    "humbert surfaces have also been well - studied in the literature , and @xcite have obtained equations for some of these . however , these equations are quite complicated , and do not shed as much light on the geometry of hilbert modular surfaces . while the methods are simpler , involving theta functions and @xmath23-expansions , the result is analogous to exhibiting the modular polynomial whose zero locus in @xmath24 is a singular model of the complement of the cusps in the modular curve @xmath25 .",
    "the coefficients of these polynomials can quickly become enormous .",
    "we believe that our approach , giving simpler equations for these surfaces together with their maps to @xmath26 , is more conducive to an investigation of arithmetic properties .",
    "it is our hope that these equations will be of much help in subsequent arithmetic investigation of these surfaces . for instance",
    ", they should provide a testing ground for many conjectures in diophantine geometry , because of the abundance of rational curves and points .",
    "another direction of future investigation is to use these equations to investigate modularity of the corresponding abelian surfaces .",
    "modularity of abelian varieties with real multiplication over  @xmath5 is now proven , by combining results of ribet  @xcite with the recent proof of serre s conjecture by khare and wintenberger @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the case of dimension  @xmath27 , where one has modular parametrizations and very good control of the moduli spaces , the situation in dimensions @xmath4 and above is much less clear .",
    "for instance , it is not at all clear how to find a modular form corresponding to a given abelian surface with real multiplication .",
    "is an abelian surface with by @xmath6 , and let @xmath28 be an eigenform with every @xmath29 . if @xmath30 corresponds to  @xmath31 then counting points over @xmath32 and @xmath33 determines each @xmath34 up to galois conjugation .",
    "but conceivably there might be some eigenform @xmath35 , different from both @xmath30 and its galois conjugate , such that each @xmath36 equals either @xmath34 or the galois conjugate of @xmath34 ;",
    "if that happens , we do not know how to decide which eigenform corresponds to  @xmath31 . likewise for abelian varieties of dimension @xmath14 and higher .",
    "] we hope that the abundance of examples provided by these equations will help pave the path for a better understanding of the @xmath4-dimensional case .",
    "for example , in @xcite , our formulas are combined with efficient computation of hilbert modular forms to find examples of simple abelian surfaces over real quadratic fields , with everywhere good reduction .",
    "an example of such an abelian surface is the jacobian of the genus @xmath4 curve @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( the curve and its jacobian can in fact be defined over  @xmath5 , but the jacobian attains everywhere good reduction and real multiplication by @xmath39 only over @xmath40 ) .",
    "the outline for the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ k3 ]",
    ", we describe the relevant background on k3 surfaces and their moduli spaces , and their connection to moduli spaces of abelian surfaces via shioda - inose structures . in section [ realmult ]",
    ", we describe the hilbert modular surfaces and the corresponding moduli spaces of k3 surfaces . in section [ method ]",
    ", we precisely describe our methods to compute their equations .",
    "section [ neighbors ] describes the @xmath4- and @xmath14-neighbor method in more detail .",
    "the rest of the paper consists of detailed examples of hilbert modular surfaces for the discriminants less than @xmath41 , as well as an arithmetic investigation of these surfaces .",
    "the accompanying auxiliary files contain formulas for the igusa - clebsch invariants , as well as a description of the parametrizations exhibited for the moduli spaces of k3 surfaces in the paper , and the details of the neighbor steps to transform to a fibration with @xmath42 and @xmath43 fibers .",

    "this will produce not only the latex file for this paper , but also the computer code .",

    "throughout this section , we work with k3 surfaces over a field @xmath44 of characteristic @xmath45 .",
    "when convenient , we will suppose @xmath46 , and use transcendental methods .",
    "a k3 surface @xmath47 over @xmath44 is a projective algebraic nonsingular surface with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "the nron - severi group @xmath59 of algebraic divisors defined over  @xmath60 modulo algebraic equivalence , which for a k3 surface is the same as linear or numerical equivalence , is a primitive sublattice of  @xmath56 of signature @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the picard number of @xmath47 .",
    "the orthogonal complement of @xmath59 is the transcendental lattice @xmath63 .",
    "there is a torelli theorem for k3 surfaces , due to piatetski - shapiro and shafarevich @xcite and friedman  @xcite , which describes the moduli space of k3 surfaces with a fixed polarization .",
    "more generally , let @xmath64 be an even non - degenerate lattice of signature @xmath65 , with @xmath66 .",
    "assume that @xmath64 has a unique primitive embedding in @xmath56 , up to isometries of @xmath56 .",

    "the reader may consult nikulin  @xcite and dolgachev  @xcite .",

    "in fact , most of the time we can even make do with the weaker assumption that @xmath493 has discriminant in the square class of @xmath2 , since ( 3 ) guarantees that @xmath31 has real multiplication by an order in @xmath1 .",

    "now , assume that @xmath31 has real multiplication by @xmath510 , defined over @xmath32 , and let @xmath519 , as before .",

    "we conclude this section with a few comments on the models of hilbert modular surfaces computed in this paper .",
    "we first give formulas for the family of elliptic k3 surfaces over @xmath327 , and then describe the @xmath4- and @xmath14-neighbor steps necessary to reach the alternate fibration of step 2 .",

    "steps 3 and 4 are relatively easy to automate .",
    "we simply write down the result , which is the equation of @xmath0 as a double cover of the humbert surface .",
    "we give a table of points of small height for which the brauer obstruction vanishes , and the associated curves of genus two . we also analyze the hilbert modular surface further in the cases that we can describe it as a k3 or honestly elliptic surface . in particular , we determine the ( geometric ) picard number and generators for the mordell - weil group of sections in most of the cases .",
    "we also analyze the branch locus of step 3 , identifying it with a union of quotients of classical modular curves in several cases , with the help of explicit formulas given in  @xcite or obtained by the methods of that paper .",
    "finally , for many discriminants , we are able to exhibit curves of low genus on the surface , possessing infinitely many rational points .    we found the method of van luijk @xcite quite useful in determining the ranks of the nron - severi lattices of these surfaces .",

    "finally , we describe how to transform from one elliptic fibration to another , using 2- and 3-neighbor steps .",
    "we start with an elliptic k3 surface over a field @xmath44 , which we assume has characteristic different from @xmath4 or @xmath14 .",

    "the surface @xmath47 is a minimal proper model of a given weierstrass equation @xmath545 here the elliptic fibration is @xmath546 .",

    "the space of global sections @xmath549 has dimension @xmath4 over @xmath44 .",

    "any global section gives a section of the generic fiber @xmath551 , which is an elliptic curve over @xmath552 .",
    "therefore , if we have a basis of global sections of @xmath553 over @xmath554 , say @xmath555 ( where @xmath556 ) , we can assume that any global section of @xmath557 is of the form @xmath558 we can now use the information from @xmath559 , which gives us conditions about the zeroes and poles of the functions @xmath560 , to find the linear conditions cutting out @xmath549 , which will be two - dimensional .",
    "when @xmath561 , we say that going between these elliptic fibrations is an @xmath466-neighbor step .",
    "we will explain the reason for this terminology shortly .",
    "in this paper we use only @xmath4- and @xmath14-neighbor steps .",
    "first , we describe how to convert to a genus  @xmath27 curve in the case when @xmath562 or @xmath563 .",
    "these are the most familiar cases of the @xmath4- and @xmath14-neighbor steps , and the other cases of the two - neighbor step that are needed are more exhaustively described in @xcite .",
    "suppose the case @xmath564 .",
    "then @xmath565 is a basis of the global sections .",
    "therefore , on  @xmath47 we obtain two global sections @xmath27 and @xmath566 for some @xmath567 .",
    "the ratio of these two sections gives the elliptic parameter @xmath550 .",
    "we set @xmath568 , and substitute into the weierstrass equation to obtain an equation @xmath569 because @xmath547 is an elliptic divisor , the generic fiber of this surface over @xmath570 is a curve of genus @xmath27 .",
    "thus , once we absorb square factors into @xmath571 we obtain an equivalent @xmath572 that is a polynomial of degree @xmath14 or  @xmath169 in  @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath573 is standard form of the equation of a genus-@xmath27 curve as a branched double cover of @xmath103 .",
    "suppose @xmath574 .",
    "then @xmath575 is a basis of global sections . on  @xmath47",
    "we obtain two global sections @xmath27 and @xmath576 .",
    "we set the ratio equal to @xmath550 , solve for @xmath359 , and substitute into the weierstrass equation to obtain @xmath577 this equation is of degree @xmath14 in @xmath163 , and after some simple algebra ( scaling and shifting @xmath163 ) , we may arrange it to have degree @xmath14 in @xmath92 as well .",
    "we end up with a plane cubic curve , which is the standard model of a genus-@xmath27 curve with a degree @xmath14 line bundle .    finally , if we also know that the elliptic fibration corresponding to @xmath547 has a section ( which follows in each of our examples by proposition [ automaticsections ] ) , then it is isomorphic to the jacobian of the genus-@xmath27 curve we have computed .",
    "we may use standard formulas to write down the weierstrass equation of the jacobian ( see @xcite and the references cited therein ) , and this is the desired weierstrass equation for the elliptic fibration with fiber @xmath547 .    this neighbor step from @xmath102 to  @xmath547 corresponds to computing an explicit isomorphism between two presentations @xmath578 and @xmath579 of @xmath59 . note that @xmath580 , where @xmath581 refers to the orthogonal complement in @xmath59 .",
    "the sublattice @xmath582 projects to an index @xmath466 sublattice of both @xmath583 and @xmath584 , where @xmath585 . therefore these lattices are @xmath466-neighbors .",
