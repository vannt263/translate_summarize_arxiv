    "more often than not some physical truths , as they gain general acceptance , enter textbooks and become stock rules , loose their exact content for the majority of the physics community .",
    "moreover , in this way superficially understood rules may turn to superfluous taboos inhibiting to study new phenomena .",
    "for example , conviction that  uniformly moving charge does not radiate  caused a considerable delay in discovering and understanding the cherenkov effect . by the way , even the refined statement  uniformly moving charge does not radiate in vacuum  is not exact as it excludes the so - called transition radiation known an half of century only , despite it is a purely classical effect of macroscopic electrodynamics .    in this paper",
    "we give an overview of electromagnetic versions of the so - called x - type waves intensively studied since 1990.-ies  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the results obtained have encountered such taboo - fashioned attitudes sometimes .",
    "indeed , these waves , or more exactly  wavepackets , may be extremely localized both laterally and longitudinally and , what is most startling , propagate superluminally without apparent diffraction or spread as yet .",
    "furthermore , they are solutions - although exotic - of linear wave equations and , hence , have nothing to do with solitons or other localization phenomena known in contemporary nonlinear science .",
    "instead , study of these solutions has in a sense reincarnated some almost forgotten ideas and findings of mathematical physics of the previous turn of the century .",
    "x - type waves belong to phenomena where a naive superluminality taboo  group velocity can not exceed the speed of light in vacuum  is broken . in this respect",
    "they fall into the same category as plane waves in dispersive resonant media and the evanescent waves , propagation of which ( photon tunneling ) has provoked much interest since publication of papers   @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .therefore it is not surprising that tunneling of x waves in frustrated internal reflection has been treated in a recent theoretical paper  @xcite .",
    "indeed , studies conducted in different subfields of physics , which are dealing with superluminal movements , are interfering and merging fruitfully . a convincing proof of this trend is the given conference and the collection of its papers in hand .",
    "this is why in this paper we spotlight just superluminality of the x waves , which is now an experimentally verified fact  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , but which should not be considered as their most interesting attribute in general .",
    "their name was coined within theoretical ultrasonics by the authors of the paper @xcite which initiated an intensive study of the x waves , particularly due to outlooks of application in medical ultrasonic imaging .",
    "possible superluminality of electromagnetic localized waves was touched by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite  who had derived the waves under name ",
    "slingshot pulses  independently from the paper  @xcite  and became the focus of growing interest thanks to e .recami",
    "( see  @xcite and references therein ) , who pointed out physically deeply meaningful resemblance between the shape of the x waves and that of the tachyon  @xcite .",
    "the paper  @xcite was published in times of great activity in theoretical study of these hypothetical superluminal particles . to these years",
    "belongs paper  @xcite where a double - cone - shaped  electromagnetic tachyon  as a result of light reflection by a conical mirror was considered .",
    "this a quarter - of - century - old paper seems to be the very pioneering work on x - waves , though this and the subsequent papers of the same author have been practically unknown and only very recently were rediscovered for the x wave community ( see references in the review  @xcite ) .",
    "last but not least , if one asked what was the very first sort of superluminal waves implemented in physics , the answer would be  realistic plane waves . indeed , as it is well known , the most simple physically feasible realization of a plane wave beam is the gaussian beam with its bounded cross - section and , correspondingly , a finite energy flux .",
    "however , much less is known that due to the gouy phase shift the group velocity in the waist region of the gaussian beam is slightly superluminal , what one can readily check on the analytical expressions for the beam ( see also ref .",
    "for all the reasons mentioned , in this paper we present  after an introduction of the physical nature of the x - type waves ( section 2 ) - quite in detail a new representation of the localized waves ( section 3 ) .",
    "this representation  what we believe is a new and useful addition into the theory of x - type waves  in a sense generalizes the huygens principle into superluminal domain and directly relies on superluminality of focal behavior of any type of free - space waves , which manifests itself in the gouy phase shift .",
    "the startling superluminality issues are briefly discussed in the last section .",
    "figures showing 3-dimensional plots have been included for a vivid comprehension of the spatio - temporal shape of the waves , however , only few of the animations showed in the oral presentation had sense to be reproduced here in the static black - and - white form .",
    "the bibliography is far from being complete , but hopefully a number of related references can be found in other papers of the issue in hand .",
    "in order to make the physical nature of the x - type superluminal localized waves better comprehensible , we first discuss a simple representation of them as a result of interference between plane wave pulses .    figure1s.ps    fig.1 .",
    "x - type scalar wave formed by scalar plane wave pulses containing three cosinusoidal cycles . the propagation direction ( along the axis @xmath0 )",
    "is indicated by arrow . as linear gray - scale plots in a plane of the propagation axis and at a fixed instant , shown are ( a ) the field of the wave ( real part if the plane waves are given as analytic signals ) and ( b ) its amplitude ( modulus ) .",
    "note that the central bullet - like part of the wave would stand out even more sharply against the sidelobes if one plotted the the distribution of the intensity ( modulus squared ) of the wave .    with reference to fig.1(a )",
    "let us consider a pair of plane wave bursts possessing identical temporal dependences and the wave vectors in the plane @xmath1 .",
    "their propagation directions given by unit vectors @xmath2   $ ] and @xmath3   $ ] are tilted under angle @xmath4 with respect to the axis @xmath5 in spatio - temporal regions where the pulses do not overlap their field is given simply by the burst profile as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spatial coordinate along the direction @xmath8 or @xmath9 , respectively . in the overlap region , if we introduce the radius vector of a field point @xmath10   $ ] the field is given by superposition @xmath11  which is nothing but the well - known two - wave - interference pattern with doubled amplitudes .",
    "altogether , the superposition of the pulse pair  as two branches @xmath12and / form the letter x  makes up  an x - shaped propagation - invariant interference pattern moving along the axis @xmath0 with speed @xmath13 which is both the phase and the group velocity of the wave field in the direction of the propagation axis @xmath0 .",
    "this speed is superluminal in a similar way as one gets a faster - than - light movement of a bright stripe on a screen when a plane wave light pulse is falling at the angle @xmath4 onto the screen plane .",
    "let us stress that here we need not to deal with the vagueness of the physical meaning inherent to the group velocity in general  simply the whole spatial distribution of the field moves rigidly with @xmath14 because the time enters into the eq.([2tasalainet ] ) only together with the coordinate @xmath0 through the propagation variable @xmath15 .",
    "further let us superimpose axisymmetrically all such pairs of waves whose propagation directions form a cone around the axis @xmath0 with the top angle @xmath16 , in other words , let the pair of the unit vectors be @xmath17   $ ] and @xmath18   $ ] , where the angle @xmath19 runs from @xmath20 to @xmath21 degrees . as a result",
    ", we get an x - type supeluminal localized wave in the following simple representation @xmath22   = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}% d\\phi\\ \\psi_{p}\\left (   \\mathbf{r}_{t}\\mathbf{n}_{/}\\right )   \\ , \\label{bxfieldfin}%\\ ] ] where @xmath23   $ ] is the radius vector of a field point in the copropagating frame and cylindrical coordinates @xmath24 have been introduced for we restrict ourselves in this paper to axisymmetric or so - called zeroth - order x - type waves only . hence , according to eq.([bxfieldfin ] ) the field is built up from interfering pairs of identical bursts of plane waves .",
    "fig.1 gives an example in which the plane wave profile @xmath25 contains three cycles .",
    "the less extended the profile @xmath25 , the better the separation and resolution of the branches of the x - shaped field . in the superposition",
    "the points of completely constructive interference lie on the @xmath0 axis , where the highly localized energy  bullet  arises in the center , while the intensity falls off as @xmath26 along the branches and much faster in all other directions ( note that in contrast with fig.1(a ) in the case of interference of only two waves the on - axis and off - axis maxima must be of equal strength ) .",
    "the optical carrier manifests itself as one or more ( depending on the number of cycles in the pulse ) halo toroids which are nothing but residues of the concentric cylinders of intensity characteristic of the bessel beam . that is why we use the term bessel - x pulse ( or wave ) to draw a distinction from carrierless x waves . by making use of an integral representation of the zeroth - order bessel function @xmath27   d\\phi\\ $ ] , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary angle , and by reversing the mathematical procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we get the common representation of x - type waves as superposition of monochromatic cylindrical modes ( bessel beams ) of different wavenumber @xmath29 @xmath30 \\ , \\label{bx_k - esituses}%\\ ] ] where @xmath31 denotes the fourier spectrum of the profile @xmath25 .",
    "again , the eq.([bx_k - esituses ] ) gives for both the phase and the group velocities ( along the axis @xmath0  in the direction of the propagation of the packet of the cylindrical waves ) the superluminal value @xmath13 .",
    "although the representation eq.([bxfieldfin ] ) of the x - type waves as built up from two - plane - wave - pulse interference patterns constitutes an easily comprehensible approach to the superluminality issues , it may turn out to be counter - intuitive for symmetry considerations as will be shown below . in this section",
    "we develope another representation introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is , in a sense , a generalization of the huygens principle into superluminal domain and allows figuratively to describe formation of superluminal localized waves .",
    "as known in electrodynamics , the dalambert ( source - free ) wave equation possesses a particular solution @xmath32 , which is spherically symmetric and can be expressed through retarded and advanced green functions of the equation , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , as @xmath35   = \\frac{1}{4\\pi rc}\\left [ \\delta(r - ct)-\\delta(r+ct)\\right ]   \\ , \\label{d0defn}%\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the distance from the origin and @xmath37 is the dirac delta function .",
    "thus , the function @xmath32 represents a spherical delta - pulse - shaped wave , first ( at negative times @xmath38 ) converging to the origin ( the right term ) and then ( at positive times @xmath38 ) diverging from it .",
    "the minus sign between the two terms , which results from the requirement that a source - free field can not have a singular point @xmath39 , is of crucial importance as it assures vanishing of the function at @xmath40 .",
    "this change of the sign when the wave goes through the collapsed stage at the focus is also responsible for the @xmath41 degrees phase factor associated with the huygens - fresnel - kirchhoff principle and for the gouy phase shift peculiar to all focused waves . from eq.([d0defn ] ) , using the common procedure one can calculate linard - wiechert  potentials for a moving point charge @xmath42 flying , e.g. with a constant velocity @xmath14 along axis @xmath0 . however , as @xmath32  includes not only the retarded green function but also the advanced one and therefore what is moving has to be considered as a source coupled with a sink at the same point . for such a huygens - type source",
    "there is no restriction @xmath43 and for superluminal velocity @xmath44 we obtain axisymmetric scalar and vector potentials ( in cgs units , lorentz gauge)@xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the radial distance of the field point from the axis @xmath0 , the velocity vector is @xmath48 $ ] , and @xmath49{c}% \\theta\\left [   -(z - vt)-\\rho\\sqrt{v^{2}/c^{2}-1}\\right ]   -\\\\ -\\theta\\left [   ( z - vt)-\\rho\\sqrt{v^{2}/c^{2}-1}\\right ] \\end{array } \\right\\ }   \\ , \\label{sommerfi}%\\ ] ] where @xmath50 denotes the heaviside step function . here for the sake of simplicity we do not calculate the electromagnetic field vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( or * *  * * @xmath53 * * ) * * , neither will we consider dipole sources and sinks required for obtaining non - axisymmetric fields .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to scalar fields obtained as superpositions of the potential given by the eq.([sommerfi ] ) .",
    "the first of the two terms in the eq.([sommerfi ] ) gives an electromagnetic mach cone of the superluminally flying charge @xmath42 .",
    "in other words  it represents nothing but a shock wave emitted by a superluminal electron in vacuum , mathematical expression for which was found by sommerfeld three decades earlier than tamm and frank worked out the theory of the cherenkov effect , but which was forgotten as an unphysical result after the special theory of relativity appeared  @xcite . the second term in the eq.([sommerfi ] ) describes a leading and reversed mach cone collapsing into the superluminal sink coupled with the source and thus feeding the latter .",
    "hence , the particular solution to the wave equation which is given by the eq.([sommerfi ] ) represents a double - cone - shaped pulse propagating rigidly and superluminally along the axis @xmath0 .",
    "in other words  it represents an x - type wave as put together from ( i ) the cone of incoming waves collapsing into the sink , thereby generating a superluminal huygens - type point source and from ( ii ) wakewave - type radiation cone of the source .",
    "let it be recalled that the field given by the eq.([sommerfi ] ) had been found for @xmath37-like spatial distribution of the charge . that is why the field diverges on the surface of the double cone or on any of its",
    "x - shaped generatrices given by @xmath54 and the field can be considered as an elementary one constituting a base for constructing various x - type waves through appropriate linear superpositions .",
    "hence , any axisymmetric x - type wave could be correlated to its specific  ( continuous and time - dependent )  distribution @xmath55  of the  charge  ( or the sink - and - source ) with linear  density @xmath56  on the propagation axis , while the superluminal speed of the wave corresponds to the velocity @xmath14 of propagation of that distribution along the axis , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "let us introduce a superluminal version of the lorentz transformation coefficient @xmath58 , where @xmath4 is the axicon angle considered earlier and let us first choose the  charge ",
    "distribution @xmath59 as a lorentzian . in this case",
    "the field potential is given as convolution of eq.([sommerfi ] ) with the normalized distribution , which can be evaluated using fourier and laplace transform tables : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the hwhm of the distribution and @xmath15 is , as in the preceding section , the axial variable in the co - propagating frame .",
    "the resulting potential shown in fig.2 ( a ) moves rigidly along the axis @xmath0 ( from left to right in fig.2 ) with the same superluminal speed @xmath62 .",
    "the plot ( a ) depicts qualitatively also the elementary potential as far as the divergences of the eq.([sommerfi ] ) are smoothed out in the eq.([fieldim ] ) .",
    "fig.2 . dependence on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath63 ( increasing from the left to the right ) and a lateral one @xmath64 of the imaginary ( a ) and real ( b ) parts of the field of the simplest x - wave .",
    "the velocity @xmath65  and , correspondingly , the superluminality parameter @xmath66 .",
    "distance between grid lines on the basal plane is @xmath67 along the axis @xmath68 and @xmath69along@xmath70the lateral axis , the unit being the half - width @xmath61 .    we see that an unipolar and even",
    "distribution gives an odd and bipolar potential , as expected , while the symmetry of the plot differs from what might be expected from superimposing two plane wave pulses under the tilt angle @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , in the latter case the plane waves are depicted by each of the two diagonal branches ( @xmath12and / ) of the x - shaped plot and therefore the profile of the potential on a given branch has to retain its sign and shape if one moves from one side of the central interference region to another side along the same branch .",
    "disappearance of the latter kind of symmetry , which can be most distinctly followed in the case of bipolar single - cycle pulses  just the case of fig.2 a  is due to mutual interference of all the plane wave pairs forming the cone as @xmath19 runs from @xmath20 to @xmath71 .",
    "secondly , let us take the ",
    "distribution as a dispersion curve with the same width parameter @xmath61 , i.e. as the hilbert transform of the lorentzian .",
    "again , using fourier and laplace transform tables , we readily obtain : @xmath72    the potential of the eq.([fieldre ] ) depicted in fig.2 ( b ) is  with accuracy of a real constant multiplier ",
    "nothing but the well - known zeroth - order unipolar x wave , first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and studied in a number of papers afterwards .",
    "hence , we have demonstrated here how the real and imaginary part of the simplest x - wave solution @xmath73  of the free - space wave equation can be represented as fields generated by corresponding ",
    "sink - and - source charge ",
    "distributions moving superluminally along the propagation axis . the procedure how to find for a given axisymmetric x - type wave its  generator charge distribution ",
    "is readily derived from a closer inspection of the eq.([sommerfi ] ) .",
    "namely , on the axis @xmath0 , i.  e. for @xmath74 , the eq.([sommerfi ] ) constitutes the hilbert transform kernel for the convolution .",
    "therefore , the  charge ",
    "distribution can be readily found as the hilbert image of the on - axis profile of the potential and vice versa .",
    "hence , we have obtained a figurative representation in which the superluminal waves can be classified _ via _ the distribution and other properties of the huygens - type sources propagating superluminally along the axis and thus generating the wave field  @xcite . such representation",
    " which may be named as sommerfeld representation to acknowledge his unfortunate result of 1904  has been generalized to nonaxisymmetric and vector fields and applied by us to various known localized waves @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal - lateral dependences of the real part ( a ) and the modulus ( b ) of the field of the bessel - x wave . the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath75 are the same as in fig.2 .",
    "the new parameter of the wave  the wavelength @xmath76 of the optical carrier being the unit , the distance between grid lines on the basal plane is @xmath77 along the axis @xmath68 and @xmath78along@xmath70the lateral axis , while the half - width @xmath79 .",
    "for visible light pulses @xmath80 is in sub - micrometer range , which means that the period of the cycle as well as full duration of the pulse on the propagation axis are as short as a couple of femtoseconds .",
    "for example , in optical domain one has to deal with the so - called bessel - x wave   @xcite-@xcite , which is a band - limited and oscillatory version of the x wave .",
    "it is obvious that for the bessel - x wave the  charge ",
    "distribution contains oscillations corresponding to the optical carrier of the pulse .",
    "bandwidth ( fwhm ) equal to ( or narrower than ) the carrier frequency roughly corresponds to 2 - 3 ( or more ) distinguishable oscillation cycles of the field as well as of the  charge  along the propagation axis .",
    "fortunately , few - cycle light pulses are affordable in contemporary femtosecond laser optics . on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of the oscillations in the bessel - x wave pulse ( on the axis @xmath0 ) is of the order @xmath81 , the x - branching occurs too far from the propagation axis , i.e. in the outer region where the field practically vanishes and , with further increase of @xmath82 , the field becomes just a truncated bessel beam .",
    "the analytic expression for a bessel - x wave depends on specific choice of the oscillatory function or , equivalently , of the fourier spectrum of the pulse on the axis @xmath0 .",
    "one way to obtain a bessel - x wave possessing approximately @xmath82 oscillations is to take a derivative of the order @xmath83 from the eq.([xwave ] ) with respect to @xmath84 ( or @xmath0 or @xmath38 ) , which according to eqs.([fieldim]),([fieldre ] ) is equivalent to taking the same derivative from the distribution function .",
    "the @xmath85th temporal derivative of the common x wave can be expressed in closed form through the associated legendre polynoms   @xcite .",
    "another way is to use the following expression , which for @xmath86 approximates well the field of the bessel - x wave with a near - gaussian spectrum  @xcite,@xcite    @xmath87   \\cdot j_{0}\\left [   z(z_{t})\\,k_{z}\\rho/\\gamma\\right ]   \\cdot\\exp(ik_{z}z_{t})\\ , \\label{bx}%\\ ] ] where complex - valued function @xmath88 makes the argument of the bessel function also complex",
    ".the longitudinal wavenumber @xmath89  together with the half - width @xmath61 ( at @xmath90-amplitude level on the axis @xmath0 ) are the parameters of the pulse . again , dependence on @xmath91 through the single propagation variable @xmath92 indicates the propagation - invariance of the wave field shown in fig.3 .",
    "limited aperture of practically realizable x - type waves causes an abrupt decay of the interference structure of the wave after flying rigidly over a certain distance .",
    "however , the depth of invariant propagation of the central spot of the wave can be made substantial  by the factor @xmath93 larger than the aperture diameter .",
    "such type of electromagnetic pulses , enabling directed , laterally and temporally concentrated and nonspreading propagation of wavepacket energy through space - time have a number of potential applications in various areas of science and technology .",
    "let us briefly consider some results obtained along this line .",
    "any ultrashort laser pulse propagating in a dispersive medium  even in air  suffers from a temporal spread , which is a well - known obstacle in femtosecond optics . for the bessel - x wave with its composite nature",
    ", however , there exists a possibility to suppress the broadening caused by the group - velocity dispersion  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "namely , the dispersion of the angle @xmath4 , which is to a certain extent inherent in any bessel - x wave generator , can be played against the dispersion of the medium with the aim of their mutual compensation .",
    "the idea has been verified in an experimental setup with the lateral dimension and the width of the temporal autocorrelation function of the bessel - x wave pulses , respectively , of the order of 20 microns and 200 fs  @xcite .",
    "thus , an application of optical x - type waves has been worked out  a method of designing femtosecond pulsed light fields that maintain their strong ( sub - millimeter range ) longitudinal and lateral localization in the course of superluminal propagation into a considerable depth of a given dispersive medium .",
    "optical bessel - x waves allow to accomplish a sort of diffraction - free transmission of arbitrary 2-dimensional images  @xcite,@xcite . despite its highly localized ",
    "diffraction - free  bright central spot , the zeroth - order monochromatic bessel beam behaves poorly in a role of point - spread function in 2-d imaging .",
    "the reason is that its intensity decays too slowly with lateral distance , i.e. as @xmath94 . on the contrary",
    ", the bessel - x wave is offering a loop hole to overcome the problem . despite the time - averaged intensity of",
    "the bessel - x wave possesses the same slow radial decay @xmath94 due to the asymptotic behavior along the x - branches , an instantaneous intensity has the strong gaussian localization in lateral cross - section at the maximum of the pulse and therefore it might serve as a point - spread function with well - constrained support but also with an extraordinary capability to maintain the image focused without any spread over large propagation depths . by developing further this approach it is possible to build a specific communication system  @xcite .",
    "ideas of using the waves in high - energy physics for particle acceleration  one of such was proposed already two decades ago  @xcite   are not much developed as yet .",
    "it is obvious that for a majority of possible applications the spread - free central spot is the most attractive peculiarity of the x - type waves .",
    "the better the faster the intensity decay along lateral directions and x - branches is . in this respect a new type of x waves",
    " recently discovered focused x wave  @xcite  seems to be rather promising .    as one can see in fig.4 . and by inspecting an analytical expression for the wave @xmath95   \\right ] \\ ; , \\label{fx}%\\ ] ]    where @xmath96   ^{2}+\\left ( \\rho\\,/\\gamma\\right )   ^{2}}$ ] and @xmath97 is a parameter of carrier wavenumber type , the wave is very well localized indeed .",
    "however , like luminal localized waves called focus wave modes  @xcite,@xcite , for this wave propagation - invariant is the intensity only , while the wave field itself changes during propagation in an oscillatory manner due to the last phase factor @xmath98   \\right ]   $ ] in the eq.([fx ] ) , which has another @xmath91-dependence than through the propagation variable @xmath15 .",
    "an animated version of fig.4(a ) , made for the oral presentation of the paper , shows that the oscillatory modulation moves in the direction @xmath99 , i.e. opposite to the pulse propagation .",
    "the longitudinal - lateral dependences of the real part ( a ) and the modulus ( b ) of the field of the focused x wave .",
    "the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "distance between grid lines on the basal plane is @xmath67 along both axes .",
    "@xmath102 .    to our best knowledge ,",
    "the superluminal focused x wave has not realized experimentally yet , but probably the approach worked out for luminal focus wave modes recently  @xcite may help to accomplish that .",
    "let us make finally some remarks on the intriguing superluminality issues of the x - type wave pulses .",
    "indeed , while  phase velocities greater than @xmath103 are well known in various fields of physics , a superluminal group velocity more often than not is considered as a taboo , because at first glance it seems to be at variance with the special theory of relativity , particularly , with the relativistic causality .",
    "however , since the beginning of the previous century  starting from sommerfeld s works on plane - wave pulse propagation in dispersive media and precursors appearing in this process ",
    "it is known that group velocity need not to be a physically profound quantity and by no means should be confused with signal propagation velocity .",
    "but in case of x - type waves not only the group velocity exceeds @xmath103 but the pulse as whole propagates rigidly faster than @xmath103 .",
    "a diversity of interpretations concerning this startling but experimentally verified fact  @xcite,@xcite can be encountered . on the one end of the scale are claims , based on a sophisticated mathematical consideration , that the relativistic causality is violated in case of these pulses  @xcite .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite devoted to this issue proves , however , that the causality is not violated globally in the case of the x - type waves , but still the author admits a possibility of noncausal signalling locally .    on the opposite end of the scale",
    "are statements insisting that the pulse is not a real one but simply an interference pattern rebuilt at every point of its propagation axis from truly real plane wave constituents travelling at a slight tilt with respect to the axis .",
    "such argumentation is not wrong but brings us nowhere .",
    "of course , there is a similarity between superluminality of the x wave and a faster - than - light movement of the cutting point in the scissors effect or of a bright stripe on a screen when a plane wave light pulse is falling at the angle @xmath4 onto the screen plane .",
    "but in the central highest - energy part of the x wave there is nothing moving at the tilt angle .",
    "the phase planes are perpendicular to the axis and the whole field moves rigidly along the axis . the pointing vector lays also along the axis , however , the energy flux is not superluminal .",
    "hence , to consider the x waves as something inferior compared to  real ",
    "pulses is not sound .",
    "similar logic would bring one to a conclusion that femtosecond pulses emitted by a mode - locked laser are not real but  simply an interference  between the continuous - wave laser modes .",
    "in other words , one would ignore the superposition principle of linear fields , which implies reversible relation between  resultant  and  constituent  fields and does not make any of possible orthogonal basis inferior than others .",
    "moreover , even plane waves , as far as they are truly real ones , suffer from a certain superluminality .",
    "indeed , as it is well known , the most simple physically feasible realization of a plane wave beam is the gaussian beam with its constrained cross - section and , correspondingly , a finite energy flux .",
    "however , one can readily check on the analytical expressions for the beam ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) that due to the gouy phase shift the group velocity in the waist region of the gaussian beam is slightly superluminal .",
    "we are convinced that the x - type waves are not  and can not be  at variance with the special theory of relativity since they are derived as solutions to the dalambert wave equation and corresponding electromagnetic vector fields are solutions to the maxwell equations .",
    "the relativistic causality has been inherently built into them as it was demonstrated also in the present paper , when we developed the sommerfeld representation basing upon the relativistically invariant retarded and advanced green functions .",
    "an analysis of local evolution and propagation of a  signal mark  made ,",
    "e. g. by a shutter onto the x wave is not a simple task due to diffractive changes in the field behind the  mark  .",
    "therefore conclusions concerning the local causality may remain obscured .",
    "however ,  a rather straightforward geometrical analysis in the case of infinitely wideband x wave ( with the width parameter @xmath104 ) shows that the wave can not carry any causal signal between two points along its propagation axis .",
    "so , we arrive at conclusion that the x - type waves constitute one example of  allowed  but nontrivial superluminal movements . as a matter of fact ",

    "superluminal movements allowed by the relativistic causality have been studied since the middle of the previous century ( see references in  @xcite ) .",

    "we could place a real wire along the propagation axis and treat the outgoing cone of the wave as a result of cylindrical reflection of ( or of radiation by the superluminal current in the wire induced by ) the leading collapsing cone of the wave .    in conclusion , superluminal movement of individual material particles",
    "is not allowed but excitations in an ensemble may propagate with any speed , however , if the speed exceeds @xmath103 they can not transmit any physical signal .",
    "last two decades have made it profoundly clear how promising and fruitful is studying of the superluminal phenomena instead of considering them as a sort of trivialities or taboos .",
    "we have in mind here not only the localized waves or photon tunneling  or propagation in inverted resonant media , etc . , but also  or even first of all  the implementation and application of entangled states of einstein - podolsky - rozen pairs of particles in quantum telecommunication and computing .",
