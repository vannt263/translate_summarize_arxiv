    "for quite a long time physics beyond the standart model continues to be an intriguing subject .",
    "several reactions which may serve as signatures for the new physics have been discussed .",
    "one of the most elegant proposal is to look for @xmath0 oscillations @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are three possible experimental settings aimed at the observation of this process .",
    "the first one is to establish a limit on nuclear instability since @xmath2 produced inside a nucleus will blow it up .",
    "the second one is to use a neutron beam from a reactor .",
    "this beam propagates a long distance to the target in which possible @xmath2 component would annihilate and thus be detected .",
    "the third option which we discuss in the present paper is to use ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) confined in a trap .",
    "the main question is to what extent the generation of the @xmath2 component is reduced by the interaction with the trap walls .",
    "this subject was addressed by several authors @xcite . a thorough investigation of the problem is in our opinion still lacking .",
    "first of all the clear formulation of the problem of @xmath0 oscillations in a cavity has been hither to missing .",
    "two different approaches were employed without presenting sound arguments in favor of their applicability and without tracing connections between them .    in the first approach",
    "@xcite @xmath0 oscillations are considered in the basis of the discrete eigenstates of the trap potential taking into account the splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath2 levels and @xmath2 annihilation .",
    "the density of the trap eigenstates which is proportional to the macroscopic trap volume is huge and the states cluster together extremely thickly .",
    "however these arguments are not enough to discard the discrete states approach since @xmath0 mixing parameter is much smaller than the distance between adjacent levels  see below .",
    "the true reason due to which the discrete eigenstates approach is of little physical relevance is the following .",
    "the spectrum of the neutrons provided to the trap by the source is continuous and certain time is needed for the rearrangement of the initial wave function into standing waves corresponding to the trap eigenstates . as will be shown below this time interval is of the order of @xmath4-decay time so that the standing waves regime being interesting by itself can hardly be reached in the real physical situation .",
    "the second approach @xcite treats the neutrons and antineutrons inside a trap as freely moving particles which undergo reflections from the trap walls . collisions with the walls result in a reduction of the @xmath2 component compared to the case of the free - space evolution .",
    "this suppression is due to two factors .",
    "the first one is the annihilation inside the walls .",
    "the second one is the phase decoherence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 components induced by the difference of the walls potentials acting on @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "reflections of antineutrons from the trap walls were for the first time considered in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of that paper was to investigate the principal possibility to observe @xmath0 oscillations in a trap and the authors estimated reflection coefficient for antineutrons without paying attention to the decoherence phenomena . only single collision with the trap wall was considered in  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive study of @xmath0 oscillations in a trap was presented in  @xcite .",
    "decoherence and multiple reflections were included as well as the influence of the gravitational and magnetic fields .",
    "the approximate equation for the annihilation probability after @xmath5 collisions was obtained in  @xcite ( equation ( 3.8 ) ) which coincides with the exact formula ( 59 ) of the present paper when @xmath6 . as we show below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) the @xmath5-independent asymptotic regime settles at @xmath7 .",
    "the derivation of the exact equation for the annihilation probability for arbitrary number of collisions is in no way the only purpose of the present work .",
    "we already mentioned the problem of the relation between the eigenvalue and the wave packet approaches . within the wave packet approach",
    "some basic notions such as the time between successive collisions and the collision time itself can be defined in a clear and rigorous way .",
    "another question within the wave - packet formalism is the independence of the reflection coefficient on the width of the wave packet and the applicability of the stationary formalism to calculate reflections from the trap walls . these and some other principal points are considered for the first time in detail in the present paper .",
    "let us also mention that an alternative approach to the evaluation of the reflection coefficients for @xmath3 and @xmath2 was outlined in  @xcite .",
    "calculations presented there are based on the time - dependent hamilton formalism for the interaction of @xmath3 and @xmath2 with the trap walls .",
    "this subject remains outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we remind the basic equations describing @xmath0 oscillations in free space .",
    "section iii is devoted to the optical potential approach to the interaction of @xmath3 and @xmath2 with the trap walls . in section",
    "iv we analyze the two formalisms proposed to treat @xmath0 oscillations in the cavity , namely box eigenstates and wave packets . in section v the reflection from the trap walls is considered .",
    "section vi contains the main result of this work which is the time dependence of the @xmath2  component production probability . in section vii conclusions",
    "are formulated and problems to be solved outlined .",
    "we start by reminding the basic equations describing @xmath0 oscillations in free space .",
    "the phenomenological hamiltonian is a @xmath8 matrix in the basis of the two - component @xmath0 wave function ( we set @xmath9 )    @xmath10    where @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the magnetic moment , @xmath14 is the external ( e.g.  the earth ) magnetic field , @xmath15 is the @xmath4-decay width , @xmath16 is the @xmath0 mixing parameter ( see below ) , @xmath17 is the pauli matrix . assuming the @xmath3 and @xmath2 wave functions to be plane waves we write the two - component wave function of the @xmath0 system as    @xmath18    then the evolution of the time - dependent part of @xmath19 is described by the equation    @xmath20",
    "the difference between @xmath21 and @xmath22 due to the earth magnetic field is    @xmath23    diagonalizing the matrix in ( 3 ) we find @xmath24 and @xmath25 in terms of their values at @xmath26 :    @xmath27\\ ] ]    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "in particular if @xmath32 , one has    @xmath33    the use of this equation to test fundamental symmetries is discussed in @xcite .    without magnetic field ,",
    "i.e.  for @xmath34 , and for @xmath35 equation ( 7 ) yields    @xmath36    this law ( for @xmath37 ) has been employed to establish the lower limit on the oscillation time @xmath38 . according to the ill - grenoble experiment @xcite    @xmath39",
    "the corresponding value of the mixing parameter is @xmath40 .",
    "this number will be used in obtaining numerical results presented below .",
    "the earth magnetic field leads to a strong suppression of @xmath0 oscillations . with the value of @xmath41 given by ( 4 ) equation ( 7 )",
    "leads to the following result :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 .",

    "we remind that neutrons with energy @xmath47 are called ultra - cold .",
    "an excellent review of ucn physics was given by i.  m.  frank @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a useful relation connecting the neutron velocity @xmath48 in cm / s and @xmath49 in ev reads    @xmath50^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    for @xmath51 the velocity is @xmath52 .",
    "a less formal definition of ucn involves a notion of the real part of the optical potential corresponding to the trap material ( see below ) .",
    "neutrons with energies less than the height of this potential are called ultra - cold .",
    "the two definitions are essentially equivalent since as we shall see for most materials the real part of the optical potential is of the order of @xmath53 ev .    our main interest concerns strongly absorptive interaction of the @xmath2 component with the trap walls .",
    "therefore wery weak absorption of ucn on the walls @xcite will be ignored . due to complete reflection from the trap walls",
    "ucn can be stored for about @xmath1 s ( @xmath4-decay time ) as was first pointed out by ya .",
    "b.  zeldovich @xcite .    to be concrete we consider ucn with @xmath54 ev which corresponds to @xmath55 cm / s ( see ( 13 ) ) , @xmath56 ev and de broglie wave length @xmath57 cm . in the next section",
    "we shall describe ucn in terms of the wave packets and hence the above values should be attributed to the center of the packet .",
    "interaction of @xmath3 and @xmath2 with the trap walls will be treated in terms of energy - independent optical potential .",
    "the validity of this approach to ucn has been justified in a number of papers , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there is still an open question concerning the discrepancy between theoretical prediction and experimental data on ucn absorption .",
    "interesting by itself this problem is outside the scope of our work since as already mentioned absorption of neutrons may be ignored in @xmath0 oscillation process .",
    "the low - energy optical potential reads    @xmath58    where @xmath59 ; @xmath60 is the neutron mass , @xmath5 is the number of nuclei in a unit volume , @xmath61 is the @xmath62 scattering length which is real for @xmath3 and complex for @xmath2 . for neutrons",
    "the scattering lengths @xmath63 are accurately known for various materials @xcite . for antineutrons",
    "the situation is different .",
    "experimental data on low - energy @xmath64 interaction are absent .",
    "only some indirect information may be gained from level shifts in antiprotonic atoms .",
    "therefore the values of @xmath65 used in @xcite as an input in the problem of @xmath0 oscillations are similar but not the same .",
    "we consider as most reliable the set of @xmath65 calculated in @xcite within the framework of internuclear cascade model .",
    "even this particular model leads to several solutions .",
    "therefore the one we have chosen for @xmath66 ( graphite and diamond ) may be called  motivated  by ref .",
    "to get a feeling on the dependence upon the material of the walls and to compare our results with that of @xcite we also made calculations for @xmath67 . scattering lengths for @xmath67",
    "are not presented in @xcite and we used a solution proposed in @xcite .",
    "thus our calculations were performed with the following set of @xmath64 scattering lengths :    @xmath68    the scattering lengths for neutrons are @xcite : @xmath69 the concentrations of atoms @xmath5 entering into ( 14 ) are : @xmath70 , @xmath71 . then according to ( 14 ) the optical potentials read    @xmath72    @xmath73    in the present work we consider particles ( @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) with energies below the potential barrier formed by the real part of the potential . for @xmath2 and @xmath66",
    "the limiting velocity is @xmath74 cm / s .",
    "it is convenient to use for the optical potentials ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) the shorthand notation    @xmath75    where @xmath76 while the wall material is not indicated explicitly .",
    "we consider the following model for the trap in which @xmath0 oscillations may be possibly observed .",
    "imagine the two walls of the type ( 19 ) separated by a distance @xmath77 cm , i.e.  the one - dimensional potential well of the form    @xmath78    with @xmath79 being a step function .",
    "our goal is to follow the time evolution of the @xmath2 component in such a trap assuming that the initial state is a pure @xmath3 one .",
    "the first question to be answered is how to describe the wave function of the system .",
    "two different approaches seem to be feasible and both were discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "the first one is to consider oscillations occuring in the wave packet and to investigate to what extent reflections from the walls distort the picture as compared to the free - space regime .",
    "the second one is to consider eigenvalue problem in the potential well ( 20 ) , to find energy levels for @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and to consider oscillations in this basis . due to different interaction with the walls the levels of @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "are splitted and @xmath2 levels acquire annihilation widths .    at first glance",
    "this approach might seem inadequate since in a trap with @xmath77 cm the density of states is very high , the characteristic quantum number corresponding to the ucn energy is very large , the splitting @xmath80 between adjacent @xmath3-levels ( or between the levels of @xmath3 and @xmath2 spectra ) is extremely small .",
    "the values of all these quantities will be given below and we shall see that @xmath81 ev . however , this approach can not be discarded without further analysis since the @xmath0 mixing parameter @xmath82 ev is much smaller than @xmath80 .    to understand the relation between the two approaches note that the initial conditions correspond to a beam of ucn provided by a source .",
    "the momentum spectrum of ucn depends on the concrete experimental conditions . in order to stay on general grounds and at the same time to simplify the problem",
    "we shall assume that the ucn beam entering the trap has a form of a gaussian wave packet .",
    "suppose that at @xmath26 the center of the wave packet is at @xmath83 so that    @xmath84    where @xmath85 is the width of the wave packet in coordinate space .",
    "the normalization of the wave function ( 21 ) corresponds to one particle over the whole one - dimensional space :    @xmath86    for @xmath54 ev and the beam resolution @xmath87 one has    @xmath88    the width of the wave packet ( 21 ) increases with time according to    @xmath89^{1/2}\\approx t / ma\\ ] ]    and for @xmath90 s becomes comparable with the trap size @xmath91 . in order that the wave hitting the wall and the reflected one to be clearly resolved the condititon @xmath92 , or @xmath93 has to be satisfied , where @xmath94 s is the time between two consecutive collisions with the trap walls .",
    "reflection of the wave packet from the walls is considered in detail in the next section . here",
    "we will show that @xmath90 s is the characteristic time needed for the rearrangement of the initial wave packet into the stationary states of the trapping box .",
    "consider the eigenvalue problem for the potential well ( 20 ) .",
    "parameters of the potential ( 20 ) for neutrons are @xmath95 .",
    "the number of levels is    @xmath96    according to ( 23 ) the center of the wave packet ( 21 ) has a momentum @xmath56 ev which corresponds to a state with a number of nodes @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "positions of such highly excited levels in a finite depth potential are indistinguishable from the spectrum in a potential box with infinite walls .",
    "thus    @xmath99    the wave functions ( 26 ) describe semi - classical states with @xmath100 in a potential well with sharp edges .",
    "the  frequency ",
    "@xmath101 is very high as compared to the width of the wave packet in momentum space , @xmath102 .",
    "this means that the wave packet spans over a large number of levels . to determine this number note that the distance between adjacent levels around the center of the wave packet is @xmath103 ev . the highly excited levels within the energy band @xmath104 ev corresponding to the wave packet ( 21 ) are to a high accuracy equidistant as it should be in a semi - classical regime .",
    "the number of states within @xmath105 is @xmath106 and their density in momentum space is    @xmath107    now we can answer the question formulated at the beginning of this section , namely whether one should describe @xmath0 oscillations in the trap in terms of the wave packet or in terms of the stationary eigenfunctions . at @xmath26 the wave function has the form of the wave packet ( 21 ) provided by the ucn source . due to collisions with the trap walls transitions from the initial state ( 21 ) into discrete ( or quasi - discrete for @xmath2 ) eigenstates ( 26 ) take place .",
    "the time - evolution of the initial wave function ( 21 ) proceeds according to    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the time - dependent green s function for the potential well ( 20 ) . making use of the spectral representation for @xmath110 , one can write    @xmath111    in semi - classical approximation the distance between the adjacent levels is @xmath112",
    ". therefore one may think that at @xmath113 , i.e.  already at the first collision the neighboring terms in ( 29 ) would cancel each other .",
    "however this is not the case .",
    "indeed , @xmath114.\\nonumber\\ ] ] therefore at @xmath115 there is a constructive interference either in the first or in the second terms correspondingly .",
    "this holds true with the account of the whole sum of terms in ( 29 ) and hence one can pass from summation to integration in ( 29 ) . the wave function overlap",
    "entering into ( 29 ) can be easily evaluated provided the center of the wave packet @xmath116 is not within the bandwidth distance @xmath117 from the trap walls .",
    "the overlap is given by the following integral :    @xmath118    at this step we have omitted the exponent with high frequency @xmath119 .",
    "next take @xmath120 as a new variable and resort to the assumption @xmath121 ( we remind that @xmath116 is negative since @xmath122 ) .",
    "the result reads    @xmath123    corrections to ( 31 ) are of order of @xmath124 .",
    "now comes frequency summation in ( 29 ) .",
    "this summation can be substituted by integration over @xmath41 since the density of semi - classical states @xmath125 is very high . in this way",
    "we arrive at    @xmath126^{1/2}}\\biggl(\\exp[-\\frac{\\alpha(x , t)}{2a^2(1+\\frac{t^2}{m^2a^4 } ) } ] + \\exp[-\\frac{\\alpha(-x , t)}{2a^2(1+\\frac{t^2}{m^2a^4})}]\\biggl),\\ ] ]    @xmath127    the second term in ( 32 ) describes the reflected wave packet  see the next section . according to ( 21 ) , ( 28 ) and ( 32 ) all that happens to the wave packet in the trap is broadening and reflections .",
    "this is true at least during some initial period of its life history .",
    "how long does this period last ?",
    "the answer to this question may be obtained estimating the accuracy of performing frequency integration instead of summation over discrete states in ( 29 ) .    to estimate the time scale for the rearrangement of the initial wave packet ( 21 ) into the trap standing waves ( 26 ) , it is convenient to introduce the difference @xmath128 between the  exact  wave function ( 29 ) and the approximate integral representation ( 32 ) .",
    "as soon as    @xmath129    one can consider oscillations as proceeding in the wave packet basis .",
    "the following estimate holds    @xmath130    here @xmath131    from ( 36 ) one gets @xmath132 since @xmath133 is a narrow gaussian peak , we can substiute @xmath134 by @xmath135 , and then ( 35 ) results in    @xmath136    from ( 34 ) and ( 38 ) , we get    @xmath137    where @xmath117 is given by ( 23 ) .    roughly speaking , the time @xmath90 s needed for the neutron wave function to rearrange into the trap eigenstate is comparable to the neutron life - time and neutron would rather  die  than adjust to the new boundary conditions .",
    "therefore in what follows the wave packet formalism will be used .",
    "some additional subtleties arising from the quantization of the levels in the trapping box will be discussed in section vii .",
    "consider again a one - dimensional trap ( 20 ) .",
    "let the particle moving from @xmath138 enter the trap at @xmath26 through the window at @xmath139 .",
    "at @xmath113 it will reach the wall at @xmath140 , the @xmath3 component will be reflected from the wall while the @xmath2 component will be partly reflected and partly absorbed .",
    "the wave packet describing the interaction with the wall has the form    @xmath141    where @xmath76 and    @xmath142    for the @xmath3 component @xmath143 since we neglect very weak absorption of neutrons at the surface .",
    "the integral ( 40 ) with the first term of ( 41 ) is trivial . in order to integrate the second term of ( 41 ) note that due to the gaussian form - factor with @xmath144 the dominant contribution to",
    "the integral ( 40 ) comes from the narrow interval of @xmath145 around @xmath146 .",
    "expanding @xmath147 at @xmath148 and keeping the leading term we get    @xmath149\\\\ \\simeq\\rho_j(k_0)e^{i\\phi_j(k_0)+i\\phi_j^\\prime(k_0)(k - k_0)}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the validity of the last step for @xmath2 will become clear from the explicit expression for @xmath150 and @xmath151 presented below .",
    "now integration in ( 40 ) can be easily performed with the result @xcite    @xmath152^{1/2}}\\biggl(\\exp[-\\frac{\\alpha_{inc}(x , t)}{2a^2(1+\\frac{t^2}{m^2a^4})}]+ r_j(k_0)\\exp[-\\frac{\\alpha_{refl}(x , t)}{2a^2(1+\\frac{t^2}{m^2a^4})}]\\biggl),\\ ] ]    @xmath153    @xmath154    from ( 43)(45 ) we see that the essence of @xmath155 in the wave packet formalism is the same as in the time independent approach . therefore imposing standard boundary conditions at @xmath140",
    "we get the reflection coefficients    @xmath156    @xmath157^{1/2},\\\\ \\kappa_{\\bar n}=[2m(v_{\\bar n}-iw_{\\bar n}-e)]^{1/2}=\\kappa^\\prime_{\\bar n}-i\\kappa^{\\prime\\prime}_{\\bar n } , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    @xmath158    @xmath159    in particular for @xmath160 ( graphite ) @xmath161    the first term in the right - hand side of ( 45 ) may be written as @xmath162 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "hence the collision time or time - delay is @xcite    @xmath163    for neutrons , i.e.  for real @xmath164 , equation ( 51 ) gives the well - known result @xmath165^{-1/2}$ ] .",

    "imagine an observer placed at a bandwidth distance from the wall , i.e.  at @xmath169 . according to ( 43)(45 )",
    "such an observer will conclude that at times @xmath170 the incident wave ( the first term in ( 43 ) ) dominates , while at @xmath171 the reflected wave prevails .",
    "with this splitting of the time interval around @xmath172 in mind we shall use the notations @xmath173 and @xmath174 for the moments before and after the @xmath175 collision .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath2 production rate since we have a rigorous definitions of the collision time and the time interval between the two subsequent collisions .",
    "now we can inquire into the problem of the time - dependence of @xmath2 production probability . in free space",

    "difference in collision times ( 52 ) for @xmath3 and @xmath2 may be ignored as well . in the previous section",

    "after crossing the trap , i.e.  at @xmath180 , the time - dependent parts of the wave functions are given by ( 12 ) [ we state this because although the gaussian form factor in ( 43 ) also depends on time , the corresponding terms in the time - dependent shrdinger equation are of order of @xmath181 as compared to the derivative of the exponent @xmath182 ; also note that the form factors are the same for @xmath3 and @xmath2 up to constant multiplier ] :    @xmath183 . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    after the first reflection at @xmath184 we get    @xmath185,\\\\ \\psi_{\\bar n}(\\tau_l+)=\\rho_{\\bar n}\\sin(\\epsilon \\tau_l)\\exp[-i(e\\tau_l-\\phi_{\\bar n}+\\pi/2 ) ] .",

    "this figure shows what can be expected from the trap experiments in the most favorable though hardly realistic scenario .",
    "we have reexamined the problem of @xmath0 oscillations for ucn in a trap . our aim was to present a clear formulation of the problem , to calculate the amplitude of the @xmath2 component for arbitrary observation time and for any given reflection properties of the trap walls .",
    "we have shown that for physically relevant observation time ( i.e.  for the time interval less than @xmath4-decay time ) the process of @xmath0 oscillations is described in terms of the wave packets while the standing waves regime may settle only at later times . by calculating the difference between @xmath3 and @xmath2 collision times the new light has been shed on the decoherence phenomena .",
    "for the first time an exact equation has been derived for the annihilation probability for an arbitrary number of collisions with the trap walls . in line with the conclusions of the previous authors on the subject",
    "this probability grows linearly with time .",
    "we have calculated the enhancement factor entering into this linear time dependence and found this factor to be @xmath215 depending on the reflection properties of the wall material .    despite the extensive investigations reviewed in this article and the results of the present paper the list of problems for further",
    "work is large .",
    "the central and most difficult task is to obtain reliable parameters of the optical potential for antineutrons",
    ". the beam of @xmath2 with energy in the range of @xmath220 will be hardly accessible in the near future .",
    "therefore work has to be continued along the two lines mentioned above  to deduce the parameters of the optical potential from the level shifts in antiprotonic atoms and to construct reliable optical models which can be confronted with the available experimental data on @xmath2-nuclear interaction at higher energies . in the forthcoming publication",
    "we plan to present numerical calculation of the time evolution of the wave packet into standing waves as well as to discuss some features of @xmath0 oscillations in the eigenfunctions basis which were not discussed in ref .",
    "another task is to perform calculation for the concrete geometry of the trap an realistic spectrum of the neutron beam . to this end",
    "one needs an input corresponding to a concrete experimental setting .",
