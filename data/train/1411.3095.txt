    "<S> laser cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators is of great interest for both fundamental studies and practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a general framework to describe the cavity - assisted backaction cooling in the strong coupling regime . by studying the cooling dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the temporal evolution of mean phonon number oscillates as a function of the optomechanical coupling strength depending on frequency mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the further analytical result reveals that the optimal cooling limit is obtained when the system eigenmodes satisfy the frequency matching condition . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced instantaneous - state cooling limits with dynamic dissipative cooling approach are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> our study provides a guideline for optimizing the backaction cooling of mesoscopic mechanical resonators in the strong coupling regime . </S>"
