    "significant progress has been recently achieved in the modelling of galaxy formation and evolution through the development of the so  called `` _ ab initio _ semi  analytic models '' in which the astrophysics of gas collapse , star formation / evolution and stellar feedback can be explicitly implemented in the hierarchical clustering paradigm ( white @xmath5 frenk 1991 ; lacey @xmath5 silk 1991 ; lacey _ et al .",

    "_ 1996a , b , 1997 ; somerville @xmath5 primack 1998 ) .",
    "these models have been successfully applied to the prediction of the statistical properties of galaxies in the uv , visible and nir emitted by stars , and , very recently , in the fir emitted by dust ( guiderdoni _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . in spite of differences in the details ,",
    "these studies lead to conclusions which are remarkably similar .",
    "however , very little theoretical work has been done so far to implement observational biases in theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution . among the various possibilities ,",
    "surface brightness limits are surely the most important bias , and this is why a detailed study of this specific effect in the framework of semi ",
    "analytic models is highly desirable .",
    "namely , one would expect that introducing a surface brightness threshold into the calculation would drastically change the predictions issued for the luminosity functions .    as a matter of fact",
    ", this kind of improvement seems to be necessary to solve the issue of the luminosity function .",
    "all the observational works concerning field galaxies give luminosity function slopes that are clearly less steep than the predicted value @xmath6 , although this latter slope already takes into account the astrophysics of star formation / evolution and is significantly shallower than the underlying halo mass distribution with @xmath7 .",
    "two different explanations have thus been put forward to account for this mismatch , namely , merging of galaxies or failure of detection due to surface brightness limitations .",
    "\\(1 ) merging of galaxies .",
    "merging could reduce the number of objects in the local universe .",
    "this hypothesis has been modelled and tested by kauffmann _",
    "( 1993 , 1994 ) , cole _",
    "( 1994 ) , somerville @xmath5 primack ( 1998 ) , and other papers in these series .",
    "the results seem to indicate that the merging rate is relatively small and that mass and luminosity functions issued from these models are not significantly different from those computed with less elaborate formalisms .",
    "\\(2 ) failure of detection due to surface brightness limitations .",
    "observational selection effects would provide a simple explanation that could interplay with the strong intrinsic dimming of some galaxies along their lives ( see _ e.g. _ mcgaugh 1994 ; schade @xmath5 ferguson 1994 ; phillipps @xmath5 driver 1995 ; driver @xmath5 phillipps 1996 ; bothun , impey @xmath5 mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "for instance , a strong episode of star formation followed by mass loss due to supernova  driven winds and the aging of the remaining stellar population would cause this dimming and could even eventually lead to the extreme case of gravitational disruption , especially for dwarf or extended galaxies , where the potential well is shallower ( broadhurst _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 , lacey @xmath5 silk 1991 , cowie _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , babul @xmath5 rees 1992 ) .",
    "this kind of scenarios would also provide a plausible explanation for the differences between field and cluster galaxy luminosity functions , these latter ones showing typically steeper faint - end slopes . as suggested by _",
    "e.g. _ babul @xmath5 rees ( 1992 ) , mass loss suffered by galaxies within clusters is actually minimized thanks to the confinement provided by the surrounding intra - cluster gas .",
    "in fact , while steep slopes @xmath8 of luminosity functions have lately begun to be unveiled by new observations of clusters ( _ e.g. _ driver _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; de propris _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ; lobo _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; wilson _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; trentham 1997a , b , 1998a , b ) , it is not clear yet whether field galaxy luminosity functions in the local universe follow the same trend .",
    "this is because faint and diffuse objects are marginally detected in the standard spectroscopic surveys of field galaxies and , for those that are flagged , the signal - to - noise ratio is often quite weak .",
    "the nature of these galaxies that fail to be detected by local field surveys is extensively discussed in recent literature ( see _ e.g. _ mcgaugh 1995 ; bothun , impey @xmath5 mcgaugh 1997 ) and they span a large range in mass  : from low - mass faint dwarfs till the most massive , low surface brightness , blue disks ( _ e.g. _ malin  1  ; bothun _ et al . _ 1987 ) .",
    "these objects do exist in large numbers , even though they contribute somewhat modestly ( by 10 to 30@xmath9 ) to the total integrated luminosity ( mcgaugh @xmath5 bothun 1994 , impey _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "thus , systematic errors undoubtedly affect the field luminosity functions that have been published up to now , since none of them has had a completeness correction to account for this bias ( impey _ et al . _ 1996 ) .",
    "once the surface brightness selection effects are taken into account , the faint slope of the observed local field luminosity function is bound to suffer a considerable change ( mcgaugh _ et al .",
    "computations by driver @xmath5 phillipps ( 1996 ) predict an upturn in the luminosity function at @xmath10@xmath11  @xmath12  @xmath1318   km  s@xmath14mpc@xmath14 .",

    "the works of sprayberry _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) and loveday ( 1997 ) also seem to indicate that the local field luminosity function definitely contains more faint members than had been detected up to recently by _ e.g. _ loveday _ et al . _",

    "it would thus seem that a fading scenario is the most promising approach to tackle the disagreement between theories and observations . in the following ,",
    "we revisit this problem and analyze the effects of observational biases by comparing the results of galaxy modelling and observations . more specifically , by adopting a scenario of surface brightness dimming , we aim at quantifying the influence of pre  determined surface brightness thresholds on the slope of the multi ",
    "wavelength luminosity function of field galaxies .",
    "this issue leads us immediately to consider the delicate modelling of mass loss due to supernova  driven winds .",
    "all semi  analytic models use the same ideas to implement this process , originating in the pioneer paper by dekel & silk ( 1986 ) .",
    "type ii / ib supernovae eject kinetic and thermal energy in the interstellar medium .",
    "only a fraction @xmath0 effectively heats up the gas .",
    "when the thermal velocity of the gas reaches the escape velocity @xmath15 , the interstellar medium is lost through galactic winds , and star formation is quenched .",
    "the first problem with this standard modelling is that the process depends on the depth of the potential well . in principle , the latter is computable e.g. in cdm cosmologies .",
    "but the question is whether the theoretical density profiles actually reproduce the true density profiles of haloes .",
    "second , radiative losses are important and , consequently , the efficiency @xmath0 should be weak ( thornton _ et al . _ 1998 ) .",
    "finally , this model does not describe what actually occurs in disk galaxies : when the expanding shell reaches the edge of the disk along the @xmath16axis perpendicular to the plane , it simply blows its hot gas out , with little effect on the cold gas of the disk . as a matter of fact , energetic outflows observed in irregular galaxies seem to blow out only a small fraction of the insterstellar medium ( martin 1996 ) .    when a surface ",
    "brightness criterion is taken into account , the strong uncertainty in the modelling of supernova feedback appears more clearly .",
    "then we can test the robustness of the results at the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "hereafter , we take the standard model which is used by all authors of semi  analytic models ( see the above  mentionned references ) , and we show how the efficiency parameter @xmath0 ( taken as a `` fudge factor '' ) influences the results . of course , a still larger uncertainty in the model ( which appears plausible ) would affect the results to a larger extent .    to achieve this heuristic work",
    ", we do not need a complicated cosmological model .",
    "we hereafter use a simple version of a semi  analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution , with standard cdm ( the most classical case ) .",
    "the layout of this paper is the following  : in section  [ modelo ] we rapidly describe the model , emphasizing the new components we introduce with this work .",
    "these determine the behavior of the output quantities relatively to the star formation histories , wind efficiency and surface brightness thresholds , as discussed in section  [ fit_parametros ] .",
    "synthetic luminosity functions are compared with observational data for redshift @xmath17 in section  [ funcoes_luminosidade ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusoes ] , we discuss the results and present our conclusions . in particular , the shape of the luminosity function provides us with a powerful tool for emphasizing the strong influence of supernova feedback on the detection of faint galaxies when surface brightness criteria are taken into account .",
    "we use a simple version of a semi  analytic model of formation and evolution of galaxies , to which we add some original ingredients which are relevant for our study . in this section",
    "we will sketch an overview of the underlying model , leaving the detailed descriptions for the new modules introduced by this work .",
    "we adopt the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) scenario  namely , a density parameter @xmath18 , a baryon fraction @xmath19 , a cosmological constant @xmath20 , a hubble constant @xmath21 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , and a normalization for the power spectrum of linear fluctuations that is given by the inverse of the linear bias parameter @xmath22  and we focus on the astrophysics of galaxy evolution .",
    "the influence of the cosmological parameters on the predictions of semi - analytic models is studied by _",
    "e.g. _ heyl _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) and somerville @xmath5 primack ( 1998 ) , and turns out to be smaller than the uncertainties due to the free parameters of the dissipative astrophysics ( mainly star formation and stellar feedback ) .      simplifying assumptions",
    "need to be made in a semi  analytic formalism .",
    "in particular , the initial linear density perturbation is assumed to be spherical and homogeneous .",
    "this is the so  called `` top  hat '' model , which can be entirely defined by two parameters  : the size @xmath23 and density contrast @xmath24 , which are the linearly  extrapolated values at @xmath25 , or , equivalently , by the mass @xmath26 and collapse redshift @xmath27 .",
    "if @xmath28 is the current mass density of the universe , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "the perturbation thus generated grows , reaches turnaround radius , decouples from the expansion of the universe and collapses to form a spherical , virialized halo truncated at `` virial radius '' @xmath32 .",
    "the properties of the virialized halo are entirely computable as functions of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hereafter we adopt the universal density profile proposed by navarro , frenk @xmath5 white ( 1997 , hereafter nfw ) instead of the @xmath33 `` isothermal '' profile , since the former is now used by the most recent versions of the semi  analytic models .",
    "our purpose is to show the uncertainties in the standard situation , rather than to address the issue of the `` true '' density profile .",
    "anyhow , we checked that the use of `` isothermal '' profiles would not change our conclusions qualitatively . in the nfw model ,",
    "the density profile of the relaxed halo at @xmath34 is  :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is a scale radius , and @xmath37 is the critical density for closure . the characteristic density @xmath38 is computed by :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is computed according to the procedure described in navarro , frenk @xmath5 white ( 1997 ) with f@xmath410.01 .",
    "the `` concentration '' of a halo , @xmath42 , is linked to the characteristic density @xmath38 by means of the definition of the virial radius so that  :    @xmath43}\\ ] ]    this implies that the `` circular velocity '' at radius @xmath2 is given by  :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the velocity at the virial radius , and @xmath46 is the radius in units of virial radius .",
    "the number density of halos that collapse at a given redshift / time and with a given mass is easily determined from a simple press ",
    "schechter ( ps ) prescription ( press @xmath5 schechter 1974 ) .",
    "@xmath47    if the power spectrum can be approximated by a power law @xmath48 , the low  mass end is @xmath49 .",
    "the cdm spectral index varies between @xmath50 and 1 , yielding a slope @xmath51 to @xmath52 , close to @xmath53 on galaxy scales .",
    "we intend hereafter to use a simple prescription and focus on the astrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this will make the comparison with previous papers easier . in order to implement the simpler ps formalism",
    ", crude assumptions must be done . as a matter of fact",
    ", we need the formation rate of haloes versus time or redshift , while the time derivative of the ps number density only gives the net creation rate of haloes with mass @xmath26  :    @xmath54    the first term of the right  hand part of the equation describes the formation of haloes with mass @xmath26 from haloes with masses @xmath55 , while the second term describes the destruction rate to haloes with masses @xmath56 . for a given mass ,",
    "the formation rate first dominates ( @xmath57 ) , then the destruction rate dominates ( @xmath58 ) . as _",
    "e.g. _ in haehnelt @xmath5 rees ( 1993 ) , we chose to take @xmath59 in the first case ( destruction is neglected ) , and 0 in the second case ( formation is neglected ) , to estimate the space density of newly formed haloes .",
    "this crude assumption leads to neglecting the effect of galaxy merging which anyway seems to be weak .",
    "hierarchical theories of structure formation require a feedback mechanism in order to prevent most of the material from collapsing into sub - galactic objects at high redshifts ( _ e.g. _ efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "so , we introduce a cut  off at low circular velocities and high redshifts preventing gas cooling if @xmath60 km s@xmath14 and @xmath61 . as shown by kauffmann _",
    "( 1993 ) , this does not alleviate the problem of the dwarfs .",
    "the previously shock  heated baryon component starts cooling down in the potential wells of dark matter haloes and collapses into disks .",
    "the cooling time at a given halo radius is computed according to fall @xmath5 rees ( 1985 ) and leads to the definition of a cooling radius ( @xmath62 ) as a function of redshift . at this redshift ,",
    "only gas inside the cooling radius ( or the virial radius , in case the latter is smaller ) cools and is available for star formation .",
    "normally , the cooling process depends on gas metallicity but here we do not take this dependence into account , and we shall only consider the solar metallicity case . if we assume angular momentum conservation , then the collapse of the baryonic matter stops when rotational equilibrium is reached . an exponential disk forms . to determine the final radius of the disk relatively to the initial radius of the halo , we apply the formalism proposed by fall @xmath5 efstathiou ( 1980 ) , and mo , mao @xmath5 white ( 1998 ) , under the standard assumption that the disk and halo share the same specific angular momentum , even though numerical simulations ( navarro @xmath5 white 1994 , navarro @xmath5 steinmetz 1997 ) seem to hint that this may be too crude .",
    "the typical length scale @xmath63 for the exponential disk is , again following mo , mao @xmath5 white ( 1998 )  :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is a function of the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath66 , the halo concentration factor @xmath67 , and the fraction @xmath68 of the halo mass that settles into the disk .",
    "a sufficiently accurate approximation ( mo , mao @xmath5 white 1998 ) to @xmath65 is  :    @xmath69    we note that only disks and dwarfs can form in this formalism .",
    "as we previously mentioned in section  [ introducao ] , the formation of elliptical galaxies ( and of bulges of spiral galaxies ) has to be explained by the merging of disks .",
    "( 1994 ) and cole _",
    "( 1994 ) showed that this merging process can easily explain the current fraction of giant ellipticals among bright galaxies ( about 10 % ) .",
    "stars begin to form with the gas available inside the cooling ( or the virial ) radius according to a given star formation rate @xmath70 . here",
    "we shall consider a simple case of direct proportionality to the gas surface density @xmath71 , which seems to be supported by the latest observational evidence ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",

    "the mechanism of star formation itself is regulated by feedback due to the explosion of massive stars .",
    "the standard modelling of feedback due to supernovae in semi  analytic models of galaxy formation is the following : supernova  driven winds expel gas from the galaxy and , as a consequence , less star formation occurs ( larson 1974 , dekel @xmath5 silk 1986 , bressan _ et al .",

    "the type ii / ib supernovae formation rate @xmath95 is computed from the star formation rate history .",
    "all models deliberately neglect the contribution from type ia .",

    "numerical simulations ( thornton _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) seem to privilege @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , the efficiency parameter could be still smaller in disk galaxies because of the geometry that allows supernova bubbles to blow out . in section  [ fit_parametros_epsilon ]",
    "we will analyze and discuss the behavior of our model with this parameter which is always used as a `` fudge factor '' .",
    "when a galaxy loses mass , this process can occur either impulsively - when the material is ejected within a time scale that is short compared to the dynamical time of the system  , or adiabatically  when mass loss proceeds gradually . in our models we have chosen to consider the first approach only , which seems the most realistic .",
    "this implies that the velocities of the stars are not affected during the whole process and their velocity dispersion immediately after the ( impulsive ) mass loss is the same as it was before .",
    "a straightforward consequence of mass loss is a shallowing of the system s potential .",
    "stars will start describing larger orbits .",
    "this translates into a radial expansion of the stellar material of the disk , that we treat here according to hills ( 1980 ) .",
    "note that this extension of the galactic radius is crucial for surface brightness considerations as it leads to surface brightness dimming . the final radius of the stellar material , which will allow us to determine the surface brightness of each galaxy after mass loss , is related to the initial radius by equation  :    @xmath98}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath99 subscript stands for initial values and @xmath65 for final ones , after mass loss has occurred .",
    "all variables of this equation have been defined at half  mass radius , and @xmath100 refers to the initial stellar radius obtained from the halo radius by means of the ( dimensionless ) spin parameter ( see equations  [ eq : rdisk ] and  [ eq : erre0 ] ) .",
    "finally , we shall introduce both a flux limit and a surface ",
    "brightness threshold that simulate observational limits and we analyze the behavior and sensitivity of our model predictions to these effects ( section  [ funcoes_luminosidade ] ) . in fact , it is often the case that the isophote taken to compute the surface brightness limit of a given survey may ( 1 ) differ slightly from galaxy to galaxy ( if it depends on the magnitude or the size of the object ) ; ( 2 ) depend on selection criteria ( if the filter used for target selection is not the same as the one used to compute the luminosity function ) ; ( 3 ) vary for different images of one same field taken in different nights and/or under different observational conditions .",
    "these effects can lead to differences of up to 1 magnitude ( e. bertin , private communication ) . as a reasonably fair approximation , the surface ",
    "brightness limit imposed in our models is computed at the effective radius @xmath101 .",
    "of course , surface ",
    "brighness effects are likely to be more subtle than a simple surface  brightness `` cut  off '' .",
    "but little more can be done from the description of the observations provided in the literature .",
    "we present in this section some of the results of the model described above for output redshift @xmath25 , while emphasizing the surface brightness effects that we want to explore ( presented in section  [ introducao ] ) .",
    "one could represent these results by a mean value plus @xmath102 `` error bars '' but , because of the non gaussianity of the distributions , this would be somewhat misleading .",
    "so , we preferred to draw monte  carlo realizations of the model . thus , in the set of figures that follow , we represent a given number of objects ( realizations ) , separating them accordingly to a magnitude and surface brightness criterion established by observational limits .    both classes of objects are represented in equal numbers ( e.g. 200 of each ) . unless stated otherwise ,",

    "driven winds occurs , subsequent radial expansion naturally causes dimming .",
    "the objects that undergo larger radial expansion and higher mass loss are mainly the `` dwarfs '' ( with small size and mass )",
    ". however , there is also a fraction of galaxies with higher masses that become `` invisible '' ( through a significant radial expansion ) .",
    "these could be the `` malin  1 type '' extended disks with faint surface brightnesses that we were referring to previously .",
    "note that if we were to enhance the strength and frequency of winds ( by adopting higher @xmath0 values ) during a galaxy s lifetime , the radial expansion would be more pronounced and final radii could reach up to 20 kpc .",

    "figure  [ fig : epocas ] shows different time scales against both halo mass and blue luminosity . in general , there does seem to be a value of the halo mass that acts as a limit for `` visibility ''  : low - mass objects ( say below @xmath109 @xmath83 ) are not bright enough ( in magnitude nor in surface brightness ) to be ",

    "but , in spite of these shortcomings , we do seem to manage to obtain a generally good relation between the dynamics and the photometry , as is patent in this ensemble of figures  : we have the correct galactic luminosities inside the halos , and these galaxies have the correct size ( radii ) .",
    "this last point is crucial for surface brightness considerations once we discuss the predictions for the luminosity functions .",
    "the roberts time ( kennicutt _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) gives an indication of the future star formation time scale of a galaxy at time @xmath125  :    @xmath126    @xmath127 here is either given by equation  [ eq : sfr ] ( with @xmath128 ) or null if the toomre instability criterium ( toomre 1964 ) is not verified , that is , if the gas surface density does not overcome @xmath72 ( see section  [ modelo_starform ] ) .",
    "we thus computed the roberts time for a set of model galaxies and compared its distribution with that observed by kennicutt _",
    "( 1994 ) for a sample of about 60 disk galaxies .",
    "the value of the @xmath0 parameter was left constant at 0.1 , as a result from section  [ fit_parametros_epsilon ] .",
    "this procedure provided us with the best value for the constant @xmath78 , which we finally fixed at 400  see figure  [ fig : allrobertstime ] . because we do not know the surface brightness threshold for the kennicutt _",
    "data , we can not determine a unique possibility for the fit , and consequently for @xmath78 .",
    "but the degeneracy thus created is not limitating , as is illustrated in each panel of figure  [ fig : allrobertstime]a , where different realizations of the model for different surface brightness thresholds  but the same value for @xmath78  are compared to the observed data .",
    "the distribution of roberts times does not seem to depend too much on the surface brightness threshold .",
    "the kennicutt _",
    "limit in surface brightness seems to lie around 20 @xmath13 22 @xmath129  mag arcsec@xmath104 , as estimated for @xmath78 = 400 .",
    "galaxy luminosities computed with the model allow us to build synthetic luminosity functions at low redshift and in different photometric bands .",
    "these will be compared with observational results in this section .      in figure",
    "[ fig : difsblim ] , the normalized luminosity function per mpc@xmath130 and per magnitude interval , as issued by the model , is compared with observations for field and cluster galaxies .",
    "we assume that all objects fainter than a given surface brightness detection limit will not be observed .",
    "the figure shows that , for bright galaxies , this threshold is not constraining , as one would expect , but the faint part of the luminosity function is significantly modified for different surface brightness limits .",
    "this change is translated into a flattening of the histogram that gets more pronounced as the critical threshold gets more severe .",
    "data points from loveday _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) are also displayed in the same figure for comparison .",
    "it is well  known that , with the standard cdm model , the simultaneous fit of the tully  fisher relation and luminosity function is difficult , because there are too many haloes ( see e.g. kauffmann _ et al .",
    "this is still true when surface ",
    "brightness effects are taken into account , with the crude modelling of supernova feedback .",
    "even if the @xmath121 model , which is already inconsistent with tf , accompanies best the part of the observational data around @xmath10@xmath131 ( panel a ) , it fails to reproduce the faint end slope with the surface brightness limit reported by loveday and collaborators for their survey ( around 24.5 @xmath129 mag arcsec@xmath104 ) .",
    "setting @xmath106 allows a much better description for the `` dwarf '' population as figure  [ fig : difsblim]b reveals . as a matter of fact , results are highly sensitive to the value of @xmath0 and this work might hint that @xmath0 changes along the luminosity sequence , but this simply illustrates that modelling galactic winds is quite a complex task , not yet fully accomplished with a single free parameter . still , we shall consider that @xmath106 gives a very reasonable and general representation of the faint end of field galaxy luminosity functions .    figure  [ fig : difsblim ] also shows the slope @xmath132 of the coma cluster luminosity function as determined by lobo _",
    "( 1997 ) in the v band up to magnitude @xmath10@xmath133 with limiting central surface brightness estimated as @xmath134 mag arcsec@xmath104 .",
    "note that , if we take @xmath135 as a mean colour index for coma galaxies ( mainly ellipticals ) , and the simple relation connecting the surface brightness at effective radius to the central surface value , that is @xmath136 , we get @xmath137 mag arcsec@xmath104 for the practical threshold .",
    "the normalisation for the coma data is arbitrary .",
    "it is true that we can only take this slope as indicative , as it was determined in a different waveband .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity of it with the shape of the @xmath138 mag arcsec@xmath104 model histogram is quite striking , for @xmath121 as well as @xmath106 .      given all these considerations , we will henceforth fix the @xmath0 parameter to 0.8 , to reproduce the faint ",
    "end of the luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig:4fdls ] gives the model results convolved with four different filters .",
    "for each simulation we have applied flux and surface brightness limits corresponding to what was indicated by the authors of the respective observations .",
    "thus , we have adopted the following thresholds  : @xmath10@xmath140 and @xmath103 mag arcsec@xmath104 for loveday _ et al . _",
    "( 1992 ) at @xmath17 ; @xmath141 @xmath10@xmath142 and @xmath143 for the deeper observations of sprayberry _ et al . _",
    "( 1997 ) , still in a blue waveband and at @xmath17 ; @xmath10@xmath144 and @xmath145 mag arcsec@xmath104 for the k - band survey ( selected in i ) of gardner _",
    "( 1997 ) at mean redshift @xmath146 ; and @xmath10@xmath147 and @xmath148 mag arcsec@xmath104 for the lin _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) @xmath149-type filter at mean redshift @xmath150 .",
    "do notice that these values are indicative and a margin of @xmath151 mag arcsec@xmath104 is allowed by the robustness of our models , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : difsblim ] .",
    "this should give us some margin to deal with uncertainties in the values estimated by the authors and with our choice of approximating the threshold to the value at effective radius .",
    "in each case , simulations were performed as many times as necessary to draw the same number of `` observable '' galaxies as the one reported by the respective surveys ( 1769 galaxies for loveday _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ; 693 galaxies for sprayberry _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; 510 galaxies for gardner _",
    "_ 1997 ; and 18678 for the las campanas survey of lin _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) . in doing so",
    ", we get poisson scatters combined with intrinsic features of the luminosity functions that compare to the observational features and error bars .",
    "the overall match at the faint end between data and simulations taking into account observational biases is quite remarkable , given the crudeness of our assumptions in this heuristic model .",
    "the rough consistency obtained for different wavebands probably unveils the presence of the same underlying galaxy population , despite the fact that different filters preferentially sample different stellar populations .",
    "this heuristic work shows how observational selection effects  especially surface brightness thresholds that are mainly present in field surveys",
    " could affect the predictions of semi",
    " analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , we illustrate the importance of these biases in the determination of the tf relation and luminosity functions , and we confirm that they do seem to contribute to the apparent mismatch between current models of galaxy formation and a host of observations .    with our simple model , we show that , while the star formation efficiency parameter @xmath78 can be fixed in a robust way , that is , independently of the adopted surface brightness limit , the same is no longer true for the wind efficiency parameter @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we have shown the strong sensitivity of the results to the unknown galactic wind intensity . once we adopt the standard one  parameter model for the feedback , we find that this parameter is likely to vary along the luminosity sequence . as a first guess , we suggest taking @xmath152 for bright disks ( according to the tf results , and loose theoretical considerations ) and @xmath106 to match the faint end of the luminosity functions , that is , for field `` dwarfs '' and for the faint galaxy population , both in the field as well as in clusters . further research needs to be done in order to reach a more refined description of this mechanism and improve theoretical models , especially in their interplay with surface brightness effects . in particular , simulations of observations are necessary to take into account the effects of surface brightness that are more subtle than a simple  cut ",
    "off.    the main point of the paper is the following  : the standard modelling of supernova feedback via mass loss due to galactic winds is highly uncertain .",
    "taking into account surface ",
    "brightness effects in a simple way already reveals the strong sensitivity of the results to the feedback .",
    "still , the results are in reasonable agreement with the observations , the crude fit of the data with this type of theoretical luminosity functions  at different surface brightness thresholds and at different wavelengths  in spite of the uncertainties of the model , appears rather puzzling .",
    "it suggests that the discrepant waveband luminosity functions probably unveil the same underlying galaxy population .",
    "clearly more work has to be dedicated to this issue .",
    "a realistic feedback theory is still needed for a robust modelling of faint galaxies in the semi  analytic approach . in any case , the introduction of surface ",
    "brightness biases into theoretical predictions , and more specifically into the fashionable semi  analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution , is highly desirable , no less than is the careful estimate and description of the actual surface brightness threshold by observers .",
