    "the phenomenology of compact stars is intimately connected to the eos of matter at densities well beyond the nuclear saturation density , @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "compact stars are therefore natural laboratories for the exploration of baryonic matter under extreme conditions , complementary to those created in terrestrial experiments with atomic nuclei and heavy - ion collisions .",
    "recent results derived from observations of compact stars provide serious constraints on the nuclear eos , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a stiff eos at high density is needed to explain the high compact - star masses , @xmath6  m@xmath3 , reported for some low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , _",
    "e.g. _ , 4u 1636 - 536 @xcite , and the large radius , @xmath7  km , of the isolated neutron star rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( shorthand : rx j1856 ) @xcite .",
    "another example is exo 0748 - 676 , an lmxb for which the compact - star mass _ and _ radius have been constrained to @xmath8  m@xmath3 and @xmath9  km @xcite .",
    "however , the status of the results for the latter object is unclear , because the gravitational redshift @xmath10 observed in the x - ray burst spectra @xcite has not been confirmed , despite numerous attempts .",
    "while compact - star phenomenology apparently points towards a stiff eos at high density , heavy - ion collision data for kaon production @xcite and elliptic flow @xcite set an upper limit on the stiffness of the eos @xcite .",
    "a key question regarding the structure of matter at high density is whether a phase transition to quark matter occurs inside compact stars , and whether it is accompanied by unambiguous observable signatures .",
    "it has been argued that the observation of a compact star with high mass and large radius , likewise reported for exo 0748 - 676 , would be incompatible with a quark core @xcite , because the softening of the eos due to quark deconfinement lowers the maximum mass and the radius in comparison to the nuclear matter case .",
    "however , alford _",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated with a few counter examples that quark matter can not be excluded by this argument .",
    "in particular , for a recently developed hybrid star eos @xcite , based on the dbhf approach in the nuclear sector and a three - flavor chiral quark model @xcite , stable hybrid stars in the mass range from 1.2 m@xmath3 up to 2.1 m@xmath3 have been obtained , in accordance with modern mass - radius constraints , see also @xcite . in that model , a sufficiently low critical density for quark deconfinement was achieved with a strong diquark coupling , while a sufficient stiffness for a high maximum mass of the compact star sequence was obtained with a repulsive vector meanfield in the quark matter sector .",
    "the corresponding hybrid eos for symmetric matter was shown to fulfill the constraints from elliptic flow data in heavy - ion collisions . in the present work",
    "we want to discuss a new scenario of quark deconfinement , which could play an important role in asymmetric matter , in particular for the phenomenology of compact stars .",
    "chiral quark models of the njl type with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking have the property that the restoration of this symmetry ( and the related quark deconfinement ) at zero temperature is flavor specific .",
    "when solving the gap and charge - neutrality equations selfconsistently one finds that the chiral symmetry restoration for a given flavor occurs when the chemical potential of that flavor reaches a critical value that is approximately equal to the dynamically generated quark mass , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "in asymmetric matter the quark chemical potentials are different .",
    "consequently , the njl model behavior suggests that the critical density of deconfinement is flavor dependent , see fig .",
    "[ f : phases ] .    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< \" , ]     one of the main arguments for strange matter is the fact that superconducting phases , like the cfl phase , can suppress fast neutrino emission processes of all quark flavors and are able to fulfill the fusion ignition condition .",
    "however , as we have shown above , in the single flavor csl - phase the fast direct urca process is not possible at all , whereas slow neutrino cooling processes like bremsstrahlung of electrons and d - quarks occur .    as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f : profile - release ] the energy release from the conversion of dbhf nuclear matter to dbhf - csl hybrid matter gives 12 ( 8) mev for a compact star core with mass 1.4 ( 2.0 ) @xmath13 , which is in the range 1  100  mev and could , in principle , explain burst ignition at appropriate depths for a suitable value of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the compact star does not necessarily need to be made of strange matter , but could be a hybrid star with quark matter in the d - csl phase and a thin crust .",
    "_ @xcite show that deep crustal heating mechanisms at the crust - core boundary like the conversion of baryonic matter to strange quark matter , which can fulfill the constraints of the superburst scenario do provide a consistent explanation of the cooling of soft x - ray transients too .",
    "along the lines of this argument we claim that the d - quark drip effect at the crust core boundary , which leads to a mixture of nuclear matter with single - flavor quark matter in the csl phase can serve as a deep crustal heating mechanism @xcite .",
    "superbursts and the cooling of x - ray transients are not only consistent with quark matter in compact stars but may qualify as a signature !",
    "in this contribution we have suggested a new quark - nuclear hybrid eos for compact star applications that fulfills modern observational constraints from compact stars . due to isospin asymmetry",
    ", down - quarks may `` drip out '' from nucleons and form a single - flavor color superconducting ( csl ) phase that is mixed with nuclear matter already at the crust - core boundary in compact stars .",
    "the csl phase has interesting cooling and transport properties that are in accordance with constraints from the thermal and rotational evolution of compact stars .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether this new compact star composition could lead to unambiguous observational consequences .",
    "we conjecture that the d - quark drip may serve as an effective deep crustal heating mechanism for the explanation of the puzzling superburst phenomenon and the cooling of x - ray transients .",
