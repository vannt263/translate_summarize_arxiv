    "originally discovered by @xcite and @xcite , the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) was suggested by @xcite to be the physical mechanism driving the redistribution of angular momentum required for the accretion process in keplerian discs orbiting compact objects ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "keplerian discs have a positive radial gradient in angular momentum , and therefore are linearly ( rayleigh-)stable .",
    "purely hydrodynamic perturbations are unlikely to grow to amplitudes at which the associated stresses can account for efficient angular - momentum transport . in the presence of a weak magnetic field , however , a negative radial gradient in the angular velocity of the disc is magneto - rotationally unstable , and seed perturbations can grow exponentially on time scales close to the rotational period . during this phase ,",
    "_ channel modes _ develop .",
    "channel modes are pairs of coherent radial up- and down - flows stacked vertically and threaded by layers of magnetic field of alternating radial and azimuthal polarity . in these modes , the magnetic tension ( maxwell stress tensor ) transports angular momentum from the inner parts of the disc outwards .    the criterion for the mri onset can be formulated in a rather simple manner , even if the thermal stratification ( gradients of entropy or molecular weight ) and non - ideal effects ( viscosity , resistivity ) are included @xcite .",
    "this allows for its application beyond keplerian discs , in particular to proto - neutron stars ( pns ) resulting from the core - collapse of rotating massive stars .",
    "simplified simulations by @xcite showed that such pnss possess regions in which the mri can grow on shorter time scales than the time between the bounce and the successful explosion .",
    "this finding , later confirmed in multi - dimensional models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , presents the possibility of generating strong magnetic fields that can tap the rotational energy of the core , power mhd turbulence @xcite , and become a potentially important ingredient in rapidly - rotating core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) .",
    "how much these systems are affected by the mri crucially depends on both its growth rate and on the final amplitude to which the seed perturbations grow .",
    "we can give an upper limit by assuming that the mri ceases to grow once the magnetic field comes close to equipartition with the energy of the differential rotation . in a ccsn",
    ", this would correspond to dynamically important field strengths of @xmath2 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this estimate is an upper bound , since it neglects any effect quenching the mri before it taps all the available differential rotation energy .",
    "the physics of the saturation of the mri growth remains an active field of research with many studies devoted to finding the value of the @xmath3 parameter @xcite for the stress tensor .",
    "we refer , among others , to the works of @xcite .",
    "the model of parasitic instabilities by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gx94 hereafter ) , further studied and developed by @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * pg09 hereafter ) and @xcite provides a clear physical picture of the termination mechanism .",
    "the mri channel modes are characterised by a shear layer and a current sheet in the vertical profiles of velocity and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "hence , the ( laminar ) channel flows can be unstable against _ secondary _ ( or _ parasitic _ ) _ instabilities _ of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) or tearing - mode ( tm ) type .",
    "initially , the role of the parasites is negligible , as they grow much more slowly than the mri .",
    "however , since the growth rate of the secondary instabilities is proportional to the channel mode amplitude ( which grows exponentially with time ) , it is clear that at some stage the parasites will grow faster than the mri channels ( whose growth rate is constant ) .",
    "roughly at this point , the parasitic instabilities should disrupt the channel modes and terminate the mri growth , marking the transition to the turbulent saturation phase ( pg09 ) .",
    "@xcite analytically studied the mri termination in resistive - viscous mhd by solving simplified model equations for the evolution of the parasitic instabilities .",
    "he identified different parameter - space regimes where , depending on hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers , either the kh instability or the tm is the dominant ( i.e.  faster developing ) secondary instability . in the regime relevant for ccsne , the mri should be terminated by the kh instability .",
    "some of the predictions of the parasitic model have been confirmed by @xcite , who performed semi - global mri simulations of a pns following @xcite .",
    "they found , that given the ccsne conditions , the mri growth is indeed terminated by secondary parasitic kh instabilities .",
    "moreover , the properties of these secondary instabilities were in a good agreement with the parasitic model . as expected , the parasitic instabilities developed along the velocity channels , displaying a very good agreement of the orientation under which the parasites develop , whereas the wavelength of the parasitic modes was smaller by a factor of two w.r.t .",
    "the theoretical predictions .",
    "motivated by this good agreement , we test in this paper further predictions of the parasitic model , especially those for the maximum amplification of the maxwell stress by the mri channel modes at termination .",
    "two different termination criteria were proposed within the parasitic model ( pg09 ) .",
    "depending on the termination criterion used in their calculations , @xcite and @xcite obtained different estimates for the maximum magnetic field amplification .",
    "so far , these predictions have not been tested with direct numerical simulations .    in order to properly define the in which this paper is written",
    ", we should clearly state what we mean by magnetic field amplification , since there can be more than a single amplification stage .",
    "there is a primary magnetic field amplification resulting from the exponential field growth starting from the initial magnetic seed and ending when coherent mri channels are disrupted , the field growth saturates and a turbulent state results . in the turbulent state ,",
    "subsequent episodes of ( secondary ) mri amplification may be driven , or a turbulent dynamo could be formed . in this work ,",
    "we only concentrate on the primary magnetic field amplification , as a further discussion of the mri turbulent state is beyond the scope of this paper .    in sec .",

    "we study the mri in a small portion of the rotating star at a given distance @xmath20 from the rotation axis , embedded in a magnetic field . for convenience ,",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates @xmath21 , hereafter .",
    "we restrict our analysis to locations close to the equatorial plane ( @xmath22 ) and vertical perturbation wavevectors for which the mri is known to develop fastest ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we note , however , that @xcite , used a different definition of the reynolds numbers , namely , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vertical size of the computational domain .",
    "we point out that assuming @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which is the case in all simulations done with the code snoopy presented in this paper ( see sect.[sec : snoopy ] ) , those differently defined reynolds numbers are related by @xmath59 from now on , we will only use reynolds numbers defined in eqs.([eq : re ] ) and ( [ eq : rm ] ) .    for the reynolds numbers considered in our studies , i.e.@xmath60 , the characteristics of the fastest - growing mri mode ( i.e.  its growth rate , wavelength , and angles ) do not change by more than @xmath61 with respect to the ideal mhd case ( pc08 ) .",
    "we are therefore going to use eqs.([eq : kmri])([eq : amplitude_ratio ] ) in our farther analysis .",
    "for a more detailed discussion of non - ideal effects , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "gx94 suggested that mri channels may be unstable against parasitic instabilities , which could terminate the mri growth .",
    "they found in their analytic calculations that in ideal mhd ( shear driven ) kh modes can develop on top of mri channels .",
    "gx94 also suggested that in resistive mhd , parasitic instabilities of the ( current driven ) tm type could develop , too .",
    "analytical calculations of @xcite in resistive mhd confirmed this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite extended these analytical studies to resistive - viscous mhd .",
    "he identified regions in parameter space , where depending on the values of the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers either kh or tm is the dominant ( i.e.  faster developing ) secondary instability that terminates mri growth .",
    "in particular , for the conditions prevailing in ccsne outside of the neutrinosphere ( @xmath62 ) the exponential growth phase of the mri should be terminated by kh instabilities .",
    "this hypothesis was confirmed with direct numerical simulations of @xcite . in the remaining part of this subsection",
    ", we will first discuss the basic assumptions of the parasitic model then , we present some estimates which can be derived from it .",
    "a test of these predictions done with two different numerical codes will be presented in sec.[sec : results ] .    to compute the evolution of the parasitic instabilities , gx94 considered perturbations in a system with already well developed mri channels given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the velocity and the magnetic field of the parasitic instabilities , respectively . solving the equations governing",
    "the evolution of the secondary ( parasitic ) instabilities is a very challenging task , because mri channels , which are treated as a background field for the perturbations , are non - stationary .",
    "hence , standard analytical techniques can not be used . to make this task more tractable for analytic studies ,",
    "gx94 considered a stage of mri growth when the amplitude of the mri channels is much larger than the initial weak magnetic field , i.e.  @xmath66 .",
    "the growth rate of the secondary instabilities @xmath67 ( which scales @xmath68 ) is then much larger than the mri growth rate , i.e.  @xmath69 . under these conditions",
    "the time evolution of the mri channels , the coriolis force , the background shear flow , and the initial background magnetic field @xmath70 can be neglected because they act on timescales comparable to @xmath71 .",
    "hence , instead of searching for solutions to perturbations according to eqs.([channel_full_p1 ] ) and ( [ channel_full_p2 ] ) , gx94 considered a simplified system where the velocity and the magnetic field are given by @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the time at which the secondary perturbations are imposed .",
    "the same assumptions were also made in the studies of @xcite , pg09 and @xcite , even though these authors extrapolated their results to the regime in which @xmath74 , in which case neglecting the above mentioned terms is not fully justified .",
    "therefore , the analytical results obtained by @xcite and @xcite within the parasitic model can probably be improved , and direct numerical simulations should be used to test the former theoretical predictions .    in the ideal mhd limit , the dominant parasitic mode is of the kh type that develops along the mri velocity channel ( the projection of which in the horizontal plane , forms an angle @xmath75 with respect to the radial direction in the anticlockwise sense ) and is characterised by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath76 and grows at a rate @xmath77 @xcite observed in their numerical simulations that for @xmath60 indeed the dominant parasitic modes are of the kh type and develop along the velocity channels .",
    "however , the wavelength of the parasitic modes was by a factor of two smaller than theoretically expected . as those authors did not investigate in detail the source of this discrepancy , the question whether it arises as a result of the numerics or truly from the underlying physics remains open .",
    "since the mri growth rate is constant in time ( see eq.([eq : gammamri ] ) ) and the growth rate of the kh instability grows exponentially with time ( as @xmath78 ) , it is clear that at some point the latter will exceed the former , i.e.  @xmath79 .",
    "ultimately , the parasitic instabilities will therefore start to drain more energy from the mri channels than the mri can feed into them .",
    "this should eventually lead to the channel disruption ( gx94 ) .",
    "pg09 proposed that the mri is terminated at the time , @xmath80 , when @xmath81 according to this criterion , by comparing eq .",
    "( and with the help of eqs .",
    "[ eq : kmri ] and [ eq : amplitude_ratio ] ) , one can find that ( independently of the value of @xmath33 ) @xmath82",
    "pg09 also suggested an alternative termination criterion , i.e.  that it happens when the amplitudes of the mri channels and parasitic modes are comparable , that is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the amplitudes of the parasitic instabilities .",
    "however , they did not investigate this last criterion in more detail analytically , as in this regime the problem becomes non - linear .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by @xcite , the termination criterion ii seems to be physically much better justified .",
    "indeed , at the stage when parasites grow at an equal rate as the mri channels , but the amplitudes of the parasites are much smaller ( because they have been growing at a lower rate than the mri ) , they can be still treated as small terms that can be neglected . therefore , they should be of no physical importance and , in particular , should not be able to quench the mri growth . using termination criterion",
    "ii ( and taking into account the influence of the background shear in an approximate way ) , @xcite estimated that the background shear could increase the termination amplitude to @xmath86 ( depending on the considered amplitude of the parasitic perturbations ) , which is a considerably larger value than that estimated using the termination criterion i ( eq.[eq : b3.8 ] ) .",
    "summing up the theoretical estimates , we find , on the one hand , that termination criterion i most probably underestimates the amplification of the magnetic field at mri termination .",
    "nevertheless , it may serve as a proxy for termination since , as we shall see from our numerical models , within 23 mri time scales ( i.e.  @xmath71 ) after the growth rates are equal , the mri channels will be disrupted by the parasitic instabilities .",
    "on the other hand , in order to use the termination criterion ii , by its own definition , we should not treat parasitic perturbations as small , linearising the equations in terms of them , which makes it difficult to provide analytic estimates with a more physically adequate condition for mri termination .",
    "this is why numerical simulations are indispensable to test the predictions of the parasitic model .",
    "we define the absolute value of the volume - averaged maxwell stress component as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the volume of the computational domain , and the amplification factor as @xmath89 where @xmath90 . assuming that at termination , the mri channels are still given by eq.([eq : channel_b ] ) ( i.e.  undistorted ) and ignoring the contribution of the parasitic instabilities , the maxwell stress is @xmath91 hence , from the estimate done by pg09 using the termination criterion i ( eq .  [ eq : b3.8 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath92    next , we want to make some estimates of the mri termination amplitude within the parasitic model using the second termination criterion ( eq .  [ eq : term2 ] ) .",
    "note that we begin our analysis from the equations obtained by @xcite under some simplifying assumptions and that we will further introduce additional simplifications .",
    "therefore , our estimates must be tested with the simulation results presented in sec.[sec : results ] .    in order to make use of the second termination criterion",
    ", we need to first find the time evolution of the parasitic kh modes . for this purpose , we assume that during their whole evolution , i.e.  from their onset until the mri termination , they can be factored in the following terms @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the instability amplitude and includes the time evolution of the perturbation , and @xmath95 is a normalised function ( i.e.  @xmath96 ) that does not depend on time ( its explicit form can be found in * ? ? ?",
    "note that the factorisation assumed in eq.([eq:4 ] ) may fail because , among other reasons , ( i ) we neglect effects proportional to @xmath23 ( the shear and the coriolis force ) , and ( ii ) because shortly before the mri termination , when @xmath97 , the kh instability will enter the non - linear phase of its evolution . in this phase",
    "the kh perturbations eventually become comparable to the background shear , and the growth of the instability is reduced before its final termination ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can find the time evolution of @xmath94 from the definition of the kh instability growth rate , i.e. @xmath98 provided that @xmath99 is known .",
    "the resulting differential equation can be integrated analytically if we assume @xmath100 , where @xmath101 , we recover eq.([eq : gammakh ] ) , however for the time being we want to use a bit more general expression .",

    "now , we can determine the mri termination amplitude from the condition @xmath107 where for @xmath108 , we recover the termination criterion ii exactly , but we allow this parameter to slightly vary , as the choice @xmath108 is somewhat arbitrary . with the help of eqs.([eq : vc_t ] ) and ( [ eq : vkh_time ] ) , we can rewrite the above condition as @xmath109 + { \\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\ ] ] where the term on the lhs of eq.([eq : term2_step ] ) is equal to the definition of the velocity amplitude at termination @xmath110 ( see , eq.[eq : vc_t ] ) .",
    "we note that eq.([eq : term2_step ] ) should be treated as an equation for @xmath111 .",
    "there is a trivial solution , @xmath112 , for @xmath113 .",
    "however , these are not physically plausible initial conditions . for the mri channels to be destroyed by the kh instability",
    ", they should exist in the first place .",
    "so even if we start with completely random initial perturbations ( which is physically plausible ) , we first expect the mri channels to develop , implying that @xmath114 .",
    "then , after a sufficiently developed velocity shear sets in between the channels , the parts of the initial perturbations which do not promote the growth of the mri will seed the growth of the kh instabilities . in practical terms , this means that we can safely assume that @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) . from eqs.([eq : amplitude_ratio ] ) and ( [ eq : mmm_term ] ) , we find @xmath117 comparing eq.([eq : vc_term_step ] ) with eq.([eq : term2_step ] ) , we obtain @xmath118 +   \\sqrt { \\frac{4 - q}{4   q }   }   \\frac{{\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{c}}}}{{c_{\\mathrm{a } z}}},\\ ] ] where we also used eqs.([eq : kmri ] ) and ( [ eq : gammamri ] ) . from eqs.([eq : vc_t ] ) , evaluated at @xmath119 , and ( [ eq : vc_term_step ] ) , we find @xmath120 that we substitute into eq.([eq : aaa_time ] ) , to finally obtain @xmath121 +   \\sqrt { \\frac{4 - q}{4   q }   }   \\frac{{\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{c}}}}{{c_{\\mathrm{a } z}}}.\\ ] ] since , typically @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the amplification factor should be almost independent of the initial mri channel amplitude and depend logarithmically on the ratio of the initial velocity amplitude of the parasitic instabilities to the amplitude of the background alfvn speed ( or , equivalently , the initial magnetic field strength ) . for @xmath124 ( the value calculated by pg09 ) , @xmath125 and @xmath126 ( a typical value used in our simulations ) , we obtain @xmath127    finally",
    ", we discuss the results of @xcite who gave an approximate description of the influence of the background shear on the development of the parasitic instabilities .",
    "they pointed out that due to shear , the radial wavenumber of non - axisymmetric parasitic modes increases linearly with time while the azimuthal wavenumber remains unchanged . as a consequence , during most of its evolution",
    ", the parasitic mode is expected to grow at a rate smaller than that predicted by gx94 , since its wavelength and orientation w.r.t .",
    "the velocity channel is not optimal .",
    "moreover , the parasitic mode can only grow for a limited time @xmath128 before the shear prevents its further growth completely .",
    "@xcite found that the dominant mode would have at most a time of @xmath129 for its development .",
    "furthermore , they roughly estimated that the growth rate of the mode is reduced by a factor of two as a result of the shear , i.e. @xmath130 and calculated the mri termination amplitude , from the condition ( [ eq : term_2_s ] ) assuming that parasitic perturbations are introduced at @xmath131 and that @xmath132 .",

    "hence , the growth of @xmath207 until @xmath206 , can not be caused ( only ) by parasitic instabilities .",

    "this growth of @xmath208 can be explained by the following reasons .",
    "firstly , as mri magnetic channels grow , they will generate a non - uniform magnetic pressure accelerating fluid in the vertical direction ( towards magnetic null surfaces of the mri channels , cf.gx94 ) . secondly , the initially purely radial profile of the gas pressure will acquire a vertical gradient due to the advective transport of internal energy in the up- and down - flows of the channel modes .",
    "this in turn will create pressure gradients in the vertical direction and hence vertical fluid motions to redistribute the pressure and equilibrate the system .",
    "thirdly , this vertical motions could be related to the radial boundary conditions .",
    "the mri growth rate is not constant in the whole computational domain , as @xmath209 .",
    "this means that the amplitude of the channel modes will grow at a higher rate at @xmath210 than at @xmath211 .",
    "consequently , once the mri channels are formed , there is a shear at the radial boundaries where we use periodic boundary conditions for the perturbations .",
    "this shear introduces some perturbations to all velocity and magnetic field components , whose influence can be best observed in the @xmath200 velocity component as it should not be affected by the dominant mri mode . during the exponential growth phase ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath200 is proportional to the amplitude of the mri channels , @xmath212 , so that , @xmath213 .",
    "a comparison of the upper panel of fig.[fig : white_wave ] with an analogous plot for simulation # s19 done with snoopy ( bottom panel of fig.[fig : white_wave ] ) provides another argument supporting our hypothesis that those axisymmetric vertical motions are mostly of the numerical origin . in the snoopy simulation ,",
    "the growth of the vertical motions , quantitatively indicated by @xmath203 , from @xmath214 is triggered by a subdominant axisymmetric mri mode with a non - zero radial component .",
    "note that @xmath203 becomes comparable to @xmath204 only when the genuine parasitic instabilities start to grow superexponentially .",
    "however , as much as part of those vertical motions in the aenus simulation is clearly of a numerical origin , we should not be concerned too much with that . even though these axisymmetric modes are dominant non - mri modes before real parasitic instabilities appear , they do not cause the mri termination . in spite of the fact that the amplitude of these artificial modes is some @xmath215 of the channel modes , the mri can grow unaffected by them .

    "[ eq:<v > ] ) for the same aenus model as in the upper panel . , title=\"fig : \" ]    this can be clearly again seen with the help of fourier analysis ( see the upper panel of fig.[fig:04 ] ) . until @xmath216 , the axisymmetric modes of @xmath200 account for @xmath217 of the kinetic energy stored in the @xmath200 component . however , once the parasitic instabilities appear and start to contribute to this component , the fraction of the axisymmetric modes @xmath200 drops significantly and very rapidly . at @xmath218 , the contribution of axisymmetric modes to @xmath208 is @xmath219 , and only half a millisecond later , i.e.  at @xmath220 , @xmath221 . at the mri termination , i.e.@xmath222 ,",
    "the total contribution of the axisymmetric modes is only @xmath223 .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that those modes do not play a decisive role in the mri termination and that the instability is terminated by genuine non - axisymmetric parasitic modes .",
    "another difference between the aenus and snoopy simulations is that in the former , non - axisymmetric @xmath224 and @xmath225 modes grow from the beginning of the simulation , thought until @xmath226 at a rate lower than @xmath204 ( upper panels of fig.[fig : parasitic ] ) , whereas in the latter , these modes basically do not grow until @xmath227 ( upper panels of fig.[fig : parasitic_snoopy ] ) .",
    "this suggest that in the aenus simulation , radial boundary conditions introduce also some non - axisymmetric perturbations ( which in turn could be used as seed perturbations for genuine non - axisymmetric parasitic modes ) . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we compute the vertically and azimuthally averaged rms amplitude of the non - axisymmetric part of the velocity component @xmath200 , i.e.@xmath228 ^ 2 { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi       { \\mathrm{d}}z   } { \\int { \\mathrm{d}}\\phi \\int { \\mathrm{d}}z } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath229 before the termination ( bottom panel of fig.[fig:04 ] ) . from this panel",
