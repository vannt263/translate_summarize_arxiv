    "the northwest arm corresponds to peaks with higher velocities , while the southeast arm corresponds to peaks with lower velocities .",
    "the other peaks come from the main disk .",
    "these distinct velocities between the main disk and spiral arms ( typically @xmath123 ) produce the @xmath8-shaped twists in the first - moment map .",

    "the spiral arms are rooted to the nucleus , forming an inverted @xmath8-shaped pattern on the sky .",
    "the nuclear disk shows a sign of an existence on the pv diagram ( figure [ fig : pvd ] ) : remarkable velocity - peaks appear symmetrically at ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) and ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) .",

    "this sequence seems to be rotating in this innermost region and forming a nuclear disk .",
    "the nuclear disk is obviously distinct from other velocity - peaks in the innermost region ( at @xmath138 in figure [ fig : pvd ] ) , because their corresponding peaks appear only in the diagram with @xmath136-offset ; we thus think that they are consequences of the nuclear core ( see @xmath59 [ sec : core ] ) .",
    "the very high co concentration within the nuclear disk ( @xmath139 ; figure [ fig : pvd ] and [ fig : srfd ] ) indicates its distinct nature from the main disk .",
    "we conclude that the component which appears as the peaks and ridges in the pv diagrams is the nuclear disk .",
    "this component is rotating around the galaxy center with the northside approaching and southside receding .",
    "in the three panels of figure [ fig : ewpvd ] , the ridges corresponding to the nuclear disk are not on a straight line connecting their two velocity peaks : the ridges are bent downward and upward in the @xmath135 and @xmath137 offset diagrams respectively , while the ridge twists upward ( at the left - hand side ) and downward ( right - hand side ) in the @xmath136-offset diagram .",
    "the deviations from the straight line amount up to @xmath140 . these symmetrical bends and twist indicate that the gas in the nuclear disk takes oval orbits rather than circular ( see @xmath59 [ sec : dyn ] ) .",

    "the distinct kinematics of this core from the other components is evident in a series of pv diagrams which have positional offsets along the galaxy minor axis ( figure [ fig : ewpvd ] ) . among the three diagrams with @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137-offsets",
    ", the nuclear core appears only in the central one .",
    "the high velocities indicate a large dynamical mass in this nuclear region if the gas is pure - circularly rotating ; we will discuss this in @xmath59 [ sec : orgcore ] .",

    "it is also confirmed in channel maps ( figure [ fig : chmap ] ) in almost all the velocities ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the central gas density of the nuclear core is as high as @xmath149 , which is about an order of magnitude higher than is typical for nearby normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "this value is however a lower limit , because the core is unresolved even in our high resolution observations ( @xmath150 ) , the total flux within the radius of @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) is @xmath153 ; the corresponding gas mass is @xmath154 .      on the molecular disk of ngc 3079",

    "though a stellar bar is not seen in optical / infrared photographs in this nearly edge - on galaxy , there is some indirect evidence for the presence of a bar : the peanut - shaped bulge @xcite ; the `` figure - of - eight '' pattern on the pv diagram @xcite ; the high central concentration of the molecular gas @xcite ; the @xmath3 velocity field well - fitted by an oval - orbit model in a weak bar @xcite .",
    "we thus propose a model that ngc 3079 contains a weak bar .",
    "this model naturally explains the features in @xmath59 [ sec : result ] : the main disk and spiral arms ( or offset ridges ) may result from gaseous @xmath14-orbits and associated crowding respectively . the nuclear disk may arise from gaseous @xmath15-orbits .",
    "this model however can not interpret the nuclear core , which necessitates a massive component besides the bar at the galaxy center .",

    "we present below our detailed case for the existence of the weak bar , and discuss the origin of the main disk , spiral arms , nuclear disk and core .",
    "we adopt a damped orbit model by @xcite and @xcite to describe gas motions in a weak bar potential .",
    "this model solves the equation of motion which includes a damping - force term to emulate the collisional nature of the gas , and obtains closed orbits for gas in a bar .",

    "the position angle @xmath174 of orbits changes with radius owing to the damping force , producing crowded regions of the orbits ( figure [ fig : orbits ] ) .",
    "the crowding of the gaseous @xmath14-orbits which appear at the leading edge of the bar result in the spiral arms ( or so - called offset ridges ) , which are similar to those on the molecular disk of ngc 3079 .",
    "the slightly enhanced co emission in the zeroth - moment map of ngc 3079 ( figure [ fig : mom01 ] ) may arise from the high gas densities in the crowded regions .",
    "the streamlines belonging to the @xmath14-orbits extend entirely to the disk , producing the main disk .",
    "our model streamlines have sharp turns at the spiral arms .",
    "such features , accompanied by shocks , have been observed by other authors @xcite in full hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "these turns can produce double - peaked features in line - profiles observed along the spiral arms ( figure [ fig : lineprof ] ) , and agree spatially with the @xmath8-shaped twists on the first - moment map of ngc 3079 ( figure [ fig : mom01 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pvcomp ] shows a comparison between the observed and model pv diagrams ; contours are from the observed one , while the symbols show the model one , where different symbols are used for gaseous particles on the spiral arms ( squares ) and on the main disk ( dots ) . on this diagram again , the main disk and spiral arms of ngc 3079 agree well with the gaseous @xmath14-orbits and their crowding respectively .",
    "this match between the observations and the model suggests that the main disk and spiral arms result from gaseous @xmath14-orbits and their associated crowding , respectively .",
    "in the context of our model , gas streamlines on the downstream side of the sharp turns are nearly perpendicular to our line - of - sight .",
    "thus the line - of - sight velocity of the gas indicates the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "we estimate the pattern speed from the gradient of the spiral arms on the observed pv diagram , which appears to be @xmath179 ; this is our adopted value to describe gas orbits , and is consistent with the result of other authors ( @xmath180 from * ? ? ?",
    "* where the coincidence of corotation and the bar - end was assumed ) .",
    "the nuclear disk may result from gaseous @xmath15-orbits . in figure",
    "[ fig : pvcomp ] , the model pv diagram shows that the gaseous @xmath15-orbits ( crosses ) are in good agreement with the nuclear disk of ngc 3079 .",
    "figure [ fig : ewmdlpvd ] displays pv diagrams along the galaxy major axis for the orbits within the outer ilr .",
    "the three panels show pv cuts with @xmath181-width ( intrinsic to the galaxy ) and positional offsets for the east , central and west sides of the model galaxy respectively .",
    "these panels reveal that the bends and twist of the ridges discussed in  [",
    "sec : nstrm ] ( see figure [ fig : ewpvd ] ) are also reproduced in our model : the top and bottom panels show bends downward and upward respectively , while the middle panel shows a twist upward ( at the left - hand side ) and downward ( right - hand ) .",
    "since a purely rotating disk can not produce this type of symmetric bends and twist , the gas on the nuclear disk must take oval orbits .",
    "our gaseous @xmath15-orbits naturally reproduce the observed properties of the nuclear disk .    for later discussion in @xmath59 [ sec : orgcore ]",
    ", we mention the position angle of the @xmath15-orbits on the nuclear disk here in advance .",
    "the major axis of the orbits are inclined counterclockwise to the south from our line - of - sight in our current configuration ( figure [ fig : schview ] ) . on the other hand , orbits inclined in the opposite direction",
    "can also reproduce the nuclear disk on the pv diagram ( figure [ fig : pvd ] ) .",
    "these orbits however make the ridges on the eastern and western pv diagrams ( figure [ fig : ewmdlpvd ] ) bend in the opposite directions , and thus can not match the observations ( figure [ fig : ewpvd ] ) .",
    "therefore the orbits on the nuclear disk must have an inclination southward ( counterclockwise ) on the sky from our line - of - sight , like our gaseous @xmath15-orbits .",
    "many barred galaxies show an intense concentration of co emission in their central parts @xcite .",
    "ngc 3079 also has such concentration in the nuclear disk region ( see figure [ fig : srfd ] ) .",
    "this feature is well explained in the scenario of gas motions in bar : gas flow on @xmath14-orbits like ours leads to offset shocks at the leading edge of a bar , and results in an inflow of gas toward the nuclear region .",
    "then the inflowing gas on the @xmath14-orbits collides with gaseous @xmath15-orbits near the pericenter of the @xmath14-orbits , entering onto the gaseous @xmath15-orbits , thus increasing mass densities in the nuclear disk .",
    "this scenario has been confirmed in hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "our current model naturally explains the main features of the molecular disk of ngc 3079 , which are the consequences of gas motions in a weak bar .",
    "however the model does not explain the nuclear core which appears in the pv diagram as high velocity - peaks near the galaxy center ( figure [ fig : pvd ] ) .",
    "owing to our ability to match the observations with our model for a bar , we attribute the high velocities to another origin , a massive central component , besides the bar .",
    "there still is a small possibility that the high velocities may arise from gaseous @xmath14-orbits within the inner ilr which could elongate along our line - of - sight .",
    "however the gaseous @xmath14-orbits are not the likely origin for two reasons .",
    "\\(1 ) our gaseous @xmath14-orbits within the inner ilr ( @xmath163 ) look near circular , thus can not show high velocities at their pericenter .",
    "numerical experiments have also shown similar features : circular orbits in the innermost regions @xcite . in the intensive study of pv diagrams for galaxies with bars by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the @xmath14-orbits within the inner ilr do not produce any remarkable features ( and velocity - peaks ) on the pv diagrams .",
    "these all imply no significant contribution of the @xmath14-orbits within the inner ilr to our pv diagram .",
    "( 2 ) even if the gaseous @xmath14-orbits are elongated , they must be near perpendicular to our line - of - sight , and can not show us high velocities which occur at their pericenter , because the position angles @xmath174 of @xmath14- and @xmath15-orbits , measured clockwise from the bar to the north ( figure [ fig : orbits ] _ top _ ) , are intrinsically @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively for collisionless stars . owing to the damping force ( working as viscosity ) , the two orbits drag each other and make @xmath184 and @xmath185 for collisional gas",
    ". this mechanism does not allow @xmath186 to become larger than @xmath187 .",
    "in addition to @xmath188 , our gaseous @xmath15-orbits ( nuclear disk ) of ngc 3079 have to be inclined southward ( counterclockwise ) on the sky from our line - of - sight for the reason discussed in @xmath59 [ sec : orgndsk ] .",
    "thus the elongated gaseous @xmath14-orbits ( if they exist ) must be near perpendicular to our line - of - sight , and can not show the observed high - velocity features .",
    "there are many disk galaxies which exhibit double bars , i.e. global and nuclear bars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if ngc 3079 has a nuclear bar other than our global bar , it may result in the observed high - velocity features .",
    "this however is not the likely origin because such a nuclear bar is also thought to be a consequence of the @xmath14- and @xmath15-orbits in our global bar , whose orientations can not be aligned with our line - of - sight .",
    "recently @xcite discussed that a nuclear bar could be dynamically decoupled with a global bar in an evolutional phase , having a random orientation from the global bar . in that phase",
    "the @xmath14- and @xmath15-orbits have dissapeared @xcite , which is not the case for ngc 3079 .",
    "central components with high velocities are often found in rotation - curve studies of external galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are attributed to central massive components @xcite while gas streaming motions in a bar could be another possible origin @xcite . in this section",
    ", we clarified detailed kinematics and the effect of a bar on the gas disk of ngc 3079 , and discussed that the high velocity should be attributed to a massive component at the galaxy center .",
    "we discussed in  [ sec : orgcore ] that the high velocity peaks at the radius of @xmath189 in the pv diagram are not likely to result from noncircular motions driven by a bar , but are a consequence of circular rotation around the nuclear core .",
    "we here estimate the central dynamical mass using a rotation curve .",
    "the observed pv diagram in the galaxy center suffers from large intrinsic velocity dispersions , and spill - in of emission from outer low velocity components owing to the finite spatial resolution and slit width .",
    "thus the central rotation curve is not straightforwardly obtained from an observed pv diagram .",
    "we adopt the takamiya & sofue method to obtain the rotation curve of the nuclear core .",
    "this method is designed to iteratively determine a rotation curve in an innermost region of a galaxy so that a model pv diagram calculated from the rotation curve and the galaxy s emission profile could reproduce the original diagram .",
    "figure [ fig : tsrc ] displays pv diagrams and rotation curves of the nuclear core : the left - hand panel shows the observed one along the galaxy major axis with @xmath134 slit - width , while the middle and right - hand panels show the calculated ones in the ts method and in the peak - tracing method respectively .",
    "the emission profile at the center ( @xmath189 ) can not be derived directly from our data owing to our spatial resolution ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "but the observations are indicative of its very sharp gradient , because even a point source can reproduce our observed profile through a convolution with the synthesized beam .",
    "thus we assumed the emission profile as an analytic function of an exponential with the scale length of @xmath134 , which well reproduces observed features on the pv diagram .",
    "we assumed intrinsic velocity dispersions of @xmath191 ( e.g. @xmath192 in the galactic center from * ? ? ?",
    "* which is less active than ngc 3079 ) .",
    "the pv diagram and rotation curve from the ts method show that the envelope of the observed pv diagram requires a sharp rise of the rotation curve at the central region .",
    "the observed emission at around @xmath193 , which is not well reproduced in the ts method , may be contaminated by the emission from the nuclear disk surrounding the nuclear core . for a comparison , the right - hand panel displays the pv diagram using the rotation curve derived by tracing peak - intensity velocities of the observed pv diagram ( the peak - tracing method ) ; this method is often used to obtain rotation curves , but fails in reproducing the observed high velocity at the central part .",
    "the dynamical mass within a radius @xmath194 is estimated by @xmath195 our spatial resolution is about @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) , and the rotation velocity at this radius is @xmath78 from the rotation curve in the ts method ( figure [ fig : tsrc ] _ middle _ ) .",
    "thus the dynamical mass within the central @xmath152 of ngc 3079 is estimated to be @xmath196 .",
    "the ratio of dynamical mass to the total molecular gas mass ( @xmath197 from  [ sec : core ] ) in the nuclear core is @xmath198 .",
    "the rotation curve is meaningful at the radius less than @xmath151 , even though the spatial resolution is only @xmath190 : we can distinguish two emission peaks only if their spatial separation is larger than @xmath151 on a single channel map or zeroth - moment map .",
    "however on the pv diagram and rotation curve , the additional parameter , velocity , provides a finer spatial resolution , because two emission peaks with different velocities can be resolved in the pv diagram even if their separation is less than @xmath151 . then the spatial resolution will be determined by the typical error of a gaussian fit to a point source , which depends on the signal - to - noise ratio , and in our case is @xmath199 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the velocity of @xmath200 at the radius of @xmath134 ( @xmath21 ) is meaningful , and implies a dynamical mass of @xmath201 within the radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the derived masses are listed in table [ tab : masstab ] .",
    "recently central supermassive black holes with mass @xmath202 have been found in many agns @xcite . in the case of ngc 3079 , vlbi observations of @xmath22 maser emission",
    "indicate that its central mass within @xmath203 is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus our mass @xmath204 within @xmath13 can not be attributed to this central supermassive black hole .",
    "the connection between this large dynamical mass and the nuclear outflow in parsec - scale @xcite and kiloparsec - scale @xcite in this galaxy will be an interesting issue for future investigations .",
    "we have made co ( 1 - 0 ) observations of the @xmath3/radio lobe galaxy ngc 3079 with the nobeyama millimeter array , and reported characteristic features and gas dynamics in the molecular disk in the central @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the main disk extends along the galaxy major axis .",
    "we detected the inner region of this component , within the radius of @xmath6 on a zeroth - moment map , while its full extent is not covered in our synthesis observations .",
    "molecular gas shows a smooth distribution on the main disk , and has a gas mass of @xmath5 within the central @xmath6 .",
    "the spiral arms are superimposed on the main disk , forming an inverted @xmath8-shaped pattern on the sky .",
    "abrupt velocity changes of up to @xmath7 are observed along the spiral arms , in @xmath8-shaped twists of isovelocity contours and double velocity - peaked features on the spectra .",
    "this component and the nuclear disk form the so - called `` figure - of - eight '' pattern on a pv diagram , which sometimes appears in edge - on barred galaxies .",
    "the nuclear disk , appearing in pv diagrams , has an extent of @xmath9 radius .",
    "the molecular gas is intensely concentrated on the nuclear disk , where the gas surface density is an order of magnitude higher than that typical of nearby galaxies .",
    "its appearance ( bends and twist ) on pv diagrams is indicative of oval motions in the gas , rather than circular . and the position angle of the oval orbits is inclined southward from our line - of - sight .",
    "the nuclear core has a radius smaller than @xmath205 , which is unresolved in our current observations .",
    "the gas mass within the central @xmath205 amounts to @xmath11 .",
    "this component shows a very high velocity @xmath7 at the radius of the central @xmath13 on the pv diagram .",
    "\\6 . a weak bar model explain the features of the main disk , spiral arms , and nuclear disk in zeroth- and first - moment maps , pv diagrams , and the spectrum at each spatial point",
    ". the main disk and spiral arms result from gaseous @xmath14-orbits and their crowding respectively .",
    "the nuclear disk arises from gaseous @xmath15-orbits .",
    "the gas concentration in the nuclear disk is also explained in the context of our model : the gas on @xmath14-orbits moves along spiral arms ( or offset shocks ) , collides with the gas on @xmath15-orbits , and is accumulated onto the nuclear disk .",
    "assuming that the gas in spiral arms moves along streamlines perpendicular to our line - of - sight , the pattern speed of the bar can be estimated to be @xmath16 .",
    "\\7 . our model for a bar however does not explain the high velocity of the nuclear core .",
    "moreover , any orbit caused by a bar is not likely to produce that component .",
    "thus we attribute it to a central massive core with a dynamical mass of @xmath17 within the central @xmath18 , which is three orders of magnitude more massive than the mass of a central supermassive black hole .",
