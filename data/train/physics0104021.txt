    "there is a old classical problem that survived unsolved until now with a quite general belief that it has no enough importance to be worthy to spend time trying to understand it , sometimes claimed as unsolvable without a quantal treatment@xmath0 .",
    "the problem in focus is the effect of the radiation reaction force on the charged particle dynamic , as given by the lorentz - dirac equation@xmath1 , which should affect the validity of the equivalence principle at some circumstances@xmath2 .",
    "perhaps it is better to believe that any problem that survive such a long time has to be important and it is to be worthwhile to spend any time as necessary to figure out where we are wrong . in accordance to this belief",
    ", there is now a renewed interest on this subject , with works pointing to something new@xmath3 . by the way",
    ", we have to notice that some different features are emerging from radiation reaction force problem@xmath4 .",
    "there are a lot of works about this subject accumulated since the first attempt was made by dirac@xmath5 .",
    "however , the goal of this work is not to discuss about these papers , but , instead , to add a possibility to analyze this problem in a different perspective , with emphasis in the equivalence principle , which validity is used as a good starting point . from this point of view , one can show that what seems to be uncomfortable , as the presence of radiation for charged particle performing hyperbolic motion and its absence for one supported at rest in an uniform gravitational field@xmath6 , both equivalent as the equivalence principle is valid , should lead to a new physical feature performed by charged particles .",
    "as the subject of this work is about the conditions of validity or not of the equivalence principle , which is one of the foundations of the einstein general relativity , it is just to notice that results from general relativity are not used at any moment , in order to avoid any possibility to fall in a vicious causal recurrence .    what we have to do is to figure out the condition we have to provide such that a charged particle can reach a stable hyperbolic motion .",
    "it is necessary to furnish a subtle balance between an applied external force and the radiation reaction force to get an hyperbolic motion regime .",
    "an important consequence is that , taking account the equivalence principle , it implies a gravitational mass that is slight greater than the inertial mass .",
    "perhaps because the main experimental justification that led einstein to formulate the equivalence principle , which is one of the foundations of his general theory of relativity@xmath7 , is the numerical equality between inertial and gravitational mass , nowadays they are taken quite as synonymous , so we have to be aware to avoid misleading conclusions .",
    "it is very important to emphasize the central role played by the radiation reaction force , so a slight upper deviation of gravitational mass should be necessary to validate the equivalence principle",
    ".    however , a new feature emerges from an unexpected behavior of the gravitational and inertial mass relation at a very strong gravitational field , with the presence of a divergence that indicates a critical field value .",
    "such a strong gravitational field is just reachable at the early stage of the universe or , perhaps , near massive black holes , and the presence of the critical field value signs that the equivalence principle should not be valid at a very strong gravitational field , and certainly it coincides where the quantum effects turns to be relevant@xmath8 .",
    "hyperbolic motion is the natural generalization of the concept of the newtonian uniformly accelerated motion due to a constant force applied to a particle , which might be due to an uniform gravitational field . at relativistic level , as the velocity is upper limited by the light velocity , constant force do nt imply constant acceleration ; instead , it results the above mentioned hyperbolic motion , which denomination comes from the hyperbola that it is drawn in the @xmath9-plane by this kind of motion .",
    "an one dimensional hyperbolic motion of a particle of mass @xmath10 occurs as a solution of the relativistic equation of motion@xmath11 @xmath12 the relativistic force @xmath13 defined as @xmath14 when external force @xmath15 is parallel to velocity @xmath16 and it is constant in the proper referential frame . supposing the motion along the @xmath17-axes , the trajectory is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant proper acceleration and @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 the velocity of light . velocity and acceleration are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the relativistic force responsible by the hyperbolic motion is @xmath24    the choice of the metric tensor @xmath25 is such that @xmath26 for four velocity @xmath27and , at non relativistic limit , @xmath28 for four acceleration @xmath29@xmath30 .",
    "equation of motion of a classical charged particle , including radiation reaction force , is given by the well known lorentz - dirac equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the external four - force and @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the lorentz - dirac relativistic radiation reaction force .",
    "the first term is known as the schott term@xmath35 and it is responsible by the well known non physical runaway solutions .",
    "the second is the rohrlich term , related to the power radiated @xmath36    a well known condition for hyperbolic motion is @xmath37 which also implies @xmath38 , so it seems to be easy to produce hyperbolic motion of charged particles imposing a locally constant external force , as in the uncharged particle case , but it could be a mistake . to have a stable hyperbolic motion we have to get a very sensible balance between external and radiation reaction force , and before it",
    "the condition ( [ hyperbole ] ) is not true .",
    "it means that what happen before is very important to get a stable hyperbolic motion regime and , although we have the same equation ( [ eq_motion ] ) after that , the force @xmath39 is not just @xmath32 anymore . to figure out why ,",
    "let us consider the lorentz - dirac equation written as@xmath40 @xmath41    formal expansion like @xmath42 enables us to get a formal solution of lorentz - dirac equation as @xmath43 we can insert the mathematical identity @xmath44 to transform ( [ solution ] ) in a second order integro - differential equation @xmath45 which shows a possible non causal behavior . in an explicit form , we have @xmath46    actual hyperbolic motion implies ( [ orbit]-[force ] ) , from which it is easy to show that @xmath47 and , therefore , @xmath48 recovering the equation ( [ eq_motion ] ) , in accordance with equation ( [ ld - eq ] ) and condition ( [ hyperbole ] ) .",
    "but , while the motion is approaching the hyperbolic regime , we have a limiting process @xmath49 such that the total force behaves to @xmath50 to have an hyperbolic motion , it is imperative that the applied external force goes to @xmath51 as well as the radiation reaction force goes to @xmath52 such that , after reaching hyperbolic motion , @xmath53 @xmath54 given by ( [ force ] ) .    using ( [ force ] ) , spatial component of equation ( [ f - ext ] ) becomes @xmath55 and , from equations ( [ acceleration ] ) and ( [ rad - power ] ) , @xmath56    in the same way , time components become @xmath57 and @xmath58 from equations ( [ f - ext2]-[p - rohr2 ] ) , it is easy to see that the total force ( [ balance ] ) satisfies ( [ force ] ) necessary to have an hyperbolic motion .",
    "it shows that the external force necessary to produce an hyperbolic motion of neutral particle , @xmath59 is smaller than the external force ( [ f - ext2 ] ) necessary to give the same hyperbolic motion of charged particle .",
    "all external force applied to neutral particle is used to increase its kinetic energy , @xmath60 on the other hand , for charged particle , external force ( [ f - ext2 ] ) , that can be written as @xmath61 provides the increase of kinetic energy in the same amount as given in ( [ pot ] ) and supplies , through @xmath62 , the energy lost carried by radiation .",
    "we saw in the previous section that charged particle performing hyperbolic motion have to be submitted to an external force given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the measurable force related to the relativistic force by @xmath65 .",
    "the equivalence principle@xmath66 says that a particle at rest in the laboratory frame @xmath67 immersed in an uniform gravitational field @xmath68 is seen by observer in a free falling inertial frame @xmath69 as performing hyperbolic motion with local constant acceleration @xmath70 .",
    "the local constant force responsible by its hyperbolic motion is the normal force @xmath71 that supports the particle against the gravitational force @xmath72 , so , in absolute value it is equal to @xmath73 for uncharged particle .",
    "but , for charged particle , the normal force @xmath74 must be equal to the external force @xmath75 of equation ( [ beta - force ] ) for @xmath76 , @xmath77    this result suggests that the observer in the laboratory frame @xmath67 measures the gravitational force acting on charged particle as @xmath78 such that    @xmath79    should define the gravitational mass @xmath80 of charged particle with inertial mass @xmath10 . for a typical charged particles as electron or proton , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "so , in a field magnitude typical for a terrestrial gravitational field , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we can see that @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively for electron and proton , a very small numbers , such that @xmath88 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gravitational mass is just slight greater than the inertial mass , @xmath89 , and the gravitational and inertial mass relation defined by equation ( [ grav - mass ] ) is much as close to unit , @xmath90 .",
    "it means that there is no consequence , for practical purpose , due to this slight up deviation of gravitational mass in relation to the inertial mass , at least in a region with gravitational field of magnitude as considered above .",
    "in fact , it is true for a very long field interval , starting with @xmath91 and going until to reach a very strong gravitational field of the order @xmath92 , as we are going to show in the next step .",
    "figure    figure caption : gravitational and inertial mass relation , @xmath93 , as function of the gravitational field @xmath68 .",
    "there is a critical point defined by @xmath94 , which is particle dependent and has the value @xmath95 for proton .    in a such strong gravitational field region , the field dependence of @xmath96 , see equation ( [ grav - mass ] ) , starts to manifest , as we can see in the figure 1 .",
    "it increases very slowly and remains very close to unit , starting with @xmath91 until to reach the very strong field magnitude of the order @xmath92 , approaching the divergence point given by the condition @xmath97 .",
    "then , @xmath96 increases fast to the infinite as the gravitational field goes to its critical value @xmath94 .",
    "this critical field value is mass dependent , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 for electron and proton , respectively .",
    "where is possible to find such strong gravitational field ? certainly at the early time of the universe and , perhaps , near massive black holes hosted at the center of some galaxies . using the newtonian formula of the gravitational field , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 times the solar mass , @xmath102 .",
    "a charged particle must approach as close as @xmath103 to see a gravitational field strong as @xmath104 . the matter density to give such strong field",
    "is of order @xmath105 .",
    "the divergence of the gravitational and inertial mass relation at the critical field value signs that the equivalence principle should not be valid for very strong gravitational field , and the quantum effects turns to be relevant .",
    "it lasts some crude questions : what about general relativity at this very strong gravitational field ? or is it meaningful the concept of unification of general relativity and quantum theory@xmath106 ?    above the critical point @xmath104 , the relation @xmath96 turns to be negative , with a possible physical interpretation to be investigated .",
    "perhaps , it should bring us some light to figure out a new physics required to explain the recent data concerned to the cosmic rays with a very high energy , above @xmath107 .",
    "there is a possibility that the primary particles of the ultra energetic cosmic rays should be a relic of the charged particles scattered in the early stage of the universe@xmath108 .",
    "although the final equation of motion of neutral and charged particles in hyperbolic motion regime seems to be identical , we realize that there is a fundamental difference between them . for charged particle , actually , the total locally constant force is the sum of an applied and the radiation reaction forces in a subtle combination in such a way that results the same as for neutral particle .",
    "an extra force is necessary to supply the same kinetic energy as for uncharged particle plus the energy lost carried by radiation .",
    "an interesting implication , as the equivalence principle is taken account , is that the gravitational mass of charged particle must be greater than its inertial mass in a very small amount .",
    "it is small enough to not be detected by any experimental or practical devices , but it helps us to figure out the condition necessary to get an hyperbolic motion regime and to understand the meaning of its equivalence with a charged particle supported at rest in an uniform gravitational field .    until now the equality between gravitational and inertial mass was understood as the essence of the equivalence principle , condition we realized not to be true for charged particle , where , due to the presence of radiation reaction , a slight deviation of gravitational mass compared to inertial one is necessary to hold the equivalence principle .",
    "however , a new feature comes from the gravitational and inertial mass relation behavior for a very strong gravitational field , just reachable at the early stage of the universe or , perhaps , near massive black holes .",
    "there exists a critical , particle dependent , field value that signs a limit of validity of the equivalence principle .",
    "it certainly coincides where the quantum effects turns to be dominant ."
