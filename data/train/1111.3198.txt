    "entanglement is not only an enigmatic mathematical feature of quantum mechanics , but also a practically useful resource for quantum teleportation , communication and computation  @xcite , which are more efficient and fruitful than their classical counterparts .",
    "the reason that entanglement plays a critical role in quantum information processing is due to its quantum nonlocal effect .",
    "entanglement , a quantum state which can not be separated , is indeed the essential entity that evaluates whether a task can be accomplished in quantum level .",
    "the more entanglement is , the more prowess of the resource has .",
    "thus a great number of criteria for detection and quantification of entanglement  @xcite , both discrete and continuous cases , have been proposed in recent decades .    on a parallel route ,",
    "bell  @xcite proposed a way in the form of bell s inequality to describe quantum nonlocal property based on the assumptions of locality and realism .",
    "the violation of bell s inequality leads to the so - called bell nonlocality , which is a sufficient condition to detect entanglement  @xcite .",
    "however , the ability of identifying entanglement by bell s inequality seems limited for mixed states according to werner s proof  @xcite that there exist entangled mixed states which surprisingly admit local realistic hidden variable descriptions .",
    "the bell nonlocality is more restrictive than entanglement in general , the latter contains the former .",
    "epr steering  @xcite has gradually drawn some researchers attention and been regarded as the third quantum nonlocal phenomenon after entanglement and bell nonlocality .",
    "epr steering , like entanglement , was originated from shr \" odinger s reply to epr paradox  @xcite to show the inconsistency between quantum mechanics and local realism .",
    "epr steering can be understood as follows . for a pure entangled state held by two separated observers alice and bob ,",
    "bob s qubit can be  steered \" into different states although alice has no access to the qubit .",
    "the epr steering was formalized in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the authors proved that epr steering lies strictly intermediate between bell nonlocality and entanglement .",
    "within the hierarchy of nonlocal correlations , bell nonlocality is the strongest , followed by epr steering , while entanglement is the weakest .",
    "subsequently , ref .",
    "@xcite developed epr - steering inequality for two @xmath0-dimensional systems applicable to discrete and continuous variable ( cv ) observables .",
    "the authors in  @xcite investigated epr - steering on werner states of a pair of photons which are bell local experimentally .",

    "@xcite presented criteria to study the three types of nonlocal correlations for multipartite systems . for cv systems ,",
    "reid s epr inequality  @xcite has been widely used to test the existence of epr steering  @xcite .",

    "@xcite proposed the entropic inequality and successfully detected epr steering of some type of cv systems which do not violate reid s epr inequality in some regions , making a step forward to observe epr steering for a wider class of quantum systems .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate epr steering for some entangled states of two one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "two criteria are successively employed : reid s epr inequality  @xcite and the entropic inequality  @xcite .",
    "we find that not all of the entangled states violate reid s epr inequality and the entropic inequality , while they all violate the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality .",
    "this suggests that both criteria are not necessary and sufficient conditions to detect the epr steering .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the entangled cv wavefunctions to be investigated .",
    "we then study epr steering of the system by reid s epr inequality in sec .",
    "iii and the entropic inequality in sec .",
    "we end with some discussions on bell nonlocality in the last section .",

    "the wavefunctions @xmath7 are generally the linear combination of complete orthonormal eigenfunctions @xmath8 . for convenience here we consider two kinds of entangled cv wavefunctions , which are the superpositions of the ground state @xmath9 and the first excitation state @xmath10 , namely , @xmath11 @xmath12 they are entangled states except for parameter @xmath13 .",
    "now we first study epr steering that may exist in ( [ state0011 ] ) . in 1989",
    "reid introduced a cv inequality  @xcite to detect epr paradox .",

    "in ref .  @xcite",
    "the authors have developed an entropic inequality based on heisenberg uncertainty principle in the form of entropy .",
    "they demonstrated the reason why the entropic inequality is more efficient than reid s epr inequality , that is the latter focuses on up to second - order of the ovservables , while the former includes more .",
    "they also provide an example with a gaussian - type state @xmath37 for which for up to @xmath38 the entropic inequality is obviously more efficient than reid s epr inequality to detect epr steering for the whole range of parameters @xmath39 . here",
