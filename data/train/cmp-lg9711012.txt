    "the distinction between competence and performance popularized by @xcite ( @xcite ) is fundamental to modern linguistics .",
    "_ competence _ is the `` knowledge '' of a human language possessed by its users ( e.g. , as formalized in a grammar ) , while _ performance _ refers to how this knowledge is used to produce and comprehend utterances . to date , most applications of logic to natural language have concentrated on competence grammar .",
    "this paper suggests that techniques from logic such as proof nets @xcite might also be useful for describing the difficulty of processing center - embedded constructions , which is an aspect of human linguistic performance .",
    "it is well - known that center embedded constructions such as ( [ e : ce ] ) are more difficult to comprehend than corresponding right embedded constructions ( [ e : re ] ) .",
    "( the prefix ` ' indicates the example is difficult or impossible to comprehend ) .",
    "as @xcite ( @xcite ) notes , the difficulty of comprehending ( [ e : ce ] ) does not seem to be due to any single construction in ( [ e : ce ] ) , but rather to the way those structures are configured .",
    "he argues that ( [ e : ce ] ) should be treated as grammatical ( i.e. , possessing a well - formed syntactic analysis ) , but that its incomprehensibility arises from an inability of the human sentence processing mechanism to find that analysis .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) propose that short - term memory overload causes this incompleteness .",
    "the strictly right embedded constructions of the kind ( [ e : re ] ) can be generated by a right - linear grammar , and hence can be recognized by a finite state machine . in contrast , a simple application of the pumping lemma for regular sets shows that center embedded constructions of the kind ( [ e : ce ] ) can not be recognized by a finite state machine .",
    "however , it seems that all such comprehension difficulties can not completely be explained in terms of the memory requirements of a parsing automaton .",
    "as @xcite ( @xcite ) and others note , the particular constructions and their arrangement affect comprehensibility ; thus the processing difficulty of ( [ e : ce ] ) relative to ( [ e : re ] ) may be due in part to the fact that in ( [ e : ce ] ) the relative clauses involve object extraction , while in ( [ e : re ] ) the relative clauses involve subject extraction .",
    "the following example , from @xcite ( @xcite ) , shows that depth of center embedding alone can not account for all such processing difficulty .",
    "( [ e : scrc ] ) and ( [ e : rcsc ] ) are both doubly embedded structures consisting of a relative clause ( ) and a sentential complement ( ) , differing only in the order of embedding , and most phrase - structure parsing automata require the same amount of working memory to accept them both .",
    "however ( [ e : scrc ] ) is easier to comprehend than ( [ e : rcsc ] ) .",
    "the literature contains a number of proposals accounting for a variety of comprehensibility differences @xcite .",
    "these theories of processing overload differ in the predictions that they make , this paper does not attempt to choose between them , or to develop an alternative account .",
    "( indeed , there seems to be considerable uncertainty among theorists as to exactly which sentences cause processing overload ) .    however , all these proposals share the common feature that they posit that the human sentence processing mechanism is sensitive to the number and kind of `` incomplete dependencies '' encountered as the sentence is processed from left to right",
    ". the precise configurations of dependencies which purportedly lead to processing overload differ from theory to theory .",
    "unfortunately , the central notion of incomplete dependency , and its relationship both to grammar and to parsing mechanisms , is usually only informally explained in these proposals .",
    "this paper proposes that resource logics provide the appropriate tools to formalize and investigate such incomplete dependencies .",
    "the next section introduces resource logics and proof nets , and the following section uses these to express an account of the processing complexity of the examples just discussed .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of the relationship between that account and incremental semantic processing .",
    "most , if not all , contemporary linguistic theories are based on a view of language in which linguistic entities produce and consume resources .",
    "for example , a transitive verb is standardly viewed as something which requires two noun phrases , its subject and object , to fill its `` thematic grid , '' i.e. , fill its argument requirements in order to produce a complete clause , which can in turn serve as an argument of a higher verb .",
    "linguistic theories differ as to exactly what types of resources are involved in particular sentences , what structural configurations are required for a resource requirement to be filled , exactly what the rules for resource accounting are , and what other mechanisms play a role in language .",
    "for example , versions of categorial grammar such as @xcite ( @xcite ) s type - logical grammar are based solely on ( directionally sensitive ) resource accounting . on the other hand , modern versions of transformational grammar",
    "specify a set of configurations in which resource consumption can occur ( e.g. , feature cancellation occurs in a spec - head configuration ) and provides structural operations ( merge and move ) to move linguistic entities into such configurations .",
    "the notion of `` incomplete dependency '' adopted in most processing models derives from a fundamentally resource based view of language .",
    "a dependency is a producer - consumer pair , and it is `` incomplete '' at a point in a left to right analysis if exactly one member of the pair has been encountered in the portion of the input string seen so far .",
    "for example , at the point marked ` ' in the simple transitive sentence ( [ e : trans ] ) the verb - object dependency is incomplete , since the consumer resource ( i.e. , the verb ) has been encountered but the producer resource ( the object noun phrase ) has not .",
    "recent work in logic has established a general framework in which various kinds of resource sensitivity can be formalized and studied .",
    "this section informally sketches some of the key ideas , but the reader should see @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) for a more thorough introduction to this material .",
    "linguistic entities are classified into _",
    "types _ , which encode their combinatory capability .",
    "for example , the noun phrase _",
    "kim _ might be assigned the type @xmath0 , and a verb phrase _",
    "snores _ might be assigned the type @xmath1 , indicating that it consumes a resource of type @xmath0 to produce an object of type @xmath2 .",
    "these types also indicate the _ type _ of semantic interpretation associated with these phrases : e.g. , the verb phrase is a function from @xmath0 meanings to @xmath2 meanings .",
    "resource logics differ in terms of the kinds of _ structural sensitivity _ they enforce .",
    "for example , a grammar consisting solely of a resource logic ( e.g. , lambek categorial grammar ) needs to be sensitive to the positions of linguistic entities in the sentence .",
    "in such a grammar the location of the argument with respect to the functor needs to be specified , so the undirected implication ` @xmath3 ' is specialized into a leftward looking version ` @xmath4 ' and a rightward looking version ` @xmath5 ' .",
    "for example , a transitive verb such as _ touches _ might be of type @xmath6 , i.e. , an entity which consumes an @xmath0 to its right ( the object noun phrase ) and then consumes an @xmath0 to its left ( its subject ) to produce a saturated sentence .",
    "directional sensitivity is one dimension of structural sensitivity . in general , the more linguistic detail a resource logic is called upon to account for , the more refined its type system needs to be . because the domain of locality of linguistic relationships may vary ( e.g. , head - complement dependencies are more local than  dependencies )",
    ", different types may need to be associated with different structural sensitivities .",
    "a general framework of multimodal substructural logics has been developed for formalizing and investigating these interactions @xcite .",
    "a proof in a resource logic specifies a `` plugging '' , i.e. , it identifies which objects fill the requirements of which other objects @xcite .",
    "these dependencies or pluggings determine the semantic interpretation of the utterance ; e.g. , via the curry - howard correspondence between ( intuitionistic ) proofs and @xmath7-terms @xcite .",
    "the job of a grammar is to specify just which pluggings can occur in a particular human language , and sophisticated resource logics have been developed just for this purpose , as mentioned above .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper it is not necessary to exactly identify the constraints on grammatical pluggings : indeed , one of the strengths of a dependency based approach is that it does not depend on the precise details of the particular linguistic theory involved .",
    "rather , it suffices that we can determine the pluggings which have actually occured in the particular sentences being studied .",
    "these pluggings can usually be deduced from fairly general linguistic assumptions ( e.g. , about the valence of verbs ) and the interpretation of the sentences themselves ( which must reflect their pluggings , via the curry - howard correspondence ) .    to keep things simple , all the examples in this paper use lambek categorial grammar .",
    "this grammatical framework , while sufficient to describe the examples presented here , is incapable of describing many other important constructions that appear in natural languages .",
    "more sophisticated grammatical frameworks , such as the multi - modal systems described @xcite ( @xcite ) and @xcite ( @xcite ) , can account for a much wider set of natural language examples .",
    "however , as the interested reader can confirm , the observations presented here about the complexity of particular examples also hold in these more complex systems ( as they must , since these more sophisticated grammars assume the same pluggings as presented here ) .",
    "proof nets are graphic depictions of proofs , i.e. , of the dependencies or plugging relationships between entities . in the application",
    "described here it is necessary to systematically distinguish the inputs to the combinatory process ( the lexical items ) from the single output produced from these inputs ( the completed sentence ) .",
    "one way to do this is to use an intuitionistic logic , and to use proof nets in which the edges are directed .",
    "a proof net is a directed graph composed of proof net connectives .",
    "the edges of the proof nets used here are directed ( as the logic is intuitionistic ) and each edge is labelled with a type .",
    "a proof net must satisfy structural conditions which depend on the kind of structural sensitivity imposed by the logic .",
    "proof nets for lambek categorial grammars must satisfy ( among other constraints ) a planarity condition @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) describes in detail the structural conditions that correspond to the more general class of multimodal resource logics . however , as explained above the work presented here requires us only to identify the proof nets associated with particular examples , and does not depend directly on the general structural constraints themselves , so they are not presented here .",
    "the first two columns of figure  [ f : pn ] lists the proof net connectives used in the examples here , and the third column lists the corresponding linear logic proof net connective for readers familiar with linear logic .",
    "we permit two kinds of axiom links .",
    "in addition to the identity axiom ( the wire permitting an @xmath8 phrase to plug an @xmath8 requirement ) we have a non - logical axiom permitting a  phrase to plug an requirement , and will indicate its use with a dashed line .",
    "( this distinction is one that any realistic grammar will have to make , as  and  dependencies exhibit different structural constraints , even though we do not make use of that fact here ) .",
    "the proof net connectives decompose the types associated with lexical entries into the resources that they produce and consume , so each lexical entry can be regarded as a partial proof net with incoming and outgoing edges labelled with atomic categories .",
    "these unpacked lexical entries are connected with other words and phrases by axiom links .",
    "the axiom links identify the _ dependencies _ between the lexical item and its surrounding material , so the unsatisfied dependencies at any point in processing are precisely the axiom links that must be cut in order to disconnect the proof net at the point of the cut.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    we end this section with some examples .",
    "figure  [ f : trans ] shows the proof net for the simple transitive sentence _",
    "kim admires sandy_. the vertical bars indicate cuts made between the words in this sentence .",
    "each cut partitions the words or input resources into two groups , corresponding to words received at some point of time in processing the input .",
    "incremental processing in this framework corresponds to the assumption that the input seen so far is integrated as much as is possible , but the axiom links crossing a cut must be disconnected at the point of time corresponding to that cut because the resources they connect to have not yet been received .",
    "in example  [ f : trans ] exactly one axiom link crosses each cut , so there is exactly one unsatisfied  dependency at each of these locations .",
    "figure  [ f : who ] shows the partial proof net associated with a relative pronoun .",
    "the analysis of relative clauses used here is simplified , and makes obviously incorrect linguistic predictions .",
    "it only permits peripheral s to be `` extracted '' , and does not respect syntactic `` island '' constraints .",
    "s are treated as atomic units in this paper , so relative clauses are analysed as modifiers .",
    "thus a relative pronoun is analysed as something which provides a  resource to its right and consumes the   that it appears in .",
    "it also consumes an  to its left and produces a new , i.e. , it functions as an  modifier .",
    "these simplifications do not affect the analysis of the examples presented in this paper , but clearly if other constructions were to be analysed ( such as medial extraction ) a more sophisticated grammar would be required . @xcite ( @xcite ) presents a detailed fragment based on a multi - modal logic which permits clause medial extraction and accounts for syntactic island phenomena .",
    "his grammar assigns a single type to relative pronouns , rather than the two types used here .",
    "however , his grammar assigns proof structures to the examples presented in this paper with the same general topological features as the ones presented here , and the interested reader can confirm that the complexity differences presented below hold in his system as well .",
    "with the formal tools of proof nets now available , it is relatively simple to express many dependency - based theories of human sentence processing complexity as geometric constraints on proof nets .    first , consider the iterated object relative clauses shown in ( [ e : objrel ] ) , which are usually described as right - branching constructions . while increased length does reduce acceptability ,",
    "there does not seem to be any significant processing overload associated with such examples .",
    "figure  [ f : right - embedding ] depicts the proof net for ( [ e : objrela ] ) . for simplicity in this proof net the passivised forms _ was cured by _ and _ was administered by _ are treated as transitive verbs , rather than being analysed into their component lexical items . at most 2  axiom links",
    "cross any cut in the proof nets for these examples ( either two  links or an  and a link , depending on where the cut lies ) , which is consistent with processing complexity being independent of the number of such constructions involved .    now consider the iterated subject relative clauses shown in ( [ e : subjrel ] ) , which are classic examples of center - embedded constructions .",
    "in contrast to the object relative clauses in ( [ e : objrel ] ) , two or more levels of embedding renders the example virtually incomprehensible .",
    "figure  [ f : rc - subj ] depicts the proof net for ( [ e : subjrela ] ) .",
    "the maximal cut in the constructions ( [ e : subjrel ] ) occurs just after the most embedded subject . at depth of embedding @xmath9",
    "the maximal cut crosses @xmath10 axiom links .",
    "the assumption that the human language processor can only keep track of a small number of such incomplete dependencies accounts for the increasing ill - formedness as the number of such constructions increases .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that subject complement clauses such as ( [ e : sentsubj ] ) are easier to comprehend than corresponding subject relatives @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : sentsubj ] depicts the proof net for ( [ e : sentsubj ] ) .",
    "the maximal cut for this example crosses one less axiom link than the corresponding relative clause example ( [ e : subjrela ] ) , which is consistent with this putative difference .",
    "thus far processing complexity seems proportional to the number of axiom links crossed by a maximal cut .",
    "the examples ( [ e : gibson ] ) , reprinted here as ( [ e : gibsonb ] ) , suggest that the matter is more delicate .",
    "proof nets for these examples are schematically depicted in figures  [ f : scrc ] and  [ f : rcsc ] ( only links crossed by the maximal cut are shown ) .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) present a hypothesis that accounts for this difference in acceptability which is expressed in terms of the internal states of an unspecified automaton that constructs a parse tree .",
    "they hypothesise that the human sentence processor overloads very quickly when it predicts a category whose features are subsumed by the features of one of the categories it is currently in the process of completing . in their approach a relative clause introduces a prediction for an ",
    "node with a  feature , while a sentential complement introduces a prediction for an ",
    "node without a feature .",
    "they propose that prediction for an ",
    "node without a feature is subsumed by a prediction for an ",
    "node with a  feature , so only ( [ e : rcscb ] ) requires the introduction of a prediction that is subsumed by the features of a category currently being parsed .",
    "this paper does not attempt to empirically evaluate this hypothesis , but merely points out that in the context of the current examples , this hypothesis can be restated as a constraint on the sequence of axiom links crossed by any cut in the proof net .",
    "to see this , note that @xcite ( @xcite ) s category predictions correspond to leftward - pointing axiom links in a proof net .",
    "thus there are two  predictions at the locations of maximal cut complexity in the proof nets in figures  [ f : scrc ] and  [ f : rcsc ]",
    ".    we could directly encode @xcite ( @xcite ) s proposal in a proof net system by enriching the   type with  features ( possibly inherited via some percolation mechanism , as they suggest ) : in proof net terms their hypothesis would be that the human sentence processor overloads if a leftward pointing axiom link is embedded within another leftward pointing axiom link labelled with a subsuming type .",
    "however , because -dependencies appear in the proof nets used here it is not necessary to enrich the ",
    "type with  features , as the relevant ",
    "axiom links are easily identified geometrically in the proof net ( they are the ones introduced by expansion of a @xmath11 type ) . in the proof nets depicted in figures  [ f : scrc ] and",
    "[ f : rcsc ] they are the   axiom links adjacent to a  axiom link .",
    "the previous section has shown that theories of processing stated in terms of incomplete dependencies can often be restated as geometric constraints on proof nets .",
    "such constraints would be more plausible if they can be shown to arise naturally from independently required mechanisms or processes , such as incremental semantic interpretation .    as is well - known , one of the major attractions of resource logic accounts of natural language is that the syntax - semantics interface can take a particularly simple form , as the curry - howard correspondence pairs each syntactic operation with a corresponding semantic counterpart .",
    "the idea explored in this section is basically as before : we divide the utterance into two parts , and examine the complexity the structural relationships between those parts . in the previous sections we examined a syntactic measure of complexity  the number of incomplete dependencies  and argued that proof nets provide a suitable structure for investigating these dependencies . in this section",
    "we investigate the complexity of the semantic interpretations of the sequence of prefixes encountered as the sentence is heard and processed .",
    "strong incremental interpretation requires that every prefix of a sentence form a single semantic entity .",
    "take linguistic objects to be pairs @xmath12 of a type @xmath13 and a @xmath7-term @xmath14 of type @xmath13 , and let @xmath15 be a string of lexical type/@xmath7-term pairs with an interpretation @xmath16 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath17 then an _ incremental interpretation _ of the prefix @xmath18 is an _ interpolant _ @xmath12 that satisfies the pair of constraints : @xmath19 for many resource logics , including , it is possible to prove that such incremental interpretations always exist , i.e. , if @xmath15 has an interpretation then @xmath18 has an incremental interpretation .",
    "a natural question to ask is if there is any relationship between the interpolants that function as incremental interpretations and the proof net cuts used in the accounts of center embedding processing complexity .",
    "unfortunately , the relationship between cut set size and the complexity of the interpolant is not straight - forward , because the interpolant complexity can vary depending on the details of the logic .",
    "define the complexity of a type as one plus the number of binary connectives appearing in it ( thus @xmath20 has complexity 3 ) .",
    "then the complexity of an interpolant is never less than the number of axiom links crossed by the corresponding cut , since the number of atomic links constructed by expanding the interpolant using proof net connectives is given by the interpolant s complexity .    on the other hand",
    ", the minimum complexity of an interpolant may be greater than the number of atomic links crossed by a minimal cut .",
    "for example , consider the sequence of   types corresponding to a transitive clause in a sov language . @xmath21 the minimal cut at ` ' in a proof net for ( [ e : sov ] ) crosses two  axiom links .",
    "however , the smallest  interpolant at ` ' is @xmath22 which has complexity 4 .",
    "interestingly , this difference disappears if we enrich s type with product ` @xmath23 ' , with pair formation ` @xmath24 ' as the corresponding semantic operation . with this extension",
    "the minimal interpolant is @xmath25 which corresponds directly to the axioms crossed by the minimal cut .",
    "thus the presence of an additional logical connective , in this case ` @xmath23 ' , can alter the interpolant complexity , even if that connective is not used in the grammar itself .",
    "thus interpolant complexity depends on features of the logic used .",
    "this paper has shown that proof nets provide a suitable formalization of the notion of `` incomplete dependency '' used in many accounts of processing complexity .",
    "the structure of a proof net for a sentence relevant for the complexity metrics discussed in this paper is usually fixed by its meaning and standard linguistic assumptions about the types of the words involved , so the results obtained do not depend crucially on any particular linguistic theory",
    ". more sophisticated models of processing , such as @xcite ( @xcite ) , appeal to the arrangement of embedding relationships in a sentence .",
    "the grapical nature of proof nets makes it simple to express such theories in this framework .",
    "the last section of this paper investigated the relationship between the incomplete dependencies expressed by proof nets and the complexity of the types of incremental semantic interpretations .",
    "however , it seems that the complexity of the interpolants involved in incremental interpretation depend crucially on the details of the logic used to represent these interpolants .",
