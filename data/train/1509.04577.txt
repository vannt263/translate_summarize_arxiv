    "since there is no known fundamental principle requiring spacetime to be @xmath3dimensional @xcite , our observable universe might be a @xmath4dimensional brane in a higher dimensional bulk @xcite .",
    "most models suggest that there are one or more flat 3-branes embedded discontinuously in the ambient geometry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , almost all of the extra - dimensional models require the existence of scalar fields , for instance , to generate a domain - wall which localizes matter fields @xcite .",
    "scalar fields serve to stabilize the size of the compact extra dimensions@xcite , and can support the modification of the randall - sundrum warped - space @xcite to a smoothed - out version @xcite , or to cut off the extra dimension at a singularity @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the nonlinearity in the scalar field and , in particular , the existence of disconnected vacuua in the self - interaction of the scalar field lead to the appearance of a stable localized solution , which is a good motivation for building thick brane models @xcite . it is frequently invoked to replace an infinitely thin brane with a thick one , by supposing a scalar field with soliton behavior .",
    "based on this point of view , in this paper we investigate diverse models , namely , the sine - gordon ( sg ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 brane models which have broken @xmath2 symmetry in some cases . note that the @xmath2 symmetry may be restored by a proper choice of model parameters .",
    "the origin of symmetry breaking in our models reside in the fact that the modified scalar field potential may have non - degenerate vacuua @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant on both sides of the brane are determine by these vacuua .",
    "we consider a thick brane , embedded in a five - dimensional ( 5d ) bulk spacetime , modelled by the following action : @xmath5.\\ ] ] the simplest line element of the brane , embedded in the five - dimensional bulk space - time can be written as@xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the warp factor which depends only on the 5d coordinate @xmath8 .",
    "the 5d gravitational and scalar field equations take respectively the following forms @xmath9 ,       \\\\",
    "6{a^{\\prime}}^{2}&=&\\kappa_{5}^{2}t_{44}=\\kappa_{5}^{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}{\\varphi^{\\prime}}^{2}-v(\\varphi)\\right ] ,       \\\\",
    "\\varphi^{\\prime\\prime}+4a^{\\prime}\\varphi^{\\prime}&=&\\frac{d v(\\varphi)}{d\\varphi},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "in order to obtain the first - order equation , one can introduce the auxiliary function @xmath10 in such a way that : @xmath11 while @xmath12 achieves the special form @xcite : @xmath13 moreover , it may be instructive to calculate the geodesic equation along the fifth dimension in a thick brane , in order to investigate the particle motion near the brane @xcite . to this end ,",
    "we start with the geodesic equation : @xmath14 which leads to * @xmath15 * where @xmath16 is a constant of integration and the function @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18",
    "first we consider the sine - gordon ( sg ) system , where the self - interaction potential of this model reads : @xmath19\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are free parameters of the model .",
    "the sg system has the following exact static kink solution @xcite : @xmath22 which is plotted in fig.[st](a ) , for various values of parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which correspond to branes with different thickness .",
    "when considered as the brane potential , however , this potential should be modified to become consistent with the einstein equations .",
    "the corresponding potential for this model is given by : @xmath23^{2}\\ , ,    \\label{sgpotential}\\ ] ] which is depicted in fig.[v](a ) .",
    "notice that this potential has two series of non - degenerate vacuua , as in the dsg ( double sine - gordon ) system potential @xcite .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath24 these vacuua tend to the same value ( become degenerate ) , such as the potentials used in @xcite .",
    "in this case the energy density is localized at the brane and the thickness of the latter is @xmath25 it can be seen that there is no singularity in the ricci scalar and/or kretschmann scalar . moreover , in the limits of @xmath26 , the ricci scalar and all the components of the einstein in the right and left sides of the brane are different ( fig.[gw](a ) ) .",
    "however , in the limit of @xmath27 , the einstein tensor is given by @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) , and one can interpret it as the cosmological constant on the brane , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , we have a broken @xmath2-symmetry in the bulk , as the two sides of the brane differ completely . on the right and in the limit of @xmath31 ,",
    "the einstein tensor and consequently the cosmological constant of the bulk vanish , so the bulk is asymptotically minkowski .",
    "however , on the other side of the brane , these quantities are nonzero and equal to the constant value @xmath32 , and as a result the bulk would be de sitter .",
    "besides , by checking the geodesic equation of a test particle moving only in the direction of the extra dimension , the confining effect of the scalar field is proved .",
    "= 13.2 cm    the second brane model is the @xmath0-based model , for which we have @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants .",
    "the kink solution reads @xmath36 which is depicted in fig.[st](b ) .",
    "the potential is obtained as @xmath37 which is plotted in fig.[v](b ) and the brane thickness becomes @xmath38 . as for the previous sg model , we determine the limits @xmath26 for all the components of the einstein tensor components , which are the same at different sides and given by @xmath39 ( fig.[gw](b ) ) and in the limit of @xmath27 the einstein tensor components ( for @xmath29 ) takes the form @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , in this model the cosmological constant on the brane @xmath41 would be @xmath42 .",
    "for this model a test particle oscillate around the brane by @xmath43 .",
    "= 13.6 cm    the last model is based on the @xmath1 soliton .",
    "for this model , we have the following potential : @xmath44 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constant(as in the @xmath0 model ) and as a result , the kink solution is given by @xcite : @xmath45 the kink solution is depicted in fig.[st](c ) .",
    "thus , for the @xmath1 system the self - interaction potential takes the form ( fig.[v](c ) ) : @xmath46 the thickness of this brane is given by @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , for this model and in the limit of @xmath48 the mixed einstein tensor components reduce to @xmath49 and zero respectively see fig.[gw](c ) .",
    "and in the limit of @xmath27 , the einstein tensor is @xmath50 .",
    "in this work , we obtained exact thick brane models inspired by well - known nonlinear systems , namely , the sine - gordon ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1 models . the confining effect of the scalar field in all these three models were confirmed by examining the geodesic equation for a test particle moving normal to the brane . in particular , it turns out that the modified potential for the @xmath51 system resembles that of the double sine - gordon ( @xmath52 ) system , while those of @xmath0 and @xmath1 became @xmath1 and @xmath53 , respectively . in the case of the @xmath51 model , the resulting brane does not have @xmath54 symmetry , in general , where the center of the brane may be displaced from @xmath55 and the potential will not be an odd function of @xmath8 in general . however , by a suitable choice of the model parameters it is possible to make the vacuua of the effective potential degenerate , in which case the @xmath54 symmetry is restored . in the case of the @xmath56 model ,",
    "however , we could not restore this symmetry via re - parametrization .",
