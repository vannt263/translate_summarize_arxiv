    "ultracold atoms , tuned with feshbach resonance , offer a great opportunity to study strongly correlated many - body physics in a controlled fashion .",
    "for such strongly interacting systems , in general there is no well - controlled approximation method to solve the many - body physics .",
    "exact solution of few - body problems plays an important role in understanding the corresponding many - body systems .",
    "few - body ( three- or four - body ) problems have been solved for strongly interacting bosons or fermions in free space @xcite , in a quasi - one - dimensional configuration @xcite , and in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) harmonic trap for bosons @xcite or fermions in the unitary limit @xcite .    in this paper , we add to this sort of examples by exactly solving the three - body problem for strongly interacting two - component fermions in a 3d harmonic trap across resonance .",
    "this work has two main motivations : firstly , the situation considered here is relevant for experiments where one loads strongly interacting two component fermions into a deep 3d optical lattice @xcite .",
    "for each site that can be approximated with a harmonic potential , one could have two identical fermions ( spin-@xmath0 ) strongly interacting with another distinct fermion ( spin-@xmath1 ) .",
    "the three - body problem for equal mass fermions turns out to be very different from the corresponding case for bosons . instead of a hierarchy of bound efimov states for bosons @xcite ,",
    "we show that there is always a significant energy penalty for three fermions to occupy the same lattice site ( @xmath2 ) instead of two ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result justifies an important assumption made in the derivation of an effective many - body hamiltonian for this system @xcite .",
    "secondly , we analyze the ground - state structure of the three - body problem and show that as one scans the 3d scattering length , there is a level crossing between the lowest - lying three - fermion energy eigenstates , which have _ s_- or _",
    "p_-wave symmetries respectively in the limit as two atoms are contracted to form a dimer .",
    "this level crossing with a symmetry change may correspond a quantum phase transition in the many - body case where one has spin - polarized fermi gas loaded into an optical lattice .",
    "the latter system with polarized fermions has raised strong interest recently in both theory and experiments @xcite .",
    "the method here is based on manipulation of a lippmann - schwinger equation for the wavefunction , with the formalism similar to the one presented in ref .",
    "as is standard , we separate the center - of - mass degree of freedom via an orthogonal transformation of variables , leaving the trapping potential diagonal in the new coordinates .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the relative degrees of freedom is then @xmath4 \\psi \\left ( \\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\right )   \\\\",

    "we approximate the short - range interaction between fermions with the usual zero - range pseudopotential @xcite @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the 3d s - wave scattering length tunable through the feshbach resonance .",
    "the above contact interaction is equivalent to imposing boundary conditions @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 are proportional to the distances between the center of mass of an @xmath17 pair and an @xmath0 fermion .",
    "the overall @xmath18 sign ensures the antisymmetry of the wavefunction upon swapping the identical fermions .",
    "the undetermined function @xmath19 , after a rescaling of the argument , is the relative atom - dimer wavefunction that results when two of the fermions form a tightly bound pair . solving for this asymptotic wavefunction @xmath20 fully determines @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath22 only acts at @xmath23 , we use the asymptotic form of @xmath24 when computing @xmath25 .",
    "the formal solution can then be written as @xmath26 where the two - particle green s function is given by @xmath27 the @xmath28 are the single - particle eigenfunctions with eigenenergies @xmath29 for the reduced mass @xmath30 . here",
    "we use spherical coordinates for the three - dimensional harmonic trap , so the quantum numbers are @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ; @xmath34 .",
    "the eigenenergies are @xmath35 and the eigenfunctions are @xmath36 , where the @xmath37 are the standard spherical harmonics",
    ". the radial wavefunction is given by @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the length scale of the trap and the @xmath40 are associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "we can make use of the invariance of @xmath41 and the integration measure under an orthogonal transformation of variables to rewrite eq . in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we can also decompose the asymptotic atom - dimer wavefunction in terms of the complete set of single - particle wavefunctions , @xmath45 .",

    "we anticipate that the low - energy physics should be contained in a truncated hilbert space containing only the lowest few asymptotic atom - dimer energy levels .",
    "is easily solved numerically .",
    "we have checked that , indeed , the solution for the ground state and the first excited manifold become insensitive to the cutoff , as long as the first four or five atom - dimer energy levels are included . for all results presented in this paper ,",
    "we have kept the first five energy levels . because of the degeneracy of the excited levels , eq .",
    "becomes a @xmath56 matrix equation . for a given energy ,",
    "we solve numerically to obtain the corresponding scattering length and eigenstate . by sweeping through a range of energies , we map out the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsa ] . at unitarity",
    ", our result for the low - energy spectrum agrees with the analytic result of ref .",
    "@xcite . upon careful inspection",
    ", one can discern the presence of level crossings .",
    "more usefully , in fig . [",
    "fig : ediff ] we display the difference between the energy of three fermions in a single lattice site and the energy of two fermions ( @xmath17 ) in the site and the extra fermion alone in a separate site . here",
    "we have used the well - known exact solution for the two - body energy @xmath57 @xcite , @xmath58    figure [ fig : ediff ] is our main result .",
    "there are two main features we would like to point out .",
    "first , it is clear that it is energetically favorable for atoms in a lattice to arrange themselves such that there are less than three atoms per site , regardless of the scattering length .",
    "this has already been assumed in the derivation of an effective many - body hamiltonian for atoms in an optical lattice across a feshbach resonance @xcite , and is confirmed by fig .",
    "[ fig : ediff ] .",
    "second , the level crossing in the ground state is now quite evident . on the positive scattering length side of the crossing ( the bec side , where the many - body system forms a bose - einstein condensate of bound dimers ) , the ground state is nondegenerate . on the other side ( the bcs side , where the many - body system forms a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer superfluid of atomic cooper pairs ) , it is triply degenerate .",
    "other crossings appear in the excited spectrum , although to obtain quantitatively accurate results for these one should include higher modes when solving eq . .",
    "the origin of the level crossing is the differing symmetries of the eigenstates .",
    "for very small , positive scattering length ( deep bec side ) , formation of tightly bound dimers is favorable , so the state should behave as the ground state of the relative atom - dimer motion , which has s - wave symmetry .",
    "for very small , negative scattering length ( deep bcs side ) , the atoms are essentially non - interacting , so the ground state comprises two atoms ( @xmath17 ) in the ground state of the trap plus the third in the first excited state of the trap ( which is triply degenerate ) because of pauli exclusion .",
    "so , on the deep bcs side , the ground state has p - wave symmetry . due to the rotational symmetry of a spherical harmonic trap",
    ", the total angular momentum of the three particles should be a conserved quantity .",
    "however , from the above analysis , this quantity has different values for the ground state in the deep bec and deep bcs limits .",
    "therefore , there must be a ground - state level crossing for this system as one scans the scattering length .",
    "if one considers multiple lattice sites with each site having on average two spin @xmath0 and one spin @xmath1 atoms ( which could be realized with polarized fermions in an optical lattice with appropriate filling number and population imbalance ) , as the three - body problem has a level crossing with different ground state degeneracies in the bcs and the bec limits , there could be a corresponding quantum phase transition for this many - body system ( with small tunneling between lattice sites ) as one scans the scattering length .",
    "the wavefunction given in eq , does not generally have definite _ relative _ angular momentum for any two fermions .",
    "however , in the limit as the distance between two distinguishable fermions goes to zero , the wavefunction takes on the symmetry of the asymptotic atom - dimer wavefunction in the remaining coordinates .",
    "this is a relative angular momentum eigenstate due to the spherical symmetry of the limiting case . with the relative coordinates defined by fig .",
    "[ fig : vars ] , the symmetry of the wavefunction as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the limit as @xmath61 goes to zero is shown by fig . [",
    "fig : sym ] . for finite @xmath61 ,",
    "the @xmath62 wavefunctions are affected by the asymmetry and take nontrivial shapes .",
    "we have plotted an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] .",
    "note that in this figure we include a factor of @xmath63 since the wavefunction itself diverges at @xmath64 , @xmath65 according to the boundary conditions we have imposed . on the bec side , the lobes are tightly bunched near @xmath66 , but on the bcs side they spread around as expected .    in general ,",
    "the eigenstates are rather difficult to visualize , since they depend nontrivially on three spatial variables as well as the scattering length .",
    "however , one can get some idea of the evolution of the eigenstates from fig . [",
    "fig : dists ] , which shows the normalized probability density as a function of the variables introduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : vars ] for various scattering lengths . in each subplot",
    "we have numerically integrated over the other two variables to obtain a one - dimensional function .",
    "the dimer size , @xmath61 , clearly decreases in size as one enters the bec regime , developing a strong peak at the origin .",
    "however , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : vars ] , there are two ways to form a tightly bound dimer ( due to the two identical spin @xmath0 atoms ) and we have arbitrarily chosen one to define the origin @xmath67 .",
    "so it is not surprising that we see a more diffuse second peak at large distance @xmath61 , corresponding to the dimer forming between the spin @xmath68 and the other spin @xmath0 atom .",
    "this is also the meaning of the spike at @xmath66 on the bec side .",
    "we have found the low - lying energy levels of three fermions in a harmonic trap and examined the corresponding wavefunctions .",
    "the ground state has s - wave symmetry on the bec side of feshbach resonance and has p - wave symmetry on the bcs side . in the resonance region",
    "there is a level crossing , which may indicate a phase transition in the corresponding many - body case .",
    "we also note that , in the vicinity of resonance , the energy of three atoms in a single site is greater than their energy if they are in two sites , with a gap on the order of the trap spacing , validating the approximation in ref @xcite ."
