    "recent advances in materials technology have led to the emergence of a new branch of science , the physics of metamaterials .",
    "these are artificially engineered composites that exhibit properties unattainable in nature and furnish exciting potential new tools for future technologies  @xcite .",
    "electrodynamics of metamaterials has opened avenues for manipulating light in unforeseen ways , as well as presented new paradigms in basic science  @xcite .",
    "metamaterials exhibiting negative refractive index within certain frequency ranges  @xcite provide a particularly promising example , as they give rise to a number of unusual optical properties impossible to observe in natural materials .",
    "in addition to negative refraction , i.e. , reverse snell s law  @xcite , these properties include perfect lensing  @xcite , reverse doppler shift  @xcite , reverse cherenkov radiation  @xcite , and , in particular , phase and group velocities pointing in the opposite directions  @xcite .",
    "negative refractive index was first studied as a purely hypothetical concept and analyzed using simple mathematical models  @xcite .",
    "only relatively recently was this concept realized experimentally using metamaterials , first for microwaves  @xcite , and subsequently for infrared and visible light  @xcite .",
    "nonlinearity in the interaction of light with metamaterials can arise both from the host material and/or from the embedded structures  @xcite .",
    "particularly intriguing situations arise on the boundaries of negative- and positive - refractive - index regimes in metamaterials , be it in the physical or the frequency domain .",
    "the former include , for example , nonlinear optical vortices  @xcite and bistability  @xcite .",
    "for the latter , let us recall that negative refractive index exists only inside limited frequency ranges , while outside these ranges the refractive index is positive .",
    "nonlinearity can facilitate energy interchange among different frequency components of optical pulses traveling through a nonlinear metamaterial .",
    "two possible scenarios can occur : pulses with broad spectra whose wings belong to regions of different refractive - index sign , or multi - wave interaction in which the individual wave frequencies belong to such regions  @xcite .",
    "one way to achieve this latter scenario is to dope a metamaterial with active atoms , and launch into this metamaterial two - color light pulses that resonate with two atomic transitions from a pair of energetically - lower level to a common upper level , with one transition frequency lying in the regime of positive and the other in the regime of negative refraction .",
    "this transition configuration is known as the @xmath0 configuration  @xcite .",
    "likewise , in a chiral metamaterial  @xcite , the opposite circular polarizations of a monochromatic light pulse that travel in the opposite regimes of the refractive - index sign can be coupled via the interaction with active atoms through a pair of transitions in the @xmath0 configuration .    in this paper",
    ", we study two - color light pulses propagating through metamaterials containing embedded active atoms with two electron transitions in the @xmath0 configuration , corresponding to the two colors , for which one transition frequency lies in the positive - refraction and the other in the negative - refraction regime .",
    "this physical setup provides a perfect example of nonlinear interaction between wave pairs propagating within the two refraction regimes in the metamaterial .",
    "since the group velocities of such wave pairs have the opposite signs , it is not surprising to find that resonantly - interacting waves typically travel in the opposite directions .",
    "this unusual interaction gives rise to a number of effects .",
    "the first effect we find is self - trapping , resulting in a pair of co - propagating solitary - wave - type pulses similar to the self - trapped pulses in metamaterials exhibiting second - harmonic generation  @xcite .",
    "the second effect is the counter - propagation of the linear waves shed by the incident pulse , traveling at the two respective carrier frequencies .",
    "the third effect is the stopping of a pulse as it switches energy from one color to the other , accompanied by a hot spot of medium excitation left in the metamaterial at the location of the color switching and direction reversal .",
    "several known mechanisms currently exist that produce a negative refractive index , such as chirality  @xcite , hyperbolic materials  @xcite , and metamaterials based on the magnetic response utilizing plasmonic resonance  @xcite .",
    "all these approaches yield the same ultimate effect , and so , with no loss of generality , we here focus on the last one .",
    "we begin with maxwell s equations for the electric and magnetic fields , coupled to material equations describing the magnetic and dielectric response of the nanostructures and the additional response of the active atoms in the @xmath0 configuration .",
    "we restrict our study to coherent phenomena , i.e. , the case in which pulses are very short compared to all the relaxation time scales . under the assumption that light pulses are short , but still much longer than the individual wavelengths of the light they contain , we have derived a set of maxwell - bloch equations that describe the electric - field envelopes and the medium polarizations and level - occupation densities . while we only consider idealized , lossless propagation , our equations can be readily adapted to include terms describing losses and pumping .",
    "this is important because metamaterials are quite lossy , especially in the negative - refraction frequency range , and doping them with active atoms has in fact been used to successfully reduce these losses  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mainmod ] we present our modeling assumptions and state the basic physical model that we adopt for our investigation .",

    "to set the stage for our numerical investigation , in this section , we briefly outline a derivation of the envelope equations that describe the propagation of optical pulses in a @xmath0-configuration metamaterial with embedded nano - inclusions .",
    "ultimately , we will assume our model to describe a metamaterial fabricated in such a way that one of the two allowed atomic - transition frequencies takes place in a regime of negative refractive index and the other transition frequency in a regime of positive refractive index .",
    "our goal is to investigate the interaction among waves propagating in the two regimes , and the resulting dynamical phenomena emerging from this interaction .",
