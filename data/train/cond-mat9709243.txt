    "the remarkably rich zero temperature phase diagram of a two - dimensional electron gas in a high magnetic field  @xcite offers an ideal laboratory for exploring the physics of systems near a quantum critical point .",
    "much theoretical and experimental attention has focussed on the transitions between the various quantum hall plateau states and the insulator  @xcite",
    ".    the vast majority of the theoretical work has studied transitions between integer quantum hall plateaus using a model of non - interacting electrons undergoing phase - coherent transport in the presence of a random potential  @xcite : this transport can be described by non - linear sigma model field theories  @xcite or by a network model  @xcite . in this scenario , interactions only provide a phase - breaking length which cuts off the critical quantum interference effects , but are irrelevant perturbations at the quantum - critical point .",
    "it has also been suggested that the transitions involving fractional quantum hall plateaus can be described using closely related models of non - interacting composite fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , there have been a number of indications in recent experiments that interactions play a more fundamental role  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the non - linear transport  @xcite have allowed direction measurement of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath6 : the measured value @xmath7 is incompatible with critical points of non - interacting electrons , but can possibly be understood to be a consequence of the coulomb repulsion at an interacting critical point  @xcite . a more direct indication of the importance comes from measurements of frequency dependent transport .",
    "it was found that the width of transition region between the plateaus scales with the same power of frequency , @xmath2 , and temperature , @xmath8  @xcite : such a property only holds at quantum transitions described by a fixed point with non - zero interactions , while non - interacting fixed points with irrelevant interactions have very different sensitivities to perturbations in @xmath2 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "non - zero temperature transport near interacting quantum critical points in two dimensions was studied by damle and author in a previous paper  @xcite ( hereafter referred to as i ) .",
    "a number of general observations were made , supported by an explicit calculation on the superfluid - insulator transition in a mott - hubbard model for bosons .",
    "in particular , it was argued that the conductivity at the critical point was given by @xmath9 times a non - trivial universal function of the ratio , @xmath1 .",
    "attention was drawn to the rather different physical properties of the limiting regimes of frequency and temperature : ( _ i _ ) @xmath10 with phase coherent transport of excitations created by the external electric field , and ( _ ii _ ) @xmath11 , with incoherent , quantum relaxational transport involving repeated inelastic scattering between pre - existing thermally , excited carriers , and relaxation to local equilibrium .",
    "transport is clearly in the latter regime , and it was noted in i that the d.c .",
    "conductivity was universal even though it was dominated by inelastic processes : this was possible because the cross - section for scattering between the carriers became universal at the quantum critical point .",
    "this paper will extend the considerations of i to one of the simplest possible _ interacting _ quantum critical points in a fractional quantum hall system .",
    "any experimentally realistic model must account for both the coulomb interactions among the electrons and for the external random potential .",
    "such a model is of forbidding complexity , and we shall choose here to consider non - random models in the presence of an external _ periodic _ potential with only a statistical gauge force interaction between the excitations .",
    "our choice is motivated by the desire to explore seriously the consequences of interactions in the simplest possible context , and the arguments above that inelastic , incoherent processes are essential to any analysis of the experimentally observed critical properties .",
    "the absence of a random potential means that there are no localized states : these are essential for the appearance of quantum hall plateaus as a function of the external magnetic field , as they appear when the fermi level is in a region of localized states .",
    "however , the localized states are not expected to be as crucial in the experimentally relevant critical region ( the studies of non - interacting electrons in a random potential examine the complicated physics of the divergence of the localization length at the critical point in perfectly phase coherent transport , but this is always cut off in interacting models at some finite scale due to incoherent , inelastic processes present at any non - zero temperature ) .",
    "a second motivation for examining the case of the periodic potential comes from its importance in the early studies of the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite : the topological nature of the quantization of the hall conductivity first emerged in this context .",
    "a number of earlier studies have examined the fractional quantum hall effect in a periodic potential .",
    "kol and read  @xcite examined general global criteria that must be satisfied by such states .",
    "wen and wu  @xcite and chen , fisher and wu  @xcite first examined the quantum critical points between different fractional quantum hall states and the insulator , and developed a low energy field - theoretic descriptions of the transitions .",
    "they argued that these transitions could be understood in terms of a mott transition of an anyon gas in a periodic potential and an external magnetic field .",
    "the field theory of the anyon gas consisted of a @xmath12 chern - simons gauge field coupled to either relativistic bosonic or dirac fermi fields . in an interesting recent work , pfannkuche and macdonald  @xcite",
    "have numerically shown the presence of a transition between a fractional quantum hall state and an insulator induced by varying the strength of an external periodic potential acting on an electron gas in a strong magnetic field : they also present evidence for scaling behavior in the spectrum of small systems near the critical point .",
    "this paper shall describe the nature of non - zero @xmath8 and @xmath2 transport in the @xmath12 chern - simons gauge field coupled to dirac fermi field model of chen , fisher and wu  @xcite .",
    "our motivation for chosing this particular model is mainly technical : it provides the simplest possible context for describing the physics of incoherent transport in quantum hall critical points , and allows us to keep technical details to a minimum .",
    "our results can also be extended to models of bosons coupled to a chern - simons gauge field using a @xmath13 expansion , and this will be discussed in appendix  [ largen ] .",
    "we will show that at the critical point , the longitudinal ( @xmath14 ) and hall ( @xmath15 ) conductivities obey the scaling forms @xmath16 we shall extend the quantum transport theory of i to obtain explicit expressions for the universal functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the earlier computations of these conductivities  @xcite were carried out precisely at @xmath4 , and therefore yielded the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 which describe phase - coherent transport . the d.c .",
    "conductivities are however given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 : these are quite different , but also universal numbers , characterizing incoherent , relaxational transport , and will be computed in this paper .    as many of the considerations of this paper are similar to those of i , we now explicitly point out some aspects which are different",
    ". the central focus of our analysis shall not be the conductivities @xmath23 , but related irreducible conductivities @xmath24 : these are diagrammatically defined as being irreducible towards cutting any single chern - simons gauge field propagator .",
    "we shall find that many of the issues arising in the computation of @xmath25 are similar to those discussed in i : the focus shall be on a quasiparticle - quasihole contribution which is dominated by collisions among the excitations , and is best described by a quantum transport equation .",
    "the physics going into the computation of @xmath26 is quite different .",
    "the real part of @xmath26 is non - dissipative and is actually best computed by a simple perturbation theory , which already yields a result which is an interesting function of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , such a perturbation theory was presented in ref  @xcite at @xmath4 , and here we consider the orders of limit of @xmath27 and @xmath28 more carefully .",
    "our final results for @xmath14 also has a form rather different from that obtained in i : it is given by complicated interplay between different contributions to @xmath24 : in particular we find that in the low frequency collision - dominated regime it is possible to have @xmath14 be an increasing , rather than decreasing , function of @xmath1 . for the latter situation",
    "we find that @xmath29 has a peak at @xmath30 , and eventually decreases for large enough @xmath2 .",
    "as noted above , an essential ingredient in our computation is the quantum transport equation for quasiparticles and quasiholes .",
    "these excitations are anyons , and so their scattering cross - section is singular in the forward direction : for momentum transfer @xmath31 , the cross - section @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this scattering cross - section appears in the collision term of the transport equation , and could potentially cause infrared divergences .",
    "however we shall show explicitly that the potential divergences all cancel , and the physical transport co - efficients of the anyon gas are well defined .",
    "this is an important , albeit technical , consistency check of our analysis , and occupies a significant part of section  [ qtrans ] .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows .",
    "we will introduce the model and discuss some important general issues in section  [ model ] .",
    "the perturbation theory for @xmath24 will be presented in section  [ kubo ] : this will allow us to identify the different physical contributions to @xmath24 .",
    "one of these , the quasiparticle / quasihole contribution is a delta function at zero frequency at leading order in @xmath33 .",
    "this is an artifact , and has to be repaired by an infinite order resummation : the latter is most conveniently carried out using a quantum transport equation analysis which will be discussed in section  [ qtrans ] .",
    "we will synthesize our results for @xmath24 into those for the physically observable @xmath23 in section  [ synth ] , and conclude with some general remarks in section  [ conc ] .",
    "we now make some general remarks about the nature of charge transport in chern - simons theories : these results are well known  @xcite , but our formulation is especially suited to our subsequent analysis of inelastic processes using the quantum boltzmann equation .    from the equation of motion of @xmath40 implied by @xmath52",
    ", we see that role of @xmath40 is to impose the constraint @xmath57 this constraint will be imposed _",
    "exactly _ in all stages of our analysis .",
    "the @xmath45 component of this constraint is @xmath58 where the latin indices extend over @xmath53 .",
    "the spatial components of ( [ cs2 ] ) can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ` electric field ' associated with the @xmath40 gauge field @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the electrical currents carried by the two species of dirac fermions : @xmath64 and similarly for @xmath63 .",
    "we shall be interested in the response of @xmath52 to an external physical electric field @xmath65 given , of course , by @xmath66 the currents induced by such a field , in turn , induce a non - zero value of the @xmath60 field , by ( [ cs4 ] ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to define @xmath67 as the _ total _ effective field experienced by the dirac fermions .",
    "the field @xmath68 will appear naturally in our subsequent formulation of the quantum transport equations .",
    "it is then useful to consider the response of the fermions by introducing the linear response relations @xmath69 and similarly for @xmath63 .",
    "we have also introduced a frequency @xmath2 to allow for the response to a time - dependent electric field . in diagrammatic terms , if we compute @xmath70 via a kubo formula , we should only include diagrams which are irreducible towards cutting any @xmath40 propagator : the irreducibility requirement is equivalent to considering the response to the effective field @xmath68 .    the experimentally measured response , @xmath71 , of course , relates the total current to the external electric field @xmath72 from ( [ cs4],[cs8],[cs9],[cs10 ] ) we can obtain the following basic relationship  @xcite between the response functions @xmath73    when we are well away from the critical point , @xmath74 is large , and the @xmath75 are easily computed at @xmath4 ; their exact values are  @xcite @xmath76 we see therefore that with the choices @xmath77 and @xmath78 , ( [ cs11],[cs12 ] ) lead to the conductivity ( [ fqh ] ) of the fractional quantized hall state .",
    "the system undergoes a transition to an insulator if @xmath79 changes sign while @xmath80 remains positive : then the total conductivity vanishes .",
    "the remainder of the paper will study the critical point where @xmath80 is large and positive ( and therefore the @xmath81 fermionic excitations have large gap ) while the renormalized @xmath82 at @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath83 conductivity therefore continues to satisfy ( [ cs12 ] ) at all low @xmath8 and @xmath2 ; all corrections are suppressed by factors of @xmath84 .",
    "the response of the @xmath85 fermions is much more non - trivial , and will occupy the remainder of the paper to elucidate : it has a highly non - trivial , universal function of @xmath86 . as our attention will focus solely on the response of the @xmath85 fermions , we will henceforth drop the subscript @xmath87 , and simply refer to them as the @xmath88 fermions .",
    "the central purpose of this paper is to analyze the quantum transport properties of the model @xmath52 in ( [ cs1 ] ) at @xmath89 .",
    "while the action @xmath52 is lorentz invariant , the presence of a nonzero @xmath8 breaks the lorentz symmetry , and the space and time dependence of observable correlators will be quite different .",
    "therefore , there is no particular advantage to working with a covariant gauge , and it pays to choose a gauge better suited to physics at @xmath89 .",
    "it turns out that by far the most convenient choice is the coulomb gauge : the perturbative calculations to be considered in section  [ kubo ] are the most straightforward , and the quantum transport equations of section  [ qtrans ] are readily derived in this gauge .",
    "the coulomb gauge corresponds to the choice @xmath90 combined with an exact integral of @xmath52 over @xmath91 .",
    "then the constraint ( [ cs3 ] ) can be solved to give @xmath92 where @xmath93 .",
    "note that this is an equal - time relationship  the absence of retardation in the gauge field interactions is an important simplifying feature of this gauge . inserting ( [ cs14 ] ) into ( [ cs1 ] ) ( and dropping the non - critical @xmath81 fermions )",
    "we obtain the hamiltonian density @xmath94 \\\\ h_1 & = & \\int d { { \\bf x}}\\left [ 2 \\pi \\alpha \\psi^{\\dagger } \\epsilon_{ij}\\tau_j \\psi \\frac{\\partial_i}{\\partial^2 } \\psi^{\\dagger } \\psi \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have inserted a _ bare _ mass @xmath95 in @xmath96 ; to ensure that the system is at its critical point , the value of @xmath95 will have to be adjusted order by order in @xmath33 so that the _ renormalized _ mass vanishes at @xmath4 .",
    "note that the gauge field has disappeared as an independent dynamical degree of freedom : each dirac particle / anti - particle now has a flux tube attached , and it is this flux tube which is responsible for the long - range force in @xmath97 .",
    "this economical description of the degrees of freedom will be quite useful when we consider the transport equation at nonzero temperature .",
    "the remainder of the computations in this paper will be carried out using the hamiltonian @xmath98 .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : self ] , as in the analysis for the bosonic case in i and in ref  , by an examination of the perturbative structure of the single particle self energy .",
    "then , we will proceed in sections  [ sec : sxx ] and  [ sec : sxy ] to an evaluation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 using the kubo formula .",
    "we will gain an understanding of the physically different contributions to @xmath24 by examining the structure of the bare perturbation theory in powers of @xmath33 .",
    "the results for @xmath24 will have some unphysical features which will finally be rectified by an analysis using the quantum boltzmann equation in the following section  [ qtrans ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to understand the structure of the mass renormalization in a single fermion propagator .",
    "as noted earlier , we need to adjust the value of @xmath95 so that the renormalized mass vanishes at @xmath4 .",
    "however the renormalized mass need not vanish at @xmath89 , and we will describe its universal @xmath8 dependence here .",
    "we will denote the renormalized mass by @xmath99 , and clearly we should have @xmath100 .    to leading order in @xmath33 , it turns out to be sufficient to consider evaluation of @xmath99 in a bare perturbation theory in @xmath33 , without the need for any self - consistent mass renormalization ; the latter only modify results at higher orders in @xmath33 . as @xmath95 is expected to be of order @xmath33 , we may therefore set @xmath101 within the propagators that appear in the self energy . to first order in @xmath33 ,",
    "the fermion self energy for @xmath98 is @xmath102 the trace is over the dirac spinor space , @xmath103 is a fermionic matsubara frequency , and to this order , @xmath104 is independent of the fermion frequency .",
    "evaluating the trace and performing the frequency summation , we get @xmath105 the leading @xmath106 shows that @xmath107 is precisely a mass renormalization , and therefore @xmath108 using @xmath100 , we get @xmath109 where @xmath110 is an ultraviolet momentum cutoff , whose nature we will not have to precisely specify . finally , inserting ( [ self3 ] ) and ( [ self1 ] ) into ( [ self2 ] ) we get @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the fermi function @xmath113 the integral in ( [ self4 ] )",
    "is easily evaluated , and we get our final result @xmath114 we will find later that in some cases it is necessary to include this renormalized mass in the fermion propagators , while in other cases we will simply be able to use the zeroth order result @xmath115 .      the leading contribution to @xmath25 is given by a single fermion polarization bubble , with the mass @xmath99 above included in the propagators .",
    "to first order in @xmath33 there are three additional diagrams , considered in ref  @xcite , which contribute to the conductivity ; however , these only yield contributions to @xmath26 and will be discussed in section  [ sec : sxy ] . the fermion polarization contribution to @xmath25",

    "will show how this delta function is broadened out by inelastic , incoherent collisions that appear at higher orders in @xmath33 . the second piece , @xmath129 is a smooth continuum contribution from the creation of quasi - particle / quasi - hole pairs by the external source , to the real part of the conductivity , and contains the coherent contribution in the limit @xmath130 ; after a change of variables in the momentum integration from @xmath131 to @xmath132 , it can be written as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "the real part of this result can be evaluated in closed form @xmath135 =   \\frac{\\pi q^2 e^2 } { 8h } \\theta ( |\\omega| - 2 m(t ) )   \\left ( 1 + \\frac{4 m^2 ( t)}{\\omega^2 } \\right ) \\tanh(|\\omega|/4t),\\ ] ] while the imaginary part can be obtained by a kramers - kronig transform of @xmath136 - \\pi q^2 e^2/8 h$ ] .",
    "note that , after using ( [ self5 ] ) for @xmath99 , the result ( [ ecoh ] ) is consistent with the scaling form ( [ scale ] ) . we show a plot of the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath137 in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "there are weak threshold singularities at @xmath138 : a discontinuity in @xmath139 $ ] and a corresponding logarithmic divergence in @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "these are artifacts of the absence of damping in the fermion propagators at this order , and the singularities are expected to be smoothed out at higher orders .",
    "the previous computation of @xmath141 $ ] in ref   was carried out at @xmath4 , in which we obtain only the @xmath130 limit of @xmath142 which , from ( [ ecoh ] ) , is given by @xmath143 in the limit @xmath144 relevant to d.c . transport , @xmath25 is dominated by @xmath145 , which at this order is a delta function at zero frequency : as stated earlier , this will be repaired in section  [ qtrans ] by a quantum transport analysis .      unlike @xmath25 , the zeroth order in @xmath33 result for @xmath26 vanishes identically at the critical point .",
    "it is necessary to go to first order in @xmath33 , where one finds two distinct types of contributions .",
    "the first ( denoted @xmath146 ) comes from the simple fermion polarization bubble considered above for @xmath25 , but with the first order result for the mass @xmath99 in ( [ self5 ] ) included .",
    "the second comes from the diagrams , considered in ref .  , which are explicitly first order in @xmath33 : these account for the momentum dependence of the self - energy ( denoted @xmath147 ) and the corresponding vertex correction ( denoted @xmath148 ) .",
    "considering first the contribution of the simple polarization bubble .",
    "this gives @xmath149 evaluating the dirac trace and the frequency summation , we find that the leading @xmath150 explicitly cancels out : as a result there will be no singular @xmath151 contributions to @xmath26 as there were to @xmath25 .",
    "we change variables in the momentum integration from @xmath131 to @xmath132 , and analytically continue to real frequencies , and the answer takes the final form @xmath152 notice that there is @xmath99 in the prefactor , and so this result is at least first order in @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , it is not permissible to simply set @xmath115 in the lower limit of the integration to obtain the leading result : this is because the integrand has a potential logarithmic divergence for @xmath153 , which is cutoff by the lower limit . the result ( [ sxy1 ] ) vanishes as @xmath154 in the limit @xmath130 , while in the d.c .",
    "limit @xmath155 we get after using ( [ self5 ] ) and manipulations described in appendix  [ zeta ] : @xmath156 \\label{sxy1n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath157 is euler s constant and @xmath158 is the reimann zeta function .",
    "notice the non - analytic @xmath159 term : the proper @xmath8 dependence of the mass @xmath99 discussed in section  [ sec : self ] was required to obtain this .",
    "we now combine ( [ sxy1 ] ) , ( [ sxy2 ] ) and ( [ sxy3 ] ) to obtain the final results for @xmath26 .",

    "notice that there are no delta function contributions to @xmath26 : this implies that the entire contribution is due to coherent quasi - particle / quasi - hole creation , and the collisionless flow of pre - existing thermally excited particles / holes contributes only to @xmath173    we conclude this section be showing a plot of the frequency dependence of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath26 in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "notice that , as in @xmath25 there are threshold singularities at @xmath138 : a discontinuity in @xmath140 $ ] and a corresponding logarithmic divergence in @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "again these artifacts of the absence of damping in the fermion propagators at this order .",
    "the perturbative analysis of @xmath24 in section  [ kubo ] produced results which had singularities at two frequencies : a delta function in @xmath173 at @xmath174 , and much weaker logarithmic singularities at @xmath175 .",
    "both these features are in fact artifacts of the low order results , and disappear when damping of fermion excitations is accounted for at higher orders . in this section , we shall show how the delta function singularity at @xmath176 is broadened out at order @xmath177 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath175 is due to a threshold to creation of particle - hole pairs : it is also expected to be smoothed out at order @xmath177 , but determination of the precise form of this is left as an open problem .",
    "so to reiterate , this section will only describe the changes to the result for @xmath173 in ( [ eqp ] ) at higher order in @xmath33 .",
    "the perturbative results for the other pieces of @xmath24 , in particular , ( [ ecoh ] ) for @xmath25 and ( [ sxy1 ] ) , ( [ sxy2 ] ) , and ( [ sxy3 ] ) for @xmath26 , will be used unchanged in our subsequent considerations as their spurious singularities are relatively minor .    the delta function singularity in @xmath173 ,",
    "will be explicitly shown below to be due to the collisionless transport of thermally excited quasiparticles and quasiholes .",
    "this will be done as in i : by writing down transport equations for the distribution functions of these excitations .",
    "the collisionless form of these equations appear in section  [ cless ] and their solution reproduces the result for @xmath173 obtained in section  [ sec : sxx ] ; then , in section  [ cdom ] , we include collision terms and present the numerical solution .",
    "we begin by recalling the defining relation ( [ cs9 ] ) for @xmath24 : it is the linear response in the current to the total internal field @xmath68 .",
    "fortunately , the field @xmath68 appears in the transport equation in a simple and natural way : the effect of the hartree and fock terms is precisely such as to modify the external field @xmath65 to @xmath68  @xcite . as a result",
    "we can simply omit these terms while replacing @xmath65 by @xmath68 , and determination of the @xmath24 becomes , as in i , a matter of balancing the ballistic , particle streaming terms with the collision term .    throughout section  [ qtrans ]",
    "we will work with fermionic excitations with a spectrum @xmath178 _ i.e. _ we will set the mass @xmath160 ; as the hartree and fock terms in the self - energy are also implicitly accounted for in our analysis , this is equivalent to simply disregarding such terms and working with a @xmath179 with @xmath180 . in this approximation",
    "the transport analysis will yield a normalization constant for the spectral weight in the conductivity in ( [ eqp ] ) which is given by the result correct to leading order in @xmath33 , @xmath181 .",
    "our objective will then be to describe the broadening of the delta function in ( [ eqp ] ) , while omiting all terms which lead to corrections in its total spectral weight .",
    "the simplest formulation of the transport equations is in a basis which diagonalizes the hamiltonian @xmath96 .",
    "to do this , we first express @xmath88 in its fourier components @xmath182 and then perform a unitary transformation from the fourier mode operators @xmath183 to @xmath184 : @xmath185 we have introduced here a notational convention that we shall find quite useful in the following : as @xmath186 is a two - dimensional momentum , we can define the complex number @xmath187 by @xmath188 and @xmath189 . expressing the hamiltonian @xmath96 in terms of @xmath190",
    ", we obtain the simple result @xmath191 where the sum over @xmath192 extends over @xmath193 .",
    "so @xmath194 creates a particle with energy @xmath131 , while @xmath195 creates a particle with energy @xmath196 . at zero temperature",
    "the negative energy states will be filled : so we identify @xmath194 as the creation operator for quasiparticles , while @xmath197 is the creation operator for quasiholes .",
    "notice that the quasiparticles and quasiholes are distinct excitations in different bands , and the absence of a quasiparticle is _ not _ equivalent to the presence of a quasihole : this latter feature was also present in the bosonic analysis of i , and as argued there , allows the system to acquire a non - zero d.c .",

    "an analytic solution is clearly out of the question and , we obtained the solution numerically .",
    "however , before attempting any numerical solution , the singular nature of the scattering cross - sections @xmath223 and @xmath224 makes it essential to obtain an analytic understanding of the nature of any potential infrared divergences arising from the momentum integration",
    ". we will show below that all the potentially infrared divergent terms in the collision integral do indeed vanish .",
    "however just this knowledge is not sufficient to allow one to proceed with the numerical integration .",
    "one does not want numerically integrate an integrand with potentially divergent terms which will eventually average out to a finite answer , as such a procedure is clearly prone to large systematic numerical errors ; rather one wants an integrand which is explicitly free of singularities . on the other hand , the integrand is dependent upon the unknown function @xmath216 , so explicitly removing the singularities is difficult .",
    "these issues are clearly crucial , but also vexing , and stymied the author for some time .",
    "eventually , a remarkably simple and useful parametrization of the collision term was found .",
    "as the analytic discussion of the cancellation of singularities is also simplest in this new parametrization , we will first introduce it , and then discuss the cancellation .",
    "the key is to carry out the @xmath226 integration in the collision term of ( [ trans2 ] ) first , and to notice that the delta function associated with energy conservation @xmath227 defines an ellipse in the @xmath226 plane with foci at @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",

    "this is summarized by the general formula @xmath235 where @xmath236 is an arbitrary function , and in the last equation we use the value of @xmath231 given in ( [ muval ] ) and @xmath237 given in ( [ qval ] ) .",
    "we are now prepared to discuss the handling of the infrared divergences in ( [ trans2 ] ) .",
    "there are two distinct types of potential divergences and we will consider them in turn .    *",
    "the first singularity is associated with the divergence in the forward scattering cross - section . by an examination of ( [ deft12 ] )",
    "we see that there is a @xmath238 divergence in @xmath223 when the momentum transfer @xmath226 approaches zero , and also a @xmath239 divergence in @xmath224 when the momentum transfer @xmath226 approaches @xmath240 ; the latter divergence corresponds to forward scattering with an exchange of particles .",
    "( note that there is no divergence when the momentum transfer @xmath241 vanishes , as is easily seen by an examination of the @xmath192 labels in ( [ deft12 ] ) , combined with the expression ( [ deft ] ) ) .",
    "however , we then notice from the right hand side of ( [ trans2 ] ) that the coefficient of @xmath223 in the collision term vanishes at @xmath242 ; the term in the co - efficient linear in @xmath226 will vanish after an appropriate angular integral over @xmath226 , and the remaining combination is explicitly finite at @xmath243 .",
    "similar considerations apply to the the coefficient of @xmath224 , which vanishes at @xmath244 .",
    "the physics of this cancellation is simple and quite familiar .",
    "its origin is the `` @xmath245 '' phase space factor that appears in the expression for transport relaxation rates  @xcite : this vanishes at zero scattering angle , and cancels out the divergence in the scattering cross - section .",
    "+ now there remains the issue of how to numerically treat this potential divergence .",
    "it is clear that the angular integral around @xmath242 and @xmath246 should be taken with great care , or we will be left with a spurious divergence . here",
    "our elliptical parametrization ( [ qval ] ) turns out to be helpful .",
    "notice that , as must be the case , the points @xmath243 and @xmath246 satisfy the delta function in ( [ defellipse ] ) , and therefore lie on the ellipse defined by ( [ muval ] ) .",
    "these points lie at @xmath247 and @xmath248 where @xmath249 is determined by the equation @xmath250 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath251 , and therefore has two solutions which are easily determined . for @xmath231 give by ( [ muval ] ) ,",
    "one of the solution will have unit modulus and therefore determines a real @xmath249 : this is guaranteed by the fact that @xmath242 lies on the ellipse defined by ( [ muval ] ) .",
    "the angular averaging is carried out by the @xmath232 integral in ( [ thetaint ] ) , and we now simply have to insure that the vicinities of the points @xmath247 ( and @xmath248 ) are treated symmetrically .",
    "more precisely , we always pair the integrands at @xmath252 and @xmath253 ( and also at @xmath254 and @xmath255 ) so that the combined integrand is explicitly finite at the potentially singular points .",
    "* the second potential singularity arises purely from phase space considerations , and is a curious property of energy - conserving scattering of particles in two dimensions with the linear dispersion @xmath178 .",
    "we are considering the scattering of two incoming particles with momenta @xmath186 and @xmath229 .",
    "consider the case where these two momenta are collinear and point in the same direction _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath256 .",
    "we are eventually integrating over @xmath229 in the collision term of ( [ trans2 ] ) , and this condition defines a semi - infinite line in the two - dimensional @xmath229 space . along this line , we see from ( [ muval ] ) that @xmath257 . now",
    "the phase space factor @xmath258 in ( [ thetaint ] ) looks dangerous ( generically the @xmath226 integral in ( [ thetaint ] ) will be non - singular , and will not effect the considerations here ) . this infinite factor is present along the entire semi - infinite line in the @xmath229 plane : if we pick a point a distance @xmath259 from this line ( almost collinear particles ) we find that the @xmath258 factor diverges as @xmath260 .",
    "this implies a logarithmic divergence in the @xmath229 integral .",
    "fortunately , the specific form of @xmath261 , @xmath262 under consideration here comes to the rescue .",
    "it is easy to show from ( [ deft],[deft12 ] ) that these cross - sections vanish identically for the case of the scattering of particles moving in the same direction .",
    "the remaining steps in the solution of the integral equation were relatively straightforward .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath263 for large @xmath131 , and so it is an excellent approximation to simply truncate the infinite range of @xmath131 integration at some large positive @xmath131 . over this finite range , we expanded @xmath264 over the space of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "we determined the action of the kernel of the integral equation on each chebyshev polynomials , and decomposed the resultant also over chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this defined a discrete matrix , which is the transcription of the kernel to the discrete basis space of chebyshev polynomials . solving the integral equation",
    "then simply became a matter of inverting the matrix .",
    "notice that as the kernel does not explicitly depend upon frequency , the same matrix could be used at any frequency .",
    "we now present the results of the above numerical analysis .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis of ( [ trans2 ] ) shows that the entire @xmath8 and @xmath33 dependence of the integral equation can be scaled out , and the resulting scaled equation is parameter free .",

    "we will now finally turn to a discussion of the properties of the physical conductivity @xmath23 .",
    "the several disparate ingredients necessary for its computation have all been assembled , and let us now summarize them .",
    "we began with a model with two species of anyons @xmath42 .",
    "we defined their irreducible conductivities @xmath274 and argued that the physical conductivity @xmath23 was related to them by ( [ cs11 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath81 anyons were non - critical and the value of @xmath275 is given simply by ( [ cs12 ] ) .",
    "sections  [ kubo ] and  [ qtrans ] were devoted to studying the value of the critical @xmath276 .",
    "section  [ kubo ] considered the perturbative contribution which in the limit @xmath130 reduced to the coherent transport of externally created particle - hole pairs .",
    "the hall conductivity was given entirely by such a contribution : @xmath277 where the results are given in ( [ sxy1 ] ) , ( [ sxy2 ] ) and ( [ sxy3 ] ) respectively .",
    "the longitudinal conductivity consists of the coherent contribution @xmath137 given in ( [ ecoh ] ) , and an incoherent quasiparticle contribution @xmath173 which was computed in section  [ qtrans ] ; the latter satisfies the scaling form ( [ scalesqp ] ) and the scaling function @xmath271 was plotted in fig  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the above discussion can be restated as follows .",
    "let us define the dimensionless functions @xmath278 , @xmath279 by @xmath280 then , the physical conductivities are given by @xmath281 we emphasize that @xmath278 and @xmath279 are complex , universal functions of @xmath282 , and it is necessary to include both their real and imaginary parts in the above expressions .    in evaluating our final results for @xmath14 ,",
    "an important complicating factor becomes apparent .",
    "while we are ultimately interested in @xmath33 of order unity , the terms entering ( [ syn2 ] ) are of many differing orders in @xmath33 for small @xmath33 . as a result ,",
    "certain processes become unphysically dominant at small @xmath33 , while in the real system we expect a more even - handed competition .",
    "further the terms also vary on differing scales of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the quasiparticle / quasihole conductivity @xmath173 is of overall order @xmath283 and varies on a frequency scale @xmath284 ; for small @xmath2 it is the most dominant term as @xmath285 . of the other terms",
    ", @xmath137 is order unity , while @xmath286 are of order @xmath33 , and all vary on a scale @xmath287 ; these become important for large @xmath2 as @xmath285 .",
    "because of these complications , we believe more significance should be attached to the form of our results for the individual conductivities in section  [ kubo ] and  [ qtrans ] . the final results , when these distinct components are combined , are expected to be less reliable for moderate @xmath33 .",
    "we begin by describing the formal structure of the small @xmath33 expansion for @xmath23 .",
    "it is necessary to consider two distinct frequency regimes separately : ( a ) : in this @xmath288 is the dominant term , and examination of the small @xmath33 limit of ( [ syn2 ] ) gives @xmath289   \\label{syn3}\\ ] ] we show a plot of the result above for @xmath290 $ ] in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "notice that this not simply the inverse of the real plot in fig  [ fig4 ] , as the first equation in ( [ syn3 ] ) involves the inverse of the _ complex _ function @xmath271 .",
    "the function @xmath291 $ ] approaches a finite number in both the limits @xmath292 ( where it is simply the inverse of ( [ lim1 ] ) and @xmath293 : @xmath294 & = &   2.29 \\nonumber \\\\ { \\rm re } \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\widetilde{\\sigma}_{xx}^{{\\rm qp } } ( \\widetilde{\\omega } \\rightarrow \\infty ) } \\right ] & = & 3.47 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a similar manner , we can also get the hall conductivity in this regime : @xmath295 \\label{syn4}\\ ] ] surprisingly , this result for @xmath15 has the opposite sign from the hall conductivity of the quantized hall phase connected to the critical point under consideration here : we strongly suspect this feature is an artifact of the absence scattering from interactions other than the chern simons term : a model in which @xmath173 is not so singular in the small @xmath33 limit should have a hall conductivity of the `` correct '' sign .",
    "( b ) : now the result is constructed simply by inserting the perturbative results of section  [ kubo ] for @xmath24 in ( [ syn2 ] ) .",
    "the formal small @xmath33 expansion is @xmath296\\alpha + \\ldots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the ingredients determining the coefficients were plotted in figs  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "an alternative approach to gaining some understanding of the predictions of ( [ syn2 ] ) is to simply evaluate the full expression at a given value of @xmath33 .",
    "this has been done in figs  [ fig6 ] and  [ fig7 ] , which show the results of directly evaluating ( [ syn2 ] ) at face value at @xmath297 .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to describe the dynamic transport properties of the the simplest possible quantum critical point in a quantum hall system .",
    "in particular , motivated by experimental results discussed in section  [ intro ] , we chose a model quantum phase transition which had non - zero interactions in the critical fixed point theory .",
    "the critical properties of such theories have a _",
    "universal _ dependence of all observables on @xmath86 , and , as pointed in i , the dependence of the conductivity on @xmath86 at two dimensional quantum critical points is especially important .",
    "the model we chose , @xmath52 in ( [ cs1 ] ) , is equivalent to a model of free anyons and anti - anyons with a relativistic dirac spectrum .",
    "this model is properly considered as an interacting theory for the following reason : two anyonic / anti - anyonic excitatios have a non - trivial @xmath8 matrix for scattering  @xcite in which the momenta of the ingoing and outgoing particles can be arbitrary , and are subject only to the constraints of conservation of total energy and momentum ( it is clear that this fails only for purely bosonic or fermionic statistics , when the ingoing and outgoing momenta are the same ) .",
    "such scattering is the main ingredient in establishing local equilibrium , and is essential to the description of transport in the regime @xmath298 .",
    "our results for the non - zero temperature transport properties were summarized in section  [ synth ] .",
    "it is evident from the discussion there that , while the general scaling forms for the conductivities are very similar to those discussed in i for the boson superfluid - insulator transition , the explicit results for the scaling functions themselves are quite different .",
    "for instance , we found in i that the longitudinal conductivity @xmath299 was a decreasing function of increasing @xmath2 near @xmath174 . in the present quantum hall problem , we found that for small @xmath33 , the longitudinal conductivity satisfied ( [ syn3 ] ) , and is therefore seen to be an increasing function of @xmath2 near @xmath176 , as shown in fig  [ fig5 ] .",
    "this property was subsequently responsible for a peak in @xmath14 near @xmath287 shown in fig  [ fig6 ] .",
    "as they stand , our model calculations can probably not be directly applied to microwave conductivity measurements in the quantum hall system  @xcite . the most important defect that must be repaired",
    "is the absence of coulomb interactions among the charged excitations .",
    "a simple power counting argument shows that the coulomb interaction is a marginal perturbation at the fixed point considered here .",
    "a theory for the consequences of this marginal perturbation is not available at present , and appears to us to be an important subject for future research .",
    "it is interesting to note that since the coulomb interaction is marginal at tree level , it must be characterized by a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "it is easy to see that this coupling constant is @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the velocity of the dirac fermions , @xmath34 is the velocity of light , and the quantity in the parenthesis is the dimensionless fine structure constant . for @xmath301 , it seems reasonable to use a typical drift velocity of electrons in the two - dimensional electron gas @xmath302 , and we see then that this dimensionless coupling can be quite large .",
    "the dirac fermion model ( at @xmath303 ) also describes quasiparticles in a d - wave superconductor , and so the dimensionless coupling characterizing the coulomb interactions can also be quite large for the high temperature superconductors .",

    "the bare `` mass '' term , @xmath313 , is cutoff dependent , and must be adjusted order by order in @xmath312 so that the system is at its quantum critical point at @xmath4 .",
    "the superfluid - insulator transition of boson hubbard models is described by the case @xmath314 , where @xmath315 is the usual complex superfluid order parameter .",
    "the case @xmath316 which applies to quantum - critical points in quantum antiferromagnets  @xcite",
    ".    first we review the large @xmath13 expansion for the order parameter susceptibility , which is the propagator , @xmath266 , of the @xmath308 field .",
    "this was extensively discussed in ref  @xcite . at momentum @xmath186 , and matsubara frequency",
    "@xmath317 , the @xmath318 result for this propagator is @xmath319 where @xmath320 is a pure ( universal ) number : @xmath321 the @xmath13 corrections are obtained by decoupling the quartic term in ( [ actionr ] ) by a hubbard - stratanovish field @xmath322 ( not to be confused with the charge subscript @xmath192 used in section  [ qtrans ] , and also below ) .",
    "there is then a three - point coupling @xmath323 in the action .",
    "the propagator of the @xmath322 field is given by the inverse of the bubble graph of the @xmath324 field .",
    "in the low - energy , long - distance limit relevant for the critical properties , this propagator becomes independent of the microscopic value of @xmath312 , and equals @xmath325 where @xmath326 notice that there is a factor of @xmath13 associated with each @xmath322 propagator : this comes from the sum over the @xmath304 components of the @xmath324 field in the bubble graph .",
    "so the @xmath13 expansion for the susceptibility is generated by expanding in the number of @xmath322 propagators .",
    "now we turn to transport properties .",
    "the value of the conductivity at @xmath318 was discussed in section ii of i. the structure was very similar to that obtained in an expansion in @xmath327 : there was a quasiparticle / quasihole delta function at @xmath176 , and a continuum contribution at frequencies greater than @xmath328 .",
    "the main purpose of this appendix is to determine the manner in which the @xmath176 delta function broadens out in the @xmath13 expansion .",
    "naturally , this will be done by formulating the transport equations of the quasiparticles and quasiholes in the large @xmath304 limit .",
    "the general @xmath304 transport equations for @xmath329 were discussed in appendix b of i in an expansion in @xmath312 .",
    "following that treatment , we consider here the linear response to an `` electric '' field , @xmath65 , which couples only to the @xmath330 components _ i.e. _ the corresponding electric potential couples to a generator of @xmath306 which rotates the system in the @xmath331 plane .",
    "then it was argued that the distribution function of excitations in the remaining components remained unchanged to linear order in the field  all corrections are at least quadratic in @xmath65 . in other words , if , as in i , we make the mode expansion in terms of particle creation and annihilation operators @xmath332 with the dispersion @xmath333 then , we have @xmath334 this has very important consequences for the large @xmath304 expansion .",
    "recall that the inverse propagator of the @xmath322 field was given by the sum over the bubble graphs of the @xmath304 components of the @xmath324 . in the large @xmath304 limit , this sum is dominated by the @xmath335 components , and so also remains unaffected to linear order in @xmath65 .",
    "so we can assume that the propagator for @xmath322 is still given by ( [ app1 ] ) .",
    "the above large @xmath304 analysis can obviously be carried out at any @xmath344 .",
    "it is useful to do this and then take the limit of small @xmath345 .",
    "we find that the equation so obtained agrees _ precisely _ with the large @xmath304 limit of the small @xmath345 equation discussed in appendix b of i for general @xmath304 .",
    "thus the @xmath346 and @xmath347 limits of the quantum transport equations commute , and this is an important check of the consistency of our analysis .    our results can be easily extended to the large @xmath304 limit of either bosonic  @xcite or fermionic  @xcite theories with chern - simons terms .",
    "for instance , an alternative formulation of the theory of anyons considered in this paper is to represent them as relativistic bosons with attached statistical flux tubes : this is represented by a generalization of the action @xmath329 as follows  @xcite . consider the case with @xmath348 even , parametrize the @xmath349 real fields @xmath324 in terms of @xmath350 complex fields @xmath351 @xmath352 now couple a @xmath12 chern simons field to the diagonal @xmath12 charge @xmath353 notice that the effective statistcs parameter of the anyons is @xmath354 : this is necessarily very close of the bosonic limit for large @xmath350 .",
    "the large @xmath350 analysis of @xmath355 is very similar to that of @xmath52 : in addition to the field @xmath322 , we now have a gauge field @xmath40 whose propagator is also given by a boson current polarization bubble , and is of order @xmath356  @xcite . by arguments very similar to those for @xmath322 , we can conclude that the deviations in the @xmath40 propagator due to the external electric field can be neglected _",
    "i.e. _ `` photon drag '' is negligible in the large @xmath350 limit .",
    "the resulting quantum transport equation is then very similar ( [ app2 ] ) : along with the terms already displayed , we have an additional parallel set with @xmath357 replaced by the spectral density of the @xmath40 propagator times current matrix elements of the @xmath351 field .",
