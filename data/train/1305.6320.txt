    "human response time ( rt ) is defined as the time delay between a signal and the starting point of human action .",
    "for example , one can measure time interval from a word appearing on a computer screen to when a participant pushes a keyboard button to indicate his or her response .",
    "two well established empirical facts of rt are the power law tails of rt distributions @xcite and 1/f noise of rt time series @xcite , to which any theoretical description must conform .",
    "the generalized inverse gamma ( giga ) function ( appendix [ giga_scale ] ) belongs to a family of distributions ( appendix [ giga_ln ] ) , which includes inverse gamma ( iga ) , lognormal ( ln ) , gamma ( ga ) and generalized gamma ( gga ) .",
    "the remarkable property of giga is its power - law tail ; for a general three - parameter case , the power - law exponent is given by the negative @xmath0 , so that @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "giga emerges as a steady state distribution in a number of systems , from a network model of economy , @xcite to ontogenetic mass growth , @xcite to stock volatility @xcite .",
    "this common feature can be traced to a birth - death phenomenological model subject to stochastic perturbations ( appendix [ birth_death ] ) .",
    "here we argue that among closed form distributions the giga best describes rt distribution .",
    "giga has a natural scale parameter , which determines the onset of the power law tail , and two shape parameters , which determine the exponent of the tail .",
    "as such , our argument is an extension of previous approaches , such as  cocktail \" model , @xcite which effectively contains shape and scale parameters as well .",
    "furthermore , we speculate that the difficulty of a cognitive task tracks the half - width of the rt distribution and discuss it within the giga framework .    our numerical analysis is performed on the following data ( explained in text ) : elp ( english lexicon project ) , he ( hick s experiments ) and ldt ( lexical decision time ) .",
    "two key features distinguish our approach .",
    "first , in addition to usual individual participant fitting , we perform distribution fitting on combined participants data . while in line with individual fitting",
    ", this creates considerably less noisy sets of data .",
    "second , we develop a procedure for fitting the tails of the distribution directly ( appendix [ tail_power ] ) , which unequivocally proves the existence of power law tails .",

    "ii , we provide description of the experimental setup and data acquisition . in section iii , we conduct log - log tail fitting and rt distribution fitting with giga . in section iv , we conclude with the discussion of task difficulty .",
