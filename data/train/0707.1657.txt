    "most of these applications require bottom and top electrodes to exploit the electronic properties of the functional materials .",
    "srruo@xmath1  ( sro ) has been found to be very useful for electrodes and junctions in microelectronic devices because of its good electrical and thermal conductivity , better surface stability , and high resistance to chemical corrosion , which could minimize interface electrochemical reactions , charge injection in oxide , and other detrimental processes @xcite thus improving retention , fatigue resistance , and imprint .",

    "growth of an atomically flat epitaxial sro film is required for a smooth and stable interface which is essential for the growth of subsequent layers , as high imperfections and roughness in the base layer can induce defects in the upper layers , which can irreversibly destroy the material properties .",

    "the in - plane lattice strain between sto@xmath11 and sro@xmath12 and sto@xmath12 and sro@xmath13 was calculated and found to be 0.5% compressive and this should result out - of - the - plane lattice parameter of 3.939    in [ 110 ] and 5.557    in [ 010 ] orientated films , which agrees with our observed values as strain gradually relaxes with increasing thickness .",
