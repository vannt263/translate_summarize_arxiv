    "a recent study , based on the correlation of faraday rotation measures and mgii absorption lines ( which trace halos of galaxies ) , indicates that coherent @xmath3g - strength magnetic fields were already in place in normal galaxies ( like the milky way ) when the universe was less than half its present age  @xcite .",
    "this places strong constraints both on the strength of the initial magnetic seed field and the time - scale required for amplification .",
    "understanding the origin and evolution of these fields is one of the challenging questions of modern astrophysics .",
    "there are two generation scenarios under discussion currently : a bottom - up ( astrophysical ) one , where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales ; and , a top - down ( cosmological ) scenario , where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early universe on scales that are large now .",
    "more precisely , astrophysical seed field sources include battery mechanisms , plasma processes , or simple transport of magnetic flux from compact systems ( e.g.  stars , agns ) , where magnetic field generation can be extremely fast because of the rapid rotation @xcite",
    ". obviously , the correlation length of such a seed field can not be larger than a characteristic galactic length scale , and is typically much smaller . in the cosmological seed field scenario , @xcite",
    ", the seed field correlation length could be significantly larger than the current hubble radius , if it was generated by quantum fluctuations during inflation .",
    "there are different options for seed field amplification , ranging from the mhd dynamo to the adiabatic compression of the magnetic field lines during structure formation @xcite .",
    "the presence of turbulence in cosmic plasma plays a crucial role in both of these processes .",
    "the mhd turbulence was investigated a long time ago when considering the processes in astrophysical plasma , while there is a lack of studies when addressing the turbulence effects in cosmological contexts @xcite . in the late stages of evolution",
    "the energy density present in the form of turbulent motions in clusters can be as large as 5 - 10% of the thermal energy density @xcite .",

    "we consider the presence of a primordial magnetic field in the universe and give a simplified description of its effect on large scale structure formation .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field has been generated during the radiation dominated epoch and prior to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "since the magnetic energy density contributes to the relativistic component , the presence of such a magnetic field affects the moment of matter - radiation equality , shifting it to a later stages .",
    "we focus on the linear matter power spectrum in order to show that even if the total energy density present in the magnetic field ( and as a consequence in magnetized turbulence ) is small enough , its effects might be substantial , and the effect becomes stronger due to non - linearity of processes under consideration .",
    "it has become conventional to derive the cosmological effects of a seed magnetic field by using its spectral shape ( parameterized by the spectral index @xmath6 ) and the smoothed value of the magnetic field ( @xmath7 ) at a given scale @xmath8 ( which is usually taken to be 1 mpc ) .",
    "in @xcite we developed a different and more adequate formalism based on the effective magnetic field value that is determined by the total energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "such an approach has been mostly motivated by the simplest energy constraint on the magnetic field generated in the early universe . in order to preserve bbn physics , only 10% of the relativistic energy density",
    "can be added to the radiation energy density , leading to the limit on the total magnetic field energy density corresponding to the effective magnetic field value order of @xmath2 g. more precise studies of the influence of the primordial magnetic field on the expansion rate and the abundance of light elements performed recently @xcite , lead to effective magnetic field amplitudes with order of @xmath9 g.    the described formalism has been applied to describe two different effects of the primordial magnetic field ; the cmb faraday rotation effect and mass dispersion @xcite . as a striking consequence ,",
    "we show that even an extremely small smoothed magnetic field of @xmath10 g at 1 mpc , with the batchelor spectral shape ( @xmath11 ) at large scales , can leave detectable signatures in cmb or lss statistics . in the present investigation we focus on the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effect , the cluster number density , and lyman-@xmath0 data .",

    "<S> we study primordial magnetic field effects on the matter perturbations in the universe . we assume magnetic field generation prior to the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , i.e. during the radiation dominated epoch of the universe expansion , but do not limit analysis by considering a particular magnetogenesis scenario . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to previous studies , we limit the total magnetic field energy density and not the smoothed amplitude of the magnetic field at large ( order of 1 mpc ) scales . </S>",
    "<S> we review several cosmological signatures , such as halos abundance , thermal sunyaev zeldovich ( tsz ) effect , and lyman-@xmath0 data . for a cross check </S>",
    "<S> we compare our limits with that obtained through the cmb faraday rotation effect and bbn . </S>",
    "<S> the limits are ranging between 1.5 ng and 4.5 ng for @xmath1 . </S>"
