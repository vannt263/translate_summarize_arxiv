    "the nuclear @xmath4 decay , which is mediated by strangeness conserving charged weak current is expected to occur through double - electron emission @xmath5 , double - positron emission @xmath6 , electron - positron conversion @xmath7 and double - electron capture @xmath8 with the emission of two neutrinos , no neutrinos , single majoron and double majorons .",
    "the @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath10@xmath12 processes are energetically competing and we refer to them as @xmath13 decay .",
    "the @xmath14 decay conserves the lepton number exactly and is an allowed process in standard model of electroweak interactions ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the lepton number violating @xmath16 decay , which is theoretically possible in many a gauge models beyond the @xmath15 , has not been observed so far .",
    "all the present experimental efforts are devoted to its observation , which would immediately imply that neutrinos are massive majorana particles . in comparison to the @xmath17 decay , less attention has been paid to study the @xmath13 decay due to relatively low q - values and low abundances of @xmath13 emitters .",
    "the experimental and theoretical developments in the study of nuclear @xmath18 decay have been excellently reviewed over the past years @xcite .",
    "the half - life @xmath19 of @xmath20 decay is a product of accurately known phase space factor @xmath21 and nuclear transition matrix element ( ntme ) @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the validity of different models employed for nuclear structure calculations can be tested by comparing the calculated ntmes @xmath3 with those extracted from the experimentally observed half - lives @xmath19 for the @xmath22 transition of @xmath23 mode .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath23 mode , which has been observed in ten @xmath24 emitters out of 35 potential candidates , the @xmath25 decay modes have not been observed experimentally so far .",
    "however , limits on their half - lives @xmath19 have been given for 24 out of 34 possible isotopes @xcite .",
    "et al _ have reported on a positive observation of @xmath26ba decay with half - life @xmath27 y for all modes @xcite and this result is consistent with theoretical expectations for the @xmath28 mode @xcite .",
    "this value is in slight contradiction with the experimental limit @xmath29 y reported in @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , it would be the very first observation of @xmath13 decay . in the absence of experimental data",
    ", there is no way to judge the reliability of present nuclear structure calculations . in principle",
    ", the @xmath17 decay and @xmath13 decay can provide the same information .",
    "the observation of @xmath30 decay will be interesting from the nuclear structure point of view , as it will be a challenging task to calculate the ntmes of these modes along with the @xmath31 mode in the same theoretical framework and it will further constrain the nuclear models employed to study the @xmath4 decay . in addition , the observation of @xmath32 decay will be helpful in deciding finer issues like dominance of mass mechanism or admixture of the right handed current in the electroweak interaction @xcite .",
    "rosen and primakoff were the first to study the @xmath25 decay theoretically @xcite .",
    "later on , kim and kubodera estimated the half - lives of all the three modes with estimated ntme and non - relativistic phase space factors @xcite . abad",
    "_ et al _ performed similar calculations using relativistic coulomb wave functions @xcite .",
    "in addition , some other theoretical studies were done by zeldovich _",
    "et al _ @xcite , eramzhyan _ et al _ @xcite , bernabeu _ et al _ @xcite and balaev _ et al _ @xcite . the @xmath33 decay has been studied mainly in three types of models , namely shell model and its variants , the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its extensions and alternative models @xcite .",
    "the nuclear many - body problem is solved as exactly as possible in the shell - model and it is the best choice for the calculation of the ntmes .",
    "however , the number of basis states increases quite drastically for most of the @xmath4 decay emitters as they are medium or heavy mass nuclei and hence , vergados has studied the @xmath33 decay of @xmath34ni , @xmath35mo and @xmath36ru nuclei in the weak coupling limit . over the past years , the large scale shell - model calculations have been successfully performed to study the potential @xmath4 emitters @xcite . in the shell - model ,",
    "the @xmath30 decay modes of @xmath37ca @xcite , @xmath38ar , @xmath39fe , @xmath34ni @xcite and @xmath40mo @xcite isotopes have been investigated .",
    "the qrpa has emerged as the most successful model in explaining the observed quenching of ntmes by incorporating the particle - particle part of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction in the proton - neutron channel @xcite and the observed half - lives @xmath19 of several @xmath41 decay emitters were reproduced successfully @xcite . in the qrpa model ,",
    "staudt _ et al _ have evaluated the ntmes for @xmath42 mode @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 decay modes were studied in the qrpa and its extensions @xcite . in spite of the success of the qrpa in the study of @xmath4 decay ,",
    "there is a need to include the deformation degrees of freedom in its formalism .",
    "the deformed qrpa model has been developed for studying @xmath4 decay of spherical as well as deformed nuclei .",

    "model , the two crucial components of effective two body interaction , namely pairing and quadrupolar correlations are incorporated on equal footing and the rotational symmetry is restored by projection technique providing wave functions with good angular momentum for the parent and daughter nuclei involved in the @xmath4 decay .",
    "however , the phfb model is unable to provide information about the structure of intermediate odd @xmath45-odd @xmath46 nuclei in its present version and hence , on the single-@xmath0 decay rates and the distribution of gt strength . in spite of this limitation , the phfb model , in conjunction with pairing plus",
    "quadrupole - quadrupole ( @xmath50 ) interaction @xcite , has been successfully applied to study the @xmath22 transition of @xmath51 modes @xcite , where it was possible to describe the lowest excited states of the parent and daughter nuclei along with their electromagnetic transition strengths , as well as to reproduce their measured @xmath17 decay rates @xcite .    in the phfb model ,",
    "the existence of an inverse correlation between the quadrupole deformations and the magnitudes of ntmes @xmath3 has been shown @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been observed that the ntmes are usually large in the absence of quadrupolar correlations . with the inclusion of the quadrupolar correlations ,",
    "the ntmes are almost constant for small admixture of the @xmath52 interaction and suppressed substantially in realistic situation . for similar deformations of parent and daughter nuclei ,",
    "the ntmes have well defined maximum @xcite . in the interacting shell model ( ism )",

    "the deformation parameters @xmath53 for parent @xmath1dy and daughter",
    "@xmath1gd nuclei are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , which will provide a typical case study of the deformation effect .",
    "the present paper is organised as follows .",
    "we briefly present in section 2 the required theoretical formalism . in section 3 ,",
    "we calculate half - lives @xmath56 for the @xmath22 transition of @xmath57 and @xmath58 modes for @xmath1dy isotope together with various spectroscopic properties , specifically , yrast spectra , reduced @xmath59:@xmath60 transition probabilities , quadrupole moments @xmath61 and gyromagnetic factors @xmath62 of @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd nuclei . the expressions to calculate these spectroscopic properties in the phfb model",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we study the effect of deformation on ntme @xmath3 of @xmath33 decay modes vis - a - vis the changing strength of the @xmath52 interaction .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks are presented in section 4 .",
    "the inverse half - lives for the @xmath22 transition of @xmath33 decay modes are given by @xmath63 ^{-1}=g_{2\\nu } ( \\beta ) \\left| m_{2\\nu } \\right| ^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 denotes @xmath64@xmath10@xmath65@xmath10@xmath66 mode .",
    "the phase space factors @xmath67  have been calculated to good accuracy @xcite and the nuclear model dependent ntme @xmath68 is expressed as    @xmath69    to evaluate equation ( [ m2n ] ) , one has to explicitly sum over all states of the intermediate odd @xmath45-odd @xmath46 nuclei .",
    "however , it is not possible to study the structure of intermediate odd - odd nuclei in the present version of the phfb model .",
    "alternatively , the summation over the intermediate states can be carried out by using the summation method @xcite , when the gt operator commutes with the effective two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "we use the latter procedure to sum over the intermediate states for evaluating the ntme @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "presently , the nuclear wave functions are generated in the hfb framework by using a hamiltonian consisting of an effective two - body interaction with pairing and quadrupolar correlations @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the hamiltonian is written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 @xmath72 and @xmath73 denote the single particle hamiltonian , the pairing and @xmath52 part of the effective two - body interaction .",
    "further , @xmath74 denotes the strength of @xmath52 part of the effective two - body interaction .",
    "the purpose of introducing it is to study the role of deformation by varying the strength parameter @xmath74 .",
    "the final results are obtained by setting the @xmath74 = 1 .    the two - body part of the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( 3 ) contains only pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole interactions .",
    "the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction commutes with the gamow - teller operator ( a complete proof can be found in ref . [ 54 ] ) . in principle",
    ", we should employ a pairing interaction , which includes not only the proton - proton and neutron - neutron t=1 channels , but also proton - neutron t=1 and t=0 channels . with them",
    "a pairing interaction can be built , which commutes with the gt operator [ 56 ] when both channels have the same strengths .",
    "on the other side , it has been shown that both the t=0 and t=1 proton - neutron gaps go to zero [ 57 ] at the mean field level for medium to heavy mass nuclei with @xmath75 .",
    "while it would be very important to include a spin - isospin channel in the hamiltonian , this can be done beyond mean field , for example , by employing the qrpa over the phfb model . for the restricted mean field calculations presented below ,",
    "there is no practical difference in employing the full pairing interaction or pairing only in the proton - proton and neutron - neutron channels . for simplicity",
    ", we use the latter .",
    "it follows that the ntme @xmath3 for the 0@xmath76 transition of @xmath77 decay in the phfb model in conjunction with the summation method is given by @xcite    @xmath78^{-1/2}\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\pi } n_{(z",

    "in the present scheme , the difference in proton and neutron single particle energies with the same quantum numbers corresponding to the energy of the isobaric analog states is well described by the difference in coulomb energy @xmath84 .",
    "further , the spin - orbit energy splitting is added whenever required .",
    "the explicit inclusion of the spin - orbit splitting in the energy denominator of equation ( [ den ] ) , implies that it can not be factorized out of the sum in equation ( [ m2n ] ) . in the present context",
    ", it is noteworthy that the use of the summation method is richer than the closure approximation , because each proton - neutron excitation is weighted depending on its spin - flip or non - spin - flip character , and in addition , employing the summation method in conjunction with the phfb formalism goes beyond what was done in previous applications of the pseudo - su(3 ) model @xcite .",
    "in the hfb framework , the nuclear wave functions for @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd isotopes are generated using the same model space and single particle energies ( spe s ) , but for the spe s of @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 orbits , which are 4.6 mev , 11.0 mev and 11.6 mev , respectively , as in our earlier calculation on @xmath33 decay modes @xcite .",
    "the strengths of the pairing interaction are fixed as @xmath93 mev .",
    "the strengths of the like particle components of the @xmath94 interaction are taken as @xmath95 mev @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is oscillator parameter . for a given model space , spe s , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", we fix the strength of proton - neutron ( @xmath101 ) component of the @xmath52 interaction @xmath102 by reproducing the excitation energy @xmath103 of the 2@xmath104 state .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath102 ( in mev @xmath96 ) for @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd isotopes in the present calculation are 0.01817 and 0.02989 , respectively .",
    "all these input parameters are kept fixed throughout the subsequent calculations .",
    "we present the calculated as well as experimentally observed results for yrast spectra @xcite , reduced @xmath59:@xmath105 transition probabilities @xcite , static quadrupole moments @xmath61 and gyromagnetic factors @xmath106 @xcite of @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd nuclei in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we tabulate only the adopted value for the experimentally observed reduced @xmath59:@xmath105 transition probabilities @xcite .",

    "no experimental @xmath61 result is available for @xmath1dy isotope .",
    "the agreement between the calculated and experimental @xmath61 for @xmath1gd nucleus is also quite good .",
    "however , the calculated gyromagnetic factors @xmath62 for @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd isotopes are off from the experimental data .    in the calculation of @xmath107-factors for @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd isotopes",
    ", we use bare values for @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110(effective)=0.5@xmath110(bare ) and @xmath111(effective)=0.5@xmath111(bare ) .",
    "it is possible to include an effective way the role of higher @xmath112 orbitals not included in the model space , by using a different set of effective gyromagnetic ratios , namely @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath110(effective)=0.5@xmath110(bare ) and @xmath111(effective)=0.8@xmath111(bare ) as suggested by the analysis of rath and sharma @xcite , which can almost reproduce the @xmath107-factors @xmath115 of all considered parent and daughter nuclei in this model space . specifically , the @xmath107-factors @xmath62 for @xmath1dy and @xmath1gd nuclei are 0.399 and 0.424 nm , respectively .    the phase space factors of @xmath57 and @xmath116 modes for @xmath1dy are calculated following the notations of doi _ et al _ @xcite in the approximation @xmath117 @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the calculated phase space factors are @xmath121 y@xmath122 and @xmath123 y@xmath122 .",
