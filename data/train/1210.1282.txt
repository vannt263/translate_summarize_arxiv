    "teleportation of quantum states  @xcite and its remote state preparation variant  @xcite are intriguing concepts within quantum physics and striking applications of quantum entanglement . introduced as `` a term from science fiction , meaning to make a person or object disappear while an exact replica appears somewhere else ''  @xcite ,",
    "quantum teleportation has now become a crucial building block for many quantum information processing schemes .",
    "besides their importance for quantum computation  @xcite , teleportation and entanglement swapping  @xcite are at the heart of the quantum repeater  @xcite , allowing to distribute quantum entanglement over long distances , thus being vital for global quantum communication schemes .",
    "quantum teleportation over longer distances will be needed for the realization of quantum network schemes among several parties  @xcite , which connect devices utilizing quantum computational algorithms .    to realize global quantum communications ,",
    "qubits must be transferred over long distances .",
    "most earlier teleportation experiments are in - lab demonstrations , and hence the communication distance is rather limited .",
    "although fibre - based , long - distance teleportation has been studied experimentally  @xcite , the maximum transmission distance will be ultimately limited by intrinsic photon losses in optical fibre . on the other hand ,",
    "free - space channels are ideal for transmitting photonic qubits due to the low absorption and the weak birefringence of the atmosphere . moreover , in outer space , photon loss and decoherence are negligible . therefore , by using satellites , optical free - space links potentially allow much larger photon propagation distances .    in recent years , there has been significant progress in developing free - space optical links for applications in quantum communications  @xcite .",
    "however , all these previous experiments are utilizing either a single photon or a pair of entangled photons .",
    "a multiphoton , free - space and long - distance quantum teleportation remains an experimental and technical challenge .",
    "this is because of the attenuation of the link , which drastically reduces the detection rate associated with the simultaneous detection of four photons and hence decreases the signal - to - noise ratio .    here",
    "we present an experimental demonstration of quantum teleportation over a high - loss free - space channel , where the two involved laboratories , alice and bob , are separated by 10  m in the basement of one of the buildings owned by austrian academy of sciences ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we simulated the link attenuation by inserting neutral density filters and obtained up to 36  db attenuation .",
    "even under such a high - loss condition , we successfully achieved quantum teleportation .",
    "the task of quantum teleportation is the following .",
    "alice wants to send an unknown quantum state of a particle , provided by charlie , to bob . a trivial way to accomplish that would be to send the particle itself .",
    "if transferring the original particle itself is not possible , she can attempt to clone the quantum state of this particle onto another particle and send it to bob . due to the no - cloning theorem  @xcite",
    ", this procedure will not work with 100% efficiency .",
    "however , quantum teleportation , which is based on both a quantum channel and a classical channel shared by alice and bob , circumvents the no - cloning theorem and provides a solution for such a task .",
    "a detailed explanation can be found in  @xcite .    in our case ,",
    "an entangled photon pair is distributed over the quantum channel .",
    "we use the polarization - entangled state @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the horizontal and vertical polarization states of photon @xmath3 .",
    "alice and bob share this entangled state ( shown in eq .",
    "(  [ bellstate ] ) ) , in that photon 1 is with alice and photon 2 is with bob . in order to transfer the unknown polarization state of charlie s",
    "photon 3 @xmath4 alice performs a joint bell - state measurement ( bsm ) on photons 1 and 3 .",
    "she will randomly observe one out of the four bell - states ( @xmath5 ) , each with the same probability of @xmath6 .",
    "then she employs the classical channel and conveys the results of the bsm to bob . with linear optics",
    "we can only identify two out of four bell states unambiguously  @xcite . in our case",
    ", we choose to identify @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and neglect the results of @xmath9 and @xmath10 since we ca nt identify them with certainty .",
    "note that in the other 50% of the cases , our bsm results in a projection onto a product state ( i.e. @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) , and hence quantum teleportation is impossible .",
    "if alice detects @xmath13 , the state of bob s photon ( photon @xmath14 ) will be the same as the initial state of photon @xmath15 , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ photon3 ] ) , except for an irrelevant global phase factor .",
    "therefore , there will be nothing left to do for bob to complete the teleportation protocol . in the @xmath16 case , the conditional state of bob s photon is @xmath17 and",
    "thus he has to apply a relative @xmath18 phase shift between the polarization components @xmath19 and @xmath20 to convert the state of photon @xmath14 into the original state of photon 3 .",
    "hence , in order to complete quantum teleportation , alice must communicate via classical means to bob which state she observed in her bsm . in accordance to the result of the bsm",

    "the four input states ( @xmath60 ) and their corresponding ( reconstructed ) output states are used to compute analytically the process matrix of quantum teleportation  @xcite .",
    "we can completely describe the effect of teleportation on an input state @xmath61 by determining the process matrix @xmath62 , defined by @xmath63 , where the @xmath55 are the pauli matrices with @xmath64 the identity operator , respectively . to evaluate our process , we take @xmath65 .",

    "a quantum process operating on a single qubit can be conveniently represented graphically by visualizing the deformation of a bloch sphere subjected to the quantum process  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ processtomo](b ) , we represent the initial input states as the states lying on the meshed surface of the bloch sphere .",
    "after teleportation , the initial bloch sphere is deformed into an anisotropic ellipsoid with reduced radius , which corresponds to a reduction of the purity of the teleported state . the reduction of the purity is mainly due to the mixture coming from higher - order emission in the down - conversion process .",
    "note that one can eliminate the degradation of the quantum teleportation process stemming from higher - order emissions from the source of photon 3 by tomographically measuring the input state .",
    "and then one can reconstruct the process using the density matrices of the input and output states , instead of using the ideal and output states .",
    "the classical channel and the feed - forward operation are of crucial importance . without them",
    ", bob can not take into account the result of alice s bsm and thus his quantum state is completely mixed in two of the three mutually unbiased bases and hence the classical limits are not surpassed . in this case ,",
    "quantum teleportation is not successful . for demonstrating this , we obtained data without feed - forward operation . in this case",
    ", bob observes only a completely mixed output state for the input states @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( and all other states in the equatorial plane ) .",
    "however for the @xmath19 or @xmath20 polarized state , the lacking feed - forward is irrelevant .",
    "thus , the teleportation of any @xmath19 or @xmath20 state ( i.e. the north and south pole of the bloch sphere ) will remain unaffected by the lack of feed - forward . the quantum process matrix of teleportation without feed - forward operation is shown in fig .  [ processtomo](c ) .",
    "the main components of the process matrix without feed - forward are the identity ( @xmath64 ) and the phase flipping ( @xmath73 ) operation .",
    "the identity operation component is the result of @xmath7 as the outcome of the bsm , while the phase flipping operation is the result of @xmath8 as the outcome of the bsm . as a consequence of the equal mixture of these two operations ,",
    "the initial input states ( the meshed surface in fig .  [ processtomo](d ) ) are transformed to output states forming a cigar - shaped ellipsoid near the axis of the bloch sphere ( solid blue surface ) . in the equatorial plane of the sphere ,",
    "the radii are close to zero showing that the output states are mixed in the @xmath74 and the @xmath75 bases . in the @xmath28 basis",
    ", it is unaffected as the radii along the axis pointing to both poles are significant .",
    "note that both output state distributions ",
    "the cigar - shape ellipsoid in the case of no feed - forward as well as the more spherical distribution in the case of feed - forward  are tilted with respect to the axis of the bloch sphere of the ideal initial states .",
    "these phenomena are mainly due to polarization drifts of photon 2 in the 50 m delay fiber over long integration time .",
    "quantum teleportation over a high - loss channel is experimentally challenging , because the detection rate is very low , stemming from ( 1 ) the intrinsically low rate of simultaneous emission of four photons from the source , and ( 2 ) the attenuation of the link . note that by using periodically - poled crystals , continuous - wave laser pumped spdc sources could be brighter in the two - fold count rate  @xcite .",
    "but in order to perform multi - photon experiments based on cw pumped system , the timing jitter of commercially available si - apd ( tens to hundreds of ps ) requires very narrow filtering of the down - converted single photons  @xcite , which drastically reduces the useful four - fold coincidence counts and hence makes the realization of quantum teleportation over a high - loss channel even harder .",
    "the two main challenges in our experimental realizations of teleportation over a high - loss link are :    1 .   the extremely low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at bob ; 2 .",
    "the long integration times needed due to the reduced signal .    in",
    "order understand the influence of the attenuation to the teleportation , we developed an analytical model to derive the expected quality based on the photon statistics of spdc .",
    "this model includes the main background contributions for a four - fold coincidence count : second - order emission from spdc and dark counts from bob s detectors , and third - order emission .",
    "the probability of successful teleportation is given as the product of a successful bell state measurement at alice , @xmath76 and the link efficiency from alice to bob , @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding probability to record an error due to noise at bob is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the dark count rate at bob and @xmath80 is the coincidence - window width in time .",
    "thus the snr is given by    @xmath81        in fig .",
    "[ fighighdb ] , we show the teleportation visibility in the case where charlie s input state always was @xmath69 .",
    "( based on the results obtained above , we assume that the quality of our teleportation device is the same for all bases . )",
    "we picked the state @xmath69 , because it is a coherent superposition of the eigenstates of the bsm , which is experimentally challenging , as it requires non - classical two - photon interference .",
    "if , in a classical teleportation protocol , alice does not know the input state , she has to randomly pick a measurement basis and send a corresponding photon to bob",
    ". then the classical average teleported stated fidelity will be @xmath82 .",
    "the classical average visibility is given by @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , if we experimentally obtained a visibility above 1/3 , we achieved quantum teleportation .",
    "one can see that with our current parameters ( the achievable 4-fold count rate , apd dark count rates , coincidence - window width etc ) , teleportation is feasible within a wide range of link attenuation from alice to bob .",
    "one can simulate the experimental situation with the model mentioned above . in fig .",
    "[ fighighdb ] , we show the experimentally obtained visibilities and 4-fold coincidence count rate with the black squares and blue circles , respectively .",
    "the red and the blue curves are the prediction of our model , which shows good agreement with the experimental data .        in order to increase the maximum attenuation where teleportation is still possible , the dark count rate and/or the width of the coincidence time window have to be decreased . to reduce the dark counts ,",
    "first of all the detectors are mounted in a light - isolating box , stopping stray light from the surroundings reaching the detectors .",
    "in addition , we have control over the bias voltage of bob s detectors .",
    "low bias voltage gives lower dark counts , but also reduces the quantum efficiencies of the detectors and hence effectively increases the link attenuation between alice and bob .",
    "also , dark - count rates depend on the cooling temperatures of the apds .",
    "we characterized the quantum efficiency ( relative to a reference detector ) and dark - count rate of bob s detectors and include that into our model . by cooling the apds down to @xmath84 @xmath85c ,",
    "the dark count rates of d5 and d6 are about 180 hz and 400 hz , respectively .",
    "we find the optimal bias voltages and cooling temperatures that give the best snr or , equivalently , the best teleportation results under a given amount of attenuation . by using alternative apds  @xcite or stronger",
    "cooling means  @xcite , one can further reduce the dark counts and improve the snr . we did not include the inefficient detectors and loss from bob s optical elements in the attenuation analysis in any of our experiments .",
    "the attenuations we specified include only the attenuations induced by using the neutral density filter and the free - space link .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqsnr ] ) , one can see that another important factor is the temporal length of the coincidence - window width , @xmath80 .",
    "we use a time - tagging unit to record the arrival time of the bsm results and bob s detection events relative to an internal clock with 156 ps resolution .",
    "then we process the cross - correlations of these time stamps with different coincidence - window width . as shown in fig .",
    "[ visvsccw](a ) and [ visvsccw](b ) , the visibility and the number of standard deviations violating the classical bound ( corresponding to a visibility of 1/3 ) drop as we increase the size of the coincidence time window , respectively .",
    "note that there is an obvious drop in both visibility and number of the standard deviations due to the increased accidental coincidence counts between consecutive laser pulses , which are separated by 12.5 ns .    in conclusion",
    ", we present a high - fidelity quantum teleportation experiment over a high - loss free - space channel .",
    "our work is an important step towards future quantum teleportation experiment between satellites and ground stations .",
    "the expected optical link attenuation between a ground based transmitter ( sending aperture with 100 cm in diameter ) to a low earth orbiting ( leo ) satellite receiver ( receiving aperture with 13 cm in diameter ) is about @xmath86  db  @xcite .",
