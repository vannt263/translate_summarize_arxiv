    "are those pairs containing both a bridge and a collisional ring .",
    "the location of the bridge in a bridge / ring system may indicate which of multiple companions collided with the ring galaxy , as in the cartwheel galaxy ( higdon 1996 ) and in vii zw 466 ( appleton et al .",
    "1996 ) , while the composition of the bridge may provide clues to how it formed .",
    "two different mechanisms are capable of creating bridges between galaxies . as discussed by toomre @xmath5 toomre ( 1972 ) ,",
    "tidal forces and spin - orbit coupling during an encounter are capable of drawing both gas and stars out into a bridge .",
    "a well - known example of a tidal bridge is found in the m51 system ( toomre @xmath5 toomre 1972 ) .",
    "tidal bridges have been modeled in detail by barnes @xmath5 hernquist ( 1991 ) and mihos @xmath5 hernquist ( 1996 ) using a hybrid n - body / hydrodynamical code . in these simulations , the impact parameters used are greater than the disk radii , so an immediate collision between the two galaxies does not occur .",
    "the second type of bridge , a ` splash ' bridge , is the result of a purely hydrodynamical effect and occurs during smaller impact parameter encounters ( appleton et al .",
    "1996 ; struck 1996a , 1996b ) . in this version of the standard ring galaxy model ,",
    "both galaxies initially contain gaseous disks . during the passage of the smaller galaxy through the larger disk , gas clouds from the two galaxies",

    "the hi bridges seen in the cartwheel ( higdon 1996 ) and vii zw 466 systems ( appleton et al .",
    "1996 ) may be this type of bridge , rather than tidal bridges ( struck 1996a ; struck et al .",
    "1996 ) , because the observed bridges are purely gaseous .    in this paper",
    ", we present new 21 cm hi and narrowband optical images of the bridge / ring system ngc 7714/7715 ( arp 284 ) , and discuss them in the context of ring and bridge formation models .",
    "this system differs dramatically from the cartwheel and vii zw 466 systems in having a prominent stellar bridge as well as only a partial ring ( arp 1966 ) . in addition , ngc 7714 differs from the other two galaxies by having tidal tails ( arp 1966 ) and a strong bar ( bushouse @xmath5 werner 1990 ) .",
    "this complex morphology may have been caused by a more off - center encounter than that which produced the more symmetric rings in the cartwheel and vii zw 466 . in smith @xmath5 wallin ( 1992 ;",
    "hereafter paper i ) , we used a restricted 3-body model to simulate the ngc 7714/7715 encounter , and successfully reproduced the observed optical structure with an off - center ( impact parameter r@xmath6 @xmath7 0.85 times the radius of the larger disk ) inclined collision between two unequal - mass disk galaxies ( m@xmath8/m@xmath9 @xmath7 0.3 ) .",
    "ngc 7714/7715 is somewhat reminiscent of the ` sacred mushroom ' galaxy am  1724 - 622 ( arp @xmath5 madore 1986 ) , which also contains a ring and a stellar bridge .",
    "am  1724 - 622 , however , does not have tidal tails and therefore may have undergone a less off - center ( r@xmath10 @xmath7 0.5 r@xmath11 ) collision than ngc 7714/7715 ( wallin @xmath5 struck - marcell 1994 ) .",
    "the distribution of star formation in ngc 7714 also differs from that in many ring galaxies .",
    "in contrast to the outer ring in the cartwheel ( fosbury @xmath5 hawarden 1977 ; higdon 1995 ) and the ring galaxies surveyed by marston @xmath5 appleton ( 1995 ) , the ngc 7714 ring does not have on - going star formation ( bushouse @xmath5 werner 1990 ; bernlhr 1993 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "the near - infrared colors of the ngc 7714 ring imply a considerable older stellar component ( bushouse @xmath5 werner 1990 ) , while the cartwheel s outer ring is primarily composed of young stars ( marcum , appleton , @xmath5 higdon 1992 ; higdon 1995 ) .",
    "the ngc 7714 ring resembles the inner ring of the cartwheel , which has an older stellar population ( marcum et al .",
    "1992 ) and little star formation ( higdon 1995 ) , as well as the ring in am  1724 - 622 , which is also composed of mainly older stars ( wallin @xmath5 struck - marcell 1994 ) .",
    "star formation in ngc 7714 is occurring at the nucleus , near the northern end of the bar , and at the base of the southwestern tidal tail instead of in the ring ( bushouse @xmath5 werner 1990 ; bernlhr 1993 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "the luminous starburst nucleus in this galaxy is well - studied ( french 1980 ; weedman et al . 1981 ; keel 1984 ; de robertis @xmath5 shaw 1988 ) and is known to contain wolf - rayet stars ( van breugel et al .",
    "1985 ; gonzlez - delgado et al . 1995 ) .",
    "luminous hii regions are also seen in the bridge between the two galaxies but not in the companion ngc 7715 ( arp 1966 ; bernlhr 1993 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "ngc 7715 has no optical emission lines ( humanson , mayall , @xmath5 sandage 1956 ; bernlhr 1993 ) ; spectral synthesis indicates that it is in a post - starburst stage , with a large population of a and late - type b stars ( bernlhr 1993 ) .",
    "most of the far - infrared emission from this system arises from ngc 7714 ( surace et al .",
    "1993 ) .    in our previous study of this system ( paper i )",
    ", we presented low resolution ( 40@xmath12 ) 21 cm hi maps obtained with the nrao very large array ( vla ) in the d array configuration .",
    "these observations showed that the atomic hydrogen in this system is very extended , reaching out to a maximum radius of 6@xmath13 ( @xmath770 kpc ) . between the two galaxies ,",
    "a gaseous bridge is seen . in spite of its high star formation rate , ngc 7714",
    "is relatively weak in the standard tracer of molecular gas , the millimeter co ( 1 @xmath14 0 ) line ( sanders , scoville , @xmath5 soifer 1991 ; young @xmath5 devereux 1991 ) . the m@xmath15/m@xmath16 ratio in the inner 45@xmath12 has the unusually low value of 0.75 , assuming the standard galactic i@xmath17/n@xmath15 ratio ( paper i ) .",
    "this may be due to the low metallicity of this system ( weedman et al .",
    "1991 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1995 ) rather than a true deficiency of molecular gas ( paper i ) .",
    "interferometric observations show that the co peak in ngc 7714 is a few arcseconds north of the optical and radio continuum nucleus , and is extended about 10@xmath12 east - west with a spur extending south towards the nucleus ( ishizuki 1993 ) .",
    "the vla and optical observations of ngc 7714/7715 are described in section 2 of this paper , while the data are described in section 3 . to better understand the role of tidal and hydrodynamical effects in shaping the gas morphology of this system , in section 4 we present a hydrodynamical model of a low mass disk galaxy impacting the outer disk of a larger galaxy .",
    "implications of the observations and model are discussed in section 5 , and conclusions given in section 6 . table 1 provides some basic information about the two galaxies in this system . a distance to these galaxies of 37 mpc is assumed throughout this paper ( h@xmath18 = 75 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 ) .",

    "3c 286 and 3c 48 were each observed for 20 minutes for flux and bandpass calibration , and a nearby phase calibrator was observed every 30 minutes for 5 minutes . on - line hanning smoothing was used for the observations , giving 63 channels with a resolution of 10.5 km s@xmath19 and a total bandwidth of 655 km s@xmath19 centered at 2800 km s@xmath19 .",
    "calibration and mapping were accomplished using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "after calibration , the first step in the data reduction was to make a continuum map from 21 line - free channels near the ends of the bandpass .",
    "this map was then cleaned ( clark 1980 ) and the clean components were subtracted from the original uv database . a set of continuum - free maps",
    "were then constructed and residual continuum emission removed .",

    "the hi morphology of this system is very disturbed and the gas extends well beyond the main optical disks of the galaxies .",
    "particularly prominent in these maps is an hi bridge between the two galaxies .",
    "this bridge is offset @xmath710@xmath12 ( 1.8  kpc ) to the north of the optical bridge ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the h@xmath2 sources apparent in the bridge lie near , but not on , the hi peaks ( figure 5b ) .",
    "massive star formation is occuring in the gaseous bridge rather than in the more southern stellar bridge .",
    "this effect is also seen in the arp atlas ( arp 1966 ) photograph of ngc 7714 ; the h  ii regions lie to the north of the smoother stellar bridge .",
    "tidal hi is seen in other locations as well .",
    "strong hi is observed in a prominent countertail to the east of ngc 7715 .",
    "this feature is hereafter named the ` eastern cloud ' .",
    "hi is relatively weak at ngc 7715 ; in the less sensitive b array data a gap is observed between the eastern cloud and the bridge . in the higher sensitivity b+c+d array data this gap",
    "is filled in with more diffuse gas .",
    "as at the bridge , the gas appears skewed to the north relative to the optical light throughout both ngc 7715 and the eastern tail .    on the other side of the system , there is a bright arc or loop of hi 1@xmath13 northwest of ngc 7714 ( the ` northwestern loop ' ) .",
    "the smoothed poss image ( figure 6 ) shows a possible optical counterpart to this hi loop . finally , to the far west ,",
    "there are numerous hi clouds that extend several arcminutes from the center of ngc 7714 ( figure 4b ) .",
    "our data also provide a closer look at ngc 7714 itself .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show an apparent hi hole at the optical nucleus of ngc 7714 ; this depression may be due to hi absorption ( see section 3.5 ) . in the disk of ngc 7714",
    ", the hi is not confined to a bar or to an hi ring tracing the optical ring ( figure 5a ) . instead ,",
    "the gas is quite clumpy , with two hi holes at the outer edge of the stellar ring and another depression near the southern end of the bar ( figure 5a ) . south of the ring there is an arc of gas extending to the southeast ( the ` southeastern arc ' ) .",
    "particularly large clumps of gas are seen near the star formation regions northwest and southwest of the nucleus ( the ` northwestern ' and ` southwestern clumps ' ) .",
    "the southwestern clump lies at the base of the optical tail . in these regions ,",
    "the h@xmath2 peaks are close to but not coincident with the hi peaks .",
    "there is also an hi peak inside the ring ( figure 5a ) .",
    "there is a small hii region outside of this hi clump , on the inner edge of the ring ( figure 5b ) .",
    "this clump of gas may be foreground or background bridge material rather than disk gas , and may not lie in the same plane as the ring .",
    "its presence therefore complicates the search for a gaseous counterpart to the ring .",
    "we find a total hi flux for this system of 21.8 jy km s@xmath19 , comparable to the 10@xmath13 aperture single dish measurements of 17.9 jy km s@xmath19 ( peterson @xmath5 shostak 1974 ) and 21.0 jy km s@xmath19 ( bushouse 1987 ) .",
    "the hi masses and peak column densities of the various structures are given in table 3 .",
    "more than half of the total atomic gas in the system lies outside of the optical disks .",
    "the hi masses of the bridge and the western loop are especially large , greater than 10@xmath3 m@xmath1 . the peak hi column density in the bridge , 5.4 @xmath20 10@xmath23 @xmath24 in a 6@xmath12 beam , is particularly high .      in figure 7",
    ", the hi velocity profiles for various structures in the ngc 7714/7715 system are shown .",
    "the peak velocities and fwhm line widths of these features are included in table 3 .",
    "the total profile agrees with the single dish observations of peterson @xmath5 shostak ( 1974 ) .",
    "the gas in the bridge and eastern cloud is quite confined in velocity , as is typical of tidal features , while the western loop has a relatively broad velocity profile .",
    "the profiles for the individual clumps in the ngc 7714 disk are relatively narrow .    in figures 8a and 8b , we plot the hi velocity field with the narrowband optical continuum map and the b+c+d array hi intensity map , respectively .",
    "east to west across the system from the eastern cloud through the bridge , a shallow velocity gradient of 3.5 km s@xmath19 kpc@xmath19 is observed , with the gas in the eastern cloud being more blueshifted . at ngc 7715",
    "the gas is more redshifted than expected by this trend ( figure 8a ) .",
    "across the optical body of ngc 7715 , the velocity field suggests rotation with a line of nodes parallel to the major axis of the galaxy and the western side redshifted ( figure 8a ) .",
    "a velocity change of 50 km s@xmath19 is observed over 20@xmath12 ( 3.6 kpc ) , and the systemic velocity is 2800 km s@xmath19 , equal to that of ngc 7714 .",
    "thus the kinematics of the gas in the immediate vicinity of ngc 7715 appear distinct from those of the surrounding extended gas .    in the disk of ngc 7714 , the velocity field indicates the presence of an inclined rotating disk of gas , with more redshifted gas to the northwest .",
    "the line of nodes is approximately parallel to the bar , at a position angle of @xmath7132@xmath25 in the inner disk , decreasing slightly with increasing radius .",
    "the velocity field shows maxima and minima beyond the end of the bar at radii of 15@xmath12 @xmath14 20@xmath12 , suggesting that the rotation curve turns over at that radius .",
    "relative to the systemic velocity , the maximum rotational velocity uncorrected for inclination is 60 km s@xmath19 .",
    "the most redshifted gas in the system is in the northwestern loop .",
    "east to west along this loop the velocities increase until the point at which the loop bends southward . after that location the gas becomes increasingly blueshifted as the loop arcs southward and connects back to the main galaxy .",
    "the position of maximum redshift does not lie along the line of nodes defined by the inner disk , but instead is rotated 20@xmath25 to the southwest . in the far western hi clouds , the velocity gradient is such that the most northern gas is more redshifted than that in the south .    in figures 8a and 8b , significant deviations from circular motion are observed .",
    "note the particularly strong peculiar motions at the location of the gaseous bridge ( figure 8b ) .",
    "figure 8a also shows some curvature in the isovelocity contours at the stellar ring .",
    "in addition , there are deviations near the southwestern hi clump , where the gas is more redshifted than expected ( figure 8b ) .",
    "these deviations may be caused by a combination of non - planar and radial motions .",
    "it is probable that the gas in the bridge lies in a different plane than the gas in the disk of ngc 7714 , and the disk of ngc 7714 itself may be warped .",
    "second , radial motions may be present along the bridge , in the ring , and along the tails . because of the uncertain geometry of the system it is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities .    from the hi velocity field ,",
    "we have derived a rotation curve for the inner disk of ngc 7714 ( figure 9 ) .",
    "we used a tilted ring model as in begeman ( 1989 ) and weighted the data by the cosine of the azimuthal angle with maximum weighting along the major axis .",
    "because of the observed deviations from circular motion , we do not iteratively fit all the required parameters for this curve . instead , we assume that the dynamical center is coincident with the radio continuum nucleus ( condon et al .",
    "1990 ; table 1 ) , the systemic velocity is 2800 km s@xmath19 , and the line of nodes is fixed at a position angle of 132@xmath25 east of north ( figure 8b ) .",
    "we also require the inclination to be fixed at 30@xmath25",
    ". this inclination may be reasonable for the disk of ngc 7714 itself ( paper i ) , but may well differ at larger radii as indicated by the observed distortions to the velocity field .",
    "therefore , in figure 9 we only plot the rotation curve out to a radius of 30@xmath12 .",
    "this curve shows a smooth increase in velocity to a radius of 16@xmath12 where it drops off slightly .      in figure 10 , we plot the continuum - subtracted hi spectrum for the central position of ngc 7714 .",
    "a weak absorption line with an optical depth of 0.062 @xmath26 0.016 and a velocity width of 40 km s@xmath19 is apparent at a velocity redshifted 100 km s@xmath19 with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this redshift suggests that gas is infalling onto the starburst nucleus .",
    "assuming a spin temperature of 100k , we find an absorbing column density n(hi ) of 4.7 @xmath26 1.2 @xmath20 10@xmath27 @xmath24 towards the nucleus .",
    "redshifted hi absorption lines towards nuclear radio continuum sources are not uncommon , and are more often redshifted than blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( dickey 1986 ; van gorkom et al .",
    "1989 ; smith 1994 ) .",
    "no hi absorption is seen towards the background continuum sources .",
    "both the stars and the gas in this system appear to be distributed in a highly nonequilibrium and short - lived manner . moreover , there are large differences in the distribution of the two components . to understand the dynamical processes that produced these morphologies and to relate this system to other collisional galaxies , detailed comparisons between the data and numerical simulations of galaxy interactions are important . in paper",
    "i , we presented a restricted 3-body model of this interaction which reproduced the stellar structure of this system . to understand the behavior of the gas , however , a more sophisticated numerical model which includes hydrodynamical effects",
    "is required .",
    "unfortunately , encounters with interaction parameters appropriate for this system have not yet been investigated with hydrodynamical modeling studies .",
    "previously published hydrodynamical models of interacting galaxies have concentrated on either small impact parameter collisions ( r@xmath6 @xmath28 0.5 r@xmath11 ) ( appleton @xmath5 struck - marcell 1987 ; struck - marcell @xmath5 appleton 1987 ; gerber , lamb , @xmath5 balsara 1992 , 1996 ; struck - marcell @xmath5 higdon 1993 ; hernquist @xmath5 weil 1993 ; appleton et al .",

    "earlier versions of this code were used to model the cartwheel ( struck - marcell @xmath5 higdon 1993 ) and vii zw 466 ( appleton et al .",
    "1996 ) systems .",
    "the large - scale collisional dynamics are simulated with a restricted 3-body approximation , while local self - gravity between neighboring gas particles is included .",
    "simplified treatments of gas heating and cooling are also included .",
    "stars are represented as collisionless gas particles which do not participate in heating or cooling .",
    "the gas / star particle ratio is about 3/1 and the stellar disk is half the size of the gaseous disk .",
    "the primary galaxy contains 13,600 gas particles , while the companion has 4000 .    in this simulation",
    ", we used a galaxy mass ratio m@xmath8/m@xmath9 = 0.3 and an impact parameter r@xmath6 = 0.98 r@xmath30 = 0.5 r@xmath31 .",
    "the inclination of the companion s orbit relative to the main disk = 120@xmath25 and the inclination of the larger disk relative to the plane of the sky = 30@xmath25 .",
    "the initial orientation of the companion is 25@xmath25 out of the x@xmath14z plane ( the x@xmath14y plane is assumed to be the plane of the sky ) . as in the paper i model , the encounter is retrograde with respect to the main galaxy and prograde with respect to the smaller galaxy .",
    "in contrast to the models in struck ( 1996a , 1996b ) , for this simulation we used a softened point mass potential rather than a rigid halo .    our final model is shown in figure 11 .",
    "the four panels show different particle sets , all at the same timestep .",
    "figure 11a shows the stellar distribution in the x@xmath14y plane , while figures 11b and 11c show two orthogonal views of the gas distribution , in the x@xmath14y and x@xmath14z planes . in these figures ,",
    "the near side of the larger disk is to the left and its rotation is clockwise on the sky , while the lower side of the smaller galaxy is closer , with counterclockwise rotation .",
    "figure 11d shows an expanded x - y view of the bridge , with both stars and gas .",
    "the time displayed is 10@xmath32 yrs after the point of closest approach , assuming a mass of about 1.2 @xmath20 10@xmath33 m@xmath1 contained within the main stellar disk .    following impact , the stellar morphology of this model developed in a manner very similar to that in the paper i model .",
    "specifically , a ring and two projecting spiral arms develop in the primary stellar disk , while stars from the companion form a stellar bridge and a countertail .",
    "the gas distribution is qualitatively similar to that of the stars , but with some important differences .",
    "the gas arms are longer , as expected for the more extended gas disk .",
    "there is also a partial ring of gas in the disk of the main galaxy , which lies somewhat to the outside of the stellar ring .",
    "gas is also found in the bridge between the two galaxies , but , unlike the stars in the bridge , this gas originates in both galaxies .",
    "as in the struck ( 1996a , 1996b ) models , gas has been splashed from both galaxies into the bridge by the collision of the two disks .    by varying the initial orbital , disk , and viewing parameters , we are able to change the position of the stellar bridge relative to the gaseous bridge . in particular , the location of the stellar bridge is determined in part by the initial orientation of the companion galaxy , while the impact position and rotation of the main disk affect the location of the splash bridge . in the model shown , an offset between the centroids of the gas bridge and the stellar bridge is apparent , with the stars shifted to the top of the page relative to the gas .",
    "this offset is caused by dissipative collisions between gas clouds during the encounter ; the gas from the companion becomes displaced from the stars .",
    "one of the most striking results of this study is the observation of a very gas - rich bridge connecting ngc 7714 and ngc 7715 . in this bridge ,",
    "the gas and stars are offset by @xmath72 kpc .",
    "the hi column density in this bridge ( @xmath75 @xmath20 10@xmath23 @xmath24 ) is very high compared to other such features .",
    "it is about an order of magnitude higher than that observed in the cartwheel ( higdon 1996 ) and vii zw 466 ( appleton et al .",
    "1996 ) bridges and in many tidal tails ( e.g. , hibbard et al .",
    "1994 ; smith 1994 ; hibbard @xmath5 van gorkom 1996 ) , but is comparable to the hi column density observed in the bridge of the ` taffy ' galaxies , ugc 12914/5 , another possible bridge / ring system ( condon et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the ngc 7714/7715 bridge is clearly not a purely ` splash ' bridge , as in the models of struck ( 1996a , 1996b ) , because of the existence of the pronounced stellar bridge .",
    "it is also probably not a purely tidal bridge ; the presence of a stellar ring in ngc 7714 suggests an impact parameter @xmath28 r@xmath11 and therefore a collision of the two gaseous disks .",
    "our hydrodynamical model of an off - center collision between two disk galaxies ( section 4 ) produces a connecting bridge with both stars and gas .",
    "the bridge gas in this model originated in both galaxies , while the stars came from only the companion .",
    "we therefore suggest that the bridge in ngc 7714/7715 is a combination of a tidal bridge and a ` splash ' bridge , where the stellar bridge has been drawn out by tidal forces and both tidal and hydrodynamical processes created the gaseous bridge . the observed separation between the gas and stars in the ngc 7714/7715 bridge",
    "is produced naturally in such a scenario , because the stars and gas in the bridge did not all originate from the same galaxy and because the cross - section of gas is much larger than the cross - section of stars .",
    "other alternative explanations for the gas / star shift in the ngc 7714/7715 bridge are less likely .",
    "an interaction with an intergalactic medium may cause an offset , however , ngc 7714/7715 is an isolated pair , not in a cluster , so one would not expect significant stripping by intergalactic gas .",
    "gas depletion by star formation on the southern edge of bridge could also create the offset .",
    "it is likely , however , that the stars in the stellar bridge predate the interaction and were not formed in situ .",
    "this possibility should be tested with broadband optical and near - infrared mapping of the bridge .",
    "gas / star offsets are not uncommon in tidal features .",
    "a gas / star shift is observed along about one quarter of the 3@xmath13 ( 80 kpc ) long arp 295 bridge ( hibbard @xmath5 van gorkom 1996 ) , and similar offsets between the stars and gas have been seen in the tidal tails of a few interacting systems ( wever et al .",
    "1984 ; hibbard @xmath5 van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "although these are not ring galaxies , a similar mechanism may be responsible for the observed offsets in some cases : collisions may occur between clouds from the two galaxies when the approach distance is small enough .",
    "in one of the larger impact parameter models of mihos @xmath5 hernquist ( 1996 ) , a pronounced offset between the stars and gas in the bridge is produced by collisions between clouds on intersecting orbits . in many tails",
    "no offset is seen ( hibbard @xmath5 van gorkom 1996 ) , so observing such an offset may depend on the geometry of the encounter , the gas content , and the timescale .",
    "the ngc 7714/7715 interaction is very favorable for the observation of this effect , because of the relatively small impact parameter ( r@xmath6 @xmath28 r@xmath11 ) compared to non - colliding interacting pairs .      in both the tidal ( hernquist @xmath5 barnes 1991 ; mihos @xmath5 hernquist 1996 ) and collisional ( struck 1996a , 1996b ) models of bridge formation , accretion from the bridge onto the galaxies",
    "is expected . in our hi data ,",
    "we see deviations from circular motion at the bridge , but , as noted in section 3.4 , because of the uncertain geometry of the system it is unclear whether these deviations imply radial motion or simply non - planar circular motion .",
    "the interaction is mainly occuring in the plane of the sky , and it is uncertain whether ngc 7714 or ngc 7715 is closer to us . therefore , our data are inconclusive on the question of gas accretion onto the galaxies from the bridge .",
    "ngc 7714 has two partial rings : a stellar ring to the east , and a larger gaseous ring to the northwest .",
    "as noted previously , these rings differ from those in many ring galaxies in not having on - going star formation . like the non - star - forming inner ring of the cartwheel but unlike the cartwheel s outer ring ( higdon 1996 ) , the optical ring in ngc 7714 does not have a prominent hi counterpart . instead , hi depressions are observed on the outer edge of the ring and at the southern end of the bar .",
    "our hydrodynamical model of an off - center collision ( section 4 ) shows that such differentiation of gas and stars is expected in partial rings formed during very off - center collisions .",
    "thus the lack of an hi counterpart does not rule out a collisional origin for the ngc 7714 ring .",
    "this point will be investigated further in future modeling studies .",
    "one of the best methods of testing the collisional ring hypothesis is to search for kinks in the velocity field across the rings . in the more symmetrical ring galaxy the cartwheel ,",
    "such kinks are observed and are consistent with expansion ( higdon 1996 ) . in ngc 7714 ,",
    "the data are inconclusive on this point .",
    "the isovelocity contours do curve slightly when crossing the stellar ring ( figure 8a ) , and the gas is slightly blueshifted at the ring relative to circular motion , implying expansion , if one assumes the ngc 7714 tails are trailing .",
    "however , interpretation is complicated by the fact that large peculiar motions are seen in the nearby bridge , making it hard to separate possible radial or non - planar motions in the bridge from those in the ring .",
    "also , the fact that the gas in the vicinity of the stellar ring is not confined to a ring - like structure makes interpretation of its motions uncertain . the isovelocity curves across the northwestern loop also do not show pronounced kinks , thus neither ring shows clear evidence for expansion .",
    "the fact that these are asymmetric rings likely caused by a very off - center encounter may also contribute to the lack of clearly defined velocity deviations at the rings .",
    "another possibility is that the stellar ring in this system is simply a wrapped - around spiral arm caused by a non - collisional prograde planar encounter , as in some of the models of thomson @xmath5 wright ( 1990 ) , donner , engstrm , @xmath5 sundelius ( 1991 ) , elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and howard et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , rather than a collisional ring . the high column density of gas in the bridge , however , and its offset from the stars , supports the idea that gas was forced out of the main galaxy by a collision between two gas disks rather than merely perturbed in a grazing or long - range encounter .",
    "this possibility should be investigated further with hydrodynamical simulations of such encounters .",
    "in this paper , we have presented both optical and 21 cm hi maps of the interacting pair ngc 7714/7715 .",
    "this pair is connected by two bridges : a gaseous bridge , in which star formation is on - going , and a stellar bridge , which is parallel to but displaced 10@xmath12 ( 1.8 kpc ) to the south of the gaseous bridge .",
    "this offset persists 27 ( 30 kpc ) from the bridge through ngc 7715 and the countertail east of ngc 7715 . in the main body of ngc 7714",
    ", there is no prominent hi counterpart to the stellar ring .",
    "instead , we find a clumpy interstellar medium with maxima near the prominent star formation complexes in the disk , and a prominent hi loop on the opposite side of the galaxy .",
    "we also detect redshifted hi absorption towards the ngc 7714 nucleus , suggesting infall onto the starburst nucleus .",
    "the velocity field of the inner disk of ngc 7714 shows the standard ` spider diagram ' signature of an inclined rotating disk . at radii larger than 20@xmath12 ( 3.5 kpc ) pronounced deviations from circular motion",
    "are present , particularly at the bridge , indicating nonplanar and/or radial motions .",
    "signs of rotation are also observed at ngc 7715 .",
    "the gas in the immediate vicinity of ngc 7715 appears kinematically distinct from the gas in the surrounding extended structures .",
    "we suggest that the peculiar morphology of this system is the result of a very off - center collision between two gas - rich disk galaxies .",
    "our numerical simulations indicate that such collisions can create bridge / ring systems similar to ngc 7714/7715 , in which the bridge contains both gas and stars .",
    "we conclude that the bridge in ngc 7714/7715 is a hybrid between classical tidal bridges , such as that in seen in m51 , and gaseous ` splash ' bridges observed in ring galaxies such as the cartwheel .",
    "the observed offset between the gas and stars in this bridge may have been caused by dissipative collisions between gas clouds from the two galaxies .",
    "further investigations of the interaction parameters for the ngc 7714/7715 encounter are needed to better define the roles of tidal ` swing ' and collisional ` splash ' in the ngc 7714/7715 bridge , and to better match the details of the system .",
