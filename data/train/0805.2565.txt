    "the anomalous behaviour of water has attracted the attention of scientists since long time .",
    "many fascinating features distinguish water from most other liquids . among them",
    "we point out the presence of a line of temperatures of maximum density ( tmd ) in the @xmath0 plane and the power law divergences upon supercooling of the coefficient of thermal expansion , of the specific heat and of the isothermal compressibility .",
    "@xcite    molecular dynamics simulations of water modeled with st2 , spc / e , tip4p and tip5p potentials have shown the existence of a second critical point  @xcite buried inside the supercooled region with a coexistence between a low density liquid ( ldl ) and a high density liquid ( hdl ) . the deep supercooled region is not directly accessible to experiments , nonetheless signatures of the second critical point have been observed .",
    "@xcite in this picture water anomalies are a direct consequence of the existence of the second critical point in the region of low temperatures and high pressures , the water spinodal line is non - reentrant and correspondingly the tmd line bends to avoid crossing the spinodal line .",
    "being water a rather unique solvent , the properties of aqueous solutions are also a topic of substantive interest . in particular thermodynamic and structural properties of aqueous solutions of electrolytes are of importance because of the ubiquitous presence of these solutions in biological and geophysical systems .",
    "besides the properties of aqueous solutions upon supercooling are significant for cryopreservation of biological tissues .",
    "@xcite    as far as water itself is concerned it is well known that the presence of solutes affects important properties like melting point , boiling point and viscosity .",
    "it is therefore important to understand to what extent thermodynamic properties of water are affected by the solutes upon supercooling .",
    "in fact while many studies in literature concentrate on ionic solutions at ambient temperature , very little has been done in the supercooled region .",
    "differential scanning calorimeter measurements have shown  @xcite that for low nacl content , up to about 1 @xmath1 , at ambient pressure , the tmd and the anomalous behaviour of specific heat upon supercooling are still present , gradually tending to disappear upon increasing the salt content .",
    "a large number of experiments and simulations focus on the hydration structure  @xcite at ambient temperature of ionic solutions , that is to say on the arrangement of water molecules in proximity to the ions . at low concentrations",
    "the presence of the ions perturbs the structure of water only locally , while it remains unaltered far away from the ions .",
    "@xcite    traditionally , ions have been divided in structure - making ( or cosmotrope ) and structure - breaking ( or chaotrope ) depending on the effect they have on water - water hydrogen bonds .",
    "the first appearance of these concept dates back to the hofmeister s series .",
    "@xcite more than thirty effects connected to the hofmeister s series  @xcite can be found , nevertheless its greatest significance resides in the different degree of hydration of ionic compounds in aqueous solutions . although some authors  @xcite questioned the significance of the structure - making / breaking concept , mainly because of the difficulty in quantifying correlated properties , the majority of studies apply the usual definition .",
    "@xcite structure - making ions break the hydrogen bonds of surrounding water molecules , thus allowing a rearrangement of water molecules that results in a ordered hydration structure .",
    "structure - breaking ions , bend without breaking the hydrogen bonds of nearby water molecules , thus disordering the tetrahedrally coordinated network .",
    "so far it is not clear whether and how structure - making / breaking properties of ions are connected to modifications of thermodynamic properties of the solvent upon supercooling .",
    "we present here a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation study of an aqueous sodium chloride solution , in the following denoted as nacl(aq ) , upon supercooling .",
    "the salt content in the aqueous solution amounts to @xmath2 .",
    "its thermodynamic and structural properties are compared to a md simulation of bulk water .",
    "the isotherms and the isochores are studied for both systems to investigate whether and to what extent the thermodynamic properties of water upon supercooling are modified in presence of a low concentration of ions .",
    "the analysis of the phase diagrams leads to the determination the tmd line and the spinodal line .",
    "the structural properties are also studied , calculating the partial radial distribution functions , rdfs , of water molecules around the ions .",
    "the rdfs features are analysed also taking into account the structure - making properties of the @xmath3 and the structure - breaking properties of the @xmath4 ions .",

    "the isotherms of the nacl(aq ) system appear in fact closer to each other than in the bulk phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] we present a zoom of the region of the @xmath21 phase diagram in the density range @xmath31 , in order to compare the isotherms of the two systems at high densities . in both systems",
    "the @xmath32  k and the @xmath15  k curves cross the higher temperature isotherms and change the sign of their curvature .",
    "these effects are particularly evident for the bulk @xmath32  k and @xmath15  k isotherms and the nacl(aq ) @xmath32  k isotherm . in bulk water these changes of curvatures",
    "have been already observed  @xcite and related to the existence of a second critical point .",
    "in fact they are signatures of the approach of the system to the coexistence between low an high density liquid phases .",
    "therefore we hypothesize also for the nacl(aq ) the existence of a second critical point . for the change of curvature",
    "a shift toward higher densities can be noticed in the aqueous solution .",
    "this observation leads to infer that also the second critical point might consequently be shifted to a higher density with respect to the position in the bulk .",
    "we now consider the isochores of the nacl(aq ) and the pure water systems reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] respectively .",
    "the behaviour of the tmd line can be extracted from the analysis of the isochores plane .",
    "in fact along the tmd line the coefficient of thermal expansion @xmath33 goes to zero .",
    "the thermal pressure coefficient @xmath34 is connected to the coefficient of thermal expansion by the following equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the isothermal compressibility . therefore the tmd points lie on the line connecting the minima of the isochores .",
    "for both systems the minima have been determined fitting the isochores with a fourth order polynomial function .    for the aqueous solution the isochores in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] are shown from @xmath37 to @xmath38 in the temperature ranges from @xmath23  k to @xmath15  k. the @xmath38 isochore almost coincides with the spinodal line ( see fig .",

    "are not reported since they lie beyond the mechanical stability limit of the system .    for bulk water",
    "we observe a spinodal extending to the region of negative pressures and non reentrant down to the lowest temperature investigated .",
    "this behaviour has been already observed in literature for different potentials .",
    "@xcite also the aqueous solution displays a non reentrant spinodal line qualitatively similar to the bulk .    in the case of the aqueous solution",
    "all the isochores above @xmath38 exhibit a clear minimum .",
    "this result agrees with the experimental work by archer and carter  @xcite in which they find a tmd line for the solution at the concentration studied here . from the minima , via a fitting procedure , we determine the exact location of the tmd .",
    "we observe that the tmd line , reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , reverts its path avoiding the spinodal .    in the case of pure water ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) only for the first four isochores a minimum is found in the range of temperatures explored .",
    "the shape of the tmd line is in agreement with the results that can be found in literature .",
    "@xcite    the comparison of the isochores planes of nacl(aq ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) and bulk water ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) reveals that in the @xmath0 plane the isochores of nacl(aq ) lie at lower pressures than the corresponding bulk curves .",
    "besides , the concavity of the isochores in proximity to the minima is deeper in bulk water than in nacl(aq ) .",
    "this is mirrored by the different pattern followed by the tmd line in the two systems .",
    "the location of the second critical point for bulk tip4p water is estimated to be at negative pressure by tanaka  @xcite , while it is found at positive pressures for st2  @xcite tip5p  @xcite and tip4p - ew  @xcite . from the behaviour of our iscohores , tmd and spinodal for both the bulk water and the aqueous solution",
    "it is actually not easy to establish whether it falls at positive or negative pressures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the tmd line of nacl(aq ) and bulk water are reported together with the spinodal lines of the two systems . comparing the tmd lines we notice that , apart for the mild temperature shift due to the colligative properties of the solutions , the tmd lines appear different in shape . in fact , spanning the same range of densities",
    ", the nacl(aq ) tmd extends in a region of pressures wider than that of the bulk .",
    "therefore , the effect of the ions upon supercooling is not limited to give a rigid translation of the phase diagram .",
    "while the presence of the ions seems to induce important changes in an anomalous thermodynamic property of water , the tmd , the limit of mechanical stability appears not affected by the ions .",
    "in fact from fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] we can see that the spinodal lines of the two systems are almost indistinguishable from each other .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] we present the configurational ( or potential ) energy ( per molecule ) of the nacl(aq ) and bulk systems , at @xmath32  k , as a function of density . in the nacl(aq ) u presents a minimum in correspondence of @xmath39 while in the bulk the minimum is reached for @xmath40 .",
    "these energy extrema can be related to the existence of ldl and hdl phases .",
    "it has been shown by kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that two minima are present for tip5p water confined between hydrophobic plates for @xmath41 and for @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of this minimum in our system supports the existence of a liquid - liquid ( ll ) coexistence also in the aqueous solution .",
    "we discuss in this section the radial distribution functions ( rdfs ) of the aqueous solution , @xmath43 , computed averaging the equilibrated configurations .    in the nacl(aq ) system at the salt content",
    "investigated we do not observe significant changes in water - water rdfs with respect to the bulk system .",
    "minor differences occur only in the secondary peaks , for low densities and in the deep supercooled region ( not shown ) .",
    "it has been shown in a number of papers  @xcite that the effect of the ions on water - water structure is similar to the one obtained applying an external pressure and that it becomes more evident upon increasing the salt content .",
    "the salt concentration in our system , @xmath2 , is probably too low to find clear evidence of this effect . besides both sodium and chloride ions can be found in the central region of the hofmeister series so that not very marked effect on water - water structure are expected .",
    "we present in the following the analysis of the water - ion structure comparing rdfs along the isotherms @xmath14  k and @xmath32  k for densities from @xmath13 to @xmath12 .",
    "we note that for the highest density at @xmath14  k the rdfs show different trends with respect to all other densities investigated .",
    "these trends likely anticipate a different behaviour of the system at very high densities ( not investigated in the present paper ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] we show the sodium - oxygen and the sodium - hydrogen rdfs .",
    "we observe that for both temperatures the first and the second coordination shells of the @xmath44 are well defined showing the tendency of water to form stable hydration shells around the sodium ion , usually classified as a structure - making . for the @xmath45 the first shell",
    "is also well defined while the second shell is broader .",
    "the position of the first peak of the @xmath45 is shifted to a higher distance with respect to the position of the first peak of the @xmath44 .",
    "the difference between the two peaks is circa @xmath46 indicating that the two hydrogens of the molecule lie symmetrically around the sodium ion .",
    "this result is confirmed by the coordination numbers of the first shell which we report in fig .",
    "[ fig:10bis ] together with the coordination numbers of the cl  o and cl  h .",
    "we consider now more in detail the behaviour of the @xmath44 as function of the density .    at @xmath14",
    "k starting from @xmath47 the peaks heights decrease significantly until they reach a minimum at the density of the spinodal line , @xmath20 . for densities lower than this value down to @xmath12",
    "the peaks heights slightly increase again . on going from high density down to the spinodal density along the isotherm",
    "the @xmath3 ions partially lose their structure - making ability due to the approach to the instability region , where the onset of large fluctuations and a tendency to demixing could appear .    at @xmath32",
    "k the two peaks slightly sharpen as a consequence of decreasing temperature . starting from @xmath47",
    "the height of the first peak of the @xmath44 now shows a maximum in proximity of the energy minimum density , then it decreases showing a minimum on approaching the spinodal density .",
    "we observe close to the second peak the appearance of secondary shells especially for densities close to the spinodal and to the energy minimum density , e.g. a possible region of ll coexistence .",
    "this indicates that the second shell of hydration is less defined .",
    "the @xmath45 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] displays an analogous trend as a function of density both for @xmath14  k and @xmath32  k with respect to that observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] for the sodium - oxygen pair .",
    "in particular we observe also here the appearance of secondary shells .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] we show the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 .    for the @xmath48",
    "we see a broad and structured first shell and a not well defined second shell . for the @xmath49",
    "we observe a well defined first peak and a broad and structured second shell . at variance with the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 the first and the second shell",
    "are not always well defined for these rdfs because of the structure breaking property of the @xmath4 ion .    by comparing the positions of the first peaks of the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 we note an approximated charge ordering around the negative chloride ion .",
    "the partially positive charged hydrogens move closer to the ions and the first shell of the oxygens is placed around the first minimum of the @xmath49 .",
    "we now analyse the behaviour of the @xmath4 rdfs as a function of densities for the two temperatures investigated .    for the @xmath48 at @xmath14  k the first shell of oxygens",
    "is well defined only at @xmath47 .",
    "below @xmath47 a shoulder appears on the right side of the first peak .",
    "the peaks heights of the @xmath48 show a trend similar to that of the @xmath44 while their shape is more strongly dependent on the density . on approaching the spinodal the first peak merges with the shoulder resulting in a broad structure .",
    "the structure - breaking role of the @xmath4 ions seems to be reinforced close to the instability limit .    at @xmath32",
    "k the shoulder close to the first peak evolves in a second peak indicating a less stable configuration of the chloride hydration with respect to sodium .",
    "in fact the first hydration shell is characterized by the existence of two possible equilibrium positions albeit close to each other for the chloride - oxygen pair . in this",
    "first shell oxygens of two kinds are present , those tied to the hydrogens of the first shell of the @xmath50 and those tied to hydrogens belonging to the second shell of the @xmath50 that in fact also shows double peak structure ( see fig.[fig:12 ] ) . for this temperature",
    "a structuring of the curves also appears for densities close to the energy minimum density and to the spinodal density .    for the @xmath49 , fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] , the trend of the peaks intensities as a function of density are similar to those in fig .  [ fig:11 ] but the rdfs appear much more structured with a second and third shell evident at all densities .",
    "the second shell is modulated in a double peak structure for both temperatures .",
    "we also note that for both temperatures the first shell of hydrogens of the @xmath49 is well defined at all densities , at variance with the second peak .",
    "it shows that hydrogens penetrate inside the shell of the oxygens for the attraction of the ions .",
    "the broadening and the modulation of the oxygen first peaks and the hydrogen second peaks in the the @xmath48 and the @xmath49 respectively seem to be related to a competition between the formation of the hydrogen bonds and the repulsion / attraction of the chloride ion with respect to oxygen / hydrogen atoms .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath3 ions are able to form a sufficiently rigid shell of oxygens , see the first peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , breaking the hydrogen bonds when necessary while the @xmath4 ions can attract the hydrogens in a first shell and repel the oxygens , but they have little effect on the hydrogen bonding .",
    "coordination numbers confirm this picture , see fig .",
    "[ fig:10bis ] .",
    "they show in fact no correlation in trend between the first shell of hydrogen and the first shell of oxygens around the chloride ion as a function of density .    for each of the four hydration rdfs the peaks positions are compatible with what found in literature .",
    "@xcite    the ion - ion rdfs ( not shown ) have a low statistic due to the low concentration .",
    "the positions of the peaks indicate the presence of clusters of positive and negative ions in agreement with what reported in several papers ,  @xcite both theoretical and experimental .",
    "we performed molecular dynamics simulations of a sodium chloride aqueous solution with concentration @xmath2 and of bulk water upon supercooling at different densities .",
    "we used tip4p water model both for the aqueous solution and for the bulk .",
    "we studied how the thermodynamic behaviour of bulk water is modified by the presence of ions and in particular the possible modification of the tmd and of the spinodal line .",
    "we found that while the presence of ions influences the shape and the position of the tmd , it leaves substantially unaltered the spinodal line with respect to the bulk .",
    "besides the tmd curve appears broadened and it extends to much lower temperatures than bulk tmd . in a previous study of tip4p water under hydrophobic confinement  @xcite it was found that both the spinodal line and the tmd are shifted toward higher pressures . in the case of the aqueous solution",
    "studied in the present work the tmd line shifts also to lower temperatures and correspondingly its curvature broadens .",
    "in addition , the presence of the ions moves the isotherms and the isochores toward lower pressures and it slightly modifies their shape , especially in proximity to the minima of those curves .",
    "therefore , although the limit of mechanical stability of the system remains unaltered in the solution , the effect of ions is not limited to a trivial pressure shift .",
    "the modification of the isotherms and the isochores curves and especially of the tmd shows that in the supercooled regime the ions affect the thermodynamics of the system even at this low concentration .    in our aqueous solution we observed at higher densities a crossing of the two lowest temperatures isotherms with the higher temperatures ones .",
    "it has been shown that the change of sign of the curvature of isotherms in this density region is connected to the existence of a second critical point in bulk water .",
    "@xcite we can consequently hypothesize the existence of a ll critical point also in the solution probably shifted to higher densities .",
    "the tmd shape is related to the position of the ll critical point hence our results indicate that the presence of ions stabilizes the high density liquid phase driving down in temperature the ll line .",
    "interestingly two recent experimental papers by o. mishima  @xcite on licl - water solutions seem to indicate a suppression of the transition to the low density amorphous - like ( lda - like ) water .",
    "this appears consistent with our tmd line shift . besides , according to j. holzmann et al .",
    "the shift to low temperatures of the tmd can be framed in a picture in which the free water , that is the water far from ions , becomes upon supercooling more mobile and pressurized .",
    "@xcite    the spinodal line , related to low density liquid properties , does not show any substantial modification with respect to the bulk at least when a small amount of ions is present .",
    "the shape of the curve describing the configurational energy as a function of the density ( see fig . [ fig:8 ] ) for the nacl(aq ) closely resembles what found by kumar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for confined water in the low density region zone explored in this work .",
    "importantly we observe the presence of a minimum analogous to the ll low density coexistence minimum observed in bulk water .",
    "the structural analysis of the nacl(aq ) , shown here for @xmath14  k and at @xmath32  k , revealed that the four hydration radial distribution functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 display minima in peaks intensities in proximity to the density corresponding to the spinodal line at both high and low temperatures and the appearance of several secondary peaks for densities close to the spinodal line and to the configurational energy minimum , at low temperatures .",
    "therefore we found that the spinodal line and the energy minimum , low density ll coexistence , affect significantly the hydration structure .    as regards structure - making / breaking effects , the traditional classification of @xmath3 ion as structure - making and @xmath4 ion as structure - breaking  @xcite appears confirmed in this work .",
    "sodium ions in fact tend to break water hydrogen bonds favouring a rearrangement of the equilibrium positions of the molecules around the ion that results in the formation of definite hydration shells ( especially the first one ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the chloride having a greater ionic radius and thus a minor charge density , is less effective in breaking the hydrogen bonds .",
    "therefore its coordination shells are less defined and more disordered as also indicated by the presence of secondary peaks in the shell structures .",
    "we have seen that all peaks intensities of our hydration rdfs follow a similar pattern as a function of the density .",
    "the presence of minima in the peaks heights is probably connected to the approach of the system to the spinodal line .",
    "on going from high density toward the spinodal density @xmath3 ions partially loose their structure making ability while the structure breaking properties of the @xmath4 ions seems to be reinforced .",
    "several extensions of this study can be proposed .",
    "in particular the analysis of higher densities and concentrations would be of the uttermost interest in order to investigate how thermodynamic and structural properties change varying those variables . indeed varying either the concentration or the chemical species of the solutes",
    "provides a tool to prepare a system with suitable properties , for example for cryopreservation .",
