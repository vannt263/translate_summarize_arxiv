    "are taken as random independent variables ( subject to the conditions on @xmath23 ) with gaussian distributions such that @xmath28 and @xmath29=@xmath30 ( similarly for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the function @xmath31 is a spectral density .",
    "it can be shown that a random field defined in this manner has field - field correlation function @xmath32 by convention @xmath33 which sets a constant of proportionality on @xmath31 .",
    "the definition  ( [ yf ] ) can be efficiently evaluated by an fft routine  @xcite and is @xmath11-periodic in each direction .",
    "this is valuable for approximating an infinite medium in calculations of macroscopic properties .",

    "the phase function is @xmath73 so that @xmath74 and @xmath75 therefore if the statistical properties of the original morphologies are known ( eg",
    ".  level - cut grf s or the overlapping sphere model ) the properties of their union and intersection sets are also known  @xcite .",

    "these simple results greatly extend the classes of morphology which can be reproduced by the models .    to simplify matters we now restrict attention to a few primary models of microstructure .",

    "the reconstruction shares first and second order statistical properties with the image and would therefore be expected to yield a reasonable model of the original composite .",
    "this is similar to the procedure of quiblier  @xcite employed in previous studies  @xcite although the formulation of the model is different .",
    "there are several operational problems with this reconstruction procedure .",

    "( [ invone ] ) may yield a spectral density @xmath31 which is not strictly positive .",

    "n , i and u of   [ newmodels ] and show how these problems can be avoided .",
    "first select one of the three models ( n , i or u ) and a value of @xmath118=@xmath22 , @xmath119 or @xmath120 ( giving a total of nine combinations ) so that @xmath121 and @xmath114 are fixed by @xmath110 .",
    "it remains to find @xmath102 . instead of inverting an analog of eq .",
    "( [ invone ] ) we assume this function is of the general form given by eq .",
    "( [ modelg ] ) ( this guarantees that @xmath31 is positive ) .",
    "the three length scale parameters are obtained by a best fit procedure which minimises the normalised least - squares error ; @xmath122 ^ 2 / \\sum_{i=1}^{m } [ p^{(2)}_{exp}(r_i)-p_{exp}^2]^2 . \\label{ep2}\\ ] ] here @xmath123 $ ] is the correlation function appropriate for model n , i or u. once @xmath100 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 have been obtained the reconstruction @xmath1 can be generated .",
    "if the one - cut model ( n , @xmath112 ) is chosen we assume that the results will not differ significantly from those obtained using quiblier s method .    to illustrate the procedure we reconstruct a material with known statistical properties .",

    ", @xmath134 denotes @xmath135 .",
    "[ tabiia ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this does not alter our conclusions as all the data presented at a given volume fraction are presumably effected in the same manner .",
    "the data of bentz and martys  @xcite ( bm ) for the ios model and their one - cut reconstruction are consistently lower than ours .",
    "we have developed a method of reconstructing three - dimensional two - phase composite materials from information which can be obtained from digitised micrographs .",
    "first a range of models are generated which share low order ( volume fraction and two - point correlation function ) statistical properties with the experimental sample .",
    "the model which most closely reproduces the chord - distributions of the experimental material is chosen .",
    "the distribution functions provided a better signature of microstructure than the three - point correlation function and are simpler to measure than the microstructure parameters @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "significantly the three - point and higher order correlation functions of the reconstructions can be calculated and employed in rigourous analytical microstructure - property relationships .",
    "we found that materials with practically identical two point correlation functions can have very different morphologies and macroscopic properties .",
    "this demonstrates that reconstructions based on this information alone  @xcite do not necessarily provide a useful model of the original material . if the correlation function exhibits strong oscillations we found evidence that prior methods will provide satisfactory reconstructions . in this case",
    "it is important to compare the chord - distributions of the model and experimental materials .",
    "our method can be applied to a wider range of composite and porous media than prior reconstruction techniques .",
    "the generality of the method is achieved by incorporating new models based on the intersection and union sets of level - cut grf models .",
    "the former have recently been shown to be applicable to organic aerogels  @xcite and porous sandstones  @xcite , while the latter may be useful for modelling closed - cell foams .",
    "techniques based on the single - cut grf model can not reproduce the low percolation thresholds of these materials  @xcite .",
    "the method was successfully used to reconstruct several test composites and the overlapping sphere model over a range of volume fractions .",
    "the reconstructions are better able to model the morphology and transport properties of the ios model than prior studies  @xcite .",
    "there are several problems with the reconstruction procedure .",
    "first , it is possible that two materials with different properties may share first and second order statistical information and chord - distribution functions . in this case",
    "the reconstruction method could fail to yield good estimates of the macroscopic properties .",
    "second , the generality of the models we have employed is not sufficient to mimic all real composites ( although prior studies have shown them to be appropriate for a wide range of materials  @xcite ) .",
    "an example is provided above where our nine basic reconstructions were unable to model the chord - distribution of the ios model . in this case",
    "a further generalisation was found to be successful .",
    "others are possible .",
    "for example , the restriction that the level - cut and length scales parameters are identical for each component of the intersection and union sets can be relaxed , or overlapping spheres can be incorporated in the level - cut scheme . however the problem remains .",
    "it is unlikely , for example , that the morphology of randomly packed hard spheres could be mimicked by this scheme .",
    "third , models formed from the union and intersection sets contain sharp edges which are energetically unfavourable in many materials .",
    "however there is little evidence that these play a strong role in determining macroscopic properties .",
    "new techniques of characterising microstructure are currently being developed such as those based on information - entropy  @xcite .",
    "these may contribute to the problem of selecting the best reconstructions .",
    "our work also has application to the inverse - problem of small - angle x - ray scattering from amorphous materials . in this case",
    "the problem is made more difficult by the absence of higher - order information such as chord - distributions ( although some progress may be possible  @xcite ) .",
    "work is underway to model anisotropic composites and apply the method to experimental systems .",
    "the fact that @xmath138 contains high - order statistical information ( in the sense suggested by the hierarchy of correlation functions ) is demonstrated by the following argument .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the so called lineal - path function  @xcite .",
    "this function expresses the probability that a line of length @xmath5 placed randomly in the material will lie entirely with in phase one .",
    "this quantity is approximately equal to the probability that @xmath43 points along a line lie in phase one , ie .",
    "it can be obtained from the @xmath43-point function . as the distance between the points shrinks ( ie .",
    "@xmath141 ) equality is established .    in part",
    "this can be understood in terms of the close relationship between the functions ( e.g. @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "however the fact that @xmath137 and @xmath136 can vary significantly between composites with similar @xmath144 ( e.g.  table  [ tabiib ] ) indicates that this function contains distinguishing features of the microstructure : these are just not seen by the measure @xmath145 ."
