    "the behavior of gold nanojunctions have been widely investigated in the past years . due to its inertness , gold is an easy - to - use material , and au nanojunctions can even be studied under ambient conditions with a low risk for contamination .",
    "this monovalent metal was found to be a perfect candidate for studying the quantum nature of conductance in a single - atom contact .",
    "it was shown by various experimental and theoretical methods that a monoatomic au junction has a single conductance channel with perfect transmission.@xcite surprising was the discovery that au has a special property of forming monoatomic chains during the elongation of a single - atom contact.@xcite    recently , another remarkable property of gold was proposed : various theoretical simulations have pointed out that - contrary to the well - known inertness of macroscopic au surfaces - _ gold nanostructures _ are strongly reactive constructions of nature.@xcite this proposal is supported by experimental studies on the catalytic properties of au nanoclusters.@xcite the possibility for the chemical interaction of gold nanowires with adsorbants was initially advised in order to explain the anomalously large inter - gold distances in electron microscope images of au nanochains.@xcite in this paper we present an experimental study on the chemical interaction of gold nanochains with the simplest molecule , h@xmath0 .",
    "we compare our results to recent theoretical calculations investigating the possible configurations , where hydrogen is chemically bound to the au nanowire.@xcite     region .",
    "this peak arises due to flat conductance plateaus at @xmath1 corresponding to single atom au contacts or monoatomic au wires ( the latter is shown in the inset , an interatomic au - au distance in the chain is @xmath2 ) .",
    "the area graph in panel ( b ) is the histogram of gold in hydrogen environment , showing the appearance of new atomic configurations in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "the inset shows an example for a trace with a well - structured periodic behavior in the low - conductance region , which is attributed to the pulling of a gold chain with an incorporated h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "the line graph in panel ( b ) is the histogram for the hydrogen affected traces ( see text ) . _ _ ]    our measurements were performed on high - purity gold samples with the mechanically controllable break junction ( mcbj ) technique under cryogenic circumstances .",
    "we have investigated the characteristic behavior of the nanocontacts by acquiring a large number of conductance traces during the repeated separation of the electrodes , and collecting the data into conductance histograms.@xcite a typical conductance histogram measured in ultra high vacuum is presented in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig]a .",
    "the most pronounced feature is a sharp peak at the quantum conductance unit , g@xmath4 .",
    "this peak arises due to flat conductance plateaus at @xmath1 corresponding to single atom au contacts or monoatomic au wires ( see inset ) both having a single conductance channel with almost perfect transmission.@xcite the lower edge of the histogram shows that nanocontacts with lower conductance can also occur down to @xmath5g@xmath6 , but below that value the histogram has no counts . in hydrogen environment",
    ", however , a low - conductance tail arises in the histogram [ area graph in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig]b ] , that is the conductance of the nanojunctions can take any value below the quantum unit .",
    "the growth of the tail in the histogram is attributed to the appearance of new , low - conductance atomic arrangements in the hydrogen environment .",
    "usually a peak near @xmath7g@xmath6 is also superpositioned on the low - conductance tail with varying amplitude , which was in the focus of our previous work.@xcite the object of this study is to understand the microscopic nature of the new hydrogen - related atomic configurations through the statistical analysis of the conductance traces .",
    "the emphasis is put on the whole low - conductance tail , and the results are insensitive to the weight of the peak at @xmath7g@xmath6 .",
    "first we show with the investigation of plateau s length histograms that gold nanocontacts in hydrogen environment are generally exhibiting the formation of atomic gold chains , however , the interaction with hydrogen can strongly reduce the transmission of the chain .",
    "next , we demonstrate a unique feature , which is observed on a portion of the conductance traces showing a well - structured periodic behavior .",
    "an example for such traces is already presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig]b .",
    "based on recent theoretical simulations we attribute this phenomenon to the pulling of gold nanowires with an incorporated hydrogen molecule .",
    "our measurements are in close relation to recent studies on the interaction of hydrogen molecules with platinum and palladium nanocontacts.@xcite in both cases the histogram in high vacuum shows a pronounced peak at @xmath8 , which is attributed to the conductance of single atom pt and pd contacts . the interaction with hydrogen ,",
    "however , completely suppresses this peak , and new , hydrogen - related peaks grow . in the case of platinum the vibrational modes detected by nonlinear @xmath9 characteristics gave clear evidence that a molecular hydrogen bridge is formed between the platinum electrodes , which has perfect transmission through a single conductance channel . in palladium",
    "the transmission is reduced due to the dissolution of h atoms in the pd electrodes .    in gold the novel phenomena due to the interaction with hydrogen",
    "is reflected by the growth of the low - conductance tail in the histogram , but the presence of hydrogen does not destroy the sharp peak at the quantum unit , which is attributed to single atom au contacts or monoatomic au chains .",
    "it implies that in gold the interaction with hydrogen can coexist with the characteristic behavior of pure gold junctions .",
    "as it was presented in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig ] , hydrogen induces new low - conductance configurations .",
    "further on it will be demonstrated by the statistical analysis of the conductance traces that the observed new configurations are also related to atomic gold chains .    to make a quantitative analysis possible ,",
    "we define two conductance regions , as shown by the shadowed areas in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig ] .",
    "the first region ( `` @xmath1 region '' ) is identified with the interval where the peak at @xmath10 grows in the conductance histogram of pure gold , @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the second , so - called `` low-@xmath3 '' region is the interval , where the new hydrogen - related configurations arise in the histogram , @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "we found that even in hydrogen surrounding a lot of traces show the behavior of pure gold , exhibiting plateaus near @xmath13g@xmath6 without any data points in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "the histogram for these curves completely resembles the one taken in the absence of hydrogen .",
    "next we investigate the other portion of the traces that do show low-@xmath3 configurations . we shall call a trace `` hydrogen - affected '' if it stays for a reasonable length of @xmath14  in the low-@xmath3 region .    with these definitions we find that typically @xmath15 of the traces is hydrogen - affected .",
    "the histogram for this portion of the traces is plotted by the line graph in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig]b .",
    "this histogram can be directly compared to the one for the whole data set ( area graph ) , as both of them are normalized to the number of traces included . naturally , for the hydrogen - affected curves the weight in the low-@xmath3 region is significantly larger .",
    "at @xmath16 the two histograms precisely fall onto each other , whereas the peak near the conductance quantum is significantly suppressed for the hydrogen - affected traces .",
    "it implies , that the appearance of the new low-@xmath3 configurations does not affect the evolution of the conductance of larger junctions , but it strongly influences the behavior of single atom contacts or atomic chains . a deeper insight into this correlation can be obtained by investigating the distribution of the lengths of the traces in the above defined two regions .       of all curves ) .",
    "the line graph shows the distribution of the lengths in the @xmath1 region , the dashed line shows the distribution of the lengths in the low-@xmath3 region , whereas the area graph presents the distribution of the summed lengths of the low-@xmath3 and @xmath1 regions . _ _ ]    figure  [ platlength.fig]a presents the distribution of the lengths in the @xmath1 region for those traces that are not affected by the hydrogen .",
    "this so - called plateaus length histogram shows an equidistant peak structure , which is the proof for the formation of chains of gold atoms , as it was shown by yanson et al.@xcite the peaks in this histogram correspond to the rupture of chains with different number of gold atoms included , and the distance between the peaks corresponds to the interatomic au - au distance in the chain .",
    "this plateaus length histogram is identical to the one taken before admitting hydrogen to the junction , thus it can be regarded as a reference histogram showing the formation of pure gold atomic chains .",
    "the peaks in this histogram are also used to calibrate the length scale , as in a pure gold atomic chain the interatomic distance was measured to be @xmath2.@xcite    next we investigate how this chain formation is influenced by the interaction with hydrogen . in the case of pure gold",
    "the conductance of the last atomic configuration before the breakage always shows a flat plateau in the close vicinity of @xmath1 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ corrhist.fig]a ) , and accordingly the plateaus length histogram is built from the distribution of the lengths in the @xmath1 region . in the case of the `` hydrogen - affected '' curves , however , the conductance can take any value below the quantum unit , thus it makes sense to study the distribution of the lengths both in the @xmath1 and in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "the determination of these lengths is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ lengthmeas.fig ] .     and low-@xmath3 region , i.e. @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "_ _ ]    the proper analysis of the distribution of the plateau s length gives distinctive information about the possible microscopic choreographies of the rupture .",
    "for instance a strong interaction with hydrogen might completely destroy the chain formation , which would result in the disappearance of the equidistant peak structure in the plateau s length histogram , and only the first peak would survive . as another possibility , one can consider that perfectly transmitting chains are formed just like in pure environment , and the new low - conductance configurations are only appearing after the rupture of these chains . in this case",
    "the distribution of the plateau s length in the @xmath1 region should show the same equidistant peak structure as the reference histogram in fig .",
    "[ platlength.fig]a .",
    "in contrast , the measurement shows that for the hydrogen affected traces the plateau s length histogram for the @xmath1 region is strongly distorted compared to the reference histogram ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ platlength.fig]b ) .",
    "a plateau s length histogram can also be plotted for the low-@xmath3 configurations , exhibiting a completely featureless distribution ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ platlength.fig]b ) .",
    "surprisingly , the distribution of the _ summed length _ of the low-@xmath3 and @xmath1 region [ area graph in fig .  [ platlength.fig]b ] shows the well - defined peak structure just like the reference histogram [ fig .",
    "[ platlength.fig]a ] .",
    "( for the definition of the summed length see fig .",
    "[ lengthmeas.fig ] . )",
    "observing peaks at the same equidistant positions as in the case of pure gold demonstrates that the chain formation is preserved in hydrogen environment .",
    "but contrary to pure gold , the peaks appear in the plateaus length histogram of the entire 1g@xmath6 and low - g region which also has an important consequence that the new low - conductance configurations are not arising _ after _ the rupture of the chain , but both the @xmath1 and the low-@xmath3 configurations are a part of the chain formation .",
    "this can be explained as follows : an atomic gold chain is formed just like in pure environment , but during this process at a certain point the hydrogen binds to the chain , which results in the strong reduction of the transmission .",
    "an individual trace corresponding to this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ lengthmeas.fig ] .",
    "it is noted that the interaction with h@xmath0 strongly reduces the conductance of the chain , but the atomic periodicity agrees with that of pure au chains .     and @xmath1 regions .",
    "the dashed line shows the calculated distribution of the summed length which means the convolution of the plateaus length histograms for the low - g region and 1g@xmath6 region assuming that the lengths in these two regions are independent .",
    "the appearance of the peaks demonstrates the correlations indicating the chain formation in the entire low-@xmath3 and @xmath1 regions .",
    "_ _ ]    as the length of the entire 1g@xmath6 and low - g regions follows a well - defined , periodic distribution , the lengths in its two subregions must be correlated .",
    "this correlation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ convolution.fig ] . if the length of the configurations in the low - g and 1g@xmath6 region were independent , the distribution of the summed length could be expressed simply as the convolution of the distribution functions of the two subregions , which is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the calculated convolution curve assuming the independence of the subregions only gives the rough tendency of the measured one ( area graph ) , but it can not explain the presence of the peaks .",
    "it nicely demonstrates again that the low - g region and 1g@xmath6 region must be considered together and the entire @xmath18 $ ] is the physically relevant conductance region for the chain formation process in hydrogen environment .",
    "$ ] region before break , whereas the returning length is the length measured from point of breakage back to point , where a contact with @xmath19g@xmath6 is reestablished .",
    "_ _ ]    further confirmation for the chain formation process for the hydrogen affected curves can be obtained by the statistical analysis of the returning lengths following the idea of yanson et al.@xcite if an atomic chain is being broken the atoms in the chain collapse back to the electrodes , thus in order to reestablish the contact the electrodes must be pushed towards each other by almost the same distance as the length of the chain was .",
    "this means that the relation between the length of the plateau before the break and the so - called returning length is approximately 1:1 .",
    "[ returnlength.fig ] shows that this relation holds not only for the traces that are non - affected by the hydrogen but also for the hydrogen affected curves .",
    "the bottom curve is on true scale , while the other curves are artificially shifted on the conductance axis for the sake of visibility ( the corresponding zeros are signed on the right axis ) .",
    "the interatomic distance in the pure gold chain is indicated by grid lines .",
    "approximately @xmath20 of the traces shows this special behavior . _",
    "_ ]     in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "the averaging was done as a function of the length measured backward from the point of breakage . _ _ ]    in previous studies solely the analysis of the distribution of the plateaus length was applied to demonstrate the chain formation process and to determine the atomic periodicity of the chains , as generally the chain formation is not visible on the shape of individual conductance traces . in hydrogen environment , however , we have found that a part of the traces ( @xmath21 of all curves ) exhibit a well structured periodic behavior in the low-@xmath3 region , as demonstrated by the curves in fig .",
    "[ longcurves.fig ] .",
    "these traces show periods with positive slope , where the conductance is significantly increasing as the electrodes are pulled apart . at the end of these periods",
    "the conductance frequently jumps to the initial value , and the same behavior is repeated several times .",
    "generally the conductance of these periodic sections is situated in the bottom of the low - g region , that is in the interval @xmath22 $ ] ( which will be called as `` tail region '' ) .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude of these oscillations can be as large as @xmath23 , which frequently exceeds the mean value of the conductance .",
    "the grid lines of the figure are drawn with a separation corresponding to the interatomic distance of the pure gold chains , @xmath24 .",
    "it is apparent that the length of these periods is close to the interatomic gold - gold distance in a monoatomic chain , which implies that these special conductance traces are also related to the chain formation .    to check the statistical relevance of the behavior demonstrated by the curves in fig",
    "[ longcurves.fig ] , we have calculated an average conductance curve [ fig .  [ avrcurve.fig ] ] . in order to determine the average behavior along several interatomic distances ,",
    "we have restricted the averaging for those traces that stay for a length of @xmath25  in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "the average conductance curve also shows the oscillatory behavior with a period coinciding with the interatomic gold - gold distance , showing that the well structured periodic behavior of the traces in the low-@xmath3 region is a substantial feature of gold nanojunctions breaking in hydrogen environment .",
    "we attribute this behavior to a unique type of contact breakage , corresponding to a special microscopic process , which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] .      the plateaus length analysis discussed in sec .",
    "[ plhanal ] has shown that gold nanocontacts in hydrogen environment are generally showing the formation of atomic gold chains , however the interaction with hydrogen can strongly reduce the transmission of the chain . in sections  [ newclass ]",
    "[ longcurves.fig ] and [ avrcurve.fig ] demonstrated a well - structured periodic behavior , which is observed only on a portion of the traces , and which is also related to some kind of chain formation process . in the latter case",
    "the chain formation is not just statistically detectable , but it is seen on the shape of the individual conductance curves . in the following part it will be analyzed how these two phenomena are related to each other .",
    "it is to be emphasized that not only the periodicity but also the pronounced positive slope is an interesting peculiar property of the conductance curves presented in fig .  [ longcurves.fig ] .",
    "the positive slope of a conductance trace means that the transmission of a certain atomic configuration is increasing despite of the fact that the electrodes are pulled apart and so the average distance between the atoms is increasing .",
    "such an unusual behavior is not observed in pure gold junctions .",
    "surveying the individual conductance traces in hydrogen surrounding one by one we found that practically only the curves presenting the well - defined periodic structure exhibit positive slope . therefore , this is a distinctive feature , which can be used to statistically separate the special periodic traces from the rest of the hydrogen affected curves .",
    "we found that the periodic traces can be selected with good certainty by sorting out those curves , for which the length of the parts with positive slope in the low - g region is larger than @xmath26 of the the whole length in the low - g region .",

    "[ platlength.fig ] : an atomic chain formation process taking place in the entire conductance region of @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "contrary , the traces with well - structured periodic behavior do not show this feature , the plateaus length histogram for these curves is completely featureless .    as the special periodic behavior basically appears in the tail region , it is interesting to plot the plateaus length histograms for the tail region as well ( fig .",
    "[ platlength2.fig]b ) . in this case",
    "the distribution of the lengths for the periodic traces shows equidistant peaks separated by a distance of 2.5  whereas the distribution of the lengths for the rest of the curves is completely featureless .",
    "this analysis shows that two different types of hydrogen related chain formation processes can be distinguished .",
    "the first one is seen for the majority of the hydrogen affected traces , during the pulling of a chain at a random point the conductance switches from the 1g@xmath6 value to the low-@xmath3 region , but the entire length remains the same as in pure gold .",
    "this is demonstrated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ platlength2.fig]a .",
    "the second one is only observed for a portion of the traces ( @xmath29 ) , the conductance of the chain drops to the tail region where a well - structured periodic behavior is visible on every subsequent gold - gold interatomic distance ( see the dashed curve in fig .  [ platlength2.fig ] ) . in the next part",
    "the possible microscopic background for these two processes is discussed .",
    "further steps towards the microscopic understanding of the observed phenomena can be done by comparing our experimental results with recent computer simulations on the interaction of hydrogen molecules with gold nanocontacts .",
    "barnett et al .",
    "have found that the basically inert gold surface becomes highly reactive with hydrogen at nanoscale due to the relativistic corrections in the electronic structure.@xcite various atomic configurations were studied , including a hydrogen molecule weakly bound to the side of a gold chain , a h@xmath0 molecule incorporated in the gold chain , and dissociated h atoms sitting in the chain .",
    "this study has shown that a h@xmath0 molecule incorporated in the gold chain is a robust configuration with high binding energy , which can be reached without any barrier .",
    "all these configurations have conductances in the range of @xmath30 , which coincides with the interval , where the strongest weight is observed in the low - g region of the hydrogen - affected conductance histogram [ fig .  [ corrhist.fig]b ] .",
    "the configuration where the hydrogen molecule is weakly bound to the side of the chain ( see fig .  [",

    "[ plhanal ] , fig .",
    "[ platlength.fig ] ] .",
    "the formation of atomic gold chains is preserved , but the chain gets distorted due to the binding of the h@xmath0 molecule and thus its transmission is reduced .    on the other hand",

    "[ newclass ] , fig .",
    "[ longcurves.fig ] ] .",
    "the simulations have shown that the molecule can be oriented in different angles with respect to the contact axis .",
    "the perpendicular configuration has a smaller conductance of @xmath31 , but as the electrodes are pulled apart and the molecule turns towards the parallel configuration the conductance grows up to @xmath32 . during this process",
    "the force acting between the molecule and the gold nanojunction reaches values as high as @xmath33nn , and before the complete rupture it can even grow to @xmath34nn.@xcite note that these forces are in the same range as the ones required for pulling monoatomic gold chains ( @xmath35nn).@xcite    based on these considerations we give an explicit proposal for the well - defined periodic behavior of the conductance traces demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ longcurves.fig ] .",
    "we suggest that as a gold nanojunction is pulled apart , a hydrogen molecule gets incorporated in the chain . during further retraction of the electrodes this hydrogen clamp does not break , but it is strong enough to pull further gold atoms into the chain . once a new gold atom jumps into the chain the molecule gets in a tilted position with smaller conductance , but as the contact is pulled the molecule straightens out and thus the conductance increases until the point where the next atom jumps into the chain .",
    "an illustration of this process is shown in fig .",
    "[ h2clamp.fig]b .",
    "we have also performed @xmath9 curve measurements in order to determine the vibrational energies of the molecule in the chain similarly to ref .  .",
    "we have found , that in the low-@xmath3 range the nonlinearity due to quantum interference phenomena @xcite is so high that the vibrational spectrum could not be resolved .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that hydrogen molecules can strongly interact with gold nanojunctions , which is reflected by the appearance of new , low - conductance atomic configurations . by the analysis of plateaus length histograms we have demonstrated that these low-@xmath3 configurations are not established _ after _ the formation of monoatomic gold chains , but they are a natural part of the chain formation process .",
    "in addition we have shown , that the conductance traces frequently show a well - defined periodic behavior with positive slope in the low-@xmath3 region .",
    "this observation is suggestive for a specific chain formation process : a hydrogen molecule gets incorporated in the gold nanojunction , and this hydrogen clamp is strong enough to pull a monoatomic gold chain from the electrodes ."
