    "experiments on dispersions of superheated superconducting granules ( ssg ) have investigated the feasibility of these systems as detectors of neutrinos , dark matter and other particles @xcite . in these devices",

    "if a particle or radiation with enough energy collides with a microgranule it can produce a transition to the normal conducting state .",
    "the disappearance of the meissner effect , inherent to the transition , produces a change in the magnetic flux that can be detected by a magnetometer .    despite their promising applications , some intrinsic features of ssg limit the efficiency of these detectors .",
    "the metastability of each grain of the suspension depends on its shape and surface quality and on the diamagnetic interactions with the other microgranules .",
    "dispersion in size combined with these effects produces a spread of transition fields of about @xmath0 , which affects the accuracy of these devices .",
    "planar systems of microgranules arrayed in a regular configuration ( pass ) have been presented as an alternative to ssg to reduce this spread @xcite .",
    "the present manufacturing techniques of pass devices can only produce arrays of a relatively small size , but with good sensitivity in both energy and position .",
    "the regular arrangement allows the control of magnetic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the photolithographic procedure employed in their manufacture enables microgranules with excellent uniformity in shape and size to be obtained .",
    "although these characteristics do not completely eliminate the dispersion of superheated transition field values , reductions of an order of magnitude have been observed @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 on the other hand , the regular spatial configuration and the greater uniformity in shape and size of these systems suggest the possibility of the presence of avalanches that could amplify the magnetic signal .",
    "avalanches are a consequence of diamagnetic interactions between grains , which screen the magnetic field of neighbouring granules .",
    "the transition of a simple grain can reduce or eliminate this screening in such a way that the maximum surface field of the nearest granules can increase .",
    "consequently , transitions in several neighbours can occur almost simultaneously .",
    "diffusion of released heat , inherent to any first - order transition could also produce transitions in neighbouring grains .",
    "this avalanche effect could be useful for devices with very small granules to provide high - energy sensitivity or a triggering mechanism in high - energy particle experiments .",
    "avalanche experiments have been carried out on pass devices with different geometries , such as regular square configurations immersed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane , or systems of a few lines of microgranules with the magnetic field applied along the lines .",
    "results of these experiments show that the simultaneous flip of several granules are produced in these latter systems with a higher incidence than in the square configuration @xcite .",
    "the existence of partial avalanches and a lack of transitions of complete lines were explained as a consequence of imperfections in the manufacturing process @xcite .",

    "in the same work , and in agreement with other authors @xcite , the existence of a gap or interval of external field values for which no transitions occur was shown for concentrated systems .",
    "this corresponds to a hot border , in which only transitions by increasing temperature can be produced @xcite .",
    "this gap , which appears in concentrated configurations , but not in dilute systems , was related to transitions occurring in preferential positions , which induced spatial ordering .",
    "the presence of this ordering was found to be consistent with the value of the fraction @xmath2 of remaining superconducting microgranules for which the gap appears .",
    "this effect could have relevant consequences on the minimum energy detected by experimental detectors .    in this work we present the results corresponding to the other case : transitions in planar arrays with the magnetic field applied parallel to the system .",
    "a gap or plateau zone in the transition field values will be shown to exist for concentrated configurations , but not for dilute ones , for microgranules assumed to be microspheres with defects on their surface .",
    "this effect is similar to that produced in the perpendicular external field case , but appears for a higher fraction @xmath2 of remaining superconducting microgranules .",
    "the avalanche effect is hardly observed in these concentrated systems .",
    "an additional analysis is performed on pass with more perfect grains in order to reduce the influence of the defects on the response of the system . in this case",
    "all configurations , both concentrated and dilute , present plateau zones , but are shown to correspond to two types of different behaviour depending on lattice distance . for separated spheres ,",
    "transitions are produced in such a way that remaining superconducting spheres are ordered on complete lines when the plateau appears .",
    "after this zone , avalanches corresponding to transitions of these complete lines are observed .",
    "on the contrary , transitions in configurations with smaller lattice distances produce a quasi - homogeneous spatial distribution of remaining superconducting spheres in the plateau zone .",
    "furthermore , there are a smaller number of avalanches in the evolution of these concentrated systems , but which involve a larger number of spheres .",
    "we will explain the appearance of the plateau zone and develop a criterion to determine the lattice distance value that separates the two types of behaviour .",
    "these results are presented in this paper as follows : in the next section transitions undergone by systems corresponding to different lattice distances are analyzed .",
    "section iii is devoted to studying the behaviour of more perfect granules .",

    "we further assume that the latent heat corresponding to transitions is small enough so as not to affect bath temperature and not to originate transitions in neighbouring spheres .",

    "a change in the population of the two branches is produced , with an increment in the distance between both branches .",
    "the complete disappearance of the upper branch causes the system to enter the plateau zone and only granules with low surface magnetic field values remain superconducting , and are thus far from their threshold values .",
