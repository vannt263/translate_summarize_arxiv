    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , see e.g. gunn & knapp 1993 , gunn & weinberg 1995 ) will obtain deep ccd images of about @xmath0 steradians ( 10000 deg@xmath1 ) of sky centered on the north galactic cap in five bands , as well as spectra of approximately 1 million galaxies , 100,000 quasars and numerous stars selected from the photometric observations",
    ". it will detect about @xmath2 stellar objects and @xmath2 galaxies down to its limiting magnitude ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the five photometric bands ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) of the sdss cover the entire optical range from the uv atmospheric cutoff at about 3000   to the red silicon sensitivity cutoff at about 10000   ( fukugita _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , f96 hereafter ) .",
    "the sdss photometric system is based on the ab@xmath6 system defined in f96 .",
    "the zeropoints of each passband is defined by the observations of oke - gunn ( 1983 ) spectrophotometric standard stars .",
    "details of the photometric system is given in f96 and in appendix a. the sensitivity curves of the five bands ( including the contributions from the ccd , filter , telescope optics and average atmosphere transmission , see also appendix a ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spectra of a typical @xmath7 quasar and an f5v star are also plotted on figure 1 .",
    "the striking similarity of the overall shapes of these two spectra reveals the well - known difficulty of separating quasars at @xmath8 from normal stars using only broad - band colors (  6 ) .",
    "the scientific goals of the sdss require a detailed simulation of the distribution of objects in color space , as a function of position on the sky . in this paper",
    ", we present simulations of four kinds of stellar objects that sdss will observe : normal galactic stars , white dwarfs , quasars , and compact emission line galaxies ( celgs ) the software will classify as point sources .",
    "the work is motivated by two important scientific projects of the sdss :    \\1 .",
    "quasar selection .",
    "sdss will select quasar candidates according to both their morphology ( point source ) and colors .",
    "it will generate the biggest and most homogeneous quasar sample to date , covering redshift @xmath9 from 0 to @xmath10 .",
    "quasars will be selected as the outliers from the dense stellar locus in color space by the target selection pipeline ( newberg & yanny 1997 ) .",
    "however , objects such as white dwarfs , celgs and very blue or red stars also have colors different from normal stars , and are located outside of the stellar locus . selecting them as quasar candidates will lower the success rate of the quasar spectroscopic identifications .",
    "the quasar selection criteria need ( a ) to produce a high success rate for quasars , i.e. , to exclude possible non - quasar contaminants as much as possible (  6.3 ) ; ( b ) to select quasars as uniformly as possible , as a function of both sky position and redshift ; and ( c ) to select the quasar sample as complete as possible .",
    "the selection criteria will be determined using a limited amount of data during the commissioning period of the survey .",
    "we therefore need detailed modeling of the distribution of stellar objects in sdss color space , especially in the following senses : ( a ) modeling of the quasar colors as a function of redshift , ( b ) modeling of the distributions of possible contaminants of quasar candidates : white dwarfs , celgs and stars , both in color space and in different directions on the sky ; and ( c ) modeling of the photometric errors of the sdss , this is especially important for selecting faint quasars and high redshift quasars .",
    "\\2 . galactic structure .",
    "half of the sources that the sdss will detect will be stars in our galaxy .",
    "the sdss covers the whole northern galactic cap , roughly speaking , with galactic latitude @xmath11 .",
    "compared to previous data used for star count studies , it covers a much larger part of the sky , with 5 well - calibrated bands ( see appendix a ) , and high photometric accuracy .",
    "sdss is especially suitable for constraining galaxy models , in particular the properties of the halo and thick disk ; finding distinct groups or low surface brightness dwarf galaxies ( like the sagittarius dwarf ) in the halo ; and determining the distributions of interesting classes of stars like white dwarfs and carbon stars .",
    "all these studies require detailed modeling of the colors and spatial distributions of stars .",
    "the overall structure of the simulation presented in this paper is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "it has five independent parts : one general part to calculate and apply galactic extinction and random photometric errors in the sdss system ; and four special parts to simulate each of the four kind of stellar objects we consider in this paper .",
    "a point source model ( sky ) that predicts number counts of galactic and extragalactic sources is developed by cohen ( 1993 , see also wainscoat _",
    "_ 1992 , cohen 1994 ) .",
    "sky predicts number counts over a wide range of wavelengths from 1400   to 35 microns based on synthetic spectral library of 87 categories of sources .",
    "while the simulation presented in this paper has been fine - tuned to the sdss observations as well as to the studies of galactic structure and quasar selection from sdss data , sky will further provide valuable information on the classes of objects we do not attempt to simulation here (  2.4 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we discuss the simulations of stars , white dwarfs , quasars and celgs in  2  5 , respectively , following the structure shown in figure 2 . in each of these sections ,",
    "we first discuss the spectral models of those objects , then discuss the population models ( the spatial and luminosity distributions ) , and finally show the simulation results and compare them with test observations from the literature . in  6 , we first describe the distributions of stellar objects in the sdss color space in general , based on the simulations presented in the previous sections ; then we discuss the application of the simulation to quasar selection .",
    "we summarize the major conclusions of the paper in  7 . in the appendices , we provide more technical details of the simulation tools , including the realization of photometric errors ( appendix a ) , and simulation of quasar absorption systems ( appendix b ) .",
    "photometric surveys have been used as an important tool to study galactic structure and the evolutionary history of our galaxy ( for reviews , see bahcall 1986 and majewski 1993 ) .",
    "many computer models have been developed to interpret those data . among them",
    "are the classic star count models by bahcall & soneira ( 1980 , 1984 , bs hereafter ) , as well as gilmore ( 1984 ) and reid & majewski ( 1993 ) .",
    "these simulations are based on a galactic model ( disk+halo , sometimes with thick disk ) , and the observed luminosity function and color - magnitude diagram of each population .",
    "works by ng and collaborators based their simulated catalog on population synthesis models assuming the star formation history of our galaxy ( ng 1994 , ng",
    "_ et al . _",
    "et al _ ( 1997a , b , see also robin & crz 1986 , haywood 1994 ) based their models on the synthesis of both the evolution of stellar population and the dynamical evolution of vertical structure of the disk .",
    "our galactic simulation is based on :    1 .   the hybrid model stellar atmosphere libraries compiled by lejeune _",
    "( 1997a , b ) .",
    "we use them to calculate the sdss magnitudes of stars given the effective temperature @xmath12 , metallicity [ fe / h ] , and surface gravity @xmath13 ; 2 .   a simple stellar population synthesis model based on the padova stellar evolutionary tracks and isochrones ( bertelli _ et al .",
    "we use it to generate the simulated catalog of a given stellar population ; 3 .   a bs type galactic structure model ( with some modifications ) , including a galactic disk with scale height that grows in time , and a flattened galactic halo .",
    "we use it to generate the properties of stellar populations as a function of galactic position .",
    "we use the grids of theoretical stellar atmospheres compiled by lejeune _",
    "( 1997a , b ) .",
    "the grids are based on three different sets of models covering different parts of parameter space : ( 1 ) kurucz ( 1995 ) models in the temperature range of 3500  50000 k ; ( 2 ) allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) m - dwarf models in the temperature range of 2000  3500 k and @xmath14 ; and ( 3 ) fluks _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) synthetic spectra of m giants in the temperature range of 2500  3500 k and @xmath15 3 .",

    "we then calculate the sdss magnitudes of those grid spectra following appendix a. we interpolate between the grids linearly in @xmath18 , log @xmath17 and [ fe / h ] . for a compilation of sdss magnitudes based on kurucz ( 1995 ) models , see lenz _",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "atmospheres of late type stars are difficult to model .",
    "there is a noticeable discontinuity in the model stellar colors at @xmath19 3500 k , the transition region from kurucz models to those of allard & hauschildt ( see , e.g. , figure 4c ) .",
    "( 1997a , b ) further applied an empirical correction to the original atmosphere grids , so that the synthetic ubvri colors matched the empirical color - temperature calibrations from observed cool stars .",
    "this smooths the transition between models .",
    "however , the smoothed models produce a redder @xmath20 color for very cool stars than the observations of newberg _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) , possibly due to the differences between the sdss bands and the ubvri bands where those empirical corrections were derived .",
    "we therefore retain the original kurucz and allard & hauschildt grids , and leave the problem of calibrating the cool star color - temperature relation to further sdss observations .",
    "we use the padova library of isochrones (  5.2 of leitherer _ et al .",
    "the isochrones are calculated from the stellar evolution models of the padova group ( for @xmath21 , bertelli _ et al . _ 1994 ) with the aid of the vandenberg ( 1985 ) models for @xmath22 .",
    "the grids cover the metallicities of @xmath23=0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 and 0.1 .",
    "they correspond to [ fe / h ] = 1.7  + 0.7 assuming @xmath24 .",
    "each evolutionary sequence is followed from the zero age main sequence ( zams ) to the beginning of the thermally pulsing region of the agb phase for low and intermediate mass stars .",
    "we interpolate between the grid points linearly in z and log(age ) of the isochrones . for star with a given age , in the mass direction",
    ", we interpolate linearly in @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the zams mass of the star , and @xmath27 is the zams mass of the main sequence turnoff for that age .      in principle",
    ", one can simulate a stellar population from one of the two approaches .",
    "bs ( see also reid & majewski 1993 ) simulate stars based on observed luminosity functions ( lfs ) and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "this approach is sufficient for star count studies , especially those based on two or three colors .",
    "the sdss observations , however , cover five optical bands , with @xmath28 color sensitive to the changes in metallicity and luminosity class ( or @xmath13 , see also lenz _ et al .",
    "the lf does nt contain this information .",
    "therefore , we adopt an approach based on evolutionary stellar population synthesis , similar to the models described in haywood _",

    "( 1997 ) , using the observed properties of the initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) and the age - metallicity relation ( amr ) .",
    "our simulation consists of two distinct populations : a galactic disk with scale height growing in age , and a galactic halo .",

    "neither the imf nor the sfr of the disk is well - determined observationally ( majewski 1993 , scalo 1998 ) .",

    "( 1994a , b ) .",
    "the age of the disk is 10 gyr and the sfr is assumed to be constant in time for the past 10 gyr .",

    "note that for the old disk stars , the detailed slope at the high mass end is not important .",
    "we adopt the relation between metallicity and age of rana ( 1991 ) :    @xmath30_{mean } = 0.68 - 11.2/(20-\\rm t ) , \\rm   \\sigma([fe / h ] ) = 0.20\\ ] ]    where t is the age of the star in units of gyr , and @xmath31_{mean}$ ] is the average metallicity of that age , with a gaussian scatter of 0.20 .",
    "the disk has an average [ fe / h ] of 0.44 when it was formed ( 10 gyr ago ) and 0.12 at the present epoch .",

    "they are also located in different positions from the white dwarfs with similar temperature ( @xmath205 for bhbs , and @xmath206 for white dwarfs with similar temperature ) , due to the large difference in their surface gravities and therefore different strength of the balmer jump .",
    "it is not the goal of the current paper to discuss the quasar selection algorithm of the sdss in great detail .",
    "aspects of it are discussed in newberg & yanny ( 1997 ) .",
    "the final algorithm will be established during the sdss test year .",

    ", we plot the median distance and its 68% scatter of quasars from the stellar locus ( see  6.1 ) in color space as a function of redshift .",
    "we show both the distances based on three colors ( @xmath192 ) and based on the two redder colors .",
    "it demonstrates two problems with the separation of quasars from stars with colors .",
    "( 1 ) at redshift 2.5  3.0 , quasars move very close to the stellar locus in color space .",
    "some of the quasars have almost identical colors in all bands to blue halo stars as we saw above .",
    "any quasar selection based on color will miss a fraction of all quasars in this redshift range or will suffer a large contamination from stars .",
    "note that this redshift range is also where the quasar lf peaks (  4.2 ) .",
    "the evolution of the quasar population in this redshift range is important to cosmology .",
    "but we will unavoidably need a big selection correction here .",
    "detailed modeling of the quasar population , as we described in  4 , is crucial in determining the quasar selection function ( see also warren _",
    "( 2 ) for @xmath207 , quasars get increasingly redder in @xmath64 .",
    "they are well separated from the stellar locus .",
    "however , they will have very faint @xmath28 detections , or in most cases for @xmath208 , will be completely absent from the @xmath28 images .",
    "one has to use the lower limit in @xmath209 to separate quasars and stars .",
    "quasars with @xmath210 can have very similar @xmath20 , and @xmath66 colors to stars .",
    "quasars with very high redshift ( @xmath211 ) can be separated from stars based on @xmath20 and @xmath66 colors alone .",
    "white dwarfs , bhbs and celgs are also rare ( compared to normal stars ) and are well separated from the stellar locus . simply by selecting objects as outliers from the stellar locus ( e.g.",
    "newberg & yanny 1997 ) will include those contaminants in the quasar candidate list .",
    "white dwarfs will outnumber quasars for @xmath212 , while celgs have a number density about 25% of that of quasars at the faint end ( koo _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . in figure 20",
    ", we show the separation of quasars in the redshift range @xmath213 and stars / white dwarfs / celgs . as discussed in  6.1 , hot white dwarfs ( with @xmath214 8000 k ) have similar @xmath64 but bluer @xmath20 color than quasars ; a cut at @xmath215 will eliminate most of them . at @xmath212 ,",
    "most of the white dwarfs are hot and have @xmath216 . at @xmath217 , there are more cooler white dwarfs , and @xmath75 60% of white dwarfs can be eliminated in this way .",

    "we do not simulate the colors of normal galaxies that may appear stellar for the sdss .",
    "we also do not simulate various kinds of peculiar stars ( see  3.4 ) . with these exceptions aside , we have covered the major classes of stellar objects that the sdss will observe at high galactic latitudes . in this paper , we present the models of the spatial and spectral distributions for each type of object .",
    "we also add realistic photometric errors and galactic extinction in the simulation .",
    "simulated catalogs of sdss observations towards several directions on the sky are available at ` http://www.astro.princeton.edu/^{\\sim}fan/sdss_simu.html ` .",
    "we simulate the distribution of stars based on ( 1 ) evolutionary stellar population synthesis models of the disk and halo populations , using the padova stellar isochrones and lejeune _ et al . _ s ( 1997a , b ) stellar atmosphere libraries ; ( 2 ) a bahcall - soneira ( 1984 ) type galactic model , including a disk whose height grows with stellar age , and a flattened stellar halo .",
    "the disk stars are separated from the halo stars in color - magnitude diagrams as well as in color - color space .",
    "the simulation tools will be very useful for constraining galactic star count models as well as for finding peculiar stars .",
    "we simulate the distribution of white dwarf stars based on ( 1 ) their observed spatial distribution ( similar to old disk stars ) , luminosity function and mass distribution ; ( 2 ) h and he white dwarf atmosphere models ( bergeron _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) that transfer white dwarf properties to the sdss magnitude system .",
    "we show that white dwarfs outnumber quasars for @xmath219 at moderate galactic latitude .",
    "hot white dwarfs can be easily picked out ( and separated from low redshift quasars ) from their positions in color space .",
    "we simulate the distribution of compact emission line galaxies based on ( 1 ) the luminosity and emission line strength distribution from ssg ; ( 2 ) the continuum slope distribution from mcquade _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) ; and ( 3 ) the size distribution of the um sample ( salzer _ et al _ 1989 ) .",
    "we show that down to the sdss spectroscopic survey limit of @xmath220 , about half of the emission line galaxies will be so compact that they can not be distinguished from stars based on sdss images .",
    "those galaxies occupy a similar place in color space to that of quasars , but the majority of them are redder than low - redshift quasars .",
    "we simulate the distribution of quasars based on ( 1 ) a quasar spectral model , which includes the observed distributions of power - law continuum , optical / uv emission lines and large number of absorption systems due to intervening neutral hydrogen ; and ( 2 ) the evolution of the luminosity function of quasars .",
    "we show how the colors of quasars evolve with redshift .",
    "the low redshift ( @xmath221 ) quasars can be easily separated from stars and hot white dwarfs , when more than two colors are used in the selection .",
    "the colors of high - redshift quasars are dominated by absorption blueward of ly @xmath84 emission , and are well - separated from the stellar locus .",
    "the colors of quasars with @xmath65 , however , are easily confused with hot halo stars , especially halo blue horizontal branch stars , and relative cool ( @xmath222 k ) white dwarfs .",
    "we also discuss the separation of quasars from other types of objects using color in more detail , and suggest that a color cut in @xmath20 will eliminate most of the emission line galaxies and hot white dwarfs , which themselves are also well - separated from the stellar locus , and could be selected as quasar candidates otherwise . for @xmath65 , on the other hand , quasars fall very close to the stellar locus",
    ". this effect is also a function of galactic position , with stellar population depending on direction .",
    "the simulation is used to establish and test the quasar selection criteria for the sdss survey .",
    "we show the relative distribution of different type of objects in color space .",
    "all four kinds of stellar objects are distributed basically on the same plane in color space , as previously pointed out by newberg _",
    "( 1999 ) from test observations using sdss filters .",
    "this is due to the fact that ( 1 ) the red part of optical stellar spectra does not deviate much from a black - body ; and ( 2 ) the power law continuum that dominates the colors of quasars and celgs also lies close to this plane .",
    "changes in stellar metallicity , gravity and reddening mostly result in scatter of the stellar distribution _ within _ this plane .",
    "the simulation developed in this paper will be thoroughly tested and improved when comparing with the soon - available sdss survey data .",
    "it will be a very useful tool both for the study of galactic structure and the selection of peculiar objects from the sdss survey .",
