    "stochastic parameterizations have been investigated intensively for quantifying uncertainties in mathematical models of physical , geophysical , environmental , and biological systems .",
    "we may roughly classify such uncertainties into two kinds . the first kind of uncertainties may be called model uncertainty .",
    "they involve with physical processes that are less known , not yet well understood , not well - observed or measured , difficult to be described in the mathematical models , or otherwise ignored in the usual deterministic modeling .",
    "parameterizations of model uncertainties have been considered in , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the second kind of uncertainties may be called simulation uncertainty .",
    "this arises in numerical simulations of multiscale systems that display a wide range of spatial and temporal scales , with no clear scale separation . due to the limitations of computer power , at present and for the conceivable future , not all scales of variability",
    "can be explicitly simulated or resolved .",
    "although these unresolved scales may be very small or very fast , their long time impact on the resolved simulation may be delicate ( i.e. , may be negligible or may have significant effects , or in other words , uncertain ) .",
    "thus , to take the effects of unresolved scales on the resolved scales into account , representations or parameterizations of these effects are required @xcite .    the present paper deals with simulation uncertainty , i.e. , stochastically parameterizing the effects of the unresolved scales on the resolved scales .",
    "we consider this issue in the context of large eddy simulations ( les ) of a nonlinear partial differential equation with memory .",
    "relevant existing works include @xcite .",
    "in large eddy simulations of fluid or geophysical fluid flows @xcite , the unresolved scales appear as the so - called subgrid scales ( sgs ) .",
    "the sgs term appears to be highly fluctuating (  random \" ) ; see the figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "partially motivated by this , stochastic parameterizations of subgrid scales have been investigated in fluid , geophysical and climate simulations , based on physical or intuitive or empirical arguments .",
    "another , perhaps more important , motivation for applying stochastic parameterizations of subgrid scales is to induce the desired backward energy flux (  stochastic backscatter \" ) in fluid simulations @xcite .",
    "we present one stochastic parameterization scheme of the subgrid scale term in the large eddy simulation of a nonlinear partial differential equation with an extra memory term , which is in fact a nonlinear integro - partial differential equation .",
    "the approximation scheme is based on stochastic calculus involving with a fractional brownian motion , and the  parameter to be calculated is a spatial function , which is derived using ito stochastic calculus .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after introducing large eddy simulations in  2",
    ", we discuss fractional brownian motions and colored noise in  3 , and devise a stochastic parameterization scheme of the subgrid scales in details in  3 and  4 , respectively . finally ,",
    "in  5 , we demonstrate this stochastic parameterization scheme by a few numerical experiments on solving a nonlinear partial differential equation with memory .",
    "as an example , we consider the following nonlinear partial differential equation with a memory term ( time - integral term ) @xmath0 under appropriate initial condition @xmath1 and boundary conditions @xmath2 with @xmath3 constants , on a bounded domain @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is a positive constant .",
    "this model arises in mathematical modeling in ecology @xcite , heat conduction in certain materials @xcite and materials science @xcite . the time - integral term here represents a memory effect depending on the past history of the system state , and this memory effect decays polynomially fast in time .",
    "the large eddy solution @xmath6 is the true solution @xmath7 looked through a filter : i.e. , through convolution with a spatial filter @xmath8 , with spatial scale ( or filter size or cut - off size ) @xmath9 : @xmath10 in this paper , we use a gaussian filter as in @xcite , @xmath11 .    on convolving ( [ heat ] ) with @xmath12 ,",
    "the large eddy solution @xmath13 is to satisfy @xmath14 or @xmath15 where the remainder term , i.e. , the subgrid scale ( sgs ) term @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17    we can write @xmath18 with @xmath13 the large eddy term and @xmath19 the fluctuating term . note that @xmath20 .",
    "so the sgs term @xmath16 involves nonlinear interactions of fluctuations @xmath19 and the large eddy flows .",
    "thus @xmath16 may be regarded as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath19 : @xmath21 .",
    "the leads to a possibility of approximating @xmath16 by a suitable stochastic process defined on a probability space @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , the sample space , @xmath24field @xmath25 and probability measure @xmath26 .",
    "this means that we treat @xmath27 data as random data as in @xcite , which take different realizations , e.g. , due to fluctuating observations or due to numerical simulation with initial and boundary conditions with small fluctuations . in fluid or geophysical fluid simulations",
    ", the sgs term may be highly fluctuating and time - correlated @xcite , and this term may be inferred from observational data @xcite , or from fine mesh simulations .",
    "in fact , in our case study here , the subgrid scale term @xmath28 is clearly time - correlated ; see fig .",
    "the ( averaged ) time correlation function here , over a computational time interval @xmath29 $ ] , is defined as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes covariance , and @xmath32 is the standard deviation .      averaged time correlation of the subgrid scale term @xmath16 , at @xmath33 , for @xmath34_,width=384,height=288 ]    this further suggests for parameterizing the subgrid scale term @xmath16 as a time - correlated or colored noisy term .    before we devise how we parameterize the subgrid scale term @xmath35 as a colored noise or time - correlated term , we first discuss fractional brownian motion and colored noise in the next section .",
    "we first discuss a model of colored noise in terms of fractional brownian motion .",
    "the fractional brownian motion is a generalization of the more well - known process of brownian motion .",
    "it is a centered gaussian process with stationary increments .",
    "however , the increments of the fractional brownian motion are not independent , except in the standard brownian case ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the dependence structure of the increments is modeled by a so called hurst parameter @xmath37 . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "+   + definition of fractional brownian motion : for @xmath38 , a gaussian process @xmath39 , or @xmath40 , is a fractional brownian motion if it starts at zero @xmath41 , has mean zero @xmath42 = 0 $ ] , and has covariance @xmath43 = \\frac12(|t|^{2h } + |s|^{2h } - |t - s|^{2h})$ ] for all t and s. the standard brownian motion is a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath36 . +   + some properties of fractional brownian motion : a fractional brownian motion @xmath44 has the following properties : + ( i ) it has stationary increments ; + ( ii ) when @xmath45 , it has independent increments ; + ( iii ) when @xmath46 , it is neither markovian , nor a semimartingale .",
    "+ the exact simulation of @xmath47 is in general computationally very expensive . the cholesky decomposition method , which is to our knowledge a known exact method for the non - equidistant simulation of fractional brownian motion , requires @xmath48 operations .",
    "moreover the covariance matrix , which has to be decomposed , is ill - conditioned .",
    "if the discretization is equidistant , i.e. , @xmath49 , the computational cost can be lowered considerably .",
    "for example , the davis - harte algorithm for the equidistant simulation of fractional brownian motion has computational cost @xmath50 ; see , e.g. , craigmile @xcite .",
    "here we use the weierstrass - mandelbrot function to approximate the fractional brownian motion .",
    "the basic idea is to simulate fractional brownian motion by randomizing a representation due to weierstrass . given the hurst parameter @xmath51 with @xmath52 , we define the function @xmath53 to approximate the fractional brownian motion : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant , @xmath56 s are normally distributed random variables with mean @xmath57 and standard deviation @xmath58 , and the @xmath59 s are uniformly distributed random variables in the interval @xmath60 .",
    "the underlying theoretical foundation for this approximation can be found in @xcite .",
    "2 shows a sample path of the fractional brownian motion , when hurst parameter @xmath61 .    , with @xmath62_,width=384,height=288 ]    the increments of fractional brownian motion are correlated in time .",
    "this motivates us to parameterize the subgrid scale term @xmath28 , which is time - correlated , by using colored noise @xmath63 .",
    "we thus parameterize the subgrid scale term @xmath28 term above as a mean component plus a colored noise . to be more specific , we model @xmath16 as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a colored noise , and @xmath66 is the mean component of the subgrid scale term @xmath28 . moreover , the noise intensity @xmath67 is a non - negative deterministic function to be determined from fluctuating sgs data @xmath27 .",
    "the subgrid scale term @xmath16 may be inferred from observational data @xcite , or from fine mesh simulations as we do here .",
    "we represent the mean component @xmath68 in terms of the large eddy solution @xmath13 .",
    "the specific form for @xmath69 depends on the nature of the mean of @xmath27 .",
    "here we take @xmath70 , where coefficients @xmath71 s are determined via data fitting by minimizing @xmath72 ^ 2dx dt$ ] .",
    "moreover , we take @xmath73 as a scalar fractional brownian motion .",
    "note that @xmath74 is to be calculated or estimated from the fluctuating sgs data @xmath27 , either from observation or ( in this paper ) from fine mesh simulations ; see detailed discussions in @xcite .",
    "so this is an inverse problem . as in usual inverse problems",
    "@xcite , the stochastic parameterizations for the sgs term @xmath27 is not unique .",
    "this offers an opportunity for trying various stochastic parameterization schemes , much as one uses various smoother functions ( e.g. , polynomials or fourier series ) to approximate less regular functions or data in deterministic approximation theory .    to estimate the unknown parameter ( function ) @xmath67 , we start with - to get the following relation : @xmath75 taking time integral over a computational interval @xmath76 $ ] on both sides , we obtain @xmath77dt   =   \\int_0^t \\sigma(x )   d{b}^h_t = \\sigma(x ) b^h_t.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore",

    "note that a four times coarser mesh simulation with no stochastic parameterization for the original system ( [ heat ] ) does not generate satisfactory results ; see fig .",
