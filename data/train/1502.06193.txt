    "models in the form of coupled oscillators are ubiquitous in various scientific fields , ranging from physics and chemistry  @xcite to biology  @xcite , as well as in some interdisciplinary applications  @xcite . in many cases dynamics of oscillatory ensemble",
    "can be successfully studied in the phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "when the coupling between the oscillators is relatively weak , one can neglect changes in the amplitude dynamics of natural limit cycles of the oscillators , and describe the system in terms of the phases only .",
    "this technique is known as phase reduction , and it represents , basically , one of the few rigorous mathematical approaches to study complex non - equilibrium nonlinear oscillatory dynamics .",
    "the simplest setup here represents a globally coupled ensemble with weak interaction and relatively close natural frequencies .",
    "the phase reduction here leads to the system of globally coupled phase equations where interaction between the oscillators is described by @xmath0 - periodic function of phase differences  @xcite .",
    "the classical and well - studied kuramoto - sakaguchi model appears when one consider only the first fourier mode in the interaction function what leads to simple sinusoidal coupling .",
    "there is almost 40 years of intensive studies dedicated to explanation of bifurcations and dynamics in this model  @xcite .",
    "a surprising recent result discovered a possibility of low - dimensional description of the classical kuramoto model in terms of macroscopic order parameters  @xcite .",
    "however , this reduction to low - dimensional systems does not imply simplicity of dynamical behavior .",
    "in opposite , the authors @xcite report on quite complicated phase transitions and bifurcations in the kuramoto - sakaguchi models .",
    "the cases of multi - harmonic coupling functions  @xcite appear to be more complicated and usually responsible for new dynamical effects in comparison to classical setup with purely sinusoidal function .",
    "in large ensembles the multi - harmonic case leads to appearance of so - called multi - branch entrainment modes with a huge multiplicity of possible synchronous solutions  @xcite .",
    "the latter also leads to non - trivial noise - induced effects  @xcite .",
    "one of the directions in this growing theoretical field is dedicated to _ multi - frequency _ oscillator communities . as it was mentioned before",
    ", the kuramoto - type models were obtained under assumptions of weak coupling limit and closeness of natural oscillator frequencies . however",
    ", when the distribution of the frequencies is huge in comparison to the interaction strength , the phase reduction leads to another types of phase models  @xcite .",
    "a natural setup here implies existence of a certain number of oscillator subpopulations ( communities ) , such that the frequencies inside each population are close , but differ significantly across the distinct communities .",
    "this situation is inspired by theoretical and experimental results from neuroscience  @xcite , indicating that distinct interacting brain areas exhibit different natural oscillatory rhythms .    in this paper",
    "we consider a particular problem when distinct oscillatory communities have natural frequencies close to a high - order resonance .",
    "first , we derive general phase equations for globally interacting ensembles and distinguish different types of resonant coupling which may appear in the system .",
    "next , we concentrate on the simplest case of two interacting population whose mean frequencies are close to an 2:1 resonance .",
    "the aim of the paper is to demonstrate on this simplest example , what one can expect from the effects high - order resonances . to describe the dynamics",
    ", we adopt the self - consistent approach developed in  @xcite for calculation of stationary order parameters for multi - harmonic coupling functions .",
    "our analysis will show that the model exhibits reach dynamical behavior including multi - branch entrainment ( multiplicity ) and chaotic collective oscillations .",
    "in this section we will present a general scheme of coupling in resonant , multifrequency populations of oscillators .",
    "we will assume that each oscillator is described solely by its phase @xmath1 , which satisfies the following equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is oscillator s natural frequency , @xmath4 is its phase response curve , and @xmath5 is the force acting from other oscillators . in order to simplify notations , we from the beginning will consider a thermodynamic limit , where the number of units in all populations and subpopulations tends to infinity ( although at the end we will also write the governing equations for a finite size case ) .",
    "we assume that the ensemble is divided into @xmath6 distinct subpopulations ( we will use index @xmath7 for referring to them ) , around @xmath6 distinct mean frequencies @xmath8 .",
    "additionally , there can be a small deviation from the mean frequency @xmath9 ( typically described by a unimodal distribution around zero ) .",
    "we now introduce slow phases , by writing explicitly fast rotating terms @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , we can also chose frequencies of fast rotations @xmath11 to be close , but not exactly equal , to @xmath8 .",
    "we will use this freedom to be able to make perfect averaging below .",
    "our slow phases @xmath12 satisfy equations @xmath13 where now individual mismatches @xmath9 for the group @xmath7 are distributed generally asymmetrically , with some small shift @xmath14 .",
    "next , we assume that coupling between the groups and inside each group is due to mean fields only .",
    "these mean fields for each subpopulation are represented by generalized order parameters @xmath15 where averaging is over the distribution of the slow phases following from and over the distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "the introduced order parameters @xmath16 are slow functions of time as they are defined via the slow phases : @xmath17 in general , the force acting on the oscillators of the group @xmath7 is from all other groups , and is a nonlinear function of order parameters , which one can expand in powers of them .",
    "we , however , in this paper will restrict ourselves to the linear coupling only , i.e. we will assume that @xmath18 is a linear function of order parameters : @xmath19    representing the phase response function @xmath20 as a fourier series @xmath21 and substituting this in eq .  , we obtain @xmath22=\\\\ & = \\delta+\\sum_{p , k , m } s_{np } h_{n , k}^{(m ) }   \\overline{z}_k^{(m ) } e^{ip\\varphi}e^{i(p\\omega_n + ik\\omega_m ) t }   \\end{aligned } \\label{eq : slph2}\\ ] ]    now one has to perform averaging of eq .  , to reveal evolution of the slow phase .",
    "the fast terms on the r.h.s . are those containing explicit time dependence with one of the frequencies @xmath11 or with a combination of them",
    ". such a combination can be small , this is exactly the case of a resonance that is of special interest for us .",
    "here , we use the freedom in the choice of particular values of @xmath11 , to make the resonance exact .",
    "this means that some combination of frequencies @xmath11 vanishes exactly .",
    "performing averaging means just keeping these terms on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .  , and neglecting all other containing explicit time dependence .",
    "expansion   can be treated in many setups of particular resonant conditions , we describe here some evident cases :    * one population of oscillators . in this case",
    "only one frequency @xmath23 exists . here",
    "the only terms surviving the averaging are those with @xmath24 , this leads to the daido model  @xcite . *",
    "two subpopulations . here",
    "the main interest is in the resonance of two frequencies @xmath25 .",
    "the simplest case is just the second - harmonic resonance : @xmath26 . in this case",
    "only those cross - population coupling terms with @xmath27 survive . similarly , for high - order resonances like @xmath28 ( with integer @xmath29 ) the terms with @xmath30 contribute .",
    "* more than two subpopulations .",
    "one can see from  , that in the case of linear coupling , there is no direct interaction involving more that two subpopulations .",
    "so the resulting coupling is a combination of terms stemming from pairwise resonances .",
    "we restrict ourself in this paper to the simplest case of two resonant subpopulations with @xmath26 . as described above , after averaging only terms where combinations @xmath31 and @xmath32 appear , survive , for the interaction within one and between subpopulations , respectively : @xmath33 we now insert here the definition of the slow order parameters   and obtain @xmath34 where averaging is over variables with tilde .",
    "now we can define effective coupling functions inside subpopulations @xmath35 and coupling functions across subpopulation @xmath36 as @xmath37 now we can formulate equations for finite populations , replacing @xmath38 by corresponding sums .",
    "we assume that subpopulations 1 and 2 have @xmath39 and @xmath40 units , respectively .",
    "furthermore , one can now also transform back to the original fast phases , because in the averaged formulation the absolute values of the frequencies do not play any rle . denoting the phases in the subpopulation at a smaller frequency ( we will also call it the first subpopulation below ) as @xmath41 , and the phases in the subpopulation at a larger frequency ( referred hereafter as the second subpopulation ) as @xmath42 , we get @xmath43 where we also have split notations for frequencies in two subpopulations . this system is a generalization of the daido model  @xcite to two resonantly coupled ensembles .",
    "below we will consider the case where coupling functions @xmath44 contain the first harmonics only ; this will correspond to the kuramoto - sakaguchi - type coupling . in this case",
    "each coupling function is determined by two parameters , the amplitude and the phase shift .",
    "one of the phase shifts in the cross - coupling can be set to zero by shifting all the phases in one subpopulation with respect to another one .",
    "thus , our coupling functions will be : @xmath45    next , we fix the distributions of the frequencies . as after the averaging the system is invariant under transformation @xmath46 , @xmath47 for arbitrary @xmath48 , we can set the average value of the natural frequencies in the first subpopulation @xmath1 to zero , the average frequency @xmath49 in the second subpopulation is the relevant parameter responsible for the mismatch .",
    "we will assume the frequencies to be distributed according to lorentzian distributions , with equal widths . because we still have a freedom of changing the time scale",
    ", we will assume that this width is one : @xmath50 the resulting microscopic system of oscillators to be considered below reads @xmath51 with frequencies defined according to the distributions  .",
    "we now also write down the basic equations in the thermodynamic limit . here",
    "three complex order parameters @xmath52 appear defined as @xmath53 while equations for the phases are @xmath54",
    "the formulated system of equation will be subject of our analysis below , where we will concentrate on main dynamical effects caused by resonant cross - coupling .",
    "in numerical simulations we will use microscopic equations  , while in the theoretical construction the thermodynamic limit formulation  ( [ eq : opxy],[eq : pheqthl ] ) will be used .",
    "here we will present the self - consistent scheme allowing us to find stationary ( or , more generally , uniformly rotating ) synchronous solutions of the system ( [ eq : opxy],[eq : pheqthl ] ) .",
    "the problem partially simplifies by the observation , that for the subpopulation @xmath55 at the double frequency the ott - antonsen ansatz  @xcite can be applied .",
    "indeed , the second of eqs .   can be rewritten as @xmath56 according to the ott - antonsen theory , equation for the order parameter @xmath57 obeys ( under some additional assumptions which we assume to be satisfied here ) , in the case of a lorentzian distribution  , an ode @xmath58      we now construct solution for the ensemble of oscillators @xmath59 . here",
    "we can not use the ott - antonsen ansatz , because the latter is only applicable for the driving terms possessing one harmonics of the phase , like in  .",
    "the equations for @xmath59 possesses both the first and the second harmonics . in order to find stationary values of the mean fields",
    ", we will adapt the self - consistent scheme developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for the deterministic bi - harmonic kuramoto model ( for the noisy case a similar method can be used , see  @xcite ) .    in this self - consistent approach",
    "one finds uniformly rotating distributions , i.e. distributions that are stationary in a rotating reference frame .",
    "let us denote the frequency of this frame @xmath23 , it will be determined self - consistently as a result of the calculations . according to this ,",
    "we introduce constant phases of the order parameters @xmath60 ( here the phase shift of the first order parameter @xmath61 is set to zero , this can be always done by the time shift ) .",
    "also , we introduce a new phase variable @xmath62 distribution of which is expected to be stationary .",
    "this variable obeys @xmath63      to proceed with self - consistent solution , it is convenient to introduce four auxiliary parameters @xmath64 in the following way : @xmath65    now ( [ eq : bkm ] ) takes the following form : @xmath66 we denoted @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at some constant values of parameters @xmath69 in ( [ eq : bkm_first ] ) , at each value of @xmath70",

    "after analysing general possible resnonant terms in linear mean - field coupling , we focused on the simplest high - order resonant case , when two communities of oscillators are globally coupled and have natural population frequencies close to the rational relation 2:1 .",
    "first , given the assumption on mean population frequencies , we derived the simplest form of phase equations for high - order resonant interaction between two globally coupled communities of oscillators .",
    "basically , the structure of the model consists of two main parts : the first part represents classical sinusoidal term describing kuramoto - type interaction inside each community ; the second component has different form , it represents the resonant cross- coupling between the populations .",

    "how cross - coupling promotes synchronization , and looked for novel dynamical effects due to the high - order resonance .",
    "hence , we have considered two qualitatively different cases , in the first case the populations were internally asynchronous , so , the internal coupling strength was relatively weak .",
    "here we constructed the bifurcation diagram showing how synchronous regimes appear in dependence on main parameters of the model .",
    "we demonstrated , that strong enough resonant cross - coupling results in stationary synchronous solutions appearing in both subpopulations . thus , the synchrony can be only mutual .",

    "we considered an opposite situation , when the internal coupling is strong , such that almost all oscillators are locked to the mean fields in the absence of the cross- coupling . here",
    "we report on a quite non - trivial effect , that the cross - coupling can destroy the stationary synchronous state introducing chaos into the system .",
    "mean fields of two subpopulations not only vary their amplitude chaotically , but the subpopulations also desynchronize from each other in the sense , that the phase shift between the mean fields is no more a constant , but performs a biased random walk .",
