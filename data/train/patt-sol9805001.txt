    "convection in binary miscible fluids like , e. g. , ethanol  water or @xmath0he@xmath1he is a well established and accepted system for studying instabilities , bifurcations , complex spatiotemporal behaviour , and turbulence .",
    "this is on the one hand due to its sufficiently simple experimental realization under well controllable conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "a great advantage for the theoretical analysis is the solid knowledge of the governing field equations .",
    "so , recently a lot of research activities @xcite have been directed towards investigating the enormous variety of pattern forming behaviour in this system .",
    "the richness of spatio temporal phenomena in binary fluid mixtures stems from a feed  back loop between the fields of velocity , concentration , and temperature .",
    "let us start with the velocity field : the convective flow is driven by the buoyancy force field which itself is determined by variations of the temperature and of the concentration field .",
    "the latter are on the one hand generated via the thermodiffusive soret effect by temperature gradients and on the other hand they are reduced by concentration diffusion and by mixing due to the convective flow . since these changes influence the buoyancy which drives the flow the feed back loop is closed .",
    "in this article we concentrate on the soret coupling and its influence on spatially extended convection states of straight parallel rolls that occur either as a horizontally traveling wave ( tw ) or in the form of stationary `` overturning '' convection ( soc ) rolls . among others , we elucidate the soret induced changes in the combined soc ",
    "tw bifurcation topology which offers in both types of convection the possibility of sub and supercritically bifurcating branches depending on the strength of the soret coupling .",
    "both solution branches develop with increasing soret coupling saddle node bifurcations which give rise to stability changes .",
    "finally , there exists a merging point of the soc and the tw branches for moderate negative soret couplings .",
    "this competition of stationary and traveling states can only be observed for negative soret coupling , where temperature gradients induce adverse concentration gradients that stabilize the unstable thermal layering . for positive soret couplings",
    ", there is no oscillatory instability of the basic state .",
    "the two interesting cases for negative coupling are now _ weak _ and _ strong _ soret effect . for the latter one a bistability of slow and fast tws",
    "was recently reported @xcite which coexist with the likewise stable basic state of heat conduction .",
    "a detailed phase diagram was discussed @xcite describing the soret dependence of the saddle nodes . for weak soret couplings , however , a detailed study of the bifurcation toplogy was missing .",
    "data from direct numerical simulations are sparse since in the vicinity of saddle nodes and bifurcation points the intrinsic time scale of the system is arbitrarily long .",
    "thus , phase diagrams to elucidate the whole bifurcation topology were incomplete .",
    "we have determined the soc and tw fixed points of the system by a many mode galerkin scheme whose convergence properties do not depend on the time scale of the system .",
    "in particular , this allowed us to study all unstable branches on which , especially , the transition from weakly to strongly nonlinear convection takes place .",
    "furthermore , a detailed explanation of the concentration distribution and its relation to convection is given .",
    "our article is organized as follows : the * second * section presents the system , the fields needed for its description , their governing equations with the explanation of the relevant fluid and control parameters .",
    "finally , it presents a short survey on the typical bifurcation scenario in the convection of binary liquid mixtures with negative soret coupling .",
    "the * third * section shows the field truncations , the method of solving the system and the solutions of our many mode galerkin scheme basing on a reasonable approximation in the velocity field . in the * fourth * section",
    "we discuss the influence of the soret coupling on the bifurcation topology by means of exemplary bifurcation diagrams realized in experimentally feasible mixtures and a detailed phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , evidence for an instability of a tw towards a modulated tw ( mtw ) is given .",
    "the fluid parameter range for its occurence is elucidated for ethanol  water as well as for @xmath0he@xmath1he  mixtures .",
    "finally , we extract the relation between concentration distribution and convective structure and we investigate the importance of the soret effect at the boundaries and its neglibility in the bulk .",

    "mostly we scale it by the value of the onset of convection in a pure fluid : @xmath41    the convective states of the system are characterized by four order parameters :    \\(i ) the maximum @xmath42 of the vertical velocity field .",

    "the better the fluid is mixed the more the concentration is globally equilibrated to its mean value @xmath46 so that @xmath47 vanishes in optimally mixing , strongly convecting states .",
    "\\(iv ) the frequency @xmath48 of a traveling wave .",
    "thus , extended tws with a wave number @xmath49 have a phase velocity @xmath50 .",
    "they are stationary states in a reference frame comoving with @xmath51 relative to the laboratory system .      for fluid parameters typically realized in mixtures of water and about 10 wt.% ethanol , an oscillatory , subcritical onset of convection is observed .",
    "it is connected by an unstable tw branch with a saddle node bifurcation giving rise to stable , strongly nonlinear tw states . at a certain rayleigh number , the phase velocity of these waves vanishes and the soc branch of stable stationary states can be observed .",
    "along the tw bifurcation branch which is shown in detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : bifoverview ] the concentration changes its structure from lateral homogeneity and vertically linear layering in the basic state over plateau  like distributions in fast tws to boundary layer dominated , slowly traveling waves ( see the discussion and the figures in sec .  [",

    "the contrast between two adjacent tw rolls is strongly related to the phase velocity of the tw and it vanishes with this velocity .",
    "so , socs do not show such a concentration contrast . in socs adjacent rolls",
    "are mirror images of each other and they are separated from another and from the top and bottom plate only by thin boundary layers . the latter are a typical phenomenon for convection of weakly diffusing scalars .",
    "in liquid binary mixtures like ethanol - water momentum diffuses approximately ten times faster than heat .",
    "this means that the prandtl number @xmath52 is of @xmath53 so that the velocity field may be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "then , the momentum balance ( [ eq : baleqveloc ] ) , say in vertical direction , reduces to the balance of the diffusive term @xmath54 and the buoyant term @xmath55 with the latter containing no derivatives .",
    "thus , in a stationary flow , either in the laboratory frame or in a comoving one , the amplitudes of higher lateral fourier modes @xmath56 of the vertical velocity field @xmath57 scale at least like @xmath58 so that they decrease rapidly and even faster than those of the temperature field . that is the reason why higher modes than the critical first lateral fourier mode are not necessary for a good description of the velocity field .",
    "one can expect this to hold for all @xmath59 .",
    "the next question deals with the role of the lateral mean of the velocity field , i.  e. , of its zeroth lateral fourier mode .",
    "continuity implies that only the lateral velocity field @xmath60 can contain such a mean flow . in order to determine the relevance of a @xmath61dependent mean flow we compare its maximum with the two other velocities in the system : the maximal vertical flow velocity @xmath42 and the phase velocity @xmath51 of tws . just at the onset of convection , the mean",
    "flow may be estimated @xcite to scale with @xmath62 and to be very small in comparison with @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , mean flow and phase velocity have the same sign . in strongly nonlinear states ,",
    "the ratio of flow velocity and mean flow is nearly @xmath63 @xcite , but has changed sign .",
    "thus , the mean flow has a non  monotonous dependence on the phase and flow velocity whereas all other properties of tws like mixing and heat transport vary monotonically .",
    "hence , the mean flow can not contribute systematically to these properties characterizing tws sufficiently .",
    "this is the reason , together with the smallness of the mean flow , for ignoring it altogether .",
    "the @xmath61dependence of the critical velocity field is described in an adequate manner ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) by the first even chandrasekhar function @xcite @xmath64 .",

    "a further result the reason for the failure of earlier galerkin approximations for the convection in binary liquid mixtures was revealed : in order to _ exactly _ fulfill the concentration boundary condition which is coupled to the temperature field earlier approaches used a combination of concentration and temperature field without resolving the temperature field adequately . when using this combined field for small lewis numbers",
    "@xmath242 a resolution of the temperature is required that goes beyond the dominating modes seen in simulations and experiments .",
    "although the contribution of higher modes to the temperature field are small they are essential in the balance equations formulated with the combined field . a way out of this artificial theoretical dilemma is obtained by investigating the concentration current : it is mainly influenced by the lateral average of the temperature gradient in the system .",
