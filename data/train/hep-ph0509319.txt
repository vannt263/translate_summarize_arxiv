    "the vector manifestation ( vm ) was proposed  @xcite as a novel manifestation of wigner realization of chiral symmetry where the vector meson @xmath0 becomes massless at the chiral phase transition point .",
    "accordingly , the ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 becomes the chiral partner of the nambu - goldstone boson @xmath1 .",
    "the vm provides a strong support for brown - rho scaling  @xcite which predicted that the mass of light - quark hadrons should drop in proportion to the quark condensate @xmath2 .",
    "actually , the dilepton spectra observed in the kek - ps e325  @xcite and the cbelsa / taps  @xcite as well as in the cern / sps  @xcite can be explained by the dropping mass of @xmath0/@xmath3 based on the brown - rho scaling  @xcite .    in this",
    "write - up , i first briefly review the difference between the vm and the conventional manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration based on the linear sigma model in section  [ sec : vm ] .",
    "then , i show how to formulate the vm in hot matter in section  [ sec : vmt ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : sum ] , i give a brief summary .",
    "let me discuss the difference between the vm and the conventional manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration based on the linear sigma model , the gl manifestation , in terms of the chiral representation of the low - lying mesons by extending the analyses done in ref .   for two flavor qcd .",
    "the vm is characterized by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the decay constant of ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 at @xmath0 on - shell .",
    "this is completely different from the gl manifestation where the scalar meson @xmath6 becomes massless degenerate with @xmath1 as the chiral partner    i first consider the representations of the following zero helicity ( @xmath7 ) states under @xmath8 ; the @xmath1 , the ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 , the @xmath6 and the ( longitudinal ) axial - vector meson denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath1 and the @xmath9 are admixture of @xmath10 and @xmath11 since the symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite : @xmath12 where the experimental value of the mixing angle @xmath13 is given by approximately @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and the @xmath6 , on the other hand , are expressed as @xmath15    when the chiral symmetry is restored at the phase transition point , it is natural to expect that the chiral representations coincide with the mass eigenstates : the representation mixing is dissolved . from eq .",
    "( [ mix pi a ] ) one can easily see that there are two ways to express the representations in the wigner phase of the chiral symmetry : the conventional gl manifestation corresponds to the limit @xmath16 : @xmath17 on the other hand , the vm corresponds to the limit @xmath18 in which the @xmath9 goes to a pure @xmath19 , now degenerate with the scalar meson @xmath6 in the same representation , but not with @xmath0 in @xmath20 : @xmath21 namely , the degenerate massless @xmath1 and ( longitudinal ) @xmath0 at the phase transition point are the chiral partners in the representation of @xmath20 .",
    "it should be noticed that the critical temperature of the chiral symmetry restoration is approached from the broken phase up to @xmath22 , and that the following basic assumptions are adopted in the analysis : ( 1 ) the relevant degrees of freedom until near @xmath22 are only @xmath1 and @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) other mesons such as @xmath9 and scalar mesons are still heavy at @xmath22 ; ( 3 ) partial chiral symmetry restoration already occurs at @xmath22 .",
    "based on these assumptions , it was shown  @xcite that the vm necessarily occurs at the chiral symmetry restoration point .",
    "one of the most important key ingredients to formulate the vm in hot matter is the _ intrinsic temperature dependences _",
    "@xcite of the parameters determined through the wilsonian matching  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic temperature dependence introduced through the wilsonian matching is nothing but the signature that hadrons have internal structures constructed from the quarks and gluons .",
    "this is similar to the situation where coupling constants among hadrons are replaced with appropriate momentum - dependent form factors in high energy region .",
    "the intrinsic effects play more important roles in higher temperature region , especially near the critical temperature .    when @xmath23 is approached from below , the axial - vector and vector current correlators derived in the ope approach each other for any value of @xmath24 .",
    "thus we require that these current correlators in the hls become close to each other near @xmath23 for any value of @xmath25 .",
    "this requirement implies that the bare @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 these conditions ( `` vm conditions in hot matter '' ) for the bare parameters are converted into the conditions for the on - shell parameters through the wilsonian renormalization group equations ( rges ) . since @xmath29 and @xmath30 are separately the fixed points of the rges for @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite , @xmath31 is satisfied at any energy scale . as a result",
    ", the quantum correction to the @xmath0 mass as well as the hadronic thermal correction disappears at @xmath23 since they are proportional to the gauge coupling @xmath26 .",
    "the bare @xmath0 mass , which is also proportional to @xmath32 , vanishes at @xmath23 .",
    "these imply that the pole mass of the @xmath0 meson also vanishes at @xmath23 : @xmath33",
    "in this write - up , i first showed the difference between the vm and the conventional manifestation of chiral symmetry restoration based on the linear sigma model in terms of the chiral representation of the mesons in section  [ sec : vm ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : vmt ] , i reviewed how to formulate the vm in hot matter .",
    "i would like to note that the vm in dense matter can be formulated in a similar way  @xcite , where the _ intrinsic density dependence _ plays an important role .",
    "there are several predictions of the vm in hot matter made so far : in ref .  ,",
    "the vector and axial - vector susceptibilities were studied .",
    "it was shown that the equality between two susceptibilities are satisfied and that the vm predicts @xmath34 for @xmath35 , which is in good agreement with the result obtained in the lattice simulation  @xcite . in ref .  , a prediction associated with the validity of vector dominance ( vd ) in hot matter was made : as a consequence of including the intrinsic effect , the vd is largely violated at the critical temperature .",
    "the violation of the vd near the critical temperature plays an important role to explain the na60 dimuon data based on the brown - rho scaling  @xcite . in ref .  , the pion velocity @xmath36 was studied including the effect of lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "the prediction for @xmath36 is @xmath37 , which is consistent with @xmath38 of cramer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite extracted from the recent star data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .  , starting with an hls lagrangian at the vm fixed point that incorporates the heavy - quark symmetry and matching the bare theory to qcd , we calculated the splitting of chiral doublers of @xmath39 mesons proposed in refs .",
    "the predicted splitting comes out to be @xmath40gev , which is in good agreement with the experiment  @xcite .",
