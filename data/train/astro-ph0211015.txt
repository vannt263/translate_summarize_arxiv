    "the source exhibits he @xmath34686 emission and p cygni profiles have been detected on balmer and he lines ( e.g.charles et al .  1983 ) .",
    "these spectral features with such high velocity components are not seen in classical be stars .",
    "the system was found to have an orbital period of 16.6515 @xmath0 0.0005  d from the recurrence of its outbursts ( skinner 1981 ; hereafter s81 ) , which are interpreted as arising in a highly eccentric orbit ( charles et al .",
    "1983 ) .    in a previous paper ( alcock et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter paper i ) we analysed 5 years of optical monitoring of  by the macho project .",
    "this revealed a remarkably stable long - term modulation of 420.82 @xmath0 0.79  d , together with the previously known 16.6510 @xmath0 0.0022  d period , hitherto interpreted as being orbital in origin .",
    "a model was presented in paper i in which the origin of the long - term period is due to the formation and depletion of an equatorial disc surrounding the be star . in this model , as the disc forms , the material shrouds the be star and the brightness of the source is reduced , as is observed in the light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ephem ] , top panel ; which is based on fig .  1 of paper i ) .",
    "the neutron star is then able to accrete from the circumstellar matter and outbursts can occur .",
    "the successive neutron star passages deplete the available material and the source is seen to brighten .",
    "once all the material is accreted , or ejected , the source returns to a quiescent state in which the naked be star can be observed .    to investigate the periodicities found in paper i we have analysed archival photometric data of  from s81 . to test our model",
    "we have compared the times of predicted outbursts with observations of  from the literature .",
    "in 1981 skinner analysed archival uk schmidt and harvard photographic _ b_-band plates of , taken between 1915 and 1981 . from these observations he derived the 16.6515  d orbital period , and an ephemeris of t@xmath4 = mjd  2443423.96 , which has been the basis for studies of  over the last 20 years .",
    "our macho observations revealed the presence of the same orbital modulation with a period of 16.6510  d ( see paper i ) , which within errors confirms skinner s orbital period for .",
    "it was noted that the outbursts observed in the macho light curve are much smaller than those found by s81 and densham et al.(1983 ) .",
    "our aim in analysing the archival plate data was to investigate both the presence and stability of this long - term period over the much longer interval ( 70 years ) of the archival plate material .",
    "skinner s data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_lc ] .      to search for the long period found from the macho photometry we first removed the 16.65  d periodic outburst events from the archival plate data . using our _ a priori _ knowledge , we searched for a periodicity near to 420.82  d. we performed the temporal analysis using a phase dispersion minimisation ( pdm ) periodogram ( stellingwerf 1978 ) over the frequency range 2.32x@xmath52.44x@xmath5 cycle d@xmath6 , with a resolution of 1.5x@xmath7 cycle d@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_long_search ] ) .",
    "the lowest peak in the pdm corresponds to p = 421.29  d , which is within the error for the macho period .",
    "we propagated an error for the peak in the pdm periodogram by a monte carlo simulation in which we created artificial light curves with the same mean and standard deviation as the archival light curve .",
    "we calculated pdms for each artificial dataset .",
    "we then employed a centroiding technique in which the mode of the peaks near the peak of interest that are below a user defined threshold is calculated .",
    "we find p = 421.29 @xmath0 0.95  d , which again encompasses the macho period . to assess the significance of this period",
    ", we performed a period search over a longer frequency range , namely 0.0010.01 cycle d@xmath6 , with a resolution of 1x@xmath8 cycle d@xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_longer_search ] ) .",
    "we employed a pdm periodogram and lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) for the temporal analysis .",
    "the results from the longer search indicates that the 421.29  d period is significant .",
    "however , the ls periodogram has many peaks above the 99% confidence level .",
    "we created two simulated light curves using a gaussian random number generator with the same mean and standard deviation as the archival data .",
    "one contained an added sinusoidal signal with a frequency equal to that of the highest peak in the ls periodogram , while the other contained a signal corresponding to 421.29  d. we then constructed a ls periodogram for each simulated light curve , with the same frequency range and resolution as for the longer search .",
    "the peaks present in the ls periodogram for the simulated light curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_longer_search ] , third and fourth panels ) show that the ls periodogram structure in the real data can not distinguish between the presence of one or two periods .",
    "it is also possible that the periodogram can be due to one frequency which shifts slightly over the time span of the dataset .",
    "the latter case is more likely given the nature of the long - term periods in be systems .",
    "hence we find marginal evidence , given the poorer quality of the plate data , for a comparable periodicity to that found in the macho data .",
    "we folded the archival data on p = 421.29  d , using the macho ephemeris t@xmath4 = jd  2449002.109 ( see paper i ) , and then binned the data , to investigate the form of the modulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_long_fold ] ) .",
    "the folded and phase binned light curves indicate that there is a periodic modulation present .",
    "the form of the variability is marginally different to that for the macho data , as the flat section of the folded light curve we obtained for the macho data is not evident ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ephem ] , top panel ) .",
    "however , this may be due to there being a much greater uncertainty in the _ b _ magnitudes determined from the archival plates which leads to a larger scatter in the archival light curve .",
    "we also note that a far greater number of cycles are used to create the folded light curve of the archival data .",
    "we find that the modulation in the macho light curve varies from cycle to cycle , this may also be occurring in the archival data , however the scatter would mask this .",
    "we also investigated whether we could determine an improved orbital period and ephemeris for our combined dataset spanning 83 years , comprising the archival plate data and the macho data .",
    "s81 found an orbital period of 16.6515 @xmath0 0.0005  d for the archival data and we found p = 16.6510 @xmath0 0.0022  d for the macho data . before we could search for a common period we had to detrend the archival data ; as for the macho data , this was achieved by subtracting a third order polynomial from the dataset .",
    "we then combined these data with the detrended macho data ( see paper i ) .    due to the highly non - sinusoidal nature of the outburst modulation seen in both the archival data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pchi_fold ] ) and the macho data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ephem ] ) , a fourier - based period search is not appropriate .",
    "a pdm was performed for a frequency range 0.0550.065 cycle d@xmath6 with a resolution of 8.25x@xmath7 cycle d@xmath6 , the resulting periodogram shows substantial fine structure which makes determining the true period difficult ( fig .",
    "[ fig : skinner_short_search ] ) .",
    "the minimum value in the pdm found using the centroiding technique , with an error propagated with a monte carlo simulation as before , is p = 16.6466 @xmath0 0.0002  d. the value for the period found from the combined archival plate data and the macho data is lower than the periods found for each dataset alone ( see s81 and paper i , respectively ) .",
    "the error found also does not encompass the previous values .",
    "we note that the range of periods investigated in the combined search is narrower and the resolution finer than the previous searches .    to refine this result we attempted a cycle - counting analysis of the outburst timings .",
    "we divided the combined data into 6 sections .",
    "we then took the period given by s81 and folded and phase - binned each section of data on it , using an arbitrary phase zero ( t@xmath4 ) .",
    "the phase of the peak of the outburst ( @xmath9 ) was estimated with an error determined from the other points in the peak .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pchi ] .    the combined data were folded and phase - binned on the best - fit period and ephemeris derived from the cycle counting method ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pchi_fold ] ) .",
    "the value for the best - fit period is again lower than the period found in s81 and paper i.",
    "by studying previous observations of  from the literature we are able to investigate our proposed model for the 421  d cycle .  is known to exhibit recurrent optical and x - ray outbursts on its orbital period . by convention",
    "the source is described as being `` active '' when such outbursts occur ( which coincide with when the source is optically bright ) .",
    "the `` quiescent '' phase is taken to be when no outbursts are detected , coinciding with when the source is optically faint .",
    "many observations of  have been taken near phase zero of the 16.6  d period hoping to detect outbursts , some have been successful , while others not .    in our model  is only in an active state , and hence outbursts can occur , during the extended dip phase in the 421  d cycle , when the system is faint . the brightness of the source decreases due to the formation of the be star s equatorial disc , as the neutron star passes through this disc it accretes material leading to outbursts .",
    "successive orbits of the neutron star depletes the circumstellar matter causing the brightness of the source to increase .  then returns to quiescence",

    "while the source is in quiescence it is seen to be optically bright as we observe only the naked b star . with our model",
    "we can predict times when the source should display outbursts , and when the bare b star can be observed .",
    "it is clear then that the previously used _",
    "active / quiescent _ terminology is too crude to cover the range of behaviour that is observed .",
    "therefore , using our model we have defined the following activity states for the source :    * _ active _ : in the 421  d cycle the source is only active during the extended dip , i.e. @xmath14 = 0.360.94 * _ high _ : in the active state , times of optical / x - ray outburst , or mini - outburst , predicted by the 16.6  d orbital period , i.e. @xmath15 = 0.960.2 * _ low _ : times when outbursts should not be seen in the active state * _ quiescent _ : times when only the naked b star should be seen in the 421  d cycle , i.e. @xmath14 = 0.940.36    fig .",

    "the be star and disc can then be represented simply by a half circle ( for the unobscured hemisphere ) and half an ellipse ( for the obscured hemisphere ) .",
    "the semi - minor axis of the ellipse is related to the inclination angle for the system , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the semi - minor axis of the ellipse , @xmath24 is the radius of the star , and @xmath25 is the inclination .",
    "this assumes that the disc covers all of the star on the obscured hemisphere at radii greater than the semi - minor axis , and that the disc is not emitting any light .",
    "this therefore sets a lower limit for @xmath25 , since if the disc were contributing to the observed magnitude , the inclination would have to be higher to cover more of the star to compensate for the light from the disc .",
