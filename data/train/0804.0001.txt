    "skew scattering , introduced almost 80 years ago @xcite , had recently attracted a lot of interest , since it is a key ingredient of the anomalous hall effect @xcite as well as of the spin - hall effect @xcite .",

    "we , on the other hand , made use of the smallness of the spin - orbit coupling _ at the first step_. this allowed us to obtain closed _ analytical _",
