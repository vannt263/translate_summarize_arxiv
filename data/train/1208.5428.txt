    "energetic heavy - ion collisions are the only way of producing high - density nuclear matter in terrestrial laboratories .",
    "all heavy nuclei are neutron - rich and many of them have a prolate or oblate shape in their ground states . while the role of deformation / orientation of nuclei in nuclear fusion / fission at low energies has been studied extensively for a long time , it is only during the past decade that we witnessed a surge of investigations making good use of the deformation / orientation of heavy nuclei in energetic nuclear reactions to probe interesting physics issues , such as properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite and chiral magnetic effect @xcite in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is exciting to note that u+u experiments at 193 gev / nucleon have been done very recently by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite . while waiting for the experimental results , it is worth mentioning that a very rich array of phenomena were predicted to occur in u+u collisions due to different relative orientations of the football - shaped uranium nuclei . among all possible orientations , the tip - tip ( with long axes head - on ) and body - body ( with short axes head - on and long axes parallel ) collisions are the most interesting ones . in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the central body - body u+u collisions provides a better system to study the properties of formed qgp compared with pb+pb or au+au collisions of similar eccentricity  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the particle multiplicity , initial eccentricity , and final collective flow will be affected by the collision geometry  @xcite . at beam energies of a few hundred mev / nucleon",
    ", tip - tip collisions normally have a larger stopping power and a longer high - density phase compared to body - body collisions  @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that the multiplicities of pions and free nucleons are different in tip - tip collisions and body - body collisions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the transverse flow , which is an observable sensitive to the nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) , is much larger in non - central tip - tip collisions than in non - central body - body collisions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the elliptic flow ( @xmath1 ) , which is another messenger about nucleon - nucleon interactions in dense matter , is different in tip - tip and body - body collisions as well  @xcite . while it is very challenging to select events of special orientations , such as tip - tip and body - body in u+u collisions , several promising triggers",
    "have been proposed in the literature  @xcite and tested positively in model simulations .    generally speaking ,",
    "heavy nuclei are all neutron - rich especially in their surface areas .",
    "moreover , protons and neutrons may have different deformations .",
    "there are considerable interests in the heavy - ion reaction community to carry out u+u collisions at intermediate energies to probe the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy @xmath2 at 1 - 3 times normal nuclear matter density .",
    "for instance , u+u experiments at 0.52 gev / nucleon have already been planned at the external target facility of the cooling storage ring at lanzhou / china  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 at supra - saturation density is among the most uncertain properties of dense neutron - rich matter and has many important ramifications in astrophysics  @xcite . especially , the @xmath2 at 1 - 3 times normal nuclear matter density plays the most important role in determining the radii of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "does the u+u collisions really provide a better opportunity to probe the eos of dense neutron - rich matter than reactions with spherical nuclei of similar masses ?",
    "suppose one can indeed trigger on collisions with specific orientations in u+u collisions , which orientation , tip - tip or body - body , may be a better choice to investigate the @xmath2 at supra - saturation densities ?",
    "for a given orientation , what are the sensitive probes of the @xmath2 ?",
    "on the other hand , suppose one can not distinguish different orientations in u+u collisions in an unfortunate situation , how big are the relative effects of nuclear symmetry energy and nuclear deformation / orientation on isospin - sensitive observables ( isospin tracers ) in inclusive reaction events ? to help answer these questions , we examine relative effects of the collision geometry and nuclear symmetry energy in u+u collisions at 0.52 gev / nucleon .",
    "several @xmath2-sensitive experimental observables in either tip - tip or body - body u+u collisions are identified .",
    "the results are expected to be useful for planning the u+u experiments at intermediate energies .",
    "our study is carried out within the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model  @xcite . to facility discussions of the ibuu results",
    ", we shall firstly describe briefly the effective nuclear interaction used in this study .",
    "the neutron and proton distributions in uranium nuclei are then outlined .",
    "the momentum dependence of the nuclear interaction is important in understanding not only dynamics in intermediate - energy heavy - ion collisions  @xcite but also thermodynamical properties of nuclear matter  @xcite . in the present study we use an isospin- and momentum - dependent interaction  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the mean - field potential of a nucleon with momentum @xmath3 and isospin @xmath4 is written as @xmath5 in the above , @xmath6 is the nucleon number density and @xmath7 is the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear medium , with @xmath8 the neutron ( proton ) density , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) for neutrons ( protons ) , and @xmath11 is the local phase - space distribution function .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and they lead to the binding energy @xmath14 mev and incompressibility @xmath15 mev for symmetric nuclear matter and symmetry energy @xmath16 mev at saturation density @xmath17 @xmath18 .    .",
    "]    the above mean - field potential comes from a modified gogny force including a zero - range effective three - body interaction and a finite - range yukawa - type two - body interaction  @xcite , where the parameter @xmath19 controls the relative contributions of the isosinglet and isotriplet interaction channels . by adjusting the value of @xmath19 ,",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy is modified while the value of the symmetry energy at saturation density and all the properties for symmetric nuclear matter remain unchanged .",
    "the analytical formula of the symmetry energy in this model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . from comparing the ibuu calculations with the isospin diffusion data",
    ", the value of @xmath19 is constrained between @xmath20 and @xmath21 at densities around and below the saturation density of nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding slope parameter @xmath22 is between @xmath23 and @xmath24 mev overlapping with constraints extracted from studying several other observables using various approaches ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at supra - saturation densities , while the fopi @xmath0 ratio data favors ibuu calculations using a super soft symmetry energy with @xmath25  @xcite , the symmetry energy remains rather uncertain and much more studies of additional observables are very much needed . to evaluate the relative effects due to the collision geometry and the symmetry energy on isospin tracers , we use @xmath26 and @xmath21 in the whole density range in the present work .",
    "we emphasize that the current uncertainty range of the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities is much larger than the one considered here  @xcite .",
    "thus , the symmetry energy effects with respect to those due to geometry in u+u collisions studied here should be considered as being rather conservative . as shown in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ eusym ] , @xmath27 leads to a stiffer symmetry energy which is smaller at subsaturation densities and larger at supra - saturation densities compared with @xmath26 .",
    "a stiffer symmetry energy generally leads to a larger isospin fractionation effect , i.e. , a less neutron - rich high - density regime and a more neutron - rich low - density regime , to lower the energy of the whole system compared with a softer symmetry energy .",
    "the mean - field potential from eq .  ( [ mdiu ] ) can be approximately expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the isoscalar mean - field potential , @xmath30 is the symmetry potential , and the @xmath31 sign is for neutrons ( protons ) . the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential at @xmath32 are plotted in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ eusym ] .",
    "it is seen that the symmetry potential is mostly positive , which means that generally neutrons feel a more repulsive potential than protons .",
    "in addition , the symmetry potential is larger for @xmath27 at supra - saturation densities , thus neutrons are more likely to be emitted from while protons are more likely to be trapped in the high - density regime , resulting in a less neutron - rich high - density regime and a more neutron - rich low - density regime , consistent with the above discussion of the isospin fractionation effect .",
    "the decreasing trend of the symmetry potential with increasing momentum is consistent with the energy dependence of the lane potential and leads to larger effective masses of neutrons than protons  @xcite .",
    "the in - medium nucleon - nucleon elastic cross sections are consistently modified from their free - space values according to the in - medium nucleon effective masses  @xcite .",
    "compared to the uniform ellipsoid distribution as used in refs .",
    "@xcite , a deformed woods - saxon distribution is more realistic for uranium nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in addition , various studies  @xcite have shown that neutron skin exists in deformed nuclei as well , and the deformations of neutron and proton distributions are different .",
    "for @xmath33 , we use woods - saxon distributions for neutrons and protons with different radii and deformations @xmath34},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , \\label{rn}\\\\ r_p^\\prime(\\theta ) & = & r_p[1+\\delta_p y_2 ^ 0(\\theta ) ] . \\label{rp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , @xmath36 is the normalization constant , @xmath37 is the spherical harmonics , and @xmath38 fm is the surface diffuseness parameter . in the present work we use @xmath39 fm for neutrons and @xmath40 fm for protons , respectively .",
    "the deformation parameters are @xmath41 for neutrons and @xmath42 for protons , and @xmath43 is approximately satisfied .",
    "let s first have a global picture of the body - body and tip - tip u+u collisions in ibuu transport model , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dencon ] .",
    "initially two uranium nuclei are placed at a distance along the z - axis with different orientations .",
    "as time goes on , collision happens and the central density can reach @xmath44 or higher .",
    "the system is most compressed around 20 fm / c , when the interaction is the strongest and @xmath45 resonances are abundantly produced .",
    "after 20 fm / c the system begins to expand and the density drops .",
    "one can expect the different dynamic processes in body - body and tip - tip u+u collisions from their different density evolutions , especially the longer duration time of the high - density regime in tip - tip collisions .",
    "the neutron - proton differential transverse flow , different elliptic flows of neutrons and protons , pre - equilibrium neutron / proton ratio , and @xmath0 ratio are among the experimental observables known to be sensitive to the @xmath2  @xcite . in the following subsections",
    ", we will examine separately the sensitivity of these observables to the variation of @xmath2 in both tip - tip and body - body collisions at beam energy of 0.52 gev / nucleon .",
    "we will also compare effects of the symmetry energy with those due to the collision geometry .",
    "pre - equilibrium nucleons are identified as those becoming free ( nucleons with local densities @xmath46 ) earlier than @xmath47 fm / c when the participant is well equilibrated .",
    "we found that our conclusions are not sensitive to different criteria of identifying pre - equilibrium nucleons . besides the extreme collision geometries of body - body and tip - tip collisions , as a reference we also study sphere - sphere collisions by setting @xmath48 and @xmath49 in eqs .  ( [ rn ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) .",
    "although it is still very challenging , in the present study we assume that desired reaction orientations can be achieved by either initially polarizing the colliding nuclei or finally selecting special events using orientation triggers proposed in the literature . to simulate typical cases of central and non - central collisions , we generated events with impact parameters @xmath50 fm and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is about @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 fm for tip - tip , sphere - sphere , and body - body collisions , respectively . in each case about @xmath56 events",
    "are generated for analysis .",
    "it is well known that the transverse flow is a useful probe of the nuclear eos .",
    "generally , since the isovector potential is relatively small compared to the isoscalar potential , the transverse flow is dominated by effects of the eos of symmetric nuclear matter and nucleon - nucleon scatterings .",
    "the transverse flow in non - central u+u collisions as a function of reduced rapidity @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the beam rapidity in the center - of - mass frame , is shown in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "similar to the finding in ref .",
    "@xcite , the transverse flow is found to be much larger in tip - tip collisions than in body - body collisions due to the longer duration time of the high - density phase , which leads to a more persisting pressure , and stronger participant squeeze - out and spectator bounce - off effects  @xcite due to the collision geometry in the former case .    to probe the isovector potential and thus the symmetry energy ,",
    "it is more useful to use the neutron - proton differential transverse flow which minimizes effects of the eos of symmetric nuclear matter and nucleon - nucleon scatterings but adds up constructively effects due to the positive and negative symmetry potentials of neutrons and protons , respectively  @xcite . as shown in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ v1 ] , a stiffer symmetry energy ( @xmath27 ) leads to a larger neutron - proton differential flow , reflecting a larger difference of neutron and proton transverse flow .",
    "it is shown that the neutron - proton differential transverse flow is always larger in tip - tip collisions than in body - body collisions , and it is even larger from a soft symmetry energy in tip - tip collisions than that from a stiff symmetry energy in body - body collisions .",
    "thus , effects of the collision geometry on neutron - proton differential transverse flow are much larger than those of the symmetry energy .",
    "the slope parameters @xmath59 in different cases are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , where results from sphere - sphere collisions are also included for comparison .",
    "the slope parameter in tip - tip collisions is more sensitive to the symmetry energy than that in the other two cases , and this is understandable as the total transverse flow in tip - tip collisions is the largest and is most sensitive to the mean - field potential . the neutron - proton differential transverse flow in tip - tip collisions of deformed nuclei is thus a better probe to determine the symmetry energy at supra - saturation densities compared with collisions of spherical nuclei .",

    "we found that the neutron - proton differential transverse flow is always larger in tip - tip than body - body collisions , and it is more sensitive to the symmetry energy in the former case . on the other hand , the difference of neutron and proton elliptic flow is more sensitive to the symmetry energy in body - body than tip - tip collisions .",
