    "there is experimental evidence that turbulent helium ii has a peculiar behavior due to quantum effects at some length scales , while at other length scales it appears similar to classical hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite-@xcite . quantum turbulence is described as a chaotic motion of quantized vortices in a disordered tangle .",
    "the measurements of vortex lines are described in terms of a macroscopic average of the vortex line length per unit volume @xmath0 ( briefly called _ vortex line density _ and which has dimensions @xmath3 ) .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath0 under constant values of the counterflow velocity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 being the velocities of the normal and superfluid components ) and in absence of rotation was formulated by vinen .",
    "neglecting the influence of the walls , such an equation is @xcite :    [ vin ] = v l^3/2 - l^2 , with @xmath8 , @xmath9 the quantum of vorticity ( @xmath10 the mass of the @xmath11he atom and @xmath12 planck s constant , @xmath13 10@xmath14cm@xmath2/s ) and @xmath16 and @xmath17 dimensionless parameters .",
    "note however that another version of ( [ vin ] ) is the so - called alternative vinen s equation , which is also admissible on dimensional grounds",

    "therefore , the difference between ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) must be searched in the dynamical aspects .",
    "this was carried out by vinen himself ( see sections 6 and 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and in more detail by nemirovskii _",
    "@xcite without arriving to definite conclusions , because the predictions of ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) in the domain of available experimental results are very similar to each other .    here we will look for a more general situation where the difference between ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) becomes enhanced .",
    "essentially , equations ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) may be obtained from a microscopic approach based on vortex dynamics , though the derivation of the first one is more direct and straightforward than the other . before proceeding ,",
    "let us briefly recall that from a microscopic approach based on vortex dynamics the production term may be shown to be proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the intervortex spacing @xcite . since the latter is of the form @xmath24 , the form @xmath25 adopted in ( [ vin ] ) follows in an immediate way .",
    "however , it has been also argued that @xcite , since in the steady state @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath27 , one could also write @xmath23 as inversely proportional to @xmath27 , in which case one would have for the production term the alternative form @xmath28 adopted in ( [ vin - al ] ) . the equation ( [ vin - al ] ) was also derived by lipniacki ( pag .",

    "@xcite ) through an alternative microscopic approach , which is referred to the reconnections of vortex lines .    let us say , in support of the form @xmath28 , that though it is less natural from a kinematical point of view , it is rather natural from an energetic point of view , if one assumes in agreement with the microscopical model@xmath29 that the friction force between the normal fluid and the vortex tangle is proportional to @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", the power delivered to the tangle per unit volume would be proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "since the energy density of the tangle is proportional to @xmath0 , the production contribution to @xmath31 would be proportional to the power delivered to the tangle , i.e. to @xmath28 .",
    "another motivation in support of ( [ vin - al ] ) is that it is closer to the phenomenological theory of classical turbulence @xcite than equation ( [ vin ] ) .",
    "indeed , by assuming that turbulence can be characterized by the line density @xmath0 and that its derivative @xmath31 is an analytic function of @xmath0 , the relation @xmath32 can be interpreted as the first term in a series expansion . however , equation ( [ vin ] ) has been much more used than equation ( [ vin - al ] ) .",
    "both ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) are particular cases of :    [ vin2 ] = a_nl^2()^n - l^2 , in fact for @xmath33 one obtains ( [ vin ] ) , for @xmath34 one has ( 1.2 ) , and the cases @xmath35 could correspond to fractal ( intermittent ) turbulence @xcite-@xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been growing attention in superfluid turbulence in rotating containers @xcite-@xcite , in which the formation of vortex lines is due both to the counterflow and the rotation , which has fostered the extension of vinen s ideas to a wider range of situations @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a phenomenological generalization of vinen s equation ( 1.1 ) has been proposed for the evolution of @xmath0 in the simultaneous presence of @xmath4 and @xmath36 ( @xmath36 being the angular velocity of the container ) . a thermodynamic analysis to determine possible coupling terms between the evolution equations of @xmath0 and",

    "the extension of the form ( [ vin - al ] ) of vinen s equation to rotating counterflow turbulence will be studied in order to explore whether this more general situation may provide further arguments to decide which of both starting equations , ( [ vin ] ) or ( [ vin - al ] ) , is more suitable to describe actual experimental results .",
    "of course , the final version will be fully satisfactory only when the macroscopic expression will be understood from a microscopical basis , and the respective coefficients of all terms will be microscopically calculated and found to coincide with macroscopic observations . however , this situation is still far ahead of our present abilities , because of the difficulties in modeling  in a statistically significative way  a system of vortices under rotation .",
    "thus , a combined effort in macroscopic and microscopic perspectives seems a reasonable and promising way to proceed .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section 2 a new equation for the evolution of @xmath0 in counterflow in rotating containers",
    "is written , through a modification of the vinen s alternative equation , and it is solved in steady and unsteady situations in order to compare it with the generalization of the usual vinen s one made in ref .  @xcite . in section 3 a thermodynamic analysis of counterflow rotational superfluid turbulence",
    "is performed , according to the formalism of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , to obtain the general form of the friction exerted by the tangle on the motion of the fluid .",
    "there are not many experiments on counterflow in rotating containers . in the work of swanson _",
    "@xcite , the counterflow velocity @xmath27 was parallel to the rotation axis and the experimental observations consisted in measuring the attenuation of second sound , when it is propagated orthogonal to the rotation axis .",
    "they interpreted their results as measurements of the vortex line density @xmath0 , and compared the observed line density with what would be expected if the two sources of vorticity ( rotation and counterflow ) simply added .",
    "their results showed an interesting interplay between the ordered vortices of rotation and the disordered ones of counterflow .",
    "they found a critical counterflow velocity which marks the transition to a disordered turbulent tangle . in the limit of high rotation",
    "this critical velocity appears proportional to @xmath37 .",
    "another experiment is that carried out by yarmchuck and glaberson @xcite , in which a pair of horizontal parallel glass plates are arranged to form a large aspect ratio channel closed at one end with a heater nearby , and open at the other end to the liquid helium bath .",
    "the channel is rotated about a vertical axis orthogonal to the heat flux . in this way",
    "the counterflow velocity @xmath4 is orthogonal to angular velocity @xmath36 . by determining gradient of temperature and chemical potential as functions of @xmath27 and @xmath38",
    ", they found a linear regime , in which these gradients grow proportionally to the rotation speed , and a critical counterflow velocity associated with the onset of turbulent regime , which increases as @xmath39 when @xmath38 gets large .",
    "the mentioned experiments by swanson , barenghi and donnelly @xcite and by yarmchuck and glaberson @xcite show that , when the heat flux and the rotation are simultaneously present , there appears a complex interaction between both processes in the formation and destruction of vortices . in the experiment performed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath36 and @xmath4 collinear ) , they observed that the effects of @xmath27 and @xmath38 are not additive : in fact , for low values of @xmath38 , the laminar regime ( vortex - free regime ) is absent and the total vortex line density is higher than @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 being the values of @xmath0 in steady rotation and in steady counterflow superfluid turbulence respectively :    [ lrlh ] l = l_r=2,0.5 in l_h= ^2 , with @xmath21 a dimensionless coefficient while , for higher values of @xmath38 and @xmath27 , the measured values of @xmath0 are always less than @xmath43 , and the deviation increases with @xmath27 and @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the rotation facilitates the vortex formation , in the absence or for small counterflow velocities , but it hinders their lengthening for high values of @xmath27 and @xmath38 .    for fast enough rotation , there are two critical counterflow - rotation velocities @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which scale as @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 cm  sec@xmath50 , @xmath51 cm  sec@xmath50 ) . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the length @xmath0 per unit volume of the vortex lines is independent of @xmath27 and agrees with the first expression in ( [ lrlh ] ) . for @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath0 is still independent of @xmath27 and proportional to @xmath38 , with a slightly different proportionality constant than in the previous situation ; finally , for @xmath54 , @xmath0 increases and becomes proportional to @xmath55 at high values of @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite interpreted the first transition as the donnelly - glaberson instability ccd , og : excitation of helical waves ( kelvin waves ) by the counterflow on the vortex lines induced by rotation , and the second as a transition to a turbulent disordered tangle .",
    "@xcite also have paid attention to this experiment .",
    "they proposed that the regime @xmath56 is a state of polarized turbulence , while for @xmath57 the polarization is decreased by the large number of reconnections .    in the regime of high rotation ( @xmath58 hz @xmath59 hz and @xmath60 cm@xmath2/s@xmath2 ) and @xmath61 parallel to @xmath4 , equation ( [ vin ] ) has been generalized to incorporate the presence of rotation , as @xcite :    [ vinequa22 ] dldt= -l^2 + _",

    "note that , as production terms in eq .",
    "( [ vinequa22 ] ) a term in @xmath27 and a term in @xmath46 were used ; this was motivated by the dependence of the steady - state values of @xmath26 , in counterflow only and in rotation only , on @xmath27 and on @xmath46 ( see equations ( [ lrlh ] ) ) , and by the observation that the microscopic mechanism responsible for the growth of vortices ( the mutual friction force ) is the same in rotating helium ii and in superfluid turbulence .",
    "there are present three destruction contributions : a term @xmath70 independent on @xmath71 and on @xmath38 , present also in ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) ( this term , responsible for the vortex decay in pure counterflow , was determined by vinen in analogy with classical turbulence ) and the two terms @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which take account of the interactions between counterflow and rotation , reducing the length of the vortices ; a term quadratic in @xmath27 was neglected , because the values of @xmath27 used in the experiments by swanson _",
    "et al . _ were not very high .",
    "( [ vinequa22 ] ) describes , in good agreement with experimental results , some of the most relevant effects observed in the experiments of ref .",
    "however , as we have mentioned in the introduction , the alternative vinen s equation also describes well the experimental results in pure counterflow and therefore it is natural to ask how does it work when extended to incorporate rotation .    here , we suggest a new evolution equation for the evolution of vortex line density @xmath0 in rotating counterflow , starting from the alternative vinen s equation and following the lines of thought outlined in ref .",
    "we consider the case in which @xmath27 and @xmath38 are parallel to each other .",
    "the proposed new equation , reducing to ( 1.2 ) for vanishing rotation , is : [ altvinequa ] dldt = -l^2 + a_1 + b_1 , where the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 depend on the polarization of the tangle , which was supposed function of @xmath38 and @xmath27 .",
    "we outline now a possible physical interpretation for the terms of production and destruction of vortices introduced in this equation .",
    "the two production terms , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , indicate that both rotation and counterflow favor the vortex formation : the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be interpreted as the characteristic times for the formation of vortex lines due to the counterflow and to the rotation , respectively . as in ( [ vinequa22 ] )",
    ", three destruction terms are present .",
    "the term @xmath82 describes the complex interaction between rotation  which tends to straighten out the otherwise irregular vortex lines of the tangle , thus shortening them and reducing @xmath0  and counterflow , which randomize them .",
    "another aspect especially worth of comment is the meaning of the two destruction terms , independent on @xmath27 , @xmath83 and @xmath70 .",
    "one could argue , indeed , that at steady pure rotation there is no vortex destruction .",
    "thus , in purely rotation situations the vortices are usually produced on the walls and they migrate to the bulk of the fluid in the cylinder ; in this case , these terms would represent a repulsion force between parallel vortices , putting an upper limit to the possible number of straight vortices in the vortex array .    in a general situation",
    ", these two destruction terms will incorporate real destruction of vortices due to breaking recombination of nonparallel vortices , and to repulsion between parallel segments of vortices in the presence of rotation .",
    "the superposition of these two different effects is one of the reasons that the coefficients in the terms in @xmath84 and in @xmath85 depend on the polarization of the tangle .",
    "the destruction term @xmath70 , which appears also in ( [ vin ] ) , ( [ vin - al ] ) and ( [ vinequa22 ] ) , is not modified , in agreement with recent studies which show that the decay of the turbulence , in the absence of rotation and counterflow velocity , is analogous to that of classical turbulence @xcite .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the simplicity of ( [ vinequa22 ] ) as ( [ altvinequa ] ) is a little bit deceptive , because the coefficients appearing in it depend on the polarity and the anisotropy of the vortex tangle , which are taken as independent variables in the more detailed approach proposed in the recent paper @xcite . of course",
    ", this difficulty arises not only in the macroscopic approach , but also in the microscopic approaches .",
    "since the coefficients appearing in ( [ altvinequa ] ) depend on the anisotropy and on the polarization of the tangle , they have to depend on the angular velocity @xmath38 and on the counterflow velocity @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath86 eq .",
    "( [ altvinequa ] ) reduces to ( 1.2 ) , and the coefficient @xmath87 assumes the value : [ a1 ] = 0.156.in the analysis carried out in the present paper , the dependence of the coefficients on the polarity plays not an important role , because in section  2.2 we are comparing two equations in a regime of values of @xmath27 and @xmath38 ( @xmath58 hz @xmath88 hz",
    "and @xmath60 cm@xmath2/s@xmath2 ) with approximately the same polarity , and in section  2.4 we compare the non - stationary behavior of the perturbations to a given physical situation , as described by two different equations .    in the successive subsections we solve equation ( [ altvinequa ] ) in steady and unsteady situations and",
    "we show that it allows us to account for the experiments described in ref .",
    "@xcite and we compare the results with the description pointed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the extension of ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the non zero stationary solutions of ( [ altvinequa ] ) are solutions of the following second - order algebraic equation in the unknown @xmath0 :    [ algequa ] l^2 - l + = 0 , where we have put @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "looking at the experimental results of ref .",

    "we will concentrate on the change near @xmath45 .",
    "reasoning as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we observe that , under the hypothesis :    = b_3a_1(b_1- b_3a_1 ) , it follows that :    = _ 1 ^ 2 _ 1-_2 , 0.4 in b_2=",
    "_ 1 ^ 2 _ 2_1-_2 , and the solutions of equation ( [ algequa ] ) can be written :    [ solstazl1 ] l = l_1^a=_1 , [ solstazl2 ] l = l_2^a= a_1 v^2 ^ 2+(b_1 -_1 )",
    ".    in the plane @xmath92 , ( [ solstazl1 ] ) and ( [ solstazl2 ] ) represent two families of straight lines plotted in fig .",
    "[ confronto ] , the first of them ( equation ( [ solstazl1 ] ) ) parallel to the @xmath55 axis and the second one ( equation ( [ solstazl2 ] ) ) with a slope independent of @xmath38 .",
    "a linear stability analysis of these solutions shows that the solution ( [ solstazl1 ] ) is stable if @xmath27 is lower than :    [ velocrit2 ] v_c2 ^ 2=a_1 = a_1 _ 1 ^ 2 - 2_1_2 _ 1-_2 , ( corresponding to the point of interception of the two straight lines ( [ solstazl1 ] ) and ( [ solstazl2 ] ) ) , while , for values of @xmath27 higher than @xmath45 , the solution ( [ solstazl2 ] ) is stable .",
    "therefore @xmath45 represents the second critical counterflow - rotation velocity observed in the experiments of ref .",
    "as we see , this critical velocity scales as @xmath93 , in agreement with experimental observations .",
    "the experimental data on the steady states of @xmath0 allow us to determine the values assumed by the dimensionless quantities appearing in equation ( [ altvinequa ] ) .",

    "the situation has been compared by donnelly to magnetic systems , where the external field @xmath128 contributes to the orientation of magnetic dipoles , while the temperature @xmath129 has a disordering effect .",
    "thus , the `` @xmath130 '' term in ( [ espreni1 ] ) is analogous to the expression describing magnetization in terms of magnetic field and temperature in a @xmath131 spin paramagnetic system .",
    "other expressions , as for instance , langevin s one for classical paramagnetism , could also be used @xcite .",

    "@xcite , to explain the transition from the laminar to the turbulent regime in pure counterflow , and is based on an analogous physical basis : there , the flow was producing the helicoidal excitation waves along the vortices pinned to the walls of the container always present in the laminar regime .",
    "we recall that in pure counterflow , in containers with circular and square section , there are three different regimes distinguished by two critical counterflow velocities : under the first critical velocity we have the laminar regime where only a few of vortices pinned to the walls of the containers are present , between the two critical velocities a state of low vortex line density ( ti regime ) is formed , and , at last , above the second critical velocity a state of higher values of @xmath0 ( tii regime ) is present . in ref .",
    "@xcite the transition from the laminar regime to the turbulent ti regime was explained supposing that small localized arrays of quantized vortices appear when the counterflow velocity reaches the first critical velocity , because kelvin waves may be propagated in these pinned vortices . whereas , when the counterflow reaches the second critical velocity , the ti turbulent regime , which is an inhomogeneous and locally polarized state , becomes unstable , with a transition to an homogeneous slightly not isotropic state tii .",
    "in the microscopic model we have commented on , the second critical velocity @xmath45 is interpreted as the velocity where the helical vortex lines produced in @xmath44 have reached an amplitude of the order of the average vortex separation and have broken and reconnected , and form a disordered tangle .",

    "though the lack of experiments about the evolution of the vortex line density @xmath0 in this more general case ( rotation and counterflow ) does not allow us to compare directly our results with experimental data , however we can arrive at some interesting conclusions concerning the difference of behavior .",
    "first of all , we have to state that the analysis below refers to @xmath0 as dependent variable when the growth of @xmath27 or of @xmath38 is very small .",
    "two main situations are considered , in the first one the angular velocity is fixed and the counterflow velocity moves between two consecutive experimental values ( see fig .  [ confronto ] ) ; in the second one the opposite situation is assumed , that is @xmath27 is fixed and @xmath38 grows in a small range .",
    "this choice is due to the fact that when the ranges of @xmath27 and @xmath38 are sufficiently large , the coefficients of the vinen s equations may be not constant , as showed by schwarz and rozen in ref .",
    "@xcite , because they may depend on the anisotropy and polarization of the tangle .",

    "fixed*. now , we choose some values for @xmath55 and @xmath38 in order to plot the solutions of the two models .",
    "first of all we consider the case @xmath136 , and in particular the values @xmath137 and @xmath138 to which the following values of the stationary solutions correspond :    @xmath139 for the initial value @xmath132 we choose @xmath140 . here , all the values for @xmath0 , @xmath55 and @xmath38 will be expressed in @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively .    from the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite we already know that in this range the stationary solution @xmath134 is stable .",
    "the same conclusion is reached by looking at the plot of the non - stationary solutions ( [ solnonstalt ] ) and ( [ solnonst ] ) of the two models in fig .  [ lowervc2 ] .",
    "further , we note that the values of @xmath100 and @xmath95 are smaller than @xmath134 and that the non - stationary solutions approach to the stable stationary one , @xmath134 , in relatively similar times .    following the same process as above and setting the same value for @xmath38 and a value @xmath144",
    "slightly higher than @xmath145 , we find the following values for the stationary solutions :    @xmath146 and for @xmath132 two different values @xmath147 and @xmath148 are chosen respectively for the two solutions ( [ solnonstalt ] ) and ( [ solnonst ] ) ( see fig . [ abovevc212 ] ) ) .",
    "note that in this case the value of @xmath134 is smaller than @xmath100 and @xmath95 . as we know from previous studies , in this range the stationary solutions @xmath100 and @xmath95 for the vinen s equation and alternative vinen s one are stable .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ abovevc212 ] , where ( [ solnonstalt ] ) and ( [ solnonst ] ) are plotted .    in fig .",
    "[ abovevc212 ] we also note a different behavior with respect to that in fig .  [ lowervc2 ] ; in fact , the two non - stationary solutions @xmath0 approach the corresponding stationary values @xmath95 and @xmath100 in rather different times with a ratio of about 1:3 , respectively .",
    "so , the solution of the alternative vinen s equation is faster than that of the vinen s equation .",
    "furthermore , if we plot the non - stationary solutions for a value of @xmath55 much higher than @xmath145 , we note that the ratio between the temporal scales is yet bigger than the factor 3 .",
    "in fact , by setting the same value of @xmath38 and taking @xmath149 , the corresponding values of the stationary solutions become : @xmath150 and the graphics of the solutions ( [ solnonstalt ] ) and ( [ solnonst ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ abovevc222 ] . as initial data ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath151 and @xmath152 for the vinen s equation and alternative vinen s one , respectively .",
    "looking at these unsteady solutions , we note that the solution of the alternative vinen s equation approaches to @xmath95 in a much shorter time than the other solution requires to approach @xmath100 , by a ratio of about 1:5 .",
    "note that the time scales in fig .",
    "[ abovevc212 ] [ 100300 seconds ] are much longer than those in fig .",
    "[ abovevc222 ] [ 1575 seconds ] .",
    "this is not surprising because fig .",
    "[ abovevc212 ] corresponds to a situation which is much closer to the critical velocity @xmath45 than that corresponding to fig .",
    "[ abovevc222 ] .",
    "indeed , it is known that the dynamics near critical points and phase transitions is much slower than in situations far from them .    * for @xmath27 fixed*. in the three situation considered before , the angular velocity is always constant ( @xmath138 ) whereas the counterflow velocity increase from an initial value @xmath153 to a final one @xmath27 .",
    "the global behavior is the same when we suppose the opposite situation , that is the counterflow velocity is maintained constant and the angular velocity increases from an initial value @xmath154 to a final one @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , by choosing the counterflow velocity @xmath155 and increasing @xmath38 from @xmath156 to @xmath157 the following values for the stationary solutions are obtained : @xmath158 for @xmath132 the value of @xmath134 at @xmath156 is chosen .",
    "the plots of the unsteady solutions with the previous values is shown in fig .",
    "[ lowervc2-vcost ] , from which the same conclusion of fig .  [ lowervc2 ] may be reached .    in fig .",
    "[ abovevc2-vcost2 ] the two non - stationary solutions ( [ solnonstalt ] ) and ( [ solnonst ] ) are shown when @xmath159 and @xmath38 increases from @xmath156 to @xmath160 . there , by choosing the initial states @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the two solutions @xmath0 approach to the steady states @xmath100 and @xmath95 : @xmath163 in different times , in agreement with the previous situations .",
    "the possibility of at least two reasonable evolution equations for the vortex line density @xmath0 , namely ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) , was known since the early days in which vinen proposed them . however , detailed comparisons for them are very scarce @xcite .",
    "this was due , in part , to the fact that both of them lead to the same form for the steady state results , namely @xmath164 , and that their unsteady solutions are not sufficiently different to reach a definitive conclusion on their relative merit . here",
    ", we have carried out a detailed comparison of an extension of both equations ( [ vin ] ) and ( [ vin - al ] ) to the simultaneous presence of counterflow and rotation .",
    "the extension of ( [ vin ] ) was already studied in ref .",
    "here we have studied the analogous extension of ( [ vin - al ] ) .",
    "we have seen that in steady states the solutions of both equations , namely ( [ solstazl1avalue ] ) and ( [ solstazl1value ] ) have a different form but in the range of available experimental results both of them yield a satisfactory approximate description of the experimental data .",
    "however , a deeper comparison of the experimental errors , in ( [ error1 ] ) and ( [ error2 ] ) , shows that the description based on the alternative vinen s equation is slightly better than the one based on the most well - known vinen s equation .",
    "a new aspect we have explored is the unsteady behavior of the solutions of these equations . here , both equations exhibit remarkable differences , and we show that the solutions of the alternative vinen s tend much faster to their steady - state values .",
    "in fact , this difference depends on the value of the counterflow velocity . for @xmath144 ,",
    "slightly higher than the critical velocity @xmath145 , the time required to reach the steady state solutions is 3 times shorter in the alternative vinen s equation than in the usual vinen s equation , whereas for @xmath149 the difference is still more remarkable , the time scale of the alternative vinen s equation being 5 times shorter than that for the usual one . though we lack detailed experimental data on this unsteady behavior , we know that the time required to reach the steady state was less than 10 minutes according to swanson _ et al . _",
    ", when the counterflow velocity @xmath27 is slightly above the critical velocity @xmath45 and it increases between two consecutive experimental values ( see pag .",
    "191 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . according to the results of the fig .",
    "[ abovevc212 ] , the temporal scale of the solution of the usual vinen s equation is closer to the observations than the temporal scale corresponding to the alternative equation , which tends too fast to the final result .",
    "thus , it seems that the usual equation is preferable on these grounds .",
    "however , it must be stressed that the value of @xmath17 used in our analysis has been @xmath165 , the value corresponding to pure counterflow , but the value of @xmath17 could depend on the polarity of the tangle , as mentioned below expressions ( [ valuealtri ] ) .",
    "the temporal scale of the solution of the generalized usual vinen s equation could be set equal to the experimental value by setting @xmath166 ; instead , to adjust the temporal behaviour of the generalized alternative vinen s equation a much more radical change in the value of @xmath17 should be made , setting @xmath167 .",
    "however , such a drastic reduction of the value of @xmath17 seems at odds with the fact that @xmath87 in the presence of rotation is smaller than in pure counterflow , as mentioned below ( [ valuealtri ] ) .",
    "thus , the dynamical behavior of the usual vinen s production terms seems more suitable than the modified one .",
    "our work makes also evident the need of more detailed studies of the dependence of @xmath17  and other coefficients  on the polarization of the tangle .",
