    "entanglement transfer between qubits and continuous - variable systems is an key step in constructing quantum network .",
    "there are several proposals to construct a quantum network @xcite . in kraus kraus",
    "recent scheme , quantum network can be established by using photons to entangle atoms which are located at different nodes for storing quantum information . under two - mode squeezed vacuum environment , the entanglement of two - mode squeezed light is transferred into atoms .",
    "most recently , leelee put forward a proposal reversely , which use continuous - variable state to store memory .",
    "this scheme has its advantages .",
    "because of the infinite dimensions of their hilbert space , it is believed that multidimensional state can store entanglement memory much more than one ebit @xcite . in the two ways of quantum network ,",
    "high efficiency transfer between qubits and continuous - variable state are both important .",
    "therefore , a lot of efforts have been devoted to enhance dynamic entanglement transfer efficiency@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "serafini @xcitepresented strategies to enhance the dynamic entanglement transfer from continuous - variable to finite - dimensional systems by employing multiple qubits .",
    "paternostro@xcite showed how the quantum correlations initially present in the driving field play a critical role in the entanglement transfer from gaussian state to qubit .",
    "zou @xcite studied the possibility of entangling two separable and mixed qubits by local interaction with the two - mode nonclassical field state .    in this paper ,",
    "we introduce two classical fields to drive two atoms .",
    "it is found that the entanglement of two atoms can be transferred into entangled coherent state with one hundred percent efficiency .",
    "we also can retrieve the  entanglement from the continuous -variable state to the atomic qubits with maximum entanglement . via postselection measure , atomic entangled state and entangled coherent",
    "state can be mutual transformed completely .",
    "the scheme can be realized in cavity qed system .",
    "we assume that the quantum network is established by using two entangled atoms to deposit information in their cavities or two non - entangled atoms to retrive information from the two entangled cavity fields .",
    "we  consider that two identical atoms interact with two separate cavities @xmath0 and @xmath1 while the two atoms are driven by two classical fields . in the hilbert space @xmath2 , the hamiltonian of the total system is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the rabi frequency of two classical fields , and @xmath5 is the coupling between the cavities and the atoms . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the annihilation and creation operators for the two cavities , respectively . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are transition operators of the two atoms where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the excited and ground states of the atoms . because usually the classical field is very stronger than the quantum field , we will take classical field as main part and take the quantum field as perturbed term .",
    "this strategy has been used in @xcite . in order to to perform a unitary transformation easily , we sort the hamiltonian as @xmath12@xmath13changing the atomic bare - state basis into dressed - state basis , i.e. , @xmath14and performing the unitary transform @xmath15 on @xmath16 , in strong driving regime @xmath17 , we can realize a rotating - wave approximation and eliminate high frequency term as it was done in @xcite .",
    "after the transformation , in the new hilbert space @xmath18 , the effective hamiltonian is @xmath19 in next section , we will use the effective hamiltonian to calculate the entanglement transfer .",
    "we assume that initial state of the two cavities are both in vacuum state while the two atoms are in maximal entangled state , that is , the initial state of the system is as @xmath20now , we want to deposit the atomic entangled information into the field state and let the two entangled atoms enter into their cavities separately . the evolution of the system state under the hamiltonian eq.(5 )",
    "can be deduced as @xmath21where @xmath22 .",
    "note that here @xmath23 in eq.(7 ) is not normalized state .",
    "we change the atomic basis into the bare atomic basis @xmath24 and inverse the unitary transformation .",
    "thus , the state of the system in the space @xmath2 can be rewritten as @xmath25 ,   \\label{eq.8}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath26 .",
    "the state in eq.(8 ) is still not normalized . when the atoms come out from the two cavities , we use level - selective ionizing counter and detect the atomic state .",
    "if the internal state of atoms are detected at any of the states @xmath27 the state of the two - cavity fields are projected into    @xmath28 , \\label{9}\\ ] ]    where@xmath29 . \\label{10}\\]]here",
    "the state in eq.(9 ) is normalized .",
    "one can see that the atomic entangled state is completely transferred into the two cavity entangled coherent state if the state in eq.(9 ) state is a maximal entangled one .",
    "we recall that the concurrence of state can be used to estimate the entanglement for such a state @xcite .",
    "the concurrencewooters of a state is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath32 and @xmath33 is pauli matrix .",
    "the concurrence of the state generated from our system ( eq.(9 ) ) is @xmath34[(1-\\exp ( -4|\\alpha _ { 2}|^{2})]}% } { 1\\pm \\cos 2ut\\exp ( -2|\\alpha _ { 1}|^{2}-2|\\alpha _ { 2}|^{2 } ) }   \\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    , @xmath35.,width=264,height=188 ]    where @xmath36 correspond to @xmath36 in eq.(9 ) . due to the factor @xmath37 ,",
    "the entanglement of state eq.(9 ) is different with the state @xmath38 @xcite@xcite even when @xmath39 . in their case",
    ", @xmath40 is exact one ebit and its entanglement is always 1 while @xmath41 is maximum state only when @xmath42 . in our case , we find there is little difference between the two state . if we see the state in space @xmath18 our state",
    "is exact the same with theirs .",
    "when we measure entanglement in space @xmath43 , we need to use the form of eq.(9 ) . its concurrence is show in fig.1 where we choose negative in eq.(11 ) and all the parameters are dimensionless .",
    "fig.1 show that concurrence exhibits a rapid oscillation during a section of starting time which results from the classical field oscillation .",
    "after the time evolution section , concurrence achieves its maximum value 1 and the state is a maximum entangled state .",
    "this is because the quantity of @xmath44 is increased with time @xmath45 evolution .",
    "if the quantity of @xmath46 is large enough , @xmath47 @xmath48 , concurrence in eq.(11 ) will be maximum value 1 and the state of eq.(9 ) will be a ebit state . thus with time evolution , the two - mode field will be a maximum entangled state so that the entanglement in qubit is completely transferred into two - mode fields state .",
    "we have transferred a maximal entanglement to a two - cavity fields completely .",
    "next , we will retrieve the deposit entangled information from two - cavity fields , that is , entanglement transfer from two -cavity fields to atomic state .",
    "we assume the two - cavity fields now are entangled coherent state with eq.(9 ) form which is produced by the above procedure . now",
    "the two atoms in their ground state @xmath49 enter into their cavity separately .",
    "so , in space @xmath2 the initial state of the system is @xmath50|gg\\rangle .",
    "\\label{eq.12}\\]]where @xmath22 is a pure complex number which is exact what we deposit during the process of transfer from qubit to fields .",
    "the state evolution of the system still obey@xmath51the evolution will give us state in space @xmath2 .",
    "we assume @xmath52 , which means we will use the same time to retrieve it back when we use time @xmath53 to deposit it in two - cavity fields .",
    "this strategy had been used in lee .",
    "the condition unitary evolution operator now is @xmath54 .",
    "consider the values of @xmath46 is pure complex number , after some calculation , we obtain the state of the system at evolution time @xmath55 as    @xmath56    substitute @xmath22 and @xmath57 into eq.(14 ) and rewrite the state as @xmath58    in order to improve the degree of entanglement transfer to the atoms , postselection measure on the fields is needed .",
    "this procedure is similar to what we have detected on the atomic state so as to get a pure two  cavity fields .",
    "here , one can see clearly from eq.(15 ) that we will have seven different kinds of cavity fields .",
    "if we project the two - cavity fields with @xmath59 @xmath60means we detect the cavity fields as @xmath61 , the measure on fields results in the atomic state as @xmath62where@xmath63on the bare atomic basis , the state is @xmath64where @xmath65     we need use corresponding time to retrive it .",
    "the parameters are @xmath66 , @xmath67 . ,",
    "width=264,height=188 ]    we still use the concurrence to estimate the entanglement eq.(18 ) state .",
    "the concurrence of the state is @xmath68with @xmath69 .",
    "the atomic entanglement is shown in fig.2 .",
    "one still can see the oscillation resulting from classical field @xmath70 and @xmath71 . excepting short time section",
    ", the entanglement will be maximum value when time @xmath45 is longer .",
    "we can understand it from the analytic expression eqs .",
    "( 17)-(19 ) . if @xmath72 and large @xmath45 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76 . for positive case ,",
    "the atomic state is @xmath77 which is a always maximal entanglement state . by choosing @xmath78 or @xmath79",
    ", one can obtain bell state @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "although during short time section , concurrence is not the maximum value .",
    "but it does not mean  the entanglement can not be completely transferred .",
    "notice fig.1 short time section , the amplitude of the fields during this interval is small and the entanglement do not achieve its maximum value .",
    "so , we can not retrieve a maximum entanglement if the two - mode fields do not achieve its maximal entanglement .",
    "it is easy to see from eq.(15 ) that the probability of this projection is 25% .      except the projection of @xmath59 , we still have other six projections .",
    "if project the two - cavity fields with @xmath83 @xmath60means we detect the cavity fields as @xmath84 , we have @xmath85    for this case , the entanglement transferred is shown in fig .",
    "4 line a. during short evolution time , we can obtain a little entanglement . for large time @xmath45 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath88 is a direct product state for positive case .",
    "we fail to transfer entanglement .",
    "what we get is just to pumping the atomic state from @xmath11 to superposition @xmath89 and obtain larger amplitude of the field @xmath90(first transformation the amplitude is ( @xmath91 ) . if project the two - mode fields with @xmath92 , the atomic entanglement behavior is almost the same .",
    ", @xmath93 , respectively.the parameters are the same with fig .",
    "2.,width=283,height=188 ]    with the projection @xmath94 , we have@xmath95the transferred entanglement is plotted in fig.3 line b. at this case , because the cavity mode 2 is projected with vacuum state ( inverse the mode ) , so the entanglement in short time evolution is larger than line a. but , for large time @xmath45 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the atomic state is still a product one @xmath98 .",
    "similarly , we can easy analyze the remaining projection @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "their behaviors are like the case with the projection @xmath101    up to now , we have analyzed all kinds of projections .",
    "we conclude that with the projection @xmath59 , we can completely transfer two - cavity entangled coherent state into atomic state .",
    "we can understand it from the reversible property of quantum mechanics .",
    "we produce entangled coherent state from atomic entanglement and vacuum cavity mode .",
    "projection with @xmath59 means keeping the two - mode still in vacuum state ; in this way the first process is reversed and entanglement will be retrieved back into atomic state .",
    "other projections can not make the two - cavity state in its original one so that entanglement can not be retrieved completely .",
    "we have considered entanglement transfer between atomic state and two - mode cavity state . by introducing two - mode classical fields , entanglement can be transferred reciprocally . before our proposal",

    "serafini serafini put forward a strategy by using multiple qubits ( atomic cloud ) .",

    "because the entanglement measurement of two - cavity entangled coherent state is very clear and easy , we do not face the hard problem of quantifying entanglement of two - cavity non - gaussian state .",
    "our entanglement measure quantifying on atomic state and two - cavity state is accurate .",
    "our scheme is also a good example on the transition between microscopic state and macroscopic state ."
