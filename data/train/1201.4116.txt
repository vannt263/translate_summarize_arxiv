    "planning and optimization of lte network deployment , such as base station ( bs ) location and antenna parameter configuration , necessitate modeling and algorithmic approaches for network - level performance evaluation . finding the optimal network design and configuration amounts to solving an optimization problem of combinatorial nature . toward this end , system modeling admitting rapid performance assessment in order to facilitate the selection among candidate configuration solutions , of which the number is typically huge , is essential . in this paper",
    ", we provide a rigorous analysis of an lte system performance model that works for general network topology and explicitly accounts for non - uniform traffic demand . the performance model that we study",
    "is referred to as the load - coupling system , to emphasize the fact that the model characterizes the coupling relation between the cells in their load factors .",
    "for each cell , the load factor is defined as the amount of resource consumption in relation to that is available in the cell .",
    "the load value grows with the cell s traffic demand and the amount of inter - cell interference .",
    "intuitively , low load means that the network has more than enough capacity to meet the demand , whilst high load indicates poor performance in terms of congestion and potential service outage . in the latter case",
    ", the network design and configuration solution in question should be revised , by reconfiguration or adding bs infrastructure .",
    "thus , simple means for evaluating the cell load for a given candidate design solution is of high importance , particularly because the evaluation may have to be conducted for a large number of user demand and network configuration scenarios .",
    "the load - coupling model for lte networks takes the form of a non - trivial system of non - linear equations .",
    "calculating the solution to the model , or determining solution existence , is not straightforward . in this paper , we present contributions to characterizing and solving the load - coupling system model .",
    "first , we present a rigorous mathematical analysis of fundamental properties of the system and its solution .",
    "second , we develop and prove a sufficient and necessary condition for solution existence .",
    "third , we provide theoretical results that are important for numerically approaching the solution or delivering a bounding interval .",
    "fourth , we instructively illustrate the application of the system model for optimizing lte network configuration .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : related ] we review some related works . the system model is presented in section [ sec : model ] , and its fundamental properties are discussed in section [ sec : property ] . in section [ sec : linear ] , we present linear equation systems for the purpose of determining solution existence . in section [ sec : optimization ] , we provide the relation between solving the load - coupling system and convex optimization , and discuss approximate solutions .",
    "the application of the system model and our theoretical results to lte network optimization is illustrated in section [ sec : experiment ] , and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "planning and performance optimization in cellular networks form a very active line of research in wireless communications .",
    "there are many works on umts network planning and optimization .",
    "the research topics range from bs location and coverage planning @xcite , antenna parameter configuration @xcite , to cell load balancing @xcite . for umts ,",
    "the power control mechanism that links together the cells in resource consumption is an important aspect in performance modeling @xcite . by power control ,",
    "the transmit power of each link is adjusted to meet a given signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) threshold . by the sinr requirement ,",
    "the power expenditure of one cell is a linear function in those of the other cells . as a result ,",
    "the power control mechanism is represented by a system of linear equations , which sometimes is referred to as umts interference coupling @xcite .",
    "interference coupling can be modeled for both downlink and uplink . for network planning ,",
    "the interference coupling system needs to be solved many times for performance evaluation of different candidate network configurations and multiple or aggregate user demand snapshots . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that , for both downlink and uplink radio network planning , the dimension of the power - control - based system of equations can be reduced from the number of users in the system to the number of cells .",
    "the observation stems from system characteristics that also form the foundation of distributed power control mechanisms , see , e.g. , @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide theoretical properties of the power - control - based system , and feasibility conditions in terms of target data rates and qos requirements .",
    "motivated by the fact that full - scale dynamic simulation is not computationally affordable for large networks , the authors of @xcite extend the umts power - control system by a randomization - based procedure of service and rate adaptation for hsupa network planning .    in cellular network planning ,",
    "the power - control equation system is considered under given sinr threshold .",
    "thus the system solution and its existence are induced by the ( candidate ) network configuration in question . in a more general context of wireless communications ,",
    "power control is often a means in performance optimization , that is , the powers are optimization variables in minimizing or maximizing objectives representing error probability , utility , qos , etc .",
    ", that are all functions of sinr .",
    "there is a vast amount of theoretical analysis and algorithmic approaches for power optimization under various ( typically non - linear ) objective functions , where a gain matrix defines interference coupling @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors identify objective functions admitting a convex formulation of power optimization , and develop a distributed gradient - projection - based algorithm .",
    "further developments include algorithmic design utilizing kuhn - tucker condition @xcite , conditional newton iteration yielding quadratic convergence @xcite , and model extension to include explicit sinr - threshold constraints @xcite .",
    "another line of research of power control is the characterization of the achievable performance region under various utility functions and interference functions .",
    "the authors of @xcite show the strict convexity of the region for logarithmic functions of sinr . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors characterize utility functions and function transformation of power , for which the resulting power optimization problem is convex .",
    "the investigation in @xcite provides conditions under which the boundary points of the region are pareto - optimal . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present graph representations of power and interference , and study the relation between graph structure , irreducibility of the interference coupling matrix , and the convexity of the utility region .",
    "in contrast to the power - control model , the service requirement of rate - control scheme in cellular networks is not sinr threshold ( or a function of sinr ) , but the amount of data to be served over a given time period . among other advantages ,",
    "this approach makes it possible to capture the effect of scheduling without the need of explicitly modeling full details of scheduling algorithms .",
    "the rate - control - based approach is primarily targeting , although not limited to , non - power - controlled systems or systems with a fixed - rate traffic demand .",
    "the approach has been less studied , but is of a high interest for ofdma - based networks . in general , the rate - control scheme exhibits non - linear relations between the cell - coupling elements ( in our case , cell loads ) .",
    "the resulting model is therefore more complex than the power - control model for umts . for power control ,",
    "fundamental solution characterizations are well - established for linear as well as more general interference functions .",
    "for the latter , see , for example , @xcite . for rate - control - based coupling systems",
    "( see @xcite and section [ sec : model ] ) , a structural difference from power control is that , in the former , one element can not be expressed as a sum of terms , each being a function denoting the impact of another element , and the coupling is not scale invariant . for network planning , one known approach is to consider an approximate linear function , obtained from system - specific adaptive modulation and coding ( amc ) parameters , to represent the relation between date rate and sinr @xcite , and thereby arrive at a equation system being similar to that of umts .    from an engineering standpoint",
    ", lte network optimization is becoming increasingly important . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide the fundamental principles of lte network operation and radio resource allocation . among the optimization issues ,",
    "the research theme of scheduling strategies and radio resource management ( rrm ) algorithms has been extensively investigated .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "two major aspects considered in the references are the balance between resource efficiency and fairness , and quality of service awareness . in @xcite ,",
    "the author gives a survey of tools enabling service and subscriber differentiation . for cell planning , the propagation modeling , link budget consideration , and performance parameters have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "high - level and accurate performance modeling is of high value in planning cellular networks , as full - scale dynamic simulations are not affordable for large planning scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lte system model that we analyze has been introduced by siomina et al .",
    "@xcite for studying ofdm network capacity region with qos consideration .",
    "the work in @xcite does not , however , provide a general analysis of the model , and the major part of the study relies on a simplification assuming uniform load among cells . in the forthcoming sections , we present both analytical and numerical results without these limitations .    recently , the authors of @xcite have presented a non - linear lte performance model being very similar to the one studied in the current paper . that our performance model has been independently proposed by others",
    "supports the modeling approach .",
    "the work in @xcite provides further an approximation of load coupling via another non - linear but simpler equation system , along with incorporating continuous user distribution .",
    "our study differs from @xcite , as the focus of the current paper is a detailed investigation of key properties and solution characterization of the load coupling system .",
    "denote by @xmath0 the set of cells in a given network design solution . without loss of generality , we assume that each cell has one antenna to simplify notation . the service area",
    "is represented by a grid of pixels or small areas , each being characterized by uniform signal propagation conditions .",
    "the set of pixels is denoted by @xmath1 . the total power gain between antenna @xmath2 and pixel @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "we use @xmath5 to denote the serving area of cell @xmath2 . in a network planning context , both the gain matrix as well as the cells serving areas are determined by bs location and antenna configuration .    for realistic network planning scenarios ,",
    "the traffic demand is irregularly distributed .",
    "let the user demand in pixel @xmath3 be denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the demand represents the amount of data to be delivered to the users located in pixel @xmath3 within the time interval under consideration . by defining a service - specific index ,",
    "the demand parameter and the system model can be extended to multiple types of services ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will , however , consider one service type merely for the sake of compactness .",
    "we use @xmath7 to denote the level of resource consumption in cell @xmath2 .",
    "the entity is also referred to as cell load . in lte systems ,",
    "the cell load can be interpreted as the expected fraction of the time - frequency resources that are scheduled to deliver data .",
    "the network - wise load vector , @xmath8 , plays a key role in performance modeling .",
    "in particular , a well - designed network shall be able to meet the target demand scenarios without overloading the cells .",
    "hence the load vector forms a natural performance metric in network configuration ( cf .",
    "power consumption in umts networks ) .",
    "the load of a cell is a result of the user demands in the pixels in the cell serving area , the channel conditions , as well as the amount of interference .",
    "the last aspect inter - connects the elements in the load vector , as the load of a cell is determined by the sinrs and the resulting bit rates over the cell s serving area , and these values are in turn dependent on the load values of the other cells . to derive the performance model",
    ", we consider the sinr in pixel @xmath9 defined as follows ,    @xmath10    in , @xmath11 is the power spectral density per minimum resource unit in scheduling ( in lte , this corresponds to a pair of time - consecutive resource blocks ) , and @xmath12 is the noise power . by , the inter - cell interference grows by the load factor . in effect",
    ", @xmath13 can be interpreted as the probability of receiving interference originating from cell @xmath14 on all the sub - carriers of the resource unit .",
    "let @xmath15 be a function describing the effective bitrate per resource unit .",
    "this formula is shown to be very accurate for lte downlink @xcite . thus to serve demand @xmath6 in @xmath3 , @xmath16 resource units are required .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the total number of resource units in the frequency - time domain in question , and denote by @xmath18 the proportion of resource consumption of cell @xmath2 due to serving the users in @xmath9 .",
    "by these definitions , we obtain the following equation , @xmath19    from , it is clear that the load of a cell is a function of the load levels of other cells . observing that @xmath20 and putting the equations together lead to the following equation",
    ",    @xmath21    the equation above represents the coupling relation between cells in their resource consumption . in vector form",
    ", we have @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , represents the @xmath25 function as defined by ; here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are used to denote the single- and @xmath28-dimension space of all real non - negative numbers , respectively . since in the subsequent discussions",
    "there will be no ambiguity in the input parameters , we use the following compact notation to denote the non - linear equation system , @xmath29    from , three immediate observations follow .",
    "first , for all @xmath30 , the load function @xmath31 is strictly increasing in the load of other cells .",
    "second , for non - zero @xmath12 , this function is strictly positive when the load values of other cells ( and thus interference ) are all zeros , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "third , the function is continuous , and at least twice differentiable for @xmath33 .    from the network performance standpoint , the capacity is sufficient to support the traffic demand , if equation system admits a load vector @xmath34 with @xmath35 . in our analysis , however , we do not restrict @xmath34 to be at most one , in order to avoid any loss of generality .",
    "in addition , even if the solution contains elements being greater than one , the values are of significance in network planning , because they carry information of the amount of shortage of resource in relation to the demand .    solving deals with finding a fixed point ( aka invariant point ) of function @xmath36 in @xmath37 , or determines that such a point does not exist . in the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath38 as a general notation for the space of non - negative solutions ( fixed points ) to systems of equations or inequalities . the system in question",
    "is identified using subscript .",
    "thus , @xmath39 denotes the solution space of .",
    "note that , for as well as the linear equation systems to be introduced later , only non - negative solutions are of interest .",
    "hence , throughout the article , a ( linear or non - linear ) system is said to be feasible , if there exists a solution for which non - negativity holds , otherwise the system is said to be infeasible ( even if a solution of negative values exists ) .",
    "the case that is infeasible is denoted by @xmath40 .",
    "a useful optimization formulation in our analysis is the minimization of the total cell load , subject to the inequality form of .",
    "the formulation is given below .",
    "[ eq : optrho ] @xmath41    for , its solution space @xmath42 is also referred to as the feasible load region .",
    "recall that @xmath43 is strictly increasing , hence if @xmath44 , then for any optimal solution to , holds with equality , as otherwise can be improved , contradicting that the solution is optimal . in conclusion ,",
    "any optimum of is a solution to .",
    "we end the section by an illustration of the load - coupling system for two cells in figure [ fig : twocell ] .",
    "the two cells have symmetric parameters . in the figure ,",
    "the two non - linear functions are given by the solid lines .",
    "in the first two cases , system has solutions in @xmath45 , though one of them represents a solution beyond the network capacity . in the last case ,",
    "the system is infeasible , as the two curves will never intersect in the first quadrant .",
    "the straight lines with markers in the figure represent linear equations related to .",
    "details of these linear equations are deferred to section [ sec : linear ] .",
    "in this section , we present and prove some fundamental properties of the load - coupling system .",
    "these theoretical results are of key importance in the study of solution existence and computation . for compactness",
    ", we introduce additional notation to simplify while keeping the essence of the equation .",
    "define @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "these parameters contain , respectively , the relation between the demand in pixel @xmath3 and the resource in cell @xmath2 , the inter - cell coupling in gain between cells @xmath14 and @xmath2 in pixel @xmath3 , and the channel quality of cell @xmath2 in relation to noise in pixel @xmath3 .",
    "the load equation can then be written in the following form , @xmath49    the first fundamental property of is how fast the load of a cell asymptotically grows in the load of another cell .",
    "we formulate and prove the fact that , in the limit , the first - order partial derivative of the load function converges to a constant .",

    "@xmath57    the theorem follows then from the facts that @xmath58 and @xmath59 is linear in @xmath13 .    by theorem [ theo : partiallimit ]",
    ", the load of a cell increases linearly in the load of another cell in the limit , i.e. , the function converges to a line in the high - load region .",
    "moreover , the slope of the line is strictly positive .",
    "the next fundamental property is concavity .",
    "the examples in figure [ fig : twocell ] indicate that the load of a cell is a strictly concave function in the other cell s load .",
    "we show that this is generally true .",
    "[ theo : concave ] for any cell @xmath60 , @xmath31 is strictly concave for @xmath61 .    without loss of generality ,",

    "two layers of users are generated , with 30 users per macro cell area in total , out of which 2/3 ( the dot markers ) is in a randomly placed hotspot , and 1/3 ( the x - markers ) are distributed randomly and uniformly over the area . each user equipment has an omni - directional antenna with 0  dbi antenna gain .",
    "the traffic demand corresponds to 400  kbit / s for all users within a duration of one second in the time domain .",
    "two network configurations are illustrated in figure  [ fig : experiment_configs ] , with the only difference being the antenna direction of cell  1 , which impacts the sets of users served by the cell and its neighbors .",
    "intuitively , configuration two is inferior , since it results in that the hotspot users in cell  1 s original coverage area ( see figure  [ fig : experiment_config1 ] ) is to be served by cell  8 and/or cell  9 , although these users are relatively far away from the two cells .",
    "the likely impact is poorer link quality for the users in the handed - over hotspot as well as increased number of users to be served by the neighbors of cell  1 .",
    "these effects are expected to be seen in the load of the neighbor cells .",
    "first , for both configurations , the existence of system solutions has been verified by finding @xmath252 to the corresponding linear system , as described in section  [ sec : linear ] .",

    ", the load of cell  1 does not decrease either , even though it serves fewer users under the second configuration .",
    "this is due to a joint effect of several factors .",
    "firstly , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : experiment_config2 ] , users served by cell  1 are likely to experience high interference from cell  6 and vice versa . from figure",
    "[ fig : experiment_load_hist2 ] , we observe that the load of cell  6 has also slightly increased .",
    "secondly , the increased load in cells  8 and 9 implies more frequent transmissions in these cells and thus higher probability of interference to other cells ; this in turn increases the load of the other cells , which can also be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : experiment_load_hists ] .",
    "we further note that the solution @xmath253 and thus the second configuration are not feasible from the capacity point of view .    in figure",
    "[ fig : experiment_load_hists ] , we also illustrate the load solutions to the linear systems described in section  [ sec : optimization ] , i.e. , the upper bound @xmath254 assuming @xmath255 .",
    "table  [ tab : bounds ] provides further details of the quality of both the lower and upper bounds obtained for all 9 cells in configuration  1 for which the solution is illustrated in figure  [ fig : experiment_config1 ] .",
    "the tight upper bound indicates the efficiency of the linear approximation described in section  [ sec : optimization ] . in average , the estimation is deviates only a few percent from the true load value .",
    "for @xmath256 the values are significantly lower than @xmath99 , as @xmath257 represents a very optimistic view of load coupling .",
    "the observation sheds further light on the importance of fundamental characterization that the two systems are completely equivalent in solution existence , despite the large difference in numerical values of @xmath256 and @xmath99 .",
    "improving the lower bounds , although being beyond the scope of the current paper , is an interesting topic for future investigation .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the model discussed in this paper is applied for load balancing , for which very tight lower and upper bounds are obtained using few fixed - point iterations .",
    "it should be further noted that although the results have been presented for downlink , the model and the theoretical findings can be also applied to uplink .",
    "for the two network configurations , in figure  [ fig : feasibility ] we illustrate the behavior of the cell - load coupling with respect to demand , which is successively scaled up uniformly over the service area .",
    "figure  [ fig : feasibility_nonlinear ] and figure  [ fig : feasibility_linear ] show , respectively , the results for the nonlinear load - coupling system , and the linear equation system @xmath257 that provides lower estimation and characterizes feasibility of .",
    "the two configurations are distinguished by using respectively solid and dotted curves for the load solutions of nine cells . in figure",
    "[ fig : feasibility_nonlinear ] , the thicker curves represent the load of cell 8 . for the linear system , only the maximum value among the cells is shown in figure  [ fig : feasibility_linear ] for the sake of clarity .    from figure",
    "[ fig : feasibility_nonlinear ] , it is apparent that the solution values of grow rapidly in the high - demand region , and becomes infeasible beyond some point .",
    "the feasibility boundaries for the two configurations are shown by the vertical lines .",
    "configuration one is clearly superior , as its load values , shown by the solid curves , are below those of configuration two , and the feasibility boundary is considerably higher . for configuration two ,",
    "cell 8 has the highest load ( the dotted thick line ) . using configuration one ,",
    "some of the users are served by cell 1 instead ( see figure  [ fig : experiment_configs ] ) , leading to lower load in cell 8 ( the solid thick line ) .",
    "note that , for both configurations , when getting somewhat close to the infeasible region , the solver gives solutions containing some zero elements , indicating the solution is invalid ( the system becomes unstable ) , before all the values abruptly drop to zeros showing infeasibility .",
    "when this occurs , the distance to the feasibility boundary is , in fact , significant .",
    "the behavior shows the importance of our analysis of characterizing feasibility exactly by the linear system @xmath258 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : feasibility_linear ] , the linear system gives values growing consistently in demand .",
    "the system gives the feasibility boundary point of the non - linear load coupling equations , when the determinant of @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the identity matrix and @xmath261 is the matrix defined for @xmath148 , equals zero .",
    "after passing the boundary point , the linear system returns negative ( infeasible ) solutions .",
    "hence the numerical results verify that the significance of the linear system to identifying solution existence .",
    "moreover , using the linear system , one is able to conclude , as shown in figure  [ fig : feasibility ] , that configuration one is clearly superior to configuration two .",
    "we have provided a theoretical analysis of the lte load coupling system originally presented in @xcite and have derived its fundamental properties , including concavity , behavior in limit , and solution uniqueness .",
    "we have also formulated the necessary and sufficient condition for solution existence , the analysis leads to a simple means for determining feasibility .",
