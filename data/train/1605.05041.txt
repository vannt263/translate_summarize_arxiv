    "the tensor force get a major role in the nucleon - nucleon interaction . indeed in a boson exchange picture the nuclear interaction is generated at long range by a pion exchange between two nucleons .",
    "the associated potential ( one pion exchange potential ) is composed by a central and a tensor term .",
    "besides the requirement to include a tensor term to the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction is supported by some well known experimental data such as the none zero quadrupole moment of the deuteron @xcite or the differential cross section of the p - p scattering .",

    "its impact on the shell structure properties has been studied in a large extent : its contribution to the single particle energies depends on the filling of the shells ; it induces correlations which strongly influence the n - p pairs structures in light nuclei @xcite ; the tensor force enables to get a convenient spectrum in the p - shell @xcite .",
    "in contrast the tensor term was initially neglected in self - consistent mean field theories except for a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized here that in effective field theories some part of the bare tensor interaction is already taken into account in the central part of the effective interaction . as a consequence",
    "only the residual tensor interaction was neglected in the usual skyrme @xcite or gogny @xcite effective interactions .",
    "however the tensor force get a renewed interest over the past few years in mean field theories . a lot of works recently aimed to determine the most reliable tensor term built - in effective interaction .",
    "it is now clear that the tensor term modifies the single particle energies @xcite and the binding energies @xcite , the multipoles giant resonances @xcite and even may affect the magic numbers and the spin - orbit splitting in some cases @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the tensor term in the effective interaction has been done in perturbation from pre - existing parametrizations @xcite where all the other parameters remain unchanged . alongside a full variational procedure",
    "is performed to get the new parametrizations for the skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite interactions . in all cases",
