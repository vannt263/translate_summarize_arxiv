    "a basic issue in social dynamics is to understand how opinion diversity arises when interactions between individuals are primarily `` ferromagnetic '' in character .",
    "many kinetic spin models have been proposed to address this general question @xcite .",
    "an important example of this genre is the appealingly simple axelrod model @xcite , which accounts for the formation of distinct cultural domains within a population . in the axelrod model ,",
    "each individual is endowed with a set of features ( such as political leaning , music preference , choice of newspaper , _ etc . _ ) , with a fixed number of choices for each feature .",
    "evolution occurs by the following voter - model - like update step @xcite .",
    "a random individual is picked and this person selects an interaction partner ( anybody in the mean - field limit , and a nearest - neighbor for finite spatial dimension ) . for this pair of agents a feature is randomly selected .",
    "if these agents have the same state for this feature , then another feature is picked and the initial person adopts the state of this new feature from the interaction partner .",
    "this dynamics mimics the feature that individuals who share similar sentiments on lifestyle issues can have a meaningful interaction in which one will convince the other of a preference on an issue where disagreement exists .",
    "depending on the number of traits and the number of states per trait , a population may evolve to global consensus or it may break up into distinct cultural domains , in which individuals in different domains do not have any common traits @xcite .",
    "this diversity is perhaps the most striking feature of the axelrod model .",
    "an even simpler example with a related phenomenology is the bounded compromise model @xcite . here",
    ", each individual possesses a single real - valued opinion that evolves by compromise . in an update step ,",
    "two interacting individuals average their opinions if their opinion difference is within a pre - set threshold .",
    "however , if this difference is greater than the threshold , there is no interaction .",
    "these steps are repeated until the system reaches a final state . for a sufficiently large threshold",
    "the final state is consensus , while for a smaller threshold the system breaks up into distinct opinion clusters ; these are analogous to the cultural domains of the axelrod model .    in spite of the simplicity of these models ,",
    "most of our understanding stems from simulation results . as a first step toward analytic insight , a discrete three - state version of the bounded compromise model",
    "was recently introduced @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps the simplest opinion dynamics model that includes the competing features of consensus and incompatibility .",
    "this model was found to exhibit a variety of anomalous features in low dimensions , including slow non - universal kinetics and power - law spatial organization of single - opinion domains . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the ultimate fate of this system in the mean - field limit .",
    "we determine the exact probability that the final state of the system is either consensus or a frozen mixture of leftists and rightists as a function of the initial composition of the system .",
    "we also compute the time required for the system to reach its ultimate state .    in the next section ,",
    "we define our model , outline its basic properties , and determine the ultimate fate of the system in terms of an equivalent first - passage process .",
    "the solution to this problem is used to obtain the probabilities of reaching either a frozen final state ( sec .",
    "iii ) or consensus ( sec .",
    "iv ) . in sec .",
    "v , we compute the mean time until the final state is reached . in the discussion section ,",
    "we generalize to non - symmetric interactions and also show how our results can be adapted to determine the ultimate fate of a version of the axelrod model .",
    "calculational details are presented in the appendices .",
    "we consider a population of @xmath0 individuals , or agents , that are located at the nodes of a graph",
    ". each agent can be in one of three opinion states : leftist , centrist , or rightist . as shown in fig .",
    "[ steps ] , we represent these states as @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , respectively . in a single microscopic event an agent is selected at random .",
    "we consider the mean - field limit in which the neighbor of an agent can be anyone else in the system .",
    "if the two agents have the same opinion , nothing happens .",
    "if one is a centrist and the other is an extremist ( or vice versa ) , the initial agent adopts the opinion of its neighbor  that is , each individual can be viewed as having zero self - confidence and merely adopts the state of a compatible neighbor ; this kinetic step is the same as in the classical voter model @xcite .",
    "however , if the two agents are extremists of opposite persuasions , they are incompatible and do not influence each other . as a result of this incompatibility constraint , the final state of the system can be either consensus of any of the three species , or a frozen mixture of leftist and rightist extremists , with no centrists .        in a mean - field system with @xmath3 leftists , @xmath4 rightists , and @xmath5 centrists ( with @xmath6 ) , the probability of selecting a pair @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) equals @xmath9 $ ] , where @xmath10 is the number of agents of type @xmath11 .",
    "then the elemental update steps and their respective probabilities are : @xmath12 while the probability for no change is @xmath13 .    .",
    "the heavy dots denote consensus states and the heavy line denotes the frozen final states where no centrists remain .",
    "typical random walk trajectories are shown , along with their projections ( dashed ) on the @xmath14 plane .",
    "when a random walk reaches the lines @xmath15 or @xmath16 , the random walk subsequently must remain on this line until consensus is reached .",
    "the corresponding hopping probabilities on the @xmath14 plane are also indicated.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    eventually the system reaches a static final state that is either consensus of one of the three species or a frozen mixture of leftists and rightists .",
    "monte carlo simulations showed that the nature of the final state has a non - trivial dependence on the initial densities of the species @xcite .",
    "we now analytically determine this final state probability as a function of the initial population composition by solving an equivalent first - passage problem .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ 3d - triangle ] , the state of the system corresponds to a point in the space of densities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath20 , this constraint restricts the system to the triangle @xmath21 shown in the figure .",
    "when two agents interact , the state of the system may change and we can view this change as a step of a corresponding random walk on the triangle @xmath21 , with single step hopping probabilities given in eq .",
    "( [ hops ] ) .",
    "when the walk reaches one of the fixed points @xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24 ( consensus ) , or any point on the fixed line @xmath25 ( frozen extremist mixture ) , the system stops evolving .",
    "this set represents absorbing boundaries for the effective random walk .",
    "thus to find the probability of reaching a given final state , we compute the first - passage probability for the random walk to hit a given absorbing boundary .",
    "we may simplify the problem by using the fact that only two of the densities @xmath26 are independent .",
    "we thus choose @xmath27 and @xmath28 as the independent variables by projecting the effective random walk trajectory onto the @xmath14 plane ( fig .",

    "here @xmath31 , and we consider the limit @xmath32 .",
    "we now determine the probability @xmath33 for the system to reach a frozen state when the initial densities are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this coincides with the first - passage probability for the equivalent random walk to hit the line @xmath36 when it starts at a general point @xmath37 in the interior of the triangle .",
    "there are also absorbing boundaries on the sides @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where the probability of reaching the frozen state is zero , and @xmath38 on the line segment @xmath36 .",
    "for notational simplicity , we write @xmath39 . in the equivalent random walk process , this first - passage probability obeys the recursion @xcite @xmath40\\nonumber \\\\   & + & p_y[f(x , y-\\delta)+f(x , y+\\delta ) ] \\nonumber \\\\   & + & [ 1 - 2(p_x+p_y)]f(x , y ) . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the first - passage probability @xmath41 equals the probability of taking a step in some direction ( the factor @xmath42 ) times the first - passage probability from this target site to the boundary .",

    "our calculations are based on the mean - field limit in which each individual interacts with any other individual with equal probability .",
