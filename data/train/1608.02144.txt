    "shot noise describes the fluctuations of current , and it is an inherent characteristic of nano - devices because of the quantization of electron charge . unlike for thermal noise which describes the equilibrium property of fluctuation in the occupation number of discrete charged particles @xmath9 , we have to investigate the non - equilibrium ( transport ) state of the system to observe the shot noise .",
    "generally , the thermal noise is directly dependent on temperature and gives rise to the occupation number of the states of a system to fluctuate . during the past two decades ,",
    "the study of shot noise has attracted increasing attention both experimentally and theoretically @xcite since it can give us more detailed information about transport features compared to that of the current .",

    "more attention has been paid on the charge current correlation compared with the polarized spin current correlation @xcite .",
    "because of the discreteness of the spin carrier , the information related to spin can be derived from the spin current fluctuations .",
    "shot noise of spin - polarized current has been investigated in several quantum devices containing n - m - n ( normal - magnetic - normal)@xcite and f - n - f(ferromagnet - normal - ferromagnet)@xcite . in these devices , shot noise is expected to provide extra information about spin accumulation and spin - dependent scattering process . as it is clear , the charge current correlation between different contacts ( cross correlation noise ) is definitely negative for a two - contact normal system,@xcite .",
    "on the other side , the spin cross correlation noise between different contacts is not necessarily negative for a magnetic connection because of spin flip mechanism .",
    "for instance , ref.[12 ] showed that the cross correlation at specific fermi energy can be positive in view of rashba interaction .    despite some theoretical and experimental efforts on systems with two metal contacts@xcite , often gold",
    ", intriguing physics occurs when one or both contacts are substituted by semiconductors contacts@xcite which includes negative differential resistance and rectification@xcite . using scattering matrix theory and a generalized green s function method in this present article , we studied the effect of both spin and charge shot noise on electronic conductance of the scattering qd connected to two semiconductor contacts including silicon and titanium dioxide which has not been studied so far .",
