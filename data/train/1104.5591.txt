    "current cosmological observations are now very precise to give a stringent constraint on the adiabaticity of density fluctuations",
    ". however , some contribution of non - adiabatic fluctuations , so - called isocurvature fluctuations , is still allowed ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "isocurvature fluctuations can be generated in cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryon sectors , from which we can have some insight on the nature of dark matter and/or the mechanism of the baryogenesis .",
    "this is because isocurvature fluctuations might be produced depending on how dark matter / baryon number is generated .",
    "such examples are axion @xcite and affleck - dine baryogenesis mechanism @xcite in which cdm and baryon isocurvature fluctuations can respectively be generated . if such a mode is found to be non - zero , it would give invaluable information on cdm / baryogenesis scenarios .",
    "currently , stringent constraints on isocurvature fluctuations come from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations such as wmap @xcite . however , cmb can not discriminate cdm and baryon ones since these two isocurvature modes give indistinguishable cmb angular power spectra .",
    "the initial non - zero isocurvature mode of cdm / baryon affects fluctuations of photons , at which we are looking in cmb observations , only through gravity .",
    "cdm and baryon can be regarded as the same component as far as the gravity is concerned , hence the effects of isocurvature fluctuations arise in exactly the same way for cmb anisotropy ( except the amplitude which depends on the amount of cdm and baryon ) .",
    "thus even if we see some signature of existence of the isocurvature mode from cmb measurements , we can not tell whether cdm or baryon is responsible for that . from the viewpoint of testing dark matter models / baryogenesis mechanism ,",
    "it is very crucial to differentiate these two modes in some way , which is the issue we are going to discuss in this paper .",
    "although cmb measurement can not do this task , the evolution of density fluctuations of cdm and baryon themselves are not the same for models with initial cdm and baryon isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "thus we may have some possibility for differentiating those by looking at ( cdm / baryon ) fluctuations directly .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how one can probe the difference between these two isocurvature modes by using observations of fluctuations in redshifted 21 cm line absorption .",
    "as mentioned above , cdm and baryon fluctuations evolve differently when one assume different isocurvature modes ( i.e. , cdm and baryon ones ) . hence ,",
    "if either one can be probed directly in some way , we can in principle see the difference . since 21 cm fluctuations effectively probe baryon density fluctuations , the observations of them can be utilized for this purpose .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the evolution and effects of density fluctuations of cdm and baryon in models with isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "we explain in some detail what aspect differs between cdm and baryon isocurvature modes by looking at density fluctuations of cdm and baryon in these modes . then in section 3 , we show that 21 cm fluctuations can in principle differentiate the cdm and baryon isocurvature modes , which is impossible with cmb observations .",
    "we also demonstrate a future constraint on cdm and baryon isocurvature fluctuations by utilizing future 21 cm survey and discuss to what extent they can be discriminated .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary of this paper .",
    "before we start the discussion on the evolution of density fluctuations , here we give some definitions , in particular , regarding isocurvature fluctuations to set our notation .",
    "gauge - invariant isocurvature fluctuations between the components @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined as @xmath8 in the following , we mainly consider isocurvature fluctuations of cdm and baryon with respect to radiation , which we write as @xmath9 furthermore , in this paper we only consider uncorrelated type of isocurvature fluctuations .",
    "thus cdm and baryon isocurvature modes can be respectively identified as the ones with non - vanishing @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 being the conformal time , at the early times when the initial conditions are set for cosmological density fluctuations .",
    "then the primordial power spectrum for isocurvature fluctuations is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 indicating cdm and baryon , respectively , and we parametrize @xmath16 as @xmath17 with @xmath18 is the spectral index for the mode @xmath6 . in this paper , we take the reference scale @xmath19 as @xmath20 . for cdm and baryon isocurvature modes , we denote it as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . for the adiabatic ( curvature ) fluctuations , similarly to the above , one usually defines as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the curvature perturbation and the power spectrum @xmath25 can also be written as @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the spectral index for the adiabatic mode .",
    "current cosmological observations such as wmap indicate that cosmic density fluctuations are almost adiabatic and pure isocurvature fluctuations of any modes are excluded .",
    "however , some fraction ( contamination ) of isocurvature fluctuations are still allowed . to characterize the fractions of the isocurvature modes , we define the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath29 as ] which is a bit different from the one used here . however , as far as the fraction of the isocurvature fluctuations is small , both definitions are almost equivalent . ]",
    "@xmath30 from current observations , @xmath31 is constrained to be less than about 10 % @xcite .",
    "( the corresponding constraint on @xmath29 becomes less severe by the factor of @xmath32 . )",
    "thus we use @xmath33 as a reference value unless otherwise stated in the following .",
    "now we study the evolutions of density fluctuations in models with cdm and baryon isocurvature fluctuations and see the difference of those between in these isocurvature modes , which could be probed with 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "in addition , we also discuss why cmb can not discriminate these two isocurvature modes at linear perturbation level .    in the following , we investigate density perturbations in the synchronous gauge where the metric perturbations are defined as @xmath34,\\ ] ] with @xmath35.\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath12 is the conformal time and @xmath36 is the scale factor .",
    "we denote density fluctuations of a species @xmath6 as @xmath37 . in particular , here we study those of cdm @xmath38 , baryon @xmath39 and photons @xmath40 .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite .    in this gauge ,",
    "the perturbed einstein equations are : @xmath41 where a dot represents the derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath12 and @xmath42 is the hubble parameter defined with the conformal time derivative .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are fluctuations of energy density and pressure for the total component .",
    "@xmath45 is a variable defined as @xmath46 with @xmath47 being velocity perturbation of species @xmath6 and @xmath48 represents the anisotropic stress of the total component .",
    "the equation for the cdm fluctuations is @xmath49 here we note that the velocity perturbation for cdm is set as @xmath50 so that we can fix the gauge freedom in the synchronous gauge . for baryon",
    ", we have @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cross section for the thomson scattering and @xmath53 is the number density of electron , and we also have defined @xmath54 . for photons ,",
    "the equations are : @xmath55 similarly , for neutrinos , the equations of motion are @xmath56 here we have omitted the equation for the anisotropic stress and higher multipole moments for photons and those for neutrinos since they are not so relevant to our discussion and we do not discuss in the following .    during the epoch deep in the radiation dominated era ,",
    "the time scale of the thomson scattering is much shorter than the hubble expansion , which dampens anisotropic stress of photons and drives the velocity perturbations of baryon and photons the same .",
    "thus in the above equations , we can set @xmath57 and @xmath58 in early times when the initial conditions are given .",
    "furthermore , on superhorizon scales , the terms with velocity perturbations can be regarded as smaller by a factor of @xmath59 , which allows us to neglect those terms at leading order of @xmath59 .",
    "then we obtain the following relations at the leading order in @xmath60 : @xmath61 which shows that the evolutions of @xmath62 follows that of @xmath63 with some numerical factors except a constant term which can be determined by the initial condition for the perturbations .    on the other hand , inside the horizon ,",
    "the evolutions of fluctuations are different from those on superhorizon scales .",
    "although cdm holds the relation with the metric perturbation @xmath63 with eq .",
    ", on subhorizon scales where @xmath64 , baryon and photons obey the following equations : @xmath65 since inside the horizon , @xmath38 grows as @xmath66 during radiation - dominated ( rd ) era and @xmath67 during matter - dominated ( md ) era , the metric perturbation @xmath63 also evolves as @xmath68 and @xmath69 during rd and md eras , respectively . since the scale factor can be given by the conformal time @xmath12 as @xmath70 and @xmath71 during rd and md eras , respectively , from eqs .   and",
    ", @xmath39 and @xmath40 show oscillatory behaviors with almost constant amplitudes except the epoch of the transition from rd to md .",
    "as will be discussed shortly , these behaviors are the same for adiabatic and isocurvature modes except the phases of the oscillations due to the difference of the initial conditions of these modes which are given when the fluctuations enter the horizon .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : pink_rc_rb ] , we show projected constraints for @xmath31 and @xmath29 from cmbpol alone ( solid red contours ) and cmbpol+fftt ( shared regions ) . regarding the observed redshifts of fftt survey , we analyzed four different combinations : @xmath72 ( top left ) , @xmath73 ( top right ) @xmath74 ( bottom left ) and all these redshifts combined ( bottom right ) . here",
    "the fiducial values are assumed as @xmath75 and @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "other cosmological parameters are assumed as those given in the previous section .",
    "since cmb alone can not in principle make a distinction between cdm and baryon isocurvature models , the constraint from cmbpol alone is completely degenerate along the line which gives the same amount of isocurvature fluctuations in term of matter : @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "however , as one can see from the figure , by including 21 cm surveys , the degeneracy can be removed , which means that we can see the difference between cdm and baryon isocurvature modes with 21 cm fluctuation surveys , in particular , when isocurvature modes have very blue - tilted spectra such as @xmath77 .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the difference between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is more prominent at higher redshifts . on the other hand ,",
    "observational sensitivity is better for lower redshifts . for a fixed band width @xmath80 and a maximum wave number for the linear perturbation evolution @xmath81 , the increase in the signal overwhelms the increase in noise and the most stringent constraint",
    "is obtained at the highest redshift @xmath74 .",
    "we also note that the constraint from the combination of three redshifts @xmath72 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is at least twice as stringent as one from a single redshift @xmath74 .",
    "this suggest that a combination of different redshifts offers to some extent a synergy in discriminating the cdm and baryon isocurvature perturbations .",
    "this comes from the fact that parameter degeneracies between @xmath31 or @xmath29 and other cosmological parameters more or less differ at different redshifts . by combining observations at different redshifts ,",
    "parameter degeneracies are partially removed and this gives severer constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",
    "otherwise , the constraint from the combination of three redshifts would be at most as @xmath84 times tighter as one from @xmath74 , which is the most stringent if a single redshift is observed .",
    "finally we comment on the dependence of constraints on the spectral indices of primordial isocurvature power spectra . in fig .",
    "[ fig : red_rc_rb ] , we show constraints in the @xmath31-@xmath29 plane for the case of @xmath85 . as can be expected from the discussion in the previous section , constraints on @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath29 significantly degrade as the spectral indices becomes smaller . for the @xmath85",
    ", we may marginally discriminate the cdm and baryon isocurvature perturbations for a fiducial model @xmath86 .",
    "the significance is at around 1 @xmath48 level from an observation at single redshift @xmath74 . by combining observations at all redshifts ,",
    "the significance can be improved to around 2 @xmath48 level .",
    "however , note that to what extent we can discriminate the cdm and baryon isocurvature perturbations depends on the maximum wave number for linear evolution .",
    "while we adopted a fixed @xmath87mpc@xmath88 at any observed redshifts , the use of larger @xmath81 may be allowed as redshift becomes higher , which may offer more stringent constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath29 . on the other hand , for the case of @xmath89 we found fftt does not improve constraints on @xmath31 and @xmath31 from cmbpol alone regardless of observed redshifts .",
    "this is what we expect from the top panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : pk_21_1 ] . thus the cdm and baryon isocurvature perturbations would be hardly distinguished if their power spectra are nearly scale invariant .",
    "in this paper , we discussed a possibility of differentiating cdm and baryon isocurvature fluctuations with 21 cm survey . as is well - known , by using cmb observations , we can not in principle see the difference between those modes although they can give a severe constraint on the sum of the size ( fraction ) of such isocurvature modes .",
    "however , once it is confirmed that cdm / baryon isocurvature perturbation should contribute to density fluctuations in the universe even if the size is small , it would be very important to differentiate those modes since they can give invaluable information on the nature of dark matter / generation mechanism of baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we showed that 21 cm fluctuation survey , which effectively probes density fluctuations of baryon , can in principle differentiate cdm and baryon isocurvature modes as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pk_21_1 ] and [ fig : pk_21_2 ] . to see this issue in some quantitative manner , we made a fisher matrix analysis and discussed to what extent 21 cm survey",
    "can remove the complete degeneracy between the fractions of cdm and baryon isocurvature modes which resides in cmb .",
    "when isocurvature fluctuations have scale - invariant primordial spectra , it seems very difficult to see the difference even with the fft telescope .",
    "however , if isocurvature modes have very blue - tilted spectra , which is claimed to be favored by observations @xcite , and is predicted in some axion model @xcite , it would be possible to distinguish cdm and baryon isocurvature modes , which we have explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pink_rc_rb ] .",
    "the adiabaticity of density fluctuations can give important information on various aspects of the universe .",
    "in particular , in light that cdm / baryon isocurvature fluctuations might be generated in well - motivated scenarios of cdm and baryogenesis like axion models and affleck - dine baryogenesis , the differentiation of these two modes , which has been shown to be possible by using 21 cm fluctuation survey in this paper , may well give important implications for understanding the nature of cdm and baryogenesis scenario .",
