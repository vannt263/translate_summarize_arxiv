    "energy and @xmath10 the electromagnetic coupling constant .",
    "if no resonances are present , the @xmath6 values solely from the continuum hadrons are well known to be @xmath11 in the lowest order approximation , with @xmath12 being quark flavors and @xmath13 the corresponding quark charge .",
    "the higher order corrections from the finite quark masses and the gluonic emission could be calculated by perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite .",
    "so the measurement of @xmath6 is important for testing the validity of both pqcd calculation and hadronic vacuum polarization correction .",
    "the @xmath6 for the continuum light hadron ( containing @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath9 quarks ) production , denoted as @xmath2 in this letter , is usually used to test the validity of the pqcd calculation in relatively low energy region .",
    "precise measurements of the @xmath2 near the @xmath16 threshold are reported by bes collaboration @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 value below the @xmath16 threshold is not affected by the first @xmath16 open charm resonance @xmath0 , therefore , determination of @xmath2 is very simple for the case .",
    "the @xmath2 in the energy region from 3.650 to 3.732 gev is determined to be @xmath17 @xcite , which is in good agreement with @xmath18 predicted by pqcd @xcite .",

    "it is extracted to be @xmath19 in the energy region from 3.660 to 3.872 gev @xcite and to be @xmath20 in the energy region from 3.650 to 3.872 gev  @xcite .",
    "there are obvious differences among the obtained @xmath2 values and also the pqcd calculation . as a matter of fact",
    ", these extracted @xmath2 values depend on the treatment of resonances in the @xmath0 region .",

    "the anomalous line shape of the @xmath0 state should be treated carefully .",
    "it has been found at the very beginning that the total cross sections of @xmath4 in the energy range between 3.700 and 3.872 gev could not be described well with only one breit - wigner ( bw ) resonance even using the energy - dependent width of the @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "has inspired a lot of interesting theoretical efforts @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements from both bes and cleo collaborations show that the @xmath0 resonance mainly decays to @xmath16 channel though the specific decay ratio is still under discussion @xcite .",
    "however , the rescattering of final @xmath16 is found to be not enough to account for its line shape deviation @xcite .",
    "now it is explained to be the consequence of the interference between the @xmath0 resonance and the continuum background from the @xmath28 contribution @xcite .",
    "its implication to the nature of @xmath0 state is also investigated in the fano mechanism @xcite . in the fano theory ,",
    "the asymmetric line shape of states is produced by the interference of continuum and resonance , which is giving rise to a general physical phenomenon in many quantum system , e.g. the nuclear , atomic , condensed matter physics and molecular spectroscopy .",

    "this is obviously true for other hadron states . however , here we do not dig into this issue and parameterize @xmath52 as @xmath56 for simplicity .",

    "because @xmath42 could be determined by the leptonic width @xmath70 , we perform two separate fits to the data . one of them ( fit i ) is to fix @xmath71 by the @xmath72 kev in particle data group @xcite , and the other is to let it being a free parameter ( fit ii ) . the curves in fig .",

    "however , the errors of the @xmath2 are on the same level of besiii result , and it still has some room for the improvement of the fit quality . these are probably due to the big uncertainties of the data , whose systematic errors are around the same scale of the statistical errors and not included here yet @xcite . as a reference , the @xmath77 could be close to 1.0 within above formula in a similar fit to the data of @xmath5 reactions @xcite .    .",

    "so it could deduce that the uncertainty of @xmath51 in fit ii comes from the coincidence of the fitted @xmath67 and the dip position .",
    "in addition , the sign of @xmath51 varies in fit i and ii , and this is caused by the fitted @xmath67 in these two fits are lying on the opposite sides of the dip position .",
    "it is found that the fitted @xmath67 both in fit i and ii are larger than the bw values in pdg @xcite , even considering their big uncertainties .",

    "the obtained @xmath42 in fit ii is bigger than that of the pdg value and the corresponding leptonic width @xmath29 is around 2.7 times bigger than that of the pdg .",
