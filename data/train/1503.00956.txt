    "<S> quantum systems with sublevel structures prevent full population inversion from one manifold of sublevels to the other using strong ultrafast resonant pulses . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we explain the mechanism by which this population transfer is blocked . </S>",
    "<S> we then develop a novel concept of geometric control , assuming full or partial coherent manipulation within the manifolds and show that by preparing specific coherent superpositions in the initial manifold , full population inversion or full population blockade , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e _ laser - induced transparency , can be achieved . in particular , by parallel population transfer we show how population inversion between the manifolds can be obtained with minimal pulse area . as the number of sublevels increases , </S>",
    "<S> population inversion can overcome the pulse area theorem at the expense of full control over the initial manifold of sublevels .    </S>",
    "<S> in this work we are concerned with intrinsic properties of the dynamics of systems with manifolds of sublevels , described by two ( or more ) quantum numbers , that hereafter will be generically called quantum structures . from the point of view of controlling the system dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> quantum structures pose several interesting problems . </S>",
    "<S> quantum control@xcite typically implies the ability to manipulate interfering pathways , which increases with the number of levels that participate in the dynamics as long as the system is _ controllable _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a multi - level structure would therefore offer more control opportunities at the expense of the ability to manipulate within the substructures . </S>",
    "<S> our general goal is to investigate whether quantum structures limit , or conversely help , in controlling the system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will be concerned with coarse - grained goals , where the objective of the control will be the state of the manifold given by the first quantum number , not the detailed state of the sublevels . in finding the best possible controls we will _ assume _ that the substructure is partially controllable , </S>",
    "<S> that is , that given some constraints , any possible wave function within a subset of the sublevels can be prepared @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> building on this assumption we will develop a _ geometric control _ approach that allows finding the optimal initial wave functions that maximize the yield of the desired process . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure does not prescribe an optimal field , but implicitly assumes that a field can be found , and makes full use of the quantum structures . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple and very general process in systems with a congested spectrum : absorption from the ground , initial manifold to the excited , target manifold , by means of a strong ultrashort pulse , with a bandwidth much larger than the energy spacing of the sublevels within the fine structure . as a molecular example </S>",
    "<S> , we can conceive controlling an electronic transition using a broadband pulse , where the goal is to invert the population to the excited state , regardless of the vibrational populations@xcite . although one may think that the substructure , specially in the case of very different associated time - scales , does not affect the overall transition , in the strong field case the opposite occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the unpopulated levels of the fine structure induce stark shifts@xcite and create effective detunings from the resonance that limit the extent of the rabi oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> that is , assuming that all the different sublevels are dipole allowed , regardless of the strength of the pulse , the maximum population that can be reached is typically much smaller than one .    </S>",
    "<S> a simple theoretical model explains this observation . </S>",
    "<S> let us first assume that the different sublevels within each manifold are degenerate , @xmath0 , and that all transient dipoles are equal . </S>",
    "<S> then the equations of motion for every sublevel of the excited manifold @xmath1 , and for every sublevel in the initial manifold @xmath2 , are the same . for a resonant transition : @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rabi frequency . </S>",
    "<S> however , the initial conditions in the manifold @xmath2 , where we assume a single state , @xmath6 , is initially populated , break the symmetry so that three different probability amplitudes describe the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we write , @xmath7 where the prime indicates that the initial state is excluded from the summation in the @xmath8 manifold , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are mean probability amplitudes , which in fact behave _ exactly _ as every sublevel amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we define now the collective excited @xmath11 and raman @xmath12 states @xmath13 @xmath14 which together with the initial state @xmath15 form an orthonormal basis such that @xmath16 with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective hamiltonian in this basis is @xmath20 with simple analytic eigenvalues and eigenvectors ( _ aka _ dressed states ) @xcite . when @xmath21 the wave function dynamics is particularly interesting , with a population in the manifold of excited states given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 is the pulse area , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a maximum of @xmath26% population can reach the excited state , whereas there is rabi flopping ( at twice the period of oscillation ) between the initial state @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 _ i.e. _ there is a very efficient raman stokes transition . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of sublevels in the initial manifold only blocks the population transfer more efficiently . for large @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a population in the excited manifold of @xmath32 unlike in @xmath21 , for large @xmath31 the maximum raman populations depend also on @xmath33 . larger pulse areas only increase the frequency of the oscillations , but the initial state is mostly decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> the population dynamics behave as in an off - resonant excitation , with an effective detuning created by the autler - townes splitting@xcite between the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states , coupled by an @xmath34 stronger rabi frequency than the initial state with the @xmath11 state .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath35 ) , ( b ) @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the pulse area is @xmath38 and the energy difference between the levels is @xmath39.,width=245 ]    fig.1 shows the population dynamics for different sublevel structures , using time - scaled units . </S>",
    "<S> case 1 refers to @xmath21 , @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the bandwidth of the gaussian pulse , with scaled width , @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and the peak rabi frequency is @xmath44 . in case 2 </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath45 with the same energy splitting and pulse parameters as before . </S>",
    "<S> the results show ( i ) efficient raman transfer for the first case and ( ii ) population locking in the second case , qualitatively in agreement with eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) even for non - degenerate structures . the main effect provoked by the energy splittings is to allow more population flow to the most excited sublevels of the initial and final manifolds , because the energy difference partially off - sets the effective detuning . </S>",
    "<S> but the effect is too small to qualitatively change the dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to optimize the pulse parameters to increase the efficiency of the population transfer ? </S>",
    "<S> clearly , as long as the initial state is a single sublevel eq.([pe ] ) limits the maximum population that can be transferred using transformed - limited pulses . </S>",
    "<S> the control requires manipulation of the initial wave function . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that the initial manifold can be manipulated before @xmath5 acts such that we have full controllability within a given subset of states . </S>",
    "<S> typically this requires the use of laser pulses of very different frequencies . in molecular physics , several control schemes </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed that imply creating coherences in the initial electronic state by means of infrared pulses before the optical field is used@xcite . however , instead of explicitly finding these pulses , in this work we will develop a geometrical approach .    </S>",
    "<S> we want to maximize the population on the final manifold at time @xmath46 , given by the functional @xmath47 , @xmath48 for fixed @xmath5 , with respect to changes in the initial wave function @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the initial time . </S>",
    "<S> this amounts to finding @xmath51 . instead of explicitly finding the new field , we assume controllability and use a variational approach to simply obtain the rotation matrix @xmath52 ( where the sum can be constrained to a subset of the levels of the initial manifold , _ i.e. _ @xmath53 ) such that @xmath47 is maximal </S>",
    "<S> . we therefore substitute @xmath49 by @xmath54 in eq.([fop ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optimization is purely geometrical and one can use the rayleigh - ritz approach . thus we construct the matrix @xmath55 with elements @xmath56 restricting @xmath54 to be normalized ( equivalently , @xmath57 to be unitary ) we obtain the secular equation , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are the eigenvectors of @xmath55 which give the yields of population transfer @xmath59 .     and ( b ) @xmath60 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> dotted lines represent results for degenerate structures while solid lines give results for structures with energy spacings @xmath39.,width=302 ]    in fig.2 we compare the results of the optimization with the yields obtained from the initial state @xmath27 for degenerate structures @xmath62 and with constant energy spacing between adjacent levels @xmath39 , for two different manifolds , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the optimal yields for degenerate structures follow the pattern of rabi oscillations coinciding with the population transfer from the initial state , but with full population transfer at multiples of @xmath65 of the pulse area . </S>",
    "<S> for non - degenerate structures the minima of these oscillations does not drop to zero but _ increases _ with the number of levels , despite the @xmath66 factor in eq.([pe ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to analyze generic features of the optimized initial states . </S>",
    "<S> when the extended pulse area @xmath67 is an odd multiple of @xmath65 , the optimal initial states have a very clear structure : all their coefficients are equal . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be explained analytically for the degenerate structure , following exactly the same steps as in eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we now define @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the mean amplitude of all @xmath70 initially populated levels in the initial manifold , whereas @xmath71 is the set of unoccupied states . together with the previously defined @xmath12 and @xmath11 collective states , the collective initial state @xmath72 forms </S>",
    "<S> a orthonormal set such that the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath73 with the same eigenvalues as before . </S>",
    "<S> given the wave function @xmath74 with @xmath75 , the probability of reaching the excited manifold is @xmath76 whenever @xmath77 is an odd multiple of @xmath65 , full population inversion can be achieved if _ all _ the sublevels of the initial manifold are equally populated and _ in phase_. for different energy spacings other choices of phases and populations give better results , but the populations are always almost equal . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to proof that when the initial probability amplitudes are all _ out of phase _ </S>",
    "<S> ( such that @xmath78 ) then @xmath47 is minimized and perfect transparency can be achieved , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the population in the excited manifold is zero at all times@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained with nondegenerate structures although the transparency is no longer perfect . since there are many more possible solutions that minimize the yield ( exactly @xmath79 orthogonal eigenvectors for the degenerate structure ) than those that maximize the yield ( a single solution for the degenerate case ) the set of eigenvalues fills from below and the subspace of population transfer is of very small dimension . from the point of view of quantum controllability , population transfer is a difficult problem . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , other yields greather than zero can be achieved when @xmath80 .     and fixed @xmath39 . in ( a ) @xmath81 ( dotted line ) , @xmath82 ( green line ) , @xmath83 ( orange line ) . in ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> we show how the first and second minima of the optimized yield increases with @xmath31 . as shown in ( a ) </S>",
    "<S> , the first minima for @xmath84 occurs practically at the first maxima for smaller @xmath31.,width=359 ]    we now return to the original question : do quantum structures help to control the dynamics ? for population inversion between two manifolds , </S>",
    "<S> the problem is easily controllable by means of proper rabi oscillations in the simplest case , with @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a substructure creates an effective detuning that reduces the oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the larger the energy spacing @xmath86 is , the smaller the back - effect of the unpopulated states and the more the system resembles a simple @xmath87-level system . </S>",
    "<S> however , by manipulating the state within the initial substructure one can regain full rabi oscillations and reach a regime where the pulse area theorem is overcome with almost full controllability regardless of the pulse area for very large @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(a ) shows how the optimized yield with respect to changes in the initial state practically achieves full population inversion whenever @xmath88 is large . </S>",
    "<S> fig.3(b ) shows how the first ( and second ) minima of the optimal yield increase with @xmath31 . only in the degenerate case @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> does not play any role and the dynamics is less controllable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the extended area increases with the number of sublevels , population inversion can be achieved with relatively weak pulses@xcite . in the given example , with @xmath89 , full inversion is obtained already with a pulse area of @xmath90 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of parallel transfer .     </S>",
    "<S> sublevels with control on different subsets of the initial state , @xmath91.,width=302 ]    on the other hand , one should remember that the ability to optimize the yield with increasing @xmath31 ( for fixed @xmath86 ) is at the expense of a finer optimization of the initial state , where the optimal solution is typically a single one , while the `` robust '' subspace of near - zero eigenvalues occupies practically all the space of solutions . </S>",
    "<S> what happens when the dimensionality of the subspace that is controlled is smaller than the space that is initially accesible or , in other words , how are the solutions deteriorated when @xmath92 ? </S>",
    "<S> in fig.4 we show the yield of population transfer as a function of the pulse area for different `` control subspaces '' . now </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 but the controller has only access to the first @xmath91 sublevels ( or to the odd numbered sublevels , due to _ e.g. _ a unspecified selection rule or symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath93 gives maximum yield while @xmath94 implies no control over the initial state . </S>",
    "<S> the yields are deteriorated as the ability to control the system decreases and this effect can not be overcome by increasing the pulse area . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> often best results are often obtained with @xmath95 . moreover , adding external constraints , such as access to only odd number of levels , returns lower values of the yields .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that quantum substructures may hamper the success of population transfer in multi - level systems . by engineering the initial state </S>",
    "<S> one can avoid the detrimental effects and partially correct the rabi oscillations of the yield forced by the pulse area theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this is not achieved by brute force ( increasing the pulse areas ) but by preparing quantum superposition states that cancel the detrimental raman transitions and lead to parallel transfer . </S>",
    "<S> full population blockade and in fact laser induced transparency can also be achieved in similar manners . </S>",
    "<S> the control over the dynamics increases with the ability to manipulate every sublevel of the quantum substructure and is substantially reduced when there is limited control over the sublevels . </S>"
