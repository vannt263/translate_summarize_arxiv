    "chain polymers carrying electro - negative atoms ( e.g. oxygen or nitrogen ) in their repeat unit can act as solvents for certain salts .",
    "well - known examples are li - salts dissolved in polyethylene - oxide ( peo ) . at temperatures sufficiently above the glass - transition temperature these polymer - salt solutions",
    "show significant dc ionic @xmath0 conductivities .",
    "such `` polymer electrolytes '' offer widespread applications in batteries , sensors and fuel cells . from the scientific point of view",
    ", an important goal is to improve our understanding of the electrical conduction mechanism in polymer electrolytes , and in particular to elucidate the interplay between ion diffusion and the polymer network dynamics .",
    "dynamic monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the diffusion coefficient of few particles ( ions ) in a rearranging environment of polymer chains is hampered by the need to move every monomer ( polymer bead or ion ) with the same probability .",
    "therefore most of the computational time is spent moving the polymeric host without affecting the ionic configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "earlier studies indicate that important features of the ion diffusion within a dynamical matrix of chain molecules can be described by a more coarse - grained model@xcite .",
    "the idea is to map the diffusion process onto dbp - theory @xcite and to determine the central quantity entering this theory , the renewal time distribution @xmath1 , from the time dependence of the local occupational correlation function due to the polymer chain dynamics . in this communication",
    "we perform tests of such a procedure for a hard - core lattice gas and for tracer diffusion in systems of athermal lattice polymers .",
    "it turns out that the dbp - concept compares favourably with simulations of the complete system dynamics and thereby saves about one order of magnitude in computer time .",
    "in order to explain our procedure we treat the simple case of a hard - core lattice gas , i.e. point particles moving on a lattice with no interaction besides hard core repulsion . the tracer diffusion constant @xmath2 as a function of concentration @xmath3 is known to a high degree of accuracy via dynamic pair approximations @xcite which yield a tracer correlation factor @xmath4{\\langle}\\cos\\theta    { \\rangle}},\\ ] ] with @xmath5 for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "now we consider a lattice with static disorder in which randomly chosen sites are blocked and thus not accessible for the tracer particle .",
    "for this standard percolation problem we denote the mean square displacement of the tracer by @xmath6 .",
    "if on the other hand the blocked sites are globally and instantaneously rearranged according to an arbitrary waiting - time distribution @xmath1 , generalized dbp - theory yields the following diffusivity at zero frequency in @xmath7 dimensions @xcite @xmath8    our aim is to map the complete system of coupled ions and lattice chains onto this coarse - grained dbp - model . while @xmath6 can be obtained in a straightforward manner from simulations of ion diffusion in the frozen network , the determination of @xmath1 requires more explanation . within the spirit of previous work on the hard - core lattice gas we propose to determine @xmath1 from the local occupational correlation function @xmath9 of a site i adjacent to a fixed tracer position",
    "let us introduce the probability @xmath10 that no renewal takes place within the time interval @xmath11 $ ] after a previous renewal at an arbitrary @xmath12 .",
    "the joint probability @xmath13 that the lattice point @xmath14 is occupied at @xmath15 and at @xmath16 ( not necessarily by the same particle ) consists of two distinct contributions .",
    "the first one is the probability that @xmath14 is occupied at @xmath15 and that no renewal occurs until @xmath16 , which is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the second contribution describes the situation where one or more renewals have taken place until @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding probability is given by @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath10 is related to @xmath13 via @xmath19 according to @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the mean renewal time .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2 ] ) thus can be rewritten as @xmath22 where we obtain @xmath10 from ( [ eq:3 ] ) by means of mc simulations for @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting @xmath10 can be fitted with sufficient accuracy by a combination of @xmath24 exponential functions , @xmath25 on the other hand , @xmath26 can by expressed in terms of the simulated mean square displacement @xmath27 of a tracer particle making @xmath28 steps in a frozen network via @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the attempt frequency of the tracer . inserting ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) into ( [ eq:4 ] ) and carrying out the integration one gets @xmath31 independent calculations for @xmath32 showed that in order to keep the error caused by the finiteness of @xmath33 and @xmath34 below the statistical error , values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 were sufficient .",
    "note that the main decay of @xmath10 is roughly represented by a single exponential with decay rate @xmath37 .    in figure ( [ fig:1 ] )",
    "we compare the results of this theory with mc simulations ( see also @xcite ) and the dynamic pair approximation equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) and also with an existing effective medium approximation ( ema ) for a percolating lattice renewing itself with only one rate constant @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "as one can see , using more than one rate constant in the representation of @xmath10 according to ( [ eq:5 ] ) improves the results significantly .",
    "this observation suggests to apply the generalized dbp - theory to the situation described in the next section where the non - exponential character of the renewal process is even more pronounced .",
    "in the case of a hard - core lattice gas the procedure described bears no computational advantage over existing methods but was merely considered as a test case .",
    "the situation changes , however , when we apply our approach to ion diffusion in a polymer network . no analytic approximations for @xmath2 of a quality similar to ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    "are available then , and full simulations of @xmath39 become much more demanding because of the internal degrees of freedom of the host molecules and the larger statistical errors connected with the small concentration of tracer particles .",
    "let us consider , for example , a system where the chains are made of ten beads , assigned to lattice sites , and linearly connected via nearest - neighbour bonds .",
    "apart from site exclusion , which mimics a hard  core repulsion , no explicit interactions between beads are assumed .",
    "the size of the simulation box is @xmath40 and periodic boundary conditions in all directions are employed . for the chain dynamics we use the standard algorithm as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , while point - particles individually perform nearest - neighbour hops .    to apply our theory we again determine @xmath10 in analogy to the hard - core lattice gas , see ( [ eq:5 ] ) , which is now highly non - exponential , indicating the importance of temporal correlations in the associated renewal processes . a superposition of three exponential functions in ( [ eq:5 ] )",
    ", however , still gives a good description of @xmath10 .",
    "mean - square displacements @xmath27 of ions within a frozen network of chains are determined using @xmath41 steps , and the diffusion constant is calculated as before via equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) . in fig.([fig:2 ] ) we compare our results for the tracer correlation factor as a function of the total concentration of occupied sites , c , with full mc simulations .",
    "due to the connectivity of chains blocking effects at a given @xmath3 on average are reduced and the correlation factor @xmath42 is larger than in the case of point particles , at least as long as @xmath43 .",
    "more important from the computational point of view is the fact that dbp - theory very well agrees with the full simulations , but saves about one order of magnitude in computer time .",
    "mapping that problem onto a coarse - grained dbp - model thus appears to constitute an accurate and efficient method for investigating diffusion through a dynamic host of chain molecules . to support this conclusion further work",
    "is being carried out , in particular under varying chain lengths .",
