    "as the first strong inelastic threshold of the nucleon  nucleon system , pion production in @xmath1 collisions has attracted a large number of theoretical as well as experimental works . due to advances in the experimental methods measurements in the threshold region became possible in the beginning of the 1990ies , and it quickly became clear that the theoretical models existing at the time  @xcite were not able to describe these data  see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "they fell short by a factor of two for reactions with an isoscalar @xmath1 pair in the final state , while there was a discrepancy of even more than an order of magnitude for those with an isovector @xmath1 pair in the final state .",
    "the numerous efforts to improve the phenomenological approaches  @xcite , although quite successful for various observables  @xcite , did lack for systematics , gave contradictory answers , and involved a sensitivity to unobservable short range effects .    to overcome those deficiencies , in recent years considerable theoretical efforts went into the development of an effective field theory that can be applied to the reactions @xmath2 . in early studies it became clear , however , that the original power counting by weinberg  @xcite needs modifications in order to arrive at a convergent expansion  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where it was pointed out that the naive power counting using the heavy baryon formalism is not applicable above the pion production threshold  the necessary adaptions are outlined in ref .",
    "indeed , for neutral pion production in @xmath3 collisions , the corrections due to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) increased the discrepancy with the data and , moreover , the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) contributions turned out to be even larger than the nlo terms  @xcite .",
    "the origin of these difficulties was identified quite early by cohen et al .",
    "@xcite , see also  @xcite , who stressed that the additional new scale , inherent in reactions of the type of @xmath2 , needs to be accounted for in the power counting . since the two nucleons in the initial state need to have sufficiently high kinetic energy to produce the on - shell pion in the final state , the initial center - of - mass momentum needs to be larger than @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to the pion and nucleon mass , respectively , and @xmath7 denotes the typical hadronic scale , here identified with @xmath6 to get a numerical estimate for the expansion parameter . the proper way to include this scale was presented in ref .",

    "@xcite for a review article . as a result",
    "@xmath8-wave pion production is governed by tree - level diagrams up to nnlo @xcite in the modified power counting scheme . on the other hand , for @xmath9-wave pion production , pion loops ,",
    "studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , start to contribute already at nlo .",
    "the individual loop contributions turned out to grow linearly with increasing @xmath1 relative momentum which resulted in a large sensitivity to the employed @xmath1 wave functions  @xcite .",
    "however , it was demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite that all irreducible loop contributions at nlo cancel altogether which was needed to keep the scheme self - consistent . furthermore , the proper separation of irreducible terms at nlo from reducible ones in the loops resulted in an increase of the most important lo operator for charged pion production , first investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , by a factor of 4/3 .",
    "this increase was sufficient to overcome the apparent discrepancy with the data in the reaction @xmath10 .",
    "the neutral pion channel is more challenging  it still calls for a calculation of subleading loop contributions .",
    "first steps in this direction were taken in refs .",
    "we further emphasize that the @xmath11(1232 ) isobar should be taken into account explicitly as a dynamical degree of freedom  @xcite because the delta - nucleon mass difference , @xmath12 , is also of the order of @xmath13 .",
    "this general argument was confirmed numerically in phenomenological calculations  @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite where the effect of the @xmath11 in @xmath14 was studied within chpt .",
    "the progress in the theory of isospin conserving pion production in nucleon - nucleon collisions allowed us to perform a complete leading - order calculation of charge symmetry breaking effects in @xmath15 @xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite for related works .",
    "given the developments just discussed , one now should be in the position to investigate two  pion production in @xmath1 collisions using the same formalism .",
    "such calculations do not exist yet , although in the pioneering works of refs .  @xcite some constraints from chiral symmetry were already implemented .",
    "a more recent phenomenological analysis of this reaction can also be found in ref .  @xcite . for two - pion production in @xmath1 collisions at threshold ,",
    "the center - of - mass momentum of the initial nucleons is necessarily larger by a factor of @xmath16 compared to the single - pion production .",
    "thus we now have p_^(2)= 510  mev  . with this large momentum scale ,",
    "the value of the expansion parameter is = 0.54 and one may question the applicability of chpt for the two - pion production case .",
    "however , while the expansion may converge slowly , it is still meaningful at least close to the chiral limit and therefore should also provide some guideline on the hierarchy of diagrams .",
    "thus it is still interesting and important to investigate the structure of diagrams that contribute at the lowest orders .",
    "note that , since the @xmath1 momentum at the threshold for two - pion production is quite close to the one for single - pion production , for the purpose of power counting below we identify the two .    the amount of experimental data for @xmath17 has increased greatly in recent years  @xcite and even a polarized measurement exists  @xcite .",
    "however , up to now there are no data available sufficiently close to threshold to allow for a straightforward comparison with our leading order calculation of the reaction @xmath18 . to extend our calculation to higher energies the inclusion of the @xmath11 as an explicit degree of freedom will be necessary ( it enters at nlo ) . in addition , at nnlo , besides a large number of loops ,",
    "also the first @xmath17 counterterms start to contribute .",
    "the physics of those is dominated by heavier baryon resonances  most prominently the roper resonance , as follows from previous phenomenological studies of the reactions",
    "@xmath17  @xcite . two pion production and the role of the roper resonance , in particular , has been studied extensively in the single - nucleon sector , namely in the reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 both phenomenologically , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and within chpt @xcite . within chpt",
    "we refer to the calculations at order @xmath21 only , see references cited in @xcite for numerous other studies . ] in particular , chpt studies @xcite predict that the double - neutral - pion photoproduction is significantly enhanced near threshold as compared to the production of the charged pions due to the contribution of chiral ( pion ) loops at nlo ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this prediction was confirmed experimentally in ref .",
    "also it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath11-isobar contribution , which is potentially important because the @xmath22nucleon mass difference is of comparable magnitude to @xmath23 , turns out to be insignificant due to specific cancellations of the individual contributions .",
    "the roper resonance contributes to this process at one order higher , i.e. at n@xmath24lo ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the effect of the roper resonance encoded in low - energy constants was found to be sizable although significantly smaller than the contribution of the leading chiral loops @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions about the role of the roper resonance were drawn based on studies of @xmath20 . in this case , however , the loops were found to be negligible @xcite and the leading contribution was provided by tree level terms . for two - neutral - pion production in @xmath1 collisions",
    "we expect the production mechanism to be in accord with the dimensional analysis , i.e it should be dominated by the tree level graphs at lo .",
    "however , an explicit study of loops at nlo will be necessary to support our uncertainty estimates .    the paper is structured in the following way : in sect .",
    "ii our theoretical framework is introduced .",
    "results for the reaction @xmath26 are presented and discussed in sect .",
    "a summary and some concluding remarks are provided in sect .",
    "technical details of our calculations are summarized in two appendices .",
    "our calculations are based on the effective chiral lagrangian  @xcite : ^(0)&=&[(_)^2 -^2(^)^2]+n^()n + & & + n^(+ ( ) ) n+ + ^(1)&= & ( in^()n+h.c.)-[in^n+h.c . ]",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the system is characterized by three scales , where we use @xmath34 the counting rules here are similar to those for one - pion production used in  @xcite ( for a review see also  @xcite ) . for the weinberg - tomozawa ( wt )",
    "@xmath35 vertex , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the leading term should be proportional to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the energy of the outgoing ( on - shell ) pion .",
    "the diagrams that contribute at the lowest order are shown in fig .",

    "[ feyn_fig1]d ) , we note that the naive dimensional analysis shows that this diagram contributes at next  to  leading order .",
    "however , due to the existence of the two  nucleon cut in the intermediate state , this diagram is promoted to leading order following the very same logic adopted by weinberg  @xcite . in addition , fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1 ] e)i ) show genuine two  pion production diagrams .",
    "note that the only non  resonant diagrams included in the earlier studies of refs .",
    "@xcite are those depicted in the second line of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1 ] , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite such diagrams are not considered at all .",
    "another potentially important class of contributions arises from diagrams where one of the nucleons is excited to the @xmath39-resonance .",
    "however , in the reaction considered here the @xmath40 system can only couple to the @xmath1 system in the intermediate state .",
    "the @xmath1 systems in the initial and final states have to have isospin zero , cf .",
    "below , while the @xmath40 system has always isospin one .",
    "the @xmath39 can only appear when the first pion is emitted and , thus , the power counting for the @xmath39 in @xmath18 is similar to the one in single - pion production .",
    "in particular , the @xmath39 starts to contribute at nlo due to the fact that the @xmath11 propagator is suppressed by @xmath41 as compared to 1/@xmath5 in the nucleon case .",
    "moreover , the aforementioned isospin arguments prevent the potentially dangerous situation when there is an extremely enhanced @xmath11-propagator @xmath42 in the @xmath40 intermediate state that would occur from a @xmath11 excitation prior to the first pion emission .",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar observation was made in ref .",
    "@xcite in the reaction @xmath19 where the corresponding term @xmath43 did not show up in the denominator because of an exact cancellation with the same term in the numerator .",
    "once the production operators are constructed , they should be convoluted with @xmath1 wave functions to account for the nonperturbative character of @xmath1 interaction  @xcite . in principle",
    ", the @xmath1 wave functions should be calculated on the same basis as the production operators . however , up to now chpt @xmath1 interactions are only available for energies below the one - pion production threshold  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work we adopt the so - called hybrid approach that consists in the convolution of the production operator calculated within chpt with phenomenological @xmath1 wave functions from realistic @xmath1 models , in particular from the ccf model  @xcite .",
    "we utilize also wave functions generated from the cd - bonn @xmath1 potential @xcite so that we can examine in how far our results depend on the specific choice of the @xmath1 wave functions .",
    "the @xmath39 resonance is included as explicit degree of freedom in the construction of the ccf potential  @xcite as well as in an extended version of the cd - bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "this will allow us to extend in a future work the present calculation to higher orders in a straightforward manner .",
    "the ellipses in the feynman diagrams of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1 ] refer to the @xmath1 wave functions and represent either the initial state interaction  ( isi ) or the intermediate state interaction  ( imsi ) of nucleon pairs supplemented with the plane wave terms .",
    "based on the lagrangian given above , it is straightforward to calculate the amplitudes corresponding to the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1 ] . furthermore , since we are only interested in the energy region very near to threshold , only a few partial waves contribute to the reaction amplitude . at threshold ,",
    "the @xmath44 system is in a relative s - wave and its isospin can be either zero or two as required by the symmetry of a system of identical bosons .",
    "however , since the isospin of the initial @xmath1 system can only be zero or one and the deuteron is an isosinglet the isospin of the produced @xmath44 pair has to be zero and , consequently , also the isospin of the initial @xmath1 state is zero .",
    "then the conservation of parity and angular momentum further requires that the total angular momentum of the system should be one and the @xmath1 pair in the initial state can only be in the @xmath45 or @xmath46 partial waves .",
    "the pauli principle is also satisfied in this case .",
    "the explicit expressions for the amplitudes of these two partial waves can be found in appendix a.",
    "[ fullamp ]    .values of the individual amplitudes for the @xmath45 partial wave ( in @xmath47mev@xmath48 ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as discussed in the introduction , some leading order diagrams depicted in figs .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]a)-  [ feyn_fig1]e ) are missing in ref .",
    "first , we want to discuss the role of the diagrams  [ feyn_fig1]a)-  [ feyn_fig1]d ) .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , these diagrams are closely related to the one - pion production case . there",
    "the leading order contributions come from the direct pion emission and the rescattering term .",
    "thus , one may expect that the amplitudes  [ feyn_fig1]a)-  [ feyn_fig1]d ) reveal a pattern similar to the one - pion production case .",
    "for example , one may guess that the amplitude of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]a ) should be much smaller than the one of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]b ) due to the fact that for single - pion production the rescattering term dominates over the direct one by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , it should be noted that in our case the @xmath1 amplitude in the intermediate state is fully off - shell and it turns out that the real part of diagram b ) is larger only by a factor of about 3 as compared to the one of diagram a )  cf .",
    "table  [ fullamp ] .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that the @xmath1 amplitudes for the isi appear in coupled channels ( @xmath45-@xmath46 ) the production amplitudes , as given in table  [ fullamp ] , do not have the same phase .",
    "this fact makes the interference between the individual amplitudes very different from the one - pion production case and a direct comparison becomes difficult .",
    "the role of the @xmath1 interaction in the initial and intermediate states can be understood from looking at the individual contributions to the two - pion production amplitudes listed in tables  [ 3s1 ] and  [ 3d1 ] .",
    "we find that the values of these contributions are basically comparable with each other , as expected from the power counting .",
    "the values of the amplitudes of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]b ) and fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]d ) are about a factor of two to three larger than the other two amplitudes [ feyn_fig1]a ) and [ feyn_fig1]c ) , which is still a reflection of the dynamics governing the one - pion production .",
    "we observe that the resulting values of the amplitudes  [ feyn_fig1]a)-  [ feyn_fig1]d ) are similar in size to those of  [ feyn_fig1]f)-  [ feyn_fig1]i ) considered in previous studies @xcite and , thus , are important .",
    "we also find that the @xmath1 interaction in the initial and intermediate states plays an important role in the calculation , especially for the diagrams  [ feyn_fig1]a)-  [ feyn_fig1]d ) .",
    "in particular , one can find from tables  [ 3s1 ] and [ 3d1 ] that the inclusion of the @xmath1 interaction in the isi or the imsi generally reduces the magnitude of the amplitudes as compared to the born amplitude and that the cancellation among the individual amplitudes of each particular diagram is significant .",
    "the largest cancellation takes place between the amplitudes with and without the imsi , i.e. between ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) and ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) where the amplitudes are defined in appendix a , see also tables  [ 3s1 ] and [ 3d1 ] . for example , the value of the s - wave amplitude of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]a ) becomes a factor of two smaller than the born amplitude after including the isi .",
    "when the imsi is also considered , the full amplitude is further reduced so that it is finally a factor of six smaller than the born amplitude .",
    "this observation shows explicitly that the isi and the imsi are very important quantitatively . since they also strongly influence the phase of the amplitudes , their proper inclusion is compulsory , especially for studies of polarization observables .    the strength of the contact terms , that appear in fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]e ) , is given by the low energy constants @xmath53 that can be determined from @xmath54 scattering . because we are only interested in the amplitudes at threshold , we only need the values of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in this work , we take the values from ref .",
    "@xcite where the values of @xmath53 s are obtained by fitting @xmath54 threshold parameters . to the order we are working ,",
    "three solutions are offered in that paper .",
    "one corresponds to the results without considering the @xmath39 explicitly , and the other two are results where the @xmath39 is included but with different choices of the @xmath58 coupling constant @xmath59 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be largely accounted for by the contribution from the @xmath39  @xcite , and therefore the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can change significantly between extractions with and without inclusion of the @xmath39 . one may expect that using different sets of parameters will affect the value of the amplitudes of fig .  [ feyn_fig1]e ) strongly .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the amplitude of fig .",
    "[ feyn_fig1]e ) is independent of those choices , because it only depends on the value of the linear combination @xmath60 with @xmath61 for the pion energies in the kinematics relevant here . from table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite one can see that the values of @xmath55 and @xmath62 are not affected by the @xmath39 up to order @xmath63 .",
    "thus , although the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can significantly change individually by considering the @xmath39 explicitly , the sum of them is not affected up to order @xmath63 , as shown explicitly in ref .",
    "hence at lo the contribution from contact terms are not influenced by the @xmath39 , which is also consistent with the power counting used .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the linear combination of low energy parameters displayed in eq .",
    "( [ cicomb ] ) is large , for the individual terms interfere constructively  this is in contradistinction to @xmath54 scattering , where @xmath64 holds at threshold and then physics is governed by the very small isoscalar scattering length  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent accurate extraction of @xmath65 from pionic atoms .",
    "thus , once the reaction @xmath66 can be studied with sufficient accuracy , it might be a good source of information for the @xmath53 individually .",
    "note also that in ref .",
    "@xcite the 1/@xmath6 corrections are not included explicitly in the fits to @xmath54 data but absorbed effectively into the lecs @xmath53 . to be consistent with their treatment",
    "we also drop the 1/@xmath6 term in eq .",

    "[ feyn_fig1]f)-  [ feyn_fig1]i ) are included in the previous study of ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the initial state interaction which is not considered in that work .",
    "however , as can be seen from tables  [ 3s1 ] and [ 3d1 ] , the consistent inclusion of the isi changes the value of the amplitudes [ feyn_fig1]f)-  [ feyn_fig1]i ) significantly and is thus important .    besides the interference between the individual amplitudes of each particular diagram , the interference between the contributions from different diagrams is also very significant as can be seen from tables  [ 3s1 ] and [ 3d1 ] . in order to examine the sensitivity of our results and especially of the interference pattern to the employed @xmath1 interaction we also performed calculations with a different @xmath1 model , namely with the cd - bonn model  @xcite .",
    "we found that the values of the individual amplitudes vary in a reasonable range ( up to 30% ) due to differences in the @xmath1 wave functions whereas the sum of all amplitudes varies just by a small amount ( around 10% ) .",
    "this variation should be partly absorbed by the contribution of the @xmath68 contact term at n@xmath24lo .",
    "based on the assumption of a constant production amplitude .",
    "the shaded area corresponds to the uncertainty estimate based on a dimensional analysis . ]    to check the convergence of chiral expansions based on counting rules , it is necessary to calculate explicitly subleading contributions .",
    "as those calculations are not available yet , we may try to compare the results from the leading order contributions to experimental observables : our result should be within 50% of the data , given the relatively large value of the expansion parameter .",
    "the applicability of our @xmath9-wave calculation is restricted to the near - threshold regime and , therefore , data close to the threshold are needed for a sensible comparison of theory with experiment .",
    "unfortunately , at present the empirical information for the @xmath69 channel is very scarce .",
    "only data down to excess energies @xmath70 mev ( @xmath71 ) are available and the uncertainties are still very large .",
    "thus , it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the convergence in the present work . in order to provide some comparison of our calculation with the existing data ,",
    "we assume that the matrix element is constant and therefore take the energy dependence as originating only from the three  body phase space .",
    "our result is roughly a factor of two smaller than the central value of the data point at @xmath70 mev .",
    "we want to stress , however , that the uncertainties of the experiment in question is quite large ( even a factor of 25 larger than the data themselves ) . for future reference , in fig .",
    "[ xsec ] we show the central value for the cross section predicted under the assumption that the matrix element is a constant and that no higher partial waves contribute .",
    "we also indicate the uncertainty band based on a dimensional analysis .",
    "we presented a complete leading order calculation for the reaction @xmath66 at threshold within chiral perturbation theory .",
    "there is no free parameter in the calculation at this order .",
    "we included various additional diagrams as compared to previous investigations  @xcite and we also made several technical improvements .",
    "our most important findings , summarized in table  [ fullamp ] , are    * all diagrams evaluated are of similar importance ; * there are sizable interferences between the individual contributions ; * the accurate inclusion of the @xmath1 interaction in both intermediate as well as initial states is very important .",
    "we also stress that for two  pion production the expansion parameter @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the initial @xmath1 momentum at the two - pion production threshold , is rather large .",
    "it is therefore important to calculate higher order contributions to check the rate of convergence .",
    "we argue in this paper that despite of the proximity of the @xmath39 to the @xmath74 threshold the potentially most important @xmath40 intermediate state is not allowed for the reaction @xmath18 because of isospin conservation .",
    "intermediate states containing the @xmath39 must be of the kind @xmath58 , i.e. can only occur after one - pion emission .",
    "therefore , the role of the @xmath39 resonance in the reaction considered is expected to be analogous to that in one - pion production . in particular",
    ", the @xmath39 starts to contribute at next - to - leading order .",
    "furthermore , it is known from phenomenological studies of @xmath17  @xcite that the roper resonance can play a significant role already near threshold and that it will become even more important when considering a larger range of energies .",
    "however , this resonance is not included explicitly in the present study .",
    "one may expect that its contribution is absorbed into some low energy constants .",
    "the contribution of the roper resonance to the @xmath53 parameters , that scale the strength of the leading isoscalar @xmath30n scattering , has been discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "it seems that it plays only a minor role here .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn from systematic studies within chpt of the double - pion photoproduction process @xcite and the reaction @xmath75 @xcite near threshold .",
    "in particular , for the reaction @xmath76 the contribution of the roper was found to be rather moderate as compared to the large contribution of chiral loops @xcite . a recent model calculation of @xmath20 by s.  schneider et al .",
    "@xcite suggests also that the roper resonance plays a rather minor role . on the other hand ,",
    "the roper might contribute significantly to the @xmath68 counterterms , which enter at nnlo in a chpt calculation of @xmath17 .",
    "based on the discussions above , one can not expect that our current calculation can describe the experimental data well at higher energies .",
    "however , the presented calculation provides an estimate for the contribution of the non  resonant background near threshold .",
