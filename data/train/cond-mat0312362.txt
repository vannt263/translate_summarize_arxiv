    "the superfluid phases in @xmath0he have been extensively studied in the years @xcite . in the absence of magnetic field two superfluid phases , named a and b respectively , have been identified . however , if one takes into account the weak dipolar interaction @xcite , a new phase , called planar phase , should separate the normal state from the a and b superfluid states @xcite . at present",
    ", there is no experimental evidence for a normal - to - planar transition .",
    "this is due to the fact that dipolar interactions are expected to become relevant only within the interval @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . for pressures between 10 and 30 bar ,",
    "@xmath10 varies between 2 and 2.6 mk , so that the interesting temperature interval is approximately @xmath11 ( 4 - 5)@xmath12 k. outside this interval normal fermi liquid or a / b superfluid behavior should be observed . despite the narrowness of such temperature interval , ref .",
    "@xcite argued that it should be possible to observe the planar phase if the temperature @xmath13 can be controlled to high precision , as it has been done recently for @xmath14he @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate its nature in detail .    the normal - to - superfluid transition in @xmath0he is supposed to be driven by @xmath15-wave spin - triplet pairing states . near the transition",
    "the critical behavior is controlled by an order parameter that is a complex 3@xmath163 matrix , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the weak dipolar interaction breaks the original so(3)@xmath16so(3)@xmath16u(1 ) symmetry down to so(3)@xmath16u(1 ) and the corresponding order parameter becomes a complex three - component field @xmath17 .",
    "if we neglect strain gradient effects @xcite , which are expected to be irrelevant at the transition @xcite , the landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian describing the critical modes at the normal - to - planar transition can be written as @xcite @xmath18 , \\label{lgwpsi}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "approximate estimates @xcite give @xmath21 . note that stability requires @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath20 the hamiltonian is minimized by fields @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a constant real vector , and the corresponding ground - state manifold is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath28-dimensional sphere .",
    "the case @xmath29 with a two - component and a three - component field @xmath17 is also physically interesting because it describes the critical properties of frustrated spin models with noncollinear order @xcite .",
    "the same hamiltonian has also been considered to discuss the critical properties of mott insulators @xcite .",
    "it should also be relevant for two - dimensional quantum phase transitions in cuprate superconductors @xcite and for transitions in heavy - fermion compounds such as upt@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in the mean - field approximation the model with hamiltonian ( [ lgwpsi ] ) has a continuous second - order transition .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1-expansion calculations for an @xmath31-component field @xmath17 find @xcite a stable fixed point ( fp ) in the region @xmath20 only for @xmath32 , @xmath33 . apparently no fp is found for @xmath34 , suggesting a fluctuation - induced first - order transition .",
    "this scenario has been further supported by three - loop calculations within a three - dimensional ( 3-@xmath35 ) massive zero - momentum ( mzm ) scheme @xcite and by a nonperturbative renormalization - group ( rg ) study of the effective average action in the lowest - order approximation of the derivative expansion @xcite . as we shall argue below mentioning a few specific physical examples , these results may not be conclusive .",
    "for instance , in some physically interesting cases , low - order , and in some cases also high - order , @xmath1-expansion calculations fail to provide the correct physical picture .",
    "the location and the stability of the fp s may drastically change approaching @xmath36 , and new fp s , not present for @xmath37 , may appear in three dimensions .",
    "we mention the ginzburg - landau model of superconductors , in which a complex scalar field couples to a gauge field .",
    "one - loop @xmath1-expansion calculations @xcite indicate that no stable fp exists unless the number @xmath31 of real components of the scalar field is larger than @xmath38 .",
    "this number is much larger than the physical value @xmath39 .",
    "consequently , a first - order transition was always expected @xcite . later , exploiting 3-@xmath35 theoretical approaches ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and monte carlo simulations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it was realized that 3-@xmath35 systems described by the ginzburg - landau model can also undergo a continuous transition  this implies the presence of a stable fp in the 3-@xmath35 ginzburg - landau theory  in agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon probably occurs  but this is still a controversial issue , see , e.g. , refs .",

    "two different renormalization schemes were used : the mzm scheme ( six loops ) @xcite and the minimal - subtraction ( @xmath43 ) scheme without @xmath1 expansion ( five loops ) @xcite .",
    "these results confirm the existence of a new chiral universality class and are in agreement with most experiments that observe continuous transitions in stacked triangular antiferromagnets @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the nature of the normal - to - planar transition in @xmath0he by exploiting two different 3-@xmath35 perturbative field - theoretical approaches based on the hamiltonian ( [ lgwpsi ] ) .",
    "the first one , the mzm scheme , is defined in the massive ( disordered ) phase @xcite .",
    "it is based on a zero - momentum renormalization procedure and an expansion in powers of zero - momentum quartic couplings .",
    "as already mentioned , this perturbative scheme was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where three - loop series were analyzed without finding evidence for stable fp s .",
    "the second scheme is the so - called @xmath43 scheme without @xmath1 expansion @xcite , which is defined in the massless critical theory .",
    "this scheme is strictly related to the @xmath1 expansion , but , unlike it , no expansion in powers of @xmath1 is performed .",
    "indeed , @xmath1 is set to its physical value @xmath44 , and one analyzes the expansions in powers of the renormalized quartic couplings .    here",
    "we shall present an analysis of the six - loop mzm series that have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and of the five - loop @xmath43 series that have been computed in ref .",
    "we find a stable fp in the region @xmath45 whose attraction domain includes the region where @xmath46 , which should be the relevant one for the transition in @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "the two perturbative schemes give consistent results , providing a nontrivial crosscheck of the results .",
    "we thus predict a continuous normal - to - planar transition , belonging to a new universality class .",
    "our result contradicts earlier theoretical works , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also determine the standard critical exponents for model ( [ lgwpsi ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 in the mzm scheme and @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the @xmath43 scheme .",
    "a weighted average gives @xmath55 the errors are such to include the mzm results ( with their errors ) that apparently are the most precise ones . by using hyperscaling",
    "we also obtain @xmath3 .",
    "note that , while @xmath56 and @xmath2 are indeed the critical exponents associated with the specific heat and with the correlation length , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are not directly accessible in @xmath0he and are _ not _ related with the magnetic critical behavior of @xmath0he .",
    "indeed , the operator that couples with the external magnetic field in @xmath0he is the so - called chiral operator @xcite @xmath60 .",
    "we compute the exponents @xmath4 and @xmath5 that characterize the singular behavior of the magnetic susceptibility and of the magnetization , and @xmath61 , related to the large - momentum behavior of the magnetic structure factor ( in field - theoretical terms it is defined in terms of the fourier transform of @xmath62 that behaves as @xmath63 for large momenta @xmath64 ) .",
    "we find @xmath65 , @xmath6 , @xmath66 in the mzm scheme and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 in the minimal - subtraction scheme .",
    "a weighted average gives @xmath70 where the errors have been computed as before .",
    "note that @xmath4 is negative so that in the high - temperature phase the analytic background gives the dominant contribution to the magnetic susceptibility @xmath71 .",
    "close to @xmath10 , we have therefore @xmath72 . in the low - temperature phase instead",
    "@xmath71 is infinite due to the presence of goldstone modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the analysis of the six - loop series in the mzm scheme .",

    "this result is fully confirmed by the analysis of the five - loop series in the massless @xmath43 scheme that is presented in sec .",
    "we report the perturbative expansions analyzed here in the mzm and @xmath43 schemes in app .",

    "@xcite . in app .",
    "[ appgexp ] we report the series for the relevant case @xmath34 .",

    "the expansion is not borel summable . however , if the condition @xmath82 holds , then the singularity of the borel transform that is closest to the origin is still in the negative axis .",

    "@xcite provided a rather robust evidence of the presence of a stable fp with @xmath92 and attraction domain in the region @xmath29 , at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "we shall now show that the rg flow obtained by resumming the six - loop @xmath59-functions provides a rather robust evidence for another stable fp in the region @xmath45 with attraction domain including the region @xmath21 , which should be the relevant one for the @xmath0he superfluid transition .    in order to investigate the rg flow in the region @xmath20",

    "where the error bars correspond to 2 standard deviations .",
    "all zeros of the approximants with @xmath111 and @xmath112 lie within half of the reported confidence interval and only a few with @xmath113 give significantly different estimates for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
