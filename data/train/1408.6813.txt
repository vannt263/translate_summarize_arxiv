    "the goal of this paper is to compare the speed of gravity with the speed of light within general relativity . in this section",
    "we discuss a major obstacle in achieving this goal , which is the lack of a suitable  that is physically motivated , but rigorous  definition of the  speed of gravity \" in the general case ( i. e. , say , beyond the linearized theory ) .",
    "without such a definition any answer to the question posed in the title of this paper is obviously meaningless , but the reason for its lack is quite valid : the universe according to relativity is a  motionless \" ,  unchanging \" 4-dimensional object , and gravity is just its shape .",
    "but what can be called the speed of a shape ?",
    "what is the  speed of being a ball \" ?",
    "still , there are situations in which it would be convenient to be able to assign a speed to gravity , or at least to be able to tell whether it is greater / less than the speed of light .",
    "consider , for example , an observer orbiting a red giant .",
    "suppose one day the events @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 happen : @xmath0 is the star exploding as a supernova , @xmath2 is the observer seeing the explosion , and @xmath1 is the observer s equipment showing that the local geometry has drastically changed as a result of the same explosion . the sought - for definitions must allow one to say that the propagation of gravity was superluminal , if @xmath3 [ written also @xmath4 , or @xmath5 , i.  e. if there is a piecewise timelike future directed curve from @xmath2 to @xmath1 .",
    "to put it slightly more mathematically let us write @xmath6 for  @xmath7 gravitationally affects @xmath8 \" or , interchangeably , ",
    "@xmath7 is a ( gravitational ) cause of @xmath8 \" .",
    "then our task is to define the  gravitational cause \" so that the gravitational signalling would be recognized superluminal if and only if there is a pair of points @xmath9 such that @xmath10 even though @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , or @xmath13 means  there is a piecewise nonspacelike future directed curve from @xmath0 to @xmath1 \" . by saying so we , of course , have not solved the problem , but have made it clearer , or so it seems .",
    "all one needs now is to put forward an intuitively acceptable criterion for whether an event acts gravitationally upon another ( in the example with the supernova this fact was hidden in the words  a _ result _ of the same explosion \" ) .",
    "probably the simplest step along these lines is to declare that @xmath10 when and only when the two events can be connected by a piecewise smooth curve  called _ gravitational signal _  defined by a condition imposed on its velocity .",
    "for example , the tangent to the curve might be required to be null , or to obey some constraints involving velocities often mentioned in discussing superluminal signaling by material fields : phase velocity , group velocity , or the velocity of transport of energy . for the gravitational field , however , this approach does not work . in the general case it is even hard to define those quantities , but there is also a more serious reason for the failure .",
    "let us turn for a moment to material fields .    * .",
    "example . *    [ ex : period ] ( i ) consider a minkowski space with a field @xmath14 in it which obeys only the equation @xmath15 where the constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18  are free parameters of the theory .",
    "it is not that simple to justify any particular definition of the signal in this case ( hereafter we shall touch on that ) .",
    "what _ is _ clear in advance , however , is that any _ reasonable _ definition of signals must be satisfied , in particular , by the future directed lightlike broken lines ( otherwise one will have to reinterpret the entire special relativity , with its thought experiments involving essentially the same field ) .",
    "similarly , spacelike separated points must prove to be causally disconnected .",
    "so , for instance , the point @xmath19 with the coordinates @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is affected by the origin of the coordinates , when @xmath24 , but not when @xmath25 .",
    "it is noteworthy that such a choice of the cause - effect relation makes the interpretation of the lines @xmath26 with @xmath27 and with @xmath28 strikingly different .",
    "while the former geodesics are just the world lines of ordinary pointlike charges ( the zero acceleration may mean that their masses are very large ) , the latter ones do not correspond to any particles _ at all_. each point of such a line is causally disconnected from all others .",
    "so instead of propagation of a particle we have a _ process _ which takes place _ independently _ at every point of the line ( cf .  a light spot running along a remote surface @xcite ) and which consists in @xmath14 infinitely growing prior to such a point and falling immediately after its occurrence .",
    "\\(ii ) consider now a theory in which the field @xmath14 obeys the wave equation , but also is subject to an _ additional _ condition of the periodicity in the @xmath8 direction : @xmath29 now whatever information about the origin of coordinates @xmath30 can be inferred from the values at @xmath31 of the field and its derivatives @xmath32 , exactly the same information will be available to an observer who measures @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "so we have to conclude that in _ this _ theory @xmath35 .",
    "there are no reasons whatsoever to believe in periodic fields .",
    "the example is cited only to demonstrate that ( i ) equations of motion alone can not determine the causal structure of a theory .",
    "correspondingly , none of the aforementioned velocities can serve as the signal speed and ( ii ) two events ( @xmath30 and @xmath36 , for instance ) can be causally related ( @xmath37 ) , even though they are not connected by a signal understood as a curve @xmath38 such that @xmath39 in this sense the relation @xmath40 is not quite local .",
    "from the foregoing it appears that one ought to abandon ( at this stage , at least ) the concept of the signal and to define the relation @xmath40 directly from its physical meaning , in the spirit of the preceding examples . in all appearance",
    "the notion of  cause \" will be satisfactorily captured by a relation @xmath40 , if the latter has the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 is a partial order relation .",
    "indeed , it must be transitive ( since the cause of a cause is obviously a cause ) , reflective ( it is just a matter of convention and we choose the analogy with the relation @xmath41 ) , and antisymmetric ( an event different from @xmath2 can not be both a cause and an effect of @xmath2 ) .",
    "2 .   if @xmath42 , then there exists a set @xmath43 such that[prop:2 ] 1 .",
    "@xmath43 determines @xmath44 in the sense that the values taken in @xmath43 by the field and its derivatives @xmath45 , @xmath46 fix uniquely the value @xmath44 ; 2 .",
    "if @xmath47 is a neighbourhood of @xmath2 , then @xmath48 does _ not _ determine @xmath44 .",
    "the requirement [ prop:2 ] is justified by the fact that it is an embodiment of the idea that    1 .",
    "any change in the effect is produced only by a change in some of its causes .",
    "the relation @xmath49 is not defined _ uniquely _ by those properties ; for example , the relation @xmath50 defined by the equivalence @xmath51 presumably also possesses them .",
    "to fix the non - uniqueness one may need an additional convention , which is not surprising : different definitions of the causal order within a given theory account for different views on what is freely specifiable in that theory .",
    "one might wish the above formulated definition to be more strict , but by and large it seems adequate in discussing causal properties of matter fields .",
    "it could be expected that in the gravitational case the cause - effect relation can be introduced in the same manner , one only must take @xmath14 to be the metric .",
    "presumably , it is this conviction that suggests the following simple resolution of the problems considered in this paper : `` the solution [ to the einstein equations ] obtained depends , at a point @xmath7 , only on the initial data within the hypercone of light rays [  ] with vertex @xmath7 , that is , on the relativistic past of that point .",
    "this result confirms the relativistic causality principle as well as the fact that gravitation propagates with the speed of light '' @xcite .",
    "the flaw in this resolution is that  is fixed as a solution of a differential equation by the data within a set @xmath43 \" and  is caused only by points of @xmath43 \" is not the same . in other words ,",
    "the causality relation in the gravitational case may not obey [ prop:2 ] .",
    "this is , in particular , because the principle [ prop:2 ] * does not apply to the metric .",
    "the point is that while for a material field @xmath14 it is quite clear what  a change in @xmath52 \" is , there is no such thing as a  change in the metric at @xmath53 \" . indeed , in considering a spacetime @xmath54 one can give a precise meaning to the words  the geometry of a set @xmath55 has changed \" : they mean that we consider _ another _ spacetime @xmath56 and state that there is a set @xmath57 and an isometry @xmath58 which maps @xmath59 to @xmath60 , but which can not be extended to an isometry mapping the entire @xmath61 to @xmath62",
    ". however , that change can not be resolved into pointwise changes : there is no way , in the general case , to put in correspondence a particular @xmath63 to each @xmath64 ( note that @xmath65 even need not be diffeomorphic to @xmath66 ) so as to compare @xmath67 to @xmath68 and thus to find out whether the metric in @xmath69 has changed .",
    "it is clear from the foregoing that there is no easy way of introducing the relation @xmath40 .",
    "therefore we take a completely different approach .",
    "in this section we formulate conditions which being imposed on a pair of spacetimes @xmath61 and @xmath62 allow one to speak of that pair as describing two different extensions of a _ common prehistory _",
    "( in the example which opens the paper this prehistory would include the life of the red giant prior to the explosion @xmath0 ) . that will enable us to translate the question of whether relativity ( in a broad sense ) admits superluminality of any kind into the question of when the difference between such @xmath61 and @xmath62 is attributable to a certain event and its consequences @xcite .    *",
    ". definition .",
    "*    [ def : alt ] a pair of pointed inextendible spacetimes @xmath70 , @xmath71 is called an _ alternative _ , if there exists a pair of open connected past sets @xmath72 and an isometry @xmath73 which maps @xmath74 to @xmath75 and @xmath76 to @xmath77 ( all matter fields in @xmath74 and @xmath75 are assumed to be tensors related by the same @xmath73 ) .    *",
    ". notation . *    for a given alternative the pair @xmath78 need not be unique . let @xmath79 be the family of all such pairs .",
    "by @xmath80 we shall denote its _ maximal _ element , that is one which is not  smaller \" than any other : @xmath81 correspondingly , @xmath82 .",
    "the existence of @xmath80 follows from zorn s lemma , since the open subsets of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are partially ordered by inclusion @xmath85 and with such an ordering every chain @xmath86 has an upper bound @xmath87 .    *",
    ". comment .",
    "*    [ com : alt ] it is the regions @xmath88 that describe the mentioned prehistory . the requirement that they be isometric is self - obvious .",
    "it is also obvious why both of them must be past sets ( two spacetimes evidently do not describe the same region of the universe , if their inhabitants differ in remembrances ) .",
    "as was explained in the introduction , our main interest is actually _ non_-isometric regions of @xmath89 and we need @xmath90 only as a tool for outlining those regions .",
    "that is why we require @xmath90 to be connected and maximal .",
    "finally , the points @xmath91 describe the event ( the star explosion in the mentioned example ) responsible for splitting the evolution of the universe into the two branches .    *",
    ". definition . *    the sets @xmath92 will be termed _",
    "fronts_. a front @xmath93 is _ superluminal _ , if @xmath94 .",
    "being the boundary of a past set a front is a closed , imbedded , achronal three - dimensional @xmath95 submanifold ( * ? ? ? * proposition 6.3.1 ) . at either @xmath96 the front @xmath97 bounds the region @xmath98 ,",
    "in which , loosely speaking , the remembrances ( concerning the gravitational or material fields ) of every observer differ from what they would remember , if some other event happened in @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret such a difference as evidence that the mentioned observer received a signal from @xmath0 .",
    "correspondingly , when such an observer is located out of @xmath99 the signal is superluminal , hence our definition .",
    "the concept of an alternative is quite rough . in the general case",
    "it does not make it possible to assign a specific speed to a  gravitational signal \" , if by the latter a front is understood .",
    "even the source of the signal can not be determined uniquely : the same pair of spacetimes can satisfy the definition of alternative with different choices of points @xmath100 .",
    "nevertheless , it allows one to formulate a _ necessary _ condition for calling the speed of gravity superluminal .",
    "namely , in considering a particular theory ( i.  e. a set of material fields and their relation to the geometry of the spacetime ) let us single out a class of _ admissible _ alternatives , by which the alternatives are understood consisting of spacetimes @xmath101 such that they are equally possible in that theory and differ only by the events @xmath100 and by the events which we agree to recognize as consequences of @xmath100 ( not as consequences of some primordial difference in the spacetimes ) . if none of the admissible alternatives has a superluminal front we shall acknowledge that the speed of gravity in this theory is bounded by the speed of light .",
    "let us adopt the convention that an alternative @xmath70 in which both spacetimes are globally hyperbolic is admissible , only if there are cauchy surfaces @xmath102 such that @xmath103 and the values of material fields ( and their derivatives , if necessary ) in any @xmath104 are the same as in @xmath105 .",
    "such a criterion does not look far - fetched , for , if there is no such a pair of cauchy surfaces , why should one regard the difference in @xmath61 and @xmath62 as ensuing from what happened in @xmath0 and its consequences , cf .",
    "it rather must be acknowledged as _",
    "primordial_.    the global hyperbolicity of @xmath106 implies the equality @xmath107\\cup\\,{\\mathcal{d}}(\\euscript s_k - s_k),\\ ] ] where @xmath108 denotes the cauchy domain of the set @xmath109 ( i.  e. the set of all points @xmath53 of @xmath89 such that every inextendible nonspacelike curve through @xmath53 meets @xmath110 ) . by the existence and",
    "uniqueness theorem equality of the initial data fixed at initial 3-surfaces implies isometry of the corresponding cauchy domains .",
    "so , if an alternative is admissible , @xmath111 are isometric and hence @xmath112 [ which by definition include @xmath113 include also @xmath114 .",
    "thus , neither of the fronts is superluminal . in this sense general relativity",
    "does prohibit superluminal propagation of the gravitational field : under the formulated above assumptions _ the speed of a gravitational signal does not exceed the speed of light_.    * . remark .",
    "*    the approach developed in this paper is suitable for other geometric theories as well .",
    "for example , to analyze the signalling in a theory dealing only with the causal relations between events , not with the entire metric , it suffices to replace the words _ an isometry @xmath73 _ in definition  [ def : alt ] by _ a conformal isometry @xmath73_. likewise , one might be interested in a theory which considers only ricci flat ( i.  e.  empty , if the einstein equations are imposed ) spacetimes .",
    "the proposition proven in @xcite and reformulated in terms of alternatives says that in such a theory superluminal alternatives turn out to be prohibited , if an alternative is admissible only when in one of its spacetimes the weyl tensor vanishes to the future from a cauchy surface through @xmath0 .",
    "it is important that the above - mentioned existence and uniqueness theorem is proven only under some  physically justified \" assumptions regarding the properties of the right hand side of the einstein equation .",
    "a possible set of such assumptions is listed , for example , in @xcite and one of them is that the stress - energy tensor is at most a polynomial in @xmath115 ( the corresponding assumption in @xcite allows the tensor to include also the first derivatives of the metric ) .",
    "but those assumptions are _ known _ to fail in some physically interesting situations . in particular , vacuum polarization typically leads to the appearance in the right hand side of the einstein equations of terms containing second derivatives of the metric . which suggests that strong seniclassical effects like those expected in the early universe , or near black hole horizons , may lead to superluminal propagation of gravity .",
    "the fact that a single event is associated with two fronts , either in its own spacetime , has a quite non - trivial consequence because they do not need to be superluminal both _ at once_.    * . definition . *    an alternative is called _ superluminal _ if both its fronts are superluminal and _ semi - superluminal _ if only one is .",
    "suppose , in a world @xmath61 a photon is sent from the earth ( we denote this event @xmath116 ) to arrive at a distant star at some moment @xmath117 by the clock of that star .",
    "let , further , @xmath62 be the world which was initially the same as @xmath61 ( whether it _ was _ the same may depend on what theory we are using for our analysis of the situation ) , but in which instead of the photon a mighty spaceship is sent to the star ( the start of the spaceship is @xmath118 ) . on its way to the star the spaceship warps and tears the spacetime by exploding passing stars , merging binary black holes and triggering other imaginable powerful processes .",
    "assuming that no superluminal (  tachyonic \" ) matter is involved , the spaceship arrives at the star later than the photon emitted in @xmath118 , but nevertheless it is imaginable that its arrival time @xmath119 is _ less _ than @xmath117 .",
    "thus , the speed of the spaceship in one world ( @xmath62 ) would exceed the speed of light in another ( @xmath61 ) , which would not contradict the non - tachyonic nature of the spaceship .",
    "nor would such a flight break the  light barrier \" in @xmath61 : the inequality @xmath120 does imply that the front @xmath121 is superluminal , but no _ material signal _ in @xmath61 corresponds to that front . in particular , there is no spaceship in _ that _ spacetime associated with @xmath121 .",
    "it is such a pair of worlds @xmath106 that we call a semi - superluminal alternative .",
    "a theory admitting such alternatives allows superluminal signalling without tachyons .    * .",

    "speaking more formally , @xmath129 is the complement to the union of two future cones with the vertices at those two points . that @xmath129 is maximal indeed is clear from the fact that any larger past set would contain a past directed timelike curve @xmath130 terminating at one of the mentioned vertices , while @xmath131 can not have a past end point ( because of the singularity ) .",
    "evidently , @xmath132 , so @xmath121 is superluminal . at the same time",
    "the surface @xmath133 does not correspond to any signal in @xmath61 ( see above ) . and",
    "the front @xmath126 _ is not _",
    "superluminal , whence we conclude that the alternative @xmath70 is _ _ semi-__superluminal .",
    "although the spaceship reaches the destination sooner than the photon shown in figure  [ fig : hyperj ] , the photon belongs to another universe . in its own universe",
    "@xmath62 the spaceship moves on a timelike curve , in full agreement with its non - tachyonic nature .",
    "a flaw in the just considered alternative is that the difference between @xmath61 and @xmath62 is too exotic .",
    "one can not say today whether  the topology change \" of that kind ( if possible at all ) can be attributable to something that takes place in @xmath134 .",
