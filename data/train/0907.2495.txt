    "the string gas model @xcite is one of interesting scenarios in string cosmologies ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the simplest of such model treats the space as @xmath0 . if many strings wrap over cycles of a nine - dimensional torus , @xmath1 at a very early universe , the cosmological singularity can be resolved by t - duality @xcite .",
    "the string gas models also provide an intriguing idea on a realization of the large three - dimensional space by annihilation of the strings , while the scale of the six - dimensional torus is stabilized by the tension of remaining strings .",
    "the brane gas models @xcite are extension of the idea and have been considered a cosmological role of windings of d - branes .",
    "although these gas models are very interesting , one of the serious problems is the moduli stability .",
    "this problem is a serious obstacle to build string / brane gas models consistent with a realistic phenomenology and cosmology .",
    "this is resulting from massless scalar fields appear on the three dimensions without the moduli stabilization .",
    "there are many interesting works on the moduli stabilization @xcite . among the stability of many moduli fields ,",
    "the stabilization of the dilaton field has been difficult in brane gas models .",
    "recently , we have shown that electric fields on d - brane , windings of ns@xmath2-brane and kaluza - klein monopole ( kk@xmath2-monopole ) can stabilize radial moduli fields of a six - dimensional torus @xmath3 and the dilaton field simultaneously in brane gas models based on type ii string theories @xcite .    according to the result of @xcite , gases of branes wrapping over only cycles of @xmath3",
    "make the energy density of a pressureless matter , namely the energy density is inversely proportional to the third power of the scale factor .",
    "this implies that we observe those wrapped branes as point particles on the three - dimensional space .",
    "this fact leads to the appearance of the dark matter of the wrapped branes , because wrapped branes are not ordinary matters .",
    "the possibility of the dark matter of the wrapped branes has been investigated in various models .",
    "the appearance of light particles of the wrapped branes in the string frame , if the string scale , @xmath4 is larger than the planck length in ref.@xcite .",
    "the large scale structure and the accelerating phase were discussed in @xcite without an influence of the ramond - ramond ( rr ) flux , although d - branes have the rr charges .",
    "however , the mass and the charge of rr flux are not estimated simultaneously in the four - dimensional einstein frame which is required for obtaining realistic models .",
    "we take the four - dimensional einstein frame , when we consider the time - independent four - dimensional gravitational constant after the kaluza - klein reduction . in this frame , the realization of light wrapped branes is not trivial , since it is known that a large volume of the six - dimensional torus and a weak string coupling give rise to heavy wrapped branes in the string frame for a small string length @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study wrapped branes in the brane gas cosmology based on type ii string theories as dark matter , using the effective field theory of brane gas models .",
    "we estimate the mass and the charge on the rr flux and on moduli fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations also provide forces between the branes .",
    "we find some models where branes can be realized as dust particles whose masses can be around 10tev scales .",
    "we take the string scale as @xmath5 and consider a compactification with @xmath3 and the calabi - yau threefold ( cy@xmath6 ) , using the four - dimensional einstein frame which is the key idea to obtain a light mass and a weak interaction .",
    "the description of the effective field theory requires a large volume of a compactified space and a weak string coupling , because quantum corrections should be suppressed and the perturbative expansions should be valid . in the string frame , those conditions lead to the appearance of heavy wrapped branes , as the world volume action of the brane is proportional to its volume and the inverse of the string coupling .",
    "it seems apparent that the dark matter candidate of the wrapped branes may be difficult in this frame .",
    "however , in the four - dimensional einstein frame , we will show that there are cases where the wrapped branes obtain the light mass and the small charge on the rr flux and on the moduli fluctuations under the large volume and the weak string coupling .",
    "we will show that the effective masses and charges satisfy the sea - saw like dual relations which are time - independent , while each quantity depends on the time variable through moduli fields .",
    "the dual relations are one of reasons for the existence of the various light wrapped branes with the small charges .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", the estimation of the mass and charge is mainly done by controlling scales of the compactified space by hand . however , in this paper , the string scale is of the order of the planck scale and then the existence of light particles of wrapped branes is quite non - trivial under the large volume . in one model , we find that the mass of the d@xmath7-brane is of the order of @xmath8 tev , if we take the six - dimensional compactified volume as @xmath9 where @xmath4 is the string length and holds @xmath10 in this paper .",
    "the square of the effective charges of the rr flux and of the moduli fluctuations is of order @xmath11 by the same scale of the compactification .",
    "then , the d@xmath7-branes is a possible candidate for the dark matter at a late time .",
    "we also consider the masses of wrapped branes by a d@xmath12-kk@xmath2 brane gas systems @xcite , because the system can be stabilized by the scale of the @xmath3 and the dilaton field .",
    "it is not trivial that both the weak string coupling and the large scale of the compactification are realized simultaneously in the specific model after the moduli stabilization .",
    "we find such realization of those conditions exists if the number density of d@xmath12 and kk@xmath2 satisfy a specific condition which is given later . in the case of the calabi - yau compactification , we can not prove the moduli stabilization in this model , however the dual relation is also satisfied and then we can show that light particles are generated for the large volume of the cy@xmath6 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will give the definition of the four - dimensional einstein frame . in section iii",
    ", we will consider the effective world volume action of wrapped branes in the four - dimensional einstein frame . in section iv",

    "the dual relation explains the existence of the light wrapped branes . in section",
    "v , we will see a case in which the electric - magnetic dual relation of wrapped branes is satisfied in the cy@xmath6 compactification . in section",
    "vi , we will investigate the effective rr charge in the four - dimensional einstein frame .",
    "the effective coupling of d@xmath13- and d@xmath14-brane also satisfies the electric - magnetic dual relation . in section vii",
    ", we will comment on the charge of fluctuations of the moduli fields , because those fluctuations also give interactions between various branes . in section viii",

    "ix will be devoted to the summary and some discussions .",
    "in this section , we shall define the four - dimensional einstein frame which gives the time - independent four - dimensional gravitational constant after a compactification .",
    "in general , the kaluza - klein reduction gives rise to a coupling between the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term and various moduli fields .",
    "if those moduli fields are functions of coordinates of the compactified space , we can integral out moduli fields and renormalize the factor into the higher dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "however , in cosmologies , moduli fields depend on the time and , therefore , we can not integral out the moduli fields completely . the time - independent newton constant",
    "can be easily realized in the four - dimensional einstein frame which is useful to analyze a behavior of scale factors and various fields .",
    "we consider a homogeneous ten - dimensional metric and a six - dimensional torus , @xmath3 as a compactified space .",
    "the scale factors are functions of the time coordinate .",
    "the @xmath3 has six scale factors corresponding to six cycles .",
    "the string - frame metric is given by the following equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the line element of the flat three - dimensional space , @xmath17 or @xmath18 and the cycle of @xmath3 is defined as @xmath19 @xmath20 is related with a string length as @xmath21 .",
    "the scale factor @xmath22 describes the scaling of the cycle defined by ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "the four - dimensional einstein frame is defined by the following transformation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is dilaton field . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the lapse function and the scale factor of the three - dimensional space , respectively . for the einstein frame the proper time of the four - dimensional space - time",
    "is defined by @xmath27 which is not equivalent to the proper time of the ten - dimensional space - time in the string frame because of @xmath28 .    by ( [ e3 ] )",
    "the dilaton gravity sector of the string frame action becomes @xcite : @xmath29 where the four - dimensional newton constant and the ten - dimensional gravitational constant are given by @xcite @xmath30    eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) shows that the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term which is given by the first term of the second line does not involve moduli fields and the dilaton . by ( [ e5 ] ) we find that the string length is of the order of the planck length .",
    "an advantage of the new variable @xmath31 is that the kinetic term of the above action becomes diagonal .",
    "in the previous section , we have defined the four - dimensional einstein frame which gives the four - dimensional einstein - hilbert term with the time - independent newton constant and diagonal kinetic terms of moduli fields .",
    "we found that the dynamics of the moduli fields is governed by potential terms derived by flux terms and brane sources after the kaluza - klein reduction . in this section , we will consider the effective action of the wrapped d@xmath13-brane , ns@xmath2-brane and kk@xmath2-monopole , using the four - dimensional einstein frame and derive the energy density of those ingredients which contribute as potential terms for the moduli fields .",
    "we consider branes wrapping over only cycles of @xmath3 .",
    "after the compactification , we see those objects as point particles on the three - dimensional space . this expectation is motivated by ref .",
    "@xcite which shows that wrapped brane gases give the energy density of a pressureless matter . in @xcite , we gave the effective action without a dependence of the velocity along the three - dimensional space .",
    "we would like to derive the effective action with the velocity on the three - dimensional space .",
    "the effective action will be used to read off the mass and the charge of a wrapped brane in later sections . to derive the effective action we assume a cancellation of total rr charges of the d - branes , because of homogeneous distributions of many d - branes on the nine - dimensional space by the brane gas approximation .",
    "thus , we will assume wrapped branes as gases of free particles .",
    "first , we will consider the world volume action of d@xmath13-brane wrapping over a @xmath13-dimensional cycle of @xmath3 . if the d@xmath13-brane wraps over a ( @xmath32)-cycle ( @xmath33 ) , gauge fields on the d@xmath13-brane exist along the ( @xmath32)-directions .",
    "the d@xmath13-brane can move along transverse directions .",
    "we assume that the distributions of the branes are homogeneous and that the gauge field is abelian .",
    "then the gauge potential and transverse coordinates depend only on the time variable , i.e. @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath37 .",
    "we will adopt the coordinate system as @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "then , the dirac - born - infeld action of d@xmath13-brane wrapping over the ( @xmath32)-cycle , @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 where the tension of the d@xmath13-brane is given by @xcite @xmath43 @xmath44 denotes the velocity along the three - dimensional space .",
    "the world volume action is proportional to @xmath45 and then the mass becomes heavy for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the above action is defined in the string frame .",
    "we have to take the four - dimensional frame to extract the four - dimensional dynamics . substituting ( [ e3 ] ) for ( [ e6 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined by the following equation : @xmath50 compared with ( [ e8 ] ) to ( [ e6 ] ) , we find the basic difference between the string frame and einstein frame . in the string frame ,",
    "the winding mode of the world volume depends on the dilaton , whereas the winding mode of d@xmath13-brane does not have the coupling of the dilaton field in the four - dimensional einstein frame .",
    "this fact implies that the winding mode can not stabilize the dilaton field in the four - dimensional einstein frame .",
    "namely , if we take @xmath49 defined by ( [ e9 ] ) , we also can not stabilize the dilaton , since @xmath49 includes the dilaton with @xmath51 only .",
    "therefore , the d@xmath13-brane wrapping over cycles of @xmath3 can not stabilize the dilaton field in the four - dimensional einstein frame , using the cosmological background defined by ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the wrapped branes can be regarded as the ideal gas based on the dilute gas approximation .",

    "the conjugate momentum must be an integer on a cycle of the @xmath3 therefore @xmath55 is an integer . by the t - dulaity @xmath56 and @xmath55 is mapped each other @xcite and then @xmath56 must be also an integer .",
    "the similar property on a quantized momentum is satisfied for a fundamental string as shown in appendix [ appendixc ] .",
    "we can solve the equations ( [ e10 ] ) and ( [ e11 ] ) on @xmath49 : @xmath59    in the four - dimensional einstein frame , the potential term is derived by @xmath60 using ( [ e8 ] ) , ( [ e12 ] ) and ( [ e13 ] ) , we obtain the potential of the d@xmath13-brane wrapping over the ( @xmath61)-cycle : @xmath62 this corresponds to the energy density of a relativistic particle with the mass given by @xmath63    .,width=226 ]    thus , we see d@xmath13-branes behave as point particles on the three - dimensional space as fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the world volume decays with @xmath64 as the pressureless matter .",
    "the mass given by ( [ e15 ] ) has the following role as a potential of the moduli fields .",
    "the winding part of ( [ e15 ] ) is proportional to @xmath65 this indicates that the wrapped d@xmath13-brane binds the ( @xmath61)-cycle where the d@xmath13-brane expands and the ( @xmath66)-direction is stretched like a rubber band as in fig.[fig2 ] .        similarly , by ( [ e12 ] ) it is found that the electric fields in @xmath67 also bind the ( @xmath61)-cycle .",
    "the transverse velocities in @xmath67 make a pressure bringing the expansion to the transverse directions .",
    "we will derive the action of the point particle for ns@xmath2-brane and kk@xmath2-monopole in type ii string theory which has five spatial dimensions . in this paper , we consider only winding modes of ns@xmath2-brane and kk@xmath2-monopole moving along the three - dimensional space .",

    "in section iii , the effective mass of the wrapped brane is derived in the four - dimensional einstein frame . in this section",
    ", we would like to consider a behavior of the mass derived in the previous section , taking a large scale of the @xmath3 and a weak string coupling related with the dilaton field as @xmath80 .",
    "the condition is required to consider an effective field theory .",
    "it is not necessarily correct that d@xmath13-brane is very heavy with a large volume and a weak string coupling , since the world volume action has the nontrivial coupling to the dilaton and the scale of @xmath3 in the four - dimensional einstein frame .",

    "secondly , we will consider the anisotropic case , @xmath94 satisfying @xmath95 for the large volume condition . by ( [ e15 ] ) the masses of the wrapped d@xmath13- and d@xmath14-brane can be represented as @xmath96 those masses explicitly satisfy the following electric - magnetic dual relation : @xmath97 the right hand side of the above equation is independent on scale factors , while masses depend on the time .",
    "thus , masses of d@xmath13- and d@xmath14-brane are not independent each other and satisfy a sea - saw like condition .",
    "a d@xmath13-brane becomes light when a d@xmath14-brane has a heavy mass and vice versa .",
