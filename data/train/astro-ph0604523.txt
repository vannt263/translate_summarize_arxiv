    "the resolved fraction averaged on the standard 210 kev band is of the order of 80% ( see hickox & markevitch 2006 for a recent estimate ) . at energies greater than 10 kev , where the bulk of the background energy density is produced , the resolved fraction is negligible , being strongly limited by the lack of imaging x  ray observations .",

    "a relatively wide portion of the model parameter space remains so far unexplored ( e.g. comastri 2004a ) .",
    "within the framework of agn synthesis models the key parameters responsible for the shape and intensity of the @xmath3 10 kev xrb spectrum are :    * the covering fraction and geometrical distribution of the cold dense gas responsible of the reflection `` hump '' peaking at 2030 kev and observed in both type 1 and type 2 agn . * the relative fraction of heavily obscured sources with column densities of the order of a few @xmath4 @xmath1 ( the so called `` mildly '' compton thick agn ;",
    "see comastri 2004b for a review ) . * the high energy cut  off of the primary emission which is usually parameterized as an exponential roll - over with an e  folding energy of a few hundreds of kev .        the reflection of hard x ",

    "2002 for a spectral survey of bright agn with _ bepposax _ ) . for unobscured or relatively unobscured agn",
    "the reflecting material is covering about @xmath5 sr .",
    "several independent observational evidences suggest that a fraction as large as 50% ( or even higher ) of the seyfert 2 galaxies in the local universe are obscured by compton  thick material ( risaliti et al . 1999 ; guainazzi et al . 2005 ; comastri 2004b ) .",
    "a population of compton thick ( hereinafter ct ) sources has to be included in agn synthesis models for the xrb in order to match the 30 kev intensity peak and at the same time to avoid an excessive number of compton thin agn which are not detected in _",
    "chandra _ and xmm_newton _ deep surveys ( see the discussion in comastri 2004b ) .",
    "their relative fraction and cosmological evolution are free parameters which are tuned until a good fit to the xrb spectrum is obtained .",
    "assuming the same cosmological evolution of soft x ",
    "ray selected type 1 agn of hasinger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the best fit model shown in figure 1 is obtained with a relative fraction of ct agn which is the same of compton thin ( @xmath6 in the range 10@xmath710@xmath8 @xmath1 ) and twice than unobscured ( @xmath9 @xmath1 ) agn ( see gilli et al 2006 for further details ) .",
    "the peaked shape of the ct spectrum in a @xmath10 plot is due to heavy absorption at low energies and the high energy cut  off ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the latter , fixed at 320 kev in fig .  1 , has to be present in the high energy spectrum of all the sources ( regardless of the absorption column density ) otherwise the observed xrb flux above about 100 kev would be exceeded .    the high energy cut  off e  folding energy has been unambiguosly measured only for a bunch of nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "the best fit values are loosely constrained in the 150350 kev range ( matt 2004 ; malizia et al .",
    "both bepposax ( matt et al . 1999 ) and more recent _ integral _ observations ( soldi et al . 2005 ) suggest a large scatter in the @xmath11 values which span from about 50 kev up to lower limits of the order of 500 kev . while a clear bias against large values of the high energy cut  off is present , the available observations seem to indicate that such a parameter might not be the same in all the sources at variance with the assumptions of most of the synthesis models .    the properties of the sources of the `` unresolved '' background may be inferred by subtracting from the observed broad band spectrum the energy dependent fraction of the `` resolved '' xrb .",
    "such an approach has been pursued both making use of present observations ( worsley et al .",
    "2005 ) and exploiting the xrb synthesis models ( comastri 2004 ) . in the former case the spectral shape of the `` unresolved '' background is consistent with that expected from a population of obscured ( @xmath12 @xmath1 ) agn at redshifts @xmath13 0.51.5 . in the latter , following a model dependent approach , the shape of the unresolved fraction can be predicted over a much wider energy range .",
    "more specifically assuming a set of model parameters tuned to match the 210 kev resolved fraction and to reproduce the observed absorption distribution in deep fields the predicted xrb flux and spectral shape above 10 kev are strongly dependent from the adopted of @xmath11 value ( see fig .  2 in comastri 2004a ) .",
    "an additional source of uncertainties comes from the possible contribution to the hard xrb / soft @xmath14ray backgrounds ( above about 100 kev ) of the population of radio  loud sources which includes , for the purposes of the present exercise , both flat spectrum radio quasars ( e.g. 3c 273 ) and bl lac objects .",
    "we refer to giommi et al .",
    "( 2006 and these proceedings ) for a detailed discussion of their contribution to the extragalactic x  ray and @xmath14ray bands . in the very first approximation radio",
    " loud sources are expected to provide the bulk of the @xmath14ray background above a few tens of mev , while radio  quiet agn dominate below 100 kev . in between their relative contribution",
    "is expected to be comparable .",
    "an attempt to estimate the contribution of radio  loud quasars to the x  ray / soft @xmath14ray background ( from 1 kev to a few mev ) is presented here .",
    "the assumed template spectrum and cosmological evolution are as follows :    * the average x  ray/@xmath14ray spectrum is parameterized with a single power law plus a high energy cut  off . * the input spectrum is then folded with the same luminosity function of radio  quiet agn assuming a pure luminosity evolution of the form @xmath15 normalized to account for 10% of the xrb flux at 1 kev in agreement with giommi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and galbiati et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    the power law slope energy index @xmath16 is varied in the range 0.50.7 consistent with the averaged value observed in the x  ray band over a large range of redshifts ( i.e.reeves & turner 2000 ; page et al . 2005 ; lopez et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the choiche of the @xmath11 value is driven by the requirement of not exceeding the background flux .",
    "the results for three representative pairs of @xmath16 and @xmath11 : ( 0.5 , 800 kev ) ; ( 0.6 , 1 mev ) and ( 0.7 , 2 mev ) are shown in figure 2 ( long dashed lines from top to bottom respectively ) . in our approach , almost by definition , the two parameters are not completely independent , the flatter the power law slope , the lower the cut  off energy is .",
    "the contribution of radio loud agn is then summed to the observationally resolved fraction in the 210 kev range , extrapolated to high energies following the prescriptions of the gilli et al .",

    "1996),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the residual unresolved background obtained by subtracting the models previously described from the total xrb flux , modeled using the gruber ( 1992 ) analytical approximation , is shown in figure 3 . a comparison with the contribution of a population of ct agn , assumed to evolve as unobscured sources ( hasinger et al . 2005 ) , for two different values ( 100 and 320 kev ) of the high energy cut ",
    "off is shown in fig .",
    "the model spectra agree extremely well below the peak energy while at higher energies , depending from the @xmath11 and @xmath16 values adopted to model the contribution of radio  loud agn , the predicted residual spectrum falls more rapidly with an over - exponential shape which is more pronounced for @xmath16=0.5 , @xmath11=800 kev . at the face value",
    "these results suggest that the sources of the unresolved background are characterized by either a very peaked spectrum or are clustered over a smaller redshift range or a combination of the two .",
    "the above described exercise confirm and somewhat extend the findings of worsley et al ( 2005 ) and comastri ( 2004a ) .",
    "even though the model dependent approach does not allow to break the degeneracy between the spectral parameters and in particular among the cut  off energy and the source redshift",
    "some preliminary conclusions may be already drawn .",
    "a population of ct agn with a space density and cosmological evolution comparable to that of less obscured , compton thin sources provide an excellent description of the residual xrb spectrum up to about 1020 kev . at higher energies",
    "the residual spectrum is no longer well approximated by an exponentially cut - offed power law model folded with the redshift distribution observed in deep _",
    "chandra _ and xmm_newton _ fields .",
    "it can be argued that a suitable fine tuning of cut  off energy and redshift distributions along with a more extended treatement of the contribution of radio  loud agn may provide a much better fit to the unresolved xrb above 30 kev .",
    "however it should be also stressed that the observational constraints used to compute the residual xrb are still subject to significant uncertainties .",
    "recent measurements of the xrb spectral intensity below 10 kev obtained with imaging instrument are systematically higher than the intensity originally measured by heao1a2 ( see fig .  1 and revnivtsev et al .",
    "2005 for a recent reanalysis of the heao1 data ) , given that the the only available observation of the intensity and location of the xrb peak is from the same a2 experiment , some doubts have been raised on the absolute flux and intensity of the xrb above 10 kev . in the hard x ",

    "is needed .",
    "sensitive imaging observations down to about 10@xmath17 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 in the approximately 1050 kev energy range would resolve about half of the background in that band to be compared with the present less than a few percent .",
    "a major breaktrough in the census and the study of obscured accreting black holes is expected by future hard x  ray missions and especially by simbol - x ( ferrando et al .",
    "a mission capable to explore the 1001000 kev decade with comparably good sensitivity ( i.e.the gamma ray imager mission concept see von ballmoos and kndlseder these proceedings ) would open the possibility to investigate the origin of the primary emission mechanism in agn , presumably responsible of the high energy cut  off , with important consequences for the scientific objectives discussed in this paper .",
