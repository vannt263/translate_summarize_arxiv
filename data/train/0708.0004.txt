    "the correlation between galaxy type and clustering amplitude was first seen by @xcite as a difference in the clustering slope of morphologically - selected elliptical and spiral galaxies , with ellipticals having a steeper slope .",

    "we expand upon that study here by measuring the clustering as a function of scale ( instead of using a scale - averaged overdensity ) using a statistic that may more readily be compared with simulations , as it does not depend upon the bias of the tracer sample used , as is the case with overdensities .",

    ". these departures from a power law are naturally explained in the hod framework , which provides a statistical understanding of the relation between galaxies and their dark matter halos , as the transition between pairs of galaxies within the same halo ( the ` one - halo ' term ) on small scales and galaxies in different halos ( the ` two - halo ' term ) on larger scales @xcite .",
    "small - scale deviations from a power law are expected to be more significant at @xmath18 , where the exponential tail of the mass function moves to smaller masses , so that at a given mass scale the slope of the mass function becomes steeper @xcite .",
    "observationally , deviations are also seen at a given redshift for the brightest galaxy samples , with @xmath7 .",
    "this is likely due to the satellite fraction decreasing for brighter samples ; brighter galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies than satellite galaxies @xcite , which leads to a steeper one - halo term ( tinker et al , in prep . ) as more pairs are central - satellite pairs rather than satellite - satellite pairs and have , on average , a smaller separation",

    "this estimator has been shown to perform as well as the hamilton estimator @xcite but is preferred here as it is relatively insensitive to the size of the random catalog and handles edge corrections well @xcite .    to estimate the cross - correlation function between two galaxy samples , we measure the observed number of galaxies from a given sample around each galaxy in another sample as a function of distance , divided by the expected number of galaxies for a random distribution .",
    "for this we use the simple estimator @xmath77 where @xmath78 are pairs of galaxies between the two samples and @xmath79 are galaxy - random pairs between one galaxy sample and the random catalog of the other sample , where the pair counts have been normalized by @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the deep2 redshift success rate is @xmath8070% overall ( defined as the percentage of galaxies targeted for spectroscopy that have a well - determined redshift ) and is not entirely uniform across the survey ; some slitmasks are observed under better conditions than others and therefore yield a slightly higher completeness .",
    "we only use regions of the survey with a redshift success rate @xmath8065% , and the spatially - varying success rate is taken into account in the window function , which is applied to the random catalog to ensure that it has the same spatial distribution as the survey . the two - dimensional window function of the deep2 data in the plane of the sky reflects the probability of observing a galaxy and takes into account the overall outline of the survey and the geometry of the overlapping slitmasks as well as vignetting in the deimos camera and gaps between the deimos ccds .",
    "the varying redshift success is also taken into account such that regions of the sky with a higher completeness have a correspondingly higher number of random points .",

    "it is straightforward to relate @xmath122 to the three - dimensional correlation function , @xmath81 . for a power - law correlation function , @xmath124 , and our choice of @xmath125 ,",
    "this relation becomes @xmath126      when observing with multi - object slitmasks , the spectra of targets can not be allowed to overlap on the ccd array ; therefore , objects that lie near each other in the direction on the sky that is perpendicular to the wavelength direction on the ccd can not be simultaneously observed .",
    "this results in undersampling the regions of the sky with the highest density of targets . to reduce the impact of this bias , adjacent",
    "deep2 slitmasks are positioned approximately a half - mask width apart , giving each galaxy two chances to appear on a mask ; we also adaptively tile the slitmask locations to hold constant the number of targets per mask . in spite of these steps ,",
    "the probability that a target is selected for spectroscopy is diminished by @xmath127% if the distance to its second nearest neighbor is less than 10 arcseconds ( for technical details of the slitmask design , see @xcite ) .",
    "this introduces a roughly predictable systematic bias which leads to underestimating the correlation strength on small scales .",
    "the objects that are in conflict are often not at the same redshift , however , such that the effect is not particularly large .    to correct for this effect we use the mock catalogs of @xcite with galaxy colors added as described in @xcite .",
    "we measure the ratio of both  and  in the mock catalogs between samples of galaxies from catalogs with and without the slitmask target selection algorithm applied .",
    "we then multiply the measured and  in the data by this ratio , which is a smooth function of scale and varies from @xmath128% on the smallest scales to 2% on scales greater than @xmath129 .",
    "we tested mock catalog samples with identical redshift , luminosity and color ranges as each data sample used here and found no significant differences in the multiplicative corrections as a function of color or luminosity , such that the same correction derived from the largest sample is our best estimate for all other samples .",
    "the effect of this slitmask correction is small ; it increases  by 1.5% and @xmath3 by 2.5% .",
    "we include an additional error due to this correction , which is added in quadrature to the error on .",
    "this error is estimated from the variance on the correction in the mock catalogs and is a function of scale , varying from 10% at @xmath130  to 2% on scales @xmath131 .",
    "we first compare the main blue and red galaxy samples , both of which have @xmath46 .",
    "the top left panels in figure [ xisp_all ] show  for these two samples , with contours indicating constant probability , where the dark line is @xmath132 .",
    "there are several clear trends present in these diagrams ; red galaxies are seen to be more clustered than blue galaxies ( a given @xmath81 is seen at larger separations ) and show much stronger fingers of god , as seen in the elongation along the @xmath88 direction at small @xmath89 separations ( @xmath1331 ) .",
    "both of these results reflect the fact that a color - density relation is in place at @xmath0 , with red galaxies residing more in overdense regions such as groups and clusters than blue galaxies .",
    "infall on large scales is plainly seen in these  diagrams for blue galaxies , as indicated by the flattening of the contours along the line of sight .",
    "coherent infall may be present for red galaxies as well , though it is harder to detect due to the larger fingers of god ( see section 4.9 for more details ) .",
    "redshift - space distortions are significant out to @xmath134 , such that it is important to not use the usual power - law estimator ( equation [ powerlawwprp ] ) to infer  and @xmath3 from , as this equation assumes that one has integrated  to @xmath135 .",
    "the top left panel of figure [ wprp_all ] shows the projected correlation function , , for the main red and blue samples .",
    "red galaxies exhibit a significantly steeper slope than blue galaxies , and both samples are well approximated by a power law within the error bars .",
    "power - law fits are given in table 2 , fitting the data on scales @xmath136 ; the smallest @xmath89 bin ( 0.05 ) is not used in these fits due to the rise on small scales which is seen in some samples ( see section 4.3 for further discussion of deviations on small scales ) . including the smallest bin in these fits , or fitting only on scales larger than @xmath129 , does not change the results for the main blue and red galaxy samples .    the correlation length for red galaxies is found to be significantly higher than for blue galaxies : @xmath137  compared to @xmath138 .",

    "furthermore , there has been very little evolution in the slope of the correlation function for either red or blue galaxies since @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the implications of this in section 6 .",
    "our  values for blue and red galaxies are somewhat higher than those reported by @xcite and @xcite , though generally within the large errors in those findings .",

    "our  value found here is 2@xmath141 and 5@xmath141 higher than @xcite and @xcite , while for red galaxies our  value is 1@xmath141 and 2@xmath141 higher , respectively , where the errors have been added in quadrature .",

    "we also use the estimator of pwe07 , as described in section 3.3 , to measure @xmath122 for the main blue and red samples ; the results are shown in fig .  [ omega ] .",
    "we have not attempted to correct for slitmask effects in the @xmath122 estimator ; these effects are small , as discussed above . using eqn .",

    "these  and @xmath3 values are consistent with the estimates derived above from fitting to @xmath121 . in fact , because the correlation coefficient between  and @xmath3 is large and negative ( @xmath154 ) , difference between the results of the two estimators are much less significant than the projected errors imply .",
    "the error bars on @xmath149 and @xmath3 are larger using the @xmath122 estimator , which is not surprising given that @xmath122 is an inversion of @xmath121 to a localized integral of @xmath119 .",
    "in addition to measuring the auto - correlation of blue and red galaxies separately , the cross - correlation between the two samples can be used to further understand the spatial relationship between blue and red galaxies .",
    "the cross - correlation between two samples measures the clustering of one type of object around the other and provides information on the mixing of the populations . on large , linear scales , in the two - halo regime",
    ", blue and red galaxies should be well - mixed and trace the same overall large - scale structure , such that the cross - correlation should equal the geometric mean of the auto - correlations of each sample . on small scales , however , within the one - halo term , deviations from the geometric mean encode information about the differences in the halos the two samples populate .",
    "for example , if some halos contain almost exclusively red galaxies and others only blue galaxies , then the cross - correlation function would fall below the geometric mean .",
    "the blue - red galaxy cross - correlation function can therefore be used to distinguish between different star formation quenching scenarios , as it traces the distribution of quiescent and actively star - forming galaxies around each other .",

    "also plotted are deviations from this power law for the geometric mean : @xmath160 while the cross - correlation ( dot - dash line ) is consistent with the geometric mean ( dotted line ) within the error bars , on scales @xmath155  ( the one - halo term ) the cross - correlation is closer to the blue  than the red .",
    "this reflects a deficit of blue galaxies near red galaxies , which could be due to the centers of groups being occupied preferentially by red galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the observed cross - correlation between deep2 groups and galaxies @xcite , which is higher for red galaxies than blue galaxies , again indicating that red galaxies tend to be at the centers of groups .    a similar effect has been seen at @xmath161 in the sdss red - blue cross - correlation function .",

    "all of the blue luminosity samples show coherent infall on large scales .",

    "deviations from a power law for the brighter samples are shown in figure [ wprp_lum_powerlaw ] ; on scales @xmath171  there is a clear rise in the correlation function of blue galaxies .",
    "a similar increase on small scales was seen for all deep2 galaxies in @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to brighter galaxies having , on average , a higher probability of being a central galaxy rather than a satellite galaxy @xcite , which leads to a relative rise in the one - halo term compared to the two - halo term ( tinker et al , in prep . ) .",
    "there may also be a contribution from interaction - driven starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of a strong rise on small scales in the brighter red samples likely results from red deep2 galaxies having a higher satellite fraction than blue galaxies , at a given luminosity .",

    "no value of @xmath184 would lead to a consistent trend of @xmath173 with luminosity when compared with our results or local results from @xcite or @xcite .",
    "estimating  from an angular correlation function , as done in @xcite , requires very accurate knowledge of the redshift distribution ; this may account for the discrepancy with the results from spectroscopic surveys .",
    "@xcite find that within the full deep2 galaxy sample the clustering strength depends strongly on luminosity .",
    "this can still occur even if there is no luminosity dependence for red or blue samples separately , as the red galaxy fraction is a function of luminosity ; the higher prevalence of red galaxies in the brighter samples leads to  increasing as @xmath36 decreases .",
    "the clear bimodality both locally and at @xmath62 in galaxy properties , whether defined by restframe color , morphology or spectral type , raises the question of how these two main types arise and what , if any , evolutionary connection exists between them .",
    "the observed buildup of galaxies on the red sequence since @xmath62 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that blue galaxies are moving to the red sequence with time , though the details of this transition are not clear .",
    "the general outline , however , is that star formation begins to shut down or be quenched in blue galaxies , after which they passively evolve onto the red sequence .",
    "the star formation quenching process(es ) involved may be causally related to the environment of the galaxy ( e.g. , ram pressure or tidal stripping of gas @xcite ) , such that galaxies in higher density regions end their star forming phase more readily , thus creating a color - density relation .",
    "alternatively , the process may be inherent to the galaxy and depend on its age or stellar or halo mass , in which case the process may be correlated with environment but not caused by it @xcite .",
    "to elucidate what is causing this change , we can investigate the clustering properties of galaxies located at the transition region between these populations . here",
    "we study ` green ' galaxies located near the minimum of the observed color bimodality as defined in  2.2 .",
    "the green galaxy , shown in the upper right panel of figure [ xisp_all ] , exhibits an intermediate clustering amplitude between the blue and red galaxy samples , as well as intermediate - strength fingers of god .",
    "the green population displays somewhat similar infall on large scales as blue galaxies , though the contours are noisy on large scales due to the relatively small sample size .",
    "the projected correlation function for green galaxies is shown in the lower left panel of figure [ wprp_all ] , plotted with  for red and blue galaxies for comparison . on large scales ( @xmath131 )",
    "the green galaxies have a clustering amplitude similar to that of red galaxies , while on small scales the amplitude is closer to that of blue galaxies .",
    "the large - scale agreement with the red galaxy population implies that green galaxies reside in or on the outskirts of halos of similar mass as red galaxies , as they have the same clustering for the two - halo term .",
    "green galaxies are therefore generally in the same overdense regions as red galaxies . however , the one - halo term for green galaxies is lower than for red galaxies , which likely reflects a lower radial concentration of green galaxies within their parent halos .",
    "the overall picture is consistent with galaxies having green colors while on the outskirts of halos and becoming redder as they reach the center of the overdensity .",
    "these results point towards green galaxies being a distinct population and not a simple mix of red and blue galaxies .    to investigate these trends further ,",
    "we compute the cross - correlation between the green galaxy sample and the main blue and red galaxy samples .",
    "the  diagrams ( lower right panels of figure [ xisp_all ] ) show more significant infall on large scales in the green - blue cross - correlation than the green - red cross - correlation ( comparing , for example , the @xmath132 contours ) .",
    "the green - red cross - correlation is very similar to the blue - red cross - correlation ( though with smaller fingers of god ) , indicating that green galaxies have comparable kinematics to blue galaxies .",
    "there are also smaller fingers of god in the green - red cross - correlation than in the red auto - correlation .",
    "these results are consistent with green galaxies residing in the same overdense regions as red galaxies , on average , but with a lower probability of being at the cores of those overdensities , compared to red galaxies .",
    "this would result in green galaxies having smaller fingers of god than red galaxies , and a lower auto - correlation on small scales .",
    "it is possible that green galaxies reside on the outskirts of the same halos that red galaxies occupy but are still falling in towards the centers of the halos .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure [ wprp_all ] shows the projected cross - correlation functions between green and blue or red galaxies .",
    "the green - red galaxy clustering amplitude is higher than the green - blue galaxy amplitude on all scales . on scales",
    "@xmath106  the green - red sample is @xmath195% more clustered . on small scales , dominated by the one - halo term ,",
    "the green - red amplitude is a few times higher than the green - blue amplitude : a factor of @xmath196 times higher on scales @xmath11  and a factor of @xmath197 times higher on scales @xmath198 .",
    "one would therefore be _ much _ more likely to find a red close neighbor ( or satellite ) galaxy to a green galaxy than a blue neighbor , and vice versa , if red and blue galaxy samples were of equal size .",
    "another way to frame these results is that a green galaxy is less likely to be a central galaxy than a red galaxy of similar luminosity , but more likely than a comparable blue galaxy .",
    "we note that the green galaxy  likely can not be fit with an hod model that assumes that the radial distribution of galaxies follows that of dark matter particles or subhalos .",
    "the green galaxy radial distribution is clearly different from that of either red or blue galaxies , and most hod models do not allow the radial distribution to vary for different galaxy types .",
    "we next divide the blue and red galaxy samples into finer color bins to investigate the strength of clustering as a function of color _ within _ each population .",
    "figure [ r0_gam_color ] shows  and @xmath3 as a function of color for both the main blue and red samples ( triangles ) , the green sample , and for finer color bins .",
    "as explained in section 2.2 , the finer color bins are not all independent ; this is shown in the figure with a dotted horizontal line showing the color range for each point ( for clarity the color ranges for the main blue and red samples are omitted ) .",
    "in particular , the green galaxy sample contains subsamples of both blue and red galaxies .    within the red population ( where we have two independent samples ) neither  or @xmath3 depend significantly on color",
    "; across the red sequence we detect no change in the clustering properties of galaxies . within the blue population ,",
    "however , there is a strong dependence ; redder galaxies are more clustered than the bluer galaxies .",
    "there is no corresponding trend seen in the slope of the correlation function .",
    "the abrupt change in slope between blue and red galaxies likely reflects the different radial concentrations and satellite fractions of the two populations and may indicate that star formation quenching is an effect associated with the halo properties of galaxies .",
    "interestingly , the green galaxy  is found to be the same as the red galaxy  ( within 1 @xmath141 ) , while the green galaxy @xmath3 is the same as for blue galaxies , not red galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation in the previous section that green galaxies reside in similar mass halos as red galaxies , and are found generally in overdense regions , but are less concentrated within their host halos than red galaxies .",
    "they apparently do not populate the centers of overdensities .",
    "as discussed earlier , luminosity function studies find that a significant fraction of the progenitors of local galaxies on the red sequence must have been in the blue cloud at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our clustering results imply that the galaxies that migrate to the red sequence from @xmath62 to @xmath103 are amongst the redder of the blue galaxies , and the green galaxies at @xmath62 , which are already as clustered as galaxies on the red sequence .    these trends of finding a color - density relation within the blue cloud but not within the red sequence are similar to what has been locally using galaxy environment measures ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are no other published @xmath0 clustering results with such fine color bins to compare to , and we defer a comparison with the deep2 environment results of @xcite to section 4.7 .",
    "to facilitate comparisons to published clustering results measured at other redshifts or with different statistics than the two - point correlation function , we calculate the relative bias between various galaxy color samples .",
    "we define the relative bias as the square root of the ratio of  for two samples . as",
    "the relative bias is scale - dependent , we calculate the mean relative bias over two scales , @xmath199  ( all scales ) and @xmath200  ( large scales ) , which have mean scales of @xmath201  and @xmath202 , respectively .",
    "the relative bias of red to blue galaxies is @xmath203 on large scales and @xmath204 on all scales , reflecting the rise in the relative bias on small scales , @xmath155 .",
    "we do not find any dependence on luminosity for the relative bias between red and blue galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of @xcite , who measure the color - density relation at @xmath174 in vvds data and find that the color - density relation steepens for brighter galaxies .",
    "no such trend is detected here .",
    "the lack of luminosity dependence in the relative bias found here could indicate that the ratio of the satellite fraction in red versus blue galaxy samples does not depend on luminosity .",
    "@xcite show that for central galaxies there is no color - density relation ; this relation only exists for satellite galaxies .",
    "this implies that the relative bias of red to blue galaxies should be a function of luminosity if the central to satellite galaxy fraction changes with luminosity differentially for red and blue galaxies .",
    "the fact that the data show no dependence in the relative bias on luminosity could imply that the ratio of the satellite fraction in red versus blue galaxy samples is fixed and does not depend on luminosity .",
    "the relative bias of red to green galaxies is @xmath205 on large scales and @xmath206 on all scales .",
    "given that red and green galaxies have different correlation slopes and redshift - space distortions , the relative bias does not fully reflect the differences between these populations .",
    "it does , however , indicate that when two - halo - dominated scales are included , on average the clustering amplitude of green galaxies is perfectly consistent with that of red galaxies and is not lower .",
    "the relative bias of green to blue galaxies is found to be @xmath207 on both large and all scales , with no scale - dependence .",
    "the relative bias found here between red and blue galaxies at @xmath0 is very similar to what is measured at lower redshift ( see table 1 ; @xmath208 is @xmath209 % lower at @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite compare the clustering of early and late type galaxies ( defined by spectral type ) and find a relative bias of @xmath210 integrated to scales of @xmath211 , while @xcite find a relative bias of @xmath212 between red and blue galaxies .",
    "@xcite find using sdss data that the relative bias of red to blue galaxies is @xmath213 , but is highly scale - dependent .",
    "this agreement with lower redshifts implies that the dependence of color on density at @xmath62 is as steep as it is locally ; the physical mechanisms responsible for the color - density relation are just as effective before @xmath62 as they are after .",
    "the color - density relation was therefore established before @xmath62 and subsequent changes may be absolute ( in terms of the zeropoint of the relation ) but not relative ( which would change the slope ) , within the errors . as discussed in @xcite , given the low abundance of rich clusters at @xmath62 , the color - density relation seen in the deep2 data can not be the result of cluster - specific physics such as ram pressure stripping of gas or galaxy harassment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for a given cosmology we can also compute the _",

    "the cross - correlation function in the model is clearly lower on small scales ( @xmath155 ) than either the geometric mean or the deep2 data .",

    "it appears that the discrepancies shown in figures  [ mr_compare ] and [ mr_cross ] are due to the incorrect modeling of the physics that determines the colors of satellite galaxies .",
    "if too few model satellite galaxies are blue compared to the data at @xmath0 , then both the model blue auto - correlation function and red - blue cross - correlation function will have lower amplitudes on small scales than seen in the deep2 data , inside the ` one - halo ' regime ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "similarly , an overabundance of red satellites on such scales should also be present , as is seen in figure  [ mr_compare ] .",
    "a similar effect is detected at low redshift when comparing the fraction of blue sdss galaxies in groups with these millenium run semi - analytic models .",
    "@xcite find that the blue fraction of galaxies in groups is much higher in the sdss data than in the model , which predicts at @xmath161 that almost all satellite galaxies ( @xmath13985% ) are red .",
    "our results provide a valuable way to test some of the physical assumptions made by the semi - analytic model to better understand the processes that may actually be occurring and their relative importance .",
    "we identify two overly simplified aspects of the model satellite evolution that contribute to the clustering discrepancies shown in figure  [ mr_compare ] .",
    "the first is the way in which hot gas is stripped from halos ( @xmath285 ) when the halo falls into the potential of a more massive system . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the common assumption in most semi - analytic models is one of _ extreme strangulation _",
    ", where all of the hot gas is instantly stripped and added to that of the larger halo upon accretion .",
    "this simplifying assumption is important for galaxy colors because the dynamical time for a sub - halo ( and hence satellite galaxy ) to merge is usually longer than the time it takes the stellar population to fade and redden , which all model satellites will do in the absence of fresh fuel for star formation .",
    "this provides an overly - efficient channel for blue satellites to transform into red satellites .",
    "@xcite point out that the @xcite model does not include a host halo mass dependence for the strangulation efficiency .",
    "given that the ability of a parent halo to strip gas from a subhalo likely depends on the density of the hot gas in the parent halo , a model which includes such a mass - dependent strangulation prescription might provide a better match to the results shown here .",
    "the second aspect of the model satellite evolution that may be discrepant with the real universe is the assumption that local potential wells ( i.e. subhalos inside larger parent halos ) can not accrete gas , meaning that after a satellite galaxy is captured by the larger halo it receives no new baryonic fuel for later star formation from the intragroup or intracluster medium .",
    "this may be generally true in n - body simulations which show that subhalos tend to lose mass through tidal stripping as they spiral inward , not gain mass .",
    "however it is plausible that in the outer regions of a dark matter halo , the local potential of a subhalo may dominate that of its host and attract new baryons from the hot parent halo , baryons that may subsequently cool onto the satellite .",
    "such gas would extend the star formation history of the satellite and hence modify the evoution of its color .",
    "it is also important to note that there are processes that are known to operate in cluster ( and also group ) environments that act to remove cold gas from a satellite galaxy , such as tidal stripping and harassment .",
    "these processes are not included in the @xcite semi - analytic model used here ( most semi - analytic models ignore such additional effects to keep the models relatively simple ) .",
    "their inclusion would typically redden the color of the satellite further with time , worsening an effect that is already too efficient in the current model .",
    "our work indicates that current prescriptions for satellite infall and its consequent effect on star formation may be too simplistic .",
    "however , it also highlights the utility of color - dependent clustering measurements in constraining such models .",
    "in this paper we use volume - limited subsamples of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey data to measure the color and luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering at @xmath0 .",
    "we split the sample into blue , star - forming galaxies and red , nonstar - forming galaxies using the observed color bimodality in @xmath37 .",
    "we further subdivide each sample into luminosity and finer color bins .",
    "* red galaxies are much more strongly clustered than blue galaxies at @xmath0 , with a relative bias that is roughly as high as is found locally ( @xmath286 ) .",
    "this implies that , for relatively bright galaxies , the color - density relation was as strongly in place 8 gyr ago as it is observed to be today .",
    "* the comoving clustering amplitudes that we measure for both blue and red galaxies are only slightly ( 10 - 20% ) lower than what is found locally .",
    "the measured values are somewhat higher than those in previous deep2 and vvds results @xcite , though generally within 2@xmath141 . *",
    "we find no statistically - significant dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity for either red or blue galaxies , within the luminosity range that we probe .",
    "additionally , within the red sequence there is no dependence of clustering on color , while within the blue cloud there is a strong dependence on color .",
    "the color dependence and lack of luminosity dependence for both red and blue that we find is consistent with previous results at @xmath161 , for the luminosity range probed here .",
    "* the stronger dependence of clustering on luminosity found for all galaxies in the deep2 sample @xcite is likely due in part to the changing fraction of red versus blue galaxies as a function of luminosity , as we do not find as strong of a luminosity dependence here within either the red or blue galaxy populations independently .",
    "* the brightest blue galaxies have a significant rise in their correlation function on small scales ( @xmath287 ) , which likely reflects a lower satellite fraction compared to fainter blue galaxies ; i.e. , bright blue galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies within their parent dark matter halos . *",
    "the correlation between color and clustering within the blue cloud is likely a reflection of a correlation between stellar mass and halo mass .",
    "the redder galaxies in the blue cloud have higher stellar masses ( see figure 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and are significantly more clustered than the bluer galaxies , which implies that they are in more massive dark matter halos . * red galaxies show strong ` fingers of god ' at @xmath0 , indicating that they lie in virialized overdensities such as groups and clusters .",

    "the deviations are more pronounced for blue galaxies than for red galaxies . *",
    "the red - blue cross - correlation function is consistent with the geometric mean of the auto - correlation functions of blue and red galaxies separately .",
    "there is a marginal trend on small scales for the cross - correlation to lie below the geometric mean .",
    "such a feature , if real , would indicate a lack of blue galaxies near red galaxies .",
    "this could reflect a suppression of star formation in the centers of overdensities , such as groups , which are dominated by red galaxies at @xmath0 as seen in the group - galaxy cross - correlation function @xcite . * green galaxies in the valley of the observed color bimodality display a similar large - scale clustering strength as red galaxies , but show a small - scale clustering amplitude and infall kinematics akin to blue galaxies .",
    "the green galaxy population does not have strong ` fingers of god ' but does show coherent infall on large scales , and the correlation function has a similar slope to the blue galaxy population .",
    "green galaxies thus appear to be at the edges , but not in the centers , of the same overdensities as red galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with green galaxies being transition objects moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence and supports a picture of quenching happening preferentially on the outskirts of overdensities at @xmath0 on scales @xmath288 .",
    "* we provide a direct test of environment and clustering statistics , comparing the relative bias as a function of color using a local galaxy overdensity estimator with the two - point correlation function results , and find good agreement between the two . * comparing with the semi - analytic galaxy evolution model of @xcite , we find that red model galaxies are significantly more clustered than the deep2 galaxies , and that in the model the clustering strength of blue galaxies is too low , especially on small scales ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these discrepancies are likely due to galaxies being quenched too efficiently in the model ; i.e. , star formation is shut down in satellite galaxies too quickly .",
    "* these results all rely on precise , robust , spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the deep2 rms redshift errors ( determined from repeated observations ) are @xmath34 km s@xmath35 , which is unprecedented at @xmath0 and makes the  analyses presented here possible .    from the observed bias of the main red and blue galaxy samples we can infer the minimum dark matter mass for halos that host these galaxies . under the assumption that all galaxies are central galaxies and not satellites ( i.e. , one galaxy per dark matter halo ) , the large scale bias of the galaxy population can be matched to the bias of dark matter halos using the formulae from e.g. , mo & white ( 1996 ) or sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , we know that not all of the deep2 galaxies are central galaxies @xcite , and to obtain a more precise estimate of the minimum dark matter halo mass we use the results presented in the appendix of @xcite , which take into account the inferred satellite fraction from hod modeling of the deep2 luminosity - dependent clustering results @xcite . at @xmath162 , the observed bias and number densities of the main red and blue galaxy samples ( with @xmath289 ) imply minimum dark matter halo masses of @xmath290 for red galaxies and @xmath291 for blue galaxies .",
    "however , the halo occupation of red and blue galaxies is likely complicated enough to warrant a full hod model , which we defer to a future paper ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for modeling of local red and blue samples ) .",
    "the different slopes measured for the clustering of red and blue galaxies would pose a potential difficulty in terms of understanding how red and blue galaxies populate dark matter halos , if the slopes were different on large scales ( @xmath292 ) . on these scales the halo bias is linear , in that there is an amplitude offset between  for halos of different mass , but no difference in the slope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not have a large enough survey here to claim a significant difference in the slope on scales @xmath292 , though the upper left panel of figure [ wprp_all ] does suggest such a difference .",
    "it has been previously established that the number density of galaxies on the red sequence has increased since @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "it is thought that these galaxies likely migrated from the blue cloud to the red sequence as their star formation was quenched . using the observed clustering of red and blue galaxies at @xmath0",
    ", one can predict what their clustering strength should be at @xmath293 , for a given cosmology and assuming no merging of galaxies , by using the continuity equation and the expected growth of perturbations @xcite .",
    "this leads to larger predicted clustering amplitudes than is observed for local @xmath223 red and blue galaxies ; the main red and blue samples used here ( both of which have @xmath179 at @xmath162 ) would have clustering scale - lengths of @xmath294  and @xmath295 , respectively , at @xmath103 .",
    "the fact that local clustering measurements at @xmath223 are lower than these predictions , especially for blue galaxies , lends credence to the idea that blue galaxies have migrated to the red sequence and less clustered blue galaxies have joined the blue cloud since @xmath62 .",
    "the color and luminosity dependence of clustering at @xmath62 can illuminate _ which _ blue galaxies likely become red between @xmath62 and @xmath103 .",
    "the fact that the relative bias between red and blue galaxies is as high at @xmath0 as @xmath293 indicates that blue galaxies have to be turning red _ in a density - dependent way _ , in that the more clustered of the blue galaxies must become red .",
    "the bias for any galaxy population should tend towards unity with time @xcite and linear growth theory would predict that the relative bias of our red and blue samples should decrease by 8% to @xmath161 .",
    "observationally , however , it appears that the relative bias between red and blue galaxies has either remained constant since @xmath0 or increased .",
    "this therefore implies that the most clustered blue galaxies must be turning red to boost the clustering of red galaxies relative to blue galaxies and to counteract the effect of the relative bias decreasing .",
    "it is the most clustered of the blue galaxies at @xmath62 that are likely to be as clustered as red galaxies by @xmath103 , and our results here indicate that the reddest of the blue galaxies and the green galaxies are the most likely candidates for having their star formation quenched by @xmath103 , based on their clustering properties .    the luminosity dependence of clustering at @xmath0 can be explained as being almost entirely due to the relationship between luminosity and halo mass , as shown by @xcite who use a simple one - to - one relation between halo mass and light to obtain the same luminosity- and scale - dependence of clustering in an n - body simulation as we find in deep2 . the tight relation between halo mass and galaxy light",
    "is confirmed by @xcite , who fit hod models to the deep2 luminosity dependent clustering results .",
    "however , the color dependence of clustering seen here can not entirely be halo - mass dependent , as the clustering as a function of color does not match the results of @xcite , where the galaxies have been ranked by luminosity , which is equivalent to halo mass ; i.e. , the trends seen with color in the data do not match the trends found with luminosity or halo mass in the model .",
    "this implies that there is a wider range in the @xmath296 ratio of galaxies at a given color than at a given luminosity . to constrain galaxy evolution physics it may therefore be more informative to study samples divided by color rather than luminosity , as more galaxy physics",
    "is apparently needed to interpret the color dependence of galaxy clustering .",
    "the lack of a stronger luminosity dependence for the separate red and blue galaxy samples shown here makes the results of @xcite more surprising , as it is not clear why @xmath36 luminosity for all galaxies should be so tightly correlated with halo mass .",
    "it may be that the relative mix of red and blue galaxies as a function of luminosity helps to create a stronger relation with luminosity for all galaxies and is more tightly correlated with halo mass than the luminosity itself .",
    "as noted in previous papers on the color - density relation in the deep2 sample @xcite , the observed color - density relation at @xmath0 can not be the result of cluster - specific physics as only a few percent of deep2 galaxies are in massive clusters .",
    "the color dependence of clustering must be dominated by either processes that operate in a group environment or intrinsic processes that depend on the age , stellar mass or halo mass of a galaxy .",
    "processes that occur when a galaxy is accreted into a larger halo , becoming a satellite galaxy , may _ contribute _ to the observed color - density relation but do not _ dominate _ it , as most deep2 galaxies are not satellite galaxies @xcite .",

    "there are more galaxy mergers in groups than in clusters , such that mergers may play an important role in shutting off star formation in group galaxies .",
    "there is less hot ambient gas in groups than in clusters ; it is not clear whether the density of the intragroup gas is high enough to strip gas from infalling satellite galaxies , except near the core of the group .",
    "apparently not all satellite galaxies are red , as is seen in the clustering results ; this implies that there is a non - negligible timescale for quenching star formation in satellite galaxies .",
    "deep2 galaxies in groups at @xmath0 have a clustering scale - length of @xmath297  and a slope of @xmath298 @xcite , similar to red galaxies as measured here .",
    "galaxies in the field at @xmath0 have a slope of @xmath299 , similar to blue galaxies , but with a lower correlation length , @xmath300 .",
    "the cross - correlation of red galaxies and groups is higher than that of blue galaxies and groups @xcite , which also indicates that red galaxies are more likely to be in groups . however , the picture is not as simple as all red galaxies being in groups and blue galaxies being in the field : blue galaxies have some fingers of god on small scales , indicating that at least some are in virialized overdensities , and the brighter blue galaxies show a rise in the correlation function on small scales , which is probably due to a lower satellite fraction for the brighter blue samples .",
    "these galaxies are likely the central galaxies in groups at @xmath62 , and may migrate to the red sequence by @xmath293 .",
    "the scale at which the one - halo term rise occurs for these samples is small , @xmath301   ( as seen in figure [ wprp_lum_powerlaw ] ) , and indicates again that these galaxies are likely to be in the centers of the groups they reside in .",
    "additionally , @xmath302% of deep2 galaxies in underdense regions are red @xcite .",
    "the green galaxy population , which lies near the minimum in the observed color bimodality , appears to be , at least in part , a distinct population and is not a simple mix of red and blue galaxies .",
    "though the green population can include the tail of each of the blue and red distributions , it also contains transitional objects , likely moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence .",
    "the green galaxies have different clustering characteristics than either the red or blue galaxies as a whole . on large scales ( @xmath131 )",
    "the green galaxies are as clustered as red galaxies of the same luminosity , implying that they reside in the same relatively massive halos as red galaxies . on small scales",
    ", however , the clustering amplitude is similar to that of blue galaxies , which likely reflects a lower radial concentration for green galaxies compared to red galaxies .",
    "the general picture that emerges is one in which star formation quenching is occurring primarily at the edges of overdensities as galaxies fall in , turning blue galaxies green around the edges of groups .",
    "we have identified that the scale at which this transition from red to blue occurs at @xmath0 is 0.5  @xmath303 2 .",
    "this scale is just larger than the transition scale between the one - halo and two - halo terms at @xmath0 , which is shown by @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) to be @xmath11  for all galaxies and by @xcite ( see their fig . 8) to be @xmath304  for galaxies in groups .",
    "this transition scale for green galaxies is therefore similar to or just larger than the largest halos , which indicates that it is occurring at @xmath305 virial radii , on the edges of large halos .",
    "this conclusion lends support to the idea that the mechanism which shuts off star formation in these galaxies is not happening at the centers of massive halos , but on the outskirts .",
    "the comparison to semi - analytic galaxy formation models demonstrates vividly the utility of using correlation statistics to test theoretical models , and the need to test them at intermediate redshift , not just locally .",
    "it is also likely that currently popular models that have a simple halo threshold mass for quenching star formation in galaxies will suffer similar problems as the model shown here .",
    "we urge theorists to use these data to constrain their models .",
