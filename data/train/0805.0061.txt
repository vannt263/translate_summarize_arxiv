    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; stoughton et al . 2002 ) completed its first phase of operations in june 2005 , and has entered a second phase , sdss - ii , which will continue until june 2008 .",
    "one of the three surveys being carried out by sdss - ii is the sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) , which is currently mapping the structure of the milky way .",
    "segue will produce 3,500 square degrees of new images , some on a regular grid extending through the galactic plane and some sampling structures like the sagittarius dwarf tidal stream . with the information from higher to lower galactic latitudes sampled on a uniform longitudinal grid",
    ", segue will significantly improve our understanding of the thick and thin disks of the milky way , as well as of the external galaxies in the zone of avoidance .",
    "the analyses of photometric data from the lower galactic latitudes , however , will require careful step of removing the effects of the galactic interstellar extinction .",
    "one of the most common ways of estimating the amount of interstellar extinction from photometric data involves a color - magnitude ( cm ) or color - color ( cc ) diagram : one measures the amount of color excess and converts it to an extinction value by using a certain extinction law .",
    "this procedure seems simple , but care must be taken when the extinction is significant , because the amount of extinction in magnitudes of a certain photometric band depends on the detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object and is moreover not simply proportional to the amount of interstellar dust .",
    "the former effect makes the slope of the reddening vector in the cm or cc diagrams dependent on the type of the object , while the latter makes the reddening vector nonlinear .",
    "these effects arise because the transmission functions of the photometric filters have non - negligible bandwidths ( i.e. they are not dirac delta functions ) , and they hence become more important for wide - band filters .    the first thorough study on the sed dependence and nonlinearity of interstellar extinction was performed by grebel & roberts ( 1995 ; see the references therein for earlier works on these issues ) . using the kurucz models of synthetic stellar spectra",
    ", they derived color - dependent interstellar extinction relations for johnson - cousins @xmath9 and washington @xmath10 photometric systems .",
    "they found that the reddenings of main - sequence stars and evolved stars are quite different and also can be nonlinear as functions of color .    while grebel & roberts ( 1995 ) studied the reddening behaviors of individual stars in the optical bands , kim et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and kim , figer , & lee ( 2006 ) investigated the collective behaviors of the reddening for various isochrones in the near - infrared cm diagrams .",
    "they found that the reddened isochrones of different ages and metallicities behave as if they follow different extinction laws , and that the reddening vectors of some filter pairs in the cm diagrams ( particularly those in the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "nicmos ) are considerably nonlinear .",
    "they provided a so - called `` effective extinction slope '' for each filter pair and isochrone model as well as the coefficients of the third - order polynomials that best fit the reddening vectors in the nicmos cm diagrams for various isochrones .",
    "there have been some theoretical studies on the extinction properties of the sdss photometric system .",
    "schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) and stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , among others , have calculated the extinction ratios @xmath11 of five sdss bands ( @xmath5 , @xmath1 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) relative to the @xmath12 band for a normal elliptical galaxy sed .",
    "fiorucci & munari ( 2003 ) provided the minimum and maximum values of @xmath11 for several different stars .",
    "the dependence of extinction on stellar parameters and the nonlinearity of extinction for sdss bands were studied by girardi et al .",
    "( 2004 ; ggoc hereafter ) .",
    "although their main goal was to provide the theoretical isochrones in the sdss system , they also gave @xmath11 values for stars with a few different values of effective temperature @xmath13 , surface gravity @xmath14 , and metallicity [ m / h ] as well .",
    "they calculated @xmath11 values for different @xmath15 values of up to 3  mag as well , but only for one set of stellar parameters .",
    "the study by ggoc clearly shows that sed dependence and nonlinearity of extinction are non - negligible for sdss bands as well .    in the present paper ,",
    "we extend the study by ggoc and analyze the behavior of reddening in the sdss photometric system for seds of several representative galaxies .",
    "we show that the nonlinearity and the sed - dependence of the reddening is not negligible for the sdss filters .",
    "our results are to be used for correctly estimating the amount of extinction .",
    "due to the sed - dependence of the reddening , one needs to know the approximate morphology , age , and redshift of the galaxy before estimating the extinction . for cases where the spectrum or visual classification of morphology is not available ,",
    "we discuss how one could estimate such information from the photometry .",
    "this paper is composed as follows .",
    "we describe our models in   [ sec : model ] , present and discuss our calculations in   [ sec : reddening ] , and summarize our findings in   [ sec : summary ] .",
    "following fukugita et al . ( 1996 ) and ggoc , we adopt an ab magnitude system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) , which has a flat reference spectrum of flux @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 @xmath18 hz@xmath17 and a reference magnitude @xmath19 for all filters .",
    "the apparent magnitude @xmath20 , as measured using a filter with transmission function @xmath21 , is given by @xmath22 where the flux of a star measured at the top of the earth atmosphere , @xmath23 , is related to the flux at the stellar photosphere , @xmath24 , by @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the extinction in magnitudes , @xmath27 the stellar radius , and @xmath28 the distance to the star .",
    "we use the sdss filter response functions for airmass @xmath29 available from the sdss data release 5 web pages . the central wavelength @xmath30 ( defined by schneider , gunn , & hoessel 1983 as the effective wavelength ) and the bandwidth @xmath31 of sdss filters are presented in table [ table : lambda ] .",
    "when convolving the sed of isochrones and galaxies with the transmission curve , we adopt the photon integration ( eq . [ mag ] ) instead of the energy integration ( eq . [ mag ] without @xmath32 in both integrands ) as data from the charge - coupled devices would be better represented by the former .",
    "lccccc @xmath33 (  ) & 3588 & 4797 & 6232 & 7549 & 9039 + @xmath34 (  ) & 558 & 1158 & 1111 & 1041 & 1125 + @xmath35 & 0.156 & 0.241 & 0.178 & 0.138 & 0.124 +      we adopt the stellar population synthesis model by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) for the seds of simple stellar populations ( ssps ; or instantaneous - burst models ) computed using the initial mass function ( imf ) given by chabrier ( 2003 ) with lower and upper mass cutoffs of 0.1 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "then these ssps are combined to form the seds of four different galaxy morphologies , e , sa , sb , & i m , following the recipes by buzzoni ( 2005 ) .",
    "buzzoni ( 2005 ) implemented three [ fe / h ] values to build up his galaxy models but those values do not coincide with those used in the ssp models given by bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "so , we interpolate the ssp seds for the [ fe / h ] values used by the buzzoni models .",
    "figure [ fig : galspec ] shows the seds for 3 and 10 gyr template galaxies of four different morphologies constructed in this way .",
    "we adopt the extinction law by cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) for a typical galactic total - to - selective ratio of @xmath37 .",
    "they provide fitting formulae to calculate the amount of interstellar extinction at wavelength @xmath32 relative to the one at the @xmath12 filter ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "but as @xmath15 also exhibits the sed dependence and nonlinearity , we regard their extinction law as the extinction relative to the one at @xmath39   ( @xmath40 ) , which is the pivot wavelength of their extinction formulae .",
    "we find that our @xmath40 values for select synthetic stellar spectra agree with those of ggoc within 1  % ( it appears that the @xmath38 values of ggoc is defined in the same way as our @xmath40 ) .",
    "now we analyze the reddening behaviors of various galaxy models for @xmath26 values of up to 5 mag in each sdss band .",
    "we calculate how the magnitudes of our galaxy models change as we increase @xmath41 and obtain the actual extinction values , @xmath42 , for each sdss filter .",
    "then the differences and ratios between these @xmath42 values for each galaxy model determine the reddening curves in the cm and cc diagrams ( we herein use the term `` reddening curve '' instead of `` reddening vector '' to emphasize the fact that the actual reddening is not linear in the cm and cc diagrams ; we use the term reddening vector only for the `` reference reddening vector '' described below , which we mean to be linear ) .",
    "for an object whose intrinsic color can be estimated , the amount of extinction is estimated by transforming an observed color excess to the amount of extinction following a certain extinction law . it is customary to assume that the reddening is linear and not dependent on the type of the object , and the transformation is usually carried out with an assumption that a single , linear reddening vector for a given filter set can be applied to various objects with different seds . to quantify the error involved in the extinction estimation using these two assumptions",
    ", we define a `` reference extinction law '' as the amount of extinction relative to 5500   ( @xmath43 ) that an imaginary filter having a dirac delta transmission function at @xmath44 of an sdss filter @xmath7 would experience for the sed of a 10  gyr elliptical galaxy at redshift @xmath8 of 0 when @xmath45 .",
    "table [ table : ai ] gives @xmath43 values for the sdss filters and the reddening vectors calculated from this extinction law will be called `` reference reddening vectors . ''",
    "lllllll our reference & & 1.574 & 1.191 & 0.876 & 0.671 & 0.486 + schlegel et al .",
    "& & 1.579 & 1.161 & 0.843 & 0.639 & 0.453 +    the amount of extinction estimated from a calculated color excess and the reference reddening vector will be labeled by @xmath46 ( this is our `` simulated '' amount of extinction that one would estimate from observed color excess in practice when not considering the sed - dependence and nonlinearity of the reddening ) . in our analyses below , we will describe the behaviors of reddening in terms of the values @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ fig : vectorg ] shows the sed dependence and nonlinearity of the extinction in two sample cm diagrams of nine different pairs of sdss filters .",
    "the discrepancies between the actual ( symbol ) and reference ( line ) reddenings are generally larger 1 ) for the filter pairs involving the @xmath1 filter , and 2 ) for the elliptical galaxy .",
    "the former is because the @xmath1 filter has a much larger @xmath35 ratio than the other filters ( see table [ table : lambda ] ) , and this causes the central wavelength of @xmath1 to shift more significantly than the others as the extinction becomes larger .",
    "the fact that the reddening becomes noticeably nonlinear when one of the two filters has a large @xmath48 was also observed in the near - infrared cm diagrams ( see kim et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "the reason that the elliptical galaxy shows larger discrepancies is a bit more complex . in the wavelength regime of the @xmath1 filter",
    ", the elliptical galaxy has nearly flat or increasing @xmath23 with increasing @xmath32 while the irregular galaxy has decreasing @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : galspec ] ) .",
    "thus , in the limit of small extinction , the effective wavelengths , @xmath49 of the elliptical galaxy are longer than @xmath44 , and , for example , the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) reddening curve of the elliptical galaxy is shallower ( steeper ) than the reference reddening vector .",
    "conversely , for the irregular galaxy , the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) reddening curve is steeper ( shallower ) than the reference reddening vector .",
    "as the extinction becomes more significant , @xmath52 values shift to longer wavelengths , and the reddening curves for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) become shallower ( steeper ) for both elliptical and irregular galaxies .",
    "therefore , as the extinction increases , the discrepancies between the actual and reference reddenings for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 colors become larger for the elliptical galaxy but smaller for the irregular galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : vectorccg ] shows the sed - dependence and nonlinearity of the extinction in cc diagrams for four different color combinations of sdss filters . as in figure [ fig : vectorg ] , the discrepancies between the actual and reference reddenings are more significant for the color combinations involving the @xmath1 filter and for the elliptical galaxy .",
    "the behavior of the actual reddening curve relative to the reference reddening vector can be explained similarly to that in the cm diagrams . as an example , here we describe the reddening behavior in the @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 diagram in detail . in the limit of small extinction for the elliptical galaxy , the actual @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) color excess is larger ( smaller ) than the reference color excess ( because @xmath53 is larger for @xmath1 ) , and this makes the actual reddening curve in @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 cc diagram shallower than the reference reddening vector .",
    "as the extinction becomes larger , the @xmath52 of @xmath1 increases more rapidly than that of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) color excess becomes larger ( smaller ) more quickly compared to the reference color excess .",
    "this makes the actual reddening curve in the @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 diagram deviate further from the reference vector as the extinction increases .",
    "we now discuss the way the sed dependence and nonlinearity of the extinction cause errors in estimating the amount of extinction from the observed colors .",
    "figures [ fig : adiffag][fig : adiffbg ] show the differences between @xmath46 and @xmath42 in nine colors for our 1 , 3 , and 10  gyr galaxy models .",
    "@xmath46 is the amount of extinction estimated from the calculated color excess and our reference extinction law in table  [ table : ai ] .",
    "that is , @xmath46 is estimated by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the reddened magnitudes of two filters , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the subscript 0 denotes the intrinsic value , and @xmath59 is our reference extinction law between the two filters .",
    "the figures show that in general , the discrepancies between @xmath46 and @xmath42 are larger for older isochrones and colors involving the @xmath1 filter , as expected from figure [ fig : vectorg ] .",
    "this implies , for example , that applying to late - type galaxies a reddening curve calculated for an early - type galaxy may cause a non - negligible error in dereddening , particularly for colors involving @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , although the overall @xmath60 values are relatively small for colors involving the @xmath1 filter at 1  gyr , their reddening curves are nonlinear at all ages .",
    "the largest relative difference of @xmath61 between different 10  gyr galaxies is 9  % and occurs in @xmath50 between the elliptical and irregular galaxies at @xmath62 .",
    "it is worth noting that the colors between @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 show very little sed dependence and nonlinearity .",
    "this is because these filters are located near the rayleigh - jeans regime of the stellar spectra , and thus the colors between them are almost identical for all seds .",
    "the colors involving two filters whose @xmath44 s are further apart exhibit smaller sed dependence and nonlinearity ( e.g. , @xmath63 has smaller sed dependence and nonlinearity of extinction than @xmath50 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "this is because the shift of @xmath52 due to extinction becomes relatively less significant as the gap between the two @xmath52 ( or @xmath44 ) values increases .",
    "figure [ fig : adiffagz ] shows the @xmath60 values for three different redshift values ( @xmath65 , 0.1 , and 0.2 ) of four galaxy morphologies at 3  gyr .",
    "the dependence of reddening curves on @xmath8 is not negligible for @xmath8 values between 0 and 0.2 .",
    "again , the colors involving the @xmath1 filter show the largest variations of @xmath60 between different @xmath8 values .",
    "this is because the dependence of the sed slope on @xmath8 is the largest in the @xmath1 filter , which is due to the balmer break ( see fig . [",
    "fig : galspecz ] ) . as @xmath8 increases",
    ", the sed slope in the @xmath1 filter increases to a more positive value and @xmath52 shifts to a longer wavelength .",
    "thus in case of @xmath50 vs. @xmath1 ( @xmath51 vs. @xmath6 ) cm diagram , the reddening vector becomes shallower ( steeper ) and @xmath60 becomes larger ( smaller ) .",
    "the procedure for calculating the correct amount of extinction from an observed color excess is then 1 ) to obtain @xmath46 from an observed color excess and our reference extinction law in table  [ table : ai ] , and 2 ) to correct it with the corresponding @xmath60 value in figures [ fig : adiffag ] to [ fig : adiffagz ] , i.e. to subtract @xmath60 from @xmath46 .",
    "values is available from the authors upon request . ] as our @xmath46 and @xmath42 values are calculated with the redshifted spectra , any @xmath66-corrections can be applied independently from our dereddening procedures .",
    "figures [ fig : adiffag ] through [ fig : adiffagz ] can not effectively show the sed - dependence of the reddening at low extinction .",
    "this can be manifested with @xmath67 , instead of @xmath60 .",
    "figure [ fig : adiffagr ] clearly shows that the sed - dependence of the reddening is present even at low extinction and that the @xmath67 ratio is a very weak function of extinction .",
    "schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) gives the relative extinctions for the sdss filters that are calculated for a @xmath65 elliptical galaxy sed using the sdss filter response functions published by fukugita et al .",
    "these response functions are somewhat different from the most recent ones available , which are the ones adopted in the present work , and result in relative extinction values that are different from our reference extinction law by upto @xmath68  % ( table [ table : ai ] ; the difference is largest in @xmath8 while smaller than 3  % in @xmath5 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : adiffsg ] shows the @xmath60 values where @xmath46 are calculated with the relative extinctions by schlegel et al . instead of our reference extinction law .",
    "most of the @xmath60 values are negative , meaning that using the relative extinctions by schlegel et al .",
    "would underestimate the amount of extinction in most cases by @xmath2 to 10  % ( maximum @xmath3  % ) .",
    "this is because the relative extinctions by schlegel et al .",
    "have a stronger wavelength dependence compared to our values ( see eq . [ a_est ] ) .",
    "the sdss archive provides the amount of galactic extinction in @xmath6 magnitude at the position of each object that is computed following the relative extinction by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ; table [ table : ai ] ) . for the reasons discussed above",
    ", the relative extinction depends on the sed of an object and on the amount of extinction , which is not considered in the extinction values given in the sdss archive . in tables",
    "[ table : afit1 ] to [ table : afit3 ] , we provide the coefficients of the best - fit polynomials to @xmath69 as a function of @xmath41 for our 3 and 10 gyr galaxy models ( valid for @xmath70  mag ) .",
    "the fitting polynomial has a form of @xmath71 in order to correct the extinction value given in the sdss archive , one first divides the @xmath6 extinction value of the archive by 0.843 to obtain @xmath41 ( that is , @xmath15 ) , and use equation ( [ afit ] ) to obtain @xmath69 . here",
    ", 0.843 is the @xmath72 value calculated by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) using the sdss filter response functions by fukugita et al .",
    "we find that the largest correction in @xmath6 for @xmath73  mag made by this procedure is 0.09  mag , and most of the correction comes from the new filter response functions that we use . the sed - dependence and nonlinearity of the extinction results in corrections in @xmath6 of less than 0.035  mag at @xmath73  mag , which is much less than the corrections for the derredening from the color excesses discussed above .",
    "this shows that small differences in the relative extinction ( i.e. , extinction law ) result in relatively large differences in the estimated extinction from the color excess .",
