    "this paper is concerned with the inverse scattering problem of reconstructing an inhomogeneous scatterer located in an otherwise homogeneous space by measuring the corresponding electromagnetic ( em ) wave fields far away from the scatterer produced by sending some detecting em wave fields .",
    "the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem has been playing a key role in many areas of science and technology , such as radar and sonar , non - destructive testing , remote sensing , geophysical exploration and medical imaging to name just a few ; see @xcite and the references therein . in the current article , we shall mainly consider the reconstruction scheme for this inverse scattering problem .",
    "there are extensive studies in the literature in this aspect and many imaging schemes have been developed by various authors , and we would like to refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , we would like to remark that in those schemes , one either needs to make use of many wave measurements or if only a few wave measurements are utilized , then one must require that the underlying scatterer is of small size compared to the detecting wavelength . in this work",
    ", we shall consider our study in a very practical setting by making use of a single electric far - field measurement .",
    "that is , we shall consider the reconstruction by measuring the far - field electric wave corresponding to a single time - harmonic plane wave . from a practical viewpoint ,",
    "the inverse scattering method with a single far - field measurement would be of significant interests , but is highly challenging with very limited progress in the literature ; we refer to @xcite for related discussion and surveys on some existing development . for more practical considerations",
    ", we shall work in a even more challenging setting by assuming very little _ a priori _ knowledge of the underlying scattering object , which might consist of multiple components , and both the number of the components and the physical property of each component are unknown in advance .",
    "this setting would make our current study even more highly non - trivial , but on the other hand would be of significant practical importance when there is little _ a priori _ information available on the target object . before we proceed to discuss more about our results , we next present the mathematical framework that we shall work within .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded @xmath1 domain in @xmath2 which supports an inhomogeneous isotropic em medium characterized by the electric permittivity @xmath3 , magnetic permeability @xmath4 , and conductivity @xmath5 . both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive scalar functions and @xmath5 is a non - negative scalar function .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath6 is connected and @xmath7 represents the uniformly homogeneous background space . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath7 is the vacuum , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "but we would like to emphasize that all our subsequent studies could be straightforwardly extended to the case that @xmath7 is not necessarily the vacuum but uniformly homogeneous .",
    "the inverse problem that we shall consider in this paper is to recover the inhomogeneity @xmath11 by measuring the wave field far away from the inhomogeneity produced by sending a single detecting em wave . in the physical situation , the inhomogeneity @xmath11 is referred to as a _",
    "scatterer _ , and throughout we shall take the detecting / incident em wave to be the time - harmonic plane wave , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the frequency , @xmath14 the exterior product , @xmath15 the impinging direction , and @xmath16 the polarization with @xmath17 .",
    "the em wave scattering is governed by the maxwell equations , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the respective electric and magnetic fields , @xmath21 is the interior electric field , @xmath22 is known as the scattered electric field ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are their interior and scattered magnetic counterparts .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 admits the following asymptotic development with the big @xmath25 notaion @xmath26 uniformly in all directions @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 with @xmath30 is known as the electric far - field pattern . here",
    ", we would like to distinguish two cases with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "following the terminologies in the literature , in the former case , @xmath33 is called an em medium inclusion and the corresponding inverse problem is referred to as _ inverse medium scattering _ , whereas in the latter case as @xmath34 , the medium becomes perfectly conducting , and @xmath35 is called a perfect conductor or a perfectly electric conducting ( pec ) obstacle , and the corresponding inverse problem is usually referred to as _ inverse obstacle scattering_. for a perfectly conducting obstacle , both interior fields @xmath21 and @xmath36 would vanish inside @xmath0 , i.e. , the em fields can not penetrate inside the object and are governed by @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the outward unit normal vector to @xmath39 .",
    "the scattered field @xmath22 has the same asymptotic development as that in . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we shall unify the notation of denoting a scatterer by @xmath11 , which could be an inclusion by taking @xmath40 , or an obstacle by just taking @xmath32 disregarding the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    the inverse scattering problem that we consider is to recover @xmath33 from the knowledge of @xmath29 or to recover @xmath0 from the knowledge of @xmath29 if @xmath32 .",
    "we will make use of single far - field measurement , i.e. , @xmath29 for all @xmath43 but fixed @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , we shall require very little _ a priori _ knowledge of the underlying scatterer , which could be composed of multiple components , and the number of the components is not required to be known in advance , and each component could be either a medium inclusion or an obstacle .",
    "generically , in this extremely general setting , one can not expect to recover all the details of the underlying scatterer by using only a single measurement .",
    "instead , we would consider the recovery of locating the multiple components in the setting described above . nevertheless , at this point",
    ", we would like to remark that our numerical experiments indicate that our proposed imaging scheme could also qualitatively reveal the supports / shapes of the scatterer components .",
    "specifically , two single - measurement locating schemes would be proposed for two separate cases depending on the size of the target scatterer .",
    "the first scheme is for locating scatterers of small size compared to the wavelength of the detecting plane wave .",
    "the multiple scatterers could be extremely general with very little _ a priori _ knowledge required .",
    "each scatterer component could be either an impenetrable perfectly conducting obstacle or a penetrable inhomogeneous medium with an unknown content , and the number of the scatterer components is not required to be known in advance .",
    "the locating scheme is based on a novel indicator function @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath48 happens to be the location point of a scatterer component , then @xmath48 is a local maximum point for @xmath46 . using the indicating behavior of @xmath46 , one",
    "could then locate all the scatterer components . in defining the indicator function , only inner - products of the electric far - field pattern and",
    "the vectorial spherical harmonics are involved . the indicating behavior",
    "is derived from the asymptotic expansion of the electric far - field pattern for small ` point - like ' scatterers .",
    "the expansion is further based on the low frequency em scattering asymptotics ( i.e. , raleigh approximation ) ; see @xcite .",
    "but for our imaging scheme , the expansion would be formulated in terms of the vectorial spherical harmonics instead of the polarizability tensors .",
    "it is also interesting to mention that our numerical experiments show that the proposed scheme also works effectively for locating ` partially - small ' scatterer , namely , the scatterer is not ` point - like ' but ` line - segment - like ' .",
    "furthermore , in addition to finding the locations of the scatterer components , the proposed scheme also shows some very promising feature in qualitatively imaging the supports / shapes of the unknown scatterers .",
    "our second scheme is for locating multiple perfectly conducting obstacles whose sizes are comparable to the detecting em wavelength . for this case , we would require that the shape of each component must be from a certain known admissible class .",
    "that is , there might be multiple obstacles with an unknown number of components , but the shape of each obstacle component must be from a certain class of reference obstacles which is known in advance .",
    "nevertheless , there could be multiple different reference obstacles .",
    "other than the assumptions made above , no further _ a priori _ information is required for the multiple unknown scatterers .",
    "the number of the unknown scatterer components could be larger than the number of the reference obstacles ; that is , some of the unknown scatterers possess the same shape .",
    "moreover , it is not necessary for all the reference obstacles to be presented in the unknown scatterer .",
    "the setting considered would be of significant practical interests , e.g. , in radar and sonar imaging .",
    "the second imaging scheme is based on @xmath49 indicator functions , where @xmath50 denotes the number of the reference obstacles .",
    "similar to the first imaging scheme , in calculating the indicator functions , only inner products are involved and no inversion will be required .",
    "the proposed method is very efficient and robust to measurement noise , and could also be extended to include inhomogeneous medium components if certain generic condition is satisfied . to our best knowledge , this is the first imaging scheme in the literature for locating multiple unknown scatterers of regular size by a single em far - field measurement .",
    "rigorous mathematical justifications are provided for both schemes . in our theoretical analysis",
    ", we would impose the sparse distribution of the scatter components .",
    "however , we have conducted extensive numerical experiments , and numerical results show that even without the sparsity assumption , our proposed locating schemes still work very effectively .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we develop the locating schemes , respectively , for the two separate cases with small scatterers and regular - sized scatterers .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the proofs of theorems  [ thm : main1 ] and [ thm : main2 ] stated in section 2 to justify the indicating behaviors of the indicator functions for the two locating schemes proposed in section 2 . in section 4 ,",
    "we present extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods .",
    "the work is concluded in section  [ sec : conclusion ] with some further discussions .",
    "in this section , we shall develop the two schemes for locating , respectively , multiple scatterers of small size and regular size . in order to ease the exposition , throughout the rest of the paper , we assume that @xmath51 , and hence the size of a scatterer can be expressed in terms of its euclidean diameter .",
    "we first introduce the class of small em scatterers for our current study .",
    "let @xmath52 and let @xmath53 , @xmath54 , be bounded @xmath1 domains in @xmath2 .",
    "it is assumed that all @xmath53 s are convex and contain the origin . for @xmath55 ,",
    "we let @xmath56 and set @xmath57 each @xmath58 is referred to as a scatterer component and its content is given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are all constants , except the case that @xmath63 . as remarked in section  [ sec : intro ] , if @xmath60 is taken to be @xmath64 , then @xmath53 would be regarded as a perfectly conducting obstacle disregarding the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the sequel ,",
    "we shall reserve the letter @xmath67 to denote the number of components of a scatterer defined by @xmath68 the parameter @xmath55 represents the relative size of the scatterer ( or , more precisely , each of its component ) .",
    "we now make the following qualitative assumptions , @xmath69 the assumption means that compared to the wavelength of the detecting / incident wave , the relative size of each scatterer component is small and if there are multiple components , they must be sparsely distributed .",
    "our numerical experiments in section 4 could be more quantitative in this aspect , and it is numerically shown that if the size of the scatterer component is smaller than half a wavelength and the distance between two distinct components is bigger than half a wavelength , one could have a fine reconstruction by using our proposed scheme . in this sense , the qualitative assumption   is needed only for our subsequent theoretical analysis of the proposed locating scheme .",
    "furthermore , we would like to emphasize that most of the other restrictive assumptions introduced above are also mainly for the purpose of the theoretical justification , and the numerical experiments in section 4 will show that our proposed imaging scheme works in a much more general setting . specifically , the regularity of each reference component @xmath53 is not necessarily @xmath1-smooth , and it could be a lipschitz domain , and moreover , it is not necessarily convex and not even simply connected , as long as it contains the origin and @xmath70 for a small @xmath55 yields an appropriate domain of small size .",
    "moreover , the content of each medium component is not necessarily constant , and it could be variable",
    ". some of those restrictive assumptions could be relaxed from our theoretical justification in the following .",
    "however , it is our focus and emphasis on developing the locating scheme in the present work , and we would not appeal for a most general theoretical study .    in the sequel , without loss of generality , we can assume that there exists @xmath71 , @xmath72 such that @xmath73 then , we set @xmath74 to denote , respectively , the medium component and the obstacle component of a scatterer . we emphasize that both @xmath67 and @xmath49 are unknown in advance , and @xmath49 could be @xmath75 or @xmath67 , corresponding to the case that @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , the contents and the shapes of the two components are unknown in advance either and they are not even necessarily identical to each other , i.e. , @xmath78 corresponding to a single em detecting plane wave , the electromagnetic scattering is governed by the following maxwell system @xmath79 it is known that there exists a unique pair of solutions @xmath80 to the maxwell equations ( see @xcite ) . in the following",
    ", we shall write @xmath81 to denote the electric far - field pattern corresponding to the em wave fields in . we shall also write for @xmath54 , @xmath82 to denote the far - field pattern corresponding solely to the scatterer @xmath83 .",
    "both @xmath84 and @xmath85 are real analytic functions on the unit sphere @xmath86 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "next , we introduce the space of @xmath87 tangential fields on the unit sphere as follows , @xmath88 note that @xmath89 is a linear subspace of @xmath90 , the space of vector @xmath87-fields on the unit sphere @xmath86 . in addition , we recall the vectorial spherical harmonics @xmath91 which form a complete orthonormal system in @xmath89 . in ,",
    "@xmath92 with @xmath43 , @xmath93 are the spherical harmonics of order @xmath94 , and @xmath95 denotes the surface gradient operator on @xmath96 .",

    "we define @xmath98 and @xmath99 where @xmath47 , and @xmath100 . clearly , @xmath101 is a real number , whereas @xmath46 is a real - valued function depending on the point @xmath47 .",
    "we are now ready to present the first main result of this paper , whose proof will be postponed to the next section .",
