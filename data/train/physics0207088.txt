    "axicons are a family of cylindrical symmetrical optical systems that produce a line focus rather than a point focus from incident collimated beammcleod54 .",
    "there are several types of axicons , working either by reflection or by transmission , and being either converging or diverging , but the most common one is probably the conical lens . such a lens is a cone made with a material of index @xmath0 , and a basis perpendicular to its main @xmath1 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ) .",
    "an incident collimated beam , propagating along the @xmath1 axis , is deviated towards the main axis of the lens , with an angle @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the base angle of the cone .",
    "@xmath4 is usually a small angle , typically few degrees or less . beyond the lens ,",
    "two zones must be distinguished : in the first one , just after the lens , all deviated beams spatially coexist partially ( in the hatched zone of fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ) , resulting in a diffraction - free beam . beyond this zone",
    ", beams deviated along different directions do not overlap any more , and the intensity becomes distributed on a ring .",
    "such hollow beams have recently regain interest , in the perspective of their use in optical trapping of atoms@xcite and bose - einstein condensateswright2000 .    .",
    "the propagation axis is the @xmath1 axis , with its origin at the axicon vertex .",
    "after the conical lens , the beam is globally deviated towards the @xmath1 axis with an angle @xmath5 .",
    "point v is on the axicon vertex , while point x corresponds to the abscissa @xmath6 where a hole appears in the center of the beam in geometrical approximation .",
    "the hatched zone between v and x is the bessel zone . for @xmath7",
    ", the hollow beam has a radius @xmath8 and a thickness @xmath9.,width=377 ]    these applications require specific properties , as e.g. a zero intensity in the center of the beam , as predicted by the diffraction theorybelanger78 .",
    "however , in most of the experimental realizations , the obtained pattern is more complicated : a usual observed defect is a drastic asymmetry of the distribution with a tail towards the center , possibly secondary rings and thus a non zero intensity at the center@xcite .",
    "practically , this leads to the need of a mask to clean the inner region of the hollow beam , and thus a loss of light power and additional diffraction effects , which are both major inconveniences in the experimental uses of such hollow beams .",
    "the source of these differences with respect to the theory is not clearly identified .",
    "as the conical lens vertex plays a central role in the transverse distribution of the hollow beam , it is natural to search for the origin of these defects in the properties of this point , in particular by taking into consideration its real shape . in the present paper , we study the modifications induced by the bluntness of the conical lens vertex on the hollow beam transverse shape .",
    "we show in particular that the ratio between the transverse size of the incident beam and the size of the blunt area determines the transverse distribution , and that an adequate choice for this ratio allows us to either minimize the losses or optimize the distribution symmetry .",
    "[ fig : schema ] describes schematically the geometrical beam propagation through a conical lens .",
    "the diffraction - free zone appears between the conical lens vertex v , and the point x where all deviated beams separate .",
    "the spatial distribution of the light field in this zone is the superimposition of the interferences between deviated beams and diffraction on the conical lens vertex v. the transverse distribution of the resulting field follows a bessel function@xcite .",
    "its exact nature depends on the shape of the incident beam .",
    "for example , an appropriate incident laguerre - gaussian beam is able to generate a high - order bessel beam of arbitrary order@xcite .",
    "the main interest of bessel beams is that they propagate without diffraction , i.e. their intensity transverse profile remains invariant upon propagation on macroscopic distances@xcite .",
    "bessel beams produced by axicons have been extensively studied , within the framework of numerous applications , such as second - harmonic generationarlt99 , optical parametric generator @xcite , and atom trapping @xcite .    beyond point",
    "x , i.e. for @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the radius of the incident beam , all deviated beams separate ( in the geometrical approximation ) , and a hole with radius @xmath13 appears in the center of the beam .",
    "@xmath14 is the distance between the @xmath1 axis and the ray crossing the conical lens vertex , while @xmath15 is the thickness of the ring ( @xmath16 in the present case ) .",
    "it is also practical to define the radius @xmath17 of the ring , with @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "fig : schema ) .",
    "such hollow beams are fundamentally different from hollow laguerre - gaussian modes .",
    "first , in the last ones , the circulation of the phase around the pattern center is equal to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the angular index of the mode , while in the axicon hollow beam , it is equal to that of the incident beam , i.e. zero in the case of a plane wave or a tem@xmath21 mode .",
    "this phase variation has no consequence on the intensity transverse distribution , but is critical in field dependent systems , e.g. if the hollow beam interferes with another beam .",
    "the second point concerns directly the intensity distribution : the axicon hollow beam can be realized with arbitrary ratio between the radius and the thickness of the beam , as both quantities depend differently on @xmath1 , while in laguerre - gaussian modes , this ratio is fixed by the laguerre polynomial distribution and does not vary with @xmath1 , except of course if it is transformed by an axicon@xcite .",
    "axicon hollow beams can be used in different applications , from laser machining@xcite to optical traps for cold atoms@xcite and bose - einstein condensates@xcite .",
    "in practical realizations , incident beams are often produced by a laser , and thus are gaussian beams . in that case , the incident beam can not be considered as collimated , but is characterized by a waist @xmath22 where the beam spot size is minimum . to control the waist location and size , a convergent lens is usually inserted before the conical lens . in particular ,",
    "it is easy with such a doublet to locate the waist after the conical lens .",
    "[ fig : schema2 ] shows the propagation of a collimated incident beam through a convergent lens followed by a conical one , in the geometrical approximation . as for collimated beams , an incident ray at the distance @xmath23 from the @xmath1 axis ,",
    "is deviated with an angle @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the focal length of the convergent lens .",
    "we can also define a distance @xmath27 such that for @xmath10 , a hole appears in the center of the beam . for thin lenses ,",
    "a simple calculation leads to @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the distance between the two lenses . as in the single conical lens case , @xmath30 and @xmath15 , which now depend both on @xmath1 ,",
    "can be easily calculated .",
    "in particular @xmath31 has the same value as in the single conical lens scheme .",
    "the point focus in f is transformed in a ring focus of radius @xmath32 ,  at location f@xmath33f , where f is the focus point of the convergent lens ( the interval between both points is in @xmath34 ) .",
    "if the gaussian properties of the incident beam are taken into consideration , all these quantities becomes indefinite , as the transverse expansion of a gaussian beam is theoretically infinite .",
    "however , for large incident beams ( i.e. @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the incident beam size at @xmath37 and @xmath38 the wavelength ) , the geometrical approach remains a good approximation .",
    "therefore , the above expressions , where @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath36 , can be used , keeping in mind that they concern @xmath37 intensity limits .     where a hole appears in the center of the beam .",
    "the hatched zone between v and x is the bessel zone.,width=377 ]    this geometrical approach is unable to describe thethickness @xmath15 of the ring . to evaluate it ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account the diffraction of the beam during the propagation , and in particular on the conical lens vertex .",
    "such a theory shows that when the convergent conical lens doublet is illuminated by a gaussian beam , the transverse distribution of the ring at the waist location , is also gaussian , symmetrical with respect to the @xmath39 circle @xcite .",
    "its thickness at @xmath37 is @xmath40 , comparable to the beam waist @xmath41 produced by the converging lens without axicon .",
    "the field amplitude of the wave after the lens is given by the usual fresnel approximation to the kirchhoff integral : @xmath42where @xmath43 is the wavelength and @xmath44 is the wave vector .",
    "@xmath45 is the complex amplitude of the field in point @xmath46 of the observation plane , @xmath47 the incident field in point @xmath48 of the diffraction plane and @xmath49 the transmission function of point @xmath48 .",
    "the integration is done on the whole diffracting surface @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 is the optical distance between @xmath48 and @xmath52 , and thus @xmath53 depicts the spherical wave expanding out from point @xmath48 .",
    "the inclination factor @xmath54 depicts the angle of the incident and diffracted beams with the normal to the surface @xmath50 . for small apertures and paraxial beams ,",
    "it is approximated by @xmath55 , so that eq .",
    "[ int1 ] becomes : @xmath56the transmission function depends of course on the considered optical elements .",
    "it is @xmath57 and @xmath58 for respectively a lens and a conical lens :    [ trans ] @xmath59    where @xmath23 is the distance from point @xmath48 to the optical axis , @xmath26 is the focal length of the lens and @xmath0 the optical index .",
    "eqs [ trans ] do not take into account a fixed phase shift induced by the thickness of the lenses .    to compute the field amplitude after the conical lens and compare it with experimental measurements ,",
    "we directly evaluate eq .",
    "[ int2 ] through a standard integration software , without any additional approximation .",
    "experimentally , we used a commercial conical lens from bern optics , with @xmath60 and a radius of 5 mm .",
    "it is in bk7 glass with an optical index @xmath61 .",
    "the incident gaussian beam , provided by a laser diode with @xmath62  nm , has a waist @xmath63  @xmath64 m , so that it can be considered as collimated , and we have @xmath65 .",
    "the signal is detected through 2d and 1d ccd cameras , and therefore we record the _ intensity _ of the pattern rather than its field amplitude .",
    "thus the comparison between experimental and numerical results is performed through the intensity transverse distribution .",
    "let us first illustrate the limits of the present model with a spectacular example : we consider the transverse distribution of the experimental beam described above , at a distance @xmath66 after the conical lens .",
    "[ fig : diff ] shows the experimental ( dashed line ) and theoretical ( full line ) intensity distributions .",
    "while the ring diameters are identical , it is clear that the present model is unable to reproduce the details of the distribution . in particular",
    ", the experimental profile shows a thin main ring , with inner contrasted secondary rings , looking like diffracting rings . on the contrary ,",
    "the model predicts a unique thick ring , slightly modulated by diffraction .",
    "thus it is clear that the diffracting elements are not treated correctly in the model .",
    "after the axicon , obtained when the incident beam , with a waist @xmath67  @xmath68 m , crosses a unique conical lens .",
    "the theoretical profile corresponds to the modelization of the axicon with a ponctual vertex .",
    "the vertical scale corresponds to the theoretical curve , when the total light power is @xmath69 mw . units for the experimental curve are arbitrary.,width=377 ]",
    "to enhance the model , we take into consideration the bluntness of the conical lens vertex , by introducing an hyperbolic correction to the conical lens shape ( fig . [",
    "fig : hyperb ] ) .",
    "we introduce the radius of curvature @xmath70 of the hyperbole , so that the thickness @xmath71 of the lens is : @xmath72where @xmath73 is the thickness of the lens for @xmath74 , i.e. when the vertex is a point . to evaluate the radius of curvature @xmath75 of our actual conical lens , we use a fit to adjust experimental and theoretical intensity distributions .",
    "the best fit , corresponding to @xmath76  mm , leads to a satisfying concordance between experiments and theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "the remaining differences between both curves concern the amplitude of the secondary rings , but not their number neither their location .",
    "we have also applied our model to non collimated beams , i.e. when the conical lens is used with a convergent lens . as shown on fig . [",
    "fig : fitdoublet ] , the transverse distribution of the beam after the doublet is well reproduced .",
    "therefore  the hyperbolic approximation of the vertex appears to be good enough to predict and optimize the use of an axicon to produce a hollow beam .    , with @xmath76  mm .",
    "the origin of @xmath1 is the conical lens vertex.,width=377 ]    , except that the theoretical profile corresponds to the modelization of the axicon with the shape of fig .",
    "fig : hyperb.,width=377 ]     after the axicon , obtained when the incident beam , with a waist @xmath67  @xmath68 m , crosses a convergent conical lens doublet .",
    "the convergent lens has a focal length @xmath77  mm , and is located at @xmath78  mm .",
    "the theoretical profile corresponds to the modelization of the axicon with a rounded vertex .",
    "vertical scales as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff].,width=377 ]    fundamental differences appear between the present configuration and the predictions of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the beam size in the focal plane is almost @xmath79 times larger than expected ( fig . [",
    "fig : compare]a ) .",
    "if this broadening is effectively linked to the curvature of the conical lens vertex , we expect that it decreases when the incident beam waist increases .",
    "[ fig : compare]b shows that indeed , if @xmath36 is increased significantly , the width of the ring becomes similar to that predicted in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : wvsz ] shows how the ring thickness , measured at @xmath37 of its maximum intensity , evolves as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "typically , three zones can be defined , delimited by the values @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the main peak of the distribution is in @xmath86 , as it is typical for the bessel zone . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the thickness is almost constant , with @xmath88 , where @xmath22 is the minimum waist of the single convergent lens , in the focus plane , and @xmath89 is the value predicted in @xcite . in the third zone , referred as expanding zone in the following , and corresponding to @xmath90 , @xmath15 grows almost linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "this behavior is very different from that expected . in particular ,",
    "the narrowest intensity distribution is not in the focus plane , but in the constant zone , just after the bessel area .",
    "however , the smaller ring thickness corresponds to that predicted by @xcite in the focus plane , although it occurs outside the focus plane .    .",
    "the width is measured at @xmath91 .",
    "the dashed line is the value predicted in the focus plane in @xcite .",
    "@xmath92 is the abscissa of the focus plane.,width=377 ]    but the main novelties of our model concern the shape of the transverse distribution of the intensity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib ] , very different shapes are obtained in the constant and expanding zone . in the constant zone ,",
    "the external narrow ring is accompanied by several secondary rings located inside the main one , and separated by dark rings . in the immediate proximity of the bessel zone ,",
    "the minimum of the dark rings is almost zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib]a ) , and it increases as the expanding zone is approach ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib]b ) . at the edge of the constant and expanding zones ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib]c ) , the contrast between secondary and dark rings vanish , so that in the expanding zone , the transverse distribution may be described by one single asymmetric ring with a tail towards its center .",
    "the resulting pattern in the expanding zone seems to be more clean , but it requires the use of a mask to suppress the intensity at the center of the ring , leading to new diffracting distortions of the pattern . on the contrary , in the constant zone , and in particular in the proximity of the bessel zone ( in @xmath93 ) , a mask adjusted to the first dark ring cleans the pattern to the single external ring , without additional distortion .",
    "the resulting pattern is a single narrow ring with two stiff sides .",
    "thus the constant zone appears to be the most appropriate to produce clean hollow beams .    ,",
    "( b ) @xmath94 , ( c ) @xmath95 and ( d ) @xmath96 .",
    "all @xmath23 axes have the same absolute scale , from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "vertical scales as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff],width=377 ]    another important aspect in the experimental realization of hollow beams is either the total light power inside the final beam , or the peak intensity of the ring .",
    "the first point depicts the losses introduced by the mask , while the second one is linked to the thickness of the ring .",
    "if the mask is placed at its optimal location @xmath93 , as described above , it introduces losses of 22% , corresponding to the part of power distributed in the secondary rings .",
    "this value have to be compared to that obtained when the mask is placed in the focus plane , as suggested in @xcite . in this case , the losses depend naturally on the mask radius , and thus of the ring thickness . to obtain a thickness comparable to that in @xmath93 ,",
    "we introduce 40% of losses . to reduce losses to 22% ,",
    "it is necessary to increase the thickness by a factor 2.3 : it is clear that the use of a mask in @xmath93 produces narrower rings with less losses . as a consequence , as it can be easily realized by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : compare]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib]a , the peak intensity of the ring in almost four times larger in @xmath93 than in @xmath99 .",
    "so from the energetic point of view also , the technique described above leads to a substantial gain .    in the whole preceding discussion ,",
    "we have emphasized one given configuration , with a lens with focal length @xmath100 , with a distance @xmath101 between the lens and the axicon .",
    "the conclusions apply of course to other values of @xmath26 and @xmath29 . as an example , we illustrate in fig . [",
    "fig : pattern ] the hollow beam obtained for a different set of parameters , using the above technique .",
    "the resulting pattern is a single ring with a stiff inner border , and losses introduced by the mask are measured to be @xmath102 , in good agreement with the theory .     for the converging conical lens , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 . in ( a ) , without the mask ; in ( b ) , with a 2 mm mask.,width=377 ]",
    "we have shown that taking into account the curvature of the conical lens vertex leads to an accurate description of the beam transformation through a conical lens and a convergent conical lens doublet .",
    "calculations are in excellent agreement with the experiments .",
    "we show that the use of a mask allows to obtain an excellent quality hollow beam , assuming that the mask is located adequately , just after the bessel zone .",
    "the quality of the hollow beam consists in a single regular ring , with an intensity going abruptly to zero on its inner side , and no residual intensity in the center of the ring .",
    "this enables the use of such beams in interferometric experiments , as e.g. in the realization of optical lattices@xcite . in most of the applications",
    ", the present system will win in convenience if a second conical lens , located just after the bessel zone of the first one , is added to the convergent conical lens doublet .",
    "indeed , the second axicon will rectify the phase surfaces and fix the ring radius versus propagation .",
    "a third conical lens before the doublet may be added to control independently @xmath105 and @xmath106@xcite .",
