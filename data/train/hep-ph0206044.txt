    "there is a limited number of known ways to seek physics beyond the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions .",
    "increasing collision energies in laboratory experiments might reveal new particles",
    ". there may be small effects or rare processes at low energies",
    ". there might be particles of such high mass that they could not be created in the laboratory but have survived from an early , high - temperature epoch in the universe .",
    "recently there has been evidence for new physics in the second category : the strong experimental indication of neutrino flavor oscillations , which imply small but nonzero neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "this evidence encourages further pursuit of other phenomena , including proton decay , which like neutrino mass is not forbidden by some established principle such as gauge invariance .    during a period of ( unsuccessful ) search for baryon number non - conservation in large underground detectors , the question arose whether the rearrangement of hadronic degrees of freedom required for decay might substantially inhibit the process .",
    "it was suggested that such ` hadronic quenching ' might account for several orders of magnitude suppression of baryon decay @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical studies guided by the neutrino masses and by the assumption of ` grand unification ' of electroweak and strong interactions at some high scale have led to new predictions of baryon decay , involving different dominant channels from those first discussed , and smaller coefficients for the effective four - fermion operators generating the decay @xcite . evidently ,",
    "if there were several orders of magnitude further suppression due to hadron dynamics , the prospects for experimental observation would be dim .",
    "accordingly , it seems timely to make a more systematic and quantitative approach to the issue of hadronic suppression , and we attempt that here .    in principle one would like to carry out a path - integral computation over the qcd degrees of freedom , starting with a nucleon and ending with a meson and lepton .",
    "however , this remains a daunting task , because there is such poor quantitative control on the properties of qcd in exactly this regime , phenomena involving energy scales of the same order as @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , as in the earlier work , we use instead skyrme s ansatz @xcite for the nucleon as a topological soliton of the chiral field , and to provide more microscopic realism allow a bag to occupy the interior region of the skyrmion , with three valence quarks inside it .",
    "this is the hybrid chiral bag model @xcite . to describe hadronic tunneling in the initial @xmath2 and final @xmath3 states",
    ", we take a single collective variable , the value of the chiral angle at the bag boundary radius @xmath4 , where , for the skyrmion in equilibrium , the angle would be @xmath5 , halfway between the values @xmath6 at spatial infinity and @xmath7 at the origin .",
    "we estimate the tunneling action by using the skyrme ansatz throughout space , constraining the ansatz by imposing varying values for the chiral angle at @xmath4 .    assuming that the formulation is exactly correct in every respect except that we are restricting the tunneling to only the single variable of the chiral angle at the fixed boundary of the bag",
    ", the result of this calculation should be a lower bound on the hadronic matrix element of the four - fermion operator which reduces baryon and lepton numbers each by one unit .",
    "it is a lower bound because taking account of more degrees of freedom should only increase the tunneling probability , barring cancellations due to opposing phases .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite it was suggested from crude dimensional considerations that the tunneling between a final , trivial vacuum state and a configuration of the chiral field with topological number zero but mass equal to the nucleon mass could be equivalent to the motion of a particle with gev mass through a gev potential barrier of thickness about 1 fm .",
    "this immediately gives a suppression factor @xmath8 in amplitude or @xmath9 in rate .",
    "tunneling in the initial @xmath2 state was ignored .",
    "what we find now is that both the initial and final state tunneling factors are relatively large , meaning that the skyrme ansatz indicates a soft degree of freedom associated with change of the chiral angle at the bag radius , either for fluctuations about the vacuum as in the final state ( which consists of vacuum plus a departing meson and lepton ) , or for fluctuations about the @xmath10 initial state .",
    "put differently , quantum fluctuations of the vacuum are easily generated in which objects appear which consist of a quarter skyrmion outside the radius @xmath4 and a quarter anti - skyrmion inside ( or vice versa ) .",
    "in addition , fluctuations of a skyrmion are easily generated in which one quarter of the baryon number shifts inside ( or outside ) the radius @xmath4 .",
    "these are not the only modifications from a traditional ( mit bag @xcite ) estimate of baryon decay . because the radius of the chiral bag boundary is about half that of the mit bag",
    ", one must pay attention to dimensional dependence of the four - fermion - operator matrix element on the volume which bag wave functions of quarks occupy . also , the wave functions for the valence quarks take a different form as the chiral boundary angle varies from the case for chiral boundary angle @xmath6 , as in the mit bag .",
    "all these effects are taken into account in what follows .",
    "we begin by defining the matrix element to be estimated , then determine the initial and final state tunneling factors , and end by putting in factors for the initial quark and final meson and lepton wave functions .",
    "it will be seen that the calculation is nearly identical for the old dominant channel , @xmath11 , and for the channel favored in more recent calculations @xmath12 , except for the larger mass and hence lower final velocity of @xmath13 compared to @xmath7 , and the gamma matrices appearing in the four - fermion operator , neither of which alters the hadronic tunneling .",
    "our conclusion is that , because of the large spontaneous chiral fluctuations , hadronic tunneling implies at most a quite minor suppression of baryon decay .",
    "the proton decay amplitude for @xmath14 in terms of initial and final state wave functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 is @xmath17 where `` initial '' means a skyrmion with topological number one and `` final '' means vacuum with topological number zero .",
    "further , @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the inhibition factor due to hadron dynamics that will be calculated in the next section .",
    "the integration variable @xmath20 accounts for the quantum fluctuations ( to be defined below in terms of separate scaling variables , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , for the initial and final state wave functions , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath23 s in eq.([eq : idef ] ) do not show an @xmath24-dependence because that has already been integrated out in the skyrme model we use , also to be discussed below .",
    "however , @xmath25 does include a phase factor @xmath26 , not shown , because the initial chiral field wave function has the mass of the nucleon , @xmath27 , while the final ( vacuum ) wave function has exactly zero energy .",
    "this factor assures that the total energy of the final lepton and meson will be the mass of the initial nucleon .",

    "this might be one more example of the `` cheshire - cat '' phenomenon @xcite , that many properties of the nucleon are quite insensitive to the choice of demarcation radius between a chiral field description ( used outside that radius ) and a description in terms of quarks ( inside ) , subject to an appropriate chiral boundary condition .",
    "if so , then even the decay of the proton may not reveal what lies inside it , instead quite directly measuring the microscopic operator behind the decay .    in this work we have not focused on the matrix element for production of the final meson from the remaining quark and the produced antiquark .",
    "independently of the hybrid bag picture , this might be a worthwhile subject for additional study , and probably is the largest source of remaining uncertainty in the lifetime calculation . assuming this",
    "also does not produce a large effect , then the latest quoted limits on both the old @xmath193 and new @xmath194 favored channels for proton decay already provide ominous constraints on grand unified models @xcite .",
    "shmuel nussinov was an active partner in the early stages of this work , and he was the first to suggest that a more careful look might reveal much less substantial hadronic suppression of baryon decay than the old , but crude , arguments had indicated .",
    "our further efforts have more than vindicated that view . this research is supported in part by the department of energy under contract w-7405-eng-36 ."
