    "several different approaches have shown by now that the quantum mechanical spectra of black hole observables ( such as area , charge and angular momentum ) are discrete @xcite . among them , the reduced phase space quantisation technique of barvinsky et al @xcite confirms an earlier conjecture by bekenstein and collaborators that the area spectrum of quantum black holes is indeed discrete as well as _",
    "@xcite . the last property makes a rather interesting prediction that hawking radiation from black holes will have a noticeably discrete spectrum , which can have interesting experimental consequences @xcite .",
    "the results were extended to the case of charged black holes , which yielded a separate discrete spectrum for the electric charge .",
    "the area spectrum was slightly more complicated in this case , although the uniform spacing property remained intact .",
    "these spectra were re - derived from algebraic approaches in @xcite .",
    "recently the above formalism was extended by gour and medved to rotating ( uncharged ) black holes in four spacetime dimensions @xcite ( and to rotating charged black holes in @xcite ) .",
    "they showed that the corresponding area spectrum is also discrete and equispaced : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are non - negative integers . while @xmath1 signifies the departure of the black hole from extremality",
    ", @xmath2 measures the classical angular momentum of the black hole . in this paper",
    ", we extend their formalism to include @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4 black holes as well as @xmath5 and higher dimensional myers - perry type rotating black holes with multiple angular momenta parameters .",
    "we show that while the area spectrum is discrete in each case , in general it is not equispaced .",
    "in particular , the @xmath3 and @xmath5 dimensional black holes have a non - uniform area spectrum .",
    "we also show that this makes hawking radiation from these black holes continuous , as opposed to the discrete radiation spectrum characteristic of black holes of uniformly spaced area .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we review some thermodynamic properties of the @xmath4 black hole and derive the quantum mechanical spectra of its area and angular momentum . in section ( [ 5sec ] )",
    ", we consider the @xmath5-dimensional rotating black hole with @xmath6 angular momentum parameters and derive the corresponding spectra .",
    "then in section ( [ 6sec ] ) , we derive the area spectrum for six and higher dimensional black holes , whose area spectum is shown to be quite distinct from black holes in lower dimensions . in section ( [ hrsec ] )",
    ", we study the implications of the area spectrum that we found for hawking radiation , and show that in most cases the radiation spectrum is a continuum , _ unlike _ that for four dimensional black holes .",
    "we conclude with a summary , some open questions as well as some observations regarding adiabaticc invariants in quantum gravity in section ( [ conclsec ] ) .",
    "first , let us consider a btz black hole , which is a solution of three dimensional einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant @xmath7 .",
    "its horizon radii , area , entropy , hawking temperature , angular velocity and the first law of black hole mechanics that it satisfies are given by @xcite r_&= & ^1/2 + a & = & 2r_+ + s_bh & = & = 4r_+ + t_h & = & = + &= & + dm & = & t_h  ds_bh +   dj  , where @xmath8 is the surface gravity at the horizon and following @xcite we have assumed that the three dimensional newton s constant @xmath9 . in the extremal limit @xmath10 one has : m = j  ,  ( r_+ ) _ extr = =  ,   a_extr =  ,   s_extr = 2  , where we have assumed @xmath11 without loss of generality .    to derive quantum mechanical spectra , we start with the complete set of commuting observables @xmath12 and their conjugates @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath14 has the interpretation of difference between schwarzschild times across a spacelike slice extending from the left to the right wedge of a kruskal diagram , following @xcite , we impose the periodicity condition : _m ~_m +  , to incorporate the thermodynamic nature of the system under consideration .",
    "next , we make the following transformation to a new set of phase space variables @xmath15 which automatically incorporate the above periodicity : x & = &  ( _m ) + p_x & = &  ( _m )  , where @xmath16 is an hitherto unknown function",
    ". computation of poisson bracket yields : \\{x , p_x } = from ( [ 1st ] ) it follows that if the function @xmath16 is chosen such that : b(m , j ) = s(m , j ) + f(j ) = 2a(m , j ) + f(j )  , where @xmath17 is arbitrary , then the above poisson bracket becomes unity and the transformation @xmath18 is indeed canonical . with this choice , squaring and adding ( [ x1 ] ) and ( [ x2 ] ) , we get : x^2 + p_x^2 =  .",
    "noting that for a given @xmath19 , since the horizon area @xmath20 can not be less than @xmath21 given in ( [ btzextr ] ) , it follows that @xmath22 , the @xmath15 phase space has a ` hole ' centred at the origin and with radius @xmath23 removed from it .",
    "although this gives rise to quantisation ambiguities , these can be eliminated by the following unique choice of @xmath24 : f(j ) = - 2  , such that : b(m , j ) = 2a(m , j ) - 2 and x^2 + p_x^2 = - 2  .",
    "quantisation is now straightforward with the replacements : @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the lhs of ( [ sho1 ] ) is recognisable as the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator of mass@xmath27 and angular frequency @xmath28 .",
    "this results in the following spectra for entropy and horizon area : a - = ( n + )  .",
    "next , the quantisation of angular momentum follows from the usual identification in @xmath3-dimensions : @xmath29 , resulting in eigenfunctions : @xmath30 with eigenvalues @xmath31 .",
    "thus the final spectrum of area is : a = ( n + + )  ,  n , m=0,1,2 ,  where it is understood that the area above ( and in subsequent sections ) is measured in planck units .",
    "note that it is discrete , but _ not _ equispaced .",
    "it will be shown in section ( [ hrsec ] ) that this will have important consequences for hawking radiation .",
    "also note that @xmath32 ( no rotation ) reduces the above spectrum to the equispaced spectrum conjectured in @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the non - rotating case , or those that result from the recent identification of black hole quasi - normal modes with hawking radiation frequencies ( see e.g. @xcite ) , eq.([btzspec1 ] ) does not have the multiplicative factor of @xmath33 or @xmath34 in front .",
    "moreover , our ` ground - state area ' is non - vanishing , suggesting that the the end stage of hawking radiation is a planck sized remnant .",
    "the above two features are generic for black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions , as will be seen in subsequent sections .",
    "we now extend our results to five - dimensional rotating black holes .",
    "as suggested from the approaches in @xcite and in the previous section , the first step towards quantizing black hole horizon area is to find a set of mutually commutating operators and their conjugates . a naive extension of the analysis in the preceeding section fails for @xmath35 , since the different components of angular momenta fail to commute .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite this problem can be readily cured by replacing the usual angular momentum components by the euler components of angular momentum , which mutually commute @xcite . here",
    "we extend that analysis to @xmath36 black holes which has _ two _ rotation parameters @xcite .",
    "the key observation that makes this possible is that the relevant rotation group @xmath37 is isomorphic to @xmath38 . defining the rotation and lorentz generators in @xmath5-spacetime dimensions : @xmath39 where , @xmath40 their commutation relations follow : @xmath41 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{l}_k , \\qquad   [ \\hat{l}_i , \\hat{k}_j ] = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{k}_k , \\qquad   [ \\hat{k}_i , \\hat{k}_j ] = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{l}_k \\ ; .\\ ] ] next , defining two new angular momentum operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 it can be shown that @xmath45 = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{j}_{1k } , \\qquad   [ \\hat{j}_{2i } , \\hat{j}_{2j } ] = i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{j}_{2k } , \\qquad [ \\hat{j}_{1i } , \\hat{j}_{2j } ] = 0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] giving two copies of the @xmath46 algebra . accordingly , defining two copies of the analogs of euler components of the angular momenta , @xmath47 , as follows : @xmath48 where the six coordinates @xmath49 are @xmath5-dimensional analogues of euler angles in four dimensions .",
    "finally , we define the two ` classical angular momenta ' : @xmath50 + j_{\\beta_1}^2 \\la{eu5.1 } \\\\ j_{2cl}^2 = j_{21}^2 + j_{22}^2 + j_{23}^2 = \\frac{1 } { \\sin^2 \\beta_2 } [ j_{\\alpha_2}^2 + j_{\\gamma_2}^2 - 2 \\cos \\beta_2 j_{\\alpha_2 } j_{\\gamma_2 } ] + j_{\\beta_2}^2   .",
    "\\la{eu5.2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the above two angular momenta are related to the ones that enter the five dimensional black hole metric in the following way @xcite : j_&= & 12 ( j_1cl + j_2cl ) + j_&= & 12 ( j_1cl - j_2cl ) which in turn defines the parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 as : j_&= & 23 m a + j_&= & 23 m b  , implying : j_1cl & = & 23 m ( a + b ) + j_2cl & = & 23 m ( a - b )  .",
    "the two horizons are roots of the equation @xmath53 the resulting thermodynamic quantities are ( with @xmath54 ) : 2 r_^2 & = & - a^2 - b^2 + a & = & + s_bh & = & + t_h & = & = + _&= &   + _&= &   + dm & = & t_h  ds_bh +  _  dj",

    "thus , from ( [ arb2 ] ) it follows that that the horizon area in the extremal limit is : @xmath57 now , it can be seen from ( [ eu5.1])and ( [ eu5.2 ] ) that @xmath58 commutes with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for @xmath61 .",
    "thus , one can choose as canonical variables the following set : @xmath62 with the corresponding conjugates @xmath63 respectively . as before ,",

    "the distinction between that case and the current one lies in the difference in the functional form of extremal entropy and the resulting difference that arises on quantisation .",

    "remarkably , angular momentum plays no role in area spectrum in @xmath99 , and the above spectrum is _ identical _ to the neutral black hole spectrum found in @xcite .",
    "the hawking radiation spectrum is not the same however , as will be shown in the next section .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate other physical significances that this equispaced spectrum might have .",
    "an important consequence of a strictly equispaced area spectrum is a markedly discrete spectrum for hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "consider for example the area spectrum of a @xmath68 schwarzschild black hole .",
    "using @xmath100 , the lowest hawking radiation frequency @xmath101 emitted due to a transition of this black hole from an excited state to its next lower state ( @xmath102 from ( [ area6 ] ) ) is given by : _0 = |m| = = = 2t_h and all higher frequencies will be multiples of the above .",
    "comparing with wien s law for frequency of maximum intensity of blackbody radiation : _max t_h  , we see that the @xmath103 .",
    "thus there will be only a few visible spectrum lines in hawking radiation _ even for a macroscopic black hole _ , leading to the aforementioned conclusion .",
    "the qualitative picture remains unchanged for reissner - nordstrm black holes as well @xcite .",
    "next we examine the impications for rotating black holes .      in this case",
    ", it follows from ( [ btzspec1 ] ) that for an emitted quantum of hawking radiation : s_bh = 2a = 2  . replacing @xmath104 and plugging in the expression for @xmath105 from ( [ btzomega ] ) in the first law ( [ 1st ] ) , we get : _0 = 2t_h  n + m next , consider an emission line for which @xmath106 and @xmath107 , and the black hole to be ` macroscopic ' , for which @xmath108 .",

    ", we get : _0 = 2t_h ( |n| + ) + where we have assumed without loss of generality that @xmath112 . as for btz , consider an emission characterised by : @xmath106 ( signifying @xmath113 remaining unchanged ) and concentrate on the second term within the parenthesis , since the last term is in any case negligible for very large @xmath89 .",
    "we see that for any given @xmath114 if m_1 = ( ) m_2   ( ) m_2  , then _0 = 2  t_h 0 notice however that both @xmath115 .",
    "this implies , along with ( [ 5dhr1 ] ) and @xmath116 , that @xmath117 . that is , unless the two angular momentum parameters are hugely disproportionate , such that the second inequality in the above is violated ( or when @xmath75 or @xmath76 ) , the radiation spectrum is a quasi - continuum , as was the case in three dimensions . since these black holes are natural candidates in certain brane world scenarios , it is possible that the above observations will have experimental signatures from the four dimensional ( brane ) point of view .",
    "from ( [ area6 ] ) and the first law , we get : _0 = 2t_h",
    "n +  m  .",
    "note that , as for @xmath68 schwarzschild black holes , the first term implies a discrete spectrum .",
    "but unlike that case , here an additional parameter @xmath118 ( @xmath119/2 $ ] in general ) enters the problem . recalling that there is no extremality bound for @xmath99 , if the black hole is such that @xmath120 and the black hole to be macroscopic , then for @xmath106 , @xmath121 , we have : _0 =  0 .",
    "it is easy to see that similar conclusions will follow for @xmath122 as well as @xmath123 .",
    "thus we see that the single angular momentum kerr black holes in @xmath99 shows continuous hawking spectrum in spite of the area spectrum being equispaced .",
    "it remains to be checked whether this property holds even if we include more angular momentum parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have extended an earlier formalism by barvinsky et al , adapted to kerr black holes by gour and medved to include rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions .",
    "this was done in three steps .",
    "first , the method was applied to @xmath3-dimensional @xmath4 black holes with one angular momentum parameter , where the observables @xmath20 and @xmath19 were mutually commuting .",
    "second , it was applied to @xmath5-dimensional rotating black holes with two angular momentum parameters . using the fact that the corresponding rotation group @xmath124 , and using the technique of @xcite in which the cartesian components of angular momentum are replaced by the mutually commuting euler components",
    ", we were able to quantise the the two angular momentum components and arrive at the spectrum of horizon area of these black holes .",
    "finally six and higher dimensional black holes were studied with one angular momentum parameter , since this was sufficient to demonstrate its essential difference with lower dimensional black holes ,    the horizon area spectra for the above black holes were found to be quite different from that in @xmath68 . in particular , we found that both for @xmath125 and @xmath5 the spectrum is no longer equispaced ( except for the special case when the two angular momentum parameters were equal in @xmath36 ) .",
    "a direct consequence was that hawking radiation spectrum from these black holes are practically continuous ( for large black holes ) , as opposed to the distinctly discrete spectrum predicted for @xmath68 black holes which can carry angular momentum or charge .",
    "the situation was even more interesting for @xmath95 , in which case although the spectrum turned out to be equispaced , the hawking radiation retained its continuous nature . although it may seem that there is an additional discrete spectrum for all the cases considered when @xmath126 , this does not affect our conclusions in any way , since the superposition of a discrete and a continuous spectrum is a continuum , the greybody factors being the same for each case .",
    "such closeness of radiation spectra from higher dimensional black holes with the semi - classical hawking analysis may lead one to speculate that brane world black holes are more fundamental , since hawking s result is expected to be valid for macroscopic black holes .",
    "in fact one of the proposed brane world scenarios requires the spacetime dimension of our universe to be at least six @xcite , for which we have seen that interesting conclusions follow for rotating black holes .",
    "however , further investigations are required before arriving at a definitive conclusion . in any case ,",
    "phenomenological implications of our higher dimensional results seem worth investigating .",
    "we conclude with an observation related to _",
    "adiabatic invariants _ in quantum gravity .",
    "motivated by some thought experiments , it was conjectured by bekenstein that black hole horizon area is an adiabatic invariant in quantum gravity , i.e. it remains unaffected by small changes in black hole parameters .",
    "in @xcite an explicit proof of this conjecture was presented for spherically symmetric uncharged black holes , while in the presence of a charge @xmath127 it was shown that @xmath128 was an adiabatic invariant .",
    "we show here that a similar result follows . for periodic systems",
    ", it is well known that the quantity : p_x dx is an adiabatic invariant , where @xmath129 are usual phase - space coordinates @xcite .",
    "it follws that for harmonic oscillator like hamiltonians as in ( [ sho1 ] ) , ( [ sho51 ] ) and ( [ sho61 ] ) , the corresponding adiabatic invariants are : & = &  ( btz ) + & = &  ( d=5 ) + & = &  ( d 6 )  .",
    "note once again that as for charged black holes , upto @xmath36 , the ` excess - area ' above extremality is an adiabatic invariant , while for @xmath86 , the horizon area itself is the invariant , as conjectured by bekenstein",
    ". it will be interesting to study the most general case of charged and rotating black holes to see what the adiabatic invariants are for such a system .        ya . i. kogan jetp lett .",

    "<S> the reduced phase space formalism for quantising black holes has recently been extended to find the area and angular momentum spectra of four dimensional kerr black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this further to rotating black holes in all spacetime dimensions and show that although as in four dimensions the spectrum is discrete , it is not equispaced in general . as a result , hawking radiation spectra from these black holes are continuous , as opposed to the discrete spectrum predicted for four dimensional black holes . </S>"
