    "an isospin analysis of @xmath13 decays to three - kaon final states by belle  @xcite and independent analysis with moments technique  @xcite by babar  @xcite suggest the dominance of the @xmath16-even component in the @xmath130 decay ( after the @xmath131 signal is excluded ) .",
    "this conclusion can be checked independently by an amplitude analysis of the @xmath132 final state , where the fraction of @xmath16-odd states can be obtained as a fraction of states with odd orbital momenta .",
