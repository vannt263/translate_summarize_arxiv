    "in recent years , ab - initio methods based on density - functional theory have been shown to have predictive power in the field of thermal structural phase transitions .",
    "in particular , first - principles calculations within the local - density approximation ( lda ) have been able to reproduce ferroelectric and other instabilities in perovskite oxides such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite these ab - initio calculations correctly predict a low - symmetry distorted ground state and the eigenvector of the associated distorting mode . moreover , the ab - initio exploration of the energy around this ground state for the relevant degrees of freedom allows , in general , a parametrization of the obtained energy map as an effective hamiltonian .",
    "thermal effects investigated through monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations restricted to this effective hamiltonian show a fair agreement with experiment",
    ".    however , the field of temperature - driven ferroelastic phase transitions , where some spontaneous strain component can be identified with the order parameter ( proper ferroelastic ) or is bilinearly coupled with it ( pseudoproper ferroelastic ) , represents a particular challenge for first - principles calculations .",
    "density - functional methods are known to have accuracy problems when reproducing elastic properties , while in ferroelastics the elastic energy plays a fundamental role in the structural instability .",
    "we report here the results of an ab - initio study of the ferroelastic instability in @xmath0 based on the density - functional theory within the lda .",
    "a brief preliminary account was presented in ref .  .",
    "to our knowledge , this is the first study of this type in a ferroelastic temperature - driven system , and can be considered a benchmark of the capability of these ab - initio methods to reproduce ferroelastic structural instabilities .",
    "the case of @xmath0 is particularly simple : having a rutile - type structure , it undergoes a tetragonal - orthorhombic transition which is well characterized as pseudoproper ferroelastic.@xcite the order parameter is one - dimensional and the eigenvector of the unstable optic mode is fully determined by symmetry arguments .",
    "this allows an investigation of the origin of the structural instability by considering only a few degrees of freedom of the structure . in comparison with the case of the ferroelectric perovskites ,",
    "another simplifying feature is the fact that the unstable mode is non - polar , so it is not necessary to include long - range dipolar interactions in any subsequent modeling of the relevant degrees of freedom as a local - mode effective hamiltonian .    in this work",
    ", the existence of an orthorhombic ( slightly distorted rutile structure ) ground - state of the system is explored , and the total energy is parametrized as a function of the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "special emphasis is put on a comparison of the resulting energy map with a temperature dependent landau potential , and the resulting experimental behavior .",
    "we also investigate the importance of other secondary degrees of freedom .",

    "this is in fact the symmetry of the orthorhombic spontaneous strain @xmath29)/2 .",
    "the tetragonal high - temperature structure has also a single optical mode of @xmath26 symmetry , which according to spectroscopic observations strongly softens as the temperature is lowered and causes the structural instability.@xcite thus , the case of @xmath0 is a textbook example of a pseudoproper ferroelastic transition , where the actual order parameter @xmath30 is the amplitude of an optical mode , while the spontaneous strain , being of the same symmetry , is bilinearly coupled to it .",

    "the deviation between pw and lapw , both using the lda , is most likely caused by the different treatment of the ca-3@xmath21 semi - core states : indirectly through the use of non - linear core corrections in pw , and properly in lapw .",

    "the tendency of the @xmath26 mode to be rather soft can be qualitatively explained by its `` quasi rigid - unit '' nature .",

    "therefore , our results indicate that this non - classical slope ratio must have a quite different origin . in this respect , it is quite interesting to compare the values of @xmath119 at 0  k extrapolated from the experimental linear behavior of @xmath113 , below @xmath120 ( see fig .  [",

    "using the calculated structural parameters listed in tables [ table1 ] and [ table4 ] we see that in the absolute orthorhombic minima @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , which agrees fairly well with the calculated strains from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) . from the calculated atomic positions of the chlorine atoms we also obtain the amplitude of the @xmath26 mode , @xmath171 bohr and the @xmath44 mode , @xmath172 bohr .",
    "the energy difference between the orthorhombic and tetragonal structures is @xmath173 mhartree , to be compared with the depth of the minima , @xmath174 mhartree , from eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "hence , these results are consistent with the ground state that we have found considering the energy expansion given by eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) with errors of the order of @xmath175 .",
    "we have found it useful to look at the issue of the ferroelastic instability in @xmath0 from the point of view of the analysis of energy - volume curves , traditional in the field of first - principles calculations .",
    "apart from the consideration of the two phases involved in the transition , a question which comes to mind is whether there might be other structures that could compete for stability with the experimentally observed @xmath0 structure .",
    "a good candidate is the cubic fluorite structure , with the anions placed in a tetrahedral environment and an eightfold coordination of the cations , which is the stable arrangement for the chemically similar compound @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations in this section are carried out using the the highly accurate all - electron lapw method , which for the structural properties of @xmath0 yields essentially the same results as the pw code , as has been shown in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] , but is in principle more suitable to analyze small energy differences between structures .",
    "we have computed the energy - volume curves for @xmath0 in the rutile - type ( t ) , the @xmath0-type orthorhombic ( o ) , and the fluorite - type cubic ( c ) structures , and show them in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_v_cacl2 ] .",
    "the asterisks under c , o , and t mark the equilibrium volumes per formula unit ( 468 , 520 , and 535 bohr@xmath167 , respectively ) .    to put the case of @xmath0 in perspective",
    ", we have performed a similar analysis for @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : e_v_srcl2 ] shows the total - energy curves for the same three structure - types as for @xmath0 .",
    "the minimum of the total - energy curve for the fluorite - type cubic structure is located at 531 bohr@xmath167 , to be compared with the observed experimental value of 574 bohr@xmath167 .",
    "the difference can be attributed to the use of the lda .",
    "the @xmath0-type orthorhombic structure is very similar to the rutile - type tetragonal structure .",
    "so , it was to be expected that the energy difference is small both in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 ( 0.48 and 0.54 mhartree / f.u . , respectively ) . in both cases the energies continuously merge as the volume increases , since the @xmath26 optic mode becomes stable and the distortions disappear .",
    "this is the signature of a group - subgroup symmetry - breaking transition in an energy - volume diagram .",
    "srcl@xmath5 in the rutile - type structure would have an unstable @xmath26 mode similar to cacl@xmath5 , including the negative grneisen parameter .    in @xmath0 ,",
    "the three structures have very similar energies .",
    "the fluorite - type cubic structure is more stable than the rutile - type tetragonal structure ( the energy difference is 0.38 mhartree / f.u . ) .",
    "so , the cubic and tetragonal structures are competitive and only the orthorhombic distortion reduces the energy by an additional 0.1 mhartree / f.u . below the cubic one . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_v_cacl2 ] , a very small pressure would be enough to transform @xmath0 into the denser fluorite - type cubic structure .",
    "this small energy difference has led us to re - do the calculation with the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for exchange and correlation.@xcite in this case the fluorite - type structure is about 8 mhartree / f.u .",
    "higher than the tetragonal one , significantly increasing the critical pressure .",
    "this finding is consistent with the work of zupan _ _",
    "e__t al.@xcite on the stishovite / alpha - quartz phase transition in sio@xmath5 , which showed that the compressed phase is too stable within the lda , whereas the gga corrects for this over - binding of the lda and thus agrees better with experiment . in that paper",
    "it was argued that it is a general feature of the lda to favor more compact ( isotropic ) structures , while the gga enhances charge inhomogeneities and thus stabilizes the higher - volume and lower - symmetry phase .",
    "the present case is another example of this general behavior .    in srcl@xmath5",
    ", the ground state of the system corresponds to the fluorite - type cubic structure , in accord with the experimental observation .",
    "the energy difference with respect to the orthorhombic structure ( within the lda ) is 9.88 mhartree / f.u .",
    ", much larger than in the case of cacl@xmath5 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the non - bonding forces between the cations .",
    "the corresponding potential grows steeply at short distances due to strong repulsive forces .",
    "for this reason the relative energies are sensitive to the first - neighbor ca - ca and sr - sr distances . in srcl@xmath5",
    "the cations in the tetragonal structure are very close to each other and thus raise the total energy . in cacl@xmath5",
    ", however , the cations are not so close and thus the corresponding energy difference between the structures is relatively small .",
    "ab - initio calculations within the lda approximation without volume corrections are sufficient to reproduce the main features of the ferroelastic instability in @xmath0 . our analysis of the energetics of the crystal confirm a pseudoproper ferroelastic mechanism with an unstable optic mode as the microscopic origin of the experimental phase transition .",
    "the elastic instability arises due to the coupling between this soft @xmath26 optic mode and the orthorhombic spontaneous strain @xmath63 .",
    "the existence of qrums in the rutile - type framework structure has been shown to play an essential role as well .",
    "the calculated orthorhombic ground state agrees fairly well with the experimental low temperature structure .",
    "we have identified and calculated the anharmonic terms which have relevance in the determination of the ground state .",
    "the secondary degrees of freedom have been also considered .",
    "our energy - map calculations rule out the relevance of higher anharmonic couplings proposed in previous literature to explain the ratio of the slopes of the squared frequencies .",
    "although the system modifies its ground state noticeably when volume / strain corrections are considered , the lda approximation has been sufficient for obtaining a realistic picture of the microscopic mechanism of this temperature driven ferroelastic system .",
