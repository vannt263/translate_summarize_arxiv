    "there is a wide scatter in the @xmath3 estimates from the @xmath17 ratios around 1020 @xmath112 , but the @xmath138 ratios give consistent results over this range , appearing to favour @xmath1520.5 .",
    "even the point giving the largest value of @xmath3 ( @xmath153 at @xmath126 ) favours @xmath154 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in both sets of simulations , the @xmath138 ratio at this scale provides an estimate of @xmath3 within 1 sigma of the correct value .",
    "therefore @xmath6 would seem to be a reasonable upper limit allowed by our analysis and we conclude that either @xmath155 or that galaxies are significantly biased tracers of the mass distribution , @xmath156 .",
    "as an aside , we note that the small - scale , non - linear , behaviour of @xmath3 for the stromlo - apm survey is markedly different to that of the simulations , which have a systematically negative @xmath3 and smaller errors on scales @xmath157 .",
    "we are not overly concerned by this as the simulations provide a relatively poor fit to observed clustering on small scales and we know that equation ( [ eqn : beta_sr ] ) is clearly not to be trusted in regimes in which it predicts a negative @xmath3 !      ideally , of course , one would like to know the values of the density parameter @xmath1 and the bias parameter @xmath2 individually .",
    "cole  ( 1994 ) have discussed how it may be possible with future redshift surveys to separate the determination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 by studying the scaling of non - linear effects .",
    "an alternative approach is the study of high order correlations to constrain the ( possibly non - linear ) biasing model using weakly non - linear perturbation theory .",

    "however , the observations are very well fit by an _ unbiased _ , low - density cdm model with @xmath9 . applying occam s razor ,",
    "this seems the more natural solution .      despite the uncertainties in the value of galaxy bias with respect to the mass , one may study the _ relative _ bias of galaxies of different type by comparing their clustering properties .",
    "there are two independent ways to measure the relative bias factors : ( 1 ) by comparing real - space clustering in the linear regime and ( 2 ) by measuring the redshift space amplification of clustering due to equation  ( [ eqn : beta_sr ] ) .",
    "one thus has a consistency check on measurements of @xmath3 and relative bias parameters .",
    "we have already compared the clustering of galaxies of different luminosity and morphological type in paper  2 . in that paper we concentrated on the small - scale ( power - law ) regime of galaxy clustering . here",
    "we study clustering in the linear regime .",
    "we analyse galaxy subsamples from the stromlo - apm survey of low , middle and high luminosity , and of early and late type .",

    "the error bars are determined from the one sigma scatter in @xmath160 from the nine bootstrap - resampled versions of the survey data . given that our estimates of @xmath36 are unreliable beyond @xmath67 , we see no obvious trend of relative bias with scale in the linear regime .",
    "we have therefore calculated the maximum - likelihood value of @xmath160 over the range 512 @xmath112 , a regime over which the assumption of linear bias seems reasonable and where our measurement errors are not too large .",

    "we also show the relative bias @xmath161 measured at a separation of @xmath162 in this table .",
    "we see that low - luminosity galaxies ( sample b ) , are only about one third as strongly clustered as middle - luminosity galaxies , in accordance with the findings of paper  2 .",

    "we have used large and realistic @xmath4-body simulations to investigate the effects of non - linearity on two estimators for the quantity @xmath3 ( eqs .  [ [ eqn : beta_02 ] ] and [ [ eqn : beta_sr ] ] ) in low and high density models .",
    "we find that non - linearity affects the 2nd order spherical harmonic @xmath177 of redshift space clustering to scales as large as @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast , the amplitude of the direction - averaged correlation function @xmath178 is only weakly affected by non - linearity on scales @xmath179 in the lcdm model and @xmath180 in the mdm model .",
    "therefore the most practical method for constraining @xmath3 with existing redshift surveys is by measuring the amplification of direction - averaged redshift space clustering over real space clustering .",

    "a reasonable upper limit on @xmath3 from this analysis is @xmath6 .",
    "given that the @xmath165 estimates on either side of @xmath170 are almost consistent with @xmath182 , we regard our analysis as providing an _ upper limit _ of @xmath6 , rather than an actual estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "although a little lower than estimates of @xmath3 from peculiar velocity analyses ( eg .",
    "hudson  1995 , who find @xmath183 ) , the largely unknown systematic errors in most current estimates of @xmath3 means they are all fairly consistent .",
    "see or for a review of recent measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "the stromlo - apm survey is a powerful sample for constraining @xmath3 since the large volume probed enables us to reliably measure redshift space galaxy clustering in the linear regime , whereas many previous analyses have been limited to measuring @xmath35 in the non - linear regime .",
    "cross - correlation with the fully - sampled apm galaxy survey enables us to measure @xmath36 much more accurately than using the angular correlation function @xmath184 , and thus the technique of using the ratio @xmath122 [ or @xmath123 ] comes into its own for this survey .",
    "the most likely source of systematic error in this analysis is in the inversion of the projected correlation function @xmath186 to obtain the real space correlation function @xmath36 .",
    "comparison of the @xmath3 determinations from the simulations using @xmath36 measured directly from the simulations and via inversion of the projected correlation function (  [ sec : nsim_sr ] ) suggests that any such error is comparable to or smaller than random errors .",
    "with linear theory and 2-point clustering statistics alone one can not separate the contributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath187 .",
    "however , as gaztaaga and frieman ( 1994 ) have discussed , higher order correlations may be used to constrain biasing models .",
    "their analysis of apm galaxies favours a linear bias parameter @xmath9 , although to be strictly self - consistent , one should allow for a non - linear bias model in non - linear perturbation theory , in which case one can always match the observed skewness of apm galaxy counts in cells by adjusting the non - linear bias parameters .",
    "further work is clearly required in constraining possible biasing models .",
    "as we have seen in paper  2 , different classes of galaxy have different clustering properties , and so not all galaxies can have exactly the same biasing parameter .",
    "in particular , low - luminosity galaxies are about three times less strongly clustered than @xmath11 galaxies on large scales , and so @xmath188",
    ". an interesting test would be to see if high order clustering of low - luminosity galaxies also predicts a lower value of bias than for @xmath11 galaxies .    in conclusion ,",
    "we find that a relatively low value of @xmath3 is favoured by the stromlo - apm data ; our results appear to rule out an unbiased , @xmath189 model .",
