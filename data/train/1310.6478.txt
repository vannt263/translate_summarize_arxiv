    "it is generally assumed that collisions of relativistic heavy - ions lead to the formation of a deconfined high temperature and density state of nuclear matter , the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the new phase of matter exists for a short time after the collisions and ultimately hadronizes into final - state particles .",
    "considerable efforts have been put into identifying observables that are sensitive to the properties of the early deconfined stage of the collisions .",
    "strangeness enhancement , one of the first proposed signatures of the deconfined phase@xcite , has been commonly considered to be an important probe of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy - ion collisions .    by exploiting the tracking and particle identification capabilities of alice , strange ( @xmath2 , k@xmath3 ) and multi - strange ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) particles can be detected via their weak decay topologies and measured over a wide range of transverse momenta . in this report",
    "we present the latest alice results on strange ( @xmath2 , k@xmath3 ) and multi - strange ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) production in pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 tev . in the next section ,",
    "we present transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectra measured at mid - rapidity ( @xmath7 ) as function of centrality .",
    "we discuss in the third section the evolution of @xmath8 ratio as a function of @xmath1 , in comparison with the corresponding results in pp collisions at the lhc and in @xmath9 gev au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "the excitation function of the strangeness enhancement from sps to lhc energies is discussed in the fourth section . in the fifth section ,",
    "the nuclear modification factors for multi - strange particles are compared with other identified particles to provide insight into particle production and energy loss mechanisms at play .",
    "the alice experiment@xcite , dedicated to study heavy - ion physics at the lhc , has excellent particle identification capability .",
    "strange and multi - strange particles were reconstructed via their weak decay channels : @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) . the combinatorial background contribution to the invariant mass distributions of the candidates for all species",
    "was reduced by applying cuts selecting specific decay topologies and using information on the specific energy loss in tpc of their decay daughters .",
    "the signal was extracted , for each particle in each @xmath1 interval , by subtracting from the peak population the background , which was estimated by a first or second order polynomial fit .",
    "acceptance and efficiency was estimated via a monte - carlo study and applied to correct the signals .",
    "the @xmath2 yield was further corrected for feed - down contributions from weak decays of @xmath4 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 contribution being negligible ) .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra of strange and multi - strange particles are shown for different centrality classes in pb - pb collisions at @xmath10 tev in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , respectively .",
    "when compared with the peripheral and pp results , @xmath8 and p@xmath20 ratios were observed to be enhanced at intermediate @xmath1 in central heavy - ion collisions at both rhic@xcite and sps@xcite .",
    "these observations suggested that other hadronization mechanisms , such as coalescence , may open up in the deconfined medium created in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "indeed , the so - called `` baryon anomaly '' could be qualitatively explained if hadrons were formed by recombination of two or three soft quarks@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] ( left ) shows the @xmath8 ratios as a function of @xmath1 for different centralities in pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 tev@xcite . for comparison , also shown in the plot are the ratios measured in pp collisions at @xmath21 and 7 tev .",
    "the ratio in pp collisions always stays far below 1 and appears to be insensitive to the collision energy .",
    "while the ratio in the most peripheral pb - pb collisions is compatible with that measured in pp collisions , at intermediate @xmath1 it increases with collision centrality and develops a maximum at @xmath22 gev/@xmath23 reaching a value of about 1.6 for the 0 - 5% most central pb - pb collisions .",
    "however , at @xmath24 gev/@xmath23 , the @xmath8 ratio appears to be independent of collision centrality and very similar to that measured in pp collisions .",
    "this suggests that the production of @xmath2 and @xmath25 at high @xmath1 , even in central pb - pb collisions , could be dominated by vacuum - like fragmentation of energetic partons .",
    "a comparison between lhc and rhic measurements on @xmath8 ratios is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig3 ] for the most central ( 0 - 5% ) and peripheral ( 60 - 80% ) nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath26 are plotted for the star measurements in au - au collisions at @xmath9 gev considering that the anti - baryon / baryon ratio is about 0.8 instead of @xmath27 observed at lhc . as can be seen from the comparison ,",
    "although the magnitude of the ratio is similar , the position of the maximum seems to shift towards higher @xmath1 as the collision energy increases , suggesting a stronger radial - flow effect at higher collision energy .    also shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are theoretical model calculations for the most central collisions .",
    "as can be seen , the viscous hydrodynamical model@xcite describes the data well up to @xmath1 about 2 gev/@xmath23 but deviates progressively at higher @xmath1 .",
    "a recombination model calculation@xcite can approximately reproduce the shape , but overestimates the magnitude of the data by about 15% .",
    "the epos model@xcite , which takes into account the interaction between jets and the hydrodynamical medium , appears to describe the data reasonably well .",
    "strangeness enhancement , defined as the enhancement of the relative yield per participant in nucleus - nucleus collisions to that in pp or p - be collisions , was proposed in the 1980s as a signature of a phase transition to quark - gluon plasma which was expected to take place in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions@xcite .",
    "indeed , the enhancement of strangeness was observed in heavy - ion collisions at the sps@xcite and rhic@xcite . in particular , the enhancement is more pronounced for multi - strange baryons and decreases as the collision energy increases .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the enhancements for multi - strange baryons in pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 tev , as a function of the mean number of participants , in comparison with the corresponding measurements by na57 at sps@xcite and star at rhic@xcite .",
    "the enhancement increases with centrality and with the strangeness content of the particles as observed already at lower energies , but decreases with increasing energy , following the trend observed at lower energies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the production of multi - strange particles in heavy - ion collisions does increase with collision energy from the sps to the lhc .",
    "however , the increase of the multi - strange yields in smaller colliding systems ( pbe or pp ) used as reference , appears to be slightly faster@xcite , resulting in the less pronounced enhancement than at lower energies .",
    "when an energetic parton traverses the hot dense qcd medium created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , it suffers large energy loss due to gluon radiation and multiple scatterings .",
    "this parton energy loss is expected to lead to a modification of energetic jets ( jet quenching)@xcite , which should be reflected in the @xmath1 spectra of hadrons , originating from the energetic partons produced in initial hard collisions . to quantify the medium modification of the measured hadron yield in nucleus - nucleus ( a - a ) collisions , it is compared to the expectation from an independent superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions ( binary collision scaling ) by introducing the nuclear modification factor : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the particle yield in a - a collisions , @xmath30 the cross - section of particle production in pp collisions , and @xmath31 the geometric nuclear overlap function . in the absence of any nuclear modification to the incoherent hard processes , the nuclear modification factor at high @xmath1",
    "is expected to be unity according to the binary collision scaling .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows @xmath32 as a function of @xmath1 for multi - strange baryons in most central and most peripheral pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 tev",
    ". for comparison , also plotted in the figures are the nuclear modification factors for charged pions , kaons , protons and @xmath33-mesons . at high @xmath1",
    "the @xmath32 for @xmath34 seems to follow the same trend of the proton , whereas the @xmath32 for @xmath19 appears not to be suppressed . at intermediate @xmath1",
    "a mass - ordering is clearly observed among the baryons and mesons , respectively .",
    "the results of several studies on strangeness production are presented to investigate the properties of the strongly interacting matter created at the lhc in pb - pb collisions at @xmath6 tev . at intermediate @xmath1 @xmath2 production",
    "relative to @xmath35 is strongly enhanced in central pb - pb collisions . at high @xmath1",
    "however , @xmath8 appears to be similar to pp results , indicating that vacuum - like fragmentation dominates there .",
    "the enhancements of multi - strange baryons relative to pp increase both with the centrality and with the strangeness content of the baryon , but decrease with increasing energy , confirming the trend observed at lower energies .",
    "the comparison of the nuclear modification factors for multi - strange baryons to lighter particles shows that , while the @xmath32 for @xmath34 at high @xmath1 seems to follow the same trend as of the proton , the behavior of @xmath19 is very different from the others .",
