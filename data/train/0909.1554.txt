    "the absence of massive ( @xmath4m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) cooling flows in the cores of x - ray luminous galaxy clusters is often used as prime evidence that feedback plays an important role in regulating star formation and galaxy formation in dense environments ( see , e.g. , review by veilleux , cecil , & bland - hawthorn 2005 ) .",

    "2005 and rodriguez - martinez et  al .",
    "2006 ) : ( a ) a cooling wake , produced by a cooling flow occurring around the moving cd galaxy ( as in ngc  5044 ; david et  al .  1994 ) , ( b ) a `` condensation trail '' produced by the ram pressure of the radio source passing through the multiphase medium of the icm and ism of the host galaxy , ( c ) evaporation of cold gas ram - pressure stripped from the cd galaxy , and ( d ) an accretion wake produced by the gravitational focussing effects of the moving cd galaxy on the icm ( e.g. sakelliou et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "scenario ( d ) requires that the accreting icm be gravitationally focused by the cd galaxy and cool into a wake .",
    "however , the relatively large sound speed of the hot gas makes it unlikely that this process alone can account for the presence of the long , thin , x - ray filament . in scenario ( c ) , the material making up the filaments is ism stripped from the cd galaxy .",
    "the large mass of hot gas in the filaments , @xmath34 m@xmath35 ( fabian et  al .",
    "2001 ) , and thin geometry of the filaments are hard to explain in this scenario .",
    "however , this does not exclude the possibility that _ some _ of the gas outside the cd galaxy is produced in this way ( e.g.  the broad base of the h@xmath0 filaments ) .",
    "scenario ( b ) also presents some problems . as argued by fabian et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , it seems unlikely that the cd galaxy plunging through the icm would result in cooling , rather than heating , of the multiphase medium .",
    "moreover we see no obvious connection in the data between the radio jets of 4c  6.42 and the long filaments .    by process of elimination , these arguments seem to favor scenario ( a ) .",
    "the very thin geometry of the h@xmath0 filaments points to highly non - linear runaway cooling in this region . potentially contributing heating / ionization sources in the filaments include ( i ) the central agn , ( ii ) hot young stellar population outside the cd galaxy , ( iii ) x - rays from the icm itself , ( iv ) heat conduction from the icm to the colder filaments , ( v ) shocks and turbulent mixing layers , and ( vi ) collisional heating by cosmic rays . arguments based on the agn energetics and",
    "the line ratios in and out of the central region suggest that the agn is not strongly influencing the ionization of the material much beyond the central region ( @xmath36 6 kpc ) .",
    "the long , thin geometry of the filaments and their quiescent velocity field ( crawford et  al .",
    "2005 ) seem to rule out ionization by shocks and/or turbulent mixing layers , while the relative weakness of high - ionization lines suggests that ionization by the x - ray icm is also a small contributor",
    ". this leaves scenarios ( ii ) , ( iv ) , and ( vi ) as the most plausible explanations for the dominant heating mechanism in the filaments .",
    "the presence of fuv point sources in the filaments ( figure [ uvfil ] ) lends support to scenario ( ii ) , but is there enough star formation to account for the observed h@xmath0 emission ? to try to answer this question , we compare the fuv and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "figure [ sfr ] shows the average h@xmath0 and fuv surface brightnesses of the brighter features defined in figure [ multiband ] .",
    "the h@xmath0 and fuv luminosities of these features are listed in table 1 .",
    "assuming that the fuv and h@xmath0 star formation rate prescriptions of kennicutt ( 1998 ) derived from the global properties of star - forming galaxies also apply individually to these features ( we return to this assumption below ) , we find that the h@xmath0 and fuv surface brightnesses and luminosities of these features imply star formation rate surface densities and star formation rates which are generally consistent to within a factor of @xmath22 of each other .",
    "( the only exceptions are the arc and the ne and nw extensions , which are underluminous in h@xmath0 ; this could be due to a lack of gas in these regions or other forms of continuum emission process .",

    "these numbers are lower than previous measurements of the total , integrated star formation rate of @xmath2 5 - 20 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 ( smith et  al .  1997 ;",
    "mittaz et  al .",
    "2001 ) and the estimate of @xmath37 1 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 of star formation in the filament ( crawford et  al .",

    "chandra- _ and _ xmm_-derived integrated mass deposition rates from the inner icm ( ettori et al .",
    "2002 ; peterson et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the integrated h@xmath0 and fuv quantities discussed so far do not tell the full story : large spatial variations of the fuv / h@xmath0 ratio are seen on smaller scale ( see lower middle panel of figure [ multiband ] and pixel - to - pixel surface brightness measurements of figure [ sfr ] ) .",
    "these spatial variations may be due to a number of effects , including differential dust extinction , variations in star formation history ( sfh : age of burst , decay time scale ) or initial mass function ( imf ) , complex geometry of the gas relative to the ionizing stars , and contributions from non - stellar processes to the fuv and h@xmath0 emission .",
    "extinction corrections would boost the fuv fluxes relative to h@xmath0 and therefore could account for regions with anomalously small fuv / h@xmath0 ratios .",
    "published data on the filaments suggest relatively modest extinctions , however ( e.g.crawford et  al .",
    "variations in the sfh or imf change the relative importance of ionizing and non - ionizing stars and may account for variations in both directions of the fuv / h@xmath0 flux ratio .",
    "our data do not provide strong constraints on these parameters .",
    "geometrical effects are undoubtedly important in some regions , particularly in blobs # 1 and # 2 , where spatial offsets of @xmath212 kpc are visible between the h@xmath0 and fuv emission centroids . in these blobs , the kennicutt ( 1998 ) prescriptions may severely underestimate the number of fuv - bright stars needed to account for the h@xmath0 emission ; processes other than photoionization by hot stars appear needed to account for the observed h@xmath0 at these locations ( the recombination time scale is at least an order of magnitude shorter than the dynamical time scale to move @xmath212 kpc , unless the density of the h@xmath0 filaments is much less than @xmath21 @xmath38 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , additional heating sources also appear needed to explain the unusually strong low - ionization lines detected in the blobs and in between them ( e.g. hu et  al .",
    "1985 ; crawford et  al .  2005 ; figure [ multiband ] ) .",
    "two heating processes remain viable : ( iv ) heat conduction from the icm to the colder filaments and ( vi ) collisional heating by cosmic rays .",
    "the relative importance of these processes critically depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the filaments .",
    "strong magnetic fields could shield the cooling icm gas from re - heating by conduction with the hot icm ( scenario ( iv ) ) , creating long tubes of cool , dense gas .",
    "runaway star formation would take place along these magnetic field lines , where the gas is cooling and condensing to high enough density to become jeans unstable .",

    "the energetic particles contributing to the heating of the filaments in this scenario may either be produced in - situ by mhd processes or conducted in from the surrounding intracluster medium .",
    "given our previous discussion , we speculate that the optical emission in the se filaments of abell  1795 may naturally be explained by these heating processes . the magnetic field in the filaments may represent residual magnetic field originally associated with the radio galaxy but now entrained in the icm flow .",
    "if this is the case , the crisscrossing geometry of the se filaments may reflect precession of the radio jets or the orbital motion of the cd galaxy in the cluster potential .",
    "finally , we end with a cautionary note : our data do not provide quantitative constraints on the strength of the purported icm magnetic field .",
    "the possibility of runaway star formation unaided by magnetic field can not be ruled out .",
