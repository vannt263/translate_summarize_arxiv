    "the gravitational collapse to a black hole is a subject of intensive studies in general relativity .",
    "one of the main goals of these studies is to prove the cosmic censorship conjecture which says that a physically realistic generic gravitational collapse can not result in a naked singularity",
    ". it would be most interesting to assert that this conjecture is true in vacuum , however with current analytical techniques the problem seems tractable only in spherical symmetry and in this case there is no vacuum collapse because of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "thus , in order to generate spherically symmetric dynamics one has to couple matter fields .",
    "a simple choice , which led to important insights , is a real massless scalar field . for",
    "this matter model christodoulou showed that for small initial data the fields disperse to infinity @xcite , while for large data black holes are formed @xcite .",
    "the transition between these two scenarios was explored numerically by choptuik @xcite leading to the discovery of critical phenomena at the threshold of black hole formation .",
    "similar phenomena were later observed in many other matter models in spherical symmetry ( see @xcite for a comprehensive review ) but , because of numerical difficulties , only once in vacuum for axially symmetric gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show that - at the price of going to @xmath0 dimensions - one can evade birkhoff s theorem and have gravitational collapse of pure gravitational waves in radial symmetry .",
    "the idea is very simple and is based on the fact that the geometry of the three - sphere @xmath2 has the property that one can break the isotropy but still have a homogeneous space .",
    "this happens as follows .",
    "the group of rotations acting on @xmath2 in euclidean space has a subgroup @xmath3 acting simply transitively on the three - sphere .",
    "this subgroup is isomorphic to the universal covering group of the connected component of the rotation group in three dimensions .",
    "the action of @xmath3 is generated by the simultaneous rotations in the ( @xmath4)planes , the ( @xmath5)planes and ( @xmath6)planes ( this action on @xmath2 defines also the bianchi ix homogeneous cosmological model in the @xmath7 dimensional general relativity ) .",
    "thus , in @xmath0 dimensions it is consistent to consider spacetimes with the metric of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are three one - forms invariant under @xmath3 satisfying the commutation relations @xmath10 . in terms of euler angles ( @xmath11 ) @xmath12 the metric functions @xmath13 are the three principal curvature radii of the squashed three - sphere .",
    "the case when all three @xmath14 are equal corresponds to the standard spherically symmetric ansatz for which the birkhoff theorem applies and the only solutions are minkowski and schwarzschild .",
    "however , if @xmath14 are different we will obtain nontrivial vacuum solutions with gravitational radiation . in this letter we restrict ourselves to a special case of the ansatz ( [ as ] ) in which @xmath15 . using the coordinate freedom in the two - space orthogonal to the group orbit of @xmath3 , we choose the volume radial coordinate @xmath16 , and write the metric as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are functions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that for this ansatz the three - sphere has a residual isotropy of the twisted product @xmath23 ( as in the taub universe ) .    substituting the ansatz ( [ metric ] ) into the vacuum einstein equations we get the equations of motion for the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in",
    "the following we use overdots and primes to denote @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the hamiltonian and momentum constraints are @xmath28 the evolution equation for @xmath20 has a form of the quasilinear wave equation @xmath29 in addition , we have a slicing condition for @xmath19 @xmath30 it is clear from the above equations that the only dynamical degree of freedom is the field @xmath20 which plays a role similar to the spherically symmetric scalar field in @xmath7 dimensions . if @xmath31 , it is easy to verify ( birkhoff s theorem ) that the only solution is schwarzschild @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( or minkowski if @xmath34 ) . as we shall see below these two static solutions",
    "play the role of attractors .",
    "note that equations ( 4 - 7 ) are scale invariant which excludes existence of regular asymptotically flat static solutions .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the mass function @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian constraint ( 4 ) takes a simple form @xmath37 note that the right hand side of equation ( [ mass ] ) is manifestly positive so @xmath35 is monotone increasing with @xmath22 . for asymptotically flat spacetimes",
    "@xmath38 exists and is constant in time .",
    "the total mass is given by @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the initial value problem for the above equations . to ensure regularity at the center we impose the boundary conditions @xmath40 we normalize time by the condition @xmath41 , which means that @xmath21 is the proper time at the center .",
    "we have solved the above equations using the free evolution scheme in which @xmath42 is updated using the momentum constraint ( 5 ) . the hamiltonian constraint ( 4 )",
    "was only monitored to check the accuracy of the code . the wave equation ( 6 )",
    "was rewritten as the pair of two first order equations for @xmath20 and an auxiliary variable @xmath43 .",
    "integration in time was done by a modified predictor - corrector mccormack method on a uniform spatial grid . the ordinary differential equation ( [ rr ] )",
    "was solved with the fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "the whole procedure has accuracy of second order in time and fourth order in space .",
    "the numerical results presented below were produced for initial data of the form of an ingoing generalized gaussian @xmath44 where the parameter @xmath45 was varied and the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 were fixed . to check universality of the critical behavior",
    ", we have verified that the results are independent of the specific choice of initial data .",
    "for all families of initial data the same picture , similar to the massless scalar field collapse , emerges . for small values of the control parameter @xmath45 the fields disperse leaving behind the flat spacetime . for large initial data",
    "a schwarzschild black hole is formed , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the process of settling down to the schwarzschild black hole can be described in more detail using the linear perturbation theory .",
    "linearizing equations ( 4 - 7 ) around the schwarzschild solution we obtain the linear wave equation for the perturbation @xmath48 @xmath49 where we have used the scaling freedom to set the radius of the horizon @xmath50 . introducing the tortoise",
    "coordinate @xmath51 and substituting @xmath52 into ( [ pert ] ) we get the schrdinger equation on the real line @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 quasinormal modes ( i.e. solutions of equation ( [ schr ] ) satisfying the outgoing wave conditions @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) for potentials of this type have been computed in @xcite via the method of continued fractions .",
    "the potential ( [ pot ] ) corresponds to the gravitational tensor perturbation with @xmath58 and in this case the least damped mode ( see table iii in @xcite ) has eigenvalue @xmath59 ( in units @xmath60 ) .",
    "this mode is expected to dominate the intermediate asymptotics of local convergence to schwarzschild . in fig .",
    "3 we show evidence confirming this expectation .",
    "we turn now to the description of critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation . in by now",
    "routine procedure for bistable systems , using bisection we have determined a critical parameter value @xmath61 which separates black hole formation from dispersion .",
    "the behavior of near - critical solutions clearly indicates the existence of a discretely self - similar critical solution with the echoing period @xmath62 .",
    "the profile of a near - critical solution and evidence for discrete self - similarity are shown in figs . 4 and 5 .",
    "as expected , the mass of the black hole @xmath63 changes continuously with @xmath45 and tends to zero for @xmath64 according to the power law @xmath65 where the scaling exponent @xmath66 is universal ( i.e. independent of initial data ) .",
    "this is shown in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "note that , in four space dimensions , mass has the dimension of @xmath67 , hence @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is an eigenvalue of the growing mode of the critical solution .",
    "-0.5 cm        summarizing , we have studied gravitational collapse of pure gravitational waves in @xmath0 dimensions and have found strong evidence for the type ii discretely self - similar critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation . as far as we know , besides the notable paper @xcite , this is the only example of critical behavior without matter .    to conclude ,",
    "let us mention some natural extensions of the study presented here .",
    "one interesting possibility is to investigate the general ansatz ( [ as ] ) with two dynamical degrees of freedom - the studies in this direction are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "it is also natural to look for similar models in higher dimensions .",
    "if one insists that the subgroup of the orthogonal group acts simply transitively , the only possibility is the one discussed in our paper . however ,",
    "if one allows multiply transitive subgroups of the orthogonal groups , the results given in besse @xcite show that there are models similar to the one considered here on any odd - dimensional sphere .",
