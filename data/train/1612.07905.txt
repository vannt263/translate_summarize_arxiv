    "propel by marangoni flow  @xcite when a surface tension gradient is either maintained by chemical reactions  @xcite , micellar solubilization  @xcite , or liquid  liquid phase separations  @xcite .",
    "however , the realization of self  propelled janus droplets has been proven difficult  @xcite and swimming droplets could so far not perform tasks comparable to solid self  propelling particles .    in this article , we report time  evolutive self  propelled ethanol / water droplets in a surrounding squalane / monoolein solution , which are able to deliver cargo .",
    "the evolution of the emulsion droplets is caused by a continuous release of ethanol from the droplet into the continuous phase and simultaneous uptake of monoolein from the continuous phase into the droplet phase .",
    "this leads , after a certain time , to a spontaneous phase separation between water and ethanol in the presence of the surfactant monoolein , see fig .",

    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the droplets can extract and precipitate dna during the phase separation process , which can is delivered via the ethanol  rich droplet to a target location . because the emergence of phase separation is controlled by the initial chemical composition of the droplets , several different cargo delivery processes can be achieved in a programmable manner .",
    "the propulsion mechanism is universal and could be realized with several other liquid mixtures or lipidic surfactant , including a wide range of alcoholic beverages ( if having sufficiently high alcohol content ) .",
    "the generation of evolutive self  propelling droplets is achieved using a four component system consisting of water , a water  miscible solvent , which is less polar than water and partially soluble in the surrounding phase , an oily phase , and an oil soluble surfactant .",
    "the surfactant needs a chemical affinity for the solvent and the oil should be immiscible with water .",
    "a combination of chemical substances satisfying all these conditions is water / ethanol / monoolein and squalane ( as 4% of ethanol is soluble in squalane ) . for simplicity we will restrict our following description to this particular system , but the reported concept is universal and similar results",
    "could be obtained for seven other chemical compositions fulfilling the above mentioned requirements , see  @xcite .",
    "droplets with a diameter of about 200  @xmath0 m were generated by injecting an ethanol / water mixture through a glass capillary ( inner diameter @xmath1 m ) into a flat observation chamber that is pre  filled with a continuous squalane / monoolein mixture .",
    "the bottom of the observation chamber is rendered hydrophobic with a self  assembled monolayer of octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ots ) to prevent adhesion and subsequent spreading of the droplets at the bottom surface of the chamber .",
    "depending on ethanol concentration , the generated water / ethanol droplets evolve with time assuming up to three different stages , as displayed fig .",
    "[ fig : exp1 ] .",
    "we start our description for a medium ethanol concentration , where all three stages can be observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exp1]a ) , and subsequently extend our discussion to smaller and respectively to larger initial ethanol concentrations . in the following discussion the monoolein concentration in squalane",
    "is always fixed to 15  mm , i.e. 7 times above the critical micellar composition ( cmc ) , if not explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "for intermediate ethanol concentrations , between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the droplets start to self ",
    "propel in the oil phase just after their production . during self  propulsion",
    "every droplet looses a few percent of its volume , and takes up monoolein molecules from the surrounding phase .",
    "the influx of monoolein to the swimming droplet is monitored by adding fluorescent lipids to the initial water / ethanol mixture .",
    "similar to monoolein , the fluorescent lipids display a strong affinity to ethanol and follows the repartition of monoolein molecules between the fluid phases , cf .",

    "a self  propelling droplet in _ stage  1 _ collects a large amount of monoolein from the oil phase as can be seen from the fluorescence activity after a short propulsion time . in case of large ethanol concentration ( @xmath16 ) , additional dark clouds can be observed around the droplet , which we suspect to be marangoni rolls  @xcite , together with a dark trail ( fig .",

    "obviously , the released material is ethanol which is soluble by @xmath18 in the surrounding squalane . because we neither observed self  propelling nor volume loss in the case of pure water droplets within the duration of the experiment irrespectively of the monoolein concentration , we further conclude that the fraction of water leaving the droplets can be neglected with respect to the ethanol loss",
    "the absence of self  propelled motion of pure water droplets agrees with the findings of thutupalli et al .",
    "@xcite but is at variance with the observations of izri et al .",
    "@xcite .    based on the above findings we conclude that the solubilization of ethanol into the squalane solution is driving the droplet motion .",

    "crystal droplets  @xcite , where liquid  crystal molecules are solubilized in a monoolein / squalane solution by filling surfactant micelles  @xcite , leading to a variation of the surface tension at the droplet surface and so to a marangoni flow  @xcite .",
    "however our situation is more complex than in refs .  @xcite as ethanol can be solubilized not only in micelles , but also at the molecular lever .",

    "the small droplets eventually grow in size , reaching @xmath23 m , when reaching the trailing ethanol droplet  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of the secondary droplet surface indicate the future macroscopic direction of motion of a janus drop : each small droplet nucleated at the interface of the water  rich droplet is a local sink for monoolein molecules in its near surrounding and is thus influencing the symmetry of the marangoni flow pattern around the janus droplet . if the distribution of the small ethanol  rich droplets is homogeneous , the flow is symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis of the janus droplet leading to a relatively straight trajectory .",
    "in contrast , an inhomogeneous distribution of the secondary nucleated droplets induces an asymmetric flow field and triggers a rotation of the water ",
    "rich droplet away from the small droplets  @xcite .",
    "based on the above findings , we already concluded that the droplets in _",
    "stage  1 _ are driven by the solubilization of ethanol into the surrounding oil phase . in view of the accumulation of monoolein inside the trailing droplet in _",
    "stage  3 _ and the continuing formation of a monoolein depleted layer in the squalane around the leading droplet , it suggests itself to model the propulsion in _",
    "stage  2 _ and _ 3 _ from a balance between the work dissipated in viscous flows and the chemical energy released by monoolein molecules on their path from the ambient squalane phase into the trailing droplet .",
    "this release of chemical energy drives a marangoni flow that continuously propels the janus droplet .",
    "since the small solvent molecules ethanol and water diffuse much faster than the large monoolein molecules , we assume a chemical equilibrium of water and ethanol between the two bulk phases . under these assumptions",
    "the concentration of solvents to the bulk phases follows the binodal line of the phase diagram , while the relative partition of ethanol and water to the leading and trailing droplet is solely controlled by the total amount of monoolein in the janus droplets .",
    "the flux of monoolein molecules into the trailing droplet in stage _ 3 _ can be expressed by the droplet velocity and the surface coverage of monoolein on the interface of the leading droplet .",
    "close the final chemical equilibrium of the janus droplet with the squalane phase , it is justified to approximate the surface coverage @xmath24 by the its corresponding equilibrium value . by virtue of the gibbs adsorption isotherm",
    ", we can relate the gradient of the interfacial free energy to the gradient of the chemical potential of monoolein molecules .",
    "the thin depletion layer of monoolein in the squalane solution around the janus droplet with thickness @xmath25 indicates large peclet numbers @xmath26 , and we can set the chemical potential of the adsorbed monoolein molecules at the tip of the leading droplet to the value @xmath27 in the squalane solution .",
    "the chemical potential at the three phase contact line can be related to the concentration @xmath28 of monoolein molecules in the trailing droplet .",
    "but as more and more monoolein accumulate in the trailing droplet , the difference of chemical potentials of the monoolein molecules in the squalane phase , @xmath27 and in the ethanol  rich trailing droplet , @xmath22 , decreases , and the janus droplets slow down . in return , this deceleration reduces the flux of monoolein molecules into the trailing droplet and we predict an exponential decrease of the droplet velocity @xmath29 to zero in stage _ 3_. the time constant of this exponential decrease can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dynamic viscosity of the squalane phase , @xmath32 the volume of the trailing droplet and @xmath33 a factor of order unity that contains the dependence on the geometry of the janus droplet and the viscosity ratios of the bulk fluids @xcite .",
    "spontaneous de  mixing of the mother droplet into an ethanol  rich and a water  rich phase marking the end of _ stage 1 _ starts once the composition of the janus droplet reaches the boundary of the miscibility gap .",
    "provided a low initial ethanol concentration of the mother droplet at the beginning of _ stage 1 _ we observe the nucleation of small ethanol ",
    "rich minority phase droplets that quickly coarsen . with a certain delay after the onset of nucleation , the first minority phase droplets attach to the interface between the squalane and the water",

    "rich majority phase and the squalane phase start to solubilize into the bulk of the ethanol ",
    "rich trailing droplet .",
    "as outlined above for the droplet propulsion in _ stage 3 _ the resulting gradient in the chemical potential of monoolein molecules causes a marangoni flow .",
    "since the trailing droplet is initially very small , it is quickly saturated with monoolein unless larger , ` fresh ' minority phase droplets coalesce with the trailing droplet and dilute the monoolein .",
    "the increase of concentration caused by the influx of monoolein molecules from the interface of the leading droplet is quickly surpassed by the dilution with minority phase droplets that coalesce with the trailing droplet . as a result , the difference of the chemical potential between the monoolein molecules in the ambient squalane and the ethanol  rich trailing droplet increases in _ stage 2 _ , and thus the propulsion velocity .    to estimate the balance of monooleine accumulation and its dilution in _ stage 2 _",
    ", we employ the average radius of the minority phase droplets measured in our experiments .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the experimental data shows that both the radius of the minority phase droplets in the bulk of the mother droplet and the radius of the trailing droplet in _ stage 2 _ conforms to a power law @xmath34 in time @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a linear growth of the typical domain size after a quench into the miscibility gap of a binary liquid was already predicted from dimensional analysis of the transport equations @xcite and observed in experiments @xcite .    setting the growth exponent of the radius to @xmath36 ,",
    "dimensionalized undersaturation of monoolein in the trailing droplet in _ stage 2 _ , and the propuslion velocity @xmath37 are described by the equation @xmath38 solutions @xmath39 of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : early_time ] ) and , hence , the velocity @xmath29 , displays a nearly linear rise in _ stage 2 _ , in agreement with experimental findings @xcite .    since the final volume of the trailing droplet scales as @xmath40 , eqn .",

    "@xmath44 we find a constant peak velocity as in the experiments @xcite .",
    "the model introduced above is based on the assumption that the water and ethanol molecules of two fluid phases of the janus droplet are chemically equilibrated at any instance in time .",
    "however , we know from experimental observations that this assumption can not be completely fulfilled . in _ stage 3 _ , in particular , we observe the nucleation and growth of small ethanol ",
    "rich droplets at the interface between the water ",
    "rich droplet with the squalane phase .",
    "these droplets are advected to and merge with the trailing droplet .",
    "a secondary nucleation indicates that the de  mixing of ethanol and water is still ongoing in _ stage 3_. droplets of the minority phase created in this secondary nucleation could be responsible for an increased influx of monoolein molecules into the trailing droplet that allows larger droplets to reach a chemical equilibrium on the same time scale as droplets with a smaller radius .",
    "the discrepancy between the perdictions of the model and the experimental results could also arise from an unjustified assumption of chemcial equilibration of water and ethanol in the janus droplet .",
    "it is well possible that ethanol and water molecules in two bulk phases of the janus droplet are not close to a chemcial equilibrium , and the gradients in the composition of the solvents also contribute to the propelling marangoni stresses .",
    "moreover , the quick uptake of monoolein in _ stage 1 _ , and the synchroneous appearance of monodisperse minority phase droplets suggests a spinodal decomposition of an unstable phase at the beginning of _ stage 2 _ rather than a homogeneous nucleation . in view of the complexity of the many competing kinetic effects",
    ", it does not come as a surprise that the maximum velocity and the scaling of the exponential decay time recorded in experiments do not conform to the prediction of our simple simple model .      in this section",

    "rich leading droplet and an ethanol  rich trailing droplet .",
    "in contrast to similar bulk methods  @xcite , dna extraction in self - propelling and phase separating droplets occurs in a single step during less than @xmath47  minutes with sample volumes on the picoliter scale , cf .",
    "[ fig : exp4]a , c .    to achieve a controlled cargo delivery , we use the fact that the ethanol  rich droplet , which is formed during the evolutive self  propulsion spreads easily on a polydimethylsyloxane ( pdms ) surface upon contact . using this strategy ,",
