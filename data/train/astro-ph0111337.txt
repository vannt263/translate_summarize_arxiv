    "in 1980 , _ hakucho _ detected a bursting x - ray source in the direction of the globular cluster terzan 1 ( makishima et al .",
    "1981 ; inoue et al . 1981 ) .",
    "several years later , a steady x - ray source was detected ( x 1732304 ) consistent with this globular cluster and it is most likely the same source as the bursting source ( skinner et al .",
    "1987 ; parmar , stella , & giommi 1989 ) .",
    "since then , the source has persistently been detected at 210 kev luminosities between a few times @xmath4 erg s@xmath2 and @xmath5 erg s@xmath2 ( see figure 3 of guainazzi , parmar , & oosterbroek 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the source was detected with the _ rosat _ high resolution imager , which constrained the position of the source to @xmath05@xmath6 ( johnston , verbunt , & hasinger 1995 ) .",
    "also , a radio source was detected with the _ vla _ in the _ rosat _ error circles ( mart ' i   et al .",
    "1998 ) and it might be the radio counterpart of x 1732304 .",
    "guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) reported on an anomalous low - state from x 1732304 during a 1999 _ bepposax _ observation .",
    "they could only detect one dim source with a 210 kev luminosity of @xmath7 erg s@xmath2 ( for a distance of 5.2 kpc [ ortolani et al .",
    "1999 ] ; note that guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 used 4.5 kpc ) .",
    "this source luminosity and its x - ray spectrum are both very similar to those observed for the neutron star transients in the galaxy when they are in their quiescent state .",
    "these similarities strongly indicate that x 1732304 suddenly turned off and became quiescent after having accreted for more than 12 years .",
    "this conclusion also holds when this _ bepposax _ source is not x 1732304 but an unrelated source , likely also part of the globular cluster ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1999 ) . the long active episode of x 1732304 makes it very similar to the neutron star x - ray transient ks 1731260 , which was also active for more than a decade ( see wijnands et al .",
    "2001 , who called such systems long - duration x - ray transients ) .",
    "recently , it was realized ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ) that when such long - duration x - ray transients turn off again , that they could be used to study the effects of a prolonged period of accretion on the neutron star core and crust , and on the the quiescent properties of neutron star x - ray transients . at the end of 2000 or early 2001 , ks 1731260 suddenly turned off after an accretion episode which lasted for at least 12 years .",
    "observation on this source performed in march 2001 ( just a few months after this source turned off ) showed that the quiescent luminosity and temperature of this source were very similar to those of the ordinary transients in quiescence ( wijnands et al .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "observation of ks 1731260 , which was performed a few weeks before the _ chandra _ one , showed very similar source properties ( burderi et al .",
    "2002 ) . if the quiescent emission in neutron star transients is due to thermal emission from the neutron star ( e.g , van paradijs et al .",
    "1987 ) , then the exact quiescent luminosity should depend on the time - averaged accretion rate of the system ( e.g. , campana et al .",
    "1998 ; brown , bildsten , & rutledge 1998 ) .",
    "if true , then ks 1731260 has to be in quiescence in between outbursts for over a thousand years in order for the neutron star to be as cool as measured ( wijnands et al .",
    "2001 ; rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "it is unclear if ks 1731260 is unique in its behavior or that more sources behave similarly .",
    "several more long - duration transients are known and among them , x 1732304 is one of the best candidates to study in quiescence and to compare with ks 1731260 , because it is currently quiescent . here",
    "we report our analysis of a short _ chandra _ observation on this source during quiescence .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation used in this paper was performed on 9 march 2000 for a total of 3665 seconds of on source time and using the hrc - i instrument .",

    "if the presence of those sources can be confirmed , then their positions are consistent ( within the _ chandra _ pointing errors ) with the _ rosat _ and _ vla _ positions of x 1732304 .",
    "however , for now , we assume that we did not detect x 1732304 and that less than 5 counts have been observed from it , resulting in a count rate upper limit of @xmath21 counts s@xmath2 . by assuming that the quiescent spectrum of this source is very similar to that of the other quiescent neutron star transient",

    "using our new _",
    "result on x 1732304 , we can look back at the _ bepposax _ observation of terzan 1 in order to investigate whether the _ bepposax _ source is x 1732304 or an unrelated source . we converted ( using pimms ) the _ bepposax _ lecs and mecs count rates listed by guainazzi et al . ( 1999 ) into predicted _ chandra_/hrc - i count rates using a column density of @xmath22 @xmath15 and the power - law shaped spectrum observed ( with photon index of 2.2@xmath240.6 ; guainazzi et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the predicted hrc - i count rate is in the range 3 to 9 @xmath25 counts s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the count rates observed for the 10 count source combined with the count rate upper limit on x 1732304 .",
    "therefore , no strong evidence is available for variability between the _ bepposax _ and _ chandra _ observations .",
    "however , x 1732304 is currently not the brightest x - ray source in the cluster indicating that most if not all of the flux detected by _",
    "bepposax _ might not have come from this source but from the 10 count source we discovered .",
    "the current quiescent state of x 1732304 allows for the possible radio identification to be verified and a search for the optical counterpart of the source .",
    "the radio and optical observations reported by mart ' i   et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and ortolani et al . ( 1999 ) were performed during times when x 1732304 was still actively accreting .",
    "the current lack of significant accretion in this system will most likely also considerably have reduced its radio and optical emission .",
    "we presented a short _ chandra_/hrc - i observation of the globular cluster terzan 1 , known to contain the bright neutron star low - mass x - ray binary x 1732304 .",
    "although we detect one source with a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath18 erg s@xmath2 , we could not detect x 1732304 conclusively , with a luminosity upper limit of 0.5  1 @xmath26 erg s@xmath2  ( 0.510 kev ; for a black - body shaped spectrum with @xmath16 is 0.20.3 kev ) .",
    "brown et al . ( 1998 ) argued that the quiescent emission of neutron star systems is due to thermal emission from the neutron star surface and that the x - ray spectrum should be fitted with a neutron star atmosphere model and not a black body .",
    "rutledge et al . ( 1999 ) showed that indeed such models can fit the quiescent data , and that the bolometric luminosity obtained is about twice the 0.510 kev luminosity .",
    "therefore , we assume a bolometric flux upper limit of @xmath17 erg @xmath15 s@xmath2  ( @xmath27 erg s@xmath2 ) for x 1732304 .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 1998 ) further argued that if the quiescent luminosity should depend on the time - averaged accretion rate of the source then a distance independent relation can be derived between the time - averaged flux @xmath28 and the quiescent flux @xmath29 of @xmath30 ( see , e.g. , rutledge et al .",
    "2002 ; but neglecting neutrino emission from the core ) .",
    "the latter can be rewritten as @xmath31 resulting in @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the average flux during outburst , @xmath34 the average time the source is in outburst , and @xmath35 the average time the source is in quiescence ( see also wijnands et al .",
    "we can estimate @xmath36 via figure 3 of guainazzi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , from which it can be deduced that the average 210 kev outburst luminosity is around 10@xmath37 erg s@xmath2 . due to the relatively high column density towards terzan 1",
    ", the average bolometric luminosity can easily be a factor 5 or more higher ( pimms indeed gives a factor @xmath05 difference between the 210 kev absorbed flux and the bolometric unabsorbed flux , using the column density towards terzan 1 and a power - law spectrum with photon index of 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume a bolometric luminosity of @xmath38 erg s@xmath2 , resulting in a bolometric flux @xmath39 of @xmath40 erg @xmath15 s@xmath2 . by using @xmath41 of @xmath42 erg @xmath15 s@xmath2   and a @xmath43 of 12 years , then the @xmath44 is @xmath45180 years .",
    "we stress that this derived lower limit is subject to large errors because of the uncertainties in the numbers used .",
    "for example , we have assumed an outburst duration of 12 years for the last outburst .",
    "however , this should be considered a lower limit because although persistent emission from x 1732304 was only first detected in the mid 1980 s ( e.g. skinner et al .",
    "1987 ; parmar et al . 1989 ) , the source was already detected through x - ray bursts in 1980 with _",
    "( makishima et al . 1981 ; inoue et al . 1981 )",
    "indicating that the source was already actively accreting during that period . when assuming that @xmath43 is more like 17 years then @xmath44 would be @xmath46 years .",
    "we have also assumed that the averaged flux during outburst and the duration of the outburst are very similar between distinct outbursts . for x",
    "1732304 we can not test those assumptions because so far only one outburst has been observed from this source . from other recurrent transients it is clear that arguments in favor and against those assumptions can be made , so for simplicity , we assume that it is true for x 1732304 .",
    "further ( i.e. , longer ) _ chandra _ observations are also needed to determine the exact quiescent luminosity of x 1732304 ( including its quiescent spectrum ) to constrain further the time the source is inferred to be quiescent .",
    "assuming that all the above mentioned assumptions are valid , then x 1732304 would be the second system after ks 1731260 ( wijnands et al . 2001 ) which has been identified as possibly having rather long quiescent episodes .",
    "remarkably , both systems have very long accretion episodes and long inferred quiescent episodes ( note that this might also be true for the long - duration transient 4u 2129 + 47 ; wijnands 2002 ; nowak , heinz , & begelman 2002 ) . in contrast , the ordinary transients which have been detected in quiescence have short outburst episodes and relatively short quiescent ones ( see , e.g. , chen , shrader , livio 1997 for the behavior of ordinary transients ) .",
    "this division in two groups is suggestive of the presence of a correlation between the duration of the active episode and that of the quiescent one .",
    "it is unclear if such a correlation can be explained in the current disk instability models ( e.g. , lasota 2001 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this apparent correlation might be that in the long - duration transients enhanced neutrino cooling occurs in the core of their neutron stars , and in the ordinary transients only standard cooling .",
    "colpi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that when the neutron star mass exceeds 1.65 m@xmath47 , that this enhanced cooling occurs in the core .",
    "if both types of transient systems have similar quiescent episodes , the significantly higher time - averaged accretion rate in the long - duration systems compared to the ordinary ones , will increase the mass of the neutron stars in the long - duration transients faster than those in the normal ones . if one assumes that the systems are roughly of equal age , than the long - duration transients will have neutron stars with higher masses and thus are more likely to have enhanced neutrino emission in their neutron star cores .    alternatively",
    ", the quiescent emission might not originate from the neutron star surface , but might be due to some other process , such as residual accretion or models in which the neutron star magnetic field is highly involved ( e.g. , stella et al .",
    "1994 ; menou et al .",
    "1999 ; campana & stella 2000 ) .",
    "as already discussed by wijnands ( 2002 ) , in such models it is expected that , regardless of the outburst histories , the quiescent emission of the different systems should be very similar if their system parameters ( i.e. , orbital period ; spin , mass , and magnetic field strength of the neutron star ) are very similar .",
    "such assumptions are not unrealistic : from the burst oscillations during type - i x - ray bursts , we have a good handle on the spin frequency of the neutron star in several normal transients such as aql x-1 ( 549 hz ; zhang et al . 1998 ) and 4u 160852 ( 619 hz ; chakrabarty et al .",
    "2000 ) and in several long - duration transients ks 1731260 ( 524 hz ; smith , morgan , & bradt 1997 ) and mxb 1659298 ( 567 hz ; wijnands , strohmayer , & franco 2001 ) , which are all in a very narrow range .",
    "moreover , the orbital periods of aql x-1 ( 19 hrs ; welsh , robinson , & young 2000 ) and 4u 160852 ( 12.9 hrs ; wachter et al .",
    "2002 ) are not extremely different from that of mxb 1659298 ( 7.1 hrs ; cominsky & wood 1984 ) , which indicate similar mass transfer rates from the companion star ( see narayan , garcia , & mcclintock 2001 for a discussion ) .",
    "therefore , in those alternative models it is natural to expect that the quiescent properties are very similar among the different type of systems .",
    "the small differences in exact luminosity can easily be explained by invoking small difference in , e.g. , the amount of residual accretion or the actual strength of the magnetic field .",
