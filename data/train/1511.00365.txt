    "these results are attributable to the photo doping carriers and collapse of the carrier localization .",
    "similar photoinduced transitions from an insulating state to a metallic state have been widely confirmed experimentally in correlated insulating states  @xcite , such as la@xmath166cuo@xmath167 .",
    "this photoinduced metallic state is also demonstrated by the present calculations , although the carrier concentration is set to be @xmath70 which is different from that in sr@xmath165cu@xmath3o@xmath4 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opt1](a ) , just after the photon pulse pumping , a low energy spectral weight appears inside the insulating gap , which produces the metallic reflectivity spectra .",

    "@xcite    the time resolved optical experiments were also performed in the metallic ladder cuprates , sr@xmath1ca@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 with @xmath6 .  @xcite the pump photon energy was tuned at 1.58ev corresponding to the charge transfer excitation energy in the ladder plane .",
    "just after the photon pumping , the low energy optical reflectivity at 0.5ev shows a reduction , implying a suppression of an initial metallic character .",
    "the experimental reflectivity shows a slow increasing after around 0.5ps , which is interpreted to be thermalization through relaxations to the lattice degree of freedom .",
    "the present theoretical calculations provide a possible interpretation for this experimental observation of the photoinduced suppression of the metallic state .",
    "we confirm this photoinduced suppression through not only the calculations of the pump - probe spectra , but also the calculations of the low energy component of the kinetic energy , the one - particle excitation spectra and others . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aniso](b)-(f ) , we identify that the ladder lattice effect plays an essential roles on this suppression , in contrast to a photoinduced metallic state in the mott insulating state .",
    "the double pulse pumping reinforces a validity of the present scenario for the photoexcited state in metallic ladder cuprates .",
    "the time resolved spectroscopy under the double pulse pumping was performed experimentally in insulating sr@xmath165cu@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite the first pump pulse fluence was varied and the second pulse fluence was fixed , in the same way with the present theoretical calculation introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : double ] .",
    "increases of the reflectivity at 0.5ev were observed monotonically as function of the first pulse fluence . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in the reflectivity by the second pulse pumping qualitatively depends on the first pulse fluence ; the reflectivity within 0.5ps after the second pulse pumping increases ( decreases ) in the cases of the weak ( strong ) first pulse fluence .",
    "this tendency of the reflectivity change is well reproduced qualitatively by the present calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_opt ] . in the experiments , over 0.5ps after the second pulse pumping , the reflectivity starts to increase being independent of the second pulse fluence .",
    "this is attributable to the relaxation effects to the lattice degree of freedom which is not taken into account in the present theoretical calculations .    in conclusion ,",
    "we study photoinduced carrier dynamics in a correlated electron system on a two - leg ladder lattice .",
    "the ladder hubbard model is analyzed by utilizing the numerical exact diagonalization method in finite size clusters based on the lanczos algorithm . through the calculations of the transient low - energy kinetic energy , optical conductivity spectra , one - particle excitation spectra and others , we find that the initial metallic state is suppressed by the photon pulse pumping .",
    "this is in contrast to the photoinduced metallic state in the mott insulating state .",
    "the ladder lattice effect plays an essential role on this photoinduced suppression of the metallic character .",
