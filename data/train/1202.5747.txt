    "quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe ) is a quantum mechanical version of the hall effect in a ferromagnet in absence of an external magnetic field or landau levels .",
    "different from the quantum hall effect in a strong magnetic field , it originates from the topological properties of band structure in solid .",
    "usually the anomalous hall effect occurs in ferromagnetic metals due to the intrinsic spin - orbit coupling or extrinsic spin - orbit scattering.@xcite it has been realized that the hall conductance can be expressed as the summation of the berry curvature in momentum space over all occupied states of electrons .",
    "this makes it possible to realize the quantum hall effect even without the landau levels.@xcite a simple picture for qahe was proposed in a two - dimensional electron gas with strong spin - orbit coupling.@xcite electron localization in disordered systems also provides an alternative approach to realize this effect.@xcite the discovery of the quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) and topological insulators@xcite stimulated extensive interest to search qahe in realistic systems . as a result of time - reversal symmetry breaking in topological insulators ,",
    "this effect was predicted in a magnetically doped hg@xmath0mn@xmath1te",
    "quantum well@xcite and cr or fe doped topological insulators,@xcite in which the presence of magnetization suppresses one of helical edge states in qshe , and preserves a chiral edge state for the quantum hall effect .",
    "very recently hgcr@xmath2se@xmath3 is proposed to be a chern semimetal and exhibits qahe in quantum - well structure.@xcite interaction - driven topologically non - trivial mott insulating phase displaying qahe or qshe has also attracted much research interest.@xcite    while in search of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors , rigorous models of ferromagnetism@xcite or ferrimagnetism @xcite in strongly correlated electron systems provides an alternative context to realize ferromagnetism . a common feature of these examples is the flat or almost flat band of electrons . the coulomb interaction may remove high degeneracy of electrons in the band , leading to the ferromagnetism according to the stoner criteria .",
    "recently it was predicted that the ferromagnetism may occur in the hubbard model with topological non - trivial bands.@xcite    in this paper we propose a theory of qahe in a flat band ferromagnet with spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional decorated lattice model , which has a pair of flat bands in the middle of the energy spectrum .",
    "the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling makes the energy bands topologically non - trivial , and gives rise to qshe .",
    "based on the rigorous results for the hubbard model , the coulomb interaction may induce the ferrimagnetism in the ground state , when the middle flat bands are half filled .",
    "it provides an ideal way to realize a magnetic staggered field .",
    "the staggered field can modulate the topological numbers of electron bands by closing and reopening the energy gap.@xcite different configurations of topological invariants assigned to the electron bands can then be obtained and will give different topological phases . based on a self - consistent mean field calculation , we present the phase diagram of the ground state . we find that qahe with nonzero chern number can be realized in a ferromagnet due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "we begin with the tight - binding hamiltonian on a two - dimensional decorated lattice [ see fig .

    "[ fig01](a ) as the unit cell .",
    "since the @xmath22 component of spin @xmath23 commutes with this hamiltonian , the hamiltonian has a block - diagonalized form in momentum space after the fourier transformation , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 denotes different spins , and @xmath27 @xmath28 is the time - reversal partner of @xmath29 .",

    "the two middle bands are degenerate . in this case , if only one single middle band is fully filled , the expectation value of the coulomb interaction is minimized since the fully polarized electron spin in the middle band excludes the double occupancy completely at each site . in this way",
    ", the ground state of the system is ferromagnetic .",
    "the total spin is given by the degeneracy of the flat band , @xmath131.@xcite furthermore , since the antiferromagnetic correlation is dominant in the half - filled hubbard model , this ground state is actually ferrimagnetic in which ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long range orders coexist.@xcite when the spin - orbit coupling is present , the flat bands will be distorted by the ferrimagnetism .",
