    "the acceleration of particles through repeated interactions with the electromagnetic fields up- and down - stream of a collisionless shock front is generally taken as the source the non - thermal particle populations that are detected in powerful astrophysical outflows .",
    "the physics of this fermi mechanism is relatively well understood for non - relativistic shock velocities , at least in the test particle limit in which one neglects the backreaction of the accelerated particles on the shock environment . in the relativistic limit however , in which the shock moves toward the upstream ( unshocked ) medium with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath1 , the situation becomes more intricate , mostly because the shock now moves about as fast as the accelerated particle . in non - relativistic shocks",
    "one can distinguish the details of the shock structure from that of the fermi process , as this latter takes place on spatial scales much larger than the shock thickness .",
    "on the contrary , in relativistic shocks , the structure of the shock plays a significant role in the fermi process and in the process of generation of the electromagnetic turbulence .",
    "one important issue in particular , is the reflection of a part of the cold upstream particles at the shock front , which together with the fermi accelerated particles , travel back upstream and initiate instabilities in the upstream plasma .",
    "these instabilities play a key role in the development of the fermi process and consequently , in the radiative signatures of relativistic outflows .",
    "indeed , at magnetized oblique ultra - relativistic shock waves , the fermi process may develop only if sufficient micro - turbulence has been generated in order to prevent the advection of the accelerated particles away from the shock front into the far downstream plasma ( begelman & kirk 1990 , niemiec & ostrowski 2006 , lemoine et al .",
    "2006 ) . and , for the vast majority of them",
    ", ultra - relativistic shock waves are oblique : the opposite parallel configuration only takes effect when the magnetic field lines are oriented to an angle with the shock normal smaller than @xmath2 ( in the unshocked plasma or upstream rest frame ) . as to the meaning of `` magnetized '' shock waves ,",
    "it is slightly ambiguous and context dependent ; above , it is meant : with a pre - existing ( upstream ) magnetic field @xmath3 such that , after compression through the shock and lorentz transform into the downstream frame , the typical larmor radius of accelerated particles is much smaller than the width of the blast , which is of the order of @xmath4 in this frame ( @xmath5 denotes the shock radius ) . for smaller values of @xmath6 , the accelerated particles can explore the whole blast and beyond , hence they may scatter on magnetic inhomogeneities sourced elsewhere , which would allow their repeated interactions with the shock .",
    "nevertheless , for such low values of @xmath3 , the generation of micro - turbulence is guaranteed , as will be discussed in the following , hence the fermi process should develop independently of any extra source of magnetic inhomogeneities , with @xmath7 the larmor radius in the downstream frame shock compressed background magnetic field ( pelletier et al .",
    "while this is guaranteed for micro - instabilities when they can be triggered in the precursor , this constraint can be turned into a lower bound on the growth rate of extra sources of turbulence , which of course differs from the constraint on the growth of micro - instabilities discussed here and in lemoine & pelletier ( 2010 ) . ]",
    "furthermore , there exist evidence for amplification of the magnetic field upstream of a relativistic shock , see e.g. li & waxman ( 2006 ) , li & zhao ( 2011 ) , which can be seen as a hallmark of the development of micro - instabilities upstream of the shock .    on microscopic plasma scales , several instabilities may develop in the precursor of the shock front through the penetration of the beam of returning and accelerated particles into the upstream plasma . the filamentation instability in particular",
    " often referred to as the weibel instability in the literature  has been proposed as the agent of amplification of the magnetic field to the level inferred from the synchrotron interpretation of gamma - ray burst afterglows ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 , medvedev & loeb 1999 ; see also wiersma & achterberg 2004 , lyubarsky & eichler 2006 , achterberg & wiersma 2007 , achterberg et al .",
    "recently , it has been found that the growth rate of two - stream instabilities in an oblique configuration ( bret , firpo & deutsch 2005 ) is larger than that of the filamentation mode ( bret 2009 , lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "which instability grows faster is a key question here , as the relativistic velocity of the shock wave and the level of upstream magnetization strongly limit the penetration length scale of the accelerated particles into the upstream plasma before these particles are caught back by the shock wave ( milosavljevi & nakar 2006 , pelletier et al .",
    "2009 ) ; and as mentioned before , if such instabilities can not grow , then fermi acceleration can not develop ( at least , in the absence of extra sources of turbulence ) .",
    "the detailed conditions under which the above instabilities and other relevant modes can grow , together with the development of fermi cycles as a function of the shock velocity and the upstream magnetization have been discussed in a previous paper ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "that paper assumed a charge neutralized beam without angular dispersion propagating in a cold background plasma .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to revisit these assumptions and to extend the previous calculations to a more generic situation , in which the beam angular dispersion ( which is fixed by kinematics , as discussed below ) is taken into account , and in which the effects of heating of the upstream plasma are considered . the emergence of current instabilities is also discussed .",
    "the present study is warranted in particular by recent work ( lyubarsky & eichler 2006 , rabinak et al . 2011 ) that showed that the small opening angle of the beam suffices to prevent the onset of the filamentation instability in electron - proton plasmas of shock lorentz factor @xmath8 , independently of the length scale of the precursor .",
    "the present study recovers this result for a cold background plasma , but it also argues that : ( i ) the two - stream instability and more precisely its oblique mode version is less sensitive to the beam angular dispersion as it can develop down to @xmath0 in the same conditions ; ( ii ) the heating of the background plasma has a major effect in that it may help sustain the development of instabilities down to @xmath0 .    the present paper is laid out as follows . in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we first review the current understanding on the structure of the shock , relying on the results of the most recent particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of relativistic collisionless shocks .",
    "we also discuss in a general way the instabilities that may develop as a function of the two main characteristics of the shock : upstream magnetization and shock velocity . in section  [ sec : coldback ] , we then discuss how the filamentation and two - stream instabilities are affected by the finite angular dispersion of the beam of returning particles , assuming the background plasma to remain cold . in section  [ sec : hotback ] we generalize the calculations of sec .",
    "[ sec : coldback ] to a background plasma composed of cold protons and relativistically hot electrons . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : curr - inst ] we discuss the possibility of current instabilities and their role in shaping the precursor .",
    "we summarize our results and draw conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : beam - chi ] , we explicit the susceptibility tensor of the beam of finite angular dispersion , modeled with a waterbag distribution in the transverse momentum direction ( transverse with respect to the shock normal ) and a dirac distribution in the parallel momentum direction .",
    "let us first describe the general structure of a relativistic collisionless shock and introduce the main quantities of interest for the present discussion .",
    "the shock is characterized by a small number of parameters : ( i ) the composition ahead of the shock front , in the upstream plasma  in what follows , we assume except otherwise noted that the plasma is composed of electrons and protons with densities @xmath9 ; ( ii ) the equation of state of the upstream plasma , which will be taken cold or composed of relativistically hot electrons but cold protons ( see also further below for more details on this point ) ; ( iii ) the shock velocity , written as @xmath10 as measured in the upstream frame , with corresponding lorentz factor @xmath11 ; ( iv ) the magnetization of the upstream plasma , written @xmath12 and defined as @xmath13 the magnetic field strength @xmath3 is here measured in the upstream frame .",
    "the shock structure also depends on the obliquity of the background magnetic field , but in what follows and except otherwise noted , we will focus on the generic superluminal case in which the angle with respect to the shock normal exceeds @xmath14 . then , in the shock front rest frame , the magnetic field lies mostly perpendicular to the flow direction , as the transverse components are amplified by a factor @xmath15 while the parallel component remains unchanged by the lorentz transform . for an oblique shock wave , the above magnetization parameter thus measures ( up to a @xmath16 factor , with @xmath17 the angle between the shock normal and the magnetic field in the upstream rest frame ) the ratio of the magnetic energy in the shock front frame relative to the incoming matter flux @xmath18 crossing the shock front .",
    "collisionless shock waves can be mediated by three generic types of mechanisms : by an electrostatic potential for incoming protons in an @xmath19 shock , by a magnetic barrier or , if the magnetic field is negligible , by a reflection due to the ponderomotive force of growing waves ahead of the shock transition layer . in the case of the external shock of a gamma - ray burst outflow propagating in the interstellar medium , for example ,",
    "the reflection can take place on a potential barrier or through a ponderomotive force , as the ambient magnetic field is then particularly weak , @xmath20 for @xmath21 g and @xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "however , even weak , the ambient magnetic field can play an important role , as will be seen further on .",
    "the magnetic field at a relativistic shock front is associated with a motional electric field @xmath24 when measured in the shock front frame ( as indicated by the @xmath25 subscript ) , with @xmath26 ( again , up to a factor @xmath27 ) . since the magnetic field is frozen in most parts of the plasma , the transverse component is further increased by the velocity decrease as the upstream incoming plasma approaches the shock transition layer , as seen again in the shock front rest frame",
    ". this magnetic barrier may reflect back a fraction of the incoming protons . in the strongly magnetized case",
    ", @xmath28 , the coherent gyration of the incoming protons and electrons gives rise to the emission of large amplitude electromagnetic waves through the synchrotron maser instability ( langdon et al . 1988 ) .",
    "as these waves travel back upstream , they lead to a form of wakefield acceleration of the electrons , which leads to electron heating at the expense of the incoming protons ( lyubarsky 2006 , hoshino 2008 ) .",
    "the rise of an electrostatic barrier can be described as follows . to reach thermalization through the shock transition layer ,",
    "the electrons need to absorb part of the wave energy , possibly through a kind of anomalous joules heating .",
    "whatever the mechanism , the length required for the electron heating is several inertial length @xmath29 , much smaller than the length scale of the precursor .",
    "as electrons remain approximatively in boltzmann equilibrium , their density increase in the shock transition by a compression factor @xmath30 is accompanied by a potential variation @xmath31 such that @xmath32 . if the electrons are heated to equipartition with the protons in the downstream plasma , their temperature @xmath33 in the downstream plasma . in an electron - proton shock",
    ", it thus seems unavoidable to have a potential barrier that reflects part of the incoming protons ( see also gedalin et al . 2008 ) ; this is an important difference with an electron positron plasma .",
    "if intense waves are excited in the precursor by the reflected particles or by emitted electromagnetic waves , their growth may also reflect part of the particles , notably electrons .",
    "in particular , such a mechanism is warranted to ensure the shock transition in an unmagnetized pair plasma , as evidenced by various pic simulations , see for instance spitkovsky ( 2008b ) .",
    "the composition of the beam of returning particles is an important issue with respect to the development of instabilities in the upstream plasma , in particular whether charge neutralization has been achieved or not . in that respect",
    ", it should be noted that , if electrons are heated to near equipartition with the incoming protons in the shock precursor , the shock itself must behave as if it were a pair shock .",
    "then , the electrostatic barrier can be expected to be negligible and the returning beam is essentially charge neutralized .",
    "whether and to what amount the electrons are heated in the shock precursor depends in turn on the instabilities that are generated in this precursor .",
    "let us denote by @xmath34 the fraction of the incoming ( proton ) energy carried by the electrons as they reach the shock transition layer .",
    "then , @xmath35 if the electrons have not been heated in the precursor , and @xmath36 if equipartition with the ions has been reached",
    ". this parameter @xmath37 is now measured by massive pic simulations ( spitkovsky 2008a , sironi & spitkovsky 2009 , 2011 ) : generally speaking , it is found that @xmath38 for strongly magnetized plasmas , @xmath39 in the intermediate magnetization regime @xmath40 , and @xmath37 rises up to unity again at lower magnetizations .    as discussed in lemoine & pelletier ( 2010 ) , the returning protons and the first generation of accelerated particles form a forward beam of energy @xmath41 . in the following ,",
    "we write @xmath42 the lorentz factor of the protons composing the beam .",
    "if the electrons composing the beam have been heated to equipartition with the protons before being reinjected towards upstream , either through reflection or through shock crossing from downstream toward upstream , they carry a same energy @xmath43 hence their beam plasma frequency is also similar .    in the precursor ,",
    "the trajectory of a reflected proton is a cycloid with an extension upstream that determines the width of the  foot \" region ( i.e. the precursor ) @xmath44 ( measured in the shock front rest frame ) . as measured in the upstream frame , this length scale @xmath45 ; this corresponds to @xmath46 with a larmor radius @xmath47 ; the factor @xmath48 comes from the fact that the reflected protons are caught up by the shock front after having travelled along the larmor circle only @xmath49 before being caught back by the shock front ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg et al .",
    "2001 ) , keeping in mind that the distance between the particle and the front is reduced by a factor @xmath50 ( milosavljevi & nakar 2006 , pelletier et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "when the fermi process develops through cycles of particles crossing the front back and forth , the first cycle always occurs and the particles participating in this first cycle have an energy comparable to that of the reflected protons .",
    "one can thus assimilate the reflected protons to those first cycle particles , and the number of particles involved in the fermi process will only slightly increase with further cycles .",
    "we will note @xmath51 the ratio of the incoming energy density converted into the pressure of these supra - thermal particles : @xmath52 and @xmath53 denotes the proper density of the beam particles ( i.e. , measured in the shock front rest frame ) .",
    "this parameter @xmath51 approximately corresponds to the ratio of the supra - thermal particle density over the upstream particle density measured in this same shock rest frame .      in the case of a current neutralized charged beam , meaning a beam carrying positive and negative charges but zero net current along the shock normal , the leading instabilities at small magnetization are the filamentation mode , the two - stream instabilities , in particular the erenkov resonance mode with electrostatic modes ( or with modes of wavenumber parallel to the magnetic field in the case of a magnetized plasma ) or with whistler modes ( for an electron - proton plasma ) .",
    "the filamentation instability takes place at small real frequencies @xmath54 and small parallel wavenumber @xmath55 relatively to the transverse wavenumbers ( parallel and tranverse are defined relatively to the shock normal ) , while the two - stream electrostatic instability takes place at resonance @xmath56 , @xmath57 in the upstream rest frame , with @xmath58 the background plasma frequency .",
    "such charge driven current neutralized instabilities are of course generic in the case of pair shocks .",
    "however , even in that case , one must expect a transverse current to rise at the tip of the precursor , as a consequence of charge splitting in the external magnetic field .",
    "this current then generates a compensating current in the background plasma , which induces a buneman instability , which itself leads to efficient heating of the background electrons in the shock precursor .",
    "this issue will be addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec : curr - inst ] .    in the case of an electron - proton plasma , the beam can be current neutralized if , as mentioned above , the incoming upstream electrons are preheated to near equipartition with the protons during the crossing of the precursor ; then , for all practical matters , the shock transition resembles that of a pair shock and the returning beam carries a vanishing current . of course , in that case as well",
    ", one expects the transverse current to emerge in a magnetized upstream plasma and give rise to a buneman type instability , see sec .",
    "[ sec : curr - inst ] . as mentioned before ,",
    "such near equipartition has been observed in pic simulations in both the high and low magnetization limits in oblique collisionless shock waves ( sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) . at high magnetization ,",
    "electron heating in the precursor is due to wakefield acceleration associated to the ponderomotive force of the large amplitude waves emitted by the synchrotron maser instability ( lyubarsky 2006 , hoshino 2008 ) . at low magnetization",
    ", electron heating appears to be related to the development of micro - instabilities in the shock precursor .",
    "such micro - turbulent heating can be understood as follows .",
    "consider for simplicity the fully unmagnetized limit and select the upstream rest frame ; assume further that the shock has reached a stationary state .",
    "the micro - turbulence is excited on a length scale @xmath59 that differs from the previous value of the foot length @xmath60 , as we now neglect any pre - existing magnetic field and assume that scattering is dominated by the micro - turbulence ( see milosavlejvi & nakar 2006 , pelletier et al .",
    "the magnitude of this length scale is such that the transverse momenta of returning particles diffuse by an amount @xmath61 during their travel time @xmath62 in this precursor .",
    "the prefactor @xmath63 corresponds , as before , to the difference between the return timescale of the accelerated particles and the precursor light crossing time . for returning / accelerated particles , the momentum @xmath64 .",
    "diffusion of momenta takes place through scatterings on small ( plasma ) scale electromagnetic fields .",
    "such small scale fields equally contribute to heating the upstream plasma electrons , provided that the electric wave energy content is not much smaller than its magnetic counterpart .",
    "however , the upstream electrons only experience the length scale @xmath65 during a light crossing time @xmath66 . consequently , their momentum dispersion amounts to @xmath67 once the electrons reach the shock front , which corresponds to equipartition with the incoming ions .    to go one step further , one can easily conceive that the preheating of the electrons to near equipartition in the precursor provides the only means to achieve near neutralization of the returning particle current .",
    "if indeed electrons are not preheated in the precursor but simply overturned ( by say , the micro - turbulence ) , their lorentz factor is increased by a factor @xmath68 but their energy remains a factor @xmath69 below that of the returning proton beam .",
    "consequently , their penetration length scale is also a factor @xmath69 smaller and for all relevant purposes , the beam can be considered as essentially composed of protons .    in short ,",
    "a net current along the shock normal in the upstream plasma may arise if and only if the electrons have not been heated to equipartition with the incoming ions by the time they reach the shock front . according to the recent pic simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) , parallel shock waves offer such an example",
    "in which the electrons reach the shock transition with an energy that is significantly less than that of the protons .",
    "it is then natural to expect current instabilities , such as the bell ( 2004 ) instability  more exactly , its relativistic generalization , see reville et al .",
    "( 2006 )  to develop in the upstream plasma ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "this will be discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : coldback ] and [ sec : hotback ] , we concentrate on the filamentation and two stream instabilites and we discuss their development once the finite angular dispersion of the beam of accelerated particles has been taken into account , and considering the possibility that the electrons of the background ( upstream ) plasma have been preheated through the micro - turbulence to relativistic temperatures . following the approximation scheme discussed in our previous paper ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 )",
    ", we consider the micro - instabilities triggered in the ambient plasma by the returning beam over a length scale that is limited by a low background magnetization . in that paper , which discussed the instabilities under the assumption of a unidirectional beam and a cold ambient plasma",
    ", we showed that the weibel - filamentation instability and the oblique two stream instability in particular are very weakly modified by the magnetic field during their linear growth , notably because the maximum length scale of the precursor is always much smaller than the larmor radius of the beam .",
    "moreover the magnetization of the ambient plasma is always assumed much smaller than unity .",
    "thus , in this paper , we neglect the contribution of the magnetic field to the dispersion tensor .",
    "of course , such a contribution can not be neglected when discussing the development of whistler waves .",
    "however we do not consider such an instability in the present paper as one of our conclusions is that upstream electrons are heated towards equipartition , which quenches the development of whistler waves .",
    "henceforth , we consider a current neutralized beam composed of electrons and protons moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath70 in the upstream rest frame . in this section , we furthermore assume the background plasma to be cold .",
    "we model the beam with the following axisymmetric waterbag distribution function : @xmath71 introducing the velocity variables @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the @xmath74component of the beam momentum .",
    "the beam thus propagates towards @xmath75 ( parallel direction ) and suffers from angular dispersion in the perpendicular plane , as characterized by the ratio @xmath76 .    in the case of particles returning from or through a relativistic shock of lorentz factor @xmath15 and propagating in the unshocked plasma , the amount of angular dispersion is known to be @xmath77 .",
    "this result is dictated by kinematics : given that the shock front is always trailing right behind the accelerated particle , once the parallel velocity of this latter drops below @xmath78 , i.e. once the perpendicular velocity of this latter exceeds @xmath79 , the particle is caught back by the shock wave ( gallant & achterberg 1999 , achterberg et al .",

    "the growth rate of the instability is maximal at a wavenumber @xmath229 , which varies as the inverse square root of the electron temperature .",
    "conversely , a larger electron temperature implies a larger spatial scale for the mode of maximum growth rate .",
    "section  [ sec : intro - inst ] has discussed the possibility of current drivent instabilities at relativistic shocks . in particular , we have argued that a net parallel current in the beam of returning particles may emerge at oblique shock waves ( in the upstream frame ) if the electrons of the upstream plasma are not heated to equipartition with the protons by the time they are overtaken by the shock front .",
    "we have also indicated that , independently of charge neutralization of the returning beam , a net perpendicular current may rise through charge splitting in an external magnetic field . in the following ,",
    "we discuss these possibilities in turn .",
    "if the shock foot does not preheat the incoming electrons efficiently , a parallel current with typical ( upstream rest frame ) intensity @xmath230 rises in the shock precursor .",
    "even if a substantial fraction of the incoming electrons were reflected at the shock front , the above current would rise , simply because these electrons would carry an energy @xmath231 that of the reflected protons ( in the absence of preheating ) , hence their penetration length scale in the upstream would be very small compared to that of the protons .",
    "this current gives rise to a compensating return current in the upstream plasma , which may destabilize the pre - existing magnetic field on large spatial scales , see reville et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for parallel relativistic shock waves .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for realistic values of @xmath51 and @xmath15 , the current exceeds @xmath232 , hence it can not be simply compensated by a non - relativistic drift of the upstream electrons relatively to the ions . in order to understand how compensation takes place , it is instructive to go the shock frame , in which the parallel current @xmath233 is associated to the charge density @xmath234 .",
    "note that the parallel current can be maintained in the shock front frame only if there is a net flow of particles escaping toward upstream ; this therefore implicitly means a subluminal ( parallel ) shock configuration .",
    "although the shock structure is not strictly speaking stationary in this case , we assume here that it evolves on long timescales . in this frame ,",
    "the incoming electrons and protons enter the precursor with lorentz factor @xmath15 and density @xmath235 .",
    "if the electron fluid is suddenly slowed by an obstacle from velocity @xmath78 down to velocity @xmath236 , its shock frame density jumps by a factor @xmath237 but the electron current @xmath238  which is positive as the electrons flow in the negative @xmath239 direction  remains conserved .",
    "therefore , the total incoming @xmath240 current must remain zero . given that immediately before entering the precursor , the incoming @xmath240 current vanishes ,",
    "while immediately within the precursor , the cosmic ray current does not vanish , it is easy to see that one can not balance the current by simply slowing down the incoming electrons or protons .    in order to achieve charge and current neutralization within the precursor , it is actually necessary to reflect part of the electrons .",
    "let us assume that a fraction @xmath241 is reflected back towards upstream at entrance into the precursor and that electrons and protons move with respective velocities @xmath236 and @xmath242 within the precursor .",
    "the incoming proton current @xmath243 , the incoming electron current @xmath244 , the incoming proton charge @xmath245 and the incoming electron charge @xmath246 . charge and current neutralization within the precursor thus requires @xmath247 in this case , most of the compensating current in the background plasma is carried by the incoming protons , while the repelling and the slowing down of the electrons ensure charge balance . as the incoming protons are further decelerated by energy exchange with the incoming electrons through micro - instabilities , the above relation between @xmath236 and @xmath242 must remain valid to preserve charge neutralization . of course , @xmath51 itself varies with location , decreasing roughly exponentially ahead of the shock front .",
    "then , the above indicate that electrons are slowed down progressively as they cross the precursor ; in the limit @xmath248 , @xmath249 , leading to efficient slowing - down of the electrons . clearly , one should seek this effect in current particle - in - cell simulations",
    ".    the pic simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) indicate that the generation of turbulence does not lead to efficient preheating of the electrons in the usptream .",
    "one may likely relate this to the magnetic nature of the modes excited by the bell instability , which do not contain significant electric wave energy in the upstream frame . nonetheless , the precursor length scale increases in time in the case of parallel shock waves , because a fraction of the accelerated particles can propagate to upstream infinity in such a configuration ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "hence , the structure of the precursor should itself evolve in time : as the length scale of the precursor increases , incoming electrons experience heating for a longer duration and arrive at the shock front with a larger fraction of the incoming ion energy ; if this fraction eventually becomes comparable to unity , the upstream parallel current disappears and the bell instability shuts off .",
    "unfortunately , present pic simulations have not been able to explore the evolution of the precursor on such long timescales .    in the case of oblique shock waves ,",
    "the simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) indicate that the preheating of the electrons does not take place efficiently at intermediate magnetisations @xmath250 .",
    "there is no parallel current in this case in the shock frame , only a net charge as discussed in pelletier et al .",
    "a priori , one might expect preheating to occur through a buneman instability induced by the perpendicular current ( see further below ) .",
    "however , as will be shown in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : inst - buneman ] , the magnetization is so large that the buneman mode does not have time to grow before it is advected through the shock front , unless the shock lorentz factor takes quite moderate values .",
    "hence , it should not bear a significant impact on the structure of the precursor .",
    "let us assume that the accelerated particle beam carries a net current and induces a compensating return current in the background plasma .",
    "this situation applies equally well to the case of a parallel ( sec .",
    "[ sec : inst - paral - current ] ) or a perpendicular current ( sec .",
    "[ sec : inst - perp - current ] ) . the relativistic motion of the background electrons relative to the background ions then induces a relativistic version of the buneman instability ( buneman 1959 ) .    in the upstream rest frame , the relevant dispersion relation , including the relativistic motion of the background electrons with velocity @xmath251 ( lorentz factor @xmath252 ) but neglecting the beam contribution , takes the form : @xmath253 = 0 \\ .\\ ] ] the instability develops at frequencies @xmath254 , as the small denominator lies in the second term , not the third one .",
    "thus we may approximate the dispersion relation as @xmath255 where @xmath256^{1/2}$ ] represents the component of @xmath151 transverse to the current .",
    "the above expression then leads to the most unstable mode : @xmath257    as measured in the upstream frame , the advection time across the foot is @xmath258 , with @xmath259 the proton cyclotron frequency in the background magnetic field .",
    "thus the buneman instability can effectively grow if @xmath260 which leads to a condition on the ambient magnetization , as in lemoine & pelletier ( 2010 ) : @xmath261 neglecting the @xmath262 dependence .",
    "this buneman mode turns out to be the fastest instability , although the oblique two stream mode does lie far behind as its growth condition is given by almost the same inequality , except that the right hand side term is multiplied by @xmath263 .",
    "nevertheless , it is well known ( at least in the non - relativistic regime ) that this buneman instability saturates rapidly by heating the electrons to a temperature such that the anisotropy due to the electron current is drowned by the broadened distribution ( i.e. @xmath264 in non - relativistic regime , @xmath265 being the electron thermal velocity , and @xmath266 in relativistic regime ) , in agreement with the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sec : coldback ] . in practice , and if conditions permit it ( notably , magnetization ) , this buneman mode thus serves as an efficient source of electron heating . in turn",
    ", this helps the filamentation mode develop at moderate values of @xmath15 , which could not develop in a cold background plasma given the amount of angular dispersion of the beam , as discussed above .",
    "we now consider an oblique shock wave . in the shock front",
    ", the magnetic field lies perpendicular to the shock normal , to a good approximation ; we assume that @xmath267 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim - struct ] , the returning or acccelerated proton undergoes a cycloidal trajectory in the lorentz transformed background field and accompanying motional electric field , as measured in the shock front frame .",
    "even if the beam does not carry a net parallel current at the beginning of the foot , the charge splitting in the background field leads to a cosmic ray current oriented along @xmath268 .",
    "its magnitude in the upstream rest frame can be straightforwardly estimated as @xmath269 , given that the apparent density of cosmic rays in this rest frame reads @xmath270 but that their effective perpendicular velocity @xmath271 .",
    "the vertical current tends to strongly modify the initial magnetic field in a diamagnetic way .",
    "indeed , the choice of orientation of the field , directed toward @xmath272 , implies that the vertical current is directed toward @xmath273 , so that the magnetic field increases toward @xmath75 , from the shock ramp to the external edge of the foot where it reaches its external value .",
    "a consistent solution thus requires a reduced mean field in the foot .",
    "this remains fully compatible with the shock crossing conditions , which implies an enhancement of the magnetic field strength downstream , when one realizes that a similar current develops behind the shock over a distance measured by a typical larmor radius .",
    "this current develops in an opposite direction downstream to that upstream and thus leads to a reduction of the magnetic field from its far downstream ( asymptotic ) value to the low value close to the ramp .",
    "note that the cycloidal trajectories upstream and downstream have different characteristic gyroradii , due to the compression of the magnetic field .",
    "this diamagnetic effect could be very prohibitive if the perpendicular current were not compensated by the background electrons .",
    "indeed , in the absence of compensation , one would find an induced field @xmath274 such that @xmath275    the modification of the magnetic profile can be calculated as follows .",
    "first we remark that the motional electric field that compensates @xmath276 is uniform throughout the shock transition because @xmath277 , hence @xmath278 .",
    "then , in order to characterize the compensation of the current , we introduce an effective resistivity @xmath279 of the background plasma electrons . at the tip of the precursor , where the beam current is the strongest",
    ", one can not exclude that a `` double layer '' type of structure forms , as in the case of a parallel shock wave .",
    "for the discussion that follows , we ignore this and describe the current compensation on phenomenological grounds by introducing this effective resistivity . in the precursor and in the shock ramp , this resistivity may result from turbulent scattering at frequency @xmath280 , with @xmath281 .",
    "ohm s law for the background plasma then leads to @xmath282 with @xmath283 the background plasma compensating current along @xmath284 .",
    "now the field variation is produced by both the plasma current @xmath283 and the diamagnetic cosmic ray current @xmath285 : @xmath286 using ohm s law to relate @xmath283 with @xmath287 , one thus obtains the following differential equation that governs the spatial profile of the magnetic field : @xmath288 where @xmath289 denotes the resistive length , @xmath290 .",
    "the boundary conditions are as follows : for @xmath291 ( far downstream ) , @xmath292 , the current vanish and @xmath293 ; for @xmath294 ( far upstream ) , @xmath295 , the currents vanish again and @xmath296 . in the downstream region",

    "in the situation that we consider , the magnetic field energy is weak and the incoming plasma is able to provide a compensating current .",
    "the typical length scale over which the compensating current is established , @xmath289 is much smaller than the length scale over which the cosmic ray current is induced @xmath301 , hence one derives the modification of the magnetic field at @xmath302 as @xmath303 with @xmath304 and the compensating current @xmath305 the discrepancy with respect to neutralization of the diamagnetic current is expressed by the derivative term in the above expression , and is of order @xmath306 .",

    "one should expect different physics to come into play in the mildly relativistic limit .",
    "+ the upstream electrons are heated to larger thermal lorentz factors @xmath159 as they come closer to the shock front , hence the above picture must pertain up to the shock front .",
    "if the electron temperature reaches the threshold discussed previously , the two stream instability also becomes efficient . for reference ,",
    "if the electrons reach equipartition with the protons , @xmath159 becomes as large as @xmath311 . at equipartition , the filamentation instability thus becomes similar to that occuring in a pair plasma .",
    "as for the whistler wave instability , it develops only if there is a sufficient contrast between the electron and proton masses .",
    "it thus disappears when the electron relativistic mass reaches the proton mass and the modes become right alfvn waves , which do not have time to grow unless the precursor has been substantially extended through diffusion ( see the discussion in lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) .",
    "\\5 ) the typical perpendicular spatial scale at which the filamentation and two stream instability growth rates reach their maximum scales as @xmath312 , due to the evolution of the background plasma frequency in the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "this suggests that the typical spatial scale of the inhomogeneities increases from the electron inertial scale @xmath313 to the proton inertial scale @xmath314 as the modes come closer to the shock front .",
    "note that the growth rate of the filamentation instability does not depend on the temperature of the background plasma and takes the same value as in the cold plasma limit .",
    "\\6 ) the micro - turbulence that is generated by these instabilities lead to efficient electron heating .",
    "this has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro - inst ] , where it has been argued , in particular , that in the unmagnetized limit , the large scale of the precursor must guarantee heating of the electrons to equipartition with the protons if the wave electric energy content is comparable to the magnetic content .",
    "let us now account for a finite upstream magnetic field , assuming in particular that this magnetic field sets the length scale of the precursor .",
    "the heating process takes place through the diffusion of the electron energy in the bath of micro - turbulence : in fluctuating electric fields @xmath315 on coherence scales @xmath316 , electrons reach a thermal energy @xmath317 such that @xmath318 after crossing the precursor of length @xmath60 .",
    "the turbulence is supposed to reach a level such that it contributes to form the shock , i.e. @xmath319 with @xmath320 being a conversion factor not too far below unity .",
    "this implies a thermal energy @xmath321 . for fiducial values",
    "@xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , the pre - factor is of order unity .",
    "if one imposes furthermore that the magnetization is small enough to guarantee the growth of the filamentation mode , one finds @xmath325 ( lemoine & pelletier 2010 ) , the electrons are heated to lorentz factors @xmath326 , close again to equipartition . +",
    "thus the electrons can be heated in the precursor and roughly thermalized with the protons .",
    "\\7 ) the above considerations agree well with recent pic simulations , at least where comparison can be made .",
    "in particular , electron heating to near equipartition has been observed at small magnetization by sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) , although the detailed physical process that is responsible for this heating has not been identified in these simulations .",
    "the micro - instabilities have been observed to take place at moderate values of the shock lorentz factor @xmath327 and small magnetization @xmath328 ( assuming in these simulations an electron to proton mass ratio of 1/16 ) .",
    "furthermore , the typical scale of the fluctuations apparently grows from the tip of the precursor to the shock front .",
    "\\8 ) finally , we question the possible nonlinear saturation of the instabilities in the precursor .",
    "first of all , one can show that these instabilities can not be saturated by beam particle trapping because the timescale to cross a coherence scale @xmath316 is much less than the growth timescale of the waves @xmath329 ; said otherwise , trapping of the beam particles would require a prohibitive level of turbulence .",
    "this can be seen best by going to the rest frame of the waves in which the electromagnetic fields are static . in this rest frame , the particle cross the transverse coherence length @xmath330 in a timescale @xmath331 , which takes into account the static force exerted by the fields on the particle in this rest frame . as we are interested in the transverse dynamics , one can transform the relevant quantities to the upstream frame as @xmath332 , @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "consider now the example of the filamentation instability , the growth rate of which is @xmath335 .",
    "saturation by trapping would require @xmath336 , which is obviously prohibitive .",
    "this negative conclusion obviously holds equally well for the other instabilities that grow faster , in particular the two stream instability , the whistler mode and the buneman instability .",
    "+ nonlinear effects related to mode coupling thus appear more likely .",
    "even when the electrons have turned relativistically hot , the rate of nonlinear evolution of the unstable modes  as for instance coupling of oblique two stream modes with transverse waves or acoustic waves  is expected of the order of @xmath337 according to zakharov ( 1972 ) , which leads to saturation once the growth rate is balanced by the rate of energy conversion into the other stable modes . for the particular example of the two stream instability , with growth rate @xmath338 ,",
    "this leads to @xmath339 , which is therefore not far below @xmath51 if the electrons have reached equipartition with the ions . as a note of caution , one should point out that the above estimates of saturation ignore a possible bulk lorentz factor of the upstream electrons once they have been heated in the precursor .",
    "such estimates should nevertheless remain correct in the limit of moderate @xmath15 .",
    "the main conclusion of this study of the dispersion and of the thermal effects on the growth of micro - instabilities in the foot of a relativistic shock , is that electron pre - heating can occur , and that this leads to the attenuation of micro - instabilities except the filamentation instability , which keeps the same growth rate , the wavelength of the instability peak migrating from the electron to the proton inertial scale as the electrons are heated to equipartition .",
    "the plasma that reaches the shock ramp is roughly thermalized and behaves like an electron - positron plasma .",
    "hence the following question arises : what makes the reflection of a part of the incoming particles ? under the assumed conditions of a weak magnetization , such that it allows the growth of micro - instabilities , especially the filamentation instability , the role of the ponderomotive force exerted by the growing waves is probably more important than the electrostatic barrier .",
    "this has to be further investigated with dedicated pic simulations .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with a. spitkovsky and l. sironi during the preparation of this work , as well as with i. rabinak and e. waxman .",
    "one of us , g.p .",
    ", is very grateful for the hospitality of the kavli institute for theoretical physics in santa barbara during the summer program of 2009 devoted to these topics ; this was indeed a great opportunity for developing a better understanding that has influenced this paper and others to come , thanks to intense exchanges with many colleagues .",
