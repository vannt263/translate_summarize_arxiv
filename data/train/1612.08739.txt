    "the cubic scalar field theory with classical lagrangian @xmath0 , despite its simplicity , shows a surprisingly rich spectrum of phenomena .",
    "historically , this model in @xmath1 spacetime dimensions has served as a prototype of an asymptotically free theory  @xcite , and was used as a toy model to illustrate several aspects of qcd @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is remarkable that a particular cubic theory of @xmath2 scalars , which can be mapped to the @xmath3-states potts model @xcite , in the limit @xmath4 belongs to the same universality class of the reggeon field theory and the directed percolation model @xcite .",
    "indeed , the most fertile area of application for this kind of theories is offered by critical phenomena .",
    "a celebrated case of study is that of a single real scalar field , known as the lee - yang model , which has upper critical dimension @xmath1 and provides a ginzburg - landau description of a peculiar critical point @xcite , the yang - lee edge singularity  @xcite .",
    "this model provides an outstanding example of universality since , while stemming from the thermodynamic properties of ising ferromagnets in @xmath5 dimensions  @xcite , it governs the negative - activity singularity of fluid models with repulsive - core interactions in the same dimensionality  @xcite , directed branched polymers ( directed loop - free lattice animals ) in @xmath6 dimensions  @xcite , anderson localization phenomena  @xcite and isotropic branched polymers ( undirected lattice animals )  @xcite , both in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "the latter correspondence descends from a beautiful connection with a @xmath8 supersymmetric model in @xmath7 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "away from criticality the simple cubic model seems to be plagued by a terminal illness : the instability of the bare potential which is believed to generically result into an unbounded - from - below energy spectrum . however",
    ", this conclusion has been questioned by several authors , and two notable mechanisms to stabilize the theory have been proposed . on the one hand",
    ", the stability of the model might be tied to @xmath9 symmetry  @xcite , which is present at criticality , as signaled for instance by the imaginary value of the cubic coupling @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the theory might be rescued through the inclusion of additional degrees of freedom , such as @xmath2 scalars with @xmath11 symmetry , provided that the seemingly unstable cubic direction actually behaves as a non - dynamical auxiliary field  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the quartic model , the cubic scalar model is generally not exactly solvable .",
    "the main properties of the critical theory are exactly known only in @xmath12  @xcite , and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in the latter case it has been argued that the two - dimensional conformal field theory corresponding to the lee - yang universality class is the minimal @xmath14 model which arises as a representation of the virasoro algebra @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it has been argued that the lee - yang model is only the first element of a sequence of two - dimensional multicritical theories @xcite which are captured by the minimal models @xmath15 for @xmath16 and whose critical phases are reached by tuning the magnetic field to a purely imaginary value @xcite",
    ". the second element of this sequence @xmath17 describes the tricritical phase of the blume - capel model for spin - chains , and thus could have application to models of atomic mixtures @xcite .    in more than two dimensions ,",
    "the full understanding of the dynamics of the lee - yang theory requires an intricate web of different approximations .",
    "several methods have been applied to the study of the critical model , ranging from the @xmath18-expansion  @xcite to strong coupling expansions  @xcite , and from lattice simulations  @xcite to the conformal bootstrap  @xcite . as a complementary approach ,",
    "the use of functional renormalization group ( frg ) techniques is very well suited to this problem , since it can be naturally generalized to any continuous dimension ( from high to low @xmath5 ) without the need of resummations or extrapolations , in any regime ( both weakly or strongly coupled , massive or massless ) , and to a wide family of models at once including arbitrary real or complex couplings or bare actions ( e.g.  generic interacting potentials )  @xcite .",
    "a first exploratory frg analysis of the yang - lee edge singularity has recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "the results of this investigation pave the way to a more extensive and in - depth analysis of the universal properties of this model , which should be tested against change of both approximation strategies and regulator choices , as well as improvements of the numerical analysis .",
    "the present work precisely goes in this direction .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : frg ] we describe the frg method , the regularization - scheme , and the approximations within which we perform our analysis . in sect .",
    "[ sec : derivative_expansion ] we obtain the most accurate frg estimates for the critical theory in @xmath19 as of now , and report on issues that future works will have to face in order to push this description to lower dimensions . in sect .",
    "[ sec : imaginary_approximation ] we describe a simpler approximation that captures the essence of the model for all dimensionalities @xmath20 and shows a tower of multicritical @xmath21 theories arising below their upper critical dimension . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we summarize the results and outline the future directions that should be taken .",
    "to investigate the renormalization group ( rg ) flow of the cubic scalar theory we focus on truncations of the exact rg equation for a flowing effective action @xmath22 $ ] , the generating functional of 1pi vertices , whose dependence on rg - time @xmath23 is induced by a mass - like regulator with kernel @xmath24 , which additively deforms the exact inverse propagator @xmath25 the corresponding rg equation is exact , but has the simple structure of a one - loop equation  @xcite @xmath26=\\frac{1}{2}{\\rm tr}\\left[\\partial_t r_k\\left(\\gamma_k^{(2)}[\\varphi]+r_k\\right)^{-1}\\right].\\ ] ] this is usually not exactly solvable , but it allows for perturbative approximations , both within the framework of the @xmath27-expansion  @xcite and at the upper critical dimension  @xcite .",
    "a different and complementary approximation strategy is based on non - perturbative truncations , which require projecting the rg flow on a treatable subset of functionals , ideally as large as possible .    in this work",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the following parametrization of the dynamics @xmath28=\\int\\ !",
    "d^dx \\left [ \\frac{1}{2 } z_k(\\varphi)\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\partial^\\mu\\varphi+v_k(\\varphi)\\right]\\ ] ] which can be considered as the @xmath29 of a systematic derivative expansion of the effective action .",
    "we will adopt as regulator a step - linear shape function that in ( euclidean ) momentum space reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the standard heaviside function and @xmath32 is a free parameter . this functional kernel is chosen to optimize the results of the truncation of  eq .   in scalar models like the present one  @xcite .",
    "our focus is on the nontrivial scaling solution with upper critical dimension @xmath1 , which corresponds to a non - gauian fixed point ( fp ) of the rg flow of dimensionless renormalized quantities @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the anomalous dimension of the field at the fp .",
    "we choose the normalization @xmath35 , and probe the spurious dependence of universal quantities on the overall normalization of the action , induced by truncations of the theory space , by varying the regulator parameter @xmath36 .",
    "since we will always refer to dimensionless renormalized quantities at the floating scale @xmath37 , we will drop both the @xmath37- and @xmath38-subscripts in what follows .",
    "the beta functionals for the truncation have been presented in  @xcite using a power - law cutoff instead of . in brief , the flow of the scale - dependent potential is computed from the constant - field limit of , while the flow of the wave function is computed from the flow of the two - point function , which is obtained by taking two functional derivatives of .",
    "our beta functionals are considerably more complex than those that appeared in @xcite , both because of the step - function and because of the presence of the additional parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the explicit form of these beta functionals is not particularly illuminating , so we will provide them in the form of ancillary files .",
    "in this section we analyze the coupled system of equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we project the flow of these functions on the following polynomial basis @xmath41 the flow obeys the following properties @xcite : the equation for @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while the equation for @xmath47 depends on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 and @xmath48 .",
    "this translates into a precise hierarchy for the polynomial couplings .",
    "the flow equation for @xmath51 depends on couplings up to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , while that for @xmath54 involves parameters up to @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , @xmath57 does not appear in the beta functions of all the other couplings , as it is immediately visible from the right hand side of  eq .  .",
    "since the fp condition is a set of two second - order ordinary differential equations , the solution is completely determined by four numbers , that can be chosen as @xmath58 .     in @xmath59 , as a function of the regulator parameter @xmath36 , for several orders of the polynomial truncation @xmath60 ( @xmath61).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the critical exponents can be computed by diagonalizing the stability matrix corresponding to the linearized flow at the fp and by extracting its eigenvalues @xmath62 .",
    "the flow equations admit two relevant critical exponents that are related to the anomalous dimension through two scaling relations @xmath63 for example , to prove that  eq",
    ".   holds , it suffices to compare the linearized equations to the @xmath64-derivative of the fp equations  @xcite . while eq .",
    "is preserved by the polynomial truncations of  eq .  , eq .",
    "in fact , one can use its violation @xmath65 as a measure of the quality of the truncation @xcite .",
    "eq.s   and   also show that the anomalous dimension completely determines all the relevant critical properties of the lee - yang model . and @xmath66 , the latter one governing the scaling of the correlation length . ]",
    "in addition to @xmath34 , it is customary to define the critical exponent @xmath67 which is essentially the inverse of the thermodynamical exponent @xmath68 , and in fact it governs the distribution of the yang - lee edge as a function of the imaginary magnetic field .",
    ", as defined in  eq .  , at the @xmath59 fixed point , as a function of the regulator parameter @xmath36 , for several orders of the polynomial truncation @xmath60 ( @xmath61).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    by construction , inserting the classical action into  eq .   and expanding in powers of @xmath69 reproduces the one - loop expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath34 .",
    "these are thus included in the @xmath71 polynomial truncation , which comprehends all the classically relevant and marginal couplings , and for which the fp can be easily located at negative values of @xmath72 and @xmath34 .",
    "several strategies are conceivable on how to systematically increase the separate orders @xmath73 and @xmath60 . however , as tested in  @xcite in a similar context , the inclusion of interactions in order of their classical dimensionality appears to maximize the convergence rate .",
    "this is to be expected as long as the anomalous dimensions are small enough , and one can trust the gauian notion of relevance of an operator . as a concequence , in the following we will report on the results that descend from setting @xmath61 and increasing @xmath60 .",
    "let us first discuss several properties of the polynomial truncations by remaining close to the upper critical dimension and setting @xmath59 . already at low orders in @xmath60 ,",
    "an important issue is the regulator dependence of universal quantities like @xmath34 .",
    "the stronger this is , the less accurate is the chosen truncation of theory space  eq .  .",
    "in fact , in @xmath59 this dependence is rather weak , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : eta_vs_a_59d ] .",
    "interestingly , increasing @xmath60 does not significantly mitigate the regulator dependence of @xmath34 .",
    "it is possible to minimize the latter at almost every @xmath60 , by locating an @xmath36-stationary point which appears to converge around @xmath74 for larger and larger @xmath60 .",
    "this numerically agrees with the value of @xmath36 that minimizes the violation of the second scaling relation , as it is visible in fig .",

    "[ fig : deltalambda2_vs_nz ] .",
    "indeed , the series of @xmath34 against @xmath60 is convergent , see fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence_eta_59d ] .",
    "the rate of convergence does depend on @xmath36 , and it does not seem to be maximal at the point that minimizes the sensitivity of @xmath34 , but close to it , as it can be observed by comparing fig.s  [ fig : eta_vs_a_59d ] and  [ fig : convergence_eta_59d ] .    ensuring the maximum convergence rate becomes crucial for the sake of lowering @xmath5 .",
    "[ fig : eta_vs_a_5d ] and  [ fig : eta_vs_a_4d ] illustrate several important facts .",
    "first , the dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath36 becomes stronger for lower @xmath5 .",
    "this signals that in lower dimensions the theory becomes strongly coupled and the simple parametrization of  eq .",
    "is less adequate .",
    "second , the value of @xmath36 for which the dependence is minimized moves when @xmath5 changes .",
    "this , combined with the technical problem that following the fp at higher @xmath60 is difficult in regions where the @xmath36-dependence is strong , forces us to continuously relocate the stationarity point while changing @xmath5 and @xmath60 .",
    "let us remark that the minimization of the @xmath36-dependence of @xmath34 is performed also at orders in @xmath60 much higher than those displayed in fig.s  [ fig : eta_vs_a_5d ] and  [ fig : eta_vs_a_4d ] , yet in a smaller domain .",
    "third , the overall convergence rate of the polynomial truncation decreases quickly for lower @xmath5 , which can be appreciated by comparing the violation of the second scaling relation in @xmath59 and @xmath75 , as shown in the left and right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltalambda2_vs_nz ] respectively .",
    "nevertheless , in both @xmath75 and @xmath76 it is possible to see convergence of the polynomial truncations , but this requires orders in @xmath60 which are much higher than those studied in  @xcite , where results were obtained up to @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( though for polynomials centered around a non - zero @xmath64 ) .",
    "[ fig : convergence_eta_5d ] shows that in @xmath75 convergence at less than 1% can be achieved already with @xmath79 . having reached @xmath80 allows us to extract the value @xmath81 at the optimized point @xmath74 , within the truncation of  eq .  .",
    "for @xmath76 , at @xmath79 the anomalous dimension still oscillates at the level of 4% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence_eta_4d ] , and we need to push the numerics up to @xmath82 to obtain @xmath83 at the optimized value @xmath84 within the truncation of  eq .  .     in @xmath75 , as a function of the regulator parameter @xmath36 , for several orders of the polynomial truncation.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]     in @xmath76 , as a function of the regulator parameter @xmath36 , for several orders of the polynomial truncation.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "these fps can be smoothly connected with the perturbative region around @xmath1 by analytically continuing the flow equation in the dimensionality , such that their identification as non - spurious solutions is unambiguous .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fp_vs_d ] illustrates how @xmath34 and the mass parameter @xmath85 decrease side by side as @xmath5 is lowered , a fact that has no parallel in the mass - independent scheme usually adopted to construct the @xmath27-expansion , in which @xmath86 at the fp . the lower panel of fig .  [ fig : fp_vs_d ] shows that the cubic couplings @xmath69 and @xmath87 are instead non monotonic . while in the perturbative region close to @xmath1 the non - derivative vertex clearly dominates over the momentum - dependent one , the two become of the same order of magnitude in @xmath88 , which indicates that most likely this applies also to other derivative interactions neglected in our truncation  eq .  .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that below @xmath76 the present order of the derivative expansion will be far from accurate .     in @xmath75 as a function of the order of the polynomial truncation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]     in @xmath76 as a function of the order of the polynomial truncation.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    unfortunately , we are not able to report on the value of @xmath34 in @xmath89 , because the search for roots of the fp equation becomes extremely cumbersome below @xmath76 , such that in changing @xmath5 , @xmath36 and @xmath60 the algorithm is very easily attracted to spurious solutions ( typically while incrementing @xmath60 ) or can not find any fp at all ( typically while lowering @xmath5 ) . to understand the origin of the problem , we can rely only on low - order truncations , for which probing several @xmath36 and @xmath5 values is much easier .",
    "the results indicate that the main reason for these technical difficulties is the slow rate of convergence of the polynomial truncation in lower dimensions , combined with the stronger @xmath36-dependence of the fp itself .",
    "regarding optimization , the minimum - sensitivity value of @xmath36 grows while @xmath5 decreases , from @xmath74 close to @xmath1 to roughly @xmath90 in @xmath89 .",
    "low - order truncations show that for @xmath91 the value of @xmath34 undergoes a rapid change across @xmath92 . as a consequence , even though the behavior of @xmath34 in @xmath93 suggests that for @xmath94 there might be further stationarity points , we have not been able to systematically probe that region .",
    "concerning the slow convergence rate , it appears to significantly affect the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath34 , which is non - monotonic far from six dimensions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_vs_d_nz4_nz7_nz9 ] , for each order of the polynomial truncation the anomalous dimension reaches a minimum at some @xmath5 and then it grows in lower dimensions .",
    "the fact that the location of the minimum is pushed towards lower @xmath5 by increasing @xmath60 , suggests that this non - monotonicity is an artifact of polynomial truncations .",
    "unfortunately , for higher @xmath60 we are not able to follow the fp from @xmath76 down to @xmath89 , probably because of the combination of the increasing complexity of the system of algebraic equations and the rapid change of the fp position for @xmath5 slightly above the position of the minimum of @xmath34 , as visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_vs_d_nz4_nz7_nz9 ] .",
    "finally , from the behavior of the rate of convergence in @xmath95 we suspect that , even if we could follow the genuine fp down to @xmath89 for higher @xmath60 , to determine @xmath34 with a reasonable precision we would still need to probe values of @xmath60 outside of our available computing power .",
    "for all these reasons , we believe that the best way to study this fp in lower dimensions is to abandon polynomial truncations and to use numerical algorithms such as discretization of field space or pseudo - spectral methods  @xcite . the next question would then be , whether the @xmath29 derivative expansion is able to give a qualitatively correct description of the lee - yang edge singularity in @xmath96 , and if so to which level of accuracy .",
    "so far , we are able to provide an answer only for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as summarized in tab .  [ tab : tablenlo ] .",

    "<S> we give estimates for the critical exponents , study the dependence on the regularization scheme , and show the convergence of our results for increasing size of the truncations in four and five dimensions . while with our truncations it is numerically challenging to approach the three - dimensional case , we provide a simple approximation which allows us to qualitatively study the lee - yang model in two and three dimensions , and use it to argue the existence of further non - unitary multicritical theories including one which is relevant for the universality class of the blume - capel model . </S>"
