    "the analogy of the statistical fluctuations of dynamical systems and disordered systems is well - known in the delocalized wave - regime ( corresponding to the metallic limit in disordered systems and the classically chaotic limit in dynamical systems ) and has been explained using random matrix theory as a tool @xcite . a similar analogy exists for fully localized regimes of the wavefunctions too ( i.e. between the insulator limit of disordered systems and the integrable limit of dynamical systems )",
    "it is therefore natural to probe the presence/ absence of the analogy in partially localized/ critical regimes of these systems .",
    "our analysis shows that , similar to the @xmath0 anderson hamiltonian ( @xmath1 as dimension ) , the @xmath2 quantum kicked rotor ( qkr ) undergoes a localization - delocalization transition in the classically mixed regime .",
    "we also find quantum phase transitions in its chaotic regime due to breaking of the symmetries e.g. time - reversal and parity in the quantum system .",
    "similar to disordered systems , the symmetry - breaking transitions in the qkr occur due to weak - localization effects .",
    "similar phase transitions due to symmetry - breakings have been seen in a few other complex systems too e.g. the ensembles of distinguishable spins @xcite .",
    "the connection of the kicked rotor to the @xmath2 anderson hamiltonian has been known for several decades @xcite .",
    "a recent work @xcite further explores the connection and shows that , for the non - analytic potentials in the qkr , the eigenstates show multifractality or power - law localization @xcite , a behavior similar to the eigenstates of a @xmath0 dimensional anderson hamiltonian @xcite at its critical point .",
    "our study shows existence of the multifractal eigenstates in the qkr with smooth potentials too e.g. @xmath3 at specific parametric conditions .",
    "furthermore , similar to a critical anderson system , the multifractality in the qkr is accompanied by a critical level statistics ( size - independent and different from the two ends of the transition ) , a necessary criteria for the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "this indicates a much deeper connectivity of the kicked rotor to the anderson hamiltonian , not affected just by the nature of the potential or the dimension of system . as discussed here",
    ", the connection seems to be mainly governed by the `` degree of complexity '' ( measured by the complexity parameter discussed later ) and may exist among a wider range of dynamical and disordered systems .",
    "the present study is motivated by a recent analytical work @xcite leading to a common mathematical formulation for the statistical fluctuations of a wide range of complex systems .",
    "the work , based on the ensemble - averaging , shows that the fluctuations are governed by a single parameter @xmath4 besides global - constraints on the system @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 referred as the complexity parameter , turns out to be a function of the average accuracy of the matrix elements , measured in units of the mean - level spacing .",
    "the fluctuations in two different systems , subjected to similar global - constraints , are analogous if their complexity parameters are equal irrespective of other system - details .",
    "the @xmath4-formulation was recently used by us to find the gaussian brownian ensemble ( gbe ) @xcite analog and the power - law random banded matrix ensemble ( prbme ) @xcite analog of the anderson system ( for arbitrary @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "however it can not directly be applied to find the qkr analog ; this is , in principle , due to inapplicability of the ensemble averaging to dynamical systems .",
    "fortunately it is possible to derive @xmath4 for dynamical systems by a semi - classical route , using the phase - space averages @xcite .",
    "the `` semi - classical '' @xmath4 was used by us @xcite to map the statistics of the time - evolution operator @xmath5 of the qkr to the circular brownian ensembles ( cbe ) @xcite . the lack of a suitable criteria for the critical statistical behavior prevented us earlier from a critical qkr - analysis .",
    "our present work pursues the analysis by first analytically identifying the critical qkr - behavior using the `` semi - classical '' @xmath6 ; the limit @xmath7 , with @xmath8 independent of the size @xmath9 , gives the critical points of transition .",
    "this is followed by a numerical analysis of an ensemble of the qkr which confirms critical behavior at the semi - classically predicted values .",
    "this in turn suggests a paradoxical validity of the ensemble averaging in dynamical systems at least of qkr type ; ( also indicated by the cbe - qkr mapping ) .",
    "a subsequent comparison of the `` semi - classical '' @xmath10 to the `` ensemble - based '' @xmath11 of the anderson hamiltonian ( arbitrary @xmath1 ) gives us its qkr analog ; the analogy is numerically confirmed too .    the statistical behavior in the bulk of the spectrum of a standard gaussian ensemble is known to be analogous to a standard circular ensemble ( for large matrix sizes ) @xcite .",
    "our work extends this analogy to their brownian ensemble counterparts too , that is , between the gbe and the cbe ( by the mapping gbe @xmath12 ae @xmath12 qkr @xmath12 cbe ) .",
    "this in turn indicates a connection among a wide - range of physical systems which are known to be well - modeled by the anderson hamiltonian , the kicked rotor and the brownian ensembles of gaussian and circular type .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the section ii briefly reviews the basic features of the kicked rotor and the anderson hamiltonian required for our analysis ; it also discusses the parametric conditions in the kicked rotor which can support critical points .",
    "the section iii deals with the numerical confirmation of the critical level - statistics and the multifractality of the eigenfunctions at critical parametric conditions in the qkr and their comparison with a @xmath13 dimensional anderson hamiltonian . we conclude in section iv with a brief discussion of our main results and open questions .",
    "the kicked rotor and the anderson hamiltonian have been subjects of intense study in past and many of their details can be found in several references @xcite . however ,",
    "for self consistency of the paper , we present here a few details required for later discussion .",
    "the kicked rotor can be described as a pendulum subjected to periodic kicks ( of time - period @xmath14 ) with hamiltonian @xmath15 given as    @xmath16    here @xmath17 is the stochasticity parameter , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the time - reversal and parity symmetry breaking parameters in the quantum hamiltonian while acting in a finite hilbert space .",
    "integration of the equations of motion @xmath20 , @xmath21 between subsequent kicks e.g. @xmath22 and @xmath23 gives the classical map ,    @xmath24    the map is area - preserving and invariant under the discrete translation @xmath25 .",
    "it also preserves the time - reversal symmetry @xmath26 and the parity @xmath27 for all values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus the classical dynamics depends only on @xmath17 , changing from integrable ( @xmath28 ) to near integrable ( @xmath29 ) to large scale chaos ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the quantum dynamics can be described by a discrete time - evolution operator @xmath31 @xcite where @xmath32 \\\\",

    "the quantum dynamics can then be confined to a two dimensional torus ( with a hilbert space of finite size @xmath45 with @xmath46 an integer ) .",
    "the classical analog of this model corresponds to the standard mapping on a torus of size @xmath47 in the momentum @xmath37 ; thus the classical limit is @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xcite .    for the dynamical - localization analysis , it is useful to express the matrix @xmath5 in the momentum - basis @xcite :    @xmath51 \\sum_{l =- n_1}^{n_1 }   { \\rm exp}\\left[-i\\ ; k \\ ; { \\rm cos}\\left(2\\pi l /n + \\theta_0 \\right)\\right ] { \\rm exp}\\left[-2 \\pi i l ( m - n)/n \\right ] \\label{u}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath52 with @xmath53 if @xmath9 is odd and @xmath54 if @xmath9 is even .",
    "it is clear that the properties of @xmath15 , eq.([h ] ) , are recovered in the infinite matrix size limit .",
    "the quantum dynamics under exact symmetry conditions ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) can significantly be affected by relative values of @xmath57 .",
    "it was first conjectured @xcite and later on verified @xcite that the statistical properties are governed by the ratio of the localization length @xmath58 to the total number of states @xmath9 or , equivalently , @xmath59 ( as @xmath60 with @xmath61 as the diffusion constant ) .",
    "however , to best of our knowledge , the critical behavior at @xmath62 was not probed before .",
    "the other parameters playing a crucial role in the quantum dynamics are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the measures of time - reversal and parity - symmetry breaking respectively ( with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "note the change of @xmath65 or @xmath66 is a canonical transformation , thus leaving the classical hamiltonian unaffected .",
    "the corresponding quantum dynamics , however , is affected as the quantum hamiltonian acting in a finite hilbert space may not remain invariant under a unitary transformation .",
    "following eq.([u ] ) , the multi - parametric nature of @xmath5 is expected to manifest itself in the statistical behavior of its eigenvalues ( quasi - energies ) and the eigenfunctions . however , as shown in @xcite using semi - classical techniques , the quasi - energy statistics of @xmath5 is sensitive to a single parameter @xmath10 and the exact symmetry - conditions . under exact time - reversal symmetry ( @xmath55 ) and partially violated parity ( @xmath67 ) ( taking @xmath68 , equivalently , @xmath69 , without loss of generality ) , we have @xcite @xmath70 note , for @xmath71 , @xmath72 is essentially the same as the one conjectured in @xcite for scaling behavior of the spectral statistics .",

    "the cases with a slow variation of @xmath81 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 ( partial localization , partial time - reversal or parity - violation respectively ) and finite size @xmath9 correspond to a smooth variation of @xmath82 or @xmath83 between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "the semi - classical @xmath4-formulation is also numerically verified for the qkr - ensembles .",
    "this indicates an equivalence of the ensemble - averaging and the phase - space averaging for the statistical analysis .",
    "this further lends credence to the single parametric formulation of the statistical behavior of complex systems , irrespective of the origin of their complexity .",
    "however it needs to be examined for other dynamical systems .",
    "research has indicated a multi - parametric dependence of the spectral - statistics at long energy scales of the dynamical systems @xcite , originating in the level - density oscillations due to short periodic orbits . however , these studies are not at variance with our work .",
    "this is because the `` semi - classical '' @xmath4-derivation in @xcite is based on the assumed equivalence of the traces of the operators with their phase - space averages .",
    "the assumption may not be valid on short time - scales of the dynamics .",
    "one should also understand the exact role of the ensemble - averaging for the statistical analysis of dynamical systems .",
