    "in the last few years many high accuracy calculations have been made of cosmological consequences of nambu - goto ( ng ) cosmic strings @xcite .",

    "there are good reasons why most studies of the cosmological effects of topological defects ( see @xcite for a summary ) have concentrated on ng strings : these are the simplest type of cosmic string , and their equations of motion ( at least in minkowski space ) can be solved exactly . on a lattice",
    "one can use the highly efficient smith - vilenkin algorithm @xcite ; and in fact some of the recent predictions are based on minkowski space codes of ng network evolution @xcite .",
    "however ng cosmic strings , of which the simplest example are the strings formed in the abelian higgs model , are not likely to be the most realistic type of cosmic string .",
    "cosmic strings that can create significant density perturbations require gut scale physics .",
    "if the higgs field that forms the string couples to fermions in the gut theory  as might well be expected of a higgs field  then these fermions yield zero modes in the core of the string @xcite , thereby generating a current ( which need not be electromagnetically coupled ) along the string .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in chiral cosmic strings which arise naturally in supersymmetric ( susy ) theories @xcite , where a @xmath3 symmetry is broken with a fayet - iliopoulos d - term , resulting in a single fermion zero mode which travels in only one direction along the string  this defines a chiral string . in the cosmological context",
    ", chiral strings are automatically formed at the end of inflation in susy models with a d - term @xcite .",
    "furthermore the zero mode ( or chiral nature of the string ) survives the subsequent supersymmetry breaking phase transition @xcite , and consequently both inflation and chiral cosmic strings contribute to the density and cmbr perturbations in this scenario .",
    "calculations of these observable predictions were carried out recently @xcite , and there the @xmath4 s were decomposed as @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "however , we believe that the use of the @xmath4 from ng strings in the above formula is an oversimplification at least in the inflation plus chiral cosmic string scenario mentioned above . in the case of chiral cosmic strings ,",
    "the presence of the fermion zero mode is likely to have a significant effect on the dynamics of the string network , which could therefore evolve very differently to a ng network .",

    "we show in section [ sec : gauge ] that the physical reason for this stems from the conserved charge on chiral strings : if this charge is zero then @xmath10 and one is left with ng strings as required .    if the charge on the strings is maximal then @xmath11 . as we show in section [ sec : res",

    "it means that self - intersections ( which produce loops ) never occur .",
    "since this is an important mechanism of energy loss in the case of ng strings , this result already gives an indication that the evolution of chiral and ng cosmic string networks may be very different .",
    "for general chiral string solutions , self - intersection is certainly possible , but we may expect that the probability is lower than in the ng case . to quantify the differences between ng and chiral string evolution , we study in section [ sec : res ] the self - intersection probability of loops with different numbers of harmonics on them and different conserved charges .",

    "for pedagogical reasons , we here review briefly the work of carter and peter @xcite .",
    "the action for chiral cosmic strings they proposed involves a dimensionless scalar field @xmath14 which can be interpreted as the phase of the current carriers condensed on the string .",
    "the action is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the induced metric on the world sheet : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the background metric , with signature @xmath20 ( which in the following we shall take to be the minkowski metric ) and @xmath21 denotes the position of the string at world - sheet coordinates @xmath22 .",
    "the first term in ( [ baction ] ) is just the ng action for a string with tension @xmath23 .",
    "the action ( [ baction ] ) is invariant under reparametrizations , @xmath24 , and also under transformations of @xmath14 , with a compensating transformation of @xmath25 : @xmath26 these freedoms must be removed by making gauge choices , as discussed below .",
    "the dimensionless lagrange multiplier @xmath25 sets the constraint @xmath27 which ensures that the cosmic strings are indeed chiral .",
    "generally , current - carrying strings are characterized by two currents and their corresponding charges @xcite .",
    "one of these currents , proportional to @xmath28 , is conserved by virtue of the equations of motion ; the other , proportional to @xmath29 , is topologically conserved . however , for chiral strings , because of ( [ cpsi ] ) the two currents coincide , and so therefore do the two corresponding charges @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in minkowski space ,",

    "we shall verify this later in particular coordinate systems .    from ( [ currcon ] ) , we may provisionally define the current as @xmath36 , which is conserved and null , satisfying @xmath37 however , this expression is _ not _ invariant under the @xmath14 transformation ( [ phitrans ] ) .",
    "there is an ambiguity in the definition of @xmath38 : _ any _ current of the form @xmath39 is null and conserved ; there is an infinity of conservation laws .",
    "this is a peculiarity of null currents in 1 + 1 dimensions . for definiteness",

    "moreover , we can replace @xmath14 by any function of itself , provided we change @xmath25 to compensate as in ( [ phitrans ] ) .    for the ng string it is usual to choose the conformal gauge in which @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "explicitly , if we write @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and denote derivatives with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 by a dot and prime respectively , the conformal gauge is specified by two conditions : @xmath49 and @xmath50 this implies that the string s velocity is perpendicular to its tangent vector . for the ng string , because of the conformal invariance of the action , these two conditions are not in fact independent , and therefore do not fully specify the coordinates .",
    "we can in addition impose the temporal gauge condition @xmath51 for chiral strings , however , these three conditions are inconsistent , so different choices are needed .",
    "we first recall the choices made by martins and shellard ( ms ) @xcite , who studied a number of properties of chiral cosmic string loops .",
    "they opted to maintain the temporal gauge condition ( [ temporal ] ) .",

    "notice that this result is due to the gauge conditions we have chosen : with the gauge choice of ms , @xmath106 .    observe also that when @xmath107 , equation ( [ vectang ] ) implies that @xmath108 . since their velocity is always parallel to the tangent vector , these strings do not change their shapes , and thus never self - intersect .",
    "furthermore , given that when @xmath98 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , it follows that for @xmath98 @xmath111 thus the strings move at half the speed of light .",
    "recall from ( [ ndef ] ) that when @xmath98 the strings carry the maximal charge .",
    "we now turn to the properties of loops which must satisfy the periodicity conditions @xmath112 from ( [ vectang ] ) , this implies , in the centre - of - mass frame , @xmath113 it follows that , as in the ng case , the motion of chiral cosmic string loops is periodic , with period @xmath114 ( because @xmath115 ) . as noted above , for @xmath98 these loops",
    "do not self - intersect and hence are vorton solutions @xcite .",
    "the majority of studies of vortons to date have assumed that these are circular loops @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "the vortons with @xmath98 found here have entirely arbitrary shapes .    for arbitrary @xmath97",
    "it is possible to construct solutions of ( [ eqnstosolve ] ) just as in the case of ng strings .",
    "for example , a 1-harmonic loop solution with constant @xmath97 is given by @xmath116 this is a circular string oscillating between maximum and minimum radii of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "( such a solution was considered numerically in @xcite for arbitrary current carrying loops . )",
    "this loop never self - intersects for any value of @xmath97 .",
    "higher order harmonic solutions can also be constructed along very similar lines to references @xcite .    since loops with @xmath98 never self - intersect ,",
    "it is interesting to ask how the self - intersection probability of a loop with a given number of harmonics depends on @xmath97 ( or equivalently on the conserved charge @xmath31 given in ( [ ndef ] ) ) . for simplicity",
    ", we will study this question for @xmath119 = constant . in that case , @xmath31 is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the invariant length of the loop .",
    "we now show that self - intersecting loop solutions exist for @xmath122 through the construction of an explicitly self - intersecting loop .",
    "then the probabilities of self - intersection will be studied numerically for loops of a fixed invariant length @xmath121 but with different numbers of harmonics on them and different values of @xmath97 .",
    "the condition that a loop self - intersects at time @xmath123 is that there exists a solution of @xmath124 for some @xmath125 . to show that self - intersection is possible , consider the following solutions for @xmath126 and @xmath9 that satisfy ( [ eqnstosolve ] ) : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 have no common factors and @xmath130 is an arbitrary angle .",
    "now let @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "then the self intersection condition ( [ sisec ] ) becomes @xmath135 for which we must find solutions for @xmath136 . on substitution of ( [ trial ] ) , this condition becomes @xmath137 hence the requirement is that @xmath138 where @xmath139 must satisfy @xmath140 generically , there are solutions to equations ( [ si1])([si2 ] ) , and hence self - intersections .      more generally one can search for self - intersections numerically and try to determine the self - intersection probability as a function of @xmath97 and the number of harmonics on the loop .",
    "to do this , we used a modified version of the code written by siemens and kibble @xcite to search for self - intersections of ng loops .",
    "these authors built on work of brown and delaney @xcite who devised a method of generating odd harmonic series satisfying a given constraint in terms of products of rotations .",
    "the only difference between the ng and chiral cosmic string loops is that for the former , the constraint is @xmath141 whilst for the latter the constraint is @xmath142 .",
    "thus here we carry out a simple extension of the work of siemens and kibble to study the self - intersection properties of @xmath143 harmonic loops ( the notation means that there are @xmath144 harmonics in the solution of @xmath126 , and @xmath145 in the solution for @xmath9 . )    for more technical details on the code , the reader is referred to @xcite . in the results presented in figures [ string1]-[string3 ] below , the rotation angles were given a uniform distribution , with the number of points along the string chosen to be @xmath146 .",
    "this gives a resolution of 0.0104712 radians .",
    "the cutoff , below which self - intersection was not tested , was taken as 0.084 radians corresponding to 8 step lengths .",
    "these are the same parameters as those chosen in @xcite which have already been seen to work well .",
    "furthermore , decreasing @xmath147 or increasing the cutoff did not affect our results .",
    "the self - intersection probability was calculated for @xmath148 cosmic string loops as a function of @xmath97 ( which corresponds to different charges on the loop through ( [ ndef2 ] ) ) .",
    "figures  [ string1]-[string3 ] plot the intersection probability against @xmath149 for these @xmath148 harmonic loops .",
    "( error bars are one standard deviation . )",
    "notice that for @xmath98 the loops do not self - intersect as was already proved above , whereas for a relatively large range of @xmath97 the probability is the same as the ng ( @xmath150 ) case .",
    "thus charges on chiral cosmic string loops appear only to have a significant effect on the dynamics of the loops when these charges are large .",
    "indeed , if the loops are formed with large charges , they will scarcely ever intersect and this will lead to a cosmological catastrophe since the loops ( vortons ) will dominate the energy density of the universe . it therefore remains to understand whether or not these charges are expected to be large or small when the loops form : we leave a discussion of this question to the conclusions .    finally , we note that while the plots show results for @xmath148 harmonic strings , we also ran the code for strings with different numbers of left and right - moving harmonics .",
    "this did not substantially change the intersection probability from that of a @xmath148 harmonic string if the harmonics were both close to @xmath144 .",
    "the basis for this paper was the action ( [ baction ] ) for chiral cosmic strings first proposed in @xcite .",
    "this is a well defined , unique , action for strings carrying massless zero - modes which travel in one direction along the string at the speed of light . in section [ sec :",
    "gauge ] we reproduced the results of @xcite showing how , with suitable gauge choices and treatment of the lagrange multiplier @xmath25 , the resulting equations of motion are integrable and reduce to the familiar wave equation with two constraints ( [ eqnstosolve ] ) .",
    "these two constraints are that @xmath102 and @xmath151 .",
    "we noted that the reason why @xmath152 lies within the kibble - turok sphere rather than on it is that the chiral strings carry a conserved charge ( associated with the current on them ) . in the limit of zero charge",
    ", the equations of motion and constraints ( [ eqnstosolve ] ) reduce to those of ng strings in the conformal - temporal gauge as required .",
    "we placed a certain emphasis on gauge choices in section [ sec : gauge ] since , as we showed in that section , the same action with less appropriate gauge choices can lead to much more complicated equations of motion which are not readily integrable , as for the equations of motion ( [ mseqs ] ) derived in @xcite .    in section",
    "[ sec : res ] we showed that chiral current - carrying cosmic strings can not have cusps on them . since cosmic rays are predominantly produced at cusps on ng strings @xcite , it is likely that a network of chiral cosmic strings will produce fewer cosmic rays .",
    "we also showed that when the charge on the string is maximal ( equivalently @xmath98 ) , @xmath12 so that the strings move along themselves at half the speed of light and never self - intersect . in the case of loops",
    "these correspond to stationary vorton solutions of arbitrary shape . for infinite strings",
    "it means that these can never self - intersect to form loops ( at least in minkowski space ) .",
    "since this is the main mechanism for removing energy from ng string networks , these results suggest that networks of chiral cosmic strings may evolve very differently from ng cosmic string networks .    in another step to study the evolution of chiral cosmic string networks , we considered the self - intersection probability of loops with @xmath153 and different numbers of harmonics ( section [ sec : res ] ) .",
    "the results show that only when the charge on the loop is relatively large does the self - intersection probability differ significantly from the ng one .    as a result of this work ,",
    "we are left with a number of important questions to study in the future .",
    "maybe the most significant one of these is to understand what initial value of @xmath97 might be expected for the loops and infinite strings formed at the phase transition ( which could be , say , at the end of inflation as discussed in the introduction ) . if @xmath97 is initially very small ( i.e.  the charge on the strings is initially close to being maximal ) then chiral cosmic strings are already ruled out , as is the mixed scenario of d - term inflation and strings @xcite .",
    "the reason is that if the chiral cosmic strings effectively never self - intersect they rapidly come to dominate the energy density of the universe . indeed , since the fermions are traveling in one direction only in the chiral case , the current and corresponding charge are larger than in the non - chiral case .",
    "consequently , we would expect the charge to be close to maximal and hence @xmath97 to be small when the fermion zero modes condense on the string at formation .",
    "if however , the zero modes are formed at a subsequent phase transition , then @xmath97 is likely to be closer to unity .",
    "indeed , this is the assumption made in @xcite , where theories giving rise to chiral cosmic strings were constrained by the requirement that they should not over produce vortons .",
    "we have arguments suggesting that @xmath97 is in fact initially small ; these will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we have restricted attention to loops in which @xmath97 is constant , but in fact one should also examine the more general case where @xmath97 is a function of @xmath14 , though always restricted to the range @xmath154 .",
    "another objective would be to try to solve equations ( [ eqnstosolve ] ) in a very similar way to the smith - vilenkin algorithm which is an exact numerical algorithm for solving the corresponding equations for ng strings in minkowski space .",
    "however , the smith - vilenkin algorithm is no longer exact for the chiral string equations : because of the constraint @xmath155 , the vertices will generally not remain on the lattice as the system evolves .",
    "indeed we believe that there is no value of @xmath97 for which the algorithm can be made to work  except perhaps @xmath98 , a case that is uninteresting in this context as we already know that there the strings are effectively stationary .",
    "finally , one should also consider to what degree the effects of friction on the evolving chiral cosmic string network are important .",
    "frictional effects on ng and chiral strings are likely to be similar since there are no long range forces in either case ; this is unlike the situation for electromagnetically coupled strings @xcite .",
    "ultimately the effect of expansion should be incorporated too , though as in the ng case many predictions can be made from minkowski space results @xcite .",
    "we are currently studying a number of these questions @xcite .",
    "our general conclusion of this paper would be , however , that we have found evidence to suggest that chiral cosmic string networks evolve very differently from ng networks .",
    "hence their cosmological consequences will be very different , and so some caution should be used before simply adding the effects of inflation and ng strings as in @xcite , especially when the specific model under consideration actually produces chiral cosmic strings .",
