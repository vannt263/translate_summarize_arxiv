    "the optical properties of small structures have fascinated scientists for a long time . in 1857 , michael faraday studied the interaction of light with colloidal metals @xcite and in 1871 lord rayleigh presented an analytical analysis of light scattering from small spherical particles @xcite .",
    "a full analytical analysis of spherical particles can be made using the lorenz - mie scattering theory @xcite .",
    "light scattering of a normal incidence plane wave by a small cylinder was addressed by lord rayleigh in 1918 @xcite and extended to oblique incidence by j. r. wait in 1955 @xcite . since then the problem of light scattering from small particles and cylinders",
    "has been revisited many times and is today well understood @xcite .",
    "due to the recent progress in the development of nanotechnologies , which has enabled fabrication of structures on the scale of a few nanometers , the interest in the optical properties of such structures is today enormous .",
    "in particular , metal nanostructures are intensively studied because they allow for resonant excitation of localized surface plasmons @xcite , i.e. collective excitations of the free conduction electrons that are resonantly coupled to the electromagnetic field . both metal nanowires and -particles",
    "have several interesting applications as optical antennas @xcite , within photovoltaics @xcite , and many others ( see e.g. ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "optimal design and fabrication of metal nanostructures for applications rely on accurate numerical simulations and theoretical predictions .",
    "full numerical solution of the maxwell equations for metal nanostructures is a demanding and time - consuming computational task .",
    "the huge field - gradients near e.g. metal corners require a very fine meshing in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "thus , for these cases , accurate analytical models that predict the optical properties are very important , both for applications and as benchmarks for numerical methods .    in the present work ,",
    "we analytically calculate the polarizability and the plasmon resonances of a geometry , which we name `` the partly buried double half - cylinder '' .",
    "the geometry is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig1:structure3d ] .",
    "it consists of a double half - cylinder ( a pair of conjoined half - cylinders ) with optical properties described by the dielectric constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the double half - cylinder is placed in two semi - infinite half - spaces with optical properties given by the dielectric constants @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the simpler case of a half - cylinder @xcite or a double half - cylinder in a _ homogenous _ surrounding has , to some extent , been analyzed before @xcite .",
    "also , a double half - sphere consisting of two joint hemispheres with different dielectric constants has been studied @xcite . however , for this three dimensional problem no closed - form analytical solution was found @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two conjoined half - cylinders were analyzed using kelvin inversion and mellin transforms yielding a solution for the potential , however , only for a special resonant case where the two dielectric constants are of similar magnitude and opposite sign . using the bipolar coordinate system @xcite ,",
    "cosine- and sine - transformations , a more general analysis of the double half - cylinder has recently been presented by pitkonen @xcite . to some extent ,",
    "our analysis follows the lines of pitkonen , in that we use bipolar coordinates , as well as cosine- and sine - transformations . however , we consider a much more general geometry c.f . fig .  [ fig1:structure3d ] .",
    "our approach e.g. enables analysis of a nanowire with the shape of a half - cylinder supported by a substrate .",
    "this is important because nanowires are often supported by a substrate and usually have cross - sectional shapes approximating half - circles .",
    "compared to pitkonen we also obtain much more compact expressions for the polarizabilities , i.e. we avoid using polylogarithms as after reduction , only the natural logarithm is needed .",
    "finally , we also analyze the plasmon resonances of the more general geometry in detail .",
    "we start our analysis by assuming that the dielectric constants are linear , isotropic , homogenous , and frequency dependent . to simplify the notation ,",
    "the frequency dependence of dielectric constant @xmath4 is implicitly assumed .",
    "we also assume that the cross section of the double half - cylinder is small compared to the wavelength , i.e. we take an electrostatic approach . in a static theory , @xmath5 and the electrostatic field can be expressed by means of the electrostatic potential @xmath6 . in each domain ,",
    "the electrostatic potential must fulfill laplace s equation @xmath7 , with the boundary conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 on _ s _ , where the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the different domains ( 1,2,3 , and 4 ) and @xmath12 to the boundaries .",
    "the first step of our analysis is to switch to bipolar coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , which are connected to rectangular coordinates via @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the four different regions in the @xmath17 plane are given as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21.,width=226 ]    first we consider the case where the incident field is polarized along the @xmath22 axis .",
    "such a field will induce a vertically oriented dipole moment in the double half - cylinder .",
    "thus , we look for solutions that are even functions of @xmath23 and , hence , @xmath13 . for a unit amplitude incident field",

    "( [ eq : alpha_v_final ] ) the resonance condition can be identified as @xmath37 for ordinary dielectric surroundings @xmath38 , the resonance condition can only be fulfilled if the dielectric constant of the partly buried double half - cylinder is negative e.g. if the cylinder is made of a free electron - like metal as silver or gold . in this case , the resonances are dipole surface plasmon modes that arise due to the interaction of the free conduction electrons in the metal cylinder with the time - dependent incident field .",

    "in figs . [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] , and [ fig5 ] , we illustrate the polarizability for three important geometries . in order to easily identify the plasmon resonances ,",
    "we first calculate the polarizability as a function of the real part @xmath39 of the dielectric constant of the cylinder ( or half - cylinder ) with a fixed small imaginary part as @xmath40 . as we are interested in the plasmon response of the system we consider negative @xmath39 .",
    "first we consider the geometry of a half - cylinder in a homogenous surrounding with @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .     of a half - cylinder with @xmath42 in a surrounding medium described by @xmath43.,width=264 ]",
    "the result shows that both the real and the imaginary part of the vertical polarizability display a resonant behavior at @xmath44 . such a resonance is commonly referred to as a dipole surface plasmon resonance @xcite .",
    "notice how the imaginary part of the polarizability is always positive as it should be for ordinary lossy materials .",
    "this is contrary to the numerical results presented by pitkonen @xcite , which display strange negative imaginary parts of the polarizability .",
    "note also how the real part of the polarizability changes sign across the plasmon resonance .",
    "for horizontally induced dipole moments the surface plasmon resonance of the metallic half - cylinder is located at @xmath45 .",
    "this plasmon resonance is clearly visible in both real and imaginary parts of the polarizability .    the second geometry that we consider is a half - cylinder supported by a substrate ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "such a configuration is of particular interest in relation to experimental work .",
    "firstly , because nanowires are usually supported by substrates and , secondly , because nanowires often have cross sectional shapes similar to half - circles . here , we consider the case of an air ( @xmath46 ) superstrate and quartz ( @xmath47 ) substrate .     of a half - cylinder laying on a substrate .",
    "the dielectric constants of the half - cylinder , the substrate , and the superstrate are @xmath42 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively.,width=264 ]    for vertical polarization the configuration has a surface plasmon resonance at @xmath50 . this resonance is clearly seen in both real and imaginary parts of the polarizability . for the horizontal case",
    "the surface plasmon resonance is located at @xmath51 .",
    "note that when compared to the half - cylinder in air ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , the plasmon resonances shift significantly , in particular , for the case of a horizontally polarized driving field .",
    "this is an important finding because it underlines the fact that the substrate plays a crucial role when the spectral location of the plasmon resonances of metallic nanostructures are established .    the third geometry that we consider is a full cylinder ( @xmath52 ) partly buried in a quartz substrate ( @xmath53 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the polarizability is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .     of a partly buried cylinder with @xmath54 .",
    "the dielectric constants of the sub- and superstrate are @xmath53 and @xmath55 , respectively.,width=264 ]    for the case of vertical polarization this configuration has a dipole plasmon resonance at @xmath56 . for horizontal polarization",
    "the plasmon resonance is located at @xmath57 . for this geometry",
    "the polarizability is more complicated .",
    "three peaks in both the real and the imaginary part of the polarizability can be identified from the figure , resulting in a large polarizability over a wide range of @xmath39 .",
    "next , we have calculated the polarizability as a function of wavelength for the same three geometries in the case of silver in air or on quartz . the data for the dielectric constant of silver is taken from the experiments of johnson and christy @xcite .",
    "for the half - cylinder the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( a ) .        the horizontal polarizability displays a clear resonance around 370  nm .",
    "this corresponds nicely to the wavelength where the real part of the dielectric constant of silver equals @xmath58 .",
    "the vertical response shows a resonance at approximately 330  nm , which is where the real part of the dielectric constant of silver is @xmath59 . for a half - cylinder supported by a quartz ( @xmath60 ) substrate the polarizability",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( b ) .",
    "note how the resonance in the horizontal polarizability has red - shifted approximately 50 nm due to the presence of the quartz substrate .",
    "the resonance wavelength is now close to 420  nm , which is where the real part of the dielectric constant of silver is approximately @xmath61 .",
    "when compared to the half - cylinder in homogenous space , the vertical resonance of the half - cylinder on quartz does not red - shift significantly .",
    "the explanation for the larger red - shift seen in the horizontal polarizability is that a larger part of the field is within the substrate for a horizontal dipole moment than for a vertical one .",
    "for the partly buried cylinder the polarizabilities as a function of wavelength are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ]  ( c ) .",
    "the result shows that the resonances in the vertical and the horizontal polarizabilities are similar to each other .",
    "this might be expected because for both polarizations approximately half of the plasmon field will be within the substrate .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented an analytical study of the electrostatic polarizability of a general geometry consisting of two conjoined half - cylinders embedded in a reference structure of two semi - infinite half - spaces .",
    "the analysis is performed using bipolar coordinates , cosine- , and sine - transformations and closed - form expressions for the polarizabilities are presented for both polarizations using elementary functions . for cylinders ( or half - cylinders ) with negative dielectric constant the resonance criterion for the surface plasmon resonance is examined and several special cases of the general geometry are considered .",
    "the present results provide analytical predictions of plasmon resonances of several important structures within nanowire plasmonics .",
    "the vertical polarizability @xmath30 of the partly buried double half - cylinder is obtained by comparing the far - field expression of the scattered potential on the @xmath22 axis with the scattered potential from a line dipole @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the induced dipole moment with the constant incident electric field @xmath64 . on the @xmath22 axis @xmath65 and ,",
    "hence , @xmath66 , thus we find @xmath67 , which in the far field should be large @xmath68 .",
    "this means that @xmath69 . in this limit ,",
    "we taylor expand the sine and cosine functions to find @xmath70 . using @xmath71 and @xmath72 we find the scattered far - field potential on the @xmath22 axis as @xmath73 where the last integral just is a constant contribution to the potential .",
