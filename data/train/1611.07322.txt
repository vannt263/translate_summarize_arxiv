    "all quantum systems inevitably interact with the surrounding environment . in general , the access to that interaction is highly limited , because of a plethora of uncontrolled degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the theory of open quantum systems ( oqs ) @xcite is exploited to look at the reduced dynamics of the total system and investigate the subsystem of interest .",
    "the dynamics of oqs takes into account the influence of the environment and encodes it in completely positive and trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps that are usually expressed by the kraus representation @xmath0 where @xmath1 are kraus operators @xcite .",
    "an appropriate knowledge of the dynamical maps gives insights into the methods of controlling and preserving fragile quantum features such as coherences and entanglement , which are a major ingredient of modern quantum technologies .",
    "the standard approach to oqs dynamics is based on local - in - time master equation @xmath2 with @xmath3 being a time - dependent generator of a cptp map @xmath4 .",
    "if the generator is time - independent , it yields a markovian semigroup dynamics @xmath5 moreover , to have a cptp map , the generator has to be of the celebrated gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad ( gksl ) form @xcite @xmath6+\\sum_k { \\gamma}_k\\big(v_k\\rho v_k^\\dag-\\frac{1}{2}\\{v_k^\\dag v_k,\\rho\\}\\big),\\quad h = h^\\dag,\\quad { \\gamma}_k\\ge0.\\ ] ] the semigroup approach to oqs was the first step for investigation of markovian and non - markovian dynamics in the quantum regime . nowadays , these fundamental concepts are at the core of interest , because of its vast applications , especially in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the classical theory of stochastic processes , in the quantum case , the definitions of ( non-)markovianity are not unique and several not necessary equivalent approaches exist in the literature ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the two most popular are the one based on the distinguishability of the quantum states @xcite and on the cp - divisibility of the dynamical map @xcite , recently extended to the whole hierarchy of @xmath7-divisible maps in @xcite ( for other definitions of markovianity see also @xcite ) . in this manuscript",
    ", we use the cp - divisiblity as a definition of ( non-)markovianity , which is more restrictive than the one based on the state distinguishability .",
    "the evolution given by a dynamical map @xmath4 is markovian if and only if it can be represented as @xmath8 @xmath9 with @xmath10 being completely positive ( cp ) .",
    "this type of dynamics is called cp - divisible and we can always express @xmath11 provided @xmath12 exists . in principle , finding the inverse of a dynamical map is challenging .",
    "therefore we propose a method based on the transfer matrix approach , that helps us to decide whether @xmath10 is cp or not .    in this research",
    "we also address the following question .",
    "how robust ( fragile ) is markovian dynamics while changing ( time - independent ) kraus operators and keeping time factors fixed ?",
    "we investigate the model based on a qubit random unitary dynamics @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 are pauli matrices ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 is a probability distribution ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) .",
    "equation ( [ map ] ) is generated by a time - local generator @xmath20 we say that for each @xmath21 the corresponding @xmath7-th channel is active .    first , we the fix time - dependent probability distribution and expose the kraus operators @xmath14 to the noise ( perturb them ) .",
    "having defined the probability distribution @xmath22 such that it stems from markovian dynamics ( semigroup and cp - divisible ) , we look at the markovian character of the perturbed dynamics , whether it was preserved or lost .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we elaborate on the model of noisy dynamics .",
    "then we introduce the transfer matrix notation and present an algorithm for checking markovianity of a dynamical map .",
    "next , we discuss the numerical results of perturbed dynamics . in the last section , we summerize our results and leave some questions for the further investigation .",
    "the first case we investigate is based on the markovian semigroup of single dephasing channel that is @xmath23 for @xmath24 @xmath4 is cptp and defines markovian semigroup property . here",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ ideal ] ) the ideal semigroup equation , because the kraus operators @xmath14 are not perturbed . however , in real - life experiments quantum systems are subjected to the additional , not - known noise .",
    "this noise , may stem from non - ideal preparation of laboratory equipment such as : mirrors , wave - plates , fibre - optics or detectors .",
    "therefore , we modify eq .",
    "( [ ideal ] ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) are non - ideal pauli spin matrices ( i.e. with an additional noise ) . ] and they are of the following form @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 one recovers the standard pauli matrices .",
    "it seems natural to introduce the noise in the exponents , because it corresponds to a non - ideal equipment .",
    "for example , one may interpret @xmath31 as an operator changing the polarisation of a photon by @xmath32 , then @xmath33 is an operator that changes polarisation by angle @xmath34 ( the real laboratory mirrors have @xmath35 , with small perturbation @xmath36 ) . here , we investigate markovianity ( in terms of divisibility and semigroup ) for the generic angles @xmath37 and @xmath38 in @xmath39 of our noisy dynamics ( [ noisy ] ) .",
    "further we check the robustness of markovianity for more general dynamical maps that are governed by the random unitary dynamics @xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 for unperturbed kraus operators ( i.e. @xmath42 ) eqs .",
    "( [ p0]-[p3 ] ) define semigroup dynamics .",
    "each non - zero @xmath43 corresponds to an active dephasing channel .    in our model",
    "we perturb only pauli matrices , treating them as non - ideal laboratory equipment while keeping the probability distribution corresponding to markovian semigroup fixed and check the markovian ( semigroup ) character of the map .",
    "all our considerations are based on the numerical analysis .",
    "the transfer matrix approach to quantum dynamics is equivalent to the dynamical map approach and carries all information about the evolution of oqs , including the influence of the environment on the system of interest .",
    "it is mostly used in quantum channels description @xcite and geometrical approach to markovianity of oqs @xcite .    for a set of @xmath44-dimensional orthonormal operators in the hilbert space @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) we may construct the transfer matrix that is isomorphic with a dynamical map @xmath4 @xmath47 therefore , one represents the map @xmath4 as @xmath48 if one chooses _ unit matrices _ as a basis , i.e. @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 ) then the transfer matrix @xmath51 relates to the choi matrix @xcite @xmath52 associated with the map @xmath4 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being maximally entangled state ) .",
    "a dynamical map @xmath4 is cptp if and only if the corresponding choi matrix @xmath52 is positive and @xmath56 .",
    "the advantage of using the @xmath57-matrix is that one may easily calculate relevant features of the dynamical map , in particular , divisibility of a map ( i.e. markovianity ) .",
    "it is easy to verify that a concatenation of two maps @xmath58 and @xmath59 results in ordinary matrix multiplication of the corresponding transfer matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , if the transfer matrix @xmath62 that is associated with a propagator @xmath10 ( @xmath8 ) yields positive choi matrix @xmath63 for all @xmath64 then @xmath4 is markovian ( i.e. @xmath10 is cp and thus @xmath4 is cp - divisible ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that @xmath65 , provided that @xmath51 is invertible for all @xmath19 .",
    "to decide whether a given map @xmath4 is markovian or not , we use the transfer matrix algorithm that reads as follows    1 .   construct the transfer matrix @xmath51 associated with @xmath4 ( use the _ unit matrices _ as a basis ) .",

    "calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath63 .",
    "markovian ( cp - divisible ) evolution is for all positive eigenvalues of @xmath63 , if at least one is negative , then @xmath4 is non - markovian .",
    "this algorithm is applicable for both analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "however , the complexity is directly associated with the complexity of evaluating eigenvalues of an @xmath69 matrix , which for larger systems may be challenging .",
    "let us consider the noisy single dephasing channel ( [ noisy ] ) .",
    "we apply the transfer matrix algorithm and use the numerical analysis for checking the markovianity of @xmath4 .",
    "the parameters are selected as follow    * @xmath70 $ ] - quantifying the noise in the kraus operators ( angles ) , * @xmath71 $ ] - decoherence rates for a markovian semigroup dynamics , * @xmath72 $ ] - time steps ( @xmath73.$ ] we choose time interval @xmath74s$ ] , while for rest we keep time up to 5s .",
    "we claim that this is sufficient for our purposes since all time - dependent probabilities exhibit exponential decay and larger times become negligible .",
    "this strong exponential dependance may be observed in the plots of eigenvalues . ]",
    "we perform the calculations for 100 choices of parameter @xmath43 , for which we form 1000 different noise kraus operators and evaluate for each of them 5000 time steps ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "we observed that within numerical precision ( @xmath76 ) the markovianity of @xmath4 is preserved , while the semigroup property is lost .",
    "this suggests that the semigroup property is extremely fragile for adding uncontrolled perturbation ( in our case perturbations in kraus operators ) . on the other hand",
