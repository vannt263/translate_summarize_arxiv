    "we denote by @xmath3 the scalar curvature and by @xmath4 the volume form for each riemannian metric @xmath5 .",
    "then the ( normalized ) einstein - hilbert functional @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 the classical yamabe problem is to find a metric @xmath8 in a given conformal class @xmath9 such that the einstein - hilbert functional attains its minimum on @xmath9 : @xmath10 .",
    "this minimizing metric @xmath8 is called a yamabe metric , and the conformal invariant @xmath11 the yamabe constant .",
    "it is a celebrated result in conformal geometry that the yamabe problem has an affirmative solution for closed manifolds .",
    "this was proven in a series of papers starting with the work of yamabe @xcite .",
    "although yamabe s proof overlooked the fundamental analytic difficulty concerning sobolev inequalities with a critical exponent , the general strategy in @xcite was correct .",
    "this difficulty is a profound one , and the proof was ultimately only corrected in stages , first by trudinger @xcite , then by aubin @xcite , and was finally completed by schoen @xcite .",
    "text - book style proofs are now available in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second case when the yamabe problem has a positive solution is when a manifold @xmath0 has a non - empty boundary . in this case , the einstein - hilbert functional has to be restricted to metrics ( and corresponding conformal subclasses ) with a minimal boundary condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting yamabe problem was solved by cherrier @xcite and escobar @xcite under some mild restrictions .    *",
    "yamabe problem for open manifolds .",
    "* in the case of open manifolds , it is important to clarify what is a _ suitable version of the yamabe problem _ which would capture the geometry of their ends .",
    "one reasonable version of the yamabe problem is to find a _ complete metric of constant scalar curvature in a given conformal class_. in this case , however , the concept of a minimizing yamabe metric does not make sense , and there are serious difficulties in this area",
    ". indeed , there are simple noncompact riemannian manifolds @xmath12 for which there does not exist _ any complete metric ( conformal to @xmath13 ) of constant scalar curvature _ , ( cf .",
    "hence one needs to place some geometric restriction ( e.g. curvature or injectivity radius bounds ) near each end of a noncompact manifold in order to establish the existence of a metric of constant scalar curvature .",
    "a more specific version of the yamabe problem for open manifolds is the _ singular yamabe problem _ ,",
    "i.e. when an open manifold @xmath14 is a complement @xmath15 of a submanifold @xmath16 of a closed riemannian manifold @xmath17",
    ". then the singular yamabe problem is to find a complete metric @xmath18 that is conformal to @xmath19 on @xmath20 and has constant scalar curvature , see @xcite , @xcite for earlier results and also @xcite for a survey of results in this area . here again the concept of a minimizing yamabe metric is not well - defined .    *",
    "cylindrical manifolds . * in this paper , we consider a particular class of open manifolds , which we call _ cylindrical manifolds_. these are open manifolds with _ tame ends _ equipped with a _ cylindrical metric _ on each end .",
    "cylindrical manifolds are well - known objects in geometry and topology .",
    "first of all , these manifolds are well - suited for the dirac operator on complete manifolds , as was shown first by gromov and lawson in @xcite .",
    "secondly , these objects are well known in gauge theory , where cylindrical manifolds have been thoroughly studied , see for example the books @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we remark that @xmath21-manifolds ( as geometric objects ) can be thought of as cylindrical manifolds with @xmath22 identical cylindrical ends ( see @xcite for results on the existence of positive scalar curvature on @xmath21-manifolds ) .",
    "there are several other constructions in geometry where cylindrical manifolds show up as natural _",
    "limit manifolds_. the first example comes from the work describing the process of _ bubbling out of einstein manifolds _ , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "it is known that for a sequence of einstein manifolds @xmath23 ( with some natural restrictions on their geometry ) there exists a subsequence @xmath24 which converges ( in the gromov - hausdorff topology ) to a compact _ einstein orbifold _",
    "@xmath25 with a finite set of singular points .",
    "let @xmath26 be an open neighborhood of a singular point @xmath27 .",
    "then the tangent cone of @xmath28 at @xmath29 is conformally cylindrical , although @xmath28 itself need not be .",
    "thus a cylindrical manifold ( with an appropriate conformal metric ) can be thought of as a _ linear approximation _ of the einstein orbifold @xmath25 ( see @xcite for the relation of this approximation to the yamabe invariant of orbifolds ) .",
    "the second example is related to the yamabe invariant @xmath30 of a compact manifold @xmath0 , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it was shown that @xmath31 , i.e. there exists a sequence of conformal classes @xmath32 and yamabe metrics @xmath33 such that the limit @xmath34 .",
    "the sequence of riemannian manifolds @xmath35 converges to the standard sphere @xmath36 identified with two antipodal points , see @xcite , @xcite . after deleting the singular point ,",
    "the punctured sphere is conformally equivalent to the canonical cylindrical manifold @xmath37 . in the general case of a closed manifold @xmath0 with positive yamabe invariant",
