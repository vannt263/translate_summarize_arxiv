    "while recent cosmological observations provide convincing evidence that nonbaryonic dark matter exists @xcite , we do not know the detailed particle properties of the dark matter , nor the particle spectrum of the dark sector .",
    "there has been considerable phenomenological effort towards placing model - independent limits on the possible interactions of the lightest dark - matter particle ( ldp ) in an attempt to try and identify candidates within detailed particle theories or rule out particular candidate theories .",
    "for instance , models with stable charged dark matter have been ruled out @xcite , while significant constraints have been made to dark - matter models with strong interactions @xcite , self - interactions @xcite , and a millicharge @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that a neutral dark - matter particle with a relatively large electric or magnetic dipole moment remains a phenomenologically viable candidate @xcite .",
    "concurrent with this phenomenological effort , theorists have taken to considering physics beyond the standard model in search of a consistent framework for viable dark - matter candidates .",
    "the leading candidates , those that produce the correct relic abundance and appear in minimal extensions of the standard model ( often for independent reasons ) , are the axion  @xcite and weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , such as the neutralino , the lightest mass eigenstate from the superposition of the supersymmetric partners of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 neutral gauge bosons and of the neutral higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "however , other viable candidates have also been considered recently , such as gravitinos or kaluza - klein gravitons produced through the late decay of wimps @xcite .",
    "these latter candidates are an interesting possibility because the constraints to the interactions of the ldp do not apply to the next - to - lightest dark - matter particle ( nldp ) , and the decay of the nldp to the ldp at early times may produce interesting cosmological effects ; for instance , the reprocessing of the light - element abundances formed during big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , or if the nldp is charged , the suppression of the matter power spectrum on small scales and thus a reduction in the expected number of dwarf galaxies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe another effect charged nldps could have on the matter power spectrum . if all of the present - day dark matter is produced through the late decay of charged nldps , then , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effect is to essentially cut off the matter power spectrum on scales that enter the horizon before the nldp decays .",
    "however , if only a fraction @xmath6 of the present - day dark matter is produced through the late decay of charged nldps , the matter power spectrum is suppressed on small scales only by a factor @xmath7 .",
    "this induces a scale - dependent spectral index for wavenumbers that enter the horizon when the age of the universe is equal to the lifetime of the charged particles .",
    "what we show below is that , for certain combinations of @xmath6 and of the lifetime of the charged particle @xmath8 , this suppression modifies the nonlinear power spectrum in a way similar ( but different in detail ) to the effect of a constant @xmath9 .",
    "although these effects are different , constraints based on observations that probe the nonlinear power spectrum at redshifts of 2 to 4 , such as measurements of the lyman-@xmath1 forest , might confuse a running index with the effect we describe here even if parametrized in terms of a constant @xmath10 .",
    "this has significant implications for the interpretation of the detection of a large running of the spectral index as a constraint on simple single - field inflationary models .",
    "the detection of a unexpectedly large spectral running in future observations could instead be revealing properties of the dark - matter particle spectrum in conjunction with a more conventional model of inflation .",
    "we note that the sloan digital sky survey lyman-@xmath1 data @xcite has significantly improved the limits to constant-@xmath10 models compared to previous measurements alone @xcite",
    ". a detailed study of the ( @xmath8,@xmath6 ) parameter space using these and other cosmological data would also provide interesting limits to the models we discuss here .    while , even with future lyman-@xmath1 data , it may be difficult to discriminate the effect of a constant running of the spectral index from a scale - dependent spectral index due to a charged nldp",
    ", other observations may nevertheless discriminate between the two scenarios .",
    "future measurements of the power spectrum of neutral hydrogen through the 21cm - line might probe the linear matter power spectrum in exquisite detail over the redshift range @xmath11 at comoving scales less than 1 mpc and perhaps as small as @xmath12 mpc @xcite ; such a measurement could distinguish between the charged - particle decay scenario we describe here and other modifications to the primoridal power spectrum .",
    "if , as in some models we discuss below , the mass of these particles is in reach of future particle colliders the signature of this scenario would be spectacular and unmistakable  the production of very long - lived charged particles that slowly decay to stable dark matter .",
    "although we describe the cosmological side of our calculations in a model - independent manner , remarkably , there are configurations in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with the right properties for the effect we discuss here .",
    "in particular , we find that if the lsp is a neutralino quasi - degenerate in mass with the lightest stau , we can naturally obtain , at the same time , ldps providing the correct dark matter abundance @xmath13 @xcite and nldps with the long lifetimes and the sizable densities in the early universe needed in the proposed scenario .",
    "such configurations arise even in minimal supersymmetric schemes , such as the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario  @xcite and the minimal anomaly - mediated supersymmetry - breaking ( mamsb ) model  @xcite .",
    "this implies that a detailed study of the ( @xmath8,@xmath6 ) parameter space using current and future cosmological data may constrain regions of the mssm parameter space that are otherwise viable .",
    "furthermore , we are able to make quantitative statements about testing the scenario we propose in future particle colliders or dark matter detection experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first review in section  [ sec : charged ] how the standard calculation of linear perturbations in an expanding universe must be modified to account for the effects of a decaying charged species , calculate the linear matter power spectrum and discuss the constraints to this model from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . in section",
    "[ sec : nonlinear ] we briefly discuss how we estimate the nonlinear power spectrum from the linear power spectrum and present several examples . in section  [ sec:21 cm ]",
    "we discuss how measurements of the angular power spectra of the primordial 21-cm radiation can be used to distinguish this effect from other modifications to the primordial power spectrum . in section  [ sec : partmodel ] we describe how this scenario can be embedded in a particle physics model , concluding that the most appealing scheme is one where long lifetimes are obtained by considering nearly degenerate ldp and nldp masses . in section  [ sec : lifetimes ] we compute the lifetimes of charged next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsps ) decaying into neutralino lsps , and show that , in the mssm , the role of a nldp with a long lifetime can be played by a stau only . in section  [ sec : fraction ] we estimate what fraction of charged to neutral dark matter is expected in this case , while in section  [ sec : msugra ] we describe how consistent realizations of this scenario can be found within the parameter space of msugra and mamsb .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : colliders ] we discuss the expected signatures of this scenario at future particle colliders , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and prospects for detection in experiments searching for wimp dark matter .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary of our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we discuss how the decay of a charged particle @xmath14 ( the nldp ) to a neutral particle @xmath15 ( the ldp ) results in the suppression of the linear matter power spectrum on small scales .",
    "as the @xmath14 particles decay to @xmath15 particles , their comoving energy density decays exponentially as @xmath16 increasing the comoving energy density of @xmath15 particles as @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the comoving number density of dark matter , and @xmath19 is the comoving number density of dark matter produced through the decay of @xmath14 particles , @xmath20 is the scale factor , and @xmath21 is the cosmic time .",
    "since the @xmath14 particles are charged , they are tightly coupled to the ordinary baryons ( the protons , helium nuclei , and electrons ) through coulomb scattering .",
    "it is therefore possible describe the combined @xmath14 and baryon fluids as a generalized baryon - like component @xmath22 as far as perturbation dynamics is concerned .",
    "we thus denote by @xmath23 the total charged - particle energy density at any given time . at late times , after nearly all @xmath14 particles have decayed , @xmath24 .",
    "the relevant species whose perturbation dynamics are modified from the standard case are the stable dark matter ( subscript @xmath15 ) , the charged species ( subscript @xmath22 ) , and the photons ( subscript @xmath25 ) . by imposing covariant conservation of the total stress - energy tensor , accounting for the compton scattering between the electrons and the photons , and linearizing about a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe",
    "we arrive at the equations describing the evolution of linear fluid perturbations of these components in an expanding universe .    in the synchronous gauge , for the ` @xmath22 ' component ,",
    "the perturbation evolution equations are @xmath26 and @xmath27 here and in what follows , @xmath28 is the fractional overdensity and @xmath29 is the divergence of the bulk velocity in fourier space of a given species @xmath30 .",
    "an overdot represents a derivative with respect to the conformal time .",
    "the number density of electrons is @xmath31 , while @xmath32 is the thomson cross section .",
    "because the @xmath14 particles and the baryons share a common bulk velocity and overdensity , will generally evolve away from zero in an arbitrary gauge , even when starting with the adiabatic initial condition @xmath33 , due to gradients in the proper time .",
    "it is a special simplifying property of the synchronous gauge that @xmath34 = 0 for all time for adiabatic initial conditions . ]",
    "these equations are identical to the standard perturbation equations for the baryons with the replacement @xmath35 ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the dark matter",
    "we find that @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the modifications to the photon perturbation evolution are negligibly small because @xmath14 decays during the radiation - dominated epoch when @xmath39 and , as discussed below , for viable models @xmath40 to prevent unreasonably large spectral distortions to the cmb .    combining these equations with the ( unmodified ) equations for the neutrino perturbations we can solve for the linear power spectrum of matter fluctuations in this model .",
    "we have solved these equations using a modified version of cmbfast @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : linear ] we show the linear matter power spectrum in this model for several values of the @xmath14 lifetime @xmath8 and fraction @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in this figure , the small - scale density modes that enter the horizon before the @xmath14 particles decay ( when the age of the universe is less than @xmath8 ) are suppressed relative to the standard case by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "since the decaying particles are charged , the production of the ldp will always be accompanied by an electromagnetic cascade .",
    "the latter could in principle reprocess the light elements produced during bbn , or induce unreasonably large spectral distortions to the cmb .",
    "we show here that in fact these effects are small for the models discussed in this paper .",
    "the energy density released by the decay of @xmath14 particles can be parametrized as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average electromagnetic energy released in a @xmath14 decay and @xmath43 is the dark - matter to photon ratio . in the specific models we discuss below , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 this yields @xmath46 in the models we discuss below , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , giving @xmath49  ev . the limit derived from too much reprocessing of the bbn light element abundances is @xmath50  ev @xcite where @xmath51 , so we are safely below this bound .    for @xmath52",
    ", electromagnetic energy injection will result in a chemical - potential distortion to the cmb of @xcite @xmath53 and so we expect @xmath54    @xmath55 for lifetimes between @xmath56    @xmath57 , below the current limit of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "as density perturbations grow under the influence of gravity , linear evolution ceases to describe their growth and nonlinear effects must be taken into account . on large scales ,",
    "where density perturbations have had insufficient time to become nonlinear , the linear matter power spectrum describes the statistics of density fluctuations .",
    "however , on small scales the full nonlinear matter power spectrum is required .    in order to calculate the nonlinear power spectrum for a given model we have used the recently devised halofit method @xcite .",
    "this method uses higher - order perturbation theory in conjunction with the halo model of large - scale structure to determine the nonlinear power spectrum given a linear power spectrum .",
    "it has been shown to accurately reproduce the nonlinear power spectra of standard n - body simulations and , unlike the earlier mappings such as the peacock and dodds formula @xcite , it is applicable in cases ( like we consider here ) when @xmath59 is not a monotonic function .",
    "in particular we have checked that it approximately reproduces the shapes of the nonlinear power spectra determined in ref .",
    "@xcite through n - body simulations in models where the linear power spectrum is completely cut off on small scales .",
    "as we are discussing here less drastic alterations to the linear power spectrum , we believe the halofit procedure provides an estimate of the nonlinear power spectrum adequate for illustrating the effect we describe in this paper .",
    "any detailed study would require a full n - body simulation .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear_t20][fig : nonlinear_t1 ] we show both the linear and nonlinear matter power spectra at redshift @xmath60 ( data from measurements the lyman-@xmath1 forest probe redshifts 24 at wavenumbers @xmath61@xmath62 ) for a charged - decay model , and for a model with a running spectral index .",
    "although these models have different linear power spectra , nonlinear gravitational evolution causes these models to have nearly identical nonlinear power spectra over interesting ranges of wavenumbers .",
    "the lifetimes shown were chosen because they produce effects on scales that can be probed by measurements of the lyman-@xmath1 forest , while the values @xmath63 were chosen because they arise in the supersymmetric models we discuss below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss_limits ] we show the current constraints on the ( @xmath64,@xmath10 ) parameter space from wmap and sdss lyman-@xmath1 forest data .",
    "the constant-@xmath10 models we have compared our charged - decay model to lie within the wmap+lya contours shown in the figure . since , in each case , the charged - decay model tends to interpolate between the standard @xmath65cdm model on larger scales ( in particular on the scales probed by the cmb ) and a constant-@xmath10 running - index model on smaller scales , and both of them are allowed by these data , we expect the charged - decay models we have considered in figs .  [ fig : nonlinear_t20][fig : nonlinear_t1 ] to be consistent with current data as well .",
    "we leave for future work the task of using a combined analysis of lyman-@xmath1 forest and other cosmological measurements to put limits directly on the ( @xmath6,@xmath8 ) parameter space ( and thus on the parameter space of the mssm models we discuss below ) .",
    "after recombination and the formation of neutral hydrogen , the gas in the universe cools with respect to the cmb temperature @xmath66 starting at at a redshift @xmath67 .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath68 of the gas , which measures the relative populations of the hyperfine levels of the ground state of hydrogen separated by the 21-cm spin - flip transition , remains collisionally coupled to the temperature @xmath69 of the baryons until a redshift @xmath70 when collisions become inefficient and the spin temperature rises to @xmath71 .",
    "there is thus a window between @xmath72@xmath3 in which neutral hydrogen absorbs the cmb at a wavelength of @xmath73 .",
    "it has recently been suggested that the angular fluctuations in the brightness temperature of the 21-cm transition within this window may be measured with future observations and used to constrain the matter power spectrum at these very high redshifts @xcite .    at redshifts @xmath74 ,",
    "the matter power spectrum on the scales @xmath75 of interest here are still in the linear regime . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the unprecedented wealth of potential information contained in these @xmath76-cm measurements , models with a running index or other small - scale modifications of the matter power spectrum can in principle be distinguished from each other . even if the charged - particle lifetime is so small that no significant modifications to the power spectrum occur on scales probed by other cosmological observations ( like the model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlinear_t1 ] ) , 21-cm observations might detect or constrain such effects on the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "from the particle - physics point of view , the setup we have introduced may seem _",
    "ad hoc_. we need a pair of particles that share a conserved quantum number and such that the lightest , the ldp , is neutral and stable , while the other , the nldp , is coupled to the photon and quasi - stable , in order to significantly contribute to the cosmological energy density at an intermediate stage in the structure - formation process .",
    "such a picture requires three ingredients : _ ( i ) _ the relic abundance of the ldp must be compatible with the cdm component ; _ ( ii ) _ the abundance of the nldp must be at the correct level ( namely , @xmath77 the total dark - matter density ) ; and _ ( iii ) _ the nldp must have the proper lifetime ( i.e. , @xmath78 yr ) .",
    "let us start with the last requirement .",
    "one way to get the required lifetime is to introduce a framework with strongly - suppressed couplings .",
    "one such possibility is , for instance , to assume that the ldp is a stable super - weakly  interacting dark - matter particle , such as a gravitino lsp in r - parity  conserving supersymmetric theories or the kaluza - klein first excitation @xmath79 of the graviton in the universal extra - dimension scenario @xcite .",
    "the nldp can have non - zero electric charge , but at the same time a super - weak decay rate into the ldp ( with the latter being the only allowed decay mode ) . in models of gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking",
    ", this might indeed be the case with a stau nlsp decaying into a gravitino lsp . in this specific example",
    ", we have checked that , to retrieve the very long lifetimes we introduced in our discussion , we would need to impose a small mass splitting between the nlsp and lsp , as well as to raise the mass scale of the lsp up to about 100  tev .",
    "this value is most often considered uncomfortably large for a susy setup , and it also makes thermal production of ldps or nldps unlikely , being near a scale at which the unitary bound  @xcite gets violated . without thermal production",
    "one would need to invoke first a mechanism to wipe out the thermal components and then provide a viable non - thermal production scheme that fixes the right portion of ldps versus nldps .",
    "finally , such heavy and extremely weakly - interacting objects would evade any dark - matter detection experiment , and would certainly not be produced at the forthcoming cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "this would then be a scheme that satisfies the three ingredients mentioned above , but that can not be tested in any other way apart from cosmological observations .",
    "an alternative ( and to us , more appealing ) scenario is one where long lifetimes are obtained by considering nearly degenerate ldp and nldp masses . in this case ,",
    "decay rates become small , without suppressed couplings , simply because the phase space allowed in the decay process gets sharply reduced .",
    "sizeable couplings imply that , in the early universe , the ldp and nldp efficiently transform into each other through scattering from background particles .",
    "the small mass splitting , in turn , guarantees that the thermal - equilibrium number densities of the two species are comparable . to describe the process of decoupling and find the thermal relic abundance of these species ,",
    "the number densities of the two have to be traced simultaneously , with the nldp , being charged , playing the major role .",
    "this phenomenon is usually dubbed as _ coannihilation _  @xcite and has been studied at length , being ubiquitous in many frameworks embedding thermal - relic candidates for dark matter , including common susy schemes .",
    "we will show below that sufficiently long lifetimes may be indeed obtained in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , when the role of the nldp is played by a stau nearly degenerate in mass with the lightest neutralino ( with the former being the stable lsp and the thermal - relic cdm candidate we will focus on in the remainder of our discussion ) .",
    "a setup of this kind appears naturally , e.g. , in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite .",
    "this is the susy framework with the smallest possible parameter space , defined by only four continuous entries plus one sign , and hence also one of the most severely constrained by the requirement that the neutralino relic density matches the value from cosmological observations .",
    "neutralino - stau coannihilations determine one of the allowed regions , on the border with the region where the stau , which in the msugra scheme is most often the lightest scalar susy particle , becomes lighter than the neutralino .",
    "although a stau - neutralino mass degeneracy is not `` generic '' in such models , this scenario is economical in that the requirements of a long nldp lifetime and of comparable ldp and nldp relic abundances are both consequences of the mass degeneracy . in this sense ,",
    "evidence for a running spectral index or any of the other observational features we discuss would simply help us sort out which configuration ( if any ) nature has chosen for susy dark matter .",
    "we refer to a mssm setup in which the lightest neutralino @xmath80 is the lightest susy particle .",
    "the charged particles that could play the role of the nldp include : ( 1 ) scalar quarks , ( 2 ) scalar charged leptons , and ( 3 ) charginos .",
    "we now discriminate among these cases by the number of particles in the final states for the decay of nlsps to neutralino lsps .",
    "scalar quarks and leptons have as their dominant decay mode a prompt two - body final state ; i.e. , @xmath81 , where we have labeled @xmath82 the susy scalar partner of the standard - model fermion @xmath83 .",
    "a typical decay width for this process is @xmath84(1 )  gev , corresponding to a lifetime @xmath84@xmath85",
    "s. this holds whenever this final state is kinematically allowed ; i.e. , if @xmath86 . if it is _ kinematically forbidden _ , there are two possibilities : squarks may either decay through ckm - suppressed flavor - changing processes or through four - body decays .",
    "for instance , the stop decay may proceed through @xmath87 or @xmath88 . on the other hand , within the same minimal  flavor - violation framework , scalar leptons",
    "are not allowed to decay in flavor - changing two - body final states , and only the four - body decay option remains .",
    "the case for the chargino is different because this nlsp decay has a three - body final state , either with two quarks bound in a meson state  i.e. , @xmath89  or with a leptonic three body channel  i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "the latter final state becomes dominant , in particular , for electron - type leptons , @xmath91 , if the mass splitting between nlsp and lsp becomes small .",
    "we have listed all decay topologies as these are especially relevant when discussing the limit in which we force a reduction of the allowed decay phase - space volume ; i.e. , the limit in which the nlsp and lsp are quasi - degenerate in mass . here",
    "we can also safely assume that the masses of the final - state particles , apart from the neutralino , are much smaller than the mass of the decaying particle .",
    "we can then consider the limit of a particle of mass @xmath92 decaying into a @xmath80 and @xmath93 massless final states , and derive an analytical approximation to the behavior of the final - state phase space @xmath94 and of the decay width @xmath95 as functions of @xmath96 . in the case of two - body decays",
    ", the phase space reads @xmath97 on the other hand , a recursive relation between @xmath98 and @xmath99 based on the invariant mass of couples of final states yields @xmath100 the dependence of the decay width @xmath95 on @xmath96 must , however , take into account not only the phase - space dependence , but also the behavior of the amplitude squared @xmath101 of the processes as a function of @xmath102 .",
    "the occurrence of a massless final state yields , in the amplitude squared , a factor that scales linearly with the momenta circulating in the feynman diagram .",
    "one therefore has the further factor @xmath103 finally , we have @xmath104 i.e. , the lifetime to decay to a two - body final state scales like @xmath105 , while for a four - body decay we have @xmath106 .    reducing the nlsp mass splitting @xmath96 one may hope to obtain `` cosmologically relevant '' nlsp lifetimes . for scalar quarks ,",
    "this is not quite the case , as two - body final states always dominate , and even for amplitudes that are ckm - suppressed , the scaling with @xmath96 is too shallow , and the resulting lifetimes are rather short , even for very small mass splittings .",
    "the situation is slightly more favorable for charginos , whose three - body decay width is approximately equal to @xmath107 at tree level and in the limit of pure higgsino - like or wino - like states , the lightest neutralino and lightest chargino are perfectly degenerate in mass .",
    "however , when one takes into account loop corrections to the masses , @xmath96 usually turns out to be larger than a few tens of mev ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "this translates into an absolute upper limit on the chargino lifetime of about @xmath108 s.    finally , in the case of sleptons @xmath109 , the interesting regime is when @xmath110 and only four - body decays are allowed .",
    "for example , for the lightest stau @xmath111 , the processes @xmath112 with @xmath113 where , depending on @xmath96 , only final states above the kinematic threshold are included . in this case , @xmath96 can be safely taken as a free parameter of the theory : in most scenarios the gaugino mass parameter setting the neutralino mass for bino - like neutralinos , and the scalar soft mass parameter setting the stau mass , are usually assumed to be independent ; analogously , there are models in which the @xmath114 parameter setting the mass for a higgsino - like neutralino , and scalar soft mass parameter are unrelated .",
    "a similar picture applies to the smuon , though lifetimes start to be enhanced at much smaller mass splittings ( @xmath115 instead of @xmath116 ) , and it is theoretically difficult to figure out a scenario in which the lightest smuon is lighter than the lightest stau .",
    "the scalings we have sketched are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes ] , where we plot lifetimes for a stop ( ckm - suppressed ) , a chargino , and a stau as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "the decaying - particle masses have been set to 1 tev , and the @xmath96 range is between the electron and the tau mass .",
    "the lifetimes of the stop and of the chargino have been computed with sdecay @xcite .",
    "some details on the computation of the stau lifetime are given below .",
    "notice that the scaling of eq .",

    "the bottom line is that indeed _",
    "the lightest stau can play the role of the nldp with a cosmologically relevant lifetime _ , and that the stau is the only particle in the mssm for which this can be guaranteed by adjusting only the ldp - nldp mass splitting .",

    "as we mentioned above , in the framework of minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite one of the few cosmologically allowed regions of parameter space is the tail where the neutralino and the stau are quasi - degenerate . in this case , coannihilations reduce the exceedingly large bino - like neutralino relic abundance to cosmologically acceptable values for neutralino masses up to around 600 gev .",
    "coannihilation effects depend on the relative mass splitting between the two coannihilating species . requiring a mass splitting as small as those found above amounts , as far as the neutralino relic density is concerned , to effectively setting @xmath184 .",

    "the solid line corresponds to negative values of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath114 , while the dashed line corresponds to positive values of @xmath114 . notice that at @xmath189 the accidental overlap of the heavy higgs resonance with the coannihilation strip , around @xmath190 , shifts the neutralino masses to larger values .",
    "we point out that the two requirements of mass degeneracy and of the correct relic density determine , at a given value of @xmath187 , the required mass of the neutralino - stau system , thus solving the residual msugra parameter space degeneracy , and making the present framework testable and predictive .    in the minimal configuration",
    "we have considered , only the lightest neutralino and the lightest stau are playing a role , hence @xmath183 . however , since the mass splitting between the lightest stau and lightest smuon and selectron is rather small , assuming a slight departure from universality in the scalar sector , two additional quasi - degenerate scalar particles can be obtained and the fraction of charged dark matter reduced to @xmath191 .      when the @xmath114 term is lighter than the gaugino masses @xmath193 and @xmath194 , the lightest neutralino gets dominated by the higgsino component .",
    "this situation occurs , again within the msugra model , in the so - called hyperbolic branch / focus point ( hb / fp ) region @xcite , where large values of the common soft breaking scalar mass @xmath195 drive @xmath114 to low values . in this region",
    ", scalars are naturally heavy , at least in the minimal setup ; however , the occurrence of non - universalities in the scalar sector @xcite may significantly affect the sfermion mass pattern .",

    "the relic neutralino abundance is here fixed by the interplay of multiple chargino - stau - neutralino coannihilations . in the limit of pure higgsino , the dynamics of these processes fixes the value of @xmath114 yielding a given relic neutralino abundance . on the other hand , a mixing with the bino component along the borders of the hb / fp region may entail a larger spread in the allowed mass range , affecting the @xmath80 higgsino fraction .",

    "the chargino - neutralino mass splitting is always below the @xmath8 mass , since @xmath80 in mamsb is always a very pure wino , and it has large masses .",

    "diagrams with a charged higgs or a sfermion exchange are moreover further suppressed with respect to those with a @xmath205 exchange by a factor @xmath212 which , depending on the susy spectrum , can also be relevant .    in this respect , a very good approximation to the resulting stau lifetime",

    "concerning higgsinos and winos , instead , the relevant mass range we study here appears to be beyond standard lhc searches @xcite .    even at high - energy colliders ,",

    "the production of what have sometimes been dubbed long - lived _ charged massive particles _",
    "( champ s ) @xcite has been repeatedly addressed .",
    "exclusion limits were determined by the cdf collaboration @xcite , and the future reach of the lhc and of a future linear collider has been also assessed for this broad class of exotic new particles @xcite .",
    "the case of a stable stau has been , in particular , considered several times , since it occurs in the context of various susy - breaking models , like gauge - mediated susy - breaking ( gmsb ) scenarios @xcite ; see also , e.g. , ref .",
    "we remark that , contrary to gmsb , in the present framework the production of long lived staus at accelerators is expected to come along together with the production of neutralinos , thus making the two scenarios distinguishable , at least in principle",
    ".    a long - lived stau would behave as a highly penetrating particle , appearing in the tracking and muon chambers of collider detectors with a small energy deposit in calorimeters .",
    "staus , depending on their velocities , would produce either highly - ionizing tracks in the low-@xmath22 regime , or , if quite relativistic , they would appear similar to energetic muons . in this latter case , one could look at excesses of dimuon or multi - lepton events as a result of superparticle production ; for example , considering the ratio @xmath227 . in case additional particles",
    "have masses close to the neutralino - stau system , the total production cross section of superparticles would be greatly enhanced .",
    "long - lived charginos may also give interesting accelerator signals @xcite .",
    "while the reach of the tevatron appears to be insufficient to probe the parameter space of the models we are considering here @xcite , the discovery of this kind of scenarios at the lhc , though challenging , looks quite conceivable , particularly in the case of binos .",
    "in fact , even in the less promising case in which the particle spectrum does not feature any particle close in mass with the @xmath228 system , the highly - ionizing  track channel should cover a mass range widely overlapping that indicated in fig .",

    "more than twice as many sleptons would also get trapped in the lhc detectors , although in this case a study of the stau properties would look more challenging @xcite .",
    "we have examined a scenario in which a fraction @xmath6 of the cold - dark - matter component in the universe is generated in the decay of long - lived charged particles and shown that a scale - dependent ( or ` running ' ) spectral index is induced . the power spectrum on scales smaller than the horizon size",
    "when the age of the universe is equal to the charged - particle lifetime gets suppressed by a factor @xmath7 . such a feature might be singled out unambiguously by future measurements of the power spectrum of neutral hydrogen through the 21-cm line , obtaining direct information on the charged particle lifetime and @xmath6 .    on the contrary ,",
    "current and future tests for departures from a scale - invariant power spectrum based on lyman-@xmath1 data may fail to uniquely identify the scenario we propose .",
    "in fact , we have estimated the modifications to the non - linear power spectrum at the redshifts and wavenumbers currently probed by lyman-@xmath1 forest data , and shown that these resemble ( but are different in detail ) those in models with a constant running of the spectral index @xmath10 .",
    "we expect , based on this resemblance , models with @xmath6 in the range @xmath231 ( as predicted in some explicit models we have constructed ) to be compatible with current cosmological data for lifetimes in the range @xmath232  yr .",
    "we have also verified that constraints from the primordial light - element abundances and distortions to the cmb spectrum are not violated .    from the particle - physics point of view",
    ", we have shown that the proposed scenario fits nicely in a picture in which the lightest neutralino in susy extensions of the standard model appears as the cold - dark - matter candidate , and a stau nearly degenerate in mass with the neutralino as the long - lived charged counterpart .",
    "a small mass splitting forces the stau to be quasi - stable , since the phase space allowed in the its decay process gets sharply reduced . at the same time",
    ", it implies that neutralino and stau are strongly linked in the process of thermal decoupling , with the charged species playing the major role .",
    "owing to these coannihilation effects , the current neutralino thermal relic abundance is compatible with the value inferred from cosmological observatations and , at early times , the stau thermal relic component is at the correct level .",
    "we have described several explicit realizations of this idea in minimal supersymmetric frameworks , including the minimal supergravity scenario , namely the supersymmetric extension of the standard model with smallest possible parameter space .",

    "<S> we show that charged - particles decaying in the early universe can induce a scale - dependent or ` running ' spectral index in the small - scale linear and nonlinear matter power spectrum and discuss examples of this effect in minimal supersymmetric models in which the lightest neutralino is a viable cold - dark - matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> we find configurations in which the neutralino relic density is set by coannihilations with a long - lived stau , and the late decay of staus partially suppresses the linear matter power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear evolution on small scales then causes the modified linear power spectrum to evolve to a nonlinear power spectrum similar ( but different in detail ) to models parametrized by a constant running @xmath0 by redshifts of 2 to 4 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , lyman-@xmath1 forest observations , which probe the matter power spectrum at these redshifts , might not discriminate between the two effects . </S>",
    "<S> however , a measurement of the angular power spectrum of primordial 21-cm radiation from redshift @xmath2@xmath3 might distinguish between this charged - decay model and a primordial running spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> the direct production of a long - lived charged particle at future colliders is a dramatic prediction of this model . </S>"
