    "spreading phenomena occur in nature in many kinds with examples ranging from epidemics or forest fires @xcite over the growth of populations @xcite and the activity of catalyzers @xcite to the formation of stars and galaxies @xcite . in general terms",
    "the spreading of nonconserved agents has the following scenario : an agent ( e.g. , an active site of a lattice , an infected individual or a burning tree ) randomly activates one or more of its neighbors . in the next timestep",
    "these infected neighbors act as agents themselves and so on . via this elementary reaction ,",
    "the activation spreads out diffusively in @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "competition between the agents for the resources of new activations limits their local density .",
    "moreover , an agent become spontaneously deactivated after some time .",
    "the long term behavior of the process , assumed to be emanating from a seed or germ at the origin , depends crucially on the difference @xmath2 between the deactivation and the activation rate .",
    "for @xmath3 the process spreads , approaching a homogeneous steady state , over the entire space .",
    "for @xmath4 the spreading will finally ebb away as an inactive extinct state is approached ( with possibly a static disturbance of the initial state , but only in a finite volume ) .",
    "the critical point @xmath5 separates this endemic absorbing phase from the epidemic active phase .",
    "spreading near @xmath5 constitutes a critical phenomenon and is described by universal scaling laws .",
    "there exist two fundamental universality classes of critical spreading phenomena depending on the nature of the debris of the elementary deactivation process .",
    "if the deactivated agents can recover so that they may become newly activated ( so called simple epidemic ) , the process belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . here , in the active phase , one can have an epidemic surviving _ in loco_. on the other hand , if the debris stays inactive forever ( so called general epidemic ) , the spreading process becomes locally extinct . in this case",
    ", the process belongs to the dynamic isotropic percolation ( dip ) universality class and the statistics of the clusters formed by the debris are described by the usual percolation theory ( for reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . here , the epidemic can not , of course , survive _ in loco _ , but an infinite epidemic is nevertheless possible in the form of a solitary wave of activity . when starting from a punctual seed , this leads to annular growth ( e.g. , fairy rings in two dimensions ) .    most significantly , perhaps , numerical simulations and renormalization group methods have contributed to our present understanding of spreading phenomena . until recently ,",
    "accurate numerical investigations have been limited to lower spatial dimensions . however , due to the staggering pace of hardware improvements and the development of sophisticated algorithms , numerical results for spreading in high dimensions become available .",
    "some of these results  @xcite clearly indicate the importance of logarithmic corrections to scaling in the upper critical dimensions @xmath6 for dp and @xmath0 for dip .",
    "analytic work on logarithmic corrections to percolation started not long after renormalization group methods became available .",

    "determined the logarithmic corrections for the probability @xmath7 of belonging to an infinite cluster , the clusters mean - square size @xmath8 and the correlation length @xmath9 as functions of the deviation from criticality @xmath10 as well as the logarithmic corrections at criticality to a `` ghost '' field @xmath11 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "aharony  @xcite investigated logarithmic corrections in the context of universal amplitude ratios .",
    "more recently , ruiz - lorenzo  @xcite presented the logarithmic corrections to @xmath8 and @xmath9 at criticality as functions of the system size . in an upshot",
    "one can say that the previous results on logarithmic corrections in percolation are ( i ) restricted to static percolation , and ( ii ) limited to the leading correction .    for another system prominent in statistical physics , viz .",
    "linear polymers , logarithmic corrections observed in simulations have been very successfully described by renormalized field theory  @xcite .",
    "it turned out , however , that the leading logartihmic corrections are not sufficient to yield a satisfactory agreement with the numerical data . to the contrary",
    ", it was found that it is crucial to include the next to leading correction .",
    "we expect a similar importance of the second order correction in the percolation problem .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present analytical results for dip in @xmath0 that are , with reasonable expectation , accurate enough to to yield a satisfactory agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "we derive these results for some of the most interesting observables in dynamic percolation , namely the number @xmath12 of agents ( active infected sites ) at time @xmath13 generated by a seed at the space- and time - wise origin @xmath14 , the survival probability @xmath15 of the corresponding cluster as well as the mean distance @xmath16 of the agents from the origin ( radius of gyration ) .",
    "the logarithmic corrections that we study here will not be found in real physical systems because the upper critical dimension 6 for dip does not coincide with physical dimensions , @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "however , our results are sure to be valuable with respect to numerical simulations .",
    "our final analytic expressions are well suitable for comparison to numerical data . moreover",
    ", our results define a non - universal time scale that signals the onset of asymptotic behavior .",
    "this time scale may be used to assess the effective significance of a given microscopic simulation model for the dip universality class .",
    "complementary to the work presented here we have investigated logarithmic corrections in dp .",
    "our results on observables akin to the quantities studied here are certainly equally interesting and will be presented in the near future  @xcite . taking a third route , we explored logarithmic corrections in static ip with emphasis on transport properties",
    ". a paper on this subject  @xcite will be available soon .",
    "the outline of the present paper is the following : in sec .",
    "[ reviewgep ] we briefly review the renormalized field theory of the general epidemic process ( gep ) and previous renormalization group results on dip . moreover , we conduct some general considerations about logarithmic corrections in the given context .",

    "section  [ conclus ] concludes the main part of this paper with a discussion of our results and several remarks .",
    "details of our diagrammatic perturbation calculation are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in this section we briefly review the field theoretic description of the gep and its renormalization . the aim is to provide the reader with background and to establish notation as well as known results that we need as we go along .",
    "furthermore , we outline the general structure of the sought after logarithmic corrections .",

    "the gep can be minimally formulated by means of the langevin equation in the ito sense @xcite    [ langandnoise]@xmath19 here @xmath20 is the density of infected particles at time @xmath13 and space coordinate @xmath21 .",

    "many other analytic terms are conceivable as contributing to eqs .",

    "langevin equations are only a convenient shorthand for a stochastic process .",
    "for the application of renormalized field theory , however , a path integral formulation of the gep is more adequate than the langevin equation  ( [ langandnoise ] ) .",
