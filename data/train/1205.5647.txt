    "in many applicative problems one has to consider a stochastic system evolving in a finite not empty state space driven by an energy function .",
    "the details of the dynamics depend on the system that one has to model , but in most cases the motion is driven by the energy landscape @xcite .",
    "the typical trajectories are those decreasing the energy ; on the other hand with small probability the system can perform jumps against the energy drift .",
    "the smallness of the probability associated to moves against the energy drift is controlled by some cost function .",
    "this cost is often given by the difference of energy between the two states involved in the move .",
    "this is the situation that one has to face when studying the evolution of glauber dynamics associated with statistical mechanics lattice models @xcite .",
    "depending on the model , different cost functions can be introduced .",
    "an example , which deserved a lot of attention in the recent literature , is that of reversible @xcite probabilistic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "the stochastic dynamics is often controlled by a parameter , say the _ temperature _ , whose value tunes the amount of randomness in the motion by increasing or decreasing the probability of the moves against the drift .",
    "when the temperature is very low the system freezes and tends to stick to the energy drift dynamics ending up to be trapped in the minima of the energy .",
    "when the temperature is very high , on the other hand , jumps against the drift are highly probable and the system moves almost freely in the state space .",
    "it is then clear that a huge amount of information about the low temperature dynamics is obtained when one knows ( i ) the structure of the absolute minima of the energy ( ground states ) and ( ii ) the maximal barrier that has to be overcome to reach the set of the ground states starting from any possible state , namely , the _ relaxation height_. the severity of problem ( i ) strongly depends on the particular expression of the energy function , but in most applications it is not a particularly difficult task .",
    "problem ( ii ) , on the other hand , is always a very laborious ( and sometimes hard ) one since the solution of several variational problems is involved .",
    "the relaxation height is of basic importance in the study of this kind of dynamics .",
    "for instance , when dealing with the description of the metastable behavior of statistical mechanics systems , the relaxation height is the quantity controlling the typical time the system waits before nucleating the stable state starting from the metastable one @xcite .",
    "the problem of computing the relaxation height in specific model is often very hard , in particular when there are several states connected to the ground states via cost barriers equal to the relaxation height .",
    "this situation is found , for instance , in models with more than one metastable state @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall discuss some generic properties of the relaxation height and , in particular , we shall setup a quite general strategy for its computation .",
    "subsequently we shall apply the theory to the very interesting case of the blume ",
    "capel model @xcite for a choice of the parameter ensuring the existence of two not degenerate in energy metastable states .",
    "due to the presence of multiple metastable states this case is particularly interesting and , a priori , very difficult to be treated .",
    "the blume ",
    "capel model has been originally introduced in @xcite to study some particular magnetic systems .",
    "the model was then generalized to the so called blume  emery ",
    "griffiths model @xcite in order to describe the @xmath0 transition in he@xmath1he@xmath2 mixtures .",
    "those models have been widely studied in the literature and many applications have been considered .",
    "their particular interest is due to fact that in these three state spin systems on lattice different energies are associated with different interfaces .",
    "this is not the case in other multi  state spin systems , such as the well known potts model , where a ferromagnetic coupling favors the presence of neighboring homologous spins and the same energy cost is assigned to any pair of differing neighboring spins .",
    "this fact is very peculiar of the blume  capel model and gives rise to very interesting phenomena when the metastable behavior of the system is considered .",
    "indeed it is seen that even if one of the three states is not favored from the energetic point of view , it can ( and indeed does ) behave as a bearing between the other two phases if the interfaces between this particular state and the other two ones are energetically less expensive ( see , for instance , the proof of item  [ i : mdep - bc01 - 02 ] in lemma  [ t : mdep - bc01 ] where this effect appears in all its importance ) .",
    "in @xcite the authors studied metastability in the blume ",
    "capel model in the so called wentzell  friedlin regime , that is they considered finite volume , finite positive magnetic field , and let the temperature tend to zero . in that paper a wide region of the space of parameters of the model was analyzed .",
    "more precisely , denoted by @xmath0 the chemical potential ( see equation ( [ ham - bc ] ) below ) and by @xmath3 the magnetic field , the region @xmath4 was studied in detail .",
    "it was proven that in that region the hamiltonian of the system has a single ground state @xmath5 , namely , the configuration with all the spins equal to plus one , and that the system admits a single metastable state , that is the configuration @xmath6 with all the spins equal to minus one .",
    "it was also proven that the configuration @xmath7 , with all the spins equal to zero , plays an important role . for @xmath8",
    "the transition from the metastable state @xmath6 to the stable one @xmath5 is direct , although the plus droplet growing inside the minus phase is  protected \" by a thin frame of zeros . for @xmath9 ,",
    "on the other hand , during the transition the system visits the intermediate ( not metastable ) state @xmath7 .",
    "this kind of phenomena is not expected to be observed in multi ",
    "state spin systems such as the potts model where all the interfaces pay the same energy cost .    in @xcite the study of the metastable behavior of the blume ",
    "capel model was addressed in infinite volume in the regime characterized by finite @xmath0 and @xmath3 and temperature tending to zero . in that paper",
    "the authors studied the regions @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the space of parameters , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1 ) , and proved that , starting from @xmath6 , in the first one the state @xmath7 is observed before the transition to @xmath5 , while in the second one it is not .",
    "this result , looked at from the finite volume point of view , suggests that at negative @xmath0 the state @xmath7 is metastable while at positive @xmath0 it is not .",
    "the first of these two remarks was discussed , on heuristics grounds , in @xcite , while the second was indeed proven in @xcite .",
    "we can then conjecture that in the peculiar case @xmath12 and @xmath13 both @xmath6 and @xmath7 are metastable .",
    "in other words we expect that for this choice of the parameters the blume  capel model shows the very interesting phenomenon of multiple not degenerate in energy metastable states ( see figure  [ f : fig01 ] ) .",

    "it is worth noting , on the other hand , that computing the maximal stability level of a concrete model is a hard task .",
    "indeed , one has to solve the variational problem @xmath82 for any @xmath66 .",

    "these states are not  maximally stable \" metastable states , but , to some extent , they can be considered metastable since the energy barrier @xmath151 has to be payed in order to decrease the energy .",
    "the potential theoretical approach is well suited to study also these states , indeed one just have to look for the p.t.a.metastable states inside the new set just defined above .",
