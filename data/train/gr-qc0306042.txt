    "in this paper we discuss the question of how to define inertial forces in an arbitrary general - relativistic spacetime , i.e. , in a lorentzian manifold @xmath0 . given a particle s worldline @xmath3 in @xmath4 ,",
    "the 4-acceleration of @xmath3 is unambiguously defined .",
    "the negative 4-acceleration of @xmath3 gives the acceleration of a freely falling particle relative to @xmath3 .",
    "after multiplication with the freely falling particle s mass we get the total `` apparent force '' that acts , in the view of @xmath3 , upon the freely falling particle . by the question of how to define inertial forces we mean the question of how to decompose this total `` apparent force '' into gravitational , centrifugal , coriolis and euler force .",
    "this decomposition requires some additional information , i.e. , it can not be done in an absolute way .",
    "( the statement that the gravitational force has no absolute meaning is one version of the equivalence principle . ) in a static or stationary spacetime , this additional information is provided by the timelike killing vector field which , after normalization , can be interpreted as the 4-velocity field of a distinguished family of observers . with respect to this distinguished observer field , inertial forces can be uniquely assigned to each particle s worldline , as was discussed by abramowicz and collaborators in various articles , see , e.g. abramowicz , carter and lasota @xcite , abramowicz and prasanna @xcite and abramowicz @xcite .",
    "they also provided a geometric interpretation of inertial forces in terms of the so - called reference-3-geometry that was obtained by conformally adjusting the quotient - space metric . for a discussion of these ideas",
    "we also refer to a forthcoming book by abramowicz and sonego @xcite .    the results in static and stationary spacetimes led abramowicz and others to seek for particular observer fields in general spacetimes that allowed to define similar reference-3-geometries and thus to generalize the notion of inertial forces to general spacetimes .",
    "however , their suggested generalizations ( see abramowicz , nurowski and wex @xcite ) have been partially criticized by several authors ( see for example de felice @xcite , sonego and massar @xcite and bini , carini and jantzen @xcite ) .",
    "some of the critical comments refer to the fact that the inertial forces , as defined in @xcite , have unwanted features , others to the fact that they are in a certain sense ambiguous .",
    "thus , it seems fair to say that the appropriate definition of inertial forces in arbitrary spacetimes is still a matter of debate .    in this paper",
    "we turn away from the idea that in arbitrary spacetimes inertial forces should be defined with respect to an observer field with particular properties .",
    "we rather define inertial forces with respect to arbitrary timelike surfaces @xmath1 and arbitrary observer fields given on @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we choose , in an arbitrary spacetime @xmath0 , a timelike surface @xmath1 and a vector field @xmath2 on @xmath1 that is normalized to @xmath5 .",
    "we demonstrate that then gravitational , centrifugal , coriolis and euler forces can be unambiguously assigned to any particle s worldline @xmath3 contained in @xmath1 .",
    "these definitions will be given in section [ sec - inertial ] below .",
    "for the sake of illustration , one may interpret @xmath1 as the worldsheet of a roller - coaster track and @xmath2 as the 4-velocity field of observers distributed along the track .",
    "then the worldlines @xmath3 contained in @xmath1 can be associated with the motions allowed for cars that are bound to the roller - coaster track but are free to move arbitrarily along the track .",
    "this roller - coaster interpretation , which was used e.g. by abramowicz in @xcite , is quite helpful for associating inertial forces with physical intuition .",
    "however , we emphasize that the roller - coaster interpretation is only a didactical means . for our mathematical results to be true",
    "it is not necessary to associate @xmath1 with a material object .",
    "the idea of defining the centrifugal force with respect to a prescribed spatial track can be traced back to huygens , whereas the definition usually given in mechanics text - books is due to newton , see abramowicz @xcite , p.735/736 . our definitions of inertial forces in section [ sec - inertial ] can be viewed as a literal adaptation of huygens definition of centrifugal force to general relativity .",
    "we share abramowicz s view that , in the context of general relativity , newton s definition is not appropriate .",
    "if a timelike vector field @xmath6 has been chosen on @xmath0 , every timelike curve @xmath3 that is nowhere tangent to @xmath6 naturally defines a timelike surface @xmath1 , namely the set of all points that can be connected to @xmath3 by an integral curve of @xmath6 . restricting to @xmath1 and normalizing @xmath6 gives a vector field @xmath2 on @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "once a timelike vector field @xmath6 has been chosen on @xmath0 we have a distinguished choice for @xmath7 and , thus , unique inertial forces for every worldline @xmath3 that is nowhere tangent to @xmath6 .",
    "( for a @xmath3 that is tangent to @xmath6 , at some points or everywhere , we may choose any timelike surface @xmath1 that contains @xmath3 and is invariant under the flow of @xmath6 ; the inertial forces defined along @xmath3 turn out to be the same for all these choices . )",
    "the crucial point is that @xmath6 need not satisfy any additional condition . in the special case that @xmath6 is a killing vector field our definition of inertial forces reduces to the generally accepted one in static or stationary spacetimes .    having defined inertial forces with respect to a timelike surface @xmath1 , it is an interesting problem to determine those @xmath1 for which centrifugal and coriolis forces vanish .",
    "we do this in section [ sec - theorems ] by proving the    [ theo - main ] let @xmath0 be an arbitrary spacetime and @xmath1 a @xmath8-dimensional timelike submanifold of @xmath4 .",
    "then the following properties are mutually equivalent :    ( i ) : :    for every particle worldline @xmath3 contained in    @xmath1 the centrifugal and coriolis forces with respect    to any vector field @xmath2 on @xmath1 with    @xmath5 vanish .",
    "( ii ) : :    @xmath1 is generated by two congruences of lightlike    geodesics .",
    "( iii ) : :    if @xmath2 and @xmath9 are any two vector fields on    @xmath1 with @xmath10    and @xmath11 , the vector field @xmath9    is fermi - walker - parallel along @xmath2 , i.e. ,    @xmath12 is a multiple of @xmath2 .",
    "if we interpret @xmath1 as the worldsheet of a track , property ( ii ) means that the track appears straight to the eye of an observer who looks ( `` backward '' or `` forward '' ) along the track . as , according to general relativity , a gyroscope always remains fermi - walker - parallel to itself ( see , e.g. misner , thorne and wheeler @xcite , sect .",
    "40.7 ) , property ( iii ) means that when transported along the track a gyroscope whose axis is initially parallel to the track always stays parallel to the track .",
    "note that , although the centrifugal and coriolis forces depend on the choice of @xmath2 , theorem [ theo - main ] demonstrates that the condition of vanishing centrifugal and coriolis forces is independent of @xmath2 , i.e. , it is a geometric property of @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , theorem [ theo - main ] implies that properties ( i ) and ( iii ) are conformally invariant because property ( ii ) obviously is .",
    "the conformal invariance of property ( iii ) reflects the known fact that the notion of an `` inertial compass '' is conformally invariant .    a trivial example for a timelike surface @xmath1 that obviously satisfies property ( ii ) and , thus , properties ( i ) and ( iii ) of theorem [ theo - main ] is a timelike plane in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the best known non - trivial example is the surface @xmath13 , @xmath14 in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "if we interpret this surface as the worldsheet of a track , someone moving along this track feels neither centrifugal nor coriolis forces , although the track is circular ; at the same time , properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) demonstrate that the track appears straight to the eye and turns out to be straight if deviation from straightness is measured by transporting a gyroscope .",
    "in generalizing this well - known schwarzschild example , abramowicz @xcite has considered timelike surfaces that are invariant under the flow of the killing vector fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 in a static axisymmetric spacetime .",
    "he has shown that in this case property ( i ) of theorem [ theo - main ] implies properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "our result generalizes this observation to arbitrary timelike surfaces in arbitrary spacetimes .",
    "theorem [ theo - main ] gives three equivalent characterizations of surfaces but it does not say anything about the existence of such surfaces in arbitrary spacetimes .",
    "we call a 2-dimensional timelike submanifold @xmath1 that satisfies property ( ii ) and , thus , properties ( i ) and ( iii ) of theorem [ theo - main ] a _ timelike photon @xmath8-surface_. a similar notion was used by claudel , virbhadra and ellis @xcite . in arbitrary spacetimes , the existence of timelike photon 2-surfaces is not guaranteed .",
    "some existence criteria and construction methods are presented in section [ sec - photonsurface ] .",
    "finally in section [ sec - examples ] we give various examples for timelike photon 2-surfaces .",
    "in this section we define the inertial forces in an arbitrary spacetime . here , by a spacetime we mean any finite - dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath0 . for physical reasons",
    ", @xmath0 should be 4-dimensional , time - orientable , and connected ; mathematically , however , we shall not need these particular assumptions .",
    "our results are non - trivial only if @xmath4 is at least 3-dimensional .    throughout this paper ,",
    "our conventions are as follows .",
    "we use physical units making the velocity of light equal to one and our sign convention for the lorentzian signature is @xmath17 .",
    "the levi - civita derivative of @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 . all ( sub)manifolds and maps are tacitly assumed to be sufficiently often differentiable such that the written derivatives exist . by a submanifold",
    "we mean what is more fully called an immersed submanifold , as opposed to an imbedded submanifold , i.e. , we allow for self - intersections .",
    "this is irrelevant for the definition of inertial forces , which is purely local , and for the three conditions in theorem [ theo - main ] , whose equivalence can be verified for arbitrarily small pieces of @xmath1 ; however , it is important to note that our construction methods for photon surfaces may yield surfaces with self - intersections . for a submanifold @xmath1",
    ", we distinguish between vector fields _ on _ @xmath1 and vector fields _ along _ @xmath1 .",
    "a vector field on @xmath1 assigns to each point @xmath20 a vector in the tangent space @xmath21 whereas a vector field along @xmath1 assigns to @xmath20 a vector in the tangent space @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the immersion @xmath24 .",
    "( an analogous terminology applies to tensor fields of higher rank . ) to make the distinction easily seen we use lower - case letters for vector fields on a submanifold of @xmath4 and upper - case letters for vector fields that take values in the full tangent space of @xmath4 .",
    "what we need in order to define the inertial forces is a pair @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is a 2-dimensional timelike submanifold of @xmath4 , and @xmath2 is a vector field on @xmath25 with @xmath5 . given any timelike curve",
    "@xmath26 whose tangent vector field @xmath27 satisfies the usual 4-velocity normalization condition @xmath28 , it is our goal to assign inertial accelerations to @xmath3 with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the inertial forces acting upon a particle are then given by multiplying the inertial accelerations with the particle s mass .",
    "with @xmath7 given , the conditions @xmath29 define a vector field @xmath9 on @xmath1 uniquely up to sign . after fixing @xmath9 by choosing one of the two signs",
    ", we can decompose the 4-velocity @xmath30 of each worldline @xmath3 in the form @xmath31 this equation defines the spatial velocity @xmath32 of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath33 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath32 is a map that assigns to the curve parameter a number between @xmath34 and 1 . from ( [ eqn - defv ] )",
    "we can calculate the 4-acceleration @xmath35 of @xmath3 , @xmath36 as @xmath35 gives the acceleration of @xmath3 relative to freely falling particles , relative to @xmath3 a freely falling particle is subject to the `` inertial acceleration '' @xmath37 . the gravitational , centrifugal , coriolis and euler accelerations with respect to the observer field @xmath2",
    "are obtained by the following unique decomposition of @xmath38 ( and multiplication with the freely falling particle s mass gives the respective forces ) .",

    "whereas @xmath53 and @xmath54 are always perpendicular to @xmath1 and @xmath55 is always parallel to @xmath1 , the gravitational acceleration has , in general , a component perpendicular and a component parallel to @xmath1 , say @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the components of @xmath38 perpendicular and parallel to @xmath1 are , respectively , @xmath57 clearly , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are invariant with respect to changing the observer field @xmath2",

    "if we interpret @xmath1 as the worldsheet of a track , @xmath58 gives the inertial acceleration perpendicular to the track whereas @xmath59 gives the inertial acceleration parallel to the track .",
    "the latter involves a derivative of the velocity that enters into the euler force ; hence , it depends on whether the particle accelerates or decelerates in the direction of the track . as a consequence",
