    "the problem of the interaction of an atomic system with a radiation field is a keystone of quantum optics . needless to say ,",
    "it is impossible to obtain exact solutions to this problem and some approximations must be used ; the most common being that the radiation field is quasimonochromatic and its frequency coincides almost exactly with one of the transition frequencies of the atoms ( supposed identical and with no direct interaction between them ) .",
    "the two - level atom is the natural consequence of this hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "such an object is an important tool because it allows us to describe the matter - field interaction in a very simple way , and the results constitute a first step to deal with more realistic situations that could include losses , broadening of the atomic lines , etc . to put it bluntly",
    ", we can replace the whole atomic system by an effective two - level system that accounts for all the relevant details of the interaction .",
    "the dicke model  @xcite , describing the interaction of @xmath0 identical two - level atoms with a single - mode field in a perfect cavity , is perhaps the archetype of this situation .    in the semiclassical version of this dicke model",
    ", correlations are safely ignored and the field is interpreted to be a purely classical electric field  @xcite .",
    "such an approximation has proven to be very successful and has the virtue of reducing the problem to the exclusive knowledge of the atomic dynamics , which is studied in terms of the inversion and the components of the atomic dipole in - phase and in - quadrature with the field ( i.e. , the bloch vector ) .",
    "these quadratures are the dispersive and absorptive components of the dipole moment effective in coupling to the field .    for some phenomena , such as spontaneous emission by a fully excited atomic system ,",
    "the quantization of the field is required .",
    "then , one must take care also of the evolution of the field amplitudes , but the atomic dynamics is still explained in terms of inversion and dipole quadratures .",
    "classically , the interaction of matter with light is usually treated within the framework of the lorentz model  @xcite , which assumes that each electron - ion pair behaves as a single harmonic oscillator that couples to the field through its electric dipole moment . in spite of its simplicity",
    ", it is extraordinarily helpful in developing an intuitive feeling for the physical mechanisms involved .",
    "although the dynamics of this model is sometimes expressed in quadrature components  @xcite , the natural way of understanding its resonant behavior is in terms of the relative phase between the field and the atomic dipole  @xcite .    while the quantum quadratures are well known , and so are the associated eigenstates , the operator for this relative phase has resisted a quantum description . at this respect , we think that , in spite of its maturity and success , the dicke model is apparently incomplete since it lacks a satisfactory description in terms of this relative phase , indispensable to compare with the classical world .",
    "the main goal of this paper is precisely the general description of that variable .    when focusing on the relative phase between two subsystems , we think the best way to proceed , much in the spirit of our previous work in the subject  @xcite , is to try a polar decomposition of the quantum amplitudes , which parallels as much as possible the corresponding classical factorization . for the relative phase between two harmonic oscillators ,",
    "this is a quite straightforward procedure and leads to a unitary solution  @xcite .    for the dicke model",
    ", this polar decomposition seems to be more involved , mainly because , unlike for the case of two harmonic oscillators , the hamiltonian can not be cast in terms of su(2 ) operators , but rather in terms of some polynomial deformation of su(2 ) .",
    "these nonlinear algebras have been examined very recently in quite different physical contexts  @xcite , and , by exploiting these results , it is possible to perform such a decomposition in an elegant way , obtaining a _ bona fide _ hermitian operator representing the relative phase we wish to examine .    in this paper",
    "we use this operator to introduce the associated probability distribution and , then , the most relevant dynamical features of the dicke model can be easily explained using this relevant variable .",
    "the dicke model describes the interaction of a collection of @xmath0 identical two - level atoms with a quantum single - mode field in a lossless cavity .",
    "the spatial dimensions of the atomic system are smaller than the wavelength of the field , so all the atoms feel the same field . however",
    ", the model neglects the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms ( i.e. , their wavefunctions do not overlap in the evolution ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model in the electric - dipole and rotating - wave approximations reads as ( in units @xmath1 ) @xmath2 with @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the excitation number operator , @xmath5 is the coupling constant ( which in this approximation is the same for all the atoms and can be chosen as real ) , and @xmath6 is the detuning between the atomic and field frequencies .",
    "the field mode is described by the annihilation and creation operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while the collective atomic operators are defined by @xmath9 and obey the commutation relations @xmath10",
    "= \\pm s_\\pm , \\qquad   [ s_+ , s_- ]   =    2 s_3 .\\ ] ]    since all the atoms have the same coupling constant , we need to consider only symmetrical atomic states .",
    "then , let us introduce the atomic dicke states as  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the eigenstates of the @xmath13th atom and the sum runs over all possible manners of choosing @xmath14 indistinguishable atoms from the group of @xmath0 atoms .",
    "in the space spanned by these dicke states , the action of the collective atomic operators is @xmath15 where the label @xmath14 ( @xmath16 ) denotes the number of excited atoms and @xmath17 represents the bottom energy level of the atomic system .",
    "therefore , the collective atomic operators form a @xmath18-dimensional representation of the algebra su(2 ) corresponding to a spin @xmath19 .",
    "the case of a single resonant atom @xmath20 corresponds to the well - known jaynes - cummings model .    for simplicity we shall restrict henceforth our attention to case of exact resonance between the atomic and the field frequency @xmath21 .",
    "since the field mode is described in the usual fock space @xmath22 , the natural bare basis for the total system is @xmath23 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to check that @xmath24 =   0 , \\ ] ] so both are constants of motion .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath25 ( or , equivalently , the excitation number @xmath26 ) determines the total energy stored by the radiation field and the atomic system , which is conserved by the interaction .",
    "this means that the appearance of @xmath14 excited atoms requires the annihilation of @xmath14 photons .",
    "this allows us to factor out @xmath27 from the evolution operator and drop it altogether .",
    "hence , we can relabel the total basis as @xmath28    in such a basis , the interaction hamiltonian , for a fixed value of @xmath26 , is represented by the tridiagonal matrix @xmath29 with @xmath30 the dimension of this matrix depends on whether @xmath31 or @xmath32 , which are situations essentially different and must be handled separately .",
    "let us assume that @xmath31 and initially all the atoms are unexcited .",
    "then , @xmath33 and the conservation of the number of excitations implies that only the states ( [ basis ] ) with @xmath34 take part in the dynamics . thus , the dimension of the subspace is @xmath35 .    on the contrary , when @xmath32 the number of initial photons is greater than the number of atoms and only the states ( [ basis ] ) with @xmath16 are involved in the evolution .",
    "the dimension is now @xmath36    it is easy to check that , due to the properties of the tridiagonal matrices , the eigenvalues are distributed symmetrically with respect to zero , with one eigenvalue equal to zero if there are an odd number of them  @xcite .    to find the state evolution we shall need the following matrix elements of the evolution operator @xmath37     @xmath38   , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the hamiltonian and @xmath40 are the corresponding eigenvalues . in what follows we shall use the convention of denoting the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath41 by @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43    now , let us assume that the initial field is taken to be in a coherent state @xmath44 and that the atomic state is initially prepared in an atomic coherent state @xmath45  @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath46 @xmath47 being the poissonian weighting factor of the coherent state ( with zero phase ) with mean number of photons @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 is normally rewritten in terms of the spherical angles as @xmath51 in other words , the initial state can be rewritten , taking into account ( [ basis ] ) , as @xmath52 or @xmath47 , equation  ( [ evol ] ) is still valid when the appropriate coefficients are taken .",
    "in the spirit of our previous work on the relative phase for the jaynes - cummings model  @xcite , we shall describe the atom - field relative phase in terms of a polar decomposition of the complex amplitudes . to this end , let us introduce the operators @xmath53 these operators maintain the first commutation relation of su(2 ) in ( [ ccrsu2 ] ) , @xmath54   =    \\pm x_\\pm$ ] , but the second one is modified in the following way : @xmath55 = p ( x_3 )   , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 represents a second - order polynomial function of the operator @xmath57 .",
    "this is a typical example of the so - called polynomial deformations of the algebra su(2 ) . without embarking us in mathematical subtleties , the essential point for our purposes here",
    "is that one can develop a theory in a very close analogy with the standard su(2 ) algebra . in particular , it is clear that the state @xmath58 plays the role of a _ vacuum state _ , since @xmath59 then , we can construct invariant subspaces , as in the usual theory of angular momentum , by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a normalization constant .",
    "one can check that @xmath62 confirming that the number of accessible states is @xmath63 .",
    "in consequence , the whole space of the system can be split as the direct sum @xmath64 of subspaces invariant under the action of the operators @xmath65 and each one of them having a fixed number of excitations .",
    "these independent subspaces do not overlap in the evolution , in such a way that if the initial state belongs to one of them , it will remain in that subspace for all the evolution .    in each one of these invariant subspaces",
    "the operator @xmath57 is diagonal , while @xmath66 and @xmath67 are ladder operators represented by finite - dimensional matrices .",
    "this suggests to introduce a polar decomposition in the form @xmath68 where the _ radial _ operator @xmath69 is diagonal in the basis @xmath70 : @xmath71 and @xmath72 = e .\\ ] ]    we can guarantee now that the operator @xmath73 , representing the exponential of the relative phase , is unitary and commutes with the excitation number @xmath74 = 0   . &   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we may rather study its restriction to each invariant subspace @xmath75 , we shall denote by @xmath76 .",
    "it is easy to check that the action of the operator @xmath76 in each subspace is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] when the atoms are initially unexcited or excited ( or , more generally , when @xmath193 ) and for any initial state of field , we have @xmath194 for all the times .    for an arbitrary initial state of the atomic system and the field",
    "we get @xmath195 with @xmath196 m-   3 \\lambda m^2.\\ ] ] since ( [ hamef ] ) is quadratic in the population inversion operator @xmath117 and is , therefore , analogous to the hamiltonian quadratic in the number operator of a single - mode field propagating through a kerr medium , one could expect  @xcite that the evolution of coherent atomic states in the dispersive limit of the dicke model leads to the generation of schrdinger cat states .",
    "this superposition reaches the most pure form for initial number field states ( in particular , the vacuum state minimizes the atomic entropy  @xcite ) .",
    "the situation with the relative - phase distribution is quite different .",
    "it is easy to see , for example , that if the field is prepared initially in a number state @xmath197 then @xmath198 and the relative phase distribution is flat .",
    "nevertheless , for initial atomic and field coherent states the relative - phase distribution splits for some special times into several humps .",
    "these catlike states , according to ( [ fmn ] ) , appear at times @xmath199 .",
    "to confirm analytically this behavior , we expand eq .",
    "( [ shcat ] ) when initially we have strong coherent states for both field and atoms , with @xmath200 . by replacing once again the sum by integrals ,",
    "one easily gets @xmath201 ^ 2 a/2 }   + e^{- \\left [ \\phi + \\pi - \\pi \\phi_{\\bar{n}}/(3 \\lambda ) \\right ] ^2 a/2 } \\right \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath202 and all the phases must be understood @xmath203 .",
    "the two separated gaussians indicates the presence of two humps and , therefore , the presence of catlike states . to further confirm this , in fig .",
    "4 we have computed numerically the distribution function @xmath204 at the times predicted by the theory .",
    "the graphic clearly demonstrates the presence of the two - component state , according to our previous considerations .",
    "in this paper we have investigated an appropriate operator for the quantum description of the relative phase in the dicke model .",
    "we have used a proper polar decomposition of the corresponding field amplitudes , much in the spirit of our previous work on the subject .",
    "this polar decomposition has been justified on physical grounds , as well as using the theory of polynomial deformations of su(2 ) .",
    "the eigenvalue spectrum of this operator is discrete , as it happens for the polar decomposition corresponding to two field modes . from these eigenstates",
    "we have obtained the probability distribution for the relative phase and we have studied its time evolution . for the weak - field region , the behavior is essentially oscillatory , while for the strong - field region , the relative phase tends to be randomized in the evolution , although showing collapses and revivals . for both limiting regions ,",
    "we have developed analytical approximations that have allowed us an easy physical interpretation of some remarkable phenomena .",
