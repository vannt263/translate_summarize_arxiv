    "we think it may be interesting to note that there is a physically realistic class of condensed matter systems that naturally exhibit some of the features predicted in equation  ( [ eq : visser.sfree ] ) .",

    "we will see that adding anisotropic scaling in the ultraviolet greatly improves the situation .",
    "in the following discussion we will introduce a `` real life '' example where the notion of geometry is emergent .",
    "the emergent spacetime we are going to study closely involves : ( i ) a microscopic system consisting of an ultra - cold weakly interacting gas of bosons ; ( ii ) which exhibits ( after a first - order phase transition ) a mean - field regime where the microscopic degrees of freedom give way to collective variables ; ( iii ) small perturbations above the ground state which are dominated by a ` geometrical object ' , a symmetric second rank tensor ; ( iv ) lorentz symmetry as an emergent symmetry in the infrared , while at higher energies the effective field theory shows anisotropic scaling in time and space ; ( v ) the signature of the emergent spacetime is of microscopic origin and can be ` switched ' by the application of external magnetic fields .",

    "this is not just an `` in principle '' possibility , since in 2001 a bec experiment  @xcite was carried out that can be viewed as the first emergent spacetime experiment involving particle production resulting from a signature change event , see  @xcite . for a detailed discussion regarding the behaviour of the effective field theory exposed to a finite region of riemannian signature consult  @xcite .",
    "there it has been shown that at very high momenta , due to the anisotropic scaling of time and space , the number of quasi - particles being produced in sudden signature variations of the form lorentzian ",

    "we have discussed the concept of a spacetime emergent from a bose ",
    "einstein condensate , and the possibility of signature change events within this context  @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in quantum gravity models sacrificing lorentz symmetry as an exact symmetry in order to obtain better control of the ultraviolet behaviour of quantum gravitational / field excitations  @xcite , has motivated us to emphasise some of the features that ` anisotropic scaling ' and the presence of lorentz - violating lifschitz points may contribute to the subject of condensed - matter emergent spacetimes .",
    "we have , in brief , demonstrated how spacetime geometry  as seen by quasiparticle excitations  emerges from a mean - field structure that is truly quantum in origin  @xcite .",
    "although this model has no direct connection or application to the search of a quantum theory of gravity , we have shown that it nevertheless exhibits some ( but not all ) of the features that are essential to hoava  lifschitz gravity .",
    "the key features are that lorentz symmetry is an emergent symmetry in the infrared , and that the non - perturbative terms added at the level of the effective field theory are anisotropic in space and time , involving only higher spatial derivatives .",
    "in fact , these two features seem to be common to all known emergent spacetimes , independent of the specific media from which they are emergent  _ e.g. _ , water , superfluids , electromagnetic waveguides , _ etc_.    coming back to the specific model at hand , the bose ",
    "einstein condensate , we would like to point out that the free - field description for small perturbations is only an approximation .",
    "we are , strictly speaking , dealing with an interacting field theory , but due to the anisotropic scaling naturally built into the effective field theory the ultraviolet regime has some advantages compared to conventional field theories . a specific way to explore",
    "this is by exposing the effective field theory to one of the most drastic gravitational scenarios possible ( besides curvature singularities ) : signature change events .",
    "while for a @xmath86 ( lorentz invariant ) scaling of time and space the canonical quantisation scheme applied to quantum field theories on riemannian manifolds breaks down , predicting infinite quasi - particle production per unit volume , we see that in contrast @xmath17 anisotropic scaling is already sufficient to render quasiparticle production finite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that at @xmath2 the energy density per volume will also be finite  @xcite .",
