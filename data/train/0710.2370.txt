    "@xcite compared the @xmath3 colours of parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phjfs ) @xcite quasars to those of large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) @xcite quasars .",
    "the phjfs quasars were found to have a significantly broader and redder distribution of @xmath3 colours than lbqs quasars .",
    "this disparity should not exist according to the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) galaxies .",
    "@xcite concluded that there exists a population of red quasars that at that time had not been discovered .",
    "@xcite investigated this possibility using a simple model of lbqs selection effects , and demonstrated that the lbqs was biased against the detection of red quasars .",
    "the bias was caused by the blue magnitude limit of the lbqs , because in a blue - flux limited survey , red quasars need to be intrinsically brighter than blue quasars to be detected @xcite .",
    "the bias causes fewer red quasar detections , because the luminosity function of quasars is steep at the bright end @xcite .",
    "other surveys with a blue - flux limit are similarly biassed , independent of the quasar selection method . using their simple model",
    ", @xcite estimated that the red quasars missed by previous surveys constitute as much as 80% of all quasars .",
    "red quasars are defined by a colour criterion .",
    "the best colour to use for this criterion is that made from filters separated by the largest wavelength range possible , because anomalously redder quasar colours stand out more . for the datasets used in this paper ,",
    "the colour covering the largest wavelength range is @xmath4 .",
    "we used the next largest colour @xmath0 , as far more objects , @xmath5 3 times as many , have a measured @xmath0 colour compared to the number with a measured @xmath4 colour .",
    "the additional advantage of having used @xmath0 is that it is possible to compare the colours of the quasar sample presented here with the @xmath3 colour used in @xcite and the @xmath6 colour of @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we define a red quasar by the criterion , @xmath7 3.5 @xcite , because when describing the optical - infrared region of quasar spectra with a power - law , @xmath8 , this colour corresponds to an effective optical - infrared spectral index of @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of red quasars , other than in radio - selected quasar samples , over most of the @xmath0 colour range of the phjfs quasars , satisfying the above criterion , has already been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the @xcite red quasar sample contains the reddest quasars found , with @xmath3 colours of @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite found red quasars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss)@xcite , and @xcite found them in a combination of the 2-micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) @xcite and an automatic plate measuring catalogue ( apmcat ) of poss / ukst sky survey plates @xcite .    despite confirming the existence of red quasars , current observations",
    "have not explained the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for their existence .",
    "dust obscuration by dust at the quasar redshift , in either the host galaxy or the quasar accretion disk @xcite , was the first mechanism proposed for quasar reddening .",
    "@xcite proposed this mechanism as a correlation between @xmath3 colour and redshift was not observed .",
    "the result of reddening a composite optically selected quasar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with dust at the quasar redshift , was found to be consistent with the dust mechanism , because the reddening resulted in the sed of a red phjfs quasar @xcite .    as an alternative",
    ", @xcite suggested that the @xmath3 spread in the @xcite sample is partly or entirely caused by host galaxy starlight .",
    "quasars with flat - radio - spectra are typically hosted by later galaxy types @xcite , and the old stellar population of late type galaxies is a stronger emitter in k than b , reddening quasars @xcite .",
    "an analysis in @xcite of the host galaxy contribution to the red @xmath3 colours of the phjfs quasars in @xcite was inconclusive , but suggested host galaxy contribution was insufficient to cause the red @xmath3 colours observed .",
    "further work in @xcite confirmed that host galaxy starlight can definitely redden quasars , particularly low luminosity and low redshift resolved quasars .",
    "in accordance with @xcite , in this paper we use the criteria that luminous unresolved quasars , which are not located at low redshift , are unlikely to be reddened by host galaxy contribution .    alternatively , @xcite proposed that a synchrotron component of quasar emission created a k - band excess , reddening quasars .",
    "an analysis of 157 phjfs quasars and 12 lbqs quasars found the shape of the seds was consistent with both line - of - sight dust and synchrotron emission mechanisms @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was suggested that because any synchrotron component to quasar emission is weaker in radio - quiet quasars than in radio - loud quasars , any synchrotron emission will only contribute to a small fraction of any reddening .",
    "based on the quasar sample contained therein , @xcite suggested that any radio - quiet quasar redder than @xmath7 3.7 is too red to be the result of synchrotron emission , and is most likely the result of dust obscuration . throughout this paper",
    "we use the criterion that any red quasar that is also radio - quiet , is unlikely to be reddened by synchrotron emission .",
    "finally , @xcite suggested that a small subset of red quasars was caused by the lensing of a quasar by a dusty galaxy .",
    "not only does the dust in the lens redden the quasar but the dusty galaxy potentially magnifies the host galaxy starlight contribution @xcite .",
    "this last mechanism was proposed after @xcite observed a similar phenomenon to @xcite ; with radio - selected lenses having redder colours than optically selected lenses .",
    "whichever mechanism creates red quasars , they are possibly an evolutionary stage . after observing low - ionisation broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars",
    ", @xcite suggested a model of quasar evolution where a quasar occupies a thick dusty torus after forming , eventually the torus dissipates leaving behind an optically blue quasar .",
    "alternately , quasars may emerge from dusty starburst galaxies , residing in the dust stirred up by mergers @xcite .",
    "either evolutionary sequence would naturally create a situation where quasars are reddened by dust at the quasar redshift .",
    "a third evolutionary path has been proposed where red quasars are an evolutionary link between ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and optically selected quasars .",
    "determining the fraction of red quasars and any dependence on redshift , luminosity , radio flux , etc . will indicate if red quasars are an evolutionary stage , and which evolutionary path red quasars belong to .    depending on the mechanism , red quasars might explain the quasar contribution to the x - ray background ( xrb ) . using a theoretical model , @xcite showed that a ratio of two to three times as many dust obscured to unobscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) galaxies can adequately account for the existence of the xrb .",
    "the model also accounts for the observed spectrum and the source counts in the soft and hard x - ray bands .",
    "the latest theoretical models of the xrb require a smaller ratio , lying somewhere between 0.6 to 1.5 .",
    "if it can be shown that red quasars are the result of dust obscuration , and that the red quasar fraction is within 37.5% to 60% , then red quasars are the most probable source of the quasar contribution to the xrb .",
    "the existence of red quasars has various implications , the main one is that it can no longer be assumed that existing quasar samples are representative of the entire quasar population .",
    "the statistics of a sample reflects the properties of the sub - set of a population from which the sample is drawn , previous quasar samples , such as the lbqs , are biassed to the inclusion of blue quasars ; therefore , the statistics of such samples predominantly reflects the blue quasar population .",
    "use of existing quasar datasets requiring a sample that is representative of the entire quasar population is therefore subject to review .",
    "direct examples of this are that the luminosity function of quasars and the change in number density with redshift need to be re - evaluated while including red quasars .    in order to learn more about red quasars",
    ", we need to spectroscopically observe quasars over their entire colour range . to achieve this , future surveys will have to select quasar candidates for spectroscopic follow - up using a technique that is not biased against either red or blue quasars .",
    "one candidate for a suitable selection technique is the kx method , developed in @xcite .",
    "the kx method utilises the power - law nature of quasar seds at long wavelengths combined with morphological classification .",
    "stars experience a turnover in their sed in h - band while quasars follow a power - law , allowing discrimination between stars and quasars .",
    "the stellar morphology of quasars discriminates between quasars and galaxies .",
    "observationally , this requires constructing a colour - colour plot of all objects with a stellar morphology , using an optical colour and a colour that straddles the h - band .    in this paper",
    "we explore regions of the quasar colour - redshift space unavailable in previous work , and test a kx method variant .",
    "we aim to find the boundaries of the quasar colour - redshift parameter space that is occupied . in doing so",
    ", we will improve the estimate of the red quasar fraction and possibly shed light on the mechanism that creates red quasars .",
    "in testing a kx method variant , we intend to verify if it is a viable method of selecting quasars , without bias , from the entire quasar colour - redshift parameter space .",
    "we intend to apply a kx method variant to our quasar sample , and then contrast it with established methods of selecting potential quasars for spectroscopic follow - up .    to achieve these goals",
    "we use a sub - sample of the quasars identified in the fornax cluster spectroscopic survey ( fcss ) , a spectroscopic survey of all extended objects to @xmath11 and point sources to @xmath12 .",
    "the sub - sample consists of all quasars that match to an object in ks - band imaging to a depth of k = 18.4 , obtained using the infrared imager and spectrograph 2 ( iris2 ) instrument on the 3.92-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the ks - band imaging is deeper than 2mass allowing us to explore parts of the @xmath0 colour space unavailable in @xcite , which was limited to @xmath7 5 by the k = 14.5 magnitude limit of 2mass .",
    "furthermore , the quasar sample used covers a larger range of redshift than was examined in @xcite , which were limited to z @xmath13 2.2 . because the fcss used no selection criteria , our quasar sample is bias free , and ideal for testing the ability of the kx method to select quasars from a k magnitude limited survey .",
    "additionally , most of the fcss objects have a u magnitude as well as a @xmath14 magnitude , allowing the kx method to be directly contrasted with traditional methods for optically selecting quasars .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ data ] the datasets used in this paper are described .",
    "section [ redquasars ] details the detection of red quasars in the quasar sample and an analysis of the quasar sample .",
    "this analysis involves a comparison of the @xmath0 colours of the sample quasars to lbqs quasars and a determination of the effect of our selection on the quasar sample constructed here .",
    "section [ redquasars ] concludes with the calculation of the fraction of red quasars .",
    "the effectiveness of the kx method is assessed in section [ testkx ] and following this are our conclusions in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "the sample of quasars used here and their photometric information were obtained by combining three datasets .",
    "astrometry and optical photometry were obtained from the automatic plate measuring catalogue ( apmcat ) of poss / ukst sky survey plates @xcite .",
    "iris2 imaging was used to obtain the k - band photometry used here .",
    "the necessary spectroscopic identifications were provided by the fornax cluster spectroscopic survey ( fcss ) catalogue of .",
    "the datasets were combined by independently matching the astrometry of k - band catalogue objects and fcss objects to that of apmcat catalogue objects . in the rest of this section , we describe the datasets in more detail .    the fcss catalogue is a blind spectroscopic survey of fornax objects in the apmcat catalogue .",
    "the fcss is an ideal source of spectroscopic identifications because the lack of target selection precludes biasing . in the fcss ,",
    "spectroscopy was carried out on all extended sources to @xmath15 and all point sources to @xmath16 .",
    "not every source was spectroscopically observed , and the fraction of observed sources is referred to as the spectroscopic completeness .",
    "the fcss obtained a redshift and spectroscopic identification for more than 90% of the objects observed , referred to as the redshift completeness . in most cases",
    "where a spectroscopic identification could not be obtained , neither was a redshift because of the poor spectrum quality . because the redshift completeness was consistently high for the entire fcss",
    ", we have combined the redshift completeness with the spectroscopic completeness , and throughout the paper the term ` completeness ' refers to this combination .",
    "the completeness of the fcss is 96% for @xmath17 , 82% for @xmath18 and 36% for @xmath19 sources .",
    "we account for the completeness by appropriately weighting quasars during our analysis in later sections .",
    "iris2 was used in december 2001 to obtain ks - band imaging using 60s exposures .",
    "the raw data were processed using the observatory reduction and acquisition control project - data reduction pipeline ( orac - dr ) outlined in @xcite .",
    "the reduced iris2 imaging dataset was then analysed with sextractor to obtain a photometric catalogue of corrected isophotal magnitudes .",
    "corrected isophotal magnitudes were used instead of psf or small aperture magntiudes , because psf and small aperture magnitudes minimise any possible extended contribution to the flux of sources in the iris2 imaging .",
    "the ks - band catalogue magnitude zero - point was then calibrated , by matching point sources in the ks - band catalogue to the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "calibrating also facilitated the conversion from ks magnitudes to the k - band magnitudes used throughout this paper .",
    "after calibration , the magnitude limit of the k - band photometry was found to be 18.4 magnitudes .    in the fcss , quasars were spectroscopically identified as objects with broad permitted lines with a measured full width half - maximum @xmath20 1100 km @xmath21 @xcite . after matching the iris2 imaging catalogues and the fcss quasar identifications to the apmcat object positions using blind matching , to a radius of 10 \" ; a catalogue of all the necessary photometry was created , and all quasars within both the iris2 imaging k magnitude limit , and the fcss spectroscopic identifications @xmath14 magnitude limit were identified .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 69 spectroscopically identified quasars with u , @xmath14 and k magnitudes .",
    "all 69 of these quasars are apmcat point sources ; therefore , our quasar sample is limited to @xmath2 and @xmath16 . of these 69 quasars ,",
    "62 have an r magnitude as required by our kx method variant .",
    "the missing r magnitudes are caused by the different magnitude limits in the @xmath14 and r bands of the apmcat catalogue , 22.5 and 21 magnitudes respectively .",
    "combining the apmcat , iris2 imaging and fcss datasets resulted in a sample of 69 spectroscopically identified quasars . in section [ detection ]",
    "we examine the @xmath0 colours of the quasars to determine which quasars are red .",
    "we investigate the uncertainties in the data to ascertain if the uncertainties caused blue quasars to appear red .",
    "section [ comparison ] compares the colours of the constructed quasar sample to the colours of a sub - set of lbqs quasars to characterise the ` reddness ' of the quasar sample .",
    "then in section [ selection ] , we examine selection effects and estimate the red quasar fraction . finally , section [ relativebjmk ] examines the relative @xmath22 colours of our quasar sample , and compares them to the relative colours of the lbqs sub - set .",

    "these red quasars have colours , 3.5 @xmath25 5.6 , which occupy the colour space between @xcite red quasars and lbqs , sdss red quasars . using the all - sky optical catalogue of radio / x - ray sources in",

    "we found that 5 of these quasars had no radio - counterpart and the remaining 6 were not in the catalogue , indicating they too are radio - quiet .",
    "we concluded that all of the red quasars in figure [ colourvsmag ] are radio - quiet quasars . in @xcite",

    "as the red quasars found in figure [ colourvsmag ] are all luminous unresolved apmcat sources , and the majority are luminous quasars with @xmath28 in figure [ bjmkvsz ] ; any host galaxy contribution to the @xmath0 colours of the red quasars will be minimal .",
    "if a significant host galaxy contribution was present in the red quasars identified in figure [ colourvsmag ] , then the @xmath0 colours of the red quasars would become increasingly redder as both luminosity and redshift decreased . in figures",
    "[ colourvsmag ] and [ bjmkvsz ] , a clear trend of increasingly red @xmath0 colours with decreasing luminosity and redshift is not apparent .",

    "uncertainty in the @xmath0 colours in figure [ colourvsmag ] has two sources , photometric uncertainties in the @xmath14 and k magnitudes and the effect of quasar variability on multi - epoch observations .",

    "the uncertainty was calculated by sextractor during the data reduction . to account for the effect of quasar variability we estimated the uncertainty in the @xmath14 photometry , due to",
    "it being observed at an earlier epoch to the k band photometry , using the structure function of @xcite , @xmath29 \\delta t_{obs}^{0.18 } ( 1 + z)\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the time difference between the multi - epoch observations in the observed frame . in doing this",
    "we effectively move the @xmath14 photometry to the epoch of the k photometry .",
    "to evaluate the structure function we used @xmath31 25 years and calculated the absolute @xmath14 magnitudes using @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 km @xmath21 @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath0 colour uncertainties in figure [ colourvsmag ] are the combination of the photometric uncertainties and the structure function result in quadrature . based on figure [ colourvsmag ] , some of the red quasars found here are potentially blue quasars , that appeared red because of uncertainties in their @xmath0 colours .",
    ".completeness limits and associated weighting applied to a quasar as a function of @xmath14 magnitude . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the argument for the use of the kx method in detecting quasars is not that it finds red quasars ; but that it is relatively bias free in its selection of quasars , whether red or blue .",
    "we experimentally tested this argument by comparing figures [ uvx ] and [ multiplot ] to figure [ uonlykx ] .",
    "figure [ uvx ] is a standard @xmath37 vs. @xmath14 colour - magnitude plot used in selecting quasars in the uvx approach .",

    "we examined this quantitatively by measuring the percentage of quasars in our sample that would not be selected by the uvx and 2qz multi - color methods , in total and as a function of colour , and compared this to our kx method variant . in figure [ uvx ]",

    "3 ( 10 ) of 11 ( 58 ) red ( blue ) quasars were not selected .",
    "the uvx method failed to select 27% of the red quasars compared to 17% of the blue quasars . in figure [ multiplot ]",
    "we applied the selection criterion used in the 2qz @xcite , the criterion is marked by a dashed line and objects below or to the left of the line were selected as quasars .",

    "our example selection criterion fails to select 7 quasars , 1 red and 6 blue , corresponding to 10% of all the quasars and 9% and 10% of the red and blue quasars respectively . as we knew where the quasars were located on the colour - colour plot before defining a suitable colour - based selection criterion ; comparing the results of our example kx method selection criterion to the results of the uvx and 2qz methods is potentially an unfair comparison . as an alternative",
    ", we used the proximity to the stellar locus as a selection criterion i.e. whether a quasar was obscured by the stellar locus .",
    "in figure [ uonlykx ] , 7 quasars were clearly obscured by the stellar locus , 1 red and 6 blue .",
    "this corresponds to 10% of all the quasars and 9% of both the red and blue quasars . comparing all these percentages we found that the kx method variant was quantitatively superior to the uvx method , as the uvx method selected less quasars and was clearly biassed towards the selection of blue quasars .",
    "we also found that quantitatively the kx method variant is comparable to the 2qz multicolour method in the number of quasars selected ; however , the kx method variant is superior as the 2qz multicolour did demonstrate a bias towards the selection of blue quasars while the kx method variant did not .",
    "our results are strong experimental support that compared to existing methods such as the uvx and 2qz multicolor methods , the kx method , and in particular our variant , is ideal for selecting quasar candidates for spectroscopic follow - up , independent of quasar colour .",
    "the key to this result is that the lines of constant @xmath0 in figure [ uonlykx ] cut through the stellar locus almost perpendicularly ; therefore , quasar @xmath0 colour does not affect the likelihood of quasar selection using our kx method variant .",
    "in this paper , we constructed a sample of 69 quasars with measured @xmath0 colours , using a combination of apmcat , iris2 imaging and fcss spectroscopic identifications .",
    "11 of these quasars are red , satisfying @xmath40 3.5 , and all of these red quasars are radio - quiet according to the all sky optical catalogue of radio / x - ray sources . in accordance with @xcite and @xcite , as the 11 red quasars found here are unresolved , luminous and radio - quiet sources predominantly located at @xmath28 , this strongly indicates that the main cause of the red @xmath0 colours is dust at the quasar redshift . comparing our quasar sample to lbqs quasars",

    "as red quasars are observed up to this colour limit , we concluded that the true @xmath0 distribution of quasars is even broader and redder than observed here . from the observed @xmath0 colour distribution",
    ", we robustly constrained the red quasar fraction of the @xmath2 quasar population to be greater than 22% , and from a model estimated it to be 31% .    using the quasar sample constructed here ,",

    "the kx method variant was found to be as effective in the number of quasars it selected ; however , it was superior at selecting quasars independent of colour . for those reasons",

    "<S> we present an investigation of quasar colour - redshift parameter space in order to search for radio - quiet red quasars and to test the ability of a variant of the kx quasar selection method to detect quasars over a full range of colour without bias . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by combining iris2 imaging with the complete fornax cluster spectroscopic survey to probe parameter space unavailable to other surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a new sample of 69 quasars with measured @xmath0 colours . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the colour distribution of these quasars is significantly different from that of the large bright quasar survey s quasars at a 99.9% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> we find 11 of our sample of 69 quasars have signifcantly red colours ( @xmath1 ) and from this , we estimate the red quasar fraction of the @xmath2 quasar population to be 31% , and robustly constrain it to be at least 22% . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the kx method variant used here is more effective than the uvx selection method , and has less colour bias than optical colour - colour selection methods .    </S>",
