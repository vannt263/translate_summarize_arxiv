    "the reaction @xmath21 was measured at @xmath22 using the proton beam from the cooler synchrotron cosy , the magnetic spectrograph big karl @xcite and a 1.0  cm thick liquid hydrogen target ( see fig .  [ bigkarl ] ) .",
    "the momentum of the incoming proton beam was 2.735  gev / c corresponding to a kinetic energy of 1.953  gev .",
    "the scattered particles in the momentum range 930 - 1110  mev/@xmath23 were detected in the focal plane using two stacks of multiwire drift chambers , two threshold cherenkov detectors @xcite , and two scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "the absolute beam momentum was found by measuring simultaneously the tracks of @xmath24 particles and deuterons from the reactions @xmath21 and @xmath25 at fixed big karl momentum 1070  mev/@xmath23 and fitting the kinematic parameters .",
    "the absolute precision of the beam momentum was 0.15  mev/@xmath23 .",
    "the ratio of beam momentum to scattered particle momentum allowed for a measurement at @xmath22 . in the first dipole magnet of big karl the beam",
    "was magnetically separated from the scattered particles and guided through the side exit of the outer yoke into the beam dump .",
    "thus , the huge background from dumping the beam within the spectrometer was avoided .",
    "particle identification was performed using the energy loss ( @xmath26 ) and time of flight ( tof ) information from the scintillator hodoscopes .",
    "in addition two threshold cherenkov detectors @xcite were used in order to achieve a very high pion suppression factor of @xmath27 .",
    "the momentum of the kaon was measured and the missing - mass of the @xmath3 system was deduced . in order to cover the missing - mass range 2050  2110  mev the data were taken using three overlapping settings of the spectrograph ( mean momenta : 1070 , 1010 and 960  mev/@xmath23 ) . the incoming beam was not changed during those measurements .",
    "the relative precision of the momenta of the three settings was 0.1 mev/@xmath23 .",
    "acceptance corrections with respect to solid angle and momentum were taken from monte carlo calculations .",
    "the acceptance correction functions contained the magnetic spectrograph momentum acceptance around @xmath22 with cuts on the horizontal emission angle @xmath28 and the vertical emission angle @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 transversal momentum components and @xmath32 the longitudinal component .",
    "the cuts for a given missing - mass bin corresponded to the measured solid angle @xmath33 .",
    "they contained also the detector efficiency corrections .",
    "the detector efficiency included efficiency of scintillator detectors which determined trigger and particle identification and magnetic spectrograph efficiency with field inhomogeneity at the edges of the acceptance .",
    "acceptance corrections as determined by monte carlo simulations were checked by use of experimental distributions of simultaneously measured pions .",
    "they are shown in fig .",

    "the acceptance correction function of the 960  mev/@xmath23 setting looks different due to a slightly different @xmath34 and @xmath35 cut .",

    "the relative normalization errors due to the luminosity measurement were negligibly small .",
    "the relative normalization errors due to the acceptance corrections were estimated to be less than 2  % .",
    "the absolute cross section normalization was determined by measuring the luminosity as described in @xcite . at the beginning of each beam period",
    "we calibrated two luminosity monitors counting the left and right scattered particles from the target as function of the number of beam particles . to this end , the beam current was highly reduced in order to count the beam particles individually with a fast scintillator hodoscope in the beam dump . for the calibration , the dependence of the luminosity signal on the beam intensity was fitted by a linear function .",
    "the resulting beam intensity error amounted to about 5  % .",
    "the density of the bubble - free liquid hydrogen target ( @xmath36  g/@xmath37 ) with 1  @xmath38 m thick mylar foil windows was kept constant by stabilizing the temperature to @xmath39  k using a high - precision temperature control @xcite .",
    "the target thickness , i.e. the distance between entrance and exit window ( nominal 1  cm ) was precisely measured with a calibrated optical telescope .",
    "the target thickness error was about 5  % .",
    "the overall systematic normalization error was estimated to be 10  % . the missing - mass spectrum is shown in fig .  [ spectrum ] .    in view of the predicted narrow dibaryon resonances in the @xmath40 system",
    "a high missing - mass resolution was required .",
    "the missing - mass resolution depends on the spread of the beam momentum , the beam spot size at the target , the target thickness , the momentum resolution of the magnetic spectrograph and the 1  mev bin width .",
    "the effective resolution function @xmath41 has been deduced in @xcite by a least - square fit to the sharply rising double differential cross section @xmath42 near the @xmath43 threshold , see fig .",
    "[ spectrum ] .",
    "it can be represented by a gaussian density distribution with a standard deviation of @xmath44 mev .",
    "it should be noted that the width @xmath45 depends mainly on the spread of the beam momentum and the 1  mev bin width .",
    "the contributions from the target thickness , the beam spot size at the target ( 3 mm ) and the momentum resolution of the magnetic spectrograph are negligibly small . since the cosy beam has not been changed during the measurements the resolution function @xmath41 is constant in the full range of missing - masses .",
    "concerning the predictions of narrow @xmath4 dibaryon resonances in the @xmath6 system we refer to calculations of aerts and dover @xcite .",
    "they studied the decay width of strangeness @xmath4 six - quark bag states predicted by the nijmegen group @xcite on the basis of the mit bag model .",
    "the predicted @xmath9 h - dibaryon with quark structure @xmath8 is the strongest bound dibaryon state @xcite . in case of @xmath4 states",
    "the color - magnetic force is less strong and hence the lowest @xmath8 state is predicted to be about 120 mev above the @xmath46 threshold @xcite .",
    "the lowest - lying @xmath4 resonances exhibit a quark cluster structure @xmath47 .",
    "the singlet state @xmath10 ( @xmath48p@xmath49 ) is located at about 55 mev above the @xmath3 threshold , and the triplet states @xmath11 ( @xmath50p@xmath51 ) are located at about 95 mev above the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "this corresponds for the lowest - lying dibaryon @xmath10 to an invariant mass of 2109  mev which is located between the @xmath17-proton and @xmath52-nucleon thresholds .",
    "the resonance @xmath10 is a singlet state of a four quark - two quark cluster configuration @xmath53 with angular momentum @xmath54 , spin @xmath55 , total angular momentum and parity @xmath56 .",
    "the isospin is @xmath57 .",
    "the only particle - decay channel is the @xmath58 wave of the @xmath6 system .",
    "this decay is hindered by the relative @xmath59-wave centrifugal barrier between the two clusters and the stability of the @xmath53 configuration against dissociation into two color singlet ( @xmath60 ) clusters .",
    "in other words , the @xmath6 channel represents only a small piece of the @xmath10 wave function . as a consequence",
    ", the total width @xmath61 of @xmath10 is predicted to be less than about 1  mev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the predicted width depends on the resonance mass @xmath62 , see fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "we note that there is a rather large uncertainty of the predicted resonance masses @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the production of the dibaryon @xmath10 has been studied theoretically in the invariant mass range between 2.06 and 2.10 gev / c@xmath63 @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we consider the invariant mass range between 2.058 and 2.105 gev / c@xmath63 which corresponds to resonance energies @xmath64 between 4 mev and 51 mev .",
    "we deduce from fig .  2 of @xcite @xmath65  kev for @xmath66  mev ( @xmath67 mev ) .",
    "extrapolating to @xmath68  mev ( @xmath69  mev ) yields @xmath70  kev .",
    "we note that these total widths are lower limits .",
    "the decay width calculation involves an integration of the dibaryon wave function over the radial distance @xmath71 .",
    "such integrals are dominated by the contributions from small radii @xmath71 which give a lower limit of @xmath61 . including the larger radii gives an upper limit .",
    "then , the lower limit has to be multiplied by 64/3 to obtain an upper limit .",
    "in addition , the width increases by about a factor of 2 if hulthn rather then oscillator wave functions are used .",
    "thus , an upper limit is obtained if the lower limit is multiplied by a factor 128/3 @xcite .",
    "we get the following ranges for the predicted total width : @xmath72 $ ]  kev for @xmath68  mev ( @xmath69  mev ) and @xmath73 $ ]  kev for @xmath66  mev ( @xmath67  mev ) .",
    "as one can see , the predicted widths depend strongly on the invariant mass of the dibaryon .",
    "we emphasize that a possible resonance @xmath10 below the @xmath74 threshold ( 2128.935 mev ) can only decay into @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , the elastic width @xmath76 can be assumed to be equal to the total width @xmath61 , i.e. @xmath77 .",

    "it is interesting to note that the upper limit of the production cross section @xmath144 is nearly independent of the total width @xmath61 as long as @xmath168 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the integral over the breit - wigner distribution ( [ resonance-2 ] ) is constant ( equal to one ) , that means it does not depend on @xmath61 .",
    "thus , folding a narrow breit - wigner distribution ( [ resonance-2 ] ) with a wider gaussian distribution yields a resonance signal which depends only on the production cross section and the effective resolution width @xmath45 but not on @xmath61 .",
    "this is a great advantage when searching for an extremely narrow resonance .",
    "the sensitivity in the search for a narrow resonance can be increased substantially by increasing the missing - mass resolution , i.e. by decreasing the resolution width @xmath45 .",
    "another less efficient way is to increase the statistical and systematic accuracy .",
    "in contrast to previous experiments , the present experiment exhibits a rather high missing - mass resolution . in previous experiments ,",
    "the missing - mass resolution has been very much lower .",
    "hogan et al .",
    "@xcite studied the reaction @xmath167 at bombarding energies between 2.5 and 3.0 gev and scattering angles @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the momentum resolution of the detected kaons ( @xmath172 ) ranged from 1.5  % at @xmath169 to 3  % at @xmath171 .",
    "the number of data points per mev/@xmath23 and the effective missing - mass resolution was so low that they were not able to see the marked fsi enhancement near the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "reed et al .",
    "@xcite studied the reaction @xmath167 at 2.40 and 2.85 gev and @xmath22 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the momentum resolution of the outgoing kaons at @xmath22 corresponded to @xmath175  % .",
    "this resolution was also too low to search for a narrow resonance with @xmath176  mev .",
    "the same holds true for the exclusive measurements of the reaction @xmath177 by the cosy - tof collaboration @xcite .    as mentioned in the introduction , siebert et al .",
    "@xcite performed the first high - resolution study of the reaction @xmath167 .",
    "sharp peaks in the missing - mass spectra seen there have not been confirmed by the present experiment . in this context",
    "we note that the reaction @xmath167 has been studied @xcite at @xmath178  mev at four scattering angles , 6@xmath179 , 8.3@xmath179 , 10.3@xmath179 , and 12@xmath179 .",
    "the peak near @xmath16 appeared only in the missing - mass spectrum measured at @xmath180 but not at 6@xmath179 , 8.3@xmath179 and 12@xmath179 . at @xmath181  mev",
    ", the interesting missing - mass range has been studied at two scattering angles , 12.6@xmath179 and 20@xmath179 .",
    "the peak near @xmath18 appeared only at @xmath182 but not at 20@xmath179 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the peaks near @xmath16 and @xmath18  mev must be attributed to a statistical fluctuation of the nonresonant cross section .    summarizing ,",
    "the reaction @xmath183 has been measured with a high missing - mass resolution at @xmath1  gev and @xmath2 . a narrow strangeness @xmath4 resonance @xmath10 is not visible in the missing - mass spectrum .",
    "upper limits for the production cross section of @xmath184 have been deduced .",
