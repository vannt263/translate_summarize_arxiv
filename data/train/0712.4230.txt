    "a strong argument in support of this hypothesis comes from the fact that the mass of one of the hvss is @xmath4 ( edelmann et al .",
    "@xcite ) so that this star ends its evolution in a type ii sn leading to the production of a hyperfast ns .",
    "it is believed that the origin of hvss could be connected to scattering processes involving the supermassive black hole ( bh ) in the galactic centre ( hills @xcite ; yu & tremaine @xcite ; gualandris et al .",
    "it is therefore possible that the progenitors of some hyperfast nss were also ejected from the galactic centre .",
    "the proper motion and parallax measured for psr b1508 + 55 , however , indicate that this ns was born in the galactic disk ( chatterjee et al .",
    "the kinematic characteristics of some high - velocity early b stars also suggest that these objects originated in the disk ( e.g. ramspeck et al .",
    "we consider the possibility that the hvss ( including the progenitors of hyperfast nss ) could be ejected not only from the galactic centre but also from the cores of young ( @xmath5 yr ) massive ( @xmath6 ) star clusters ( ymscs ) , located either in the galactic disk or near the galactic centre ( cf .",

    "to check the hypothesis that the hyperfast nss could be the descendants of hvss which were ejected from the cores of ymscs , we calculated ( see gvaramadze et al .",

    "we find that main - sequence o - type stars can not be ejected from ymscs with peculiar velocities high enough to explain the origin of hyperfast nss , but lower mass main - sequence stars or the stripped helium cores of massive stars could be accelerated to hypervelocities .",
    "we find also that the dynamical processes in the cores of ymscs can produce stars moving with velocities of @xmath8 which therefore contribute to the origin of high - velocity nss as well as to the origin of the bound population of halo stars ( ramspeck et al .",
