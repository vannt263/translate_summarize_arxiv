    "with the growing interest in teleporting unknown quantum states through entangled channels , many classes of @xmath0-qubit states have been studied .",
    "a few of these classes , for example the cluster states have been experimentally prepared @xcite .",
    "because of the large space in @xmath0-qubit hilbert space one can always find quantum states which can be good for teleporting a specific kind of unknown states @xcite.the usefulness of these states are further characterized by implementing other protocols , for example the quantum state sharing ( qss)@xcite . though many of the proposals have only a theoretical stand , very few received experimental importance .",
    "the robustness of various classes of @xmath0-qubit entangled states which can perform similar tasks can differ in the presence of noisy environments . in this work",
    ", we propose a scheme for generating @xmath0-qubit entangled channels in quantum dot systems where the coupling between electronic spins ( qubits ) is through the heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "spins of electrons in quantum dots are proposed to be good candidates for quantum computation @xcite . with the state - of - the - art technology in manufacturing and manipulating semiconductor nanostructures , quantum dots",
    "gives the promise for scalable quantum computing @xcite . with a high level of control over the number of electrons@xcite , and the applied external fields ,",
    "desirable initial states can be achieved .",
    "the interaction between any two electronic spins can be controlled by the applied gate voltages @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction induced quantum gates , for example the @xmath4 and @xmath5 gates are implemented at picosecond time scales @xcite .",
    "the nuclear spins on the @xmath6 lattice give the dominant contribution to the decoherence of the electronic spin @xcite .",
    "the time scales for this decay has been experimentally found to be of the order of a few nanoseconds @xcite .",
    "the effect of the spin environment really comes into the picture , either in repetitive usage of the dot , or , when there are large number of operations to be performed with these systems .",
    "the fidelity calculations show that one can perform @xmath7-@xmath8 gate operations before the real loss of spin polarization of the electrons .    in the step towards realizing scalable quantum computers ,",
    "multi - electron quantum dots have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in the past few years ( see for example the review article@xcite ) .",
    "three electron quantum dots arranged in a closed loop structure has been fabricated by vidan _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of multi - electron quantum dots and their usage for quantum computing was discussed thoroughly by hanson _ _ et al.__@xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall use heisenberg exchange interaction between qubits to generate @xmath0-magnon entangled channels for teleporting an unknown quantum state perfectly .",
    "multi - electron quantum dot systems can be a possible realization for the schemes that we propose in generating the desired entangled states .",
    "teleportation of an unknown state through an entangled two - qubit channel proposed by bennett _ _ et al.__@xcite has been demonstrated using entangled photons @xcite , atomic states @xcite , spin states in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and other solid state systems @xcite .",
    "the usage of multi - particle entangled states for implementing a similar protocol was studied initially using three and four qubit @xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-qubit @xmath9 states , @xmath10 states form another class of entangled states , and are well studied for their high symmetry .",
    "@xmath10 states can be generated from any @xmath0-qubit interactions which conserve the @xmath11 component of the total spin of qubits .",
    "the symmetric three qubit @xmath10 state,@xmath12 $ ] fails to teleport the unknown state perfectly to bob . in this connection , agarwal and pati _",
    "_ @xcite have proposed a modification of the @xmath10 state which can teleport the unknown state perfectly .",
    "though these states can teleport single qubits perfectly , they can not be used for quantum state sharing .",
    "later it was shown that the modified @xmath10 states can be connected to @xmath9 states by performing entangling operations on any two qubits @xcite .",
    "since alice is in possession of two qubits , depending on the task given to her she can either use her two qubits to teleport one qubit perfectly , or can perform appropriate unitary transformations on her qubits ( converting it to @xmath9 state ) and use it for quantum state sharing by giving one of her qubits to charlie @xcite .",
    "thus the modified @xmath10 state can be a key source for quantum protocols as different tasks can be performed in accordance with the requirement .",
    "this state has been subject to extensive study in the past few years .",
    "proposals using cavity qed experiments for generating these states have been given @xcite .",
    "considering the importance of these states , we propose an experimental way of generating these states using exchange interaction between the qubits in quantum dot systems , and further generalize to @xmath0 qubits .",
    "let us consider a @xmath13-qubit state which is an eigen state of the total @xmath14 operator given by , @xmath15 .",
    "if one of the qubits , say the last one is given to bob , and the other two are in alice s possession , then , alice can perfectly teleport a one qubit state @xmath16 to bob when the coefficients satisfy the following relation given by , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where , @xmath20 and similarly , @xmath21 . on the contrary , if bob is given the first qubit in the state @xmath22 , then for perfect teleportation , @xmath23 and @xmath24 for each qubit is responsible for such conditions . to overcome these imbalances , one can construct a @xmath10-like state , @xmath25 , and hence becomes difficult to generate using simple interactions .",
    "the three qubit exchange interaction can be described by the following hamiltonian , @xmath29 where , @xmath1 is the strength of the interaction .",
    "the exchange interaction is typically of the order of @xmath30 in strongly interacting systems .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 determines the closeness of the @xmath13-qubit chain .",
    "if @xmath27 , this is a perfectly closed chain and for @xmath28 , it is an open chain .",
    "we shall show how different kinds of @xmath22 states can be generated by varying this parameter @xmath31",
    ".    the above hamiltonian can be straight forwardly diagonalized , and the time evolution of various @xmath13-qubit states can be found .",
    "since we are interested only in one magnon states , we shall start with an initial @xmath13-qubit state , @xmath32 .",
    "since the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "conserves the @xmath11 component of the total spin , i.e. , @xmath33=0 $ ] where , @xmath34 , the state at a later time will be @xmath35 where the time dependent coefficients are given by    @xmath36 , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "( [ eq : nl ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry parameter @xmath31 is varied from @xmath39 ( open ) to @xmath40 ( perfectly closed ) .",
    "the times at which one can find solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nl ] ) increases with decreasing @xmath31 .",
    ", width=302 ]    one can now extract the times for which the above equation is satisfied .",
    "if the interaction between the qubits is switched off at those times , the three qubit state obtained will be the one which can be used as a perfect teleportation channel .",
    "the question of how exactly can one switch off the interaction depends on further details of the experiment which we do not discuss here . finding the roots for the non - linear equation given in eq .",
    "is in general non - trivial for arbitrary values of @xmath31 . for the case of open and closed chains",
    ", one can find the roots to the above equation .    for perfectly closed chains corresponding to @xmath27 , eq . yields",
    "the solution which has a periodicity of @xmath41 , given by @xmath42 in addition to this one also finds that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , at the above given time .",
    "the three qubit state at the above given time is simply given by , @xmath45,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 $ ] , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "other than the phases @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the above state is given by pati _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "since we are interested to give the first qubit to bob , we have started with the initial state @xmath51 . instead , if the last qubit have to be given to bob , we would have stated with the initial state @xmath52 . the solutions to eq . for other values",
    "@xmath31 can be seen from fig.2 . as @xmath31 decreases from one to zero , the time scale shifts towards higher values .",
    "although the times for which the solution exists changes with @xmath31 , the probability of finding the state in @xmath51 is still one half i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "hence for any value of @xmath31 one can still write the final three qubit state when the condition given in eq .",
    "@xmath54 is satisfied , as @xmath55.\\ ] ]      in this section we shall consider the case of a @xmath0 qubit entangled channel having one magnon excitation . in teleporting a single qubit , states with at least one magnon excitation are required . to construct a @xmath56 magnon state ,",
    "first consider the ground state of the @xmath0 qubit system to be @xmath57 and now flip @xmath56 spins at various sites .",
    "this can be in done in @xmath58 ways .",
    "now the linear superposition of all such states represent a @xmath56 magnon state given by @xmath59 . in the above",
    "@xmath60 represents the @xmath0 qubit state with spins flipped at positions @xmath61 .",
    "we shall consider all the complex coefficients to be some phase factors only .",
    "for @xmath62 the above state becomes @xmath63 and for @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath66 state is just the mirror reflection of the state @xmath67 . for two magnon excitations",
    "the state must at least consist of @xmath68 qubits .    since we are interested to teleport the information of a single qubit we shall give one qubit to bob and keep the remaining @xmath69 qubits with alice .",
    "the initial state of the total system is given by @xmath70 .",
    "we shall rewrite the initial state such that alice s qubits and bob qubit gets factorized into four different products , given by @xmath71 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for",
    "perfect teleportation alice should perform a measurement on a orthonormal basis which would imply that the states @xmath76 and @xmath76 should be mutually orthogonal .",
    "this immediately imposes the condition that @xmath77 considering the complex coefficients @xmath78 to be only phase factors we immediately see that the @xmath0 qubit channel which can teleport a single qubit state is given by latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath107 . in time",
    "the spin operators of each qubit become time - dependent and the state at any later time obtained after tracing out the bath degrees of freedom will have the same form given above , with only the spin operators replaced with their time - dependnet forms , given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 , where @xmath110 are the number of nuclear spins in the @xmath100 quantum dot .    the third particle correlations for example , @xmath111 decay much faster ( with a decay rate @xmath112 ) , in comparison to the two particle correlations , @xmath113 which decay at the rate of @xmath114 .",
    "though the state has lost all its three particle correlations it can be still entangled because of the two particle correlations which decay comparatively slower .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath9 state which has only three particle correlations , becomes completely mixed quickly indicating that the state is not good even for probabilistic teleportation . for the above described environmental interactions the modified @xmath10 states can be quite useful for teleporting unknown states with better fidelity than @xmath9 states .",
    "the time evolution for a general @xmath0 qubit state can be written following the above analysis .",
    "the higher order correlations decay faster , and the multi - qubit states become mixed faster with increasing @xmath0 , thereby decreasing the fidelity of teleportation .",
    "to overcome this situation one needs to develop control schemes where the entanglement of multi - qubit states can be preserved for longer times .    in conclusion",
    "we have shown how exchange interaction among spin-@xmath96 particles can be used to generate a class of multi qubit entangled channels that can be used for teleportation . for times @xmath3 we obtain the @xmath0 qubit entangled state which can be used for teleportation and further for qss under certain conditions . for a typical quantum dot system",
    "this time scale can be of the order of picoseconds . for smaller number of qubits these states",
    "can be generated periodically , whereas for large @xmath0 there exists a unique time where one can obtain such entangled states . in the presence of local decoherence for each qubit",
    "higher order correlations decay faster due to which the modified states show promise for better fidelity than @xmath9 states which have higher order polarizations only .",
