    "approximating the time evolution of a physical system as an adiabatic process , which proceeds through a series of equilibrium states , has been a helpful approach both in classical physics and in quantum mechanics @xcite . in dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) @xcite , which is a framework for describing the nonequilibrium evolution of classical many - body systems , such an adiabatic approximation is employed on the level of the position - dependent one - particle density distribution . thereby the correlations between particle positions are approximated by those of a fictitious equilibrium system with the same one - body density profile as the nonequilibrium system of interest @xcite .",
    "this substitution implies the assumption that the relaxation time of particle correlations is short compared to the time scale of the processes of interest .",
    "however , this assumption is not justified , e.g. , for strongly confined systems , which leads to a failure of ddft in those cases @xcite . in order to accurately describe the dynamics of such systems , superadiabatic forces need to be included . in recent work fortini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed a computational scheme for systematically dividing internal forces in a system of brownian particles into an adiabatic and a superadiabatic contribution . by applying their method to a system of confined hard rods in one dimension , which is a common model system @xcite for studying dynamical features",
    ", these authors found that the superadiabatic part of the force in that system is not a small correction and can not easily be related to the adiabatic part .",
    "furthermore the results depended sensitively on the chosen initial condition .",
    "the behavior of these superadiabatic forces is at present not well understood .    in order to gain more insight into the splitting into adiabatic and superadiabatic forces we apply the simulation scheme of fortini _ et al .",
    "_  to a one - dimensional system that is qualitatively different from hard rods .",
    "we choose the pair potential of the gaussian core model ( gcm ) @xcite , which constitutes an approximation to the effective interactions of polymer coils .",
    "we investigate the superadiabatic forces and their temperature dependence .",
    "we start either from an equilibrium initial state , for which the strength of an external parabolic potential is instantaneously altered in order to drive the time evolution , or from a range of nonequilibrium initial states , in which the particles are located with equidistant separations . in both cases",
    "we apply a parabolic external potential for confinement .",
    "our motivation for studying a one - dimensional system stems from similar studies of equilibrium systems , for , e.g. , colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite or non - additive hard core mixtures @xcite , where exact solutions are possible in one - dimension .",

    "the authors developed a theory for the dynamics of the two - body density , based on the equilibrium factorization of the three - body density , that yields results superior to those from ddft .",
    "for the gcm we find that the magnitude of the superadiabatic contribution to the total force depends sensitively on the initial state of the system .",
    "this echoes the observations for the system of hard rods , where this dependence was also found to be strong @xcite .",
    "if the time evolution starts from an equilibrium state , the adiabatic approximation remains accurate during the nonequilibrium time evolution , which confirms the validity of ddft in this situation .",
    "however , for equidistant initial particle locations we find large superadiabatic forces , which are out - of - phase with respect to the adiabatic force and tend to grow with temperature .",
    "we identify the occupation of density peaks , which in reality correspond to individual particles , by multiple particles @xcite to be one of the reasons for the occurrence of these superadiabatic forces .",

    "these authors also included three- and higher - body interactions , which are not of interest for the current work .",
    "we will therefore restrict ourselves to pair interactions of the form ( [ eq : potential ] ) . as a result of the integration one obtains the continuity equation , @xmath28 where the one - body current",

    "the mean - field force density provides a very good approximation to the adiabatic and to the total force density .",
    "for @xmath162 the total internal force density @xmath142 and the superadiabatic force density @xmath141 at @xmath148 are scaled versions of the respective force densities at @xmath111 ; cf .",

    "for the lower temperature @xmath143 and @xmath142 oscillate in phase with each other and have a similar amplitude .",

    "curves are shifted upwards by @xmath191 units for clarity .",
    "note that the magnitude of the different results is similar . ]    finally , it is remarkable that for all initial separations , ranging from @xmath158 to @xmath163 , the superadiabatic force density @xmath141 remains of the same order of magnitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : supadcry ] .",
    "in contrast , the total internal force density @xmath142 decreases by roughly two orders of magnitude over the range of @xmath73 considered .",
    "this is most striking for the larger separations between @xmath192 and @xmath163 , where the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath141 remains approximately the same .",
    "this decrease in the total force density for higher separations @xmath73 can be rationalized by the fact that in the nonequilibrium system the interaction is weakened by greater distance between the particles , both directly through the spatial dependence of the gcm force and indirectly , because particles take more time to come near to each other .",
    "the probability of multiple occupancy of a potential well in the adiabatic system , however , is not decreased by greater distance between the wells .",
    "therefore , the superadiabatic force density , which corrects the additional force density from multiple occupation , stays roughly of the same magnitude .",
    "we have investigated the splitting into adiabatic and superadiabatic contributions of the internal force density in the one - dimensional gcm for equilibrated initial states as well as for a range of nonequilibrium initial states . for this purpose",

    "the magnitude of the superadiabatic force density and thus the validity of the adiabatic approximation in ddft depends strongly on the initial conditions that one considers .",
    "we have found that if the system is initially equilibrated in an external parabolic potential , then the superadiabatic contribution to the force density can be regarded as a small correction .",
    "hence , in this case the adiabatic approximation is justified .",
    "we have found this behavior , independent of temperature in the examined temperature range .    for equidistant initial configurations we have found large superadiabatic contributions to the internal force density at high temperature .",
    "we have identified the primary source of these contributions as multiple occupancy of wells in the adiabatic potential .",
    "if multiple particles occupy the same well , they exert forces on each other which cause the adiabatic force density @xmath143 to oscillate out - of - phase with the total internal force density @xmath130 .",
    "this results in a large superadiabatic contribution .",
    "this mechanism is less efficient at smaller temperatures . since multiple occupancy",
    "does not depend on the exact form of the pair potential , we expect qualitatively similar results for pair interactions other than the gcm .",
    "our findings are entirely consistent with those by reinhardt and brader @xcite who found unphysical self - interactions of the tagged particle density fields creates an excessively fast relaxation predicted by ddft .    for both equilibrated initial states and small separations in the equidistant initial states we observed dynamical mean - field behavior @xcite . in these cases",
    "the superadiabatic force was small .",
    "however , we also found cases where the mean - field approximation was good in equilibrium , but not in the nonequilibrium system . hence the precise relationship between the mean - field force and the adiabatic and superadiabatic forces is complex , except in special cases . while we tried to choose conditions which allow the study of the most relevant effects , the superadiabatic part might behave unexpectedly for other initial states , which remains to be explored .",
