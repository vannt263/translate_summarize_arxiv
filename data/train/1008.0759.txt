    "the x - ray flare of am her decayed with a time scale of @xmath142 3700 sec , and the x - ray spectra was well reproduced by the thermal plasma model with the average temperature of @xmath143 kev ( table [ tbl : spec_flare ] ) and the volume emission measure ( vem ) of @xmath144 @xmath145 . in this section , we discuss on a rough estimation of plasma parameters during the flare , i.e. , the electron density , @xmath146 , and the plasma size ( or the shock height of the plasma , @xmath147 ) , by using three observational values of @xmath148 and vem .",
    "first , from the observational parameter of @xmath53 , we can estimate the value of @xmath147 , if we assume the flare time scale ( @xmath53 ) is mainly determined by the cooling time scale of the plasma , @xmath149",
    ". this assumption may be correct because the temperature seemed to be gradually decreased through the flare as seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : flare_lc ] . according to aizu ( 1973 ) , the shock height is numerically described as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a shock velocity of the plasma , which is about @xmath152 cm s@xmath29 on a typical gravitational potential of a wd in a strong shock case , as @xmath153 thus , we get @xmath154 this value is quite large in the binary system of am her compared to the binary distance , @xmath155 , which is calculated by the third law of kepler as @xmath156 where @xmath157 the mass of the companion star @xcite and @xmath158 is the orbital period of the binary . in other words , this solution requires that the binary space is fully filled with the plasma , and it is unphysical .",
    "therefore , the cooling time scale should be shorter than the flare time scale ( i.e. , @xmath159 ) and @xmath53 is just described by a time scale of the accretion onto the wd from the companion star .",
    "this statement is supported by the observational fact seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare_lc ] top ; the x - ray flux became faint during the epoch corresponding to the dim phase in quiescence , and thus the flare phenomenon occurs near the magnetic pole on the wd surface .",
    "second , from the observational parameter of @xmath160 , we can constrain values of @xmath146 and @xmath147 , under the condition that @xmath149 is not limited by @xmath53 as discussed above . here , we use @xmath146 as the electron density just below the shock front , and we assume that the maximum temperature obtained with the cemekl model , @xmath85 , represents the shock temperature , @xmath161 , of the multi - color accretion column ; i.e. , we assume @xmath162 . according to @xcite , the cooling of the plasma occurs via free - free emission and cyclotron radiation , and the time scale of the cooling is described as @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the volume - emissivities averaged along the accretion column of the free - free and cyclotron emissions , respectively .",
    "the averaged volume - emissivity of free - free emission are quantitatively described as @xmath166 where @xmath167 is a correction factor of the plasma structure ; when we put @xmath168 as a position from the bottom of the plasma , and the plasma has a vertical dependence of @xmath169 , then @xmath167 is described as @xmath170 .",
    "the cyclotron emissivity @xmath165 is given in equation ( 10 ) of @xcite which depends on @xmath171 . here",
    ", the value @xmath147 was determined by @xmath149 in equation ( [ eq : flare_cool ] ) , which has a dependency with @xmath165 again .",
    "thus , we need to solve the simultaneous equations between @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath147 , and @xmath146 to get self consistent values .",
    "we performed numerical calculations to solve them to derive a rough estimation between @xmath146 and @xmath147 . in the calculation",
    ", we assume the aizu solution ( 1973 ) where the cyclotron cooling was ignored ; i.e. , we assume the relation @xmath172 and set the plasma structure at @xmath173 .",
    "we also ignored the effects of the gradient of the gravitational potential of the wd in the accretion plasma .",
    "the solutions , when the magnetic field strength is a typical value of am her @xmath174 mg @xcite , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare_ne_h ] .     and @xmath146 , based on calculations on @xmath161 with _ suzaku _ during the flare phase of am her in the very low state .",
    "dashed lines show the limitations from vem with assumption of @xmath175 .",
    "see the text . ]    finally , we can use the third observational value , vem , to limit the parameters @xmath147 and @xmath146 . to evaluate the volume of the plasma ,",
    "we assume that the accretion column has a cylinder shape with a radius of @xmath176 , which is @xmath155 times size of the shock height ( i.e. , @xmath177 )",
    ". dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare_ne_h ] represent the limitation from vem values to @xmath147 and @xmath146 in cases of @xmath178 , and 16 . in the plot",
    ", we used the vem value from a simple mekal fitting ; since the model assumes uniform density and the plot is shown in the shock density , we multiplied a correction factor of @xmath179 , which is 4 when we assume the aizu solution ( 1973 ) .",
    "as a result , we can get a rough values of @xmath147 and @xmath146 as a function of @xmath155 ; for example , @xmath180 @xmath145 and @xmath181 cm when @xmath182 .",
    "although many solutions are allowed in this estimation , quite small values of @xmath155 are not realistic from fig .",
    "[ fig : flare_ne_h ] ; i.e. , the plasma has a coin - like shape rather than tall - cylinder one .",
    "according to the results of the data analyses in sections [ section : ana_qui_spec ] and [ section : ana_qui_phaseresolved ] , the x - ray spectra of am her during the quiescence can be described either by a multi - color - plasma cemekl model with a temperature of @xmath183 kev , or by a combination of thermal and non - thermal model of mekal with @xmath184 kev plus the pl component . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the nature of the thermal component , whereas non - thermal phenomena in am her will be discussed in the next section [ section : discussion_acceleration ] .",
    "first , we estimated the plasma parameters , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , during the quiescence by performing numerical calculations as already shown in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] .",
    "the vems during the quiescence were one or two order - of - magnitude lower than that in the flare ; vem = @xmath185 @xmath186 ( cemekl ) or @xmath187 @xmath186 ( mekal+pl ) . to obtain the value of @xmath161",
    ", we assumed @xmath162 for cemekl model as in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] .",
    "we can not estimate @xmath161 directly from @xmath160 of mekal model , so we simulated pha spectra from cemekl model with various @xmath85 on xspec and fitted with mekal models to obtain a rough relation between @xmath160 and @xmath85 . in the simulation , we used the xis response on the hxd nominal position and fitted spectra in the hard x - ray band of the xis , 4  10 kev .",
    "then , we got a @xmath85  @xmath160 relation as @xmath188 thus , the value @xmath184 kev by mekal analysis corresponds to @xmath189 kev of the multi - color column . using these vem and @xmath161 values",
    ", we performed the same numerical calculations again as in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] , and got plasma parameters as @xmath190 a few @xmath191 @xmath145 and @xmath181 cm when @xmath182 .",
    "although there remains an uncertainty on the plasma shape @xmath155 , the column height seems to be almost the same order of magnitude as that in flares , and the electron density got one or two order of magnitude lower than in flares .",
    "second , in order to compare the _ suzaku _ results with other past observations in the high , medium , and low states , we plotted @xmath160 and vem values by several x - ray satellites @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : qui_kt_em ] . in this figure ,",
    "the @xmath160 values obtained with mekal models are corrected into @xmath161 equivalents by the @xmath160-@xmath85 relation of equation ( [ eq : kt_cemekl_mekal ] ) .",
    "therefore , observationally , the plasma temperature gets lower as vem gets smaller , and the _ suzaku _ points in the faintest state also follow this trend . hereafter",
    ", we call this relation as the vem - @xmath160 trend .    finally , to interpret the vem - @xmath160 trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : qui_kt_em ] quantitatively , we performed further numerical calculations demonstrated in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qui_kt_em ] , we plotted contours of vem and @xmath160 with various conditions of @xmath155 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 .",
    "the calculations includes the free - free and cyclotron cooling processes with several assumptions described in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] . therefore , the results of calculations suggest that the changes on the plasma parameters occur only on @xmath146 , keeping the column shape almost constant , even when the vem varies by two order of magnitudes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qui_kt_em ] , one realistic set of parameters is @xmath182 and @xmath192 cm , which were already presented as an one possible solution of the flare plasma in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] .",
    "other possibilities are larger @xmath155 at lower @xmath193 cm or smaller @xmath155 at higher @xmath194 cm , but the latter case is less feasible because analytic solutions vanish at small @xmath155 values , as already mentioned in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] . in other words ,",
    "our calculation does not exclude other interpretations that both @xmath146 and the plasma shapes varies as vem changes .     and vem , obtained by x - ray observations of am her @xcite .",
    "lines show relations between @xmath160 and vem by numerical calculations on the various cases of @xmath195 cm , @xmath196 @xmath145 , and @xmath178 .",
    "conditions are shown in the figure . ]",
    "if the plasma shape is constant in various states keeping the same shock height @xmath147 , then the gravitational potentials at the shock front are not changed by its accretion rate .",
    "the variation of @xmath160 as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : qui_kt_em ] may be caused by possible changes of the energy - conversion efficiency @xmath197 at the shock , however , the adiabatic index of the accretion gas is required to be less than 1 to change @xmath197 by factor two or three ; this situation is not realistic .",
    "another possibility is an observational effect ; x - ray observations detect the free - free emissions and thus are essentially sensitive to the dense bottom - part of the column where the plasma is already cooled down mainly by the cyclotron radiation . at lower accretion rate",
    ", the effect will be significant because the cyclotron cooling becomes dominant in the lower densities as discussed in section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] .      in this section",
    ", we assume that the hard x - ray emission detected with _",
    "suzaku _ has non - thermal origin and we concentrate on the particle acceleration processes in am her .",
    "as demonstrated in sections [ section : ana_qui_spec ] and [ section : ana_qui_phaseresolved ] , the x - ray luminosity of the power - law component of am her was @xmath198 at @xmath12 pc in 0.5  10 kev band , which is the same order of magnitude as that of the first wd - pulsar candidate , ae aqr , at @xmath199 at @xmath200 pc @xcite .",
    "thus , neither bremsstrahlung nor curvature radiations are feasible as a physical process of non - thermal emissions from a viewpoint of radiation efficiencies , although another possibility is the synchrotron radiation from about mev electrons under the strong magnetic field of the wd @xcite .    if particles are accelerated by an electric potential induced by the spin rotation of the magnetized wd up to @xmath201 volts , the acceleration process should occur on the same place as the non - thermal emissions ; i.e. , near the wd surface where the magnetic field is strong enough to create hard x - rays via synchrotron process . however , in such a polar - cap case , the emissions should present spin pulsations like ae aqr case , whereas no modulations were observed in the hard x - ray band from am her ( section [ section : ana_lc ] ) . thus , electric acceleration mechanism may be less feasible , although we need more theoretical studies . in this section ,",
    "we further consider another possibility of diffusive shock - acceleration mechanism @xcite on the accretion shock on the pole .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration mechanism occurs on the collisionless - shock case , which will be realized when the kinetic energy of the plasma particles exceeds the coulomb potential of the plasma .",
    "the ratio between them are called as the binding parameter , @xmath202 , and the collisionless shock occurs on the condition of @xmath203 .",
    "the parameter can be described by @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a temperature of the pre - shock matters .",
    "therefore , the accretion shock on the wd pole has a condition of a collisionless shock . in the post - shock plasma , according to equation ( 5.31 ) by @xcite the collisional timescale between the electrons and ions , @xmath206 , is given as @xmath207 which is one order of magnitude smaller than the cooling time scale ( typically @xmath0 0.3 sec ) by equation ( [ eq : flare_cool ] ) .",
    "therefore , the collisionless region exists at the top of the accretion column , just beneath the shock , although electrons themselves or protons themselves may be in the collisional equilibrium under high densities .",
    "this idea is supported by the fact that the shallower spin modulation was observed in the harder energy band ( section [ section : ana_lc ] ) .",
    "we can assume that the magnetic field is parallel to the shock normal .",
    "in this case , the acceleration time - scale on the shock ( @xmath208 ) is derived as @xmath209 where @xmath210 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 are fluctuation of the magnetic field ( @xmath214 ) , the maximum energy of accelerated electrons , electric charge , and the magnetic field strength , respectively @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath215 ( bohm limit ) , @xmath216 , and @xmath151 at equation ( [ eq : u_shock ] ) , the @xmath217 becomes @xmath218 which is very small compared with acceleration time scale in young supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the actual case of the accretion flow onto the wd , the magnetic fluctuation may be @xmath219 , but if it satisfies @xmath220 , the time scale of the acceleration @xmath217 is much shorter than the time scale of the accretion @xmath221",
    "s.    the synchrotron loss time scale ( @xmath222 ) is , on the other hand , @xmath223 from @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated electron is achieved when the acceleration time - scale becomes same to the synchrotron loss time - scale .",
    "the maximum energy of the accelerated electrons is , thus , @xmath224 our result imply that the accretion shock of cvs can accelerate electrons up to @xmath0gev when @xmath215 , which is seen in the cases of young supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae . in cases of @xmath219 , which work out",
    "when the shock is close to the wd surface and the magnetic field dominates the dynamics of the flow , the maximum energy will be reduced as the dependency of @xmath225 ; i.e. , @xmath211 will be @xmath0mev at @xmath226 .",
    "note that the maximum energy of protons can be @xmath0 1800 times larger than electrons , @xmath0 gev to tev .",
    "the cut - off frequency of synchrotron x - rays ( @xmath227 ) is @xmath228 which is higher than our observation band , under an assumption of the bohm limit condition .",
    "we have observed the polar , am her , in a very low state with _ suzaku _ at the x - ray luminosity of @xmath229 erg sec@xmath29 in the 0.5  10 kev band",
    "the object shows a flare phenomenon reaching the x - ray luminosity of @xmath230 erg sec@xmath29 in the 0.5  10 kev band , with a time scale of @xmath0 3700 sec ( section [ section : ana_lc ] ) .",
    "the x - ray spectra can be reproduced by the thermal - plasma mekal model with the temperature of @xmath2 kev and the abundance of @xmath58 solars ( section [ section : ana_flare ] ) . in discussion on the time scale of the flare",
    ", we concluded that it should not be the cooling time scale of the plasma from constraints on the plasma size and density ( section [ section : discussion_param_flare ] ) .",
    "2 .   the x - ray light curves during the quiescence show a clear spin modulation at 0.1289273(2 ) days at bjd 2454771.581 .",
    "these values are consistent with those in a high state ( section [ section : ana_lc ] ) .",
    "the spectra during the quiescence are well represented by mekal + pl model or a single cemekl model ( section [ section : ana_qui_spec ] ) .",
    "the phase - resolved analyses also support these two models ( section [ section : ana_qui_phaseresolved ] ) .",

    "am her in various states , we found that the temperature is positively correlated with the volume emission measure .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "results in a very low state also follow this relation .",
