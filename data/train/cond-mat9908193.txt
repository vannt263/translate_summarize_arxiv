    "recently , the shot noise in mesoscopic contacts became a subject of extensive study ( see recent book @xcite and review @xcite ) .",
    "the 1/3 shot noise suppression in diffusive metal contacts was obtained almost simultaneously in 1992 using the quantum - coherent @xcite and semiclassical @xcite approaches .",
    "since then it was disputed whether both approaches addressed the same effect .",
    "for example , de jong and beenakker @xcite suggested that quantum coherence is not required for the 1/3 suppression , while landauer @xcite argued that semiclassical and quantum - coherent effects are different and 1/3 is just a numerical coincidence .",
    "although very important properties of shot noise like universality @xcite and exchange effect in multiterminal contacts @xcite originally obtained within the quantum - coherent approach were then rederived using the semiclassical approach,@xcite a direct proof of equivalence of these approaches is still absent .",
    "an important step in this direction was very recently made by gramespacher and bttiker , who introduced effective local distribution function for a phase - coherent nonequilibrium conductor and expressed the current fluctuations at local tunnel probes attached to it in terms of this function .",
    "@xcite    a related problem is the frequency dependence of nonequilibrium noise in diffusive contacts .",
    "this dependence is affected by quantum effects and effects of self - consistent electrical field . while the former effects were successfully described in terms of quantum - coherent formula for the shot noise,@xcite the latter presented a certain difficulty for this approach ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of this issue ) .",
    "although particular results were obtained for nonequilibrium charge fluctuations in quantum point contacts and chaotic cavities in terms of discrete capacitances,@xcite they could not be extended to metallic diffusive conductors , for which the potential needs to be treated as a field . on the contrary",
    ", the semiclassical approach provides an easy treatment of long - range electron - electron interaction @xcite yet rules out the description of quantum effects .",
    "this paper is intended to some extent to bridge the gap between the phase - coherent and semiclassical approaches .",
    "we present a method for calculating frequency - dependent shot noise in a phase - coherent diffusive metallic conductor with account taken of self - consistent electrical field .",
    "this method is an extension of keldysh green s function formalism used by altshuler _",
    "@xcite to the case of interacting electrons.@xcite we show that phase - coherent equations may be written in the form very similar to the semiclassical ones , so that both approaches are _ mathematically _ equivalent at sufficiently low frequencies . as an illustration of this method , we calculate quantum noise in nonequilibrium contacts in the presence of a strong external screening .",
    "to calculate the noise , we make use of keldysh diagrammatic technique , which is valid not only at finite temperatures , but also for nonequilibrium systems .",

    "both quantities have a similar structure , i.e. they contain an even number of correlators @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast to this , the quantity @xmath36 @xmath37 contains only one @xmath25 and presents the current response to the external electric potential .",
    "hence the first two terms in ( [ s-3 ] ) have a simple physical meaning : they represent correlations between the current fluctuations caused directly by random motion of noninteracting electrons and the current fluctuations induced by density fluctuations of noninteracting electrons through the mediation of electric field .",
    "as will be shown below , the quantity @xmath38 represents a correlator of electric potentials , and the last term in ( [ s-3 ] ) presents a correlator of currents induced by their fluctuations .",

( [ g^k-1 ] ) , one may obtain a diffusion equation for @xmath46 in the form @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "equation ( [ g^k-1 ] ) suggests that all the diagrams for the expressions ( [ s_0 - 1 ] ) - ( [ q-1 ] ) are constructed of retarded and advanced green s functions including keldysh function vertices @xmath49 and dressed with the random impurity potential correlators @xmath50 . summing up an impurity - potential ladder between oppositely directed retarded and advanced green s functions results in a diffuson @xmath51 which obeys the equation @xcite @xmath52    { \\cal d } ( { { \\bf r}}_1 , { { \\bf r}}_2 , \\omega )    =    -2\\pi n_f    \\delta ( { { \\bf r}}_1 - { { \\bf r}}_2 ) , \\label{d-2}\\ ] ] and summing this ladder between the functions of the same direction results in a cooperon , which obeys a similar equation .",
    "when performing the averaging , we retained only the terms of lowest order in @xmath53 .",
    "this excludes any integrations over the momentum transferred by diffusons or cooperons .",
    "in particular , any cooperon impurity ladders as well as diffuson impurity ladders between different electron loops were omitted .",
    "this also implies that the localization corrections are neglected since they contain a small parameter @xmath53.@xcite hence the diagrams to be selected should consist of ordinary electron loops and diffusons connected in series and carrying the same momentum transfer @xmath17 .",
    "our consideration is also restricted to the diffusion approximation , i.e. frequencies @xmath54 much smaller than the inverse elastic scattering time @xmath55 and characteristic length scales much larger    than @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that in the momentum representation , the diagrams selected be of lowest possible order or most singular in @xmath17 .    the diagrammatic expansion for @xmath56 is obtained by collecting diagrams of lowest order in @xmath17 without interaction lines ( see fig .",
    "empty arrows denote single - electron advanced green s functions , full arrows denote retarded green s functions , full circles denote @xmath57 , and empty circles denote current vertices .",
    "the diagrams @xmath58 - @xmath59 contain no diffusons .",
    "as @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay at a short length @xmath21 , they form the term @xmath60-correlated in space , i.e. the analog of the bare correlator of extraneous currents in the langevin approach .",

    "the rest of diffuson endings are given by similar derivatives , their signs depending on the types of incoming and outgoing green s functions , and result in a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "physically , these derivatives reflect the fact that the current fluctuation is proportional to the density gradient .",
    "this is why diagrams @xmath65 and @xmath61 appear to be of zeroth order in @xmath17 as well as @xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "the advanced green s functions change their type for retarded at the vertices including keldysh functions @xmath46 . wherever a diffuson is interrupted by a pair of such vertices ( diagrams @xmath69  @xmath62 ) , the diffuson frequency changes its sign and a hikami box @xcite denoted by a dashed cross appears",
    "this box is presented by the sum of the three diagrams shown in fig .",
    "3 . though each of them gives a contribution of zeroth order in @xmath17 , they cancel out each other so that the sum vanishes in a homogeneous metal at @xmath70 .",
    "a hikami box with two diffuson vertices at @xmath71 and @xmath72 is given by the convolution of @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75    and the hikami box with a current vertex at @xmath71 and diffuson vertex at @xmath72 is given by a convolution of the same quantities with @xmath76 any diffuson vertex in a hikami box introduces also a factor of @xmath77 .",
    "correspondingly , these two types of boxes introduce factors of @xmath78 and @xmath17 .",
    "qualitatively , their role can be understood as follows : they convert local correlators of extraneous langevin currents @xmath79 at some point into local fluctuations of charge density @xmath80 , whose propagation to points @xmath71 and @xmath72 is described by the diffusons .",
    "as @xmath46 remain finite at @xmath81 , integration of their products with respect to @xmath82 would result in a divergency . to eliminate these divergencies , diagrams @xmath83 - @xmath84",

    "the most singular diagrams for the correlator @xmath92 are shown in fig .",
    "they are very similar to the diagrams for @xmath93 except that the right - hand current endings are missing .",
    "for this reason , local contributions like @xmath67  @xmath68 are also missing , because they give a contribution of the order of @xmath17 ,    whereas the rest of diagrams are of the order of @xmath94 . combining the two first diagrams with the three last ones to eliminate the divergencies in integrals over @xmath82 and making use of the identity ( [ identity ] ) ,",

    "the two terms in ( [ q-1 ] ) give contributions of opposite signs yet with the energies in @xmath46 shifted by @xmath54 .",
    "hence the integration over the energy gives @xmath98 since @xmath97 is proportional to @xmath54 , the contribution from the coulomb interaction vanishes at @xmath99 and the noise in this case is essentially the same as for noninteracting electrons , much like it is in the semiclassical theory.@xcite    the potentials of screened interaction satisfy the equations @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 @xmath103 , \\label{v^k-1}\\ ] ] where the bare interaction potential @xmath104 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath105 the polarization operators @xmath106 @xmath107 describe the screening of bare potential ( [ v_0 ] ) , and the polarization operator @xmath108 @xmath109 actually presents the density  density correlator of noninteracting electrons .",
    "following altshuler and aronov,@xcite one obtains expressions for @xmath110 and @xmath111 in the form @xmath112 for the particular case of an infinite conductor , solving the integral equations ( [ v^r-1 ] ) and ( [ v^a-1 ] ) with the kernels ( [ pi^r-2 ] ) gives the spatial fourier transforms of @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the conductivity of the metal .",
    "making use of equations ( [ v^r-1 ] ) and ( [ v^a-1 ] ) , the expression for @xmath38 may be recast in the form @xmath117 this suggests that @xmath38 actually presents a correlator of fluctuating electric potentials caused by fluctuations of electron density .",
    "the most singular in @xmath17 diagrams for the density  density correlator @xmath118 are shown in fig .",
    "much like the diagrams for @xmath92 , these diagrams do not contain local terms of zeroth order in @xmath17 since the leading contribution is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the first two diagrams are combined with the third one using the identity ( [ identity ] ) , which results in an analytical expression    @xmath119    it should be noted that the terms involving the electron ",
    "electron interaction in ( [ s-3 ] ) appear to be more singular in @xmath17 than @xmath93 .",
    "however they also contain excess powers of frequency @xmath54 , which makes all the terms in ( [ s-3 ] ) comparable in the diffusive limit .    in an equilibrium conductor with electric potential",
    "@xmath40 the green s function @xmath46 is of the form @xcite @xmath120,\\ ] ] where @xmath121 is the fermi distribution function for a given temperature .",
    "hence one may define the local distribution function in nonequilibrium metal via the relationship @xmath122 ,   \\label{f-1}\\ ] ] so that it satisfies the standard diffusion equation and the boundary conditions for the semiclassical distribution function .",
    "this definition of @xmath83 is merely equivalent to the definition of gramespacher and bttiker in terms of distribution functions in electrodes and the injectivities of these electrodes.@xcite in terms of @xmath83 , the effective noise temperature @xmath123 may be written as @xmath124      +      f ( { { \\bf r } } , { \\varepsilon}+ \\omega )      [        1 - f ( { { \\bf r } } , { \\varepsilon } )      ]    \\right\\}. \\label{t_n-2}\\ ] ] in equilibrium , this expression reduces to @xmath125 which presents the standard factor in the nyquist formula .",
    "it is easily verified ( see appendix for details ) that calculating the noise on the basis of eqn .",
    "( [ s-3 ] ) results into the expressions for its spectral density identical to those given by the following quantum extension of the semiclassical boltzmann  langevin scheme . as well as in the semiclassical case ,",
    "the fluctuation of current is formally described by a langevin equation @xcite @xmath126 where the fluctuation of charge density @xmath127 satisfies the equation @xmath128 the self - consistent fluctuation of electric potential obeys the poisson equation @xmath129 and the spectral density of extraneous currents @xmath130 is given by @xmath131 where @xmath123 is expressed in terms of the effective distribution function ( [ f-1 ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the correlator of these currents is quantum , whereas the response to the extraneous currents remains semiclassical .",
    "the reason for this is that in dirty metals , the response functions are presented by diffusons and screened interaction lines connected in series , which describe classical propagation of fluctuations , and the interference corrections to them are small .",
    "it should be stressed that these interference corrections have nothing to do with the quantum noise , which results solely from the shifts in energy of the keldysh functions that appear in pairs in ordinary electron loops and the hikami boxes . for equilibrium systems ,",
    "this noise is a universal feature @xcite and does not depend on the presence of interference phenomena .    at @xmath132 , equation ( [ prb-8 ] )",
    "transforms into semiclassical eqn .",
    "( 8) of ref.@xcite .",
    "hence it is not surprising that the low - frequency properties of quantum - coherent shot noise @xcite may be rederived also in the semiclassical approach.@xcite",
    "now we apply this formalism to calculations of the zero - temperature shot noise in a long contact with strong external screening .",
    "consider a contact of length @xmath133 and circular section with a diameter @xmath134 that connects two massive electrodes with a voltage drop @xmath135 between them .",
    "the third electrode presents a perfectly conducting grounded shielding of the contact , which is coaxial with it and isolated from its surface with a thin insulating film of thickness @xmath136 and dielectric constant @xmath137 ( see fig .",
    "7 , inset ) . in this case",
    ", the distribution function ( [ f-1 ] ) obeys a one - dimensional diffusion equation with the boundary conditions @xmath138 at zero temperature , the solution is of the form @xmath139 hence @xmath140 equations ( [ prb-5 ] )  ( [ prb-10 ] ) were solved in @xcite for the contact geometry in hand . using the response of current at the left edge of the contact @xmath141 to the extraneous current @xmath142 obtained there , the spectral density of current fluctuations at one of the contact ends may be presented in the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the resistance of the contact , @xmath145 is the longitudinal coordinate , and @xmath146          +          \\cos [ 2\\gamma_{\\omega } ( l - x ) ]         } {          \\cosh ( 2\\gamma_{\\omega } l   )          -           \\cos ( 2\\gamma_{\\omega } l   )         } ,    \\label{k}\\ ] ] where @xmath147 . at sufficiently high frequencies ,",
    "the kernel @xmath148 exponentially decreases with @xmath145 .",
    "this decrease has a simple physical explanation . at contact dimensions much larger than the    debye screening length ,",
    "the local current fluctuations inside the contact described by correlator ( [ prb-8 ] ) induce the current fluctuations at the contact edges through the long - range fluctuations of electrical field .",
    "however at finite frequencies , the field - induced fluctuational charges are allowed to pile up at the outer surface of the contact .",
    "hence the electric lines of force emerging from the middle points of the contact are intercepted by the screening electrode and do not reach the contact edges .",
    "hence it is only the portions of the contact adjacent to its edges that contribute to the measurable noise.@xcite the integration gives @xmath149 @xmath150 . \\label{s_i-2}\\ ] ] in particular , @xmath151 at @xmath152 and @xmath153 at @xmath154 .",
    "note that in the latter case , the equilibrium quantum noise grows as @xmath155 . in terms of the nyquist formula",
    "@xmath156 this superlinear increase is due to the fact that the real part of inverse effective impedance @xmath157 of the contact exhibits a square - root increase in this frequency range .",
    "contour plots of @xmath158 vs. normalized voltage and normalized frequency are shown in fig .",
    "7 . from this figure and eqn .",
    "( [ s_i-4 ] ) it is readily seen that quantum noise ( voltage - independent term ) dominates over the shot noise ( term proportional to voltage ) even at @xmath159 provided that @xmath54 is sufficiently large .",
    "the reason is that in this case the noise is caused by extraneous currents near the contact edges , where the distribution function only slightly differs from the equilibrium one.@xcite in the opposite case of a short contact the standard expression ( [ s_i-3 ] ) obtained in ref.@xcite is valid for all frequencies .",
    "recently , measurements of quantum shot noise were performed for mesoscopic diffusive contacts.@xcite hence these results are of direct experimental interest .",
    "in summary , we have shown that in a phase - coherent diffusive metal , the high - frequency nonequilibrium noise may be described by semiclassical hydrodynamic langevin equations with quantum sources . in long contacts with a strong external screening",
    "the crossover between the shot and quantum noise may take place at frequencies much lower than the voltage drop across the contact because the noise is dominated by the extreme contact regions , where the electron distribution is slightly affected by the applied voltage .",
    "the author is grateful to g.  b.  lesovik for a stimulating discussion .",
    "the equivalence between the results of diagrammatic approach and of the proposed quantum extension of boltzmann  langevin method may be demonstrated as follows . by applying the laplace operator to both sides of equations ( [ v^r-1 ] ) and ( [ v^a-1 ] ) and making use of the equation for the diffuson ( [ d-2 ] )",
