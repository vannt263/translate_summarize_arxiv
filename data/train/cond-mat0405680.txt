    "lacoo@xmath2  has unusual physical properties , which have attracted continuing interest for decades.@xcite nevertheless , the magnetic , electronic , and structural properties of this compound remain the subject of controversial discussion .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 shows a maximum around 100k that is usually ascribed to a spin - state transition from a nonmagnetic insulating state at low temperatures to a paramagnetic insulating state at higher temperatures.@xcite in addition , around 500k a metal - insulator transition  occurs,@xcite which is accompanied by an increase of the magnetic moment leading to a broad plateau in the magnetic susceptibility.@xcite the co@xmath3 ions may occur in three different spin states , the low - spin ( ls)(@xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the intermediate - spin ( is)(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , and the high - spin ( hs ) state ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "the energies of these spin states depend on the balance between the crystal field splitting ( @xmath13 ) and the hund s rule coupling ( @xmath14 ) . a multiplet calculation for a @xmath15 configuration in a cubic crystal field yields that the ground state is either the ls ( large @xmath13 ) or the hs state ( large @xmath14 ) , but never the is state.@xcite therefore , in earlier publications the spin - state transition  was often attributed to a thermal population of the hs state from the ls ground state.@xcite however",
    ", a population of the hs state should result in a susceptibility that is much larger than observed experimentally.@xcite more recent investigations  @xcite favor a ls / is scenario , which yields a quantitative description of @xmath16 and which also explains an experimentally observed scaling behavior between @xmath17 and the thermal expansion  @xmath18.@xcite from a theoretical point of view the ls / is scenario is supported by the results of lda+u calculations ( where lda stands for the local density approximation ) , which yield that the is state may be stabilized by a hybridization between co @xmath19  and o @xmath20 levels.@xcite nevertheless , the question of which spin state is populated is not yet clarified unambiguously . based on high - field electron spin resonance ( esr )",
    "data the population of a spin - orbit coupled hs state with a total angular momentum @xmath21 has been suggested recently.@xcite here , @xmath22 denotes the effective orbital momentum arising from the partial occupation of the @xmath23orbital .",
    "however , this esr result is in conflict with the susceptibility  data , because the esr data yield a @xmath24 factor of about 3.5 which leads to a magnetic susceptibility  that is about three times larger than that observed experimentally .    within the originally proposed ls / hs scenario",
    "the reduced absolute value of the susceptibility  has been traced back to an ordering of ls and hs co@xmath3 ions . moreover ,",
    "this ordering was used to explain that despite the partial occupation of @xmath19  states above the spin - state transition  around 100k lacoo@xmath2  remains insulating up to about 500k and the metal - insulator transition  was attributed to a melting of this order .",
    "however , no experimental evidence for such a ls / hs superstructure has been reported so far . within the ls /",
    "is scenario the occurrence of orbital order which remains stable up to 500k has been proposed as a cause why the metal - insulator transition  and the spin - state transition  do not coincide.@xcite experimental evidence for orbital order stems from changes of phonon modes measured by optical spectroscopy@xcite and from a pair density function analysis of pulsed neutron data@xcite .",
    "more recently , a high - resolution single crystal x - ray study of lacoo@xmath2  has revealed a small monoclinic distortion that is related to the jahn - teller ( jt ) effect of the thermally excited co@xmath3 ions in the is state.@xcite indirect evidence for this scenario is also obtained from the scaling between @xmath16 and @xmath18 around the spin - state transition,@xcite which requires that the orbital degeneracy of the is state is lifted as it is the case for jt - distorted coo@xmath25 octahedra .",
    "moreover , a suppression of the jt distortion in the metallic phase should restore the orbital degeneracy and thus could partially explain the enhanced magnetic susceptibility above the metal - insulator transition.@xcite alternative explanations of the enhanced susceptibility  in the metallic phase rely on scenarios which include all three different spin states , assuming that the is state is populated around the spin - state transition  and the hs state becomes populated at the metal - insulator transition.@xcite    in order to get more insight to the spin - state transition  of lacoo@xmath2  and its relation to the metal - insulator transition  we present an experimental study of the structural changes , the magnetic susceptibility , the electrical resistivity , and the thermal expansion of la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  with @xmath26 .",
    "the basic idea is that the partial substitution of la@xmath3 by the smaller eu@xmath3 systematically increases the chemical pressure which should enhance the crystal field splitting and therefore stabilize the low - spin state .",
    "we have chosen the substitution by eu@xmath3 because it has a vanishing total angular momentum @xmath27 of the 4f shell .",
    "using other rare earth ions with finite @xmath27 would strongly hamper the analysis of the co@xmath3 magnetism .",
    "our main findings are as follows : ( i ) with increasing eu content the spin - state transition is drastically shifted towards higher temperatures .",
    "( ii ) we observe a scaling behavior between the magnetic susceptibility  and the thermal expansion , which gives clear evidence that for low temperatures ( @xmath28k ) and low eu content ( @xmath29 ) the spin - state transition  arises from a thermal population of the is state without orbital degeneracy .",
    "the lack of orbital degeneracy can be interpreted as orbital order or as a consequence of jt distortions of the coo@xmath25 octahedra with co@xmath3 in the jt - active is state  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find some indication that there is an orbital degeneracy of the is state for @xmath30 .",
    "( iii ) all samples are good insulators below 400k . the electrical resistivity behaves like @xmath31 , with an activation energy @xmath32 that strongly increases with eu content .",
    "( iv ) the metal - insulator transition  is shifted only moderately to higher temperatures @xmath33  with increasing eu content , much weaker than that of the spin - state transition .",
    "this shows that @xmath33is only weakly influenced by the thermal population of the is state .",
    "( v ) for all eu concentrations the metal - insulator transition  is accompanied by an increase of @xmath6 of about @xmath34emu / mole and the susceptibilityapproaches a common value for @xmath35k indicating a common spin state .",
    "the nature of this high - temperature spin state remains , however , unclear , because it can not be deduced from an analysis of the susceptibility  data alone .",
    "we prepared crystals of la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  with @xmath36 , 0.1 , 0.15 , 0.2 , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , and 1 by the floating zone method in a four - mirror image furnace .",
    "the preparation parameters are essentially the same as those described in ref . for the growth of la@xmath0sr@xmath1coo@xmath2  single crystals .",
    "the lacoo@xmath2 single crystal studied here is the same as used in refs .. the stoichiometry of the crystals has been checked by energy - dispersive x - ray analysis .",

    "we have found that lacoo@xmath2  and",
    "eucoo@xmath2  are single crystals , whereas the samples with @xmath37 are polycrystalline . the electrical resistivity has been measured by a standard four - probe technique on bar - shaped samples of typical dimensions of @xmath38mm@xmath39 .",
    "wires have been attached by conductive silver epoxy to four gold stripes , which have been evaporated on the sample surface .",
    "we have used a dc technique for resistivity values above 1@xmath40 and an ac technique in the sub-@xmath40 range .",
    "the susceptibility measurements have been performed between 4 and 300k in a field of 0.05 t using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer ( _ cryogenic _ , s600x ) and in the temperature range from 200 to 1000k in a field of 1 t with a home - built faraday balance .",
    "high - resolution measurements of the linear thermal expansion were performed using a home - built capacitance dilatometer in the temperature range from 4 to 180k.@xcite",
    "the results of our room temperature powder x - ray diffraction measurements of la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  are summarized in table  [ tab : lattice ] . with increasing eu content , the cell volume per formula unit shrinks almost linearly by about 6% from 56@xmath39 in lacoo@xmath2  to 52.75@xmath39 in eucoo@xmath2 . between @xmath41 and @xmath42 the symmetry changes from rhombohedral @xmath43 to orthorhombic @xmath44 , as it is typical for perovskites when the tolerance factor @xmath45 decreases .",

    "we find a systematic increase of @xmath51 with increasing eu content .",
    "qualitatively , such an increase may be expected from the decreasing tolerance factor .",
    "when @xmath52 decreases , the deviation of the co - o - co bond angle from 180@xmath53 increases and therefore the hopping probability of charge carriers decreases . in accord with refs .",
    "the resistivity of lacoo@xmath2  shows an activated behavior ( @xmath31 ) below 400k with an activation energy @xmath54k ( see also ref . ) . above 400k a steep decrease of the resistivity takes place , which is , according to optical conductivity data  @xcite , attributed to a metal - insulator transition  around 500k .",
    "note that above this transition lacoo@xmath2 remains a rather poor metal with a resistivity of about 1m@xmath40 cm .",
    "the eu - doped samples show similar @xmath55 curves . as shown in the inset of fig.[fig : rho1 ] the slopes of the @xmath56 versus @xmath57 , i.e.  @xmath58 , curves strongly increase with increasing eu content .",
    "the onset of the steep decrease of @xmath55 is shifted to higher temperatures with increasing @xmath5 , signaling that the metal - insulator transitionis shifted to higher temperatures.@xcite however , the shift of the transition temperature @xmath33  is much weaker than that of @xmath58 . as will be shown later ( fig.[fig : chirho1 ] ) @xmath58 increases by about a factor of 3 and @xmath33  only by about 25% from @xmath36 to  1 .",
    "such a different increase of @xmath58 and @xmath33  has also been found in resistivity measurements on @xmath59coo@xmath2 with @xmath60.@xcite    eu@xmath1coo@xmath2 as a function of temperature for different @xmath5 .",
    "the inset shows the same data on a reciprocal temperature scale.[fig : rho1],width=302 ]      in fig.[fig : fitcdef ] we compare the magnetic susceptibility  of lacoo@xmath2  and of eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "in order to extract the curie susceptibility  of the co@xmath3 ions from the raw data we subtract a background contribution consisting of ( 1 ) a curie - weiss contribution @xmath61 due to magnetic impurities and/or oxygen nonstoichiometry , ( 2 ) a temperature - independent contribution @xmath62 due to the diamagnetism of the core electrons and the van vleck susceptibility of the co@xmath3 ions,@xcite and ( 3 ) the van vleck susceptibility @xmath63 of the eu@xmath3 ions weighted by the eu content @xmath5 .",
    "note that it is _ a priori _ not clear that in la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  all eu ions are three - valent .",

    "in contrast , the @xmath18 curves of the samples with @xmath113 are essentially identical and do not show any anomalous behavior up to 180k .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to use the average of these curves as a background @xmath109 representing the normal lattice expansion , which is present irrespective of the spin - state transition . the anomalous thermal expansion for @xmath4 is then obtained by @xmath114.@xcite as shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig : thermex1 ] we find that for all samples with eu contents @xmath115 the scaling relation between thermal expansion  and magnetic susceptibility  [ eq.([scala ] ) ] is well fulfilled . the scaling factors for the different samples lie in the range from 190 to 210 emu k / mole and agree well with the value expected for a population of the is state without orbital degeneracy and deviate strongly from other possible scenarios ( see table[tab : scaling ] ) .",

    "the observation that for all eu concentrations @xmath142 seems to approach a common value for @xmath143k indicates , however , that for temperatures well above the metal - insulator transition  the same spin state ( or combination of spin states ) is approached in la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  for all @xmath5 .    as shown in fig.[fig : chirho1 ] @xmath96 calculated for the ls / is scenario underestimates the susceptibility  for @xmath144@xmath33 .",
    "notably , well above @xmath33  the deviations between the extrapolations of the low - temperature fit curves and the experimental data amount to about @xmath34emu / mole for all @xmath5 ( if @xmath126 is used for @xmath138 ) . in lacoo@xmath2",
    "a well - defined anomaly in the specific heat @xmath72 has been observed around @xmath33,@xcite showing that the metal - insulator transition  represents a real phase transition , in contrast to the spin - state transition , which is a thermal population of the excited is state above the ls state causing only a broad schottky - type anomaly of @xmath72 ( and @xmath100 ) over a large temperature interval .",
    "consequently , the parameters ( or even the model ) for the description of @xmath96 above and below @xmath33  can be very different . in principle , there are various sources for an enhanced susceptibility  in the metallic phase . as mentioned above the charge - carrier mobility above @xmath33  should melt or at least reduce an orbital order of the is .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to use an orbital degeneracy @xmath126 above @xmath33  in eq.([twolevchi ] ) , which causes an increase of @xmath96.@xcite however , this effect is not sufficient to describe the enhanced susceptibility  above @xmath33  as can be clearly seen from the dashed lines calculated with @xmath126 in the lower panels of fig.[fig : chirho1 ] . from the observation that charge - carrier doped la@xmath145coo@xmath2  ( @xmath146=ca , sr , and ba ) has a ferromagnetic , metallic ground state above a certain doping level,@xcite one may also speculate that an additional increase of @xmath96 could arise from a ferromagnetic coupling above @xmath33 .",
    "however , lacoo@xmath2  above @xmath33  is not directly comparable to la@xmath145coo@xmath2 , because the ferromagnetic coupling in la@xmath145coo@xmath2arises from a double exchange between co@xmath3 and co@xmath147 ions , whereas in lacoo@xmath2  formally only co@xmath3 ions are present .",
    "a different source of an enhancement of @xmath96 could arise from a partial occupation of the hs state above @xmath33 .",
    "based on this assumption describing the susceptibility  of lacoo@xmath2  within a ls / is / hs scenario has been attempted.@xcite however , even within this three - state model the susceptibility  of lacoo@xmath2  is only reproduced if the energies of the is and the hs state change with temperature . within this model a nearly temperature - independent @xmath148k and a strong decrease for @xmath149 from about @xmath150 to about 200k occurring around",
    "@xmath33  has been reported for lacoo@xmath2.@xcite here , @xmath151 ( @xmath149 )",
    "denote the energy between the ls and the is ( hs ) states . due to the large value of @xmath149 the hs state is essentially not populated for @xmath122 .",
    "this implies that below @xmath33  the susceptibility  data of lacoo@xmath2  are described within a ls / is model and above @xmath33  within a ls / is / hs model .",
    "therefore , we have also fitted @xmath96 of our la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  samples separately above and below @xmath33  by the susceptibility  of two- and three - state models . however , in particular within the three - state model , there are so many parameters that physically meaningful results can be obtained only if a well justified model about the nature of the metal - insulator transition  and/or the expected changes of the energies of the various spin states are used .    in order to keep the number of parameters small we decided to restrict ourselves to two - state models and will present a description of @xmath96 within a ls / is scenario with temperature - dependent energy gap as follows .",
    "an additional reason why we do not use the three - state model is that the splitting between different spin states is typically of the order of @xmath152k.@xcite the small splitting between the ls and is states ( @xmath153 - 2000k ) observed in la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2already requires a fine tuning of parameters .",
    "thus it appears quite natural to assume that the hs state is located well above the other two spin states . once we have fixed the model in this way",
    ", it is straightforward to derive the temperature dependence @xmath154 by writing eq.[twolevchi ] in the form @xmath155   \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : gap}\\ ] ]    initially we tried to use the @xmath24 factors of table  [ tab : gap ] obtained from the susceptibility  fits well below @xmath33  with temperature independent energy gaps in order to derive the energy dependence @xmath154 for larger temperatures .",
    "however , for @xmath156 the argument of the logarithm in eq.([eq : gap ] ) becomes negative above about 500k .",
    "therefore we have used @xmath157 for all samples and obtained the temperature - dependent energy gaps shown in fig.[fig : gap].@xcite for @xmath134 we have used @xmath125 and find a moderate temperature dependence of @xmath158 in the low - temperature range .",
    "the average values @xmath159 for @xmath160k are close to the values obtained from the fits with temperature - independent @xmath128 [ see table  [ tab : gap ] ] .",
    "this further justifies the fits of @xmath96 within the ls / is scenario in the low - temperature range .",
    "for @xmath138 we use @xmath126 ( as in the fits of @xmath96 ) and find some tendency to saturation only for @xmath137 , but not for eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "thus , for @xmath138 we can give only lower boundaries of @xmath154 , which are so large that the obtained low - temperature values of @xmath96 are smaller than our experimental uncertainty .",
    "so far the @xmath154 curves for @xmath138 do not contradict the ls / is scenario for the low - temperature range .     between the ls and",
    "the is states obtained from eq.[eq : gap ] using @xmath125 for @xmath134 and @xmath126 for @xmath138 and @xmath157 for all @xmath5 .",
    "( see text ) [ fig : gap],width=302 ]    at higher temperatures the @xmath158 curves strongly decrease for all samples .",
    "this decrease sets in when the metal - insulator transition  is approached and is present up to 1000k .",
    "a possible interpretation of the strong decrease of @xmath128 around @xmath33  is that due to the metal - insulator transition  the is state is lowered in energy and is finally located well below the ls state . within this interpretation the continuous decrease of @xmath154 up to the highest temperatures",
    "is not expected .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that the application of eqs.([twolevchi ] ) and  ( [ eq : gap ] ) is questionable in the conducting state above @xmath33 , because these equations are based on a model with localized moments .",
    "note that this problem is also present for the three - state models .",
    "one may suspect that a temperature - dependent energy gap could resolve the problem that on the one hand esr data of lacoo@xmath2  propose a thermal population of a spin - orbit coupled hs state with @xmath161 and @xmath162,@xcite while on the other hand the susceptibility  data are not at all reproduced by a population of such a state with a temperature - independent gap .",
    "therefore we also calculated @xmath154 using these values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) .",
    "for lacoo@xmath2  this leads to a continuously increasing energy gap from @xmath163k to @xmath164k interrupted by a plateau of @xmath128 from @xmath165k , i.e.  the temperature dependence of @xmath128 roughly resembles that of @xmath166 . with increasing",
    "eu content @xmath167 remains essentially unchanged , because @xmath168 is almost constant , but the temperature dependence of @xmath169 continuously decreases until @xmath158 is roughly constant for @xmath137 and finally decreases with increasing temperature for @xmath170 . because there is no reason why the temperature dependence of @xmath128 should change so drastically as a function of eu content",
    ", we do not consider this complex @xmath171 scenario as physically meaningful .    in conclusion",
    ", the analysis of the susceptibility  data of la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2  reveals that a good description is possible within a ls / is scenario below the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we find a drastic increase of the energy of the is state with increasing eu content and that for all eu concentrations the metal - insulator transition  is accompanied by an increase of the susceptibility  of about @xmath172emu / mole .",
    "this increase either indicates a strong decrease of the energy of the is state around @xmath33 , or that a model of localized spins is no longer applicable above @xmath33 .",
    "it remains to be clarified whether @xmath96 above @xmath33  has to be described by local moments or not .",
    "we have studied the influence of chemical pressure on the spin - state transition and on the metal - insulator transition  of lacoo@xmath2  by partially substituting the la@xmath3 by the smaller eu@xmath3 ions . on the one hand",
    "the eu substitution drastically influences the activation energy for charge transport in the insulating phase , which increases from about 1200k in lacoo@xmath2  to about 3200k in eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "the transition temperature of the metal - insulator transition , on the other hand , shows only a moderate change from about 480k in lacoo@xmath2  to about 600k in eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "contrary to the metal - insulator transition , the spin - state transition  is shifted very strongly towards higher temperatures with increasing eu content as is observed independently in thermal expansion  as well as in magnetic susceptibility  measurements of la@xmath0eu@xmath1coo@xmath2 .",
    "both quantities fulfill a simple scaling relation for @xmath29 and @xmath173k .",
    "the experimentally obtained scaling factors agree very well with the value expected for a thermal population of the is state without orbital degeneracy . within this ls /",
    "is scenario the experimental susceptibility  data below about 450k are satisfactorily reproduced for @xmath134 , whereas for larger @xmath5 an orbital degeneracy of @xmath126 yields a better description .",
    "the lack of orbital degeneracy for @xmath134 is an indirect evidence of orbital order , or a jt effect , between the thermally excited co@xmath3 ions in the is state . for @xmath174",
    "this effect seems to play a minor role .",
    "this may arise from two effects which both act against an orbital / jt ordering : the spin - state transition  occurs ( i ) at higher absolute temperatures and ( ii ) closer to the metal - insulator transition . with increasing eu content we find a drastic increase of the energy splitting between the ls and the is state from about 190k in lacoo@xmath2  to about 2200k in eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "as a consequence the population of the is close to @xmath33  is very different for both compounds : @xmath175% in lacoo@xmath2  and @xmath176% in eucoo@xmath2 .",
    "this difference clearly shows that the occurrence of the metal - insulator transition  is not related to the population of the is state .",
    "so far the metal - insulator transition  and the spin - state transition  are decoupled from each other .",
    "the fact that for all eu concentrations the susceptibility  increases by about @xmath172emu / mole around the metal - insulator transition  and approaches a doping - independent value for @xmath35k indicates that nevertheless a common spin state , or combination of spin states , is approached well above @xmath33 .",
    "the nature of this spin state remains , however , unclear at present .",
