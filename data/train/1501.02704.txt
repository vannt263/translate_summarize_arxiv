    "due to thermally activated electronic transitions , these @xmath2 passive acoustical modes become separated from the top of the electron - hole continuum and at temperatures of the order of the fermi energy they behave completely similar to out - of - phase plasmon modes in multilayer structures with equal finite carrier densities in each layer .",
    "intrinsic thermal plasmon modes are formed also in single - layer neutral graphene structures  @xcite .",
    "importantly , in the long wavelength limit these temperature induced in - phase and out - of - phase intrinsic plasmon modes in multilayer graphene structures preserve their characteristic square - root and linear energy dispersions , are landau damped , and disappear at vanishing temperatures .",
    "the situation is qualitatively different in graphene nanoribbons , specifically in armchair metallic nanoribbons with a single - particle dirac spectrum of massless chiral fermions  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "when the chemical potential is at the charge neutrality point there exist intrinsic plasmons at zero temperature and these plasmons are not landau damped .",
    "in this article we study the effect of finite temperature and doping on the plasmon modes in individual and coulomb - coupled metallic armchair graphene nanoribbons , schematically shown in fig .",
    "first we calculate the lindhard polarization function using the standard approach based on the random phase approximation  @xcite . the previous works on this system neglect either the intra - band contribution to the finite temperature polarization function  @xcite or the inter - band contribution to the zero temperature polarization function  @xcite .",
    "here , we fully take into account both the inter - band and intra - band parts of the polarization function for arbitrary temperature and position of the chemical potential , within the lowest subband of transverse quatization .",
