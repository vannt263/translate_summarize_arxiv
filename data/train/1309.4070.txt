    "this yields a holonomy with values in the hopf algebra of chord diagrams in the circle @xmath101 , which is , modulo an easily resolvable anomaly , a link invariant , normally called the kontsevich integral , being a universal vassiliev invariant of links ; see @xcite .",
    "categorifications of link invariants have been quite popular since khovanov s celebrated construction of a categorification of the jones polynomial in @xcite , which has been generalized in a plethora of ways ( see for example @xcite ) , and proven to be inherently 4-dimensional @xcite .",
    "this also sparked research on the very categorification of the quantum groups themselves @xcite .",
    "most approaches to the categorification of quantum groups invariants of links use combinatorial frameworks ( one notable exception is @xcite ) . given the discussion in the previous paragraphs , it seems natural to use tools from differential geometry ( and here we mean the notion of holonomy , and its higher order versions ) as a framework for categorifying quantum knot invariants , and presumably extend them to invariants of braid and of link cobordisms .",
    "this paper is a continuation of previous work in this direction @xcite , however still on the very heavy algebraic and categorical side of it .",
    "as indicated by the previous paragraph , in order to use holonomy techniques to define invariants of link and braid cobordisms , we would need a two dimensional notion of holonomy , which make sense for embedded surfaces in a manifold .",
    "this can be achieved by considering 2-connections in 2-bundles @xcite , which should have a structure 2-group ( a categorical analogue of a group @xcite ) , rather than simply a principal group of structure .",
    "recall that a strict lie 2-group can be represented by a lie crossed module @xmath102 , where @xmath65 and @xmath103 are lie groups , and @xmath104 is a left action of @xmath65 on @xmath103 by automorphisms , satisfying natural properties ( the peiffer relations ) .",
    "the differential analogue of a strict lie 2-group is a strict lie 2-algebra @xcite .",
    "the latter is uniquely represented by a differential crossed module @xmath105 , where @xmath106 and @xmath29 are lie - algebras , @xmath104 is a left action of @xmath29 on @xmath106 by derivations and @xmath107 is a lie algebra map intertwining the @xmath49-action , such that the peiffer relation @xmath108,$ ] for each @xmath109 , is satisfied .",
    "we note that any semisimple lie algebra @xmath29 gives rise to a family of differential crossed modules ( all having the same weak homotopy type ) , each geometrically realizing the lie algebra 3-cocycle @xmath110\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath111 is the cartan - killing form . in the case of @xmath112 ,",
    "each of these differential crossed modules is called a string lie-2-algebra . for explicit constructions",
    "see @xcite . an explanation of these terms can be found in [ sectionstring ] .",
    "let @xmath105 be a differential crossed module , associated to a lie-2-group .",
    "a @xmath113-valued 2-connection in a manifold @xmath114 is locally given by a pair @xmath115 of forms , where @xmath80 is a 1-form with values in @xmath29 and @xmath7 is a 2-form with values in @xmath106 .",
    "a 2-connection @xmath115 is said to be fake flat if @xmath116 agrees with @xmath117 $ ] , the curvature of @xmath80 .",
    "a local fake flat 2-connection can be integrated to give a 2-dimensional ( surface ) holonomy , for smooth maps @xmath118 ^ 2 \\to m$ ] , with values in the associated lie 2-group ; see @xcite .",
    "this surface holonomy is covariant with respect to a gauge 2-group of transformations , and therefore it also makes sense globally for a 2-bundle with a non - local ( global ) 2-connection ; @xcite . moreover , if a fake flat 2-connection @xmath115 is flat , meaning that the 2-curvature 3-form @xmath119 of @xmath115 vanishes , then this 2-dimensional holonomy is invariant under homotopy , relative to the boundary of the square @xmath120 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "in @xcite we addressed the categorification of the 4-term relations in the language of differential crossed module - valued 2-connections , which led to the definition of an infinitesimal 2-yang - baxter operator in a ( strict ) lie 2-algebra , satisfying conditions categorifying the 4-term relation . in this paper",
    "we address the categorification of an infinitesimal braiding itself ( leading to the definition of a strict infinitesimal 2-braiding , in a linear strict symmetric monoidal 2-category @xmath121 ) and its applications for defining flat ( and moreover fake flat ) 2-connections in the configuration space of @xmath0 particles in the complex plane .",
    "we also introduce the definition of a symmetric quasi - invariant tensor @xmath122 in a differential crossed module @xmath123 , which categorifies the notion of an invariant tensor in a lie algebra . here",
    "@xmath55 is a symmetric tensor , @xmath124 is in the @xmath29-invariant part of @xmath106 and @xmath125 is a linear map , measuring the failure of @xmath60 to be invariant .",
    "each symmetric quasi invariant tensor in @xmath113 leads to the construction of an infinitesimal 2-braiding in a certain linear monoidal 2-category @xmath121 , naturally associated to the differential crossed module @xmath113 .",
    "( we will give explicit details on the construction of @xmath121 , which is not at all trivial . )    finally , we prove that the string lie-2-algebra ( in the version of wagemann @xcite ) contains a non - trivial symmetric quasi - invariant tensor",
    ". this will give another proof of the main result of @xcite , where we proved that this particular string lie-2-algebra contains infinitesimal 2-yang baxter operators , providing a conceptual approach to a proof of the fact that the categorified kz - connection in @xcite is indeed flat .    before describing the plan of the paper ,",
    "we illustrate in more detail some possible applications and related open questions that naturally arise from our construction .",
    "we will address these in future publications .",
    "our interest in symmetric quasi - invariant tensors in lie 2-algebras also stems from the crucial role we expect them to play in understanding lie 2-bialgebras as being the classical limit of quantum 2-groups .",
    "the analogous statement in the  decategorified  setting involves quasitriangular quasi - hopf algebras , drinfeld twists and quasi - lie bialgebras .",
    "we just recall here the main ideas , referring for more details to the original papers by drinfeld @xcite or to @xcite .",
    "a quasitriangular hopf algebra ( qha ) is a hopf algebra @xmath126 whose coproduct @xmath127 is cocommutative up to conjugation by an invertible element @xmath128 , known as the quasitriangular structure ( or @xmath129-matrix ) .",
    "quasitriangular hopf algebras are exactly those whose module category is strict and braided , with triangular hopf algebras ( @xmath130 ) corresponding to symmetric categories . in a quasi - triangular quasi - hopf algebra ( qqha )",
    "the coproduct @xmath127 is coassociative up to conjugation by an invertible element @xmath131 , known as the drinfeld associator ( other structures are relaxed as well but they are not relevant for our present discussion ) , so that its module category is still braided but not strict , in an essential way .",
    "the larger class of qqhas is sometimes more convenient to work with , thanks to a flexible notion of equivalence ( or ` gauge transformations ' ) of qqhas realized by drinfeld twists .",
    "namely , given a qqha @xmath126 and an invertible element @xmath132 , we can define a new qqha @xmath133 by ` twisting ' ( suitably conjugating ) the structures of @xmath126 with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "the two qqhas @xmath126 and @xmath133 will not be isomorphic , in general , nevertheless they have braided monoidally equivalent module categories .    among qqhas ,",
    "a notable class is formed by deformations of universal enveloping algebras ( ueas ) . by deformation",
    "we mean that all the algebraic structures are defined by formal power series in a deformation parameter @xmath95 , and disregarding terms in @xmath95 or higher powers ( resp .",
    "@xmath135 or higher ) should correspond to the undeformed structures ( resp . taking the classical limit ) @xcite .",
    "a quantum universal enveloping algebra ( quea ) is then a qqha @xmath136 such that @xmath137 , the universal enveloping algebra of some lie algebra @xmath49 ( hence @xmath138 and @xmath139 , both equalities mod @xmath95 ) .",
    "drinfeld introduced in @xcite quasi - lie bialgebras as the classical limit of a queas .",
    "a quasi - lie bialgebra @xmath140 is a lie algebra @xmath49 with a compatible lie cobracket @xmath141 ( @xmath141 is a chevalley - eilenberg ( ce ) 1-cocycle on @xmath49 , @xmath142 , with values in @xmath143 ) which satisfies a co - jacobi identity up to a ce - coboundary @xmath144 , with @xmath145 .",
    "important special cases are lie bialgebras , corresponding to @xmath146 , and coboundary lie bialgebras , where @xmath147 for some @xmath148 . in order for @xmath149 to be a well - defined lie cobracket",
    ", the symmetric tensor @xmath150 and @xmath151+[\\rho_{12},\\rho_{23}]+[\\rho_{13},\\rho_{23}]$ ] , the classical yang - baxter equation on @xmath152 , must both be @xmath49-invariant .",
    "the stronger condition @xmath153 corresponds to quasitriangular lie bialgebras ( and further adding @xmath154 we get triangular ones ) .",
    "now , the classical limit of a quea @xmath136 with @xmath137 determines a quasi - lie bialgebra structure on @xmath49 with @xmath155 ( mod @xmath135 ) and @xmath156 ( mod @xmath135 ) .",
    "a crucial result proved by drinfeld is that the element @xmath157 ( mod @xmath135 ) is a symmetric invariant tensor in @xmath49 , stable under drinfeld twists .",
    "moreover , by suitably twisting the quea , we can make @xmath158 ( mod @xmath95 ) and @xmath159 ( mod @xmath135 ) , so that the classical limit of the quea is the quasi - lie bialgebra with @xmath160 ( since @xmath161 ) and @xmath162= - \\ , cyb(r)$ ] .",
    "( note that for @xmath49 semisimple @xmath163 is the generator of @xmath164 , associated to the cartan - killing form , which correspond to the string lie algebra of @xmath49 , see section [ sectionstring ] . )",
    "we denote this quasi - lie bialgebra as @xmath165 , emphasizing that the symmetric invariant tensor @xmath60 contains all the information of the classical limit of the quea .",
    "furthermore , drinfeld proves that , for @xmath49 semisimple , the symmetric @xmath29-invariant tensor @xmath60 permits us to reconstruct the quea , up to twist equivalence , and derives an associator precisely by considering the holonomy of the kz - connection associated to @xmath60 .",
    "a classical limit of drinfeld twists acts on lie quasi - bialgebras , and we can twist back @xmath165 to the more familiar form of a quasitriangular lie bialgebra with @xmath166 , where @xmath167 and @xmath168 , a solution of the modified cyb equation @xmath169 .",
    "we thus see that , given given an @xmath60-matrix @xmath170 , the @xmath29-invariant symmetric part @xmath171 describes the ( infinitesimal ) braiding associated to the lie bialgebra , while the antisymmetric part @xmath172 generates the lie cobracket structure ( and note that , while @xmath60 is stable under twists , @xmath172 can always be twisted away ) .",
    "we conjecture that symmetric quasi - invariant tensors in differential crossed modules , in addition to describing infinitesimal 2-braidings , can be interpreted in the above setting .",
    "namely , it should be possible to canonically associate a quasi - lie 2-bialgebra @xcite to the datum of a lie 2-algebra endowed with a symmetric quasi - invariant tensor .",
    "we also foresee the existence of drinfeld twists for quasi - lie 2-bialgebras , so that the quasi - lie 2-bialgebra associated to a symmetric quasi - invariant tensor can be shown to be twist equivalent to a strict coboundary lie 2-bialgebra whose 2-@xmath60-matrix ( satisfying a categorification of the classical yang - baxter equation ) contains the original symmetric quasi - invariant tensor as its symmetric part .",
    "finally , and most importantly , given a symmetric quasi - invariant tensor @xmath122 , in a differential crossed module @xmath113 , there should exist a quasi - hopf-2-algebra having @xmath173 as the classical limit .",
    "this ` quantization ' process will most likely require the categorification of the concept of drinfeld associators .",
    "examples of drinfeld 2-associators should be constructible from the two - dimensional holonomy of the associated categorified kz - connection .",
    "our axioms of an infinitesimally braided monoidal 2-category are obtained by directly categorifying cartier s notion of an infinitesimally braided category @xcite , through embedding it into the 2-category of 2-vector spaces @xcite , and switching categorical natural transformations into 2-categorical pseudo - natural transformations .",
    "presumably , we could also have followed an alternative approach by directly linearizing the axioms of a braided monoidal 2-category .",
    "( and in fact , we implicitly used this point of view to derive the axiom of coherence for infinitesimal 2-braidings , definition [ coherent ] , which parallels one analogous axiom appearing in ( * ? ? ? * definition 6 ) : the axiom @xmath174 , imposing the equality of two hexagons . )    a natural question to ask is then how it can be precisely stated that an infinitesimal 2-braiding is the infinitesimal counterpart ( or classical limit ) of a given braided monoidal 2-category ( see also remark [ sd ] ) .",
    "a related issue is whether we can always find a braided monoidal 2-category whose classical limit is a given infinitesimal 2-braiding .",
    "again , this will probably require a categorification of the theory of drinfeld associators , and for that we expect that the two dimensional holonomy of the associated categorified knizhnik - zamolodchikov connection may play a major role .",
    "braided surfaces will , in this discussion , mean cobordisms @xmath175 between braids in @xmath176 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] ; @xcite . braided surfaces form a braided monoidal 2-category @xmath177 @xcite , which follows from the general construction of 2-tangles in @xcite .",
    "the objects of @xmath177 are non - negative integers @xmath0 , the monoidal structure being given by the sum .",
    "the set of 1-morphisms @xmath178 is only non - empty when @xmath179 . in the latter case ,",
    "it is made out of braids @xmath180 , with @xmath0 strands , connecting the set @xmath181 to the set @xmath182 .",
    "braids are not considered up to isotopy , but only up to reparametrization , so that they are simply 1-dimensional neat submanifolds of @xmath183 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] , with boundary being @xmath184 .",
    "braids compose vertically ( along @xmath185 } \\times \\{0 , 1\\}$ ] ) and horizontally in the obvious way , and this yields , respectively , the composition and the tensor product of 1-morphisms .",
    "the set of 2-morphisms @xmath186 , where @xmath187 , is given by braided surfaces ( cobordisms ) connecting @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "therefore @xmath190 is a neat submanifold of @xmath191 } \\times [ 0,1]^2 $ ] , with boundary being @xmath192\\big)$ ] .",
    "moreover , the projection @xmath193 ^ 2\\cong [ 0,1]^2 $ ] is to be a branched cover , with simple points only . these ( braided surfaces ) are considered up to the obvious notion of isotopy , relative to the boundary .",
    "braided surfaces compose in three different ways , giving the vertical and horizontal compositions , as well as the tensor product of 2-morphisms ; details are in @xcite .",
    "the monoidal 2-category @xmath177 can be combinatorially presented , a consequence of the general combinatorial description of knotted surfaces in @xcite .",
    "leaving details aside , it is generated by the 1-morphisms of figure [ 1mor ] , and by the 2-morphisms of figure [ 2mor ] ( to which mirror images must be added ) .",
    "these satisfy numerous relations ( movie moves ) , compiled in full generality in @xcite , and in the case of braided surfaces in @xcite . in particular 14 relations are satisfied by these 1- and 2-morphisms , enabling a fully combinatorial description of the monoidal 2-category @xmath177 . of these relations",
    ", it plays a primary role the celebrated zamolodchikov tetrahedron equation , involving only reidemeister iii moves .",
    "only four of the 14 relations between 2-morphisms actually engage the last generating 2-morphism appearing in figure [ 2mor ] ( creation of a branch point ) .",
    "this morphism is of a very different type of the others .",
    "the first two ( reidemeister ii and iii moves ) are generated by isotopies of @xmath194 , and the inherent surface is topologically the disjoint union of two disks . in the latter , we have a branch point of the projection @xmath195 ^ 2 $ ] , and the surface is topologically the union of two disks , with a 1-handle connecting them ( something like a fattened `` h '' ) .    in @xcite , we discussed the issue of assigning a two dimensional holonomy to a surface embedded in a manifold @xmath114 , the latter being provided with a 2-connection .",
    "such a holonomy depends on the isotopy class of the choice of embedding , however this ambiguity is ruled by the mapping class group of the surface itself , only .",
    "( for example , in the case of an embedded 2-sphere , the mapping class group being @xmath196 means that a two - dimensional holonomy can be unambiguously assigned to oriented embedded spheres in @xmath114 . )    to use the categorified kz - connection to define invariants of braid cobordisms we must address the following issues .",
    "first of all , even though braided surfaces are _ bona fide _ 2-dimensional manifolds",
    "( with corners ) , they do not define embeddings @xmath120 ^ 2 \\to \\c(n)/s_n$ ] , where @xmath73 is the configuration space of @xmath0 particles .",
    "rather , we have a smooth map @xmath197 ^ 2 \\setminus \\beta(s ) \\to \\c(n)/s_n$ ] , where @xmath198 is the set of branch points of the projection @xmath195 ^ 2 $ ] ; see figure [ branch ] . at the branch points ,",
    "the map @xmath199 has a very special kind of singularities ; see @xcite .",
    "in order to define the two dimensional holonomy of such a singular map @xmath197 ^ 2 \\setminus\\beta(s)\\to { \\c(n)/s_n}$ ] , one must find a way to deal with these singularities , as far as their two dimensional holonomy is concerned .",
    "this issue is similar to the fact that , for defining invariants of links from the holonomy of the kz - connection , one must first deal with the issue that links @xmath200 do not define maps",
    "@xmath120 \\to \\c(n)/s_n$ ] . rather ,",
    "if @xmath201 is a link , we have a map @xmath202 \\setminus c(l ) \\to \\c(n)$ ] , where @xmath203 is the set of critical values of the projection of @xmath201 into the last variable , which we can suppose to be a morse function , with co - domain @xmath120 $ ] .    in order to define this regularized two - dimensional holonomy",
    ", we probably will need to address categorified chord diagrams , assigned to general two dimensional manifolds , rather than merely disjoint union of disks .",
    "( it is unlikely that the two - dimensional holonomy of the last braided surface of figure [ branch ] ( creation of a branch point ) could be defined without extending the already defined categorified algebras of diagrams ; see @xcite . )",
    "nevertheless , the two - dimensional holonomy approach outlined here and in @xcite can be used to construct algebraic information which can be assigned to the reidemeister ii and iii moves braided surfaces in figure [ 2mor ] .",
