    "nonempirical density functionals of semilocal or generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) type have met with a good degree of success when applied to either isolated molecules@xcite or dense solid - state systems.@xcite generally such approximations do not include the long range dispersion or van der waals ( vdw ) interaction , and hence fail or at best give sporadic results for sparse matter or for the wide range of molecular complexes where the dispersion interaction is an important component of the binding .",
    "even semiempirical gradient functionals typically fail for such systems , in the sense that their parameters must be varied from system to system , and thus lose most of their predictive power .",
    "over the course of the last several years the chalmers - rutgers collaboration@xcite has developed a nonemperical density functional for the correlation energy which showed considerable promise in alleviating the above undesirable situation .",
    "this correlation energy functional is _ not _ of the gga type , but involves a fully non - local integration over pairs of densities at distant points .",
    "nevertheless it is very quick to evaluate and does not significantly lengthen a simple gga density functional calculation for a sufficiently large system . as proposed@xcite , this nonempirical correlation functional has no corresponding nonempirical exchange functional . because the zhang - yang@xcite gga `` revpbe '' exchange functional had been fitted to exact exchange calculations and because we indeed found that it gave the best representation of exchange for this type of problem of all the gga exchange functionals tried , we adopted it as part of our recommended procedure.@xcite this total van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) has been applied to layered structures where it produced reasonable agreement with experimental results .",
    "such layered systems , namely bulk graphite , molybdenum sulfide , boron nitride@xcite as well as the corresponding layered dimers@xcite are all ones in which gga fails completely .",
    "going to a more general geometry,@xcite tests were made on rare - gas dimers as well as the benzene dimer in the particularly simple `` sandwich '' or `` atop - parallel '' geometry .",
    "the benzene dimer represents an ideal testing ground for new correlation density functionals because of the wealth of wave - function calculations@xcite on this system in different geometries .",
    "these represent both mller - plesset theory ( mp2 ) and coupled - cluster theory ( ccsd(t ) ) ; the more recent of the latter represent the current state - of - the - art and are extremely demanding computationally .",
    "their expected accuracy has been well discussed by their practitioners .",
    "these theories based on wavefunction calculations may be adopted as giving reference values , in lieu of conclusions from experimental work on such weakly binding systems , which require a number of assumptions to deduce binding structures and energies.@xcite more recently there have been a rather full set of mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations@xcite on the benzene - phenol , -toluene , -fluorobenzene , and -benzonitrile complexes .",
    "this has provided an opportunity for further testing of the functional on a wider variety of well referenced systems .",
    "such a study has recently been made@xcite which shows promise for the functional for different geometries of those four systems as well .    in this paper",
    ", we make a thorough study of the behavior of this van der waals density functional@xcite ( vdw - df ) for a number of different benzene geometries .",
    "we calculate the interaction energy and lowest energy structure for different geometries of the benzene dimer with a converged calculation using the nonlocal correlation energy functional within the framework of a norm - conserving pseudopotential plane wave code .",
    "the comparison of this straightforward and relatively quick density functional based method with other methods can determine potential errors in this method and how such a method might be utilized in larger , more complicated biological , organic , and/or aromatic systems .",
    "we address the exchange functional by studying the effect of replacing the gga exchange functional with a full hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation .",
    "indeed , we find that slightly weaker repulsion of the full hf calculation gives improved bonding distances along with stronger binding .",
    "the various tradoffs between the two methods are studied and discussed .",
    "we benchmark this functional on the benzene dimer system where a good amount of data is available from other calculations and where generated conclusions still conflict with one another . by comparing with these systems",
    "in which state - of - the - art results exist , we demonstrate that we can utilize this functional for much larger biological and organic systems which go beyond wavefunction calculations .",
    "our calculations were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) with nonlocal correlation energy .",
    "our dft calculations follow the previous prescription ( which we continue to abbreviate as vdw - df ) for calculating binding energies in van der waals bonded systems with this particular nonlocal correlation functional@xcite @xmath0 = t_\\mathrm{s}[\\rho ] + v_\\mathrm{pp}[\\rho]+j[\\rho ] + e_\\mathrm{x}[\\rho ] +   e_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{l}[\\rho ] + e_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{nl}[\\rho ] \\label{vdwdf}\\ ] ] where e is the total energy functional of the dimer or monomer , @xmath1 is the single - particle kinetic - energy functional , @xmath2 is the ionic pseudopotential functional , @xmath3 is the coulombic interaction functional , @xmath4 is the revpbe flavor@xcite of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) exchange functional , @xmath5 is the local contribution to the total correlation energy , and @xmath6 is the nonlocal contribution to the total correlation energy , @xmath7 the kernel can be written in a form allowing rapid evaluation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a function only of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . the details are given in ref .  , which introduces a sum and difference variable decomposition that provides still further simplification .",
    "although similar in spirit to the calculations describing the nonlocal correlation functional in a previous work@xcite , we utilize some notable exceptions .",
    "first , we use norm - conserving pseudopotentials of the troullier - martins type@xcite for @xmath2 within the framework of the _ abinit _",
    "code.@xcite second , we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation potential@xcite as well as charge densities derived from that calculation , _",
    "@xmath14 is @xmath15 for the calculation of each functional .",
    "we calculated a number of representative binding energies using other dft charge densities , but found negligible changes in all results .",
    "we calculate @xmath16 $ ] using revpbe , then subtract the gga correlation energy before adding @xmath5 with a local density approximation ( lda ) correlation functional . whereas each term is calculated using _ abinit _ , we calculate the nonlocal correlation energy @xmath6 as a post process calculation to obtain our vdw - df solution .    except for the evaluation of @xmath6",
    ", we employ a planewave approach with periodic boundary conditions applied to a supercell with large enough spacings such that no spurious interactions exist between periodic replica .",
    "all dimers are placed in a box with 15 to 20    of vacuum between the clusters .",
    "this amount of vacuum proved sufficient for the total charge density to approach zero ( @xmath17 ) well before the the supercell edge .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff used is at least 50  ry corresponding to about @xmath18 plane waves in a cell of 21    per side .",
    "we found that larger supercells and higher energy cutoffs had negligible effect ( less than @xmath19 ) on the total binding energy of any structure .",
    "the post process calculation of @xmath20 was evaluated on a real space grid at a size equal to the supercell and with grid spacings equal to the fourier transform spacings in the planewave calculations .",
    "@xmath20 was evaluated at each grid point and numerically integrated in a manner described in greater detail in a previous work.@xcite although @xmath20 is not calculated self - consistently at this time , other dft charge densities yield no change in the results , suggesting self - consistency would not change any result appreciably or overall conclusions .",
    "we calculated the binding energies of two distinct forms of the benzene dimer , the parallel and t - shape dimers ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for parallel geometries , we considered the on - top parallel sandwich structure ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , and two different slip parallel structures ( fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "we calculated the total binding energies for the slip parallel structures by starting from the graphite - like ab stacked ( minimum energy ) geometry and moving one monomer vertically until a local minimum was reached .",
    "we subsequently moved that monomer horizontally along a c - h bond once that vertical minimum point had been ascertained .",
    "we then moved that same monomer in each direction to verify that this was a local minimum .",
    "once we found this minimum ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , we started from a new slip parallel structure defined by slipping towards the c - c bond .",
    "we moved vertically and horizontally until a new slip parallel minimum was found ( fig .",
    "1(d ) ) .   by slipping in two orthogonal directions ,",
    "we hope to find the lowest possible slip parallel structure .",
    "every benzene molecule was locked at a fixed structure of 1.397    c - c length and 1.079    c - h length .",
    "changing these structures , for example , to the minimum lda or gga geometries made no difference ( @xmath21  kcal / mol ) to any final binding energy results .",
    "fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 show the dft , nonlocal correlation ( vdw - df ) results of three structures including the parallel on top ( sandwich ) structure and two other potential lowest energy structures , the t - shape and the slip parallel structures .",
    "each of these results is compared with recent ccsd(t ) and mp2 calculations.@xcite the sandwich structure dimer is similar with a recent calculation using this same nonlocal correlation functional@xcite in that the minimum energy point and the value of the binding energy at that point agree , but disagrees slightly at larger separations of the dimer .",
    "the results here used very large box sizes and very refined integration cutoff parameters .",
    "the results for benzene dimers in this work should be taken as the results generated from this methodology .",
    "_ before _ the horizontal displacement indicated in the insets .",
    "the third panel shows for comparison mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations,@xcite where the vertical and horizontal distances were increased simultaneously in a fixed ratio ( see text ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    in each case , we find that our calculations predict a significantly larger dimer separation , up to @xmath22 larger when compared with ccsd(t ) and mp2 .",
    "we find that our binding energies agree extremely well with the ccsd(t ) calculation for the magnitude of these binding energies , both of which are significantly less than those generated from the mp2 calculation .",
    "additionally , we agree with these previous calculations as well as more recent mp2 and ccsd(t ) calculations@xcite that , despite being nearly isoenergetic , the slip parallel is the lowest energy structure.@xcite    although the dimer separation ( @xmath23 ) is always given here as the distance from the center of the benzene rings regardless of the structure , in the slip parallel case the previous ccsd(t ) and mp2 results , with which we compare , were generated by fixing the angle between the center of mass line and the horizontal at @xmath24.@xcite in our calculation , we moved one benzene ring vertically and and then horizontally as in fig .",
    "1(c ) until we obtained a minimum .",
    "additionally , we moved one benzene ring at an angle of 30@xmath25 to this movement , but in the same plane ( fig .",
    "surprisingly , we found a significantly stronger binding energy when moving in this alternate direction , suggesting that the structure represented by fig .",
    "1(d ) is the lowest energy structure for the slip parallel geometry .",
    "this result is especially noteworthy as it represents a difference in stacking between the lowest energy structure of graphite and of the benzene dimer .",
    "although disagreeing with some previous assumed slip parallel structures,@xcite this geometry is actually similar to other previous studies@xcite including the structure found by recent and more complete ccsd(t ) calculations@xcite although no discussion or comparison was made with the alternate structure in these works .",
    "one of the major benefits of using the nonlocal correlation functional for organic , aromatic , and @xmath26-bonded systems is its compatibility with standard dft planewave codes and the relative speed and lack of computer power needed .",
    "indeed , these benzene dimers pushed ccsd(t ) nearly to its peak .",
    "even the less computationally demanding mp2-r12/a calculations were reported to have required two weeks on four processors.@xcite calculations of the later type are important , not only in their own right , but are also also often used as input for a clever procedure to extract a best estimate of the basis set limit for the even more demanding ccsd(t ) calculations .",
    "in contrast the the evaluation of @xmath6 done here took a time@xcite of the same order as corresponding gga calculation that proceeded it ( about an hour per point on a dual athalon mp 2000 + processor ) , and the former will take comparably less time as the system size increases .",
    "therefore , the benzene dimer represents a starting point for such systems within the present implementation , rather than nearly a limiting case as in ccsd(t ) .",
    "although another dft based methodology using symmetry - adapted perturbation theory@xcite is reported@xcite to have been recently optimized such as to offer comparable speeds for the benzene dimer , it nevertheless scales as the fifth power@xcite of the basis size , and hence in contradistinction to the present dft scheme , will rapidly become unmanageable as the system size increases .",
    "other coupled - cluster schemes such as those placing effort into linear scaling might also offer comparable speeds , but that such a scheme would generate consistent results in van der waals systems has not yet been indicated .",
    "therefore , this current methodology offers the only method we know that gives a calculation speed comparable to that of an ordinary gga calculation as the system size increases , and in order to utilize it fully , understanding the small disagreement of the predicted dimer separation in this work with the previous ccsd(t ) calculations is vital to increase the applicability of this method .",
    "the results of the vdw - df calculation when compared with the ccsd(t ) and mp2 results are quite illuminating .",
    "first we note that the binding energy values are extremely consistent with the ccsd(t ) results , much closer in the two minimum energy structures than the mp2 calculations . furthermore ,",
    "both these results are consistent with the ccsd(t ) results in that both show that the t - shape and the slip parallel structures to be nearly isoenergetic with the slip parallel slightly lower .",
    "this result is a strong indicator that this method might be the most efficient for calculating binding energies in van der waals systems .",
    "ccsd(t ) is considered the best and most complete answer to date but suffers from some serious scaling constraints as the system size increases .",
    "one can obtain useful results by using the best basis set possible , and then applying a clever method for estimating the basis set limit by making use of an mp2 calculation which can be made with a much larger basis set .",
    "the results used in our plots here@xcite used this method . a more recent calculation@xcite using this method with even a better basis set ( aug - cc - pvqz@xmath27 ) and using an mp2 calculation essentially at the basis set limit@xcite yields qualitatively similar results varying by a few tenths of a kcal / mol .",
    "thus when searching for alternatives , it is clear that our method gives closer energies to ccsd(t ) compared with mp2 at the basis set limit , while yielding inconsistent separations .",
    "unfortunately , in addition to these slightly larger separations , this method also gives an inconsistent result in that the sandwich structure is lower in energy than the t - shape structure . to understand why requires greater analysis .",
    "in addition to the interplay of all the typical interactions , the binding energy of benzene dimers is influenced by two competing interactions not necessarily as prominent as in other physical systems : the attractive dispersion interaction and the repulsive electrostatic quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "how any method deals with these two interactions , tiny when compared with their total energies , is thus vital in determining which structure it might favor .",
    "parallel structures , both the sandwich and the slip parallel , feature a more dominant quadrupole - quadrupole repulsion interaction than the t - shape structure , an interaction that tends to decrease the total binding energy when dispersion is not fully taken into account . if the counterbalancing dispersion interactions are neglected or only partially included , t - shape structures may then be found as the more stable structure .",
    "conversely , any method that underestimates quadrupole - quadrupole interactions such as dft based methods , or any method that overestimates nonlocal correlation effects , would bias the result towards favoring parallel structures .",
    "the mp2 perturbation method is a sensible method for dealing with these two effects in a controllable manner .",
    "the correlation energy calculated through the mp2 method counterbalances the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the completeness of the gaussian basis set used and the inclusion of disperse polarizability functions tends to increase the magnitude of the total electron correlation energy in mp2 calculations and thus the attractive dispersion interactions .",
    "as the basis sets are less complete , the dispersion energy will not compensate the electrostatic effect fully and t - shape structures will be found to be more favorable .",
    "methods based on multipole expansion@xcite and underconverged mp2 methods@xcite led to this exact trend in the 1980s and the early to mid 1990s .",
    "as the capability of performing calculations with a more converged basis set occurred , the planar geometries felt the effect to a greater degree , while the t - shape geometries changed in energy negligibly . eventually , the capability to do a converged basis set hf and mp2 calculation led to such an increase in binding energy ( more negative interaction energy ) for the planar structure , that planar geometries were recognized as the more favorable energy structure.@xcite    this historical analysis demonstrates how different methods will bias which nearly isoenergetic system will be found to be the lowest energy structure . in our case , we note that because the slip parallel dimer was found as the lowest energy structure , our method for including nonlocal correlation energy is consistent with the converged mp2 and the ccsd(t ) calculations , _ i.e. _ our nonlocal correlation functional captures an amount of correlation consistent with converged mp2 calculations . however , because we perform a dft calculation and use dft densities , the quadrupole moment is underestimated by @xmath28 to @xmath29,@xcite giving a quadrupole repulsion in the sandwich configuration that is substantially too small .",
    "thus our sandwich binding energies will be too large because not enough repulsion is considered , while the t - shape is largely unaffected because of the larger distances . because our t - shape binding energy predictions were less than @xmath30  kcal / mol weaker than the sandwich binding energy predictions",
    ", this may be one source of the physical discrepancy of the sandwich binding energy being found stronger than the t - shape binding energy .",
    "furthermore , this result also demonstrates a caveat for using this method when the principal interaction is electrostatic and not van der waals .",
    "possibly this defect could be corrected _ ad hoc _ by applying a density correction method@xcite as done in refs .   and , but we have not yet explored this possibility .",
    "any method that features a complete quadrupole - quadrupole interaction energy and dispersion energy may reveal that the t - shape is the more energetically favorable than the slip parallel , but clearly both distinct structures are local minimums and should thus both occur in nature .",
    "one trend that we observe is the consistent overestimation of dimer separation in benzene compared with ccsd(t ) .",
    "the possibility of this particular result being a specific trait of benzene and the use of the revpbe exchange energy are investigated as two potential explanations for this discrepancy .    with the lack of conclusive experimental equilibrium distances in gas phase benzene",
    ", we performed a similar comparison with a system that has a known experimental dimer separation .",
    "this comparison may also reveal if our overestimation of dimer separation is specific to benzene or a general trait of this methodology . to this end",
    ", we calculated the geometry and binding energy of the argon dimer .",
    "similar to the previous published results@xcite , we obtain a binding energy of 0.45  kcal / mol at 3.97    for the argon dimer . this equilibrium distance overestimates the accepted experimental dimer separation by @xmath31  0.2    or @xmath32 .",
    "unfortunately , this result is inconclusive in explaining our discrepancy in benzene as it still overestimates the accepted argon experimental value , but not nearly as much as the assumed overestimation in benzene .",
    "thus , we analyzed the effect of using revpbe exchange energies in our binding energy calculation .",
    "4 shows revpbe exchange binding energies compared with a hartree - fock calculation for the sandwich structure.@xcite for the sandwich structure , we see that revpbe is steeper than hf , and approaches zero more rapidly .",
    "these differences suggest that the revpbe energy , _ not _ the nonlocal correlation energy correction is responsible for the discrepancy in dimer separation with mp2 and ccsd(t ) .",
    "furthermore , the revpbe exchange results also appear to be responsible for the slow approach towards zero from below in the total binding energy .",
    "fig .  5 and fig .  6",
    "show the effect of using hartree fock as opposed to revpbe exchange on the total binding energy . in these results ,",
    "the correlation energy is not changed at all , simply the revpbe exchange - only energy is subtracted from the total energy and hf energy is added .",
    "both the dimer separation and the slow approach towards zero problems simultaneously disappear for the sandwich structure : the minimum displacement shifts inward by nearly 0.43    while the binding energy approaches zero from below more quickly and more consistently with the mp2 and ccsd(t ) result .",
    "also disappearing is the rather large energy difference between the two slip parallel equilibria , with the slip - parallel-2 geometry only 0.005 kcal / mol lower ( _ i.e. _ , more stable ) .",
    "unfortunately , the change in exchange energy tends to increase the magnitude of the binding energy , placing it further away from the ccsd(t ) calculations , although still comparable to the mp2 calculations . based on this result ,",
    "the very slight differences in revpbe with hartree - fock ( hf ) seem to be the root of most discrepancies , especially dimer separation , although revpbe is the most consistent exchange density functional of those tested@xcite for representing exchange - only effects .",
    "this difference can slightly alter equilibrium geometries in benzene dimers , and thus perhaps hf is a better starting point .",
    "we have redone our exchange only calculations for each benzene dimer with hf calculations instead of revpbe . in every case",
    ", we obtain a minimum point consistent with ccsd(t ) , and energies consistent with mp2 . additionally , as hf and revpbe differ in slightly different manners in each system , we find that the t - shape dimer now binds much more strongly than the sandwich dimer .",

    "in conclusion , we have applied a nonlocal correlation functional capable of describing dispersion interactions to the benzene dimer .",
    "we find that slip parallel is the lowest energy structure although all three geometries are nearly isoenergetic .",
    "our binding energies and qualitative predictions are consistent with ccsd(t ) and mp2 calculations , although , our equilibrium geometries are slightly larger ; however , the discrepancies in geometry are due to differences between revpbe and hf , not the nonlocal correlation energy functional .",
    "our method thus gives useful values for spacings and energies , at a tiny fraction of the cost of the wave function methods .",
    "specifically this cost is comparable to that for calculations of the gga type , which typically give sporadic and often unphysical results for systems whose properties depend on the long range van der waals interaction .",
