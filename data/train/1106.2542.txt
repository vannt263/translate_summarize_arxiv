    "profound fulfillment of this long - sought goal  the production of stellar cmds having extraordinary statistics over extensive angular coverage  is being provided by large - area surveys like the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 ) , and ukidss ( lucas et al .  2008 ) , and will be expected to continue with future endeavors like pan - starrs ( kaiser et al .",
    "2002 ) , the large synoptic survey telescope ( ivezic et al .  2008 ) , and sky - mapper ( keller et al .  2007 ) .",
    "however , a fundamental and unresolved difficulty with systematic explorations of the galaxy , despite the existence of huge databases of accurate photometry for billions of stars , is extinction by interstellar dust . this obstacle has thwarted astronomers dating back to herschel , struve ( 1847 ) , and kapteyn ( 1909 ) , and , despite having been initially quantified by trumpler ( 1930 ) 80 years ago , remains a roadblock to our detailed understanding of the inner mw and to the interpretation of cmds of its stars . while the reduced effects of dust on near infrared ( nir ) photometry have allowed us to take cmd - probing of the galaxy to dustier regions at lower latitudes , our view of the densest , but most important , parts of our galaxy is still challenged by heavy and non - uniform reddening and extinction , which typically renders low latitude field stellar cmds virtually uninterpretable in a stellar populations context .",
    "the problem is multi - faceted : ( 1 ) when beyond modest levels of extinction ( when , e.g. , @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 $ ] @xmath9 @xmath10 ) , the dust density is generally variable on angular scales smaller than the resolution of available reddening maps .",
    "( 2 ) existing reddening maps ( e.g. , burstein & heiles 1982 ; schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 , `` sfd '' hereafter ) are _ two dimensional _  they give only the _ total _ galactic extinction along a line of sight , not just that which is foreground to a particular star . at optical wavelengths , star - by - star dereddening from combined _ ubv _ colors is commonly attempted , but this technique is hampered in highly extinguished regions , where ( 3 ) the  standard galactic extinction law \" ( e.g. , savage & mathis 1979 , rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) ] no longer applies ( e.g. , cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , and where ( 4 ) the extinction pushes stars to substantially fainter magnitudes ( exacerbated by the fact that in such regions @xmath11 can exceed 5 ) . finally , ( 5 ) in many instances the process of dereddening the observed colors of a star back to their ( unknown ) intrinsic values is degenerate because the reddening vectors and the distribution of stars in color - color space are either parallel ( see  2 ) or intersect at multiple points ( e.g. , as in the case of _ ubv _ dereddening ) .",
    "some of these problems are lessened by moving to near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "for example , variations in the extinction law are typically considered to be less of a problem in the nir ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 , indebetouw et al .  2005 ; although we show elsewhere  zasowski et al .",
    "2009 , `` paper ii '' hereafter  that there do exist variations in the near- and mid - infrared extinction law that appear to be related to galactic gradients in dust grain size or composition ) . on the other hand ,",

    "jhk@xmath12 _ colors of a star back to the intrinsic values is severely degenerate between reddening and intrinsic stellar type ( particularly when both intrinsic and observational color scatter of stars along these loci is considered ) .",

    "the axis scales in each panel have been deliberately made identical for the purpose of highlighting the varying range of values spanned by each color.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    however , as we shall demonstrate , the combination of 2mass and _ spitzer_-irac photometry ( or any near- and mid - infrared dataset ) allows a direct and reliable assessment of the line of sight reddening to any particular star  and across wavelengths where the reddening law is more universal ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 , cardelli et al .",
    "1989  although not entirely so , paper ii ) .",
    "moreover , at these wavelengths , the color effects of reddening and stellar atmospheres are almost completely separable , an advantage that is the foundation of the present series of papers ( see  [ sec : rjce - context ] ) .      with trumpler s ( 1930 )",
    "determination that the observed brightnesses of stars are modulated by the presence of interstellar dust , a definitive explanation of the previously known ( e.g. , pik 1929 , gerasimovi 1929 ) but not understood phenomenon of stellar reddening  whereby a star has a measured color that is redder than expected for its spectral type  was at hand .",
    "pik ( 1931 ) explored several hypotheses for the origin of reddening ( as seen in early - type stars ) and concluded that absorption of light by interstellar dust clouds was the most probable explanation .",
    "soon an association of at least some of this selective absorption with dark clouds ( of the type photographed extensively and famously by e.  e.  barnard and s.  i.  bailey decades before ) was made through what may be the first published color excess ( i.e. , reddening ) maps across an individual cloud ( one associated with the open cluster ngc 663 ) by carol jane anger ( 1931 ) , and then across a general region ( cepheus ) by elvey & mehlin ( 1932 ) .",
    "these studies were soon followed by the first rudimentary large - scale maps of optical color excess as a function of longitude , latitude , and distance ( e.g. , elvey 1931 , zug 1933 , stebbins 1933 , stebbins & whitford 1936 ) , which immediately revealed the global non - uniformity of the distribution of the reddening particles .",
    "williams ( 1934 ) summarizes much of this early pioneering work .",
    "nevertheless , for decades researchers have been frequently tempted or forced to use simple assumptions about the distribution of dust  e.g. , the layered models giving rise to cosecant(@xmath17 ) laws , and/or spatial homogeneity leading to assumed linear relations of color excess with distance .    a correlation between the color excess and the total space absorption was subsequently identified , and soon the ratio between the selective and total extinction was quantified for different optical wavelengths ( e.g. , stebbins & whitford 1936 , greenstein & henyey 1941 ) , which led to the first attempts at defining the extinction law with wavelength ( stebbins , huffer & whitford 1939 ) . with a reliable extinction law ,",
    "observed color excesses could be translated back into total extinctions , a necessary step in mapping the distribution of both dust and stars in the galaxy .",
    "although alternative methods have been developed to measure line - of - sight extinction ( e.g. , through counts of background galaxies , or by mapping proxies for dust obscuration , such as the intensity of radiation by associated gas or thermal emission by the dust itself ) , use of color excesses have always provided the most reliable means by which to measure extinction along the line of sight to a star , and , specifically , _ foreground _ to that star .",
    "the use of infrared color excesses to calculate levels of dust extinction , taking advantage of the reduced influence of extinction at longer wavelengths , has a history primarily in the exploration and mapping of the extinction in dark ( i.e. , molecular ) clouds .",
    "for example , jones et al .  ( 1980 ) explored the observed distribution of @xmath18 and @xmath19 colors of stars in the direction of a specific bok globule in the coalsack nebula to estimate reddenings .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:2cd ] , the problem with this sort of analysis is the degeneracy between the nir reddening vector and the stellar locus for most spectral types , which leaves as generally inseparable the intrinsic colors of the stars versus the degree of reddening to each star .",
    "nevertheless , with infrared spectra for only a small fraction of their 75 tracer stars available to constrain the general types of stars in their photometric survey , jones et al .  estimated the radial variation in extinction ( derived through @xmath20 $ ] ) in the globule after assuming all stars to be of a specific spectral type ( m3 iii ) .",
    "a similar approach was applied by hyland ( 1981 ) to map six bok globules , by casali ( 1986 ) for another six , and by smith ( 1987 ) for the carina nebula .    while follow - up study of their bok globule by jones et al .",
    "( 1984 ) increased to several dozen the number of available spectra ( along with other data ) for classifying the stars and improving the reddening estimates , this effort only highlighted the labor - intensive nature of pairing photometry with spectroscopy on a star - by - star basis to break the degeneracies between intrinsic nir stellar colors and the reddening vectors .",
    "more recently , arce & goodman ( 1999b ) compare and summarize the quality various techniques for mapping extinction , and assert that the `` most exact method for measuring extinction [ is ] using the color excesses of individual stars with measured spectral type . ''",
    "however , as they point out , `` the real drawback of this technique is the large amount of time required to measure each and every star s spectrum . ''",
    "a reliable means by which to estimate stellar type and reddening _ from photometry alone _ would clearly allow much more flexibility and the ability to make and utilize large photometric surveys .",
    "the early dark cloud studies listed in  [ sec : early - ir ] , which undertook a `` statistical '' approach to deriving color excesses  i.e. , basically assuming an `` average '' intrinsic color for sources against which to estimate color excesses  were relatively successful because of their use of infrared data in highly reddened regions : the actual range of intrinsic nir colors of the stars was relatively narrow compared to the degree of reddening being mapped .",
    "an important development along this path of statistical ir reddening mapping was made by lada et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who , in their extensive study of the molecular cloud ic5146 , adopted an improved statistical approach to determining color excesses that they called the near - infrared color excess ( nice ) method . by focusing solely on stellar @xmath19 colors , lada et al .",
    "( 1994 ) were able to take advantage of the even more limited intrinsic stellar color range ( assumed by them as @xmath21 for stars with spectral types from a0 to late m  see also figure  [ fig : colhist ] below ) to substantially reduce uncertainty in derived nir reddening values for random field stars .",
    "these authors point out that even simply assuming that the average intrinsic color of field stars is @xmath22 leads to a maximum uncertainty in the ultimately derived total extinction , @xmath23 , of less than 2.5 magnitudes .",
    "however , while residual uncertainties in the extinction at the level of 2.5 mag may be sufficiently negligible in the study of dense molecular clouds reaching extinctions of @xmath23 = 40 mag , for mapping the more diffuse extinction of the typical interstellar medium , the large reddening - to - extinction conversion factor leads to severe fractional @xmath23 errors for a given @xmath24 error .",
    "it is possible to reduce uncertainties by averaging over many stars , but this can severely limit the resolution of the final extinction map .",
    "for example , lada et al .",
    "( 1994 ) spend considerable effort modeling their results to account for cloud structure fluctuations on scales smaller than the resolution of their maps ( which had 1.5 @xmath25 1.5 arcmin cells ; see also alves et al .",
    "1998 , lada , alves & lada 1999 , and arce & goodman 1999b ) .",
    "other disadvantages of the method ( at least from the standpoint of understanding individual clouds ) include the difficulty of understanding the relative placement of the stars along the line of sight , the potential for certain stars to suffer circumstellar extinction ( e.g. , dust shells ) , the varying density of stars on the sky , the non - constancy of stellar populations with position in the sky ( see especially arce & goodman 1999b and popowski et al .",
    "2003 on this point ) , the dilution of high extinction peaks because of averaging , and the requirement that the dispersion in the mean colors of stars in the control fields be significantly smaller than in the target field , since the latter serves as a limit on the ultimate uncertainties .",
    "all of these affect the usefulness of applying the nice method more broadly along the galactic plane ( alves et al .",
    "1998 , froebrich & del burgo 2006 ) .",
    "clearly , it would be much better to know the intrinsic color of _ each _ star to maximize the resolution of reddening maps to the scale of star - to - star spacing .",
    "lombardi & alves ( 2001 ) set out to generalize the lada et al .",
    "( 1994 ) nice method to take advantage of multi - band data ( specifically , _",
    "jhk@xmath12 _ data from 2mass ) and introduced the nicer ( near - infrared color excess  revisited ) technique . in their specific application ,",
    "lombardi & alves use both @xmath18 and @xmath26 colors and the nicer technique to make extinction maps over a large area ( 625 deg@xmath27 ) around the orion and mon r2 region . in principle , the main problem with including @xmath4-band photometry in these color excess methods is the larger scatter in intrinsic @xmath28 colors for stars , which is more than three times larger than in @xmath29 ( girardi et al .",
    "2002 ; see also figures  [ fig : colhist]b and [ fig : colhist - tri]b below ) . however , lombari & alves argue that the complication of including the larger intrinsic scatter brought by incorporating @xmath18 colors in the analysis is offset by the typically smaller uncertainties one encounters in @xmath4 band photometry compared to @xmath30 , as well as the smaller numerical ratio of @xmath31 compared to @xmath32 ( they used 9.35 versus 15.87 ; rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) , which diminishes the effect of color excess uncertainties once converted to total extinctions .",
    "the nicer method seeks to balance these trade - offs between @xmath33 and @xmath34 derived maps with an optimization via maximum likelihood ; however , the method is still intrinsically based on taking advantage of _ average _ field star colors , assuming constancy of that mean color with position in the sky , and spatially smoothing over numerous stars to create each `` pixel '' in a map .",
    "thus , for example , the lombardi & alves map of the orion cloud yielded some regions with `` negative extinction '' owing to the presence of many contaminating blue stars from the open cluster ngc 2204 .",
    "nevertheless , lombardi & alves show that for the same angular resolution , the nicer method yields less noisy extinction maps that are more sensitive to lower extinction than the nice method using @xmath26 colors alone .",
    "this group has successfully applied the same methodology to explore the pipe nebula ( lombardi , alves & lada 2006 ) and the ophiuchus and lupus cloud complexes ( lombardi , lada & alves 2008 ) .",
    "more recently , gosling et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have updated the nicer method to include a variable extinction law ; they apply their `` v - nice '' method to understanding the nuclear bulge , assuming as their baseline intrinsic colors some mean @xmath18 and @xmath26 colors of g , k , and m stars .      as implied in ",
    "[ sec : impact - dust ] , a primary motivation for our investigation of improved dereddening methods derives from an interest in stellar populations and galactic structure , a fact that shapes our dereddening strategy and desired data products . to these ends",
    "we have developed the rayleigh - jeans color excess ( rjcerais@xmath35 ) . ] ) method , which builds on and contrasts with previous reddening studies in the following ways :    * as with numerous investigations stretching back to the 1930s (  [ sec : color - excess ] ) , we use stellar color excesses to gauge the amount of foreground dust . *",
    "like nice , nicer , v - nice and related studies (  [ sec : nice - r ] ) , we rely on _ infrared _ colors to measure the excesses because these can be gauged more reliably due to the narrower intrinsic color range of stars at these wavelengths .",
    "this reason is of course in addition to the advantageous facts that infrared extinction is both weaker than optical extinction ( which allows greater distances to be explored in dusty regions ) and the extinction law is less variable with wavelength and environment than that at shorter wavelengths . *",
    "similar to the imara & blitz ( 2006 ) , froebrich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , rowles & froebrich ( 2009 ) , dobashi et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2009 ) , and gosling et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studies (  [ sec : nice - r ] ) , we are interested in _ large - scale mapping _ of dust ( reddening ) around the galaxy  i.e. , not just that around specific clouds , but also down to rather low dust column densities where a high precision method is required to assess the color excesses .",
    "* however , because the stars themselves are a primary interest , we are not content with simply assuming their intrinsic photometric properties as in most of the large - scale , statistical studies ; rather , we want to _ measure _ these properties .",
    "the stars are not just a means to an end ( i.e. , evaluating and understanding the dust ) to be averaged over ; rather , the distribution and properties of the stars are end goals in themselves . by accurately reproducing the intrinsic color - magnitude distributions of the stars",
    ", we can learn about the distribution of stellar populations within the galaxy ( with a particular emphasis on the much more obscured and less well - studied populations at low latitudes ) , as well as the density laws of the dusty inner milky way via photometric isolation of various `` standard candles . '' as a bonus , with accurate knowledge of the 3-dimensional distribution of stellar types , we can in turn hope to map the 3-dimensional distribution of the dust itself . * because we seek an accurate means to attain accurate _",
    "star - by - star foreground reddening _ ( as opposed to statistically - assessed , area - averaged , line - of - sight reddening ) , the desired method to deal with extinction must gauge the reddening to each star and , at the same time , recover that star s intrinsic photometric properties .",
    "* the rjce method we describe meets this requirement , and we believe it is the first technique to utilize a combination of near - infrared ( nir ) _ and _ mid - infrared ( mir ) photometry for dereddening on a large scale . by exploiting these combined wavelengths , he color effects of reddening and stellar atmospheres can be almost completely separated : the _ observed _ nir - mir colors contain information on the foreground reddening to a star _",
    "explicitly _ , whereas the nir - only seds ( especially those using the @xmath4-band filter ) contain information on the stellar types . again , previous extinction studies using solely nir photometry can not achieve this separability because of the degeneracy of the reddening vector and the intrinsic distribution of stellar nir colors . * unlike previous studies , the rjce methodology includes both an accurate , star - by - star dereddening procedure as well as a second step of recovering and exploiting the recovered intrinsic stellar spectral types for further improvements in our understanding of the distributions of both the stars and dust .",
    "the dereddening step of the rjce methodology builds upon the advances achieved with the nice method  and , moreover , allows us to take color excess dereddening from the realm of a statistical to a star - by - star procedure  because of two factors : first , the degeneracy between nir stellar colors and reddening vectors is virtually eliminated as one moves to longer wavelength photometry .",
    "this is evident , for example , through comparison of the reddening vector and stellar locus for the most relevant spectral types shown in figures  [ fig:2cd]c and [ fig:2cd]d . for k and m",
    "type dwarfs , these are actually extremely rare stellar types in large infrared surveys like 2mass and glimpse , due to their intrinsic faintness .",
    "this can be seen later in figure  [ fig:2cd - tri ] , which is the same as figure  [ fig:2cd ] but for a model galactic mid - plane field as might be observed with glimpse ; that example shows no representation by late type dwarfs . ] but a second key feature that mir photometry  such as that afforded by irac on the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    " adds to the galactic structure toolbox is the measurement of fluxes on what is ostensibly the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of most stars . in the limit that stellar atmospheres radiate as perfect blackbodies , their colors are all the same across the mir bands for most stellar temperatures ( spectral types )",
    "; this means that observed departures from this standard color _ directly and explicitly _ reflect reddening by dust .",
    "we show below that even in the case of real stellar atmospheres , the flux ratios across the various mir color combinations , even including the reddest nir bands , are generally constant enough across stellar types ( i.e. , the color variations are small enough ) so as to make the rjce method remarkably robust .",
    "figure  [ fig : models ] shows realistic stellar seds ( i.e. , non - blackbody models ) and their uniformity of slope at mir wavelengths , and illustrates the degree to which we can expect nearly - identical colors for most normal stars with long - wavelength and long - baseline filter combinations .",

    "are generally _ not _ degenerate with the stellar locus for most stars typically encountered ( e.g. , compare reddening vectors in figures  [ fig:2cd]c and [ fig:2cd]d with that in [ fig:2cd]a )",
    ". other combinations of nir - mir filters than those shown in figure  [ fig:2cd ] also show promising degrees of orthogonality between the reddening vector and stellar locus , and , in theory , one could use the combination of many nir - mir color combinations to determine the reddening to a star .",
    "this procedure would be equivalent to performing , e.g. , a least squares fit to the linear combination of the infrared extinction law ( i.e. , scaling all color excesses to a common reddening , say , @xmath37@xmath7@xmath38 $ ] ) and the sed of the stellar type at the intersection of the reddening vector and the stellar locus . as demonstrated by figure  [ fig:2cd]c , for most typically - encountered stellar types",

    "we demonstrate the efficacy of this particular , simple , single - color version of rjce dereddening below ( figure  [ fig : sfd_cmd ] ) , but investigation of other combinations of colors ( some also explored below ) show that this procedure works more or less for any combination of nir - mir filters sampling the rayleigh - jeans part of seds ( e.g. , @xmath42 , @xmath30 , [ 3.6@xmath1 , [ 4.5@xmath1 , but not @xmath4 ) , so that it is possible to make multiple , independent measures of the reddening for each star in this way .    in future papers we plan to discuss in detail the effects of the ( small ) intrinsic color variations in stars , as well as to optimize methods for taking advantage of multiple color data . here",
    "we focus on a couple of example variants of the rjce method and compare extinction maps made with rjce and 2mass+glimpse - detected stars to those made using other infrared excess dereddening methods (  [ sec : cp - maps ] ) and dust tracers (  [ sec : cp - othermethods ] ) .",

    "it is also obvious that greater overall extinction levels are detected in the more deeply probing ( [ 3.6@xmath1-[4.5@xmath1 ) map .    ) made by the rjce method , with use of the ( a ) @xmath39)$ ] colors and ( b ) @xmath92-[4.5\\mu])$ ] colors as the selective extinction measure ( where we have adopted @xmath92-[4.5\\mu])_0 $ ] = -0.1 as the baseline rayleigh - jeans stellar color ) . in each case , the stars used are those satisfying a 0.5 mag photometric uncertainty limit in only the two filters used in the color - excess measurement .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    while the example shown in figure  [ fig : rjce - diff ] might suggest exclusive use of mir ( e.g. , irac ) photometry as the ideal solution to creating extinction maps , there are several mitigating factors that need to be considered : ( 1 ) as shown in figures  [ fig : colhist ] and [ fig : colhist - tri ] , the intrinsic ( [ 3.6@xmath1-[4.5@xmath1)@xmath59 color range of stars is apparently wider than , say , that of longer wavelength baseline nir - mir colors , like @xmath39)_0 $ ] and @xmath93)_0 $ ] . of course , this might be overcome by the use of longer wavelength combinations of mir filters .",
    "however , the glimpse photometric uncertainties at 5.8@xmath2 m and 8@xmath2 m ( irac channels 3 and 4 ) are greater than at 3.6@xmath2 m and 4.5@xmath2 m , the contribution from dust continuum emission is more significant , and the extinction law ( @xmath94/@xmath95 ) at these wavelengths is significantly more variable throughout the galactic disk ( paper ii ) . ( 2 ) because of the still relatively narrow intrinsic color spread for stars in mir colors , like @xmath92-[4.5\\mu])$ ] , there is virtually no stellar type information that can be gleaned for normal stars using mir colors _",
    "only_. thus , one loses almost all stellar population information ( i.e. , there is no useful cmd in these filters ) that one could use to prune one s tracer sample to specific tracers ( e.g. , the intrinsically brightest , farthest stars at each magnitude ) .",
    "( 3 ) being more weakly affected by dust means that the mir has less sensitivity to low levels of extinction , where it will generally be less reliable at deriving @xmath62 for a given precision in the photometry .",
    "all of these suggest that hybrid schemes , whereby nir+mir ( e.g , 2mass+glimpse ) photometry is used for low extinction regions and mir photometry alone is used in higher extinction regions ( where the nir photometry is limited in reach ) might be the most optimal way to utilize color - excess extinction mapping when depending on databases like 2mass and glimpse .",
    "obviously , with the advent of deeper , publicly - available nir surveys in the future ( such as ukidss ) , the limitations of the nir photometry seen here can be mitigated ; given the limited sky coverage for high - resolution mir photometry , such surveys have the capability of improving the extinction reach of nice - like mapping , which can be used outside of the regions probed by irac .",
    "of course , as discussed at length in  [ sec : cp - cmds ] , higher precision color - excess dereddening will always be obtained by combining nir and mir photometry .",
    "the recent and future releases of the wise all - sky mir photometry ( wright et al .",
    "2010 ) will provide an opportunity to apply reliable rjce extinction mapping and cmd corrections across the entire sky , particularly in out - of - plane , high - reddening regions not observed with _ spitzer_-irac .",
    "in  [ sec : cp - maps ] we showed and compared extinction maps created by various ir color excess methods .",
    "these comparisons only give indications of the relative performance of these maps with respect to one another . but are such maps reliable indicators of dust distributions in the first place ? in this section",

    "we conclude not only that the rjce - generated maps are reliable indicators of the two - dimensional distribution of dust down to rather fine scales , but also that the rjce method currently may well be the most reliable means to generate extinction maps on small and large scales .",

    "even small - scale and filamentary features such as the structured cloud between @xmath98 and above @xmath99 , or the smaller knot at @xmath100 , are prominent in both .",
    "the most significant differences between the maps are where , near the @xmath3co peak intensities , the rjce extinction map appears to have `` holes '' ; this is precisely the problem discussed in  [ sec : limits ] , and one which can be ameliorated by the strategic use of irac - only maps , at least for these high extinction regions .",
    "the close correspondence between @xmath3co emission and high dust extinction is not surprising .",

    "however , neither of these conditions is generally applicable to the galactic midplane , particularly towards the inner galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we do see reasonable ( inverse ) correlation between starcounts and rjce - derived extinction , particularly in regions of high extinction , because of the increasing loss of stars behind the denser dust complexes ( as in  [ sec : limits ] ) .    this correspondence offers reassurance that our maps are not significantly affected by foreground ( low - reddening ) dwarf contaminants , and that even a small number of stars behind a cloud is sufficient to make a reasonable estimate of the line - of - sight extinction through the cloud ( e.g. , @xmath49 \\sim [ 20.8,0.5]^\\circ$ ] ) . a close comparison of figures  [ fig : cp - maps2]b and [ fig : cp - maps2]e also allows one to see where the rjce extinction map is limited due to a lack of background stars  these `` emptier '' patches of sky ( e.g. , near @xmath49 \\sim [ 23.3,-0.3]^\\circ$ ] or @xmath104^\\circ$ ] ) show the location of particularly dense cores",

    "for example , there are prominent features in the rjce map that do not appear in the sfd map , and their absence is not simply due to being blurred out by the lower resolution .",
    "the patchy feature at @xmath113 , the small but distinct cloud at @xmath100 , and the large swathe of extinction from @xmath98 and above @xmath99 are examples of the variety of features plainly seen in the rjce map ( figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]b ) but missing in the sfd map ( figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]a ) , whereas these same features are clearly visible in the completely independent @xmath3co map shown in figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]c (  [ sec : rjce - vs - co ] ) , demonstrating that these structures are real . on the other hand , several bright knots in the sfd map _ not _ appearing in the rjce map  e.g. , those at @xmath47 = @xmath114 and @xmath115  also do not stand out strongly in the @xmath3co map , supporting the notion that their non - appearance in the rjce map is not just a result of stars being extinguished out of these maps .",
    "that the starcount map in figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]e (  [ sec : rjce - vs - stcnts ] ) shows no special depression in counts at these positions is further support of this assertion .",
    "many of the differences between the sfd and rjce maps may be readily explained by comparing figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]a to figure  [ fig : cp - maps2]d , which is the irac [ 8@xmath1 image of this glimpse region (  [ sec : rjce - vs-8um ] ) and which bears a striking resemblance to the sfd map .",
    "the mir image shows clearly that many of the  high extinction knots \" appearing in the sfd map are due to the presence of supernova remnants , star - forming regions , and other knots of hii , which are strongly affecting the far infrared emission in the dirbe maps at these localized positions . on the other hand ,",
    "features that are missing from the sfd map but found in the rjce maps ( e.g. , those mentioned above ) as well as the co maps ( which are good proxies for the presence of colder dust ) clearly demonstrate that there are strongly light - extinguishing dust clouds sufficiently cold to have only faint fir emission , or none at all .    in summary , very close correlations are found among the rjce extinction map , the @xmath3co emission map , and the 2mass stellar density map , the latter two expected to be reasonable tracers of extinction by cold dust ( for stellar density , only in fairly crowded regions ) . in contrast , significant differences are seen between the quantity and distribution of rjce extinction and the reddening derived from 100@xmath2 m dust emission , the latter which is much more closely correlated with the 8@xmath2 m hot dust emission , such as that from sn remnants and hii regions . from these comparisons , we conclude that rjce directly and reliably traces interstellar extinction on fine scales .",
    "we also emphasize the complexity of dust behavior , and the need for studies to consider the suitability of available extinction corrections to the observations being corrected .",
    "one goal of this paper is to make the case that the rjce dereddening technique holds great promise as a new tool for galactic structure ( of , in particular , the low - latitude galaxy ) , interstellar medium , and stellar population studies . in forthcoming papers ,",
    "we aim to refine and exploit the methodology for these purposes .    among the applications we intend for rjce",
    "are ( 1 ) continual improvements in the systematic two - dimensional mapping of total dust extinction at low latitudes , by extending the work shown in figure  [ fig : cp - maps2 ] and offered in our first generation , public - release maps described in paper iii .",
    "in addition , by exploiting the stellar populations information that is preserved via use of the rjce method , reliable photometric parallaxes can be inferred for large numbers of different stellar tracers .",
    "this enables one to ( 2 ) extend the mapping of galactic dust into _ three _ dimensions , and , of course , ( 3 ) effectively map the 3-dimensional distribution of stars across the disk , bulge , and bar of the galaxy , with the hope of unveiling in greater detail the shapes and substructure of these dust - enshrouded milky way features .",
    "we preview work toward both of these latter goals below .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing again the usefulness of rjce - dereddened cmds for identifying specific types of stars across the inner galaxy , a desirable feature for assembling homogeneous samples for further study ; this stellar type discrimination of rjce is an advantage that we are exploiting in , e.g. , the selection of red giant stars for spectroscopic study via the new apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) as part of the sloan digital sky survey iii ( majewski et al .  2010 ) .      while the comparisons in  [ sec : cp - maps ] suggest that the rjce methodology performs slightly better than that of the nice family for two - dimensional dust mapping , the real advantages of rjce accrue when one considers that this latter method retains sensitivity to stellar type information and luminosity class (  [ sec : cp - cmds ] ) .",
    "the ability to sort stars as , say , ms versus rc versus rgb type ( via their position in the rjce - dereddened cmd ) allows one to key on stars probing a wide range of different distances . as a demonstration of the potential distance sensitivity and the hope for mapping the three dimensional distribution of dust in the galaxy , figure  [ fig : pop - maps ] shows rjce - derived extinction maps spanning @xmath116 @xmath13 @xmath117 @xmath13 @xmath118 for rgb stars ( panel a ) , less distant rc stars ( panel b ) , and even less distant ms stars ( panel c ) . to make these maps , all stars in this region ( with _ jhk@xmath12 _ and [ 4.5@xmath1 photometric uncertainty @xmath13 0.5 mag )",

    "comparison of the three maps reveals a variety of cloud structures that lie between the typical distances of the rgb stars ( @xmath3618 - 20 kpc ) , the rc stars ( @xmath368 kpc ) , and the ms stars ( @xmath363 kpc ) used in these maps .",
    "for example , the cloud clearly visible in the rgb map at @xmath119 does not appear in the ms map or even the rc map , which indicates that it is a distant feature beyond the extent of the rc stellar sample .",

    "the net slopes for each of these dispersion trends are equal to or lower than in the case of using all stars ( compare to figure  [ fig : disp ] ) , and we see that the slope of the trends drops as we proceed from ms and rc star tracers ( slope of 0.34 ) to rgb stars ( slope of 0.28 ) .",

    "in addition , we note a trend between the spread of dispersion and approximate distance of the stellar tracers  for example , the relatively close - by ms stars have the tightest spread , because for a fixed angular pixel size , the spatial volume probed is smaller and therefore less likely to be impacted by sub - pixel - scale dust structures . figure  [ fig : pop - disp ] demonstrates once more that use of predominantly rgb tracers appears to be the most effective way to improve the reliability of two - dimensional extinction maps in the galactic plane .      in the previous section we showed , as an example , a general statistical method for gauging the rough distances to large dust features by taking advantage of the varying typical distances of stars in maps made by different types of stellar dust tracers .",

    "figure  [ fig : diskedge2 ] illustrates this point . in the top row of panels , with midplane stars at @xmath117 @xmath36 340@xmath80 , the lower edge of the stellar distribution in the left - hand panel follows closely the dashed line indicating the approximate survey detection limits .",
    "( the limits shown here are for ideal , unconfused fields ; the source confusion present in low latitude fields may account for the actually observed , brighter limit , but note that the slope of the limit is identical to the apparent cutoff slope of the data . )",
    "when the cmd is dereddened and an isochrone fitted , the stars being fit at the edge of the rgb are largely those lying near the detection limit ( denoted by dark blue colors in the right - hand panel ) ; this indicates that while the isochrone may in fact provide a reasonable estimate of the age / metallicity / distance of the stars , those stars are not probing the physical edge of the galactic disk . as a contrast",
    ", we show in the bottom panels the same cmds for a midplane field at @xmath117 @xmath51260@xmath80 ; even in the uncorrected cmd , it is clear that the majority of rgb stars at the faintest magnitudes for each color do not have apparent brightnesses approaching the survey limit ( confirmed by the colors of those stars in the lower right panel ) , so we may be confident that in this field , the fitted isochrone is actually measuring stars at the outermost extent of the disk .    ) @xmath51 ( 340,0)@xmath80 , showing the most reddened stars approaching the survey detection limits ( dashed line ) .",
    "the _ center _ and _ right _ panels both show the rjce - corrected cmd , but the coloring in the right - hand panel indicates the average offset of the stars from the survey magnitude limit ( dashed line ) in uncorrected color - magnitude space , measured along a reddening vector . in this scheme ,",
    "dark blue indicates stars very close to the survey limit , and red indicates stars far removed from the limit . _",
    "bottom : _ same plots as above , but for ( @xmath131 ) @xmath51 ( 260,0)@xmath80 , a less - reddened field where the rgb extent is limited by the disk edge only . in the dereddened cmds ,",
    "the dotted lines are the best - fit isochrones , shifted to the best - fit `` edge '' distances.,scaledwidth=33.0% ]    the most important implications of this simple isochrone fitting procedure are twofold .",
    "first , we are able to indicate at which longitudes our integrated extinction maps likely explore the actual total galactic extinction ( from figure  [ fig : diskedge ] , we assess this to be @xmath132 ) , as well as the approximate distances probed by the inner galaxy maps .",
    "second , the isochrones fitting those rgbs that _ do _ sample the edge of the galactic disk can provide a measurement of the stellar characteristics and distances of the edge of the galaxy .",
    "we will explore and refine this method in future work , but even this simple interpretation of the cmd in terms of the galactic distribution of disk stars demonstrates the potential of systematically exploring properly dereddened cmds for a better understanding of the galactic midplane s stellar populations .",
    "we approach the well - tested method of using ir color excesses to calculate foreground dust extinction from a new angle  we combine near- and mid - infrared photometry ( 2mass + _",
    "spitzer_-irac ) to trace reddening in a way far less dependent on assumptions of stellar type than previous studies have been .",
    "this rayleigh - jeans color excess ( rjce ) technique is a major improvement over previous variants because it samples starlight on the rayleigh - jeans portion of the stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , where the vast majority of stellar seds have a common shape .",
    "thus , our method is far less susceptible to variations in intrinsic stellar colors , so that measured color excess are much better matches to the true reddening of the star .",
    "the rjce method makes it possible to measure rather accurately the amount of selective and total extinction foreground to any particular star .",
    "one of the most significant improvements made by rjce is that the reddening corrections it provides are virtually completely independent of the intrinsic color for most stars .",
    "thus , application of the method preserves intrinsic stellar colors and allows restoration of the _ intrinsic _ color - magnitude diagram with high fidelity  in essence , allowing recovery of the intrinsic stellar types through photometry alone .",
    "we show that using this additional step of the rjce method in heavily - reddened midplane fields produces a nir color - magnitude distribution extraordinarily similar to that predicted by a zero - reddening galactic model ; in contrast , the stellar type assumptions required by other color excess methods based on only nir photometry ( the nice and nicer methods ) result in unphysical color - magnitude distributions and a loss of stellar type information .",
    "the availability of color - magnitude diagrams free of reddening for even very dusty , galactic midplane lines of sight with highly variable extinction opens up unprecedented opportunities for stellar population studies of the inner , low - latitude galaxy .",
    "the rjce - generated extinction maps are compared with numerous other proxies for dust extinction : the 100@xmath2 m @xmath53 map by schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ; sfd ) , the @xmath3co emission map from the galactic ring survey ( jackson et al .",
    "2006 ) , the 8@xmath2 m dust emission image from the glimpse program using _ spitzer_-irac ( benjamin et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the 2mass star counts of the same region .",
    "we find poor correlation with the @xmath53 map of sfd .",
    "this is because of the lower resolution of the sfd maps , strong variations in the optical extinction law , the fact that the sfd maps represent total line - of - sight extinction ( not extinction foreground to each star ) , and , as has been demonstrated before by previous authors , that the sfd maps overestimate the reddening at low latitudes .",
    "most importantly , the poor correlation between sfd and rjce maps shows that infrared emitting dust , which provides the basis of the sfd extinction maps , is not a good proxy for infrared extinguishing dust .    on the other hand",
    ", we find an excellent match , down to even fine filamentary features , between rjce - generated @xmath133 maps and maps of the molecular @xmath3co emission .",
    "clearly the @xmath3co molecules and light - extinguishing dust grains are closely linked ; in future work we aim to explore this correlation more quantitatively .",
    "this striking correspondence between the @xmath3co and rjce - generated @xmath133 maps confirms that the latter are able to trace light - extinguishing dust on very small angular scales and that rjce maps should provide a more accurate measurement of the interstellar extinction in the galactic midplane than the sfd maps . to this end , we provide in paper iii a version 1 release of extinction maps for those regions covered by the glimpse - i and vela - carina surveys , using the @xmath39)$]-based rjce techniques described here .",
    "we intend to extend and improve these maps as our program evolves .",
    "we also explore the photometric limitations of the 2mass+irac catalog and the effect of these limitations on our derived extinction maps , especially in the most highly extinguished lines of sight .",
    "it is demonstrated how , with either deeper nir photometry or exclusive use of mir photometry , this generally minor drawback ( in terms of fraction of the sky affected ) can be overcome .",
    "we explore the various nir+mir color combinations to identify those expected to make the rjce technique the most effective , and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of single- versus hybrid - color schemes in its application .    among these opportunities provided by the rjce method s `` second step ''  the recovery of intrinsic stellar types  is the ability to cleanly discriminate various types of stellar population tracers .",
    "for example , in low latitude nir cmds three main stellar types are most evident : main sequence , red clump and red giant branch stars .",
    "rjce - dereddening allows relatively pure samples of these tracers to be isolated , and , to the extent that these stellar types are standard candles , enables the mapping of both dust and stellar distributions in three dimensions .",
    "we preview this exciting new capability by showing extinction maps generated independently for these specific stellar populations  each of which probes distinctly different distance ranges for 2mass+irac data  and finding examples of cloud formations that can be isolated to specific distances .",
    "maps of this type for the full glimpse - i and vela - carina survey areas are described in paper iii . as a second example , the 2mass+irac cmds are analyzed over a wide longitude range , with many showing strong evidence that their rgbs sample the outer edge of the milky way stellar disk ; we measure this edge for @xmath134 and find it to be consistent with a galactocentric distance of 1215 kpc , or @xmath3645 disk radial scalelengths .",
    "there are many opportunities for application and improvement of the rjce methodology , and a broad program of experiments is planned .",
    "one is to improve the rjce extinction estimates using a more refined treatment of stellar properties ; this will be aided by the upcoming apogee survey , which will allow us to compare rjce - derived stellar types to spectroscopically - determined ones .",
    "we are evaluating the benefit of of optimized `` hybrid''-color schemes where high extinction limits the usefulness of nir photometry .",
    "we have already taken advantage of our data set to measure the extinction behavior as a function of wavelength throughout the midplane ( paper ii ) , and work is under way to provide rjce extinction maps for public use ( paper iii , in preparation ) and to use the new , reliably - cleaned cmds to explore galactic structure in previously - hidden segments of the galaxy .",
    "we thank r.  indebetouw and m.  f.  skrutskie for helpful discussions , m.  meade and b.  babler for their efforts to reduce the vela - carina dataset using the glimpse pipeline , and j.  k.  carlberg and the anonymous referee for comments and advice that have greatly improved the clarity of the paper .",

    "<S> the milky way ( mw ) remains a primary laboratory for understanding the structure and evolution of spiral galaxies , but typically we are denied clear views of mw stellar populations at low galactic latitudes because of extinction by interstellar dust . however , the combination of 2mass near - infrared ( nir ) and _ spitzer_-irac mid - infrared ( mir ) photometry enables a powerful method for determining the line of sight reddening to any star : the sampled wavelengths lie in the rayleigh - jeans part of the spectral energy distribution of most stars , where , to first order , all stars have essentially the same intrinsic color . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changes in stellar nir - mir colors due to interstellar reddening are readily apparent , and ( under an assumed extinction law ) the observed colors and magnitudes of stars can be easily and accurately restored to their intrinsic values , greatly increasing their usefulness for galactic structure studies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explore this `` rayleigh - jeans color excess '' ( rjce ) method and demonstrate that use of even a simple variant of the rjce method based on a single reference color , ( @xmath0[4.5@xmath1 ) , can rather accurately remove dust effects from previously uninterpretable 2mass color - magnitude diagrams of stars in fields along the heavily reddened galactic mid - plane , with results far superior to those derived from application of other dereddening methods . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that `` total '' galactic midplane extinction looks rather different from that predicted using 100@xmath2 emission maps from the iras / issa and cobe / dirbe instruments as presented by schlegel et al . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the galactic mid - plane extinction strongly resembles the distribution of @xmath3co ( @xmath4=1@xmath50 ) emission . </S>",
    "<S> future papers will focus on refining the rjce method and applying the technique to understand better not only dust and its distribution , but the distribution of stars intermixed with the dust in the low - latitude galaxy . </S>"
