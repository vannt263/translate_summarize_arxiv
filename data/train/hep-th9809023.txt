    "general axial gauges ( gags ) @xcite have been studied extensively within the few last decades @xcite .",
    "their main feature is the decoupling of the ghost sector since the fadeev - popov determinant no longer depends on the gauge field .",
    "this reduces the number of possible vertices significantly , and is a major simplification from a technical point of view . furthermore , unlike covariant gauges , gags do not suffer from the possible presence of gribov copies .",
    "however , they need the introduction of an additional lorentz vector @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", one has to cope with more structure functions per vertex due to the richer lorentz structure , which partly spoils the above advantages .",
    "the key obstacles , however , are the so - called spurious divergences of the perturbative propagator .",
    "these singularities are of the form @xmath1 and have to be regulated separately .",
    "they can be interpreted as a remnant of the gauge fixing being incomplete , which leaves the quadratic part of the gauge - fixed action not fully invertible . in the sequel",
    ", we will argue that the wilsonian ( or exact ) renormalisation group ( rg ) @xcite-@xcite is an appropriate alternative framework for this problem .",
    "it is self - contained , it allows for non - perturbative approximations , and -most importantly- the spurious divergences are naturally absent .",
    "to begin with , let us introduce the gauge fixing term for a gag as [ gf ] s_gf=12d^dx  n_a^a _  1n^2  n_a^a _ in a @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "it is quadratic in the gauge field , and the gauge fixing parameter @xmath3 with mass dimension @xmath4 may even be momentum dependent . for the following considerations , fermions act as spectators .",
    "therefore we can restrict ourselves to the purely gluonic part of the action , which is s_a&=&14d^dx  f_^a f_^a + f_^a&=&_a^a_-_a^a_+ g f^a _   bc a^b_a^c _ _ + d^ab_&=&^ab_+ g f^acba^c _ ,  [ t^b , t^c]=f_a^bct^a",
    ". the perturbative gluonic propagator @xmath5 can be decomposed on a basis of symmetric lorentz tensors as a_1+a_2 + a_3 + a_4 .",
    "[ prop_k ] the dimensionless coefficients @xmath6 as obtained from the gauge - fixed classical action @xmath7 are a_1&=&1[a1 ] + a_2&=&(1+p^2)/s^2 + a_3&=&-1 + a_4&=&0[a4 ] + s^2&=&(np)^2/n^2p^2 .",
    "@xmath5 displays the usual ir poles proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we observe divergences for momenta orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "these poles appear explicitly up to second order in @xmath9 and can even be of higher order for certain @xmath10-dependent choices of @xmath3 . for the planar gauge , @xmath11 , the spurious divergences appear only up to first order . within perturbation theory ,",
    "quantum corrections are computed in a loop expansion , with the bare propagator @xmath5 appearing in the loop integrals .",
    "the question about how to regularise @xmath5 such as to allow for a consistent loop expansion stimulated extensive investigations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the intricacies concerning these regularisations partly spoil the advantage of having fewer diagrams to calculate .",
    "furthermore , it is not fully established whether the proposed regularisation schemes are consistent at higher loop order .",
    "a very promising tool for studying both perturbative and non - perturbative aspects of quantum field theories is given by the wilsonian or exact renormalisation group @xcite-@xcite .",
    "its formulation , as presented for example in @xcite , relies on the presence of a scale dependent regulator term @xmath12 .",
    "it is aimed at ( i ) regulating possible ir divergences and ( ii ) integrating - out momentum shells of quantum fluctuations around @xmath13 .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath14 can be interpreted as a coarse - graining scale .",
    "k s[a ] =  a^a_r^ab_k,(p ) a^b _ , [ cut - off1 ] which is quadratic in the fields .",
    "the related scale dependent effective action @xmath15 $ ] can be shown to interpolate between the gauge - fixed classical action as given at some initial uv scale @xmath16 , @xmath17+s_{\\rm gf}[a]$ ] , and the full quantum effective action @xmath18 .",
    "it obeys the flow equation [ flow ] _",
    "t_k[a]= \\{g_k[a ] } . here , the trace sums over all momenta and indices , @xmath19 , and [ prop ] g_k,^ab=(+r_k,^ab ) ^-1 denotes the full ( _ i.e. _  field - dependent , regularised ) propagator .",
    "a typical regulator with the required properties is given by r^ab_k,(p)&=&^ab_p^2  r(p^2/k^2 ) [ cut - off2 ] + r(p^2/k^2)&=&((p^2/k^2 ) - 1)^-1 .",
    "note that for a given scale @xmath14 only momentum fluctuations with momenta about @xmath14 can contribute in .",
    "this is precisely due to the insertion of the operator @xmath20 , which is peaked about @xmath13 and ( exponentially ) suppressed elsewhere .",
    "it acts like a mode window. integrating w.r.t .",
    "@xmath14 corresponds to summing - up quantum fluctuations .",
    "the problem of computing the ir physics starting with the short distance behaviour of the theory -_i.e . _  with some uv initial action @xmath21- reduces to the problem of integrating the flow equation @xcite,@xcite .    what have we gained as opposed to the perturbative approach ?",
    "let us consider the propagator @xmath22 obtained from @xmath23 .",
    "decomposing @xmath22 as in , we obtain a set of dimensionless coefficients that depend on the regulator function , momenta , @xmath0 , and the gauge fixing parameter in the following ways : a_1 & = & 1/(1+r)[ak1 ] + a_2 & = & [ 1 + p^2 ( 1+r)]/z + a_3 & = & - s^2/z + a_4 & = & -r / z[ak4 ] + z&=&(1+r ) [ s^2 + ( 1+p^2 ( 1+r))r ] . by construction , @xmath22 has the following limits _ k0p_k , & = & p_[lim1 ] + _ p^20p_k , & = & + [ lim2 ] + _ kp_k,&= & 0 [ lim3 ] they reflect , respectively , the vanishing of the regulator term for @xmath24 , the ir finiteness for @xmath25 , and the non - propagation of fluctuations for large scales .",
    "the important observation is now that even the limit of @xmath22 for @xmath26 remains finite , unlike its divergent perturbative counterpart @xmath5 !",
    "this holds true for an arbitrary choice of @xmath3 and leads to p_k , & = & + + & & - [ prop_np ] .",
    "thus @xmath22 is perfectly well - behaved and finite for all momenta @xmath27 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the spurious divergences are absent as soon as the infra - red behaviour of the propagator is under control .",
    "the delicate question to raise concerns gauge invariance of physical green functions @xcite,@xcite . merely adding the quadratic term ( [ cut - off1 ] ) to the action seems to be in conflict with gauge invariance . in the present context",
    ", the requirement of gauge invariance translates into a _ modified _",
    "ward identity ( mwi ) 0&= & d_^ab(x ) -n_d_^ab(x )   n_a_^b(x ) + & -&g d^dy  f^abc ( + r^cd_k , ) g_k,^db , [ mwik]where the modification stems from the regulator term @xmath28 .",
    "the mwi is compatible with the flow @xcite .",
    "this implies that any functional @xmath29 which is a solution of the mwi at some scale @xmath16 will remain a solution for any @xmath30 , if @xmath31 evolves according to the flow equation . for @xmath32 , reduces to the usual wi .",
    "this establishes that the _ physical _ green functions ( obtained from @xmath31 after integrating - out all momentum fluctuations down to @xmath24 ) do obey the usual wi , _",
    "i.e. _  gauge invariance is maintained .",
    "we shall use the above to show both that the axial gauge is a fixed point under the flow , and that the universal 1-loop @xmath33-function is recovered .",
    "it was shown non - perturbatively that the axial gauge @xmath34 is uniquely defined @xcite .",
    "this serves as the starting point to prove that the axial gauge is a fixed point under the wilsonian flow .",
    "our proof is based on the modified ward identity ( mwi ) , and the finiteness of the flow equation .",
    "no assumptions on the functional form of the full quantum effective action have to be made . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose @xmath3 as momentum independent , in which case the mwi simplifies to 0&=&d_^ab(x ) - n_^x _",
    "n_a^a_(x ) + & & -g d^dy  f^abcr^cd_k , ( x , y ) g_k,^db(y , x ) .",
    "[ mwi ] note that @xmath3 enters the mwi both explicitly and implicitly .",
    "the @xmath3 appearing explicitly corresponds to the choice of @xmath3 at some initial scale @xmath16 , @xmath35 .",
    "an implicit dependence occurs through the dependence of @xmath31 on the scale dependent @xmath36 .",
    "let us choose @xmath37 with @xmath21 solving ( [ mwi ] ) and _ assume _ that @xmath38 for some @xmath30 .",
    "this means in particular that @xmath31 will no longer contain a singular term @xmath39 .",
    "thus the only singular term appearing in the mwi is the term explicitly proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "one can always find an @xmath41 such that @xmath42 does not vanish .",
    "therefore @xmath31 with @xmath38 can not be a solution of ( [ mwi ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "but this is in contradiction with the compatibility of the flow equation and the mwi , which implies that @xmath31 solves the mwi .",
    "it follows that @xmath43 for @xmath37 .",
    "hence the axial gauge is indeed a fixed point of the flow equation .",
    "finally , we summarise the key steps for the computation of the universal 1-loop @xmath33-function within the wilsonian rg approach @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting check for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the flow equation does depend explicitly on the regulator function , while the corresponding 1-loop @xmath33-function -known to be universal- has to be independent of it .",
    "secondly , it is known that the @xmath33-function -within a perturbative computation- receives contributions from the ( regularised ) spurious divergences already at the 1-loop level . in the present approach ,",
    "the theory is finite by construction , and in particular there are no such contributions from spurious divergences .",
    "thus , it is important to see how the universal @xmath33-function is obtained in the present approach .    to that end",
    ", we set @xmath44 and fix the gauge to the axial one , @xmath45 . the running gauge coupling is introduced as @xmath46 . at the 1-loop level ,",
    "the scale dependent wave function renormalisation of the gauge coupling @xmath47 is related to that of the field strength , @xmath48 , through z^2_g , k = z^-1_f , k .",
    "this follows from the mwi @xcite .",
    "we use the ansatz [ ansatz ] _",
    "k= 14d^4x  z_f , k",
    "f_^a f_^a + s_gf[z_f , k^1/2a ] inserting into , we obtain the 1-loop flow for @xmath48 by projecting on the @xmath49-term in the flow equation .",
    "this procedure is self - consistent at the 1-loop level .",
    "the traces involved in can be calculated using heat kernel methods @xcite , with the result [ runz ] _",
    "t z_f , k = g^2 + o(g^4 ) .",
    "the @xmath33-function follows immediately from as _",
    "g^2_t g^2_k = -g_k^4 + o(g_k^6 ) ,  the well - known universal 1-loop result .",
    "we have presented a formulation of qcd based on an exact rg .",
    "this approach is self - consistent , and possible ir divergences are under control . most importantly , gauge invariance of physical green functions is maintained .",
    "the spurious divergences of perturbation theory appear to be naturally absent , which is ultimately a consequence of the ir regulation of the theory . as a result",
    ", the axial gauge turns out to be a fixed point , and the universal 1-loop running of the gauge coupling is recovered .",
    "this formulation is a good starting point for investigations beyond perturbation theory in particular .",
    "typical candidates are theories where the lorentz symmetry is naturally broken , _ e.g. _  qcd at finite temperature , where the rest frame of the heat bath singles out a fixed lorentz vector .",
    "another interesting application concerns a computation of expectation values of wilson loops , which serve as order parameters for confinement .",
    "we hope to report on these matters in the future .",
