    "the quark - lepton symmetry suggests that the lepton mixing matrix should also violate cp invariance .",
    "however , the situation in the lepton sector is very different .",
    "the only evidence for flavor violation in this sector comes from the neutrino oscillations and there is no , so far , any confirmation for cp violation in leptonic decays .",

    "supersymmetry provides a new sources of cp violation through complex couplings in the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the cp asymmetry in the decay mode @xmath8 , in minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm with @xmath2 parity conservation , has been computed in ref .",
    "it was shown that the susy contributions can enhance the cp asymmetry rate in @xmath1-decay by many order of magnitude",

    "the aim of this paper is to show that a significant enhancement for the cp asymmetry of @xmath10 can be obtained in susy models with @xmath2 parity violating terms .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath2 parity violating terms ( in particular , the lepton number violating ones ) induce a tree level contribution to @xmath1-decay .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the @xmath2 parity couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which in general are complex .",
    "we find that this new source of cp violation enhance the asymmetry of @xmath1 decay .",
    "we impose new constraints on the couplings @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the experimental limits , obtained by cleo collaborations@xcite .",

    "section 3 is devoted for analyzing the cp asymmetry of @xmath13 in susy models with @xmath2 parity violation .",
    "we derive the corresponding effective hamiltonian and show that terms that violate @xmath2 parity may give significant contribution to the cp asymmetry in @xmath1-decay .",
