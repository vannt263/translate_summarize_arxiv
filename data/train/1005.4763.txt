    "during the last few years , the ibis instrument @xcite on board the _ integral _ gamma - ray satellite @xcite has played a key role in discovering a previously unrecognized class of high mass x - ray binaries which display a very unusual fast x - ray transient behaviour and host a massive ob supergiant star as companion : the so - called supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ; @xcite ) .",
    "to date approximately 10 show clear characteristics of being a sfxt ( plus the same number of candidates ) , characterized by long periods of low x - ray activity level ( with luminosities or upper limits typically in the range 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) , interspersed with short , strong , flares lasting from a few hours to no more than a few days and reaching peak luminosities of 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "the identification of periodicity in the sfxt outburst behaviour , most likely representing the orbital period , is a key diagnostic for studying the geometry of these systems and hence for understanding the still unknown physical mechanisms behind their very unusual behaviour ( see @xcite for a review ) . because the fast outbursts from sfxts are relatively rare occurrences , the discovery of such periodicities is a very challenging task which has been fulfilled only for an handful of sfxts , mainly through long - term temporal monitoring by _ integral _ ( e.g. ) .",
    "igr j164654507 classification as an sfxt is debatable .",
    "its initial discovery on 6 september 2004 was triggered by the _",
    "integral _ observation in the norma region of a faint @xmath19 mcrab source ( 18 - 60 kev ) which produced a strong @xmath128 mcrab flare on 7 september 2004 before returning to its undetectable pre - flare level @xcite , demonstrating its fast x - ray transient nature .",
    "however since then , no more outburst activity has been reported from the source and its temporal and spectral behaviour above 20kev is largely unknown .",
    "xmm - newton _",
    "observation performed a few days after the source discovery allowed the detection of high intrinsic absorption ( @xmath16@xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 ) as well as a @xmath1228s period which was interpreted as the spin period of a neutron star .",
    "a single bright infrared object falls in the refined _ xmm - newton _",
    "position @xcite , optical and infrared spectroscopy classified it as a supergiant star located at a distance of @xmath12kpc , although different spectral types have been proposed ( o9.5ia by or b0.5i by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported a 2250 kev quiescent flux of @xmath13erg@xmath11s@xmath6 and suggest that igr j164654507 is not a classical sfxt ( for which the dynamical range is @xmath2100 , @xcite ) but a kind of intermediate sfxt still having a dynamic range greater than that of a classical persistent variable supergiant hmxb ( for which the dynamic range is @xmath1420 ) such as vela x-1 . in comparison a very recent paper by @xcite",
    "find no evidence of flaring activity from igr j164654507 and inferred a dynamical range @xmath1410 .    here",
    "we report a comprehensive temporal study of igr j164654507 , based on long term _ integral _",
    "monitoring , which led to the discovery of 9 previously unpublished outbursts as well as the @xmath130 days periodicity found by @xcite , which we interpret as the binary period .",
    "archival ibis data from mjd 52652 to mjd 54764 , giving an on source exposure of @xmath15ms , were processed with the _ integral _ off - line science analysis ( osa ) version 7.0 .",
    "a light curve for igr j164654507 was generated on science window timescales ( @xmath16s ) over the 18 - 60kev energy range ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fulllc ] ) .",
    "the light curve was then searched iteratively for outbursts .",
    "the shortest timescale region of the light curve that produces the highest detection significance greater than 4@xmath17 is found .",
    "this is the brightest outburst in the light curve .",
    "this section of the light curve is then removed from the total light curve and the next highest significant section is searched for .    [ cols=\"<,>,<,^,^,^,>,<,>,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : oldbursts ]    in total 11 outbursts have been found in the light curve ( table  [ table : oldbursts ] ) .",
    "the outbursts range from short flares of 6.8h to periods of flaring activity up to 87 hours . however , many of these outbursts are close together and if considered to be part of an overall period of flaring activity , only 6 periods of flaring remain . by folding the outburst times on different periods ,",
    "an estimation of the duty cycle required over the orbit to explain all the outbursts can be made .",
    "this phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) technique produces a minimum of @xmath123% duty cycle at a period of 29.88 days in our data ( fig .",
    "[ figure : pdm ] ) , which could indicate the orbital period and that outbursts occur over @xmath123% of the orbital phase .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation of the pdm performed by randomising the outburst time used 200,000 times within the length of the outburst provides an error estimate of @xmath00.46d .",
    "this is in aggreement with the recent period found in the _",
    "swift_-bat light curve @xcite .",
    "the science window light curve ( containing 2911 independent data points ) was searched for signs of periodicity using the lomb - scargle periodogram method .",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram is shown in figure  [ figure : ibisper ] with a clear peak evident at a frequency of 0.033 days@xmath6 , corresponding to a period of 30.32 days , agreeing with the value determined by the pdm .",
    "the significance of the peak was confirmed by performing a randomization test @xcite ; the flux points of the light curve are randomly re - ordered and a new lomb - scargle periodogram generated , the distribution of the power of the largest peak is an indicator of the significance of detection . from 200,000 simulations we estimate the 99.9% ,",
    "99.99% and the 99.999% significance levels which are shown in figure  [ figure : ibisper ] ; note that the maximum power achieved in any of the randomized light curves was @xmath1422 .",
    "the error on the identified period was estimated using a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "each flux measurement was adjusted using gaussian statistics within its individual error estimate to generate a simulated light curve of the source .",
    "the corresponding periodogram was produced and the location of the maximum peak near the frequency of 0.033 days@xmath6 was recorded . from 200,000 simulations we estimate the period and its error to be 30.32@xmath00.02 ( 1@xmath17 ) days .",
    "figure  [ figure : explc ] shows the phase folded light curve using a period of 30.32 days and using an ephemeris of mjd 53736.2 to centre the fold at phase 0.0 . assuming any enhancement to the emission to coincide with the neutron stars closest approach to the donor",
    ", we consider phase 0.0 to be periastron .",
    "to see the effect of the outbursts on the phase folded curve a new fold was performed excluding all of the outbursts from table  [ table : oldbursts ] .",
    "this second phase folded light curve is shown in figure  [ figure : lcburst ] , and shows no substantial difference in shape , demonstrating that there is an underlying periodicity in the flux aside from the outbursts when the entire light curve is considered .",
    "the public light curves for igr j164654507 from the _",
    "swift_-bat mission were also analyzed using the lomb - scargle periodogram with the same tests used on the _ integral _ light curve to see if there was any indication of the 30.32 day periodicity .",
    "the _ swift _ orbit light curve showed a period of 30.23@xmath00.04d with a power of 22.43 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : swiftper ] ) , compatible with the period found in the _ integral _ light curve .",
    "there is some evidence for an eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ figure : explc ] ) in the phase folded _",
    "integral _ light curve .",
    "however , this can not be completely disentangled from low exposure in the relevant phase bins and the statistical significance of this dip is low .",
    "the feature is also not apparent in the _ swift _ phase folded light curve leading to the conclusion that this is an exposure artifact and not a real feature .",
    "the two outbursts with the highest significance in table  [ table : oldbursts ] ( 2 and 3 ) are shown in the inset of figure  [ figure : fulllc ] .",
    "such ibis data have been unsuccessfully searched for pulsations .",
    "the brightest flares can not be seen by _ jem - x _ either on science window timescales or in deep mosaics in the 4 - 20kev energy range , where the science windows exposure of 2.8ks was not sufficiently long to detect the source .",
    "this results in an upper limit for the flux during the outburst of 8@xmath18erg@xmath19s@xmath6 . only one _ swift_-xrt observation is available with only 69 events in 2ks and so it has not been possible to extract a meaningful spectrum and to search for pulsations .",
    "however this does give an estimated 0.2 - 10 kev absorbed ( unabsorbed ) flux of 9.1@xmath18erg@xmath11s@xmath6 ( 4.9@xmath20erg@xmath11s@xmath6 ) , based on a power law index of 1.0 , a galactic n@xmath21 2.12@xmath910@xmath22 and an intrinsic n@xmath21 6@xmath910@xmath10 .",
    "the flux has also been measured by _ xmm - newton _ as 3@xmath01@xmath18erg@xmath19s@xmath6 in the 4 - 10kev energy range @xcite and as @xmath23erg@xmath19s@xmath6 in the 0.2 - 10kev energy range using _",
    "suzaku_-xis @xcite .",
    "these measurements approximately follow the drop in flux in the phase folded light curve ( fig .",
    "[ figure : lcburst ] ) .",
    "spectra for the two outbursts with the highest significance detection ( n. 2 and 3 in table 1 ) have been extracted from the ibis data .",
    "the 1860 kev spectrum of the discovery outburst ( n.3 ) is reasonably fit by a bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath24=0.6 , 15 d.o.f .",
    ", kt=18.6@xmath25 kev , flux equal to 1.2@xmath26erg@xmath11s@xmath6 ) or alternatively by a power law ( @xmath24=0.7 , 15 d.o.f , @xmath27 = 3.0@xmath00.3 ) .",
    "similarly , the newly discovered outburst ( n.2 ) is also reasonably fit by a bremsstrahlung ( @xmath24=1.2 , 15 d.o.f . , kt=29@xmath28 kev , flux equal to 9.5@xmath20erg@xmath11s@xmath6 ) or by a power law ( @xmath24=1.24 , 15 d.o.f.,@xmath27 = 2.5@xmath00.3 ) .",
    "it is evident that both outbursts have a similar soft spectrum and a comparable average flux of activity , furthermore the reported spectral shapes are very similar to those seen during outburst activity of other sfxts ( e.g. ) .",
    "taking into account the 1860kev bremsstrahlung spectral shape of both previous outbursts , we extrapolated their 0.210kev soft x - ray flux obtaining a value of @xmath13@xmath26erg@xmath11s@xmath6 . to date the lowest and highest measured unabsorbed soft x - ray fluxes",
    "are equal to @xmath13.6@xmath18erg@xmath11s@xmath6 @xcite and @xmath14.9@xmath20erg@xmath11s@xmath6 ( this paper ) so the source displays a dynamical range from 6 to 83 . as for the hard x - ray band , if we compare the 2250 kev quiescent flux ( @xmath1 @xmath13erg@xmath11s@xmath6 , @xcite ) to the outbursts fluxes as listed in table 1 , then the dynamical range is from 27 to 82 .",
    "we note that such values are significantly higher than that recently reported ( @xmath1410 ) by @xcite as based on 54 months bat monitoring ( 1550 kev ) during which no evidence for flaring activity was found .",
    "however , we point out that such apparent dynamical range incongruences can be explained by the different bat and ibis instrumental capabilities .",
    "ibis is particularly suited to detect short outbursts and so to reveal the dynamic range of fast x - ray transient sources , such as igr j164654507 , thanks to its higher instantaneous sensitivity for shorter observation lengths ( i.e. science windows , @xmath1 2000 s duration ) which match very well the duration of the flares .",
    "bat is more suited to long - term monitoring thanks to its more continuous coverage but could eventually miss the detection of short flares which , if close to the ibis sensitivity , are very likely not detectable by bat due to its poorer instantaneous sensitivity .",
    "it is worth noting that ibis and bat show to be complementary and their combination is important in investigating the properties of sfxts .    in order to test the recurrence of emission at periastron we carry out a recurrence analysis @xcite . for this test",
    "we calculate the light curve significance for a region of 4 days either side of the points considered as periastron and apastron ( approximately 25% of the orbit ) .",
    "this will highlight if we see a low level emission at periastron passages compared to apastron .",
    "comparing the distributions of significances for apastron and periastron using a kolmogorov - smirnov test we find a probability of 74% that they have been drawn from different distributions .",
    "the orbital characteristics and stellar properties for igr j164654507 are very similar to those of sax j1818.61703 .",
    "the peak flux from the phase folded light curve with the outburst removed of sax j1818.61703 as determined by @xcite is @xmath12.2cs@xmath6 in the isgri 18 - 60kev band .",
    "comparing this to the peak flux of @xmath10.55cs@xmath6 from the same light curve for igr j164654507 shows that igr j164654507 is @xmath14 times weaker if we assume that these systems are very similar .",
    "the difference in flux is compatible with the known distance measurements for both sources .",
    "however , sax j1818.61703 shows much less absorption with @xmath29@xmath11 compared to @xmath30@xmath11 for igr j164654507 .    since masses and periods are known from the spectral type @xcite and assuming that the compact object is a neutron star of mass 1.4@xmath31 , kepler s third law gives the semi - major axis for the system of 121.9 - 126.3@xmath32 . as we see no evidence for roche - lobe overflow in the system the eccentricity of the system must be @xmath140.8 for the smallest possible donor star size and @xmath140.6 for the largest donor star size of 26@xmath32 .",
    "it is important to point out that whereas classical sfxts have a remarkable dynamical range ( @xmath2100 ) , we found for igrj164654507 significantly lower values ( in the range @xmath130 - 80 ) .",
    "although in this regard igr j164654507 can not be considered a classical sfxt , still its dynamical range deserves some attention since it is greater than that of classical persistent variable supergiant hmxbs ( @xmath1420 ) .",
    "our findings on the source temporal behaviour and its dinamical range are in agreement with the results reported by walter & zurita heras ( 2007 ) and strongly support their idea that igrj164654507 is an intermediate sfxt system , much like few other similar cases reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "as this system has both the orbital period and spin period known then it may be plotted on the corbet diagram ( fig .",
    "[ figure : corbet ] ) .",
    "this system resides between the regions dominated by wind accreting systems and be x - ray transient systems , much like igr j184830311 and sax j1818.61703 .",
    "when looked at in the context of the other sfxts , igr j164654507 sits in the middle of the class .",
    "this implies a longer orbit than typical wind accreting supergiant systems , but without evidence for accretion from a circumstellar disk , as in be x - ray binaries .",
    "our measurement of the orbital period in this system , combined with bursting behaviour of the source and constraints on the eccentricity of the orbits support the picture of accretion from a clumpy wind @xcite .",
    "the underlying modulation in the phase folded light curve can be explained by the eccentricity of the system as with igr j175442619 @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ figure : lcburst ] , an underlying periodic emission , around periastron , does appear to be present in the phase folded light curve even when bright outbursts have been subtracted .",
    "igr j164654507 has been shown to exhibit an @xmath130 day periodicity in both the _ integral_-ibis and _ swift_-bat light curves .",
    "this period is attributed to the orbital period of the system and corresponds to a semi - major axis of 121.9 - 126.3@xmath32 .",
    "this system is remarkably similar to sax j1818.61703 , except that igr j164654507 is known to be further away , helping explain the lack of underlying emission that can only be seen in the phase - folded light curve of the entire _ integral _ data set and not in the recurrence analysis",
    ". a low dynamic range is observed , which is higher than that of a typical supergiant hmxb .",
    "this would suggest that igr j164654507 is an intermediate sfxt and that these may form a continuum ranging from typical supergiant hmxbs to the extreme sfxts .",
