    "note that the first group of parameters refers to the pomeron and has been chosen over together taken @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "the interesting fact is that the matter distribution can not be parameterized by one gaussian packet ( see also @xcite ) .    as mentioned in the introduction we neglect the contribution of the negative signature reggons that leads to the difference in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering especially around the dip .",
