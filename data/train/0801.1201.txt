    "the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain is probably the first and most studied example of a strongly correlated quantum system .",
    "the first foundations towards exact solutions date back to the early days of quantum mechanics @xcite and large scale numerical simulations were already performed in the early sixties @xcite . due to the interesting behaviour of this simple model and the connection with many low - dimensional antiferromagnetic materials ,",
    "the spin-1/2 chain is still heavily studied today .",
    "some of the most fundamental properties , such as the exact amplitude of the power - law correlation functions @xcite and the full temperature behaviour of the susceptibility @xcite , have only been established after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity has lead to renewed interest in low - dimensional antiferromagnetism .",
    "more recently , corrections from impurities and boundaries have come into focus @xcite , which will also be the topic of this paper .",
    "boundary thermodynamics are especially relevant for experiments @xcite since even the most carefully prepared samples contain imperfections which effectively cut the chains , and corrections to the thermodynamic limit become especially large at low temperatures . in order to analyse the pure and the impurity contributions it is useful to define the finite size corrections @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the total free energy ( susceptibility ) of a system with @xmath1 sites and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the free energy ( susceptibility ) per site of an infinite pure system . in the limit of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 become @xmath1-independent thermodynamic boundary contributions , which will be denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 and discussed in detail later on . however",
    ", in general @xmath1 will also take on small values in experimental systems according to a random distribution .",
    "it is well understood that finite chains with an odd number of sites @xmath1 have doublet ground states , which leads to a diverging curie susceptibility at temperatures below the first excitation energy @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been established that the boundary susceptibility @xmath21 is also divergent in the limit @xmath22 , albeit with a curie factor which has a logarithmic temperature dependence @xcite . for experimental systems",
    "it is desirable to know the complete crossover between the two limits , which has to be averaged according to a random distribution .",
    "if the impurity concentration is @xmath23 and we assume a poisson distribution , i.e. , that the impurity positions are uncorrelated , then the average susceptibility becomes @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and we have assumed that each impurity effectively removes one site . the typical approximation in experimental papers to estimate the impurity concentration by the low - temperature curie tail corresponds to setting @xmath26 ( assuming that each chain segment with odd length acts effectively like a free spin-@xmath5 ) .",
    "this , however , does not capture the full complexity of the problem and might , in particular , lead to an underestimate of the impurity concentration by an order of magnitude .",

    "the analysis of the susceptibility even in the undoped system has been hampered by large curie - like contributions at low temperatures making a detailed test of the theoretical predictions for the susceptibility of the pure system @xcite difficult .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that these contributions can be largely suppressed by annealing the samples .",
    "it therefore has been suggested that the curie - like contribution is caused by excess oxygen .",
    "each excess oxygen atom would then dope two holes into the chain .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis of the susceptibility data @xcite has shown that it seems to be possible to consistently describe the data by assuming that these holes are basically immobile and therefore effectively cut the chain into finite segments . a more detailed understanding of these experiments is desirable because it might also shed some light on the general issue of oxygen doping in cuprates , and in particular , in the high - temperature superconductors .",
