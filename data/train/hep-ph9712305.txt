    "in contrast , while there is indeed considerable cancellation amongst the various chargino contributions , there is nonetheless a sizeable residue that remains .",
    "we may understand the large cancellations among the gluino contributions in analogy with the familiar gim cancellation in the sm : indeed such a cancellation would be exact if squarks were precisely degenerate ( _ i.e. _ , the squark mass matrix is proportional to the unit matrix ) because we can then , by a unitary transformation , align the squark and quark mass matrices , so that the gluino - squark - quark vertex is exactly flavour diagonal . within the msugra framework with universal soft breaking squark mass matrices at the unification scale ,",
    "squarks are indeed ( approximately ) degenerate , and gluino loop contributions to the flavour violating @xmath59 decay are suppressed . the gim - like cancellation that we have described above",
    "does not occur when yukawa couplings enter the calculation as occurs , for instance , via the higgsino components of chargino and neutralino loops .",
    "in this case , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ nfig1 ] , the cancellation is indeed incomplete ( particularly for the chargino where the large top quark yukawa coupling enters ) .",

    "by allowing soft - breaking mass squared matrices with arbitrary off - diagonal entries , it should be possible to get very large flavour violating gluino interactions .",
    "the issue that we address , however is whether large gluino contributions are possible even if we choose these soft squark matrices to be diagonal at the unification scale .",
    "as we will soon see , the physics of this ansatz is basis - dependent .    to parametrize the breaking of the squark degeneracy we begin by noting that we may always choose a quark basis so that _ either _ the down or the up type yukawa couplings are diagonal at the weak scale .",
    "we will call these the @xmath102- and @xmath167- cases , respectively .",
    "next , these couplings are evolved to @xmath17 , where both up and down yukawa matrices have off - diagonal components . in the @xmath102-case , the down type yukawa matrices",

    "this is , however , no longer the case if we further assume that the soft breaking squark mass squared matrix is diagonal ( but not a multiple of the identity ) at the gut scale .",
    "this is because the transformation that takes us from the @xmath102-case to the @xmath167-case does not leave the squark mass squared matrix diagonal ( except in the case when this matrix is @xmath168 ) .",

    "the results of our calculation of the gluino contribution to @xmath77 where the squark degeneracy is broken as described above is shown in fig .",
    "[ nfig6 ] for the @xmath102-case labelled @xmath102-diagonal , and for the @xmath167-case , labelled @xmath167-diagonal . in each frame",
    ", we have three curves labelled @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 for the cases where just left , just right , and both left and right sbottom soft masses are different from @xmath13 . in our calculation , we have chosen @xmath178  gev , @xmath128  gev , @xmath179 , @xmath104 and @xmath180 .",
    "we choose a large value of @xmath13 so that the squark masses are not dominated by @xmath181 ( in which case splitting due to non - universal soft mass term would be unimportant ) .",
    "also , for the large value of @xmath0 the bottom yukawa coupling is significant .",
    "the following features are worth noting .    * for @xmath172",
    "the value of @xmath182 is the same for the up and down cases for reasons that we have already explained . * for non - degenerate squarks ,",
    "gluino loop effects are significantly larger in the @xmath167-case .",
    "this may be understood if we recall that in the @xmath102-case , the mixing of down type yukawas at @xmath17 arises _ only _ due to rge .",
    "* non - degeneracy effects when just the right squarks are split show only small variation with the non - degeneracy parameter @xmath183 because flavour mixing in the right squark sector is suppressed . *",
    "somewhat surprising is the fact that despite the large degree of non - degeneracy , the gluino contribution to @xmath77 , which increases by up to an order of magnitude relative to that in the msugra case , never becomes really large . for our choice of parameters",
    ", this may be partly due to the fact that gluinos and squarks are significantly heavier than @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "this is not the complete reason though . in our computation",
    "we find that the three main contributions ( from the two sbottoms and the @xmath186 ) cancel one another leaving a remainder that is typically smaller than 10 - 15% of the largest contribution . while this cancellation is much less complete than in the msugra case , we are unable to give a simple argument for why such a cancellation occurs .    finally , we comment on the neutralino contributions for the case of non - degenerate squarks .",
    "we have already noted that cancellations among various chargino contributions are incomplete because of the effect of large higgsino couplings to the @xmath187 system .",
    "for large values of @xmath0 , we may expect a similar effect for neutralinos .",
    "we may further guess that this effect is largest in the @xmath167-case where flavor mixing does not originate solely in the rge .",
    "we have checked that for values of parameters in fig .",
    "[ nfig6 ] above a small value of @xmath188 , the neutralino contribution to @xmath77 is indeed enhanced by a factor of 6 - 7 above its msugra value , and further , that this enhancement is largely due to incompleteness in the cancellation between various contributions .",
    "for very large values of @xmath183 , @xmath77 is about 1.5 times its msugra value , but opposite in sign .",
    "we thus conclude that while the neutralino contribution is somewhat sensitive to the splitting of squark masses , it never appears to become very dominant .    to summarize the results of this section",
    ", we see that with our assumptions , gluino contributions to the amplitude for the @xmath189 decay never dominate the susy contribution .",
    "this contribution may nonetheless be non - negligible even if gluinos and squarks are well beyond the reach of the tevatron ( and its proposed upgrades ) as seen in fig .",
    "[ nfig6 ] .",
    "we emphasize though that our conclusion is special to models where all the flavour violation in the gluino - squark - quark vertex at the gut scale comes from non - diagonal yukawa interactions .",
    "larger contributions from gluino loops may be possible in other models .",
