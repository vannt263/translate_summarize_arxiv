    "a small fraction of red giant stars have lithium abundances ( @xmath3(li ) ) exceeding the predictions of standard evolution models even though the majority of red giants ( rgs ) exhibit @xmath3(li )  orders of magnitude below standard model predictions @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath3(li )  demonstrates that non - convective mixing processes contribute significantly to li depletion , which makes the li - rich stars appear even more unusual .",
    "the most li - rich rgs have abundances exceeding the meteoritic abundances ( @xcite , @xcite , ) and require a nucleosynthetic origin for the li .",
    "@xcite described a pathway for li nucleosynthesis through the reactions @xmath6he(@xmath7,@xmath8)@xmath9be and @xmath9be(@xmath10,@xmath11)@xmath9li .",
    "this process requires high temperatures ( @xmath12  k ) for the first reaction to occur and fast mixing ( such as convection ) to transport the by - products to a cool region of the star ( @xmath13  k ) for lithium to be long - lived .",
    "these conditions are met at the base of the convection zones in luminous asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . however , understanding li - rich stars(li )  meets or exceeds the commonly used threshold of 1.5  dex . ] found along the red giant branch ( rgb ) presents a problem because these stars convection zones are too cool to synthesize @xmath9be .",
    "thus , the @xmath6he reaction must occur below the convection zone , and a fast non - convective mixing mechanism is required to connect the convection zone to the deeper layers of the star in order to explain the enriched surface abundances .    through a series of observations and advances in evolution modeling ( e.g. , , @xcite , @xcite ) , it has become largely accepted that red giants evolving through the luminosity bump stage of evolution likely experience a short - lived phase of enriched li .",
    "a number of deep mixing mechanisms for this stage of evolution have been proposed , including thermohaline mixing , magnetic buoyancy @xcite , and the hybrid magneto - thermohaline mixing @xcite . however , as the number of the relatively rare li - rich stars continues to grow , it has become clear that they are not restricted to just the luminosity bump and agb , but instead are found along the rgb .",
    "a new short - lived phase of li - richness was hypothesized by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter k11 ) , who suggested that li might be regenerated during the he - flash .",
    "this mechanism would account for the population of li - rich red giants with temperatures too warm to be luminosity bump stars and that fall in a narrow luminosity range that coincides with the red clump ( rc ) .",
    "this he - flash phenomenon would be relevant for stars in a narrow mass range of @xmath141.52.25  @xmath0  , the upper limit being defined by the maximum mass that experiences a he flash , and the lower limit by the stars that maintain a relatively large reservoir of @xmath6he . for the upper bound , showed that the transition occurs closer to 1.81.9  @xmath0 .",
    "at least one li - rich star is known to be in this mass range and is confirmed to be a he - burning star via asteroseismology @xcite .    as a test of the hypothesis suggested by , we observed rc stars in four open clusters with ages and metallicities that place their rc stars in the mass range specified by . in three of the four clusters",
    ", we also observed rgs at other evolutionary stages to constrain the pre - he flash abundances .",
    "in addition to @xmath3(li ) , we also measure @xmath1c/@xmath2c .",
    "many of the li - rich field stars in have @xmath1c/@xmath2c  that is much lower than predicted from standard evolution models , presumably a consequence of the same mixing that brought the synthesized li into the convection zone .",
    "although newly synthesized li can be destroyed if exposed to high enough temperatures , the altered @xmath1c/@xmath2c  will persist as evidence of the past deep mixing .",
    "the selection and observation of the stars in this study are described in sections [ sec : clusters ] and [ sec : obs ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we outline the measurement of li abundances and @xmath1c/@xmath2c . in section [ sec : discuss ] , we present the significance of our results , and we give our conclusions in section [ sec : end ] .",

    "table  [ tab : clusters ] lists the adopted cluster parameters ( age , dereddened distance modulus , reddening , and metallicity ) that were used to select the four clusters for study .",
    "we used @xcite isochrones to estimate the initial masses of the stars currently at the rc stage in each cluster , and our sample spans 1.62.2  @xmath0 . because of uncertainties in the cluster parameters , some of the true masses may fall outside of the narrow mass range we wish to probe .",

    "@xmath3(li )  were measured by fitting spectra synthesized with moog to the observed data between 6706.7 and 6708.4    using the line list from @xcite .",

    "telluric features are abundant in this part of the spectrum . in most cases the telluric lines are weak , and we account for their presence by adding in their contribution using the @xcite atlas telluric spectrum , broadened to our instrumental resolution and scaled to fit the depth of the features .",

    "the @xmath2cn feature was not recoverable .",
    "for the ngc  2204 stars where the feature was recovered , it should be noted that the telluric feature was always stronger that the underlying stellar feature , and uncertainties in the telluric division may be large .",
    "therefore , all of the @xmath1c/@xmath2c  measurements for ngc  2204 should be used with caution .",
    "the results of the @xmath1c/@xmath2c  analysis are given in table  [ tab : stell_abun ] , which includes a quality parameter .",
    "stars with measurements have a quality parameter ranging from ` a ' through ` d , ' which corresponds to decreasing quality of the fits . those with quality of `",

    "this interpretation is also borne out in collinder  110 and ngc  2204 , where it is clear from figure  [ fig : cmds2 ] that the highest li stars ( filled symbols ) are the ones that appear to be first ascent rgb stars and not rc stars .    however , because rc should be more common than first ascent rgs , one would expect all of the clusters to have more low @xmath3(li )  stars than high @xmath3(li )  stars .",

    "a few outliers are worth noting .",
    "first , in ngc  6583 the most luminous star has @xmath3(li )  comparable to the other rgb star , whereas the most luminous star in ngc  2204 has severely depleted levels .",
    "this implies that the ngc  2204 luminous star is on the agb , not the rgb .",
    "in all of the clusters except ngc  2506 , there are one or more candidate rc stars with @xmath3(li )  more similar to the rgb star levels .",
    "rc stars are plotted as red circles in figures  [ fig : cmds ] ( which was used to determine their rc candidacy ) and [ fig : cmds2 ] .",
    "we find that all but one of the candidate rc stars with high li are closer matches to the first ascent rgb in figure  [ fig : cmds2 ] and were reclassified based on those positions .",
    "the exception is ngc  6583  72 , whose classification is ambiguous in figure  [ fig : cmds2 ] .",

    "four stars , on the other hand , are still outliers .",
    "all of the stars are in the clusters that had the difficult telluric removal , so it is possible that the low @xmath1c/@xmath2c  measurements are spurious . however ,",
    "our confidence in the validity of the measurements are due to the facts that ( 1 ) the @xmath2cn feature is stronger ( more easily detectable ) for low @xmath1c/@xmath2c , and ( 2 ) owing to the blend of lines creating the @xmath2cn feature , the width of the line would be difficult to mimic with residuals from the telluric removal .",
    "this sample of stars was selected specifically to test the hypothesis that li is generated at the he flash . in the sample ,",
    "all of the li - rich stars that have @xmath1c/@xmath2c  available have @xmath3(li)@xmath212  dex .",
    "this minimum @xmath3(li )  in the sample is influenced by two factors .",
    "first , the newly discovered rgs in were pre - screened for the presence of the li line in low resolution spectra , leading to a temperature - dependent minimum @xmath3(li ) .",
    "second , the lowest @xmath3(li )  stars in both the new rg and literature rg samples in do not have @xmath1c/@xmath2c  measurements",
    ". none of our stars have li abundances at this level , implying a low occurrence rate for li - rich stars .",
    "using the binomial statistics in @xcite , we can estimate the @xmath213 upper bound for the occurrence rate of rc clump stars more li - rich than @xmath214  dex to be @xmath215% .",
    "this result is the same if we use all 38 photometrically identified rc candidates or if we reduce the sample size to 35 to account for the ones that may be rgb stars .",
    "the lack of a li - rich star in our sample is still consistent with the field giant study , which estimated the incidence to be around 1% .",
    "if we factor @xmath1c/@xmath2c  into our consideration , we can perform a more stringent test of the fraction of stars that go through a li - enriched phase early in the core he - burning stage . in figure",
    "[ fig : cratio_hist ] , we show the @xmath1c/@xmath2c  distribution of the subset of the sample that overlaps our rc sample in parameter space . we remove stars from the paper that have @xmath216 and @xmath47@xmath217  k. the first cut removes four luminous rgs in that are outside of the mass range and",
    "are near the second dredge - up phase on the early - agb ( see ) .",
    "the second cut removes cooler rgs that are more likely to be at the luminosity bump .",
    "overlaid in figure  [ fig : cratio_hist ] is the @xmath1c/@xmath2c  distribution of our sample of 38 rc candidates .",
    "the distributions are very different .",
    "the majority of the li - rich stars have @xmath1c/@xmath2c@xmath218 .",
    "such a low @xmath1c/@xmath2c  is a signature of deep mixing that dredges up material from the vicinity of the h - burning shell , where @xmath1c/@xmath2c  is 3.5 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the mechanism responsible for the enhanced li requires ( or is accompanied by ) very deep mixing . because @xmath1c/@xmath2c  of the stellar atmosphere can only be lowered by mixing , this signature of low @xmath1c/@xmath2c  will persist even when the lithium levels return to normal low values .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1c/@xmath2c  distribution of our rc sample is inconsistent with the hypothesis that most / all stars of 1.52.2  @xmath0  experience a brief li - rich stage .",
    "instead , the li - rich stage must only be experienced by a small fraction of stars .",
    "we can identify the subset of stars in our sample that likely went through a li - rich phase as the outlier group of low @xmath1c/@xmath2c   stars we identified in figure  [ fig : li_results ] . if the four stars that are clear outliers ( i.e. , no limit on either abundance measurement ) are the only true outliers , then only @xmath219 of the rc stars went through a li - rich phase . the fraction is larger",

    "the rc sample for these two calculations only use the rc candidates without strong evidence for reclassification ( i.e. , the ` reclassified ' rc candidates in collinder  110 and ngc  2204 are removed ) and only considers stars with @xmath1c/@xmath2c  measurements .",

    "[ fig : cratio_hist],scaledwidth=50.0% ]      our interpretations may also be affected by the unknown rotational histories of the individual stars .",

    ", @xcite showed that the red giant descendants of these stars are still almost uniformly slow rotators , a result that is reproduced here ( section [ sec : rot ] ) .",
    "this fact makes it difficult to discern which stars were faster or slower ms rotators .",
    "the initial ms rotation affects the depth of mixing and thus the observed surface @xmath3(li )  of rgs .",
    "furthermore , rotation extends the main sequence lifetime . in an effort to explain the extended ms turn - offs of clusters in the magellanic clouds",
    ", @xcite explored the differences of isochrone morphology of models including large initial rotation compared to non - rotating models .",
    "they found that the isochrones made with fast rotating models were nearly indistinguishable from the slow rotating models .",
    "the implication to this work is that some of the rgs may be both more massive than we expect and may have experienced extensive rotational mixing .",
    "these stars would be difficult to distinguish from the stars that conform to the non - rotating model assumptions .    among intermediate age milky way open clusters , some show extended rc morphologies that are inconsistent with simple single stellar population models .",
    "some of this extension is due to the fact that the ages of these clusters are such that the rc stars span the mass range that delineates the transition from quiescent to he flash core burning , resulting in a primary and secondary rc @xcite .",
    "however , this can not explain all of the spread in the msto , nor can it be explained with an age spread .",
    "the authors note that variations in the mass loss rate on the rgb or in the core overshoot efficiencies on the ms ( which affects the mass transition for the different types of he core burning onset ) could be responsible .",
    "if these factors are at play in the clusters of this work , they may also influence the variation of @xmath3(li )  observed in our clusters .",
    "we have measured @xmath3(li )  and @xmath1c/@xmath2c  in a sample of rgs in four southern open clusters .",
    "most of the stars are rc stars having masses between 1.6 and 2.2  @xmath0 , which were selected to test the hypothesis that stars in this mass range synthesize li during the he flash and spend a short fraction of their rc lifetimes as li - rich stars .",
    "we find seven stars with @xmath3(li )  near the threshold of li - richness at 1.5  dex .",
    "three of these stars are rgb stars , and all of the four that were identified as candidate rc stars on cmds are or could be consistent with the rgb on spectroscopic @xmath47@xmath223 diagrams .    given the modest sample size , the absence of li - rich stars in the rc constrains the occurrence ( or fractional lifetime ) to @xmath215% , which is compatible with the 1% lifetime quoted by .",
    "however , the majority of the li - rich rc field giants in have low @xmath1c/@xmath2c , the result of deep mixing which dredges - up material with @xmath1c/@xmath2c  near 3.5 .",
    "even if the freshly synthesized li is destroyed during the rc lifetime , the evidence of the past deep mixing ( i.e. , low @xmath1c/@xmath2c ) should remain .",
    "the rc sample in this study has a @xmath1c/@xmath2c  distribution that is much higher , demonstrating that these stars experienced less mixing .",
    "we therefore conclude that if a li - enrichment episode occurs at the he flash , it must only affect a fraction of the stars evolving through that phase . from a set of outliers in the @xmath3(li)@xmath1c/@xmath2c  distribution",
