    "it has been known for many years that the inner regions of spiral galaxies are fundamentally different from their outer parts .",
    "the inner parts are generally rounder , redder , and show a higher fraction of random vs. ordered motion .",
    "images of spirals show that less star formation is present in the central regions .",
    "radial surface brightness profiles can be fitted well by a large exponential disk and a central , steeper component ( e.g. , kent 1984 ) .",
    "when looking at the stellar kinematics , one finds that v/@xmath6 in the inner parts is much lower than in the outer parts , where the rotation velocity is high and the stellar dispersion low ( e.g. , noordermeer 2006 ) . as a result , people traditionally viewed spiral galaxies as a combination of a flattened disk and a spheroidal central component called ` bulge ' , which are assumed to be physically and dynamically different : in this picture , the disk component is rotationally supported against gravity , and the bulge is a hotter system , similar to an elliptical galaxy . to understand how spiral galaxies are built ,",
    "one generally does a bulge - disk decomposition and studies the parameters of both components .",
    "if one wants to go into more details , one can go one step further , and also study possible components such as bars , spiral arms , rings , and inner disks ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and erwin & sparke 2002 ) .",
    "when doing the bulge - disk decomposition , it is imperative that the decomposition is well - defined .",
    "the bulge - disk decomposition can be based e.g. on the surface brighteness profile ( photometric decomposition ) , the stellar kinematics ( kinematic decomposition ) or on the two - dimensional axis ratio ( morphological definition ) ( see peletier 2008 ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of the resulting parameters then depends strongly on the definition . up to",
    "now most b / d decompositions have used the photometric decomposition , using a one - dimensional azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile .",
    "such profiles can generally be fitted well by an exponential disk and a central srsic r@xmath7 distribution ( andredakis , peletier & balcells 1995 , graham 2001 ) .",
    "the srsic index @xmath4 has been found to correlate with the morphological type of the galaxy , and generally ranges between 1 and 4 . for a comprehensive review about the srsic index see graham & driver ( 2005 ) . in recent years",
    "it has been discovered that the bulges with surface brightness profiles that are close to exponential ( i.e. srsic index close to 1 ) are different from bulges with larger srsic indices , which resemble more elliptical galaxies .",
    "bulges with exponential profiles appear to contain more dust , show more recent star formation , are more flattened and more rotationally supported ( kormendy 1992 , kormendy & kennicutt 2004 , fisher & drory 2008 ) .",
    "these objects are called pseudo - bulges , but one might also call them central disks . for more detailed examples and references we refer the reader to the comprehensive review by kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) , which presents a complete summary of observational evidence for this kind of bulge and their formation via secular evolution : bulges could result from the evolution of disk dynamical instabilities .",
    "numerical simulations seem in fact to suggest that the dissolution of bars inside the disks may trigger the formation of three - dimensional stellar structures with roughly exponential profiles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , norman , sellwood , hasan 1996 ) . it is also known that these processes are more effective in late - type galaxies rather than in early - types , despite the fact that there are examples of pseudobulges in sa and even s0 galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper , we will also adopt the photometric bulge - disk decomposition .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate the nature and interconnection of disks and bulges in a class of rather poorly studied objects : late - type spiral galaxies , full of dust and star forming regions , and characterised by relatively low - surface brightness ; in the last years , galaxies towards the end of the hubble sequence have been the target for a number of hst - based imaging surveys ( @xcite , @xcite , carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) which revealed the presence of a variety of structures in their inner regions : bulges , nuclear star clusters , stellar disks , small bars , double bars , star forming rings , whose formation and evolutionary patterns are not properly understood yet .",
    "because of the extinction , a photometric analysis based on near - infrared data gives more reliable results ( @xmath8 is roughly a factor 8 lower than @xmath9 : rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "another advantage of working in the nir is that the nir light is much less affected by recent episodes of star formation than optical light , and traces the old stellar populations hosting most of the luminous mass of galaxies . for the analysis of hst - nicmos data",
    "the problem is , however , that the field of view is very small ( about 20@xmath10 @xmath11 20@xmath10 for nic2 , so that an accurate determination of the sky background is very difficult .",
    "here we use data from the 2mass survey to solve this problem .",
    "the sample that we study here is special , in that accurate stellar kinematic maps , stellar absorption line maps of a few strong lines , as well as emission line strengths of [ oiii ] and h@xmath12 have been determined , making it possible for us to study the relation between structural parameters and stellar populations , the behaviour of ionized gas and the stellar potential .",
    "these maps come from sauron ( bacon et al .",
    "2001 ) integral field spectroscopy .",
    "the stellar and gas kinematics has been published in ganda et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , while the absorption line maps have been analyzed in ganda et al .",
    "our sample of late - type galaxies can be easily compared to the early - type spirals of the sauron survey ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "2002 ) , presented in falcn - barroso et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and peletier et al .",
    "the fact that kinematic parameters are available for this sample makes it possible to study the position of late - type spirals on the m@xmath13 - @xmath6 relations , establishing in this way whether these bulges are similar in structure and formation to bulges of early - type spirals .",
    "given the renewed interest in the extinction in spiral galaxies ( driver et al .",
    "2007 , graham & worley 2008 , hereinafter gw ) we decided to use the unique property of this sample that the amount of extinction can be calculated by combining absorption line maps , which are basically independent of extinction , with broad band colour maps , such as the mg  b maps , which are affected by it . to do this",
    ", we determined high resolution @xmath2 maps for the 10 galaxies for which hst - f606w ( @xmath0 ) images were available , in addition to f160w ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the combination of colour and line strength gives the colour excess e@xmath14 in a model - independent way , which can easily be converted to a@xmath3 .",
    "this method is in principle very powerful , but has not been applied much in the literature , because of the lack of well - calibrated line strength data .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ samplesecch4 ] describes the sample selection ; section [ profilesch4 ] the photometric profiles and the methods applied for their extraction ; section [ bulgediscdecch4 ] the actual bulge - disk decomposition ; section [ coloursecch4 ] compares the photometry in the nir with the optical @xmath15 band , and presents extinction maps ; section [ correlationsecch44 ] investigates the correlations between the structural parameters and other galaxy properties ; section [ centralcompsecch4 ] addresses the frequent presence of inner additional components , and , finally , section [ conclusionsecch4 ] summarizes the main results .",
    "the sample of galaxies on which we perform our bulge - disk decomposition is the same for which we presented the two - dimensional kinematical maps from sauron integral - field spectroscopy in the paper by @xcite and the line - strengths maps in the paper by @xcite .",
    "+ the galaxies were optically selected ( @xmath16 @xmath17 12.5 , according to the values given in @xcite , hereafter rc3 ) with hst imaging available from wfpc2 and/or nicmos .",
    "their morphological type ranges between sb and sd , following the classification given in ned ( from the rc3 ) .",
    "galaxies in close interaction and seyferts were discarded .",
    "the resulting sample contains 18 nearby galaxies , whose properties are listed and illustrated respectively in table 1 and fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "we constructed surface brightness profiles for all galaxies combining datasets with different spatial resolution and field of view .",
    "we started from the @xmath18 band images from the two - micron all sky survey ( hereafter , 2mass ) .",
    "since these data do not have a sufficient spatial resolution for our purposes ( 2 - 3@xmath10 ; the pixel scale of the 2mass images retrieved from the archive is 1 ) , we complemented the photometric profiles extracted from the 2mass images with profiles extracted from nir hst images ( f160w ) , available for 11 out of 18 cases ( marked with a single or double dagger in table [ tab1ch4 ] ) . to improve the spatial resolution at small radii for the remaining galaxies we used optical hst images ( f814w , corresponding to the @xmath19 band ) .",
    "since , on the other hand , 2mass is rather shallow ( reliable profiles can be extracted out to @xmath5 5 - 8 kpc for most of our galaxies ) , we needed an additional dataset for the outer parts , so that the disk geometry could be determined unambiguously , and an accurate sky level could be determined .",
    "for this reason , we decided to complement the profiles also with profiles extracted from infrared band . ] images from the digitized sky survey ( hereafter , dss ) , which are very deep , and therefore radially very extended .",
    "this also allows us a more accurate determination of the sky background .",
    "the dss , 2mass and nicmos images downloaded from the archives were fully reduced , so we did not apply any further processing ; as for the wfpc2-f814w images , we first created a mosaic from the four chips in order to maximize the field of view , using the iraf task wmosaic in the stsdas.hst_calib.wfpc package , rotated the resulting image to orient it to north up - east left and performed cosmic rays removal , using the iraf tasks crrej and lacos_im , created by pieter van dokkum and available via his website .",
    "as a first step , we extracted the photometric profiles from the dss images using the iraf task ellipse in the stsdas.analysis.isophote package , which fits elliptical isophotes to galaxy images , implementing the method initially described by kent ( 1983 , 1984 ) and @xcite .",
    "we masked out bad pixels and foreground stars , but did not exclude dust lanes and star forming regions from the fitting .",
    "we first fitted ellipses to the images with the centre , position angle and ellipticity left as free parameters . in this way we obtained profiles of the centre",
    "coordinates ; from these profiles we established the position of the centres , kept fixed in the following steps . in case of ambiguity , the centre was determined using isophotes at intermediate radii , since the very central ones can be affected by dust obscuration , and , in the particular case of the dss images , by the seeing ( or even by saturation of the images , in the worst cases ) .",
    "+ we then fitted again ellipses to the images with the centre fixed at the chosen position and ellipticity and position angle free . from this second step",
    "we determined single values for the geometric parameters .",
    "in many cases in the outer parts of the galaxies , outside the nuclear region , the position angle and ellipticity converge to more or the less constant values . in other cases",
    "the situation is more complicated , especially for galaxies that are almost round , and there we picked the values that looked more reasonable at a visual inspection of the shape of the isophotes in the images .",

    "in recent years , several studies have shown that many spiral galaxies host in their innermost regions an extra component , distinguishable in the images and/or photometric profiles as an excess light above the ( exponential ) disk plus ( srsic ) bulge .",
    "nuclei are common both in early- and late- type galaxies .",
    "@xcite found unresolved bright nuclei in six out of 10 late - type spirals ; @xcite noticed a compact star cluster in the centres of 10 very late - type spirals , within a program studying 49 objects ; out of a sample of 77 scd - sm galaxies , @xcite detected a distinct component in 59 cases . in some of the late - type spirals ,",
    "these clusters are the only prominent source within a few kiloparsecs from the centre . in earlier - types",
    "their detection is complicated by the presence of a luminous and extended bulge , but @xcite showed that nuclear clusters are present also there .",
    "as already mentioned , @xcite found a central light excess in 90 percent of a sample of s0-sbc galaxies using nicmos imaging , detecting both unresolved and extended sources ; according to the authors , the extended inner components are geometrically flat systems and could be inner disks , rings or bars ; the unresolved ones are most likely star clusters and are found in more than one third of the galaxies with inner component . + in our sample , two galaxies out of 18 ( ngc864 and ngc4102 ) present a central depression and the remaining 16 show a central light excess above the best - fit to the bulge ; one of these ( ngc5678 ) is an ambiguous case , possibly because of the very extended dust lanes affecting this galaxy , but we included it in the ` central component ' group .",

    "+    for all the 16 galaxies , we built model images of the bulges on the basis of the fit parameters , and subtracted them from the hst ` bulge images ' ( nicmos or wfpc2-f814w depending on the object ) .",
    "the images that we obtained contain by construction the residuals from the global ( exponential ) disk + ( srsic ) bulge fit to the galaxy : dust features , spiral structure , bars , and the inner component in which we are interested .",
    "we estimated the hwhm of the central component using the task , resulting in values ranging between @xmath5 0.07 and 0.23 .",
    "we then calculated the flux enclosed in a circle of radius twice the hwhm and converted it to a magnitude scale ( @xmath18 band ) . for ngc 4102 and",

    "we also see that the @xmath2 colors of the nuclei are similar within 0.2 mag to the colors in the inner aperture with diameter 2.4@xmath10 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "even though only about 10% of the light in the larger aperture comes from the nuclear cluster , it shows that the stellar populations of the nuclear cluster are not decoupled from those in the rest of the galaxy , as is e.g. the case in globular clusters in galaxies .",

    "( 2006 ) took high resolution spectra for a number of the scd , sd and sm galaxies of bker et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and analysed them using stellar population synthesis , allowing the extinction to be fitted as a free parameter .",
    "they find an average extinction in @xmath26 of @xmath27 0.4 mag , which is very comparable to what we find ( a@xmath3 = 0.68 , with a scatter of 0.55 ) : when using the galactic extinction law ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) the extinction in @xmath0 is 1.64 @xmath11 the extinction in @xmath28 , or 0.66 mag .",
    "given the fact that the galaxies of walcher et al .",
    "are later type than ours , we expect less extinction than in our sample .",
    "however , large variations probably exist from galaxy to galaxy , and also the amount of extinction that one obtains varies with method .",

    "et al . ( 2007 ) we made extinction maps for 10 of the galaxies .",
    "we summarize below the main results .",
    "* late - type spirals can be fitted well by a model consisting of a srsic bulge , an exponential disk , and a nuclear light access . outside the central regions ,",
    "the bulk of the galaxy s light is well described by one exponential disk , although in some cases a double exponential ( inner + outer disk ) would provide better fits , as tested by @xcite . in most cases bulges",
    "are rounder than their disks , but for the latest types the opposite sometimes holds , possibly in relation with the presence of a bar .",
    "* bulges of late - type spiral galaxies follow the same relation between central velocity dispersion and bulge luminosity as bulges of early - type spirals .",
    "this might indicate that the black hole - sigma relation also holds for late - type spiral bulges .",
    "late - type bulges have , however , lower surface brightness and are larger than early - type bulges . *",
    "the structural parameters of our bulges agree statistically with the large compilation of graham & worley ( 2008 ) , showing a strong correlation between surface brightness of bulge and disk , and a less strong relation between bulge effective radius and disk scale length . *",
    "the star formation time scale inversely correlates with the srsic index @xmath4 , implying that exponential bulges have long star formation time scales , in agreement with the prediction from secular evolution models , that exponential bulges are disks forming through secular evolution . * in 16 out of 18 galaxies the galaxy s profile presents an excess light with respect to the fitted disk + bulge , which can be interpreted as an additional tiny component , in many cases ( in all the later types ) a nuclear star cluster .",
    "we give an estimate of the magnitude of these inner components . * using @xmath2 colour maps from hst imaging and sauron mg  b maps , we have determined model - independent extinction maps for 10 of the 18 galaxies .",
    "we find that the central a@xmath3 ranges from 0 to 2 mag , with many galaxies being optically thick in the optical .",
    "the @xmath2 profiles show a lot of structure , mostly due to extinction , with much larger gradients than are generally displayed by early - type galaxies . *",
    "the colours of nuclear clusters are the same as the inner regions of their host galaxies , with a scatter of 0.2 mag , indicating a similar composition and age as the stellar populations just outside the center , unlike e.g. galactic globular clusters .",

    "this corresponds to the first step in our procedure , as we described above . since there is no overlap between their sample and ours , we chose some galaxies out of their paper ( ngc4353 , 4440 , 4600 , 4706 and 4743 ) , retrieved the 2mass and dss images for these galaxies and extracted brightness profiles with free geometric parameters , subtracted an estimate for the sky background , combined them into a single profile and converted the latter to an absolute magnitude scale in the same way as done for our own galaxies -we only skipped the steps where we fix the geometric parameters , for consistency with the approach used by @xcite .",

    "in this appendix we present a large number of relations , between structural parameters and luminosity of bulge , disk and total galaxy , and between structural and stellar population parameters .",
    "a few of these have already been discussed in section 5 . for the relations between structural parameters and luminosity of bulge ,",
    "disk and total galaxy we find that our late type spiral galaxies generally behave in the same way as the compilation of graham & worley ( 2008 ) . in section 5.1 and 5.2",
    "the most important correlations were discussed . here",
    "we discuss more relations , for completeness .",
    "we start looking at the relations between the structural parameters of bulge and disk and global galaxy properties such as morphological type and velocity dispersion .",
    "we plot these parameters against each other in fig .",
    "[ fig10ch4aa ] and [ fig10ch4b ] , for our sample with the compilation of gw always plotted as well to guide the eye .",
    "if we focus on our sample only , we can notice some trends : @xmath4 tends to decrease going to later types , and both the effective surface brightness of the bulge and the central surface brightness of the disk decrease going to later types .",
    "these correlations agree with gw and b07 .",
    "interesting to note is that for galaxies earlier than sbc surface brightness of bulge and disk is virtually independent of type . for later types",
    "there is a strong correlation .",
    "there galaxies become smaller , and have lower surface brightness of both bulge and disk , for increasing morphological type ( see also de jong 1996 , paper iii ) .",
    "we confirm that there is no strong corelation between the size of bulges and disk and morphological type . also , the size ratio r@xmath30/h is independent of type , and we do not find the mild decrease that @xcite claim .",
    "see gw for an extended discussion about this ratio .",
    "the most important correlations with central celocity dispersion have been discussed in section 5.1 .",
    "we find that the effective radius of the bulge does not correlate with @xmath6 , nor does the scale length of the disk , or the ratio of bulge effective radius to disk scale length .",
    "there is a good correlation between bulge luminosity and @xmath6 ( see also b07 ) and between bulge to disk ratio and @xmath6 .    in fig .",

    "since later type spiral galaxies tend to be fainter , we find that the shape parameter @xmath4 increases with the luminosity of the bulge , disk or the whole galaxy .",
    "the relation between the bulge magnitude m@xmath31 and @xmath4 ( top right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig11ch4a ] ) is particularly tight : the correlation coefficient @xmath32 is @xmath33 , and it becomes even tighter ( @xmath34 ) when removing the outlier point representing ngc864 . as shown by b07 in their figure 6c , spiral galaxies",
    "follow the same trend as the virgo ellipticals from @xcite in the plane ( m@xmath13 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "we find a marginally significant correlation between bulge luminosity and effective radius , in the sense that brighter bulges are also larger . when the whole compilation of gw is considered this correlation is not found . in general ,",
    "when the bulge luminosity increases , the srsic index @xmath4 decreases , and the surface brightness increases , with constant effective radius . for late type",
    "spirals only , which all have a similar srsic index ( @xmath4=1 ) , there is apparently a tendency that both @xmath35 and r@xmath30 increase .",
    "the marginally significant correlation between disk luminosity and disk scale length is probably caused by the two bright outliers .",
    "the b / d luminosity ratio increases as galaxy bulges become more luminous , while it does not show strong trends with the disk magnitude m@xmath36 . in general , from this work we infer that several correlations between structural properties of spiral galaxies are tighter versus m@xmath13 than versus m@xmath36 ( see table  [ tab3ch4 ] ) , in agreement with the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "this is particularly intriguing , implying that ( some of ) the properties are driven by the mass of the bulge .",
    "gw , who find the same strong relation , also comment that these new decompositions , with srsic rather than de vaucouleurs bulge , show that very few spirals have b / t @xmath37 1/3 .",
    "in a long discussion gw confirm this conclusion , and point out that the b / d ratios in cosmological galaxy simulations are on the average much larger , showing that the models , or probably the recipes for supernova feedback , need to be improved considerably .",

    "the stellar population parameters refer to a central aperture of radius 15 .",
    "@xmath39mg__b__@xmath40 is the difference in magnitudes between the observed mg_b _ index and the prediction , based on the observed velocity dispersion , given by the mg@xmath42 relation published by @xcite , which is now believed to hold for old spheroids ( see discussion in @xcite ) ; @xmath39mg__b__@xmath40 is therefore a measure of the importance of young populations in the galaxy . for the sake of clarity , we remind the reader that @xmath43 can be derived from @xmath44 and @xmath6 in the following way , adopting the mg@xmath42 relation from jorgensen , expressed as in eq . 3 in the paper of @xcite , the definition of mg__b__@xmath40 inferred from eq . 2 in the same paper and the conversion between mg@xmath45 and mg__b__@xmath40 given in eq .",
    "4 there :      going back to fig .",
    "[ fig12ch4 ] and to the description of the quantities involved here , the age is the single stellar population ( ssp)-equivalent age inferred by comparison of observed line - strength indices with models and @xmath41 is the @xmath47-folding time - scale for star formation , assuming a galaxy age of 10 gyr and an exponentially declining star formation rate with time .",
    "for details we refer the reader to sections 5.3 , 6.1 and 6.3 , in @xcite .",
    "we can observe some trends , a few of which significant ( @xmath48 ) , in those cases we have also plotted the correlation as a dashed line : when h@xmath12 increases , i.e. when the stellar population becomes younger , @xmath4 decreases , both @xmath49 and @xmath50 become fainter , and the disk scale length h and the bulge effective radius @xmath38 decrease .",
    "there are also indications that both @xmath38 and h become smaller with @xmath39mg__b__@xmath40 becoming more negative , which means that galaxies farther away from the mg@xmath42 relation of old ellipticals , i.e. younger galaxies , have both smaller bulges and smaller disks .",
    "no relevant trend is found with age : possibly a confirmation of the fact that , in general , ssp - equivalent ages and metallicities are not a good approximation for spiral galaxies , as discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more relevant parameter for our galaxies seems to be @xmath41 , in the framework of a continuous star formation : as @xmath41 increases ( and the star formation history is less and less well described by a single burst ) , @xmath4 becomes smaller , @xmath51 and @xmath52 become fainter and @xmath38 and h become smaller .",
    "no significant trend is observed involving the ratio @xmath53h ratio and the b / d luminosity ratio .",
    "globally , fig .",
    "[ fig12ch4 ] seem to corroborate a scenario where galaxies with a quiescent , almost constant star formation , hosting composite stellar populations , with ( at least ) some young stars , have almost - exponential bulges and small and faint bulges and disks , while galaxies that formed stars in a single burst long ago ( more ssp - like ) tend to have higher @xmath4 and bigger and brighter bulges and disks .",
    "a similar scenario , in which the character of the star formation history is replaced by the galaxy age , is suggested also by @xcite , as we mentioned earlier : exponential bulges would be young products of secular evolution ; as the galaxy ages , the bulges would grow and their @xmath4 increase .",
