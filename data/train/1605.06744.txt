    ", the dbp basis has been only discussed from the cagd point of view ( see the works of lewanowicz and wozny e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "so it is of interest to explore some new aspects of this basis in order to facilitate the numerical methods for differential equations that are based on bernstein polynomials and to present a method for time fractional diffusion equation in two dimensions .",

    ", we use this idea for the non - orthogonal bernstein polynomials to present a simple and accurate dual - petrov - galerkin spectral method for two - dimensional subdiffusion equation .",
