    "iras detected a new class of galaxy with large bolometric luminosity dominated by the far - infrared ( fir ) , e.g. , sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) .",
    "the most extreme objects in this class , indeed among the most extreme in the universe , are the hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hlirgs : rowan - robinson 2000 ) . with fir luminosites in excess of @xmath3",
    ", their star formation rates would have to exceed 1000 @xmath4yr@xmath2 if powered solely by stellar processes .",
    "it is known that a large fraction of luminous ir galaxies display emission lines in their optical spectra characteristic of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and this fraction rises as the bolometric luminosity of the objects increases ( veilleux et al . 1995 ) .",
    "there has been considerable debate over whether the primary power source comes from the agn ( e.g. , sanders 1999 ) or star formation ( e.g. , genzel et al 1998 ) .",
    "given the abundant obscuration , it has been extremely difficult to satisfactorily resolve this issue , and indeed it is clear that both processes are usually important ( e.g. farrah et al . 2003 ) .",
    "new observations from space ( iso and spitzer ) and ground - based observatories , have brought about great progress in studying these very dusty objects , but the penetrating power of hard x - rays make them a powerful complementary probe .",
    "accreting black holes are efficient x - ray emitters , and the agn in some luminous ir galaxies like ngc4945 and ngc6240 were found first with hard x - ray observations ( iwasawa et al 1993 ; done et al 1996 ; iwasawa & comastri 1998 ; vignati et al 1999 ; see armus et al 2006 and risaliti et al 2006 for evidence of active nuclei based on infrared properties ) .",
    "these objects are very heavily obscured and the absorption towards the x - ray nucleus is often compton thick , i.e. the column density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the thomson cross section . if @xmath7 greatly exceeds this value , even the direct hard x - rays may be blocked , but a hidden agn can still be revealed through its reflected light . in the typical bandpass ( @xmath8 kev ) of high sensitivity x - ray observatories like chandra and _ xmm - newton _ , the spectrum is characterised by a flat continuum , with photon index @xmath9 accompanied by a very strong fe k@xmath10 emission line close to 6.4 kev .",
    "this characteristic spectrum has been observed in many nearby seyfert 2 galaxies ( e.g. , matt et al 2000 ) .",
    "at least two classical hlirgs , iras 09104 + 4109 ( kleinmann et al 1988 ) and iras f15307 + 3252 ( cutri et al 1994 ) have also been found to host compton thick agn ( franceschini et al 2000 ; iwasawa et al 2001 ; iwasawa et al 2005 ) . despite the difficulties in identifying compton thick agn they are of widespread importance , as their precise numbers are crucial for models of the x - ray background ( e.g. gilli et al . 2007 ) , the accretion budget of the universe ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) and last , but not least , the power source in objects like hlirgs .",
    "iras 001827112 ( = iras f001837111 ) is an hlirg discovered by iras ( rowan - robinson 2000 ) and optically identified at a redshift @xmath11 ( saunders et al 1988 ) . unlike the two classical hlirgs mentioned above , which show seyfert-2 characteristics in their optical spectra , iras 001827112 has a colder iras colour and has the optical spectrum of liner , with no high - excitation emission - lines indicating the presence of agn ( armus et al .",
    "even the mid - infrared spectrum is devoid of agn emission lines ( spoon et al 2004 ) .",
    "instead it is characterised by a deep slicate absorption and weak pah features ( spoon et al 2006 ) .",
    "the continuum is carved by deep silicate , hydrocarbon and various ice absorption features in the iso and spitzer data ( spoon et al 2002 , 2004 ) , which suggests the power source , be it an agn or stars , must lie behind heavy obscuration .",
    "the possible presence of an agn is , however , suggested by a mid - ir hot dust component similar to that in ngc1068 ( e.g. , sturm et al 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , the compact radio core , which is not resolved at 1 arcsec resolution of the vlbi ( drake et al .",
    "2004 ) , has a flux significantly above the fir - radio correlation for star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , appleton et al 2004 ) , indicating the radio source might be powered by an agn . here ,",
    "we present xmm - newton observation of this hlirg to investigate further the possible presence of an agn and the origin of the large infrared luminosity .",
    "the currently popular cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is assumed in this paper . with @xmath11 ,",
    "the luminosity and angular distances are @xmath15 mpc and @xmath16 mpc and the angular scale is 4.5 kpc arcsec@xmath2 . because of the different cosmology assumed here from the original definition of hlirgs , the infrared luminosity of iras 00182 7112 is @xmath17 , slightly under @xmath18 .",
    "iras 001827112 was observed with xmm - newton ( obsid 0147570101 ) on 2003 april 17 .",
    "the useful exposure times for the epic pn and mos cameras are 10 ks and 12 ks , respectively , after discarding time intervals of high particle background in the 22 ks pointing duration .",
    "the data were taken in full - frame mode with the thin filter in place .",
    "the data reduction was carried out using the stardard xmm sas 7.0 and ftools .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed using the xspec version 11.3 ( arnaud et al 1996 ) .",
    "a source was detected at the position of the hlirg with observed fluxes of @xmath19 in the 0.52 kev band and @xmath20 in the 210 kev band . the total 0.3 - 10 kev source counts obtained with the pn and two mos cameras are 169 and 167 counts , respectively .",
    "source spectra were extracted from a circle with radius 25@xmath21 , with background extracted from neighbouring source  free regions .",
    "the mos1 and mos2 spectra were co - added .",
    "we have adopted two different binnings for the spectra . when determining the emission line parameters below , to maintain sufficient resolution we rebinned the pn spectrum to a minimum of 12 counts per bin , and the mos spectrum to 7 counts per bin , and determined the parameters using a maximum likelihood c - statistic ( cash 1976 ) .",
    "when determining the broad - band properties we use a standard @xmath22 fit and have binned the spectra to a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "the x - ray source is clearly rather hard , with many of the counts collected above 2 kev . fig .",
    "1 shows epic pn and mos combined images of the source in the 0.31 kev and 29 kev bands .",
    "while the hard band image is centred at the optical position of the galaxy , the peak of the faint soft x - ray emission appears to be displaced to the east .",
    "by @xmath23 `` , corresponding to @xmath24 kpc .",
    "the soft emission appears slightly extended , however , and the centroid of the emission is displaced by only 2.4 '' . fitting the psf of the epic - pn to the soft and hard images we estimate the errors in the centroid positions to be 0.6 `` for the hard image and 2 '' for the soft ,",
    "so the displacement is only marginally significant , and awaits verification by a better quality image .",
    "we note , however , that there might be a link to the optical superwind nebula traced by [ oiii ] , which extends @xmath25 kpc to the east and @xmath26 kpc to the west ( heckman , armus & miley 1990 ) ; the r band image taken by drake et al ( 2003 ) also shows an extension to the east .",
    "the soft x - ray emission is similar to these optical features in direction and size , and could therefore be associated with the superwind , rather than the hlirg nucleus .",
    "the x - ray spectrum obtained from the epic pn and mos data is flat ( @xmath27 ) with a weak excess below 1 kev .",
    "we first consider the hard band @xmath28  kev spectrum .",
    "strong line emission at around 5 kev in the observers frame is seen , which can be identified with redshifted fe k@xmath0 .",
    "weak emission lines are sometimes seen in this energy range due to instrumental background .",
    "we have verified that the line feature is not a residual of the instrumental cr line at @xmath29 kev by inspecting three narrow band images : 4.85.2 kev , which contains the redshifted fe k@xmath0 line feature , and two neighbouring bands with the same energy width of 0.4 kev .",
    "the 4.8 - 5.2 kev image shows a clear excess relative to the neighbouring bands .",
    "when modeled by a single gaussian , the centroid of the line is found at @xmath30 kev in the rest - frame ( c - stat fit ; errors here and henceforth are 90 per cent confidence for one parameter of interest , @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) , which indicates that the major component of the line is fe xxv , i.e. he - like iron .",
    "cold fe k@xmath10 ( less ionized than fexvii ) at 6.4 kev , which is usually found in absorbed agn , is ruled out at the @xmath33 per cent confidence level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cstat ] ) .",
    ", width=188 ]    the 2 - 10 kev continuum is hard and shows some curvature towards the soft x - ray consistent with the effect of absorption .",
    "formally , the spectrum can be fitted with a hot thermal plasma , as long as strong absorption is allowed .",
    "assuming solar metallicity ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , the mekal model gives a temperature of @xmath34 kev and @xmath35 , as measured in the galaxy rest frame , with @xmath36 for 14 degrees of freedom .",
    "the fe k@xmath0 line is well fitted in this model .",
    "the absorption corrected bolometric luminosity of this thermal emission spectrum is @xmath37 .",
    "the luminosity already rivals luminous agn and exceeds the range of galaxy groups . in principle",
    "it could be produced by a moderately rich cluster , but then we would expect the emission to be unabsorbed and significantly extended , so this can be ruled out .",
    "high temperature thermal plasmas like this are also present in the nuclei of starburst galaxies , e.g. ngc253 ( pietsch et al 2001 , but see also weaver et al 2002 ) , and ulirgs ( e.g. arp220 ; iwasawa et al 2005 ) .",
    "the luminosity in iras 001827112 is much too large to be accounted for by these effects , with the above examples showing luminosities of only @xmath38  erg s@xmath2 . even if we scale the emission of arp 220 by @xmath39 this predicts only @xmath40for iras 001827112 , far below the observed hard x - ray luminosity .",
    "given the large absorbing column , the source behind the absorbing gas is likely to be located in a very compact region .",
    "the implied column density agrees well with that of the obscuring material probed by the mid - ir spectrum ( see discussion ) , so it is natural to locate the hard x - ray source inside this region .",
    "the thickness of this warm inner shell is @xmath41 pc ( spoon et al .",
    "2004 ) , located at a distance of 0.5 - 2 pc ( lutz et al .",
    "2004 ) so it appears to take the form of a thin shell . conservatively , if we adopt a spherical geometry with a radius of 1 pc , the distance appropriate for an obscuring torus ( e.g. , krolik & begelman 1988 ) and consistent with specific estimates for iras 001827112 itself ( lutz et al .",
    "2004 ) , the gas density implied from the thermal spectrum is of the order of @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "this violates our assumption of an optically thin plasma but in any case , such a dense plasma would cool too fast ( @xmath44 yr ) to be observed . given these considerations ,",
    "we consider it implausible that the emission is thermal and is much more likely to be produced by an agn .",
    "the hard continuum can be modeled as a power - law with @xmath45 , a typical value for seyfert nuclei ignoring the effects of reflection , and a cold absorbing column with @xmath46 .",
    "the he - like fe k line is unresolved when modelled with a narrow gaussian , and is very strong with a flux of @xmath47 photon @xmath48 s@xmath2 corresponding to an equivalent width ( ew ) in the rest frame of @xmath49  ev",
    ". a weaker line could be present at 6.4 kev but with its ew less than 300 ev ( 90 per cent upper limit ) .",
    "the large ew of the he - like line indicates that we are not seeing the direct emission from the central source , as such a large ew is only observed in a reflection - dominated spectrum .",
    "the fe k line centroid rules out cold gas as the reflecting medium .",
    "this leads us to introduce reflection from highly ionized matter .",
    "here we use the model of ross & fabian ( 2005 ) , which computes reflection spectra from the upper layer of a slab of optically thick matter , like an accretion disk , illuminated by an x - ray source .",
    "we assumed the illuminating source has a spectral slope of @xmath50 ( appropriate for the intrinsic spectrum ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) and the fe abundance of the reflecting matter to be solar .",
    "the 29 kev spectrum agrees well with the refection model with an ionization parameter @xmath51 erg cm s@xmath2 , modified by absorption of @xmath52  ( @xmath53 for 14 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the value of @xmath54 is constrained mostly by the energy and strength of the fe k feature and the 90 per cent confidence range is @xmath55 .",
    "the absorption - corrected rest frame 210 kev luminosity is @xmath56 .      because of the possible spatial displacement and its correspondence to the extended optical features",
    ", we think that the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath57 kev ) is different in origin from the hard x - ray emission . by analogy to the extended nebulae seen in nearby starburst galaxies , the soft x - rays are probably due to thermal emission with a temperature of @xmath58 k. a mekal thermal emission spectrum ( kaastra 1999 ) with @xmath59 kev and solar metallicity , modified only with galactic absorption @xmath60(dickey & lockman 1990 ) , gives a good fit to the 0.5 - 2 kev data , but the data quality means the parameters are very poorly constrained .",
    "an origin in extended photoionised gas is also possible , as seen in nearby seyfert 2s ( e.g. guainazzi & bianchi 2007 ) .",
    "the rest - frame , absorption - corrected 0.52 kev luminosity is estimated to be @xmath61 , which is slightly more luminous than classical nearby ulirgs ( iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "it is about a factor 4 lower than the @xmath62 ratio of nearby starburst galaxies ( e.g. , ranalli , comastri & setti 2003 ) .",
    "the 12 kev region is the noisiest range of the spectrum and so far has been omitted from the spectral fits presented above . considering this region we see possible evidence for a line - like excess at 2 kev . if thermal , this is is unlikely to be associated with the soft emission as the only plausible identification is with sulphur and would require a large overabundance ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "an origin in photoionized gas seems more likely , as the feature could be a blend of sxvi ly@xmath0 and sixiv radiative recombination continuum ( rrc ) . in principle",
    "this could arise via the same mechanism as that producing the fe k@xmath0 line , i.e. x - ray reflection , but with a lower @xmath54= 100 - 300 erg cm s@xmath2 .",
    "this seems reasonable because photoionized plasmas around agn are expected to , and generally show a wide range of ionization parameter ( e.g krolik & kriss 2001 ; kinkhabwala et al 2002 ) . with this caveat , and to keep the spectral model simple , we have tested only a single ionized reflection component , together with the soft thermal emission , against the broad - band spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the reflection spectrum is modified by absorption intrinsic to the object and the thermal component is modified only by the galactic extinction .",
    "the results hold for the soft thermal emission as in section 4.2 but the ionization parameter of the reflection spectrum shifts to the intermediate value of @xmath64 erg cm s@xmath2 , as expected , and the absorption column density decreases to @xmath65 .",
    "this two - component model agrees with the broad - band data very well , with @xmath66 for 21 degrees of freedom .",
    "the xmm - newton observation of iras 001827111 has revealed a very luminous , hard x - ray source co - incident with the nucleus .",
    "the large x - ray luminosity observed in the hard band would normally be an immediate indication of an agn .",
    "however , given that the inferred star formation rate in this object may be one of the highest in the universe , further discussion is warranted to see whether stellar processes might account for the luminosity . in nearby star forming galaxies ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission is generally attributed to x - ray binaries , and there is a roughly linear relationship between the hard x - ray luminosity and infrared luminosity , and hence the star formation rate ( e.g. , david et al .",
    "1992 ; nandra et al 2002 ; ranalli et al 2003 ; grimm et al 2003 ) .",
    "franceschini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have suggested that young starburst systems like ulirgs may follow a somewhat different relationship , but the hard x - ray luminosity can still be used to estimate the star formation rate .    taking the most conservative of the published calibrations ( grimm et al .",
    "2003 ) , the star formation rate derived from the hard x - ray luminosity in iras 001827112 would be @xmath67 yr@xmath2 , while the star formation rate converted from the infrared luminosity ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ) is about 1,000 @xmath4 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the hard x - rays are overluminous for a starburst alone .",
    "moreover , the intense , narrow , he - like fe k line rules out x - ray binaries as the major component of the hard x - ray emission .",
    "thermal emission from hot gas is highly unlikely , as discussed in section 4.1 , so the evidence overwhelmingly points to an agn origin for the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of iras 001827111 is characterised by a flat , hard continuum and intense iron emission .",
    "these are both tell - tale signs of a hidden , compton ",
    "thick agn ( reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ; matt et al .",
    "remarkably , we find in this case that the reflection - dominated spectrum arises from very highly ionized gas , with iron predominantly in the he - like fe xxv state .",
    "fe xxv and even fe xxvi have been seen in seyfert 2s ( e.g. , ngc1068 , marshall et al 1993 ; ueno et al 1994 ; iwasawa , fabian & matt 1997 ) , but the dominant feature in compton thick agn is always the cold 6.4 kev line .",
    "as far as we are aware , iras 001827111 is unique among obscured agn in exhibiting a reflection  dominated spectrum from ionized gas , so the origin of the line emission in this object is probably quite different to that in seyfert 2s .",
    "having established the presence of an agn , it is natural to assess its contribution to the overall energy budget .",
    "the directly - viewed , absorption - corrected 2 - 10 kev luminosity is @xmath68 , but this is only the reflected light of a hidden illuminating source .",
    "the reflection efficiency depends on the ionisation parameter , and for a 2 - 10 kev albedo @xmath69 , the illuminating luminosity required to produce the observed reflection is @xmath70 the appropriate albedo for an ionized reflecting medium can be estimated from the work of ross & fabian ( 2005 ) , yielding @xmath71 .",
    "it is unlikely that all the illuminated , ionized medium is visible to us .",
    "this introduces a geometrical correction factor of @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the solid angle that the ionized reflecting medium occupies in the sky viewed from the source but also visible to the observer . while we have assumed an optically thick medium for the calculation of the reflection spectrum , the optical depth of the reflecting medium is in reality unknown , and if @xmath74 the reflection is reduced correspondingly .",
    "if these corrections are included in a factor @xmath75 , the illuminating source has @xmath76 .",
    "the bolometric correction , @xmath77 , is typically 0.05 for high - luminosity agn ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "the bolometric agn luminosity is then estimated as @xmath78 erg s@xmath2 , or @xmath79",
    "@xmath80 for the fiducial values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "our best estimate is therefore that the agn dominates the total fir luminosity of @xmath17 , albeit with very large uncertainties .",
    "other evidence supports this conclusion .",
    "the properties of the soft x - ray emission below 1 kev are consistent with thermal emission powered by a starburst , though a contribution from photoionized gas can not be excluded with the present data quality .",
    "it is plausibly offset and/or extended from the nucleus in a manner co - incident with the extended optical emission , and the spectrum is soft and unabsorbed . the inferred star - formation rate from the soft x  ray luminosity ( ranalli et al .",
    "2003 ) is @xmath83 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is lower than the fir - inferred star formation rate , and therefore consistent with the idea that there is another major contributor to the fir power .",
    "this is also indicated by the mid - ir data .",
    "we have already mentioned that the spitzer spectrum is dominated by absorption and shows weak pah emission . the star formation linked to the pah emission",
    "must be located outside the central obscuration , and that star - formation rate derived from the pah luminosity accounts for only up to 30 per cent of the bolometric luminosity ( spoon et al 2004 ) .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the soft x - ray derived star formation rate .    on the face of it , the ionized emission line seen in iras",
    "001827111 is at odds with the observed flat continuum shape .",
    "with fe in the he - like state , the lighter elements able to suppress the soft x - rays in the reflecting medium will be mostly stripped . in our spectral modeling",
    ", we account for this by an additional absorption column of @xmath84  in the line of sight .",
    "this can be identified with the same matter absorbing the mid - ir continuum .",
    "spoon et al ( 2004 ) identified two layers of obscuring material : a cold , outer shell responsible for the ice and silicate absorption and a warm , inner ( gas-)shell inferred from the co absorption band at 4.67@xmath85 m .",
    "the properties of these shells of particular interest to us are the thickness of the inner shell , which is constrained to be smaller than 0.03 pc , its location at @xmath86  pc and the estimated equivalent hydrogen column density of the order of @xmath87  for both shells .",
    "the small size of the inner shell , and the the total column density agrees perfectly with that needed to provide the necessary suppression of the nuclear ( reflected ) soft x - rays .",
    "if we are correct in our assessment that iras 00182 - 7111 hosts a compton thick agn , it implies that the line  of  sight to the nucleus is much more heavily obscured than those to both the source of the reflected x - rays , and the mid - ir emission .",
    "it is also worth noting that the fact that we can see the hot dust means that not all the directions from the central source are obscured as heavily as the line of sight .",
    "this argues for a torus - type geometry for the ir absorber . a combination of detailed x - ray and mid - ir observations can therefore help disentangle the geometry of the very innermost regions .    in compton thick seyfert 2s ,",
    "the obscuration and reflection is associated with the torus envisaged in orientation - dependent unification schemes ( e.g. antonucci & miller 1985 ) .",
    "this is an obvious identification in iras 001827111 , and it is tempting to associate the high ionization seen in iras 001827111 with its hyper - luminous classification .",
    "intense illumination from the powerful central source might ionize the surface of any obscuring torus . in this regard",
    "it is worth considering the constraints on the physical condition of the reflecting medium .",
    "taking an ionizing luminosity @xmath88 , a density @xmath89 @xmath43 , similar to that of the mid - ir co absorption layer ( spoon et al 2004 ) , and ionization parameter @xmath90 erg cm s@xmath2 , the distance of the reflecting medium from the central source can be expressed as @xmath91 pc .",
    "this is consistent with a torus origin ( lutz et al .",
    "if the depth of the medium is assumed to be @xmath92 , the reflection column density is @xmath93@xmath48 , or roughly @xmath94 .",
    "this is also a plausible optical depth for the torus .",
    "an alternative is to associate the reflector with hot gas filling the torus , and in this case it may have a lower optical depth .",
    "krolik & kallman ( 1987 ) have predicted ionized iron line emission from this medium , and it is seen in local seyfert 2 galaxies such as ngc 1068 ( marshall et al . 1993 ; iwasawa et al .",
    "it is difficult to see how such a medium would be confined , and one possibility is that we are seeing x - ray reflection from a hot outflow .",
    "the superwind seen in the optical may in fact be an agn - driven outflow , and the soft x - ray emission could arise either via radiative heating , or shock heating of the interstellar medium by this wind .",
    "such agn - driven winds have received much recent attention as they can provide the necessary link between black hole accretion and bulge formation via agn feedback ( e.g. silk & rees 1988 ) .",
    "several authors have suggested evolutionary links between ulirgs and agn ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "for example , recent numerical simulations suggest that massive galaxies undergo violent merger - driven star formation and obscured agn activity ( hopkins et al . 2005 ) .",
    "eventually , accretion powered winds can sweep up gas from the galaxy , terminating star formation and leaving a red bulge - dominated remnant .",
    "iras 001827112 may represent an example of a galaxy undergoing its obscured accretion phase , and be in the process of quenching its star formation .",
    "future high resolution x - ray spectroscopy ( with , e.g. xeus or constellation - x ) could reveal shifts and profile distortions in both the iron k@xmath0 line and the soft x - ray emission lines characteristic of such an outflow .    the x - ray detection of an agn in iras 001827112 could have important implications for surveys of hlirgs at high redshift .",
    "houck et al ( 2005 ) , for instance , found a number of hlirg candidates at @xmath95 in a spitzer survey of sources with mips 24 @xmath96 m detection .",
    "they argued that many of them were powered predominantly by agn , largely relying on the similarity of their irs mid - ir spectra to that of iras 001827112 .",
    "the fact that we now have robust evidence for a powerful agn in iras 001827112 argues that these other hlirgs do as well .",
    "based on optical emission line diagnostics , as many as 50  per cent of hlirgs are thought to host an agn .",
    "the optical classification of iras 001827112 is that of a liner ( almus et al .",
    "1987 ) , hinting that there may be a large additional population of agn - hosting hlirgs without obvious optical , or for that matter mid - ir , agn signatures .",
    "in fact , sufficiently deep x - ray observations could in principle reveal a buried agn in all hlirgs .",
    "the connection between agn - dominated hlirgs and submillimetre galaxies ( smgs ) at high - redshift is unclear .",
    "while agn do seem to be common in smgs , the agn contribution to the total energy budget appears to be minor ( alexander et al 2005a ) . in this respect , one archetypal hlirg , the gravitationally - lensed iras f10214 + 4724 at @xmath97 ( rowan - robinson 2000 ) appears more like a smg in nature ( alexander et al 2005b ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that our estimate of the bolometric contribution of the agn in iras 001827112 relies on a relatively high quality x - ray spectral decomposition , which is not yet possible for most smgs .",
    "very sensitive future x - ray observation are required for a definitive test of whether these too are mainly powered by agn , or starbursts .",

    "<S> a luminous hard x - ray source co - incident with the nucleus is revealed , along with weaker soft x - ray emission which may be extended or offset from the hard . </S>",
    "<S> the epic spectrum is extremely flat and shows fe k@xmath0 emission with very high equivalent width : both are typical characteristics of a buried , compton  </S>",
    "<S> thick agn which is seen only in scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of the spectrum is that the fe k@xmath0 line energy is that of he - like iron , making iras 001827112 the first hidden agn known to be dominated by ionized , compton thick reflection . </S>",
    "<S> taking an appropriate bolometric correction we find that this agn could easily dominate the fir energetics . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear reflection spectrum is seen through a relatively cold absorber with column density consistent with recent spitzer observations . the soft x - ray emission , which may be thermal in nature and associated with star - forming activity , is seen unabsorbed . </S>",
    "<S> the soft x - rays and weak pah features both give estimates of the star formation rate @xmath1  yr@xmath2 , insufficient to power the fir emission and supportive of the idea that this hlirg is agn - dominated .    </S>",
