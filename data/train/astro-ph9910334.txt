    "one of the most important ingredients for the construction of a model of the formation of the galaxy concerns whether the globular clusters ( gcs ) in the galactic outer halo are younger or older than those in the inner halo ( e.g. , mironov & samus 1974 ; searle & zinn 1978 ; zinn 1980 , 1993 ; van den bergh 1993 ; majewski 1994 ) .",
    "the outer halo of the galaxy is not well populated . from table  7 in borissova",
    "et al . ( 1997 ) , one finds that in the  extreme \" outer halo ( galactocentric distances @xmath1  kpc ) there are five very scarcely populated and loose clusters with ( mostly ) red horizontal - branch ( hb ) morphologies ( palomar  3 , pal  4 , pal  14 , eridanus , and am-1 ) , and one cluster with a blue hb .",
    "this blue - hb globular ",

    "( hst ) observations have revealed that ngc  2419 is coeval with m92 ( ngc  6341 ) ( harris et al . 1997 ) , a much closer blue - hb globular which has always been considered to be among the very oldest gcs in the galaxy ( e.g. , bolte & hogan 1995 ; pont et al . 1998 ; salaris , deglinnocenti , & weiss 1997 ; vandenberg , bolte , & stetson 1996 ) .    until recently , however , little information was available on the ages of the remaining extreme outer - halo gcs .",
    "hst observations have again helped remedy the situation .",

    "lee , demarque , & zinn ( 1994 ) have recently stated :  only a small number of clusters have been dated to sufficiently high precision to test the hypothesis that the second parameter is age , and there is some doubt that the detected age differences are consistent with the hb morphologies of the clusters .",
    "if they are not , this would suggest that age can not be the sole second parameter .",
    "\" we concur with such a statement and emphasize , therefore , that tests of age as the second parameter can not be properly carried out without the required comparison with adequate models of the hb morphology of the clusters under consideration .",

    "pal  4 and eridanus have exclusively red hbs , making the computation of most of the above hb morphology indices meaningless for our purposes .    from the hst cmds ( see stetson et al . 1999 ) ,",
    "it is clear that both pal  4 and eridanus share very similar hb morphologies .",
    "a combined cmd for the two clusters is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the stars were de - reddened by the indicated amounts , based on schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the eridanus data were further shifted by @xmath20  mag , in order to account for the relative distance moduli of the two clusters ( vandenberg 1999a ) . as indicated by the vertical dotted line",

    "eridanus has a few ( @xmath22 ) stars scattered towards brighter magnitudes and redder colors than does pal  4 ; however , as shown below , this feature can be accounted for by statistical fluctuations related to the small number of hb stars ( a total of @xmath23 ) available in the hst samples and evolution away from the zero - age hb ( zahb ) .",
    "the hb evolutionary tracks employed in the present project are the same as described in catelan et al .",

    "consistent with our working hypothesis that age is the sole second parameter , we assume that m5 and pal  4/eridanus have the same chemical composition .",
    "we have assumed throughout this paper that the hb morphology of the studied gcs can be reproduced by unimodal gaussian deviates in zahb mass ( see catelan et al .",
    "1998 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a relevant numerical improvement is the adoption of hill s ( 1982 ) interpolation algorithm also to interpolate among the evolutionary tracks of different masses in order to infer the physical parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 of the  stars \" in the hb simulations .",
    "the synthetic hbs were converted to the observational planes using the prescriptions provided by vandenberg ( 1999b ) .",
    "synthetic hbs have been computed aiming at estimating the optimum parameters @xmath28 ( mean mass ) and @xmath29 ( mass dispersion ) required to reproduce the observed hb morphology parameters for m5 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the adopted procedure is completely analogous to that employed by catelan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we have computed synthetic hbs assuming an overall number of hb stars @xmath30 , as in sandquist s ( 1998 ) sample . for each ( @xmath28 ,  @xmath29 ) combination",
    ", we computed a series of 100 monte carlo simulations and obtained hb morphology parameters therefrom .",
    "after many such trials varying the above two free parameters , we have converged on a set of models characterized by the following values :    @xmath31    such a combination leads to the mean hb morphology parameters described in table  2 ( where the numbers in parentheses represent the standard deviation of the mean over the set of 100 simulations with 553  stars \" in each ) .",
    "note the nice agreement between the observed ( table  1 ) and theoretical ( table  2 ) parameters , to within the errors .",
    "it should be remarked that , if buonanno s ( 1993 ) parameter were bluer ( implying a higher reddening ; cf .",
    " 2.1 ) , our simulations indicate that it would have been easier to account for the overall ratio between blue stars and rr lyrae variables . indeed , schlegel et al .",

    "the @xmath28 value would not differ significantly from the one quoted above though .    0.25 in 0.25 in    it follows that the above @xmath28 value for m5 is a quite robust result for the assumed chemical composition and theoretical framework .",
    "in figure  2 , we plot two synthetic hb / upper rgb models for m5 , picked at random from the pool of 100 simulations .",
    "the plus signs indicate rr lyrae variables ( a strip width of 0.075 in @xmath27 has been assumed ) .",

    "( 1996 ) .      to model the hbs of the extreme outer - halo clusters pal  4 and eridanus",
    "is a significantly more complicated and challenging task than to model that of m5 , given the small number of hb stars detected in the hst studies and the total lack of hb stars lying blueward of the red hb .    after trying a few different possibilities",
    ", we decided to adopt the following approach .",
    "starting with a mass distribution which , in the mean , would give roughly the same number of stars on the red hb and inside the instability strip , we ran many _",
    "sets _ of ( twelve ) synthetic hb simulations , increasing the mean mass by 0.01  @xmath33 from one set to the next , and holding the mass dispersion ( as well as the total number of hb stars25 ) fixed ( at @xmath34 ) in all cases .",
    "the mean mass range covered by our simulations was the following : @xmath35 .",
    "again , random scatter was added following robertson ( 1974 ) . here , however , we did make an effort to reproduce ( approximately ) the errors in the hst photometry ( stetson 1999 ) around the hb level . upon inspection of each of the plots",
    "thus produced , and paying particular attention to their corresponding color distributions in comparison to that shown in figure  1 , we reached the conclusion that the following parameters provide an adequate match to both the pal  4 and the eridanus hst cmds at the hb level :    @xmath36    plots containing the simulations for this case can be found in figure  3 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines , as in figure  1 , indicate the color @xmath37  mag .",
    "notice that in some cases even the  bright \" red hb stars found ( especially ) in the eridanus hst cmd are well reproduced .",
    "we interpret these stars as being the result of evolution away from the zahb towards the asymptotic giant branch , combined with statistical fluctuations due to the small sample size .    0.1 in    0.25 in    0.25 in    0.25 in    the reddening values from schlegel et al .",

    "( 1998 ) ; and    @xmath41    from harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "the transformation between @xmath42 and @xmath43 was carried out adopting a ratio of @xmath44 between the two ( see stetson et al .",
    "1999 ) . as is apparent",
    ", the difference in @xmath43 values between the two sources is smaller in the case of eridanus .    this uncertainty in the @xmath43 value for",
    "pal  4 may affect the choice of model for the red - hb clusters .",
    "the larger reddening from schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) implies an intrinsically _ bluer _ hb distribution than what would be inferred from harris ( 1996 ) .    because of possible systematic uncertainties in @xmath43 and in the color transformations , we show , in figures  4 and 5 , synthetic hbs similar to those displayed in figure  3 , but varying @xmath28 by @xmath45 ( fig .  4 ) and @xmath46 ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "the latter case might be considered more appropriate if the canonical reddening value from harris ( 1996 ) were adopted  implying larger relative ages with respect to m5 ( see below ) .",
    "inspection of figures  4 and 5 shows that statistical fluctuations can also play a role  though it appears more likely that this would lead to a larger @xmath28 for pal  4/eridanus . indeed , more of the models with larger @xmath28 ( fig .  5 )",
    "resemble those in figure  3 in terms of @xmath47 than is the case for models with smaller @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "this is because of the decreasing dependence of hb temperature / color on stellar mass towards the red end of the hb .",
    "thus , if important , statistical fluctuations would tend to lead to an underestimate of the age difference between m5 and pal  4/eridanus , as derived from hb morphology arguments .",
    "a set of 700 synthetic hb computations shows that changing @xmath29 from @xmath48 to @xmath49 leads to a change in mean hb color equivalent to a reddening error by @xmath50  mag , holding @xmath28 fixed at @xmath51 .",
    "had a larger , ",
    "m5-like \" @xmath29 value been adopted , we would have been forced to adopt a slightly larger @xmath28 for pal  4/eridanus .",
    "it is easy to see why : for a given @xmath28 , the low - mass tail of the distributions gets closer and closer to the instability strip region with increasing @xmath29 .",
    "this must be compensated for by increasing @xmath28 , also implying a ( slightly ) larger age difference between pal  4/eridanus and m5 than reported in the next sections .",
    "however , we have been unable to obtain as satisfactory matches to the hbs of pal  4/eridanus using the larger @xmath29 , possibly pointing to a real difference in the mass dispersion among these systems .",
    "in order to estimate the relative ages required to produce the relative hb types of m5 and pal  4/eridanus , we follow a similar approach as described in previous papers of this series ( e.g. , catelan & de freitas pacheco 1995 ) . the main difference here is that we shall evaluate _ the effects of an age - dependent mass loss on the rgb _ , as implied by the several different analytical formulae discussed in the appendix , upon the relative ages thus estimated .",
    "rgb mass loss is estimated on the basis of the rgb models of vandenberg et al .",

    "it is important to note that the vandenberg et al .",
    "results for both the rgb and hb phases are in very good agreement with those from a.  v.  sweigart ( see vandenberg et al . for a discussion ) .    from the vandenberg",
    "( 2000 ) models , we first obtained the age ",
    "rgb tip mass ( @xmath54 ) relationship for the adopted chemical composition .",
    "then we obtained the age  overall mass loss on the rgb ( @xmath55 ) relationship from the appendix .",
    "the required estimate of @xmath56 values was then accomplished by evaluating , for each given ( assumed ) age for m5 ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",
    "holding the @xmath56 value thus derived fixed , the age that leads to a good fit to the pal  4/eridanus hb morphology ( as characterized by the mean hb mass value described in the previous section ) was easily obtained from the @xmath54age and @xmath55age relationships .",
    "hill s ( 1982 ) algorithm was used for the interpolations that defined such relationships . the implied age difference between m5 and pal",
    "4/eridanus followed immediately from this .",
    "table  3 shows our derived @xmath56 values and ages for pal  4/eridanus for each assumed age for m5 and for each of the mass loss formulae discussed in the appendix , including reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) widely adopted one .",
    "the inferred age differences are also listed .",
    "figure  6 summarizes our results ; the hatched regions indicate the relative ages favored by the hst analyses of stetson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and vandenberg ( 1999a ) .    from table  3 and",
    "figure  6 , it is clear that only for extremely low ages@xmath59  gyr  can one reproduce the relative hb types of m5 and pal  4/eridanus in terms of  age as the second parameter , \" even by assuming several different possibilities for the form of an age - dependent mass loss formula for giant stars .",
    "equation  ( a2 ) is the one which leads to the smaller age differences from hb morphology arguments . except for equation  ( a3 ) , reimers ( 1975a , 1975b ) is the one from which the largest relative ages are inferred .",
    "note that only the _",
    "upper limits _ on the possible age difference range estimated by stetson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) are reached for m5 ages of about 9  gyr .",
    "gyr was adopted , whereas an absolute age @xmath60  gyr would lead to even smaller relative turnoff ages . in other words ,",
    "what we show as perfectly horizontal hatched areas in figure  6 should actually be somewhat slanted , with the relative turnoff ages decreasing with decreasing m5 age  thereby making it even harder for the relative ages derived from hb morphology arguments to match the relative turnoff ages obtained from deep hst photometry , even for very low absolute ages . ]",
    "vandenberg s ( 1999a ) results are not reproduced at all ; extrapolation of the curves shown in figure  6 suggests that an m5 age @xmath61  gyr would be required to match the relative ages derived by vandenberg .",
    "the situation would become somewhat less critical if the synthetic hbs shown in figure  4 were adopted for pal  4/eridanus , as shown in figure  7 .",
    "absolute ages for m5 of @xmath60  gyr would be required in this case , and it might be possible to achieve agreement with vandenberg s ( 1999a ) results for an m5 age of @xmath59 gyr . however , the opposite holds if the synthetic hbs displayed in figure  5 are adopted instead , as one can see from figure  8 .",
    "we recall , from the arguments in the previous section , that the models in figure  5 might be the better alternative to those in figure  3 as genuinely representing pal  4/eridanus , if one were to adopt the canonical reddening values from harris ( 1996 ) or if statistical fluctuation effects are important .    in summary",
    ", we conclude that the requirement of extremely low ages , @xmath62  gyr , for all gcs under consideration is a very firm result of the present investigation .",
    "as far as the second - parameter phenomenon goes , we have demonstrated that age can not be the _ only _ second parameter at play , unless one is willing to accept that the ages of m5-like gcs are less than 10  gyr .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in previous papers of this series ( catelan & de freitas pacheco 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ; see also ferraro et al .",
    "1997b ) but , in the present study , we have fully taken into account the effects of an age - dependent mass loss on the rgb .    if the [ @xmath63/fe ] ratio in pal  4/eridanus is lower than commonly found among gcs ( carney 1996 ) , resembling instead the cases of the  young , \" loose gcs ruprecht  106 and pal  12 ( brown , wallerstein , & zucker 1997)a hypothesis which is perhaps not unlikely , since all these clusters may have partaken a common origin ( majewski 1994 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1995 ; lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995)the  turnoff age difference \" between m5 and pal  4/eridanus would _ decrease _ , as inferred from isochrone fits to the hst data ( stetson et al .",
    "1999 ) . on the other hand , the  hb morphology age difference \" would _ increase _ significantly , as inferred from the relative hb types of pal  4/eridanus vs. m5 , because the red hbs of pal  4/eridanus would require a further decrease in the ages needed to match their hbs than derived in the present paper , due to their lower overall [ m / h ] .",
    "we note that proper - motion studies indicate that m5 too is an _",
    "outer - halo _ gc , which just happens to lie close to its perigalacticon ( cudworth 1997 and references therein ) . according to such work , m5 actually spends much of its time at galactocentric distances larger than @xmath64  kpc .",
    "therefore , we should keep in mind that , when using m5 to compare its age against those of ( other ) outer - halo gcs , we may simply be measuring the age dispersion in the outer galactic halo , and not the age difference between the inner and the ( extreme ) outer halo  contrary to what is often assumed .",

    "we note , however , that reimers is by no means the only mass loss formula available for this type of study .",
    "in particular , alternative formulae have been presented by mullan ( 1978 ) , goldberg ( 1979 ) , and judge & stencel ( 1991 , hereafter js91 ) .",
    "we have undertaken a revision of all these formulae , employing the latest and most extensive dataset available in the literature  namely , that of js91 .",

    "_ intrinsic _ scatter among mass loss rates on the rgb is expected to be present ( e.g. , dupree & reimers 1987 ; rood et al . 1997 ; and references therein ) . the origin of such scatter , inferred from the cmds of gcs ( e.g. , rood 1973 ; renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) , is currently unknown ;    \\6 . according to willson ( 1999 ) ,",
    " correlations between observed mass loss rates and physical parameters of cool stars may be ( and usually are ) dominated by selection effects .",
    "most observations have been interpreted using models that are relatively simple ( stationary , polytropic , spherically symmetric , homogeneous ) and thus ` observed ' mass loss rates or limits may be in error by orders of magnitude in some cases . \"",
    "she further claims that ",
    "reimers relation tells us the properties of stars that are losing mass , and _ not _ the mass loss rate that arises from a certain set of stellar parameters .",
    "it has been widely misunderstood and widely misused in stellar evolution and stellar population studies \" ;    \\7 .",
    "the two first - ascent giants analyzed by robinson , carpenter , & brown ( 1998 ) using hst - ghrs , @xmath63  tau and @xmath81  dra , appear to both lie about one order of magnitude below the relations that best fit the js91 data  two orders of magnitude in fact , if compared to reimers formula ( see fig .",
    "the k supergiant @xmath82  vel , analyzed by the same group ( mullan , carpenter , & robinson 1998 ) , appears in much better agreement with the adopted dataset and best fitting relations .",
    "_ in effect , mass loss on the rgb is an excellent , but virtually untested , second - parameter candidate .",
    "_ it may be connected to gc density , rotational velocities , and abundance anomalies on the rgb .",
    "it will be extremely important to study mass loss in first - ascent , low - metallicity giants_in the field and in gcs alike_using the most adequate ground- and space - based facilities available , or expected to become available , in the course of the next decade .",
    "moreover , in order to properly determine how ( mean ) mass loss behaves as a function of the fundamental physical parameters and metallicity , astrometric missions much more accurate than hipparcos , such as sim and gaia , will certainly be necessary .      in this sense , the latest rgb evolutionary tracks by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were employed in an investigation of the amount of mass lost on the rgb and its dependence on age . as in some previous work ( e.g. , dcruz et al .",
    "1996 ) , the effects of mass loss upon rgb evolution were ignored , which is a good approximation except for those stars which lose a considerable fraction of their mass during their evolution up the rgb ( e.g. , castellani & castellani 1993 ) .    in figure",
