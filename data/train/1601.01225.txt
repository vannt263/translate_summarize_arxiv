    "in a recent paper ( * ? ? ? * ; hereafter ) we have introduced a new non - parametric approach to the detection of periodicities in sparse datasets .",
    "the new approach follows the logic of string - length techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and quantifies the dependence between consecutive phase - folded samples , for every trial period . in",
    "we have shown that usually the classical string - length techniques effectively test solely for linear dependence between consecutive samples .",
    "on the other hand , the hoeffding - test approach we have presented there , tests for general dependencies , not necessarily linear . showed that for two kinds of periodic signals ( sawtooth signal and eccentric spectroscopic binary ( sb ) radial - velocity ( rv ) curve ) , our proposed new approach performed better than the conventional techniques .",
    "inspired by the successful simulations presented in , we embarked on a wider study to come up with new and improved periodicity metrics , similarly based on dependence measures .",
    "the current letter represents a first step in that direction , a step we have already alluded to in the discussion of .",
    "section [ bkr ] describes the details of the modification we propose to the hoeffding test , section [ performance ] presents the simulations we have performed in order to test its performance , and in section [ hipparcos ] we show a test of our new metric on real - life data . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our findings .",
    "the best performing method in was based on the hoeffding test .",
    "wassily hoeffding first proposed it in 1948 @xcite as a test of independence between two random variables .",
    "essentially it estimates a measure of deviation of the joint empirical distribution function from a distribution that assumes independence .",
    "the measure of deviation that hoeffding used was the so - called cramr ",
    "von mises criterion for distance between distributions @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 the cumulative distribution functions of the two random variables , and by @xmath2 their joint cumulative distribution function .",
    "then , independence of the two variables would mean @xmath3 .",
    "applying cramr ",
    "von mises criterion for distance between distributions , hoeffding defined his namesake statistic @xmath4 by : @xmath5    in estimating @xmath4 using the emprirical data , we use the empirical distribution functions , determined only by the observed values .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov philosophy , which is popular among astronomers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the above definition eventually results in the formulae presented in .",
    "@xcite introduced a new version of the hoeffding test .",
    "they showed that the two tests were equivalent in large samples , but the new test was easier to compute , and also more naturally amenable to generalization to more than two variables .",
    "the fundamental definition of their statistic is : @xmath6 while the difference seems to be minute and maybe even insignificant , the change in the resulting computing formula is not negligible .    following ,",
    "let us denote the phase - folded data by @xmath7  ( @xmath8 ) where the index @xmath9 reflects the order after the phase folding .",
    "in order to make sure our calculations are not affected by the arbitrary zero - phase choice , we also define @xmath10 .",
    "let us further denote by @xmath11 the phase - folded rank values , such that @xmath12 means that @xmath7 is the smallest value .",
    "let us also define the bivariate rank @xmath13 , as the number of pairs @xmath14 for which both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "note that the existence of the pair @xmath17 accounts for the cyclic wraparound and renders the whole procedure independent of the arbitrary choice of phase .",
    "now we can define our dependence measure by the formula : @xmath18 which can easily be derived from eq .",
    "( 5.2 ) in @xcite .",
    "the above expression is clearly much simpler than the parallel expressions in eqs .",
    "following the same path as in , we performed simulations in which we randomly drew a sparse set of sampling times , from a total baseline spanning @xmath19 time units ( days )",
    ". then we used those times to sample some periodic function with a period of two days , and added white gaussian noise with a prescribed signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "we tested the same set of six periodic functions we tested in : sinusoidal , almost sinusoidal , sawtooth , pulse wave , eclipsing - binary light curve and eccentric sb rv curve .    unlike the approach we followed in",
    ", we have decided this time to use a much simpler and intuitive performance measure : in each tested configuration of signal shape , @xmath20 and snr , we simply counted the number of simulations in which the best score was attained exactly in the correct known period , thus obtainaing the detection fraction. we calculated the periodicity metrics for a frequency grid that spanned the range @xmath21@xmath22 , with steps of @xmath23 .",
    "thus , counting the fraction of cases with the correct period actualy meant a frequency error which was smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "we compared the performance of this blum - kiefer - rosenblatt - test ( bkr ) periodicity metric to the hoeffding - test metric we had introduced in , and also to the two traditional techniques of generalized lomb - scargle @xcite and von - neumann ratio @xcite as a representative of the string - length techniques @xcite .",
    "[ snr_3 ] examines the dependence of the detection performance on the number of samples in the time series , for low - snr .",
    "we held the snr fixed at @xmath24 while we varied the sample size @xmath20 .",
    "the main feature apparent from examining the figure is that the new bkr approach constitutes an improvement over the hoeffding - test approach we introduced in . in cases",
    "where the traditional techniques performed better ( e.g. , pulse - wave signal shape ) , they usually performed also better than bkr , and vice versa .    .",
