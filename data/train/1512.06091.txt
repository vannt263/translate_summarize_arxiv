    "atlas and cms recently announced tantalizing hints of a new resonance with mass @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "the excess is in the diphoton channel , suggesting a spin-@xmath9 resonance , which is the possibility we will pursue in this paper .    a new scalar or pseudoscalar @xmath0 ( which , for convenience , we call the @xmath0-cion ) would fit in nicely with scenarios beyond the standard model ( sm ) , including those which address the hierarchy problem .",
    "several such explanations have already appeared after the collaborations announced their results @xcite-@xcite . however , in the absence of more evidence which allows us to lock into a specific model , a pragmatic way to proceed is to use effective field theory ( eft ) to parametrize our ignorance .",
    "this is the path taken in @xcite , for example .",
    "within such a framework , it becomes possible to investigate the electroweak couplings of @xmath0 to sm particles and propose searches in various channels .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to point out that additional information can be gathered from the search for signals related to vector boson and @xmath0-cion associated production (  @xmath0-strahlung \" ) .",
    "constraints in all possible channels from run i and the current run of the lhc are taken into account .",
    "we find that searching for the resonance in events containing hard photons , leptons and missing energy in the channels @xmath10 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 might reveal new excesses with the current accumulated data already . denoting the scale where new physics is introduced in the eft of @xmath0 and sm gauge bosons by @xmath5 , we estimate that the 13 tev lhc can probe @xmath5 up to 9 tev with 300 fb@xmath6 of data in all those channels . with the current integrated luminosity of @xmath11 fb@xmath6 , @xmath12 tev may be probed already with a few @xmath10 events lurking in the data .",
    "our work is model independent in two senses : first , the proposed channels do not involve gluon - fusion , but quark initiated processes through couplings to the sm @xmath13 , @xmath14 and photon ; second , the scalar couples to the sm gauge bosons via dimension-5 effective operators that respect the sm gauge symmetries .",
    "thus , the results presented in this work would apply to any model where a new 750 gev scalar couples to sm gauge bosons and fits the diphoton excess . as a concrete example",
    ", we examine models with heavy vector - like quarks and leptons coupling to a cp - even scalar . we found that depending on the fermions multiplicities , electric charges and color representation , signals as the ones proposed in this work can be observed at the lhc from 30 to 3000 fb @xmath6 , thus confirming the usefulness of the eft description .    )",

    "<S> the resonance @xmath0 at @xmath1 gev in the diphoton channel observed by atlas and cms , if it holds up , is almost certainly the ( @xmath0)cion of a larger dynasty in a uv completion that may very well be connected to the hierarchy problem . at this stage , however , an effective field theory framework provides a useful way to parametrize searches for this resonance in other channels . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the excess is due to a new scalar or pseudoscalar boson , we study associated production of @xmath0 (  @xmath0-strahlung \" ) at the lhc and propose searches in several clean channels like @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to probe dimension-5 operators coupling @xmath0 to standard model gauge bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a range of widths for @xmath0 , from 5 gev to 45 gev , and find that the three channels probe complementary regions of parameter space and the suppression scale @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the finding of most immediate relevance is that with 3 fb@xmath6 , the lhc might already reveal new excesses in the @xmath2 channel and a 5(3 ) @xmath7 discovery may already be possible after collecting 65(25 ) fb@xmath6 of data with @xmath4 events if the scale of the new physics is within @xmath8 9 tev for couplings respecting 8 tev lhc bounds and compatible with the observed excess in diphotons for a wide resonance as suggested by the atlas collaboration . beyond the eft parametrization , we found realizations of models with heavy vector - like quarks and leptons which can simultaneously fit the diphoton excess and be discovered in the channels proposed here .    diphoton excess , scalar resonance , effective couplings , vector - like quarks and leptons </S>"
