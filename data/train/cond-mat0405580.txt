    "recent experiments on loading bose - einstein condensates into an optical lattice have allowed for the creation and study of strongly correlated systems of atoms  @xcite .",
    "in particular the superfluid ( sf ) to mott insulating ( mi ) transition first observed in a seminal experiment by greiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite has received a lot of attention since it impressively demonstrated a clean realization of the bose - hubbard model ( bhm )  @xcite which has long been considered a toy model in condensed matter physics .",
    "furthermore , in the ideal mi state each atom is localized to a lattice site corresponding to a commensurate filling of the optical lattice with zero - particle - number fluctuations .",
    "these properties make mi states attractive candidates for several applications , most notably quantum memory , quantum computing  @xcite , and quantum simulations of many - body quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the bhm hamiltonian describes atoms loaded into a sufficiently deep optical lattice  @xcite .",
    "it contains a kinetic energy term , with matrix element @xmath0 , describing the hopping of particles from one site to the next and an interaction term , with matrix element @xmath1 , which accounts for the repulsion of two atoms occupying the same site .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 increases with the depth of the optical lattice and can be varied over several orders of magnitude by tuning the optical lattice parameters  @xcite .",
    "in particular by changing the intensity of the laser beams creating the optical lattice it is possible to vary @xmath0 and @xmath1 on time scales much smaller than the decoherence time of the system .",
    "this opens up the possibility of directly studying the dynamics of the bhm during the quantum phase transition at temperature @xmath3  @xcite . according to mean - field ( mf ) theory",
    "this phase transition occurs at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of nearest - neighbor sites in the lattice  @xcite and is easily accessible in an optical lattice .    in  @xcite the dynamics of atoms in a three dimensional ( 3d ) optical lattice ( @xmath6 )",
    "was studied while more recently optical lattice setups where the motion of the atoms was restricted to 1d ( @xmath7 )  @xcite were investigated .",
    "these experiments revealed some striking properties of the quantum phase transition .",
    "in particular a feature which is yet to be fully understood is the time scale over which coherence is built up throughout the atomic system when going from the mi to the sf limit  @xcite .",
    "indeed it can not be easily explained using mf theory and numerical studies of this dynamical effect were , until now , limited to small systems of approximately ten atoms .",
    "recently , however , it has been shown that quantum computations on 1d systems of qubits which do not give rise to strong entanglement can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer via the so called time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "an immediate application of this discovery is to the simulation of the time evolution of many - body 1d quantum systems which are governed by a nearest - neighbor hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the bhm is one of many important model hamiltonians which fall into this class  @xcite .",
    "the simulation method is efficient for all such 1d model hamiltonians due to a universal property of 1d systems that their ground state and lowest - lying excitations tend to contain only a small amount of entanglement  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to the 1d bhm with our physical motivation being to study the the nature and speed at which the superfluid component is built up as the system is dynamically driven through the sf - mi transition . by exploiting the efficient scaling of the tebd algorithm with the size of the system",
    "we are able to investigate this phenomenon for setups which are of comparable size to those studied in experiments  @xcite .",
    "first , in sec .  [ model ] , we introduce the 1d bhm for describing atoms in optical lattices and briefly introduce the tebd algorithm as used in this paper . in sec .",
    "[ groundstates ] we then demonstrate the applicability of the tebd to the bhm by comparison with exact numerical calculations for small systems .",
    "this is then followed by an investigation of sf and mi ground states of larger lattice setups concentrating on their spatial correlations and occupation number fluctuations together with a comparison to mf results .",
    "we then study the dynamics of the mi to sf transition in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ] when changing the lattice depth on two different time scales .",
    "most notably for rapid mi to sf ramping we find that the width of the central interference peak , as observed after releasing the atoms from the lattice , shrinks with an increasing total ramping time with the same functional dependence found in  @xcite .",
    "this result is discussed in sec .",
    "[ dynamics ]  b. finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the bhm describing bosonic atoms in an optical lattice where the motion is restricted to 1d and give a short overview of the numerical method used in our simulations .      by confining an ultracold bosonic gas in a 3d optical lattice with a large depth in the two orthogonal directions @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath5 it is possible to create an array of effective 1d systems in the @xmath9 direction  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of these systems is governed by the external trapping and the optical lattice potential along the @xmath9 axis .",
    "the optical lattice then has a depth @xmath10 proportional to the laser intensity and a lattice period @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the wavelength of the laser light .",
    "the hamiltonian describing each 1d system reduces to the 1d bhm ( for details see appendix [ 1dol ] )  @xcite ( taking @xmath13 throughout ) : @xmath14 where the operators @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are bosonic destruction ( creation ) operators for a bosonic particle in site @xmath17 , centered at @xmath18 , obeying the standard canonical commutation relations .",
    "the grand canonical hamiltonian then has @xmath19 as the local chemical potential for site @xmath17 , where @xmath20 is the external trapping potential .",
    "the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be determined in terms of the wannier functions @xmath21 as shown in appendix [ 1dol ] and under the assumptions outlined are independent of the lattice site @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "their ratio can be varied over a wide range by dynamically changing the depth @xmath10 of the optical lattice .",
    "for all the systems considered here we take the wavelength of the light used to form the optical lattice as @xmath22  nm and the atomic species trapped as @xmath23rb , where @xmath24  nm .      in this paper",
    "we exploit the recently devised tebd simulation algorithm  @xcite which allows the dynamics of 1d systems with nearest - neighbor interactions , such as the bhm , to be computed accurately and efficiently .",
    "the tebd algorithm has been shown to be closely related to the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "over the past decade the dmrg has provided enormous insight into the static and dynamic equilibrium properties of 1d systems .",
    "although originally devised as a ground - state method , it has been extended to yield accurate low - energy spectra  @xcite , and also to calculations of the real time evolution of 1d systems  @xcite which is of particular importance here .",
    "the approach of  @xcite is to take the dmrg ground state @xmath25 obtained for the initial hamiltonian and use it to define a decimation of the hilbert space in which the schrdinger equation is numerically integrated .",
    "the key assumption , and most severe approximation , within this scheme is that this static subspace defined by @xmath25 is adequate to approximate @xmath26 with reasonable accuracy for all times . in general this",
    "will only be true for short periods of time .",
    "novel methods have been devised  @xcite which can maintain the accuracy over longer periods by ` targeting ' other states in addition to the ground state , but in doing so the efficiency of the computation is significantly reduced  @xcite .",
    "in contrast the tebd algorithm can maintain typical dmrg accuracies while remaining efficient . despite their differing origins",
    "it has recently been shown that tebd and dmrg algorithms share some crucial conceptual and formal similarities  @xcite . indeed both methods search for an approximation to the true wave function within a restricted class of wave functions which are described by matrix product states  @xcite , and",
    "do so with identical decomposition and truncation procedures",
    ". the essential difference , which we shall emphasize shortly , is that the tebd algorithm updates the matrix product decomposition directly and in such a way that the resulting decimated subspace in which the time evolution is computed is optimally adapted at each step  @xcite .",
    "here we briefly outline the essential features of the tebd algorithm , with specific attention to its application to the bhm .",
    "let us consider a 1d bhm composed of @xmath27 sites .",
    "an arbitrary state of this system can be expanded in the fock basis @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the fock state of @xmath30 particles in site @xmath17 . for the purpose of simulating this system the number of fock basis states per lattice site",
    "must be cut off to some upper limit @xmath31 . in all the numerical calculations we performed @xmath32 .",
    "this is sufficient to avoid any cut off effects in the bosonic occupation , as long as only small filling factors of the lattice are used and the on - site interaction energy @xmath1 is sufficiently large compared to the hopping energy @xmath0 .",
    "now suppose we split the system into two contiguous parts @xmath33 composed of the first @xmath17 sites and @xmath34 composed of the last @xmath35 sites .",
    "we can think of this partitioning as cutting the @xmath17 th bond situated between sites @xmath17 and @xmath36 . for any state @xmath37 a schmidt decomposition ( sd )",
    "can be performed which renders the state in the form @xmath38}{\\left| \\phi_{\\alpha}^{a_m } \\right\\rangle}{\\left| \\phi_{\\alpha}^{b_m } \\right\\rangle},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the schmidt rank of the sd , @xmath40}$ ] are the schmidt coefficients , and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , are the corresponding schmidt states of the respective subsystems .",
    "the schmidt rank @xmath39 is a useful measure of the entanglement between the two subsystems @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite . given any state @xmath37 a set of @xmath43 sd",
    "can be performed according to a sequence of such partitions of the system with @xmath44 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ chidiagrams](a ) .     and @xmath45 tensors .",

    "specifically one finds @xmath49n_1}\\lambda_{\\alpha_1}^{[1]}\\gamma_{\\alpha_1 \\alpha_2}^{[2]n_2}\\lambda_{\\alpha_2}^{[2 ] } \\cdots \\lambda_{\\alpha_{m-1}}^{[m-1 ] } \\gamma_{\\alpha_m}^{[1]n_m } , \\label{chiexp}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the occupation number of site @xmath17 , and @xmath50 are the schmidt indices of the @xmath17 th partition , each of which sums from 1 to its respective schmidt rank @xmath39 . with reference to fig .",
    "[ chidiagrams](b ) we note that each @xmath51}$ ] is labeled by the bond between sites @xmath17 and @xmath36 , along with the corresponding schmidt index @xmath50 , whereas each @xmath52n_m}$ ] is labeled by a site @xmath17 which resides between the two bonds @xmath53 and @xmath17 , and so also possess the schmidt indices @xmath54 and @xmath50 of these bonds .    under the circumstances described the expansion , eq .",
    "( [ chiexp ] ) , is exact and as such the number of parameters stored could grow exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "however , it is a general feature of 1d systems with nearest - neighbor interactions that the entanglement within their ground state and low - lying excitations depends weakly on the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "indeed it can be shown that the entanglement of a block of size @xmath55 with the rest of the system remains finite as @xmath56 in 1d systems or at worst grows logarithmically with @xmath55 at criticality  @xcite .",
    "consequently the entanglement between the blocks of any of the @xmath43 sd illustrated in fig .",
    "[ chidiagrams](a ) can be saturated by some fixed schmidt rank , which for the systems we consider is typically small .",
    "it is this fact that accounts for the success of dmrg in 1d systems . similarly within tebd",
    "it allows the maximum possible schmidt rank used in the matrix product decomposition , eq .",
    "( [ chiexp ] ) , to be fixed to some value @xmath57 , thereby truncating it to the most significant contributions . for an appropriate choice of @xmath57",
    "this approximation will be accurate with the error proportional to the sum of the discarded eigenvalues in the sd  @xcite . this clear interpretation of the central numerical parameter @xmath57 within tebd is very useful .",
    "once a value of @xmath57 is found to saturate the entanglement of the ground state and low - lying excitations of a system then this a direct measure of the role of entanglement in the dynamics of the system . in total",
    "the scaling in the number of parameters within the expansion , eq .",
    "( [ chiexp ] ) , is quadratic in @xmath57 and linear in the size of the system @xmath27 and in @xmath31 .",
    "so upon fixing @xmath57 and thus preventing its possible exponential dependence on @xmath27 , the description becomes efficient . as with dmrg",
    "this decomposition of a state generates , for all practical purposes , an optimal @xmath58 matrix product state  @xcite .",
    "a noteworthy limit of this is the approximation is where @xmath59 , which forces the description of the system to be of product form with respects to all sites .",
    "using the tebd algorithm under this severe restriction is in fact equivalent to mf theory and the gutzwiller ansatz @xcite .",
    "another crucial advantage of the tebd algorithm is that once a state is expressed in the matrix product form , eq .",
    "( [ chiexp ] ) , one- and two - site unitary transformations can be applied directly and exactly to the system such that the resulting state can be efficiently returned to a matrix product form  @xcite .",
    "indeed , given a partitioning of the system into a two - block - two - site configuration @xmath60[m \\quad m+1][m+2 \\cdots m]$ ] , the application of a two - site unitary to sites @xmath17 and @xmath36 only requires updates to be performed on the tensors _ local _ to those sites ",
    "namely , @xmath61n_m}\\lambda_{\\alpha_m}^{[m]}\\gamma_{\\alpha_m \\alpha_{m+1}}^{[m+1]n_{m+1}}$ ] .",
    "the major computational effort of this update is limited to the rediagonalization of the reduced density matrix of one of the adjacent site and block subsystems , such as sites @xmath62[m+2 \\cdots m]$ ] , which is of dimension @xmath63 at most  @xcite . the crucial feature here is that a dmrg - style truncation to only the most relevant eigenstates of this reduced density matrix occurs in an optimal way at each application of a two - site unitary .",
    "this is in contrast with time - dependent dmrg methods where the basis states which make up the matrix product decomposition are fixed at the start  @xcite . the number of basic operations required to perform this update scales as _",
    "o_@xmath64  @xcite .    to compute the action of the time - evolution unitary @xmath65 , for a time step @xmath66",
    ", we first make the observation that for hamiltonians with nearest - neighbor interactions , which are composed of two - site operators at most , terms can be separated into a sum of those involving odd sites , @xmath67 , and those involving even sites , @xmath68 : @xmath69 given that no terms within @xmath67 involve the same lattice sites they all commute amongst themselves .",
    "thus the action of @xmath70 can be computed exactly as @xmath71 since each term in this product is a two - site unitary , they can be applied individually to the state with the method detailed in  @xcite , and the same is also true for @xmath68 .",
    "the complications in computing the time evolution arise from the fact that @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not in general commute , and hence we approximate the unitary time - evolution operator @xmath72 using a trotter expansion .",
    "ignoring their noncommutativity would constitute a first - order expansion .",
    "if we define @xmath73 then the second - order expansion follows when @xmath74 . for the numerical simulations performed in this paper",
    "the fourth - order expansion @xcite was used , which has the form @xmath75 where the parameters @xmath76 are defined as @xmath77 a detailed analysis of the errors and computational cost of tebd is given in  @xcite , where it is shown that the trotter error propagates quadratically with the simulated time and so the accuracy of the method can be maintained for long periods with appropriate choices of the parameters .",
    "the pure tebd implementation we employ here can be improved further by combining the advantageous features of tebd outlined with the well - established optimizations of dmrg such as good quantum numbers and white s ` state prediction ' method . in doing",
    "so an adaptive time - dependent dmrg algorithm is obtained  @xcite illustrating the extremely close relationship between these two methods .",
    "finally we note the very recent advances in generalizing tebd and dmrg to describe mixed state dynamics and generic master equation evolution of 1d systems with nearest - neighbor coupling  @xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of simulating finite temperature effects , decoherence and dissipation .",
    "we first investigate the ground state of the bhm and compare the numerical results with the exact ground states for a small homogeneous system .",
    "then we consider a larger system in the presence of a shallow magnetic trap @xmath20 superimposed on the lattice and compare the results to those predicted by mf theory . in all cases the numerical ground state was computed with the tebd algorithm using continuous imaginary time evolution from a simple product state , as detailed in @xcite .      to investigate the accuracy of the numerical simulation and its applicability to the bhm we first consider a small system in which an exact solution can be found readily .",
    "specifically we use an optical lattice composed of @xmath78 sites , a trapping potential of @xmath79 with box boundary conditions , and a total number of particles @xmath80 .",
    "the ground state is then calculated numerically and exactly for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , corresponding to the sf , intermediate , and mi regimes , respectively .",
    "the numerical simulation was performed for @xmath83 and @xmath84 in each case .",
    "the one - particle density matrices @xmath85 obtained for each regime for the numerical and exact calculations are visually indistinguishable in all cases . in order to highlight the extent of the agreement we present a number of other plots . specifically in the sf regime",
    "the comparisons of the spatial correlation of the central site @xmath86 as a function of the distance @xmath87 are shown in fig .",
    "[ plots_2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ plots_2](b ) between the exact and numerical calculations using @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "[ plots_2](d ) and fig .",
    "[ plots_2](e),fig .",

    "these results show that although there is qualitative agreement between exact and @xmath88 calculation , almost all expectation values have a maximum deviation from the exact calculation improved by an order of magnitude with @xmath89 . as expected for a sf ground state the one - particle density matrix spectrum in fig .",
    "[ plots_2](f ) is dominated by one eigenvalue of order @xmath94 .",
    "however , given that the lattice still has a nonzero depth this state deviates from that of a pure sf , where @xmath95 , since the sum of the remaining eigenvalues ( in descending order ) is @xmath96 and so represents a significant quantum depletion of the sf .    for the intermediate and mi regime a similar factor of improvement",
    "can be obtained ; however in this case the @xmath88 calculation already yields excellent agreement with the exact calculation .",
    "specifically we find the infidelity between the numerical and exact many - body state is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is the numerical ( exact ) ground state and the temperature corresponding to the difference in their ground - state energy as @xmath100 nk .",

    "[ plots_6_20 ] .    these plots , along with those where",
    "@xmath89 for the sf regime , illustrate the onset of increasing mi characteristics in the ground states .",
    "in particular the rapidly decreasing spatial correlations and fluctuations in occupancy , as well as the change in the spectrum from being dominated by one single - particle state to having seven almost equally occupied orbitals . these indicate that the mi ground state obtained is a very close approximation to that of a pure mi , where @xmath103 , representing commensurate filling of the lattice .",
    "however given that the lattice is not infinitely deep deviations with this pure mi state exist and are evident from the persistence of small off - diagonal correlations visible at @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ plots_6_20](b ) and the spread of the spectrum about unity in fig .",
    "[ plots_6_20](f ) .",
    "as expected we find that the agreement between the numerical and exact calculations for a given value of @xmath57 improves with increasing @xmath105 in line with the decrease in off - diagonal correlations . in all cases the @xmath106 results gave excellent agreement with the exact calculation . the worst case being in the sf regime where an infidelity of @xmath107 , and a deviation in ground - state energy of @xmath108 nk was obtained .",

    "the average particle number can be fixed to @xmath80 , enabling the comparisons above .",
    "indeed for the calculations performed the worst absolute value of the projection of the simulated state outside the @xmath80 fock subspace was @xmath110 .",
