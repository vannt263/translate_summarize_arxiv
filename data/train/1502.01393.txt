    "two - particle angular correlation is an efficient and powerful tool to study the properties of the underlying physics processes of particle production in different collision systems , like proton - proton or heavy - ion collisions . using identified particles we can check those kind of conservation laws which are related to the different quark and flavour content of the processes  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , on the away side the splitting effect is not really present .",
    "this indicates that in pythia generated particles does not have connection to the choosen trigger particle in this context . from this picture",
    "we can qulitativley say that the strength of the quantum number conservation effects is increasing in the order of charge ( @xmath43 ) , strangeness ( @xmath45 ) and baryon number ( @xmath44 ) respectively .",

    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ] , as well .",
    "a peculiar pattern is present on the near- and away side in the @xmath56 gev / c and @xmath57 gev / c ranges for charged kaons and protons , where the baryon / meson anomaly was observed at rhic and at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "an opposite trend of the splitting at higher transverse momenta can be attributed to the minijet production embedded in the generator .",
    "so far the associated particle spectra were studied in case of wide range of trigger particles momenta . here",
    "we briefly review the @xmath25 dependence of the spectra .",

    "since positively charged triggers were choosen we can introduce the definition below in order to plot these ratios higher than one :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 and @xmath62 denote the unlike - sign and like - sign trigger / associated particle pairs , respectively .",

    "one can observe how the splits  in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio]evolve as a function of @xmath9 in the near side cone .",

    "we can summerize the observed effects as follows : +    * in p - p collisions the effect is present for pions , kaons , and protons in the near side cone and the largest for protons with a factor of @xmath67 effect . * in pb - pb collisions the effect is present for kaons and protons in the near- and away side cones and the largest for protons . * in pb - pb collisions the observed trend of the effect for kaons and protons is completely opposite compared to the situatuion in p - p collisions in the intermediate associated transverse momentum spectra 3 gev / c @xmath68 7 gev / c interval .    in p - p collisions at the away side",
    "the effect is increasing with @xmath42 but the magnitude saturates to a constant value .",
    "a similar , but larger effect is seen in central pb - pb collisions within the @xmath69 gev / c transverse momentum range , where the cronin effect  @xcite and the baryon / meson anomaly act .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:31 ] we plotted the unlike - to - like sign relative yield ratio defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) for pions , kaons , and protons with different collision energies @xmath70 . at the near side ( upper panel of the figure )",
    "one can see a clear dependence of the splitting on @xmath70 as a function of @xmath9 for all particle species . as we go up with @xmath70",
    "the effect shows a decreasing trend .",
    "this can be related to the fact that the higher the collision energy the more the number of hard interactions .",
    "this has effect on the splitting and it is washed out. + on the away side we have no such kind of @xmath70 dependence , which can be expected based on the argument we had in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:32 ] one can see the event multiplicity dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) for pions , kaons , and protons at @xmath4  tev in p - p collisions .",
    "we observe the same kind of trend in the evolution of the splitting with the multiplicity what have been seen in the previous case , since the number of generated particles depends on the collision energy @xmath70 .",
    "this case can be treated as a subset of the previous one , becasue here we fix the @xmath70 and this way the generated number of particles are bouded .",
    "we can conclude that the higher the event multiplicity the smaller the size of the splitting due to increasing underlying event contribution at higher multiplicities .",
    "+ very similar to the case with @xmath70 dependence we state here that the effects on the away side have no obvious dependence with event multiplicity .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:33 ] the centrality dependence of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) is plotted in pb - pb collisions at @xmath71  tev .",
    "we expected here a similar effect such as obtained in the previous subsection due to the fact that the multiplicity is related to centrality . in peripheral collisions ( black symbols , centrality @xmath8 )",
    "we observe a very similar behaviour for pions as we have seen in subsec .",
    "[ subsec:31 ] for the collision energy dependence in p - p collisions . for kaons and protons",
    "there are two major deviations .",
    "firstly , eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) on the near side both for the kaons and protons starts at the same value as for pions , while in fig .",
    "[ fig:31 ] at the same collision energy ( @xmath2  tev ) we see an obvious inverse deviation from unity in the first @xmath9 bin  which has the highest value for protons .",
    "this deviation turns to be greater than @xmath63 , approaching to highest @xmath42 values .",
    "secondly , we do see an inverse evolution too on the away side for kaons and protons . + examining the most central ( red symbols , centrality @xmath6 ) and mid central ( blue symbols , centrality @xmath7 ) events we clearly see a reverse trend up to @xmath65  gev / c , which is attributed to the region of the minijet production .",
    "surprisingly , associated particles on the away side show a stronger effect .",
    "monte carlo studies of two - particle azimuthal correlations have been performed with identified trigger particles and identified associated particles in p - p and pb - pb collisions at mid - rapidity .",
    "the presented analysis aims to suggest a possible measurement of the charge conservation effect via pid - triggered spectra .",
    "we think it would be interesting to see whether measured data behaves similarly as pythia or hijing based monte carlo generated events .",
    "the key issues we have found in our analysis :    * quantum number conservation can be seen in the near side and we have got weak signal on the away side , which suggest the correlations mainly arise from parton cascade and hadronization processes in monte carlo generated data samples . * the effect is getting stronger with multiple quantum number conservation @xmath72 for pions ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath73 for kaons ( @xmath74 ) , and @xmath75 for proton ( @xmath76 ) . * the relative pid - triggered yields defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) , presents increasing splitting up to @xmath77 gev / c and seem saturating at the highest momenta at the near side , however the lack of this effect is observed at the away side in pythia simulated p - p collisions . * in case of hijing - simulated pb - pb collisions this splitting effect is also presents , but inverse trend can be seen in the unlike - to - like relative pid - triggered yield .",
    "this anomalous behavior can be either due to the minijet production or high - energy nuclear effect ( cronin , shadowing / anti - shadowing ) modeled in the hijing monte carlo generator . *",
    "both collision energy and multiplicity dependence of the effect were investigated in p - p in addition to the centrality - dependence simulations in central and peripheral pb - pb collisions .",
    "here high - momenta or low - luminosity events presented larger effect , but this may sensitive to the background subtraction ( here zyam ) or the mixture of the soft - hard regime in monte carlo event generator cocktails .    in summary our aim is to suggest to perform the presented analysis on real data , where either the nature of the correlations or the goodness of the monte carlo generators can be tested .",
