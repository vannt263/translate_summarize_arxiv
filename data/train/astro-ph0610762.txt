    "the topology of large scale structure in the universe is an important physical property of the matter density field that can be compared with the prediction of the simple inflationary models ( guth 1981 ; linde 1983 ) where gaussian random phase initial conditions are generated from quantum fluctuations in the early universe . analytic tools for quantitatively analyzing the topology of large scale structure in three dimensions have been developed during the past 20 years ( gott , melott , & dickinson 1986 ; hamilton , gott , & weinberg 1986 ; gott , weinberg , & melott 1987 , gott et al .",

    "the distribution of galaxies in space is smoothed to construct isodensity contour surfaces whose topology may be computed . our genus statistic  described below  quantifies the topology of isodensity contours .    on smoothing scales larger than the correlation length ,",
    "the fluctuations are still in the linear regime and since fluctuations in the linear regime grow in place without changing topology , the topology we measure now should reflect that of the initial conditions , which should be of gaussian random phase according to the theory of inflation @xcite . we have shown this in detail by comparison with large n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "we expect sponge - like topology at the median density contour to be a strong prediction of inflation ( gott , melott , and dickinson 1986 , gott , weinberg , melott 1987 ) .",
    "previous models of galaxy clustering suggested either a meatball topology ",
    "isolated clusters growing in a low density connected background as suggested by the press and schechter ( 1974 ) formalism or by hierarchical galaxy formation ( peebles 1974 , soneira & peebles 1978)or a swiss cheese topology ",
    "isolated voids surrounded on all sides by walls as suggested by einasto , joeveer , & saar ( 1980 ) .",
    "but with gaussian random phase initial conditions we expect a sponge - like topology as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "studies of many observational samples have been conducted by our group and others , which have shown in _ every _ case a sponge - like median density contour as expected from inflation . for notable examples , see gott , melott , & dickinson ( 1986 ) , gott et al .",

    "the dramatic agreement between the 2d cmb results and the gaussian random phase hypothesis strongly supports idea of the standard theory of inflation and that the initial conditions were truly gaussian random phase .",
    "the three - dimensional topology data on galaxy clustering are particularly interesting because they allow us not only to confirm their general gaussian random phase nature ( on large scales ) , but also to test for non - linear processes and bias involved with galaxy formation . matsubara ( 1994 )",
    "has discussed how the genus curve may be altered by second - order non - linear gravitational clustering effects , which can show up at small smoothing lengths .",
    "vogeley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) explicitly measured the diminution of the genus amplitude caused by these effects .",
    "park , kim , & gott ( 2005 ) have studied other important alterations which can occur by non - linear gravitational evolution , redshift space distortion , and biasing associated with galaxy formation .    in this paper",
    "we compute genus curves for volume - limited samples of the largest galaxy redshift survey to date , the data release 5 ( dr5 ) of the sdss , and for mock samples from state - of - the - art n - body simulations .",
    "our goal is to examine whether the models for galaxy formation represented by these simulations are consistent with the observations .",
    "this is a potentially powerful test , because the input parameters of the flat @xmath4cdm model used in these simulations were determined by fitting to a host of other observations ",
    "cmb anisotropy data , large - scale power spectrum and correlation function of galaxies , sneia luminosity - distance data , cluster abundances and baryon fraction , etc.but not topology of large - scale structure in the galaxy distribution . as the basic underpinnings of the model",
    "become more secure , we can turn to more precise testing of models for the physics of galaxy formation . likewise , the methods and parameters for simulating galaxies have been tuned to match other observations , but not topology .",
    "thus , this comparison provides an independent test of the model for structure formation .",
    "the genus is a measure of the topology of the large scale distribution of galaxies .",
    "we first smooth the point distribution of galaxy positions ( we use only volume - limited samples in the analysis below ) with a gaussian smoothing ball of radius @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath5 is chosen to be greater than or equal to the correlation length . in this paper",
    "we choose @xmath7 mpc which is approximately equal to the galaxy correlation length .",
    "this smallest scale yields the highest resolution measure of the three - dimensional topology and the greatest statistical power because of the large number of resolution elements .",
    "this scale also gives the greatest amount of information about non - linear gravitational effects and biasing involved in galaxy formation .",
    "we establish density contour surfaces labeled by @xmath8 , where the volume fraction on the high density side of the density contour surface is @xmath9 : @xmath10 the genus as a function of @xmath8 is given by @xmath11 ( gott , melott , and dickinson , 1986 ) .",
    "thus , an isolated cluster has a genus of @xmath12 by this definition .",
    "we have shown that @xmath13 is also equal to minus the integral of the gaussian curvature over the area of the contour surface divided by @xmath14 , which enables us to measure the genus with a computer program ( contour 3d ) ( see gott , melott , & dickinson 1986 and gott , weinberg , & melott 1987 ) .    for a gaussian random phase density field , the genus per unit volume , @xmath15 , is given by @xmath16 where the amplitude @xmath17 depends only on the average value of @xmath18 integrated over the smoothed power spectrum ( hamilton , gott , & weinberg 1986 ; adler 1981 ; doroshkevich 1970 ; gott , weinberg , & melott 1987 ) .",
    "thus , the amplitude @xmath19 [ units : @xmath20 can tell us about the primordial power spectrum . for a gaussian random field , the median density contour ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 volume enclosed ) exhibits a sponge - like topology ( many holes and no isolated regions ) ; the @xmath23 high density contour ( @xmath24 ) shows isolated clusters , while the @xmath25 density contour ( @xmath26 ) is dominated by isolated voids .",
    "we call the curves @xmath13 and @xmath27 ( which differ only by a constant factor for a given sample ) the `` genus curves '' .    for the purpose of examining departures of the observed genus curve from the gaussian random phase prediction , we parameterize the genus curve by several derived quantities .",
    "first is the best - fit amplitude , @xmath28 which we measure by least squares fit of the theoretical random phase curve to the data , fitting only in the range @xmath29 . for the random phase case ,",
    "this amplitude is proportional to ( @xmath30 ) of the smoothed power spectrum and so gives information about the primordial power spectrum . for observations , this amplitude appears lower because of non - linear clustering and biasing due to coalescence of structures ( park & gott 1991b ; vogeley et al .",
    "1994 ; canavezes et al . 1998 )    we quantify shifts and deviations of the genus curve from the shape of the random phase curve using the following three variables .",
    "we measure horizontal shifts of the central part of the genus curve with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the genus of the random phase curve following the formula in equation  [ eq : grgenus ] , using the fitted amplitude @xmath19 above .",
    "the theoretical curve ( eq .  [ eq : grgenus ] ) has @xmath33 = 0 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath33 is called a `` meatball shift '' as it is caused by a greater prominence of isolated connected high - density structures which push the genus curve to the left .",
    "a positive value of @xmath33 is called a `` bubble shift '' as it can be caused by a greater prominence of isolated voids , and might be produced by isolated explosions ( ostriker and cowie 1981 ) as opposed to inflation . a slight , statistically significant `` meatball shift '' ( @xmath34 ) was observed first by gott et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who examined the cfa , giovanelli & haynes , and tully datasets . in hindsight",
    ", one can see a slight `` meatball shift '' in the very first genus curve ever measured ( gott , weinberg , melott 1987 ) and this `` meatball shift '' was also seen for brighter galaxies in an analysis of an earlier sample of the sdss ( park et al .",
    "this shift is presumably due to non - linear galaxy clustering and bias associated with galaxy formation .    to quantify departures of the observed genus from the random phase prediction in the region of the genus curve where isolated voids should dominate , we measure @xmath35 where @xmath32 is again the genus of the best fit random phase curve following the formula in equation  [ eq : grgenus ] ( see @xcite for an explanation of the choice of range in @xmath8 ) . as shown in @xcite",
    ", a value of @xmath36 can be the result of biasing in galaxy formation because voids are very empty and can coalesce into a few larger voids .",
    "@xmath37 is sensitive to the number of isolated voids but the density contour ( at @xmath38 for example ) is given by the volume fraction , so if @xmath37 is less than 1 , and by definition there is the same volume in the low density regions being measured , there must therefore be fewer but larger voids .",
    "non - linear clustering alone at these scales predicts a value of @xmath39 for the power spectrum of the @xmath40 model we adopt ( see figure 1 of park , kim , & gott 2005 ) , so observing @xmath36 may be an indication of bias in galaxy formation .",
    "similar to @xmath37 , we measure a quantity @xmath41 that characterizes departure from random phase behavior in the part of the genus curve expected to be sensitive to the number of isolated high - density regions ( clusters ) , @xmath42 a value of @xmath43 may occur because of non - linear clustering , when clusters collide and merge .",
    "also if there is a single large connected structure like the sloan great wall , this can also lower the value of @xmath41 .",
    "also , as park , kim , & gott ( 2005 ) have shown , the matsubara ( 1994 ) formula for second - order gravitational non - linear effects has the result that @xmath44 at all scales , so if we observe both @xmath37 and @xmath41 to be less than 1 , ( as we find below to be the case ) biased galaxy formation must be involved .",
    "before we confront results of current simulations of the flat @xmath4cdm model with the best observations of the topology of the galaxy distribution currently available , it is instructive to consider the remarkable success to date of large n - body simulations in modeling large - scale structure .",
    "it is encouraging that as the volume and resolution in n - body simulations have grown with the size and quality of observational data sets , that the agreement has become even more spectacular  perhaps a sign that we are on the right track with these models .",
    "peebles did the first large n - body simulation for cosmology using 1000 dark matter particles with @xmath45 and poisson initial conditions .",
    "it showed clusters like the coma cluster forming from random fluctuations by gravitational instability and a reasonable covariance function .",
    "aarseth , gott and turner ( 1973 ) used 4,000 particles with initial conditions that had more power on large scales than poisson ( index @xmath46 ) .",
    "they found power law covariance functions quite like those observed even for models with @xmath47 and @xmath46 ( gott , turner , & aarseth 1979 , gott & turner 1979 ) as originally proposed theoretically by gott & rees ( 1975 ) .",
    "( indeed , inflationary flat lambda models popular today have @xmath48 and more power on large scales than poisson initial conditions , just as these early simulations suggested . )",
    "they also found voids as large as those observed .",
    "the largest voids had volumes such that at the mean density they would have contained as much mass as the coma type clusters contained .",
    "this was reasonable from theoretical considerations of non - linear clustering , considering cluster ( gunn and gott 1972 ) and void ( bertschinger 1985 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) formation from small fluctuations via gravitational instability .",
    "in gaussian random phase initial conditions , isolated over- and under - dense regions in the initial conditions should be equal in mass leading to equal mass great clusters and empty voids lacking the same amount of mass .",
    "they also found that such @xmath48 models with more power at large scales than poisson produced better multiplicity functions than @xmath49 poisson models ( gott & turner 1977 ; bhavsar , gott , & aarseth 1981 ) .",
    "the advent of inflation brought for the first time realistic theoretical power spectra to input into n - body models .",
    "together , inflation and cold dark matter specified reasonable initial conditions .",
    "a suite of such simulations by davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) provided an impressive match to many aspects of the observed large - scale structure .",
    "just as theory seemed to be converging on the now - disproven `` standard cdm model , '' the observations provided a shock .",
    "de lapparent , geller & huchra ( 1986 ) found many voids @xmath50 mpc across .",
    "this caused a number of people to abandon gaussian random phase initial conditions and gravitational instability  favoring explosions to produce the voids instead ( ostriker & cowie 1981 ) .",
    "then geller & huchra ( 1989 ) discovered the cfa great wall of galaxies , which surprised everyone .",
    "this result was announced at an iau conference in rio de janeiro .",
    "many people said that was the end for random phase initial conditions , for one expected the covariance function to die at a scale of about @xmath51 mpc and here was a structure that was @xmath52 mpc long .",
    "`` perhaps it was produced by cosmic string wakes , '' was one comment made at the time ( though not by us ) .    however , the jump to abandon random phase initial conditions ignored the fact that no n - body simulations had been done by that time that were large enough to properly model structures as large as the cfa great wall .",
    "when park ( 1990 ) did such simulations using 4 million particles , simulating such a volume for the first time , the results showed that such great walls form routinely .",
    "in fact , a @xmath53 thick slice survey through the simulations was a near perfect visual match to the geller and huchra survey .",
    "these simulations used a standard peak biasing scheme and included both standard cdm and @xmath54 models .",
    "narrow @xmath55 thick slices showed prominent large voids like those in the de lapparent , geller & huchra slice and great walls appeared in @xmath53 thick slices .",
    "this simulation showed weak narrow walls and filaments of galaxies inside the voids , as seen in the cfa data ( park , gott , melott , & karachentsev 1992 ) .    in similar fashion , n - body dark matter simulations",
    "large enough to mimic the deep pencil beam surveys of broadhurst , ellis , koo , & szalay ( 1990 ) showed apparently regular spikes ( walls ) of galaxies just like those observed ( park & gott 1991a ) . and large n - body simulations ( park 1991 ) showed great attractors just like that observed by lynden - bell et al .",
    "great repulsors are not seen because such peaks in the gravitational potential occur in the middle of large voids where there are too few tracer galaxies .",
    "n - body simulations including hydrodynamics have been successful in modeling the lyman alpha forest ( cen , miralda - escude , ostriker , & rauch 1994 ; hernquist , katz , weinberg , & miralda - escude 1996 ) .    prior to this study we did an analysis of the topology of a large n - body computer simulation made to mimic the sloan digital sky survey ( colley et al .",
    "this 54 million particle simulation was observed from one location to simulate what will be seen by the sloan digital sky survey , to produce sky maps , slices , and 3d topology maps , to show the power of the survey .",
    "the sky map looked astonishingly like real sky maps made to similar depth , and the slice maps looked quite like similar survey maps made in the las campanas survey @xcite and now seen in the sdss . the cosmological model for this simulation was the flat @xmath4cdm model which remains in favor .",
    "even larger simulations are available today and we are interested to see how they fare in their ability to model the topology of large - scale structure .",
    "the `` millennium run '' ( mr hereafter ) , using over 10 billion ( @xmath56 ) dark matter particles @xcite and surveying a cube of side length @xmath57 mpc , has shown structures remarkably like the great wall found by geller & huchra ( 1989 ) , and even wall complexes somewhat resembling the sloan great wall which gott et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measured to span 1.37 billion light years ( springel , frenk & white 2006 ) .",
    "indeed figure 1 in @xcite shows a remarkable visual agreement between what is seen in the millennium run and in slices of the cfa , the 2df survey and the sdss .",
    "the most noticeable difference is that the sloan great wall looks much more visually prominent and coherent than the longest chain of walls found in the mr .",
    "( in this simulation , the box size of @xmath57 mpc cuts off the power spectrum at larger scales . if a simulation were to be made with a larger box size , it would have more power at these larger scales and therefore could more easily produce large coherent structures like the sloan great wall . )",
    "the mr computes dark matter halo formation merger trees and uses a semi - analytic model to simulate the galaxy - formation process where star formation and feedback are modeled by simple analytic physical models . @xcite",
    "have produced mock galaxy samples of their cube that include galaxies brighter than the magellanic clouds , including absolute magnitudes on the sdss system , which allow us to make mock sdss galaxy samples .",
    "park , kim & gott ( 2005 ) produced 8.6 billion particle ( @xmath58 ) simulations that cover volumes of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these simulations employ a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) method to place an appropriate number of galaxies in heavy halos identified by the psb ( kim & park 2006 ) and fof techniques .",
    "these simulations were used to analyze the effects of galaxy formation and bias on topology by park , kim , & gott ( 2005 ) .",
    "more recently , kim & park have produced 1.1 billion particle simulations covering a volume of ( @xmath61 . here they use a new technique to identify physically bound dark matter halos ( not tidally disrupted by larger structures ) at the present epoch and identify these with galaxies ( we call these the dh simulations , for dark ( matter ) halos ) .",
    "they too have produced magnitudes for these mock galaxies on the sdss system by matching the halo mass function with the luminosity function of the sdss galaxies .",
    "cen & ostriker ( 2006 ) have run hydrodynamic simulations covering a smaller cube of ( @xmath62 mpc ) on a side using an 8.6 billion ( @xmath58 ) cell hydro mesh , with ( @xmath63 ) dark matter particles . here",
    "the galaxy formation process is simulated with a hydrodynamic code that identifies collapsing regions , calculates star formation rates , and includes radiative cooling / heating , uv background radiation with local attenuation , and supernova feedback associated with star formation .",
    "again , some assumptions about star formation are made , but this model has one of the most detailed and direct physical calculations of the galaxy formation process available for any simulation that spans a cosmologically - interesting volume .",
    "for further details of the simulation , we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "nagamine has produced the mock catalogs giving absolute magnitudes on the sdss system from the cen & ostriker ( 2006 ) hydro simulations .",
    "the mr simulation , the kim & park dh simulation and the cen & ostriker hydro simulation represent state - of - the - art simulations for different schemes to mimic galaxy formation . while the astronomical community seems to be converging on a standard model for cosmology  the flat @xmath4cdm model ( see , e.g. , reiss et al.1998 , perlmutter et al .  1999 ,",
    "de bernadis et al .  2000 , and spergel et al .",
    "2006)galaxy formation remains an unsolved problem .",
    "this means that since only one cosmological model need be simulated , larger n - body runs exploring different galaxy formation scenarios from different teams can be run . since the parameters in the semi - analytic models",
    "have been tuned to account for other features such as covariance function and multiplicity function , and topology was not considered , topology is a particularly stringent test .",
    "if the models produce the right topology automatically , it would constitute dramatic evidence that their galaxy formation scenarios were on the right track . in any case",

    "these mock catalogs are constructed to cover exactly the same range in absolute magnitude as seen in the observations and so contain very nearly ( within a few percent ) the same total number of galaxies in the sample . because the techniques being applied to the observations and the n - body simulation mock catalogs are identical , the results should be identical ( within statistical variation ) if the n - body simulations are correctly modeling the distribution of galaxies .",
    "in a previous paper ( park et al . 2005 ) we analyzed the three - dimensional topology of large - scale structure in the sdss at a range of smoothing lengths and compare this with theoretical expectations . in the present paper we focus on results with a smoothing length of @xmath111 mpc , which yields the most resolution elements and gives the most important information on galaxy formation .",
    "the sample of galaxies available has now grown significantly larger and so we are now able to make direct comparison of this sample with large n - body simulations and their various methods of modeling of galaxy formation .",
    "as we shall see , the observational sample is now large enough that the topology , as measured by the genus curve @xmath27 , is now a powerful tool for testing models of galaxy formation .",
    "figure  [ fig : surveys ] shows the progression by date of survey of the 3d topology of selected galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "all have similar smoothing lengths of @xmath112 mpc and show the median density contour surface with the high density regions shown as solid and the low density regions as empty . according to standard inflationary theory",
    "this median density contour should be spongelike .",
    "the small cube on the left shows the 3d region studied by gott et al .",
    "the earth is at the lower front right corner of the cube .",
    "the topology is spongelike and the virgo cluster is included in the high density region .",
    "the larger region of isodensity contours in the center of this figure is from the the cfa redshift survey ( vogeley et al .",
    "the earth is at the center and the upper fan shaped region is in the north galactic hemisphere while the lower fan shaped region lies within the south galactic hemisphere .",
    "the great wall noted by geller & huchra ( 1989 ) can be seen connecting high density regions across the top fan - shaped region .",
    "again the topology is spongelike , with the high density regions all connected together , and the low density regions also connected in an interlocking pattern .    finally , the portion of the sdss data now available ( in 2006 , a full twenty years after the first figure ) is shown on the right of figure  [ fig : surveys ] .",
    "this is the largest region yet studied for topology and contains nearly 400,000 galaxies in total .",
    "the location of the earth is at the back .",
    "the horizontal slice extending out toward us is the northern equatorial slice of the sdss and includes the sloan great wall ( gott et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the upper slice is a second contiguous thick region in the northern hemisphere of the sdss .",
    "( when sdss - ii is complete in 2008 , the gap between these two slices will be filled in . )",
    "it is easy to see that the topology of this median density contour is spongelike .",
    "the high density regions ( taking up half the volume ) form one multiply connected region ( shown solid ) and the low density regions ( taking up the other half of the volume ) also form one multiply connected region that is interlocking with the high density region .",
    "figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the same regions of the sdss , but with isodensity contours in different colors for different volume fractions .",
    "the 7% high density regions  containing the highest density 7% of the volume  are solid red .",
    "the end of the sloan great wall can be seen as the red structure snaking from the left to the right in the equatorial slice .",
    "this red contour also shows isolated high density regions ( clusters ) as expected from the random phase genus curve .",
    "the 50% high density contour is shown in transparent green  this contour is a multiply connected spongelike surface that divides the high density half of the sample from the low density half .",
    "the 7% low density regions are shown as solid blue and show isolated voids .",
    "the red and blue regions lie on opposite sides of the transparent green spongelike surface .        to facilitate viewing the three - dimensional nature of the density contours , figure  [ fig : stereo ] shows a stereo pair of the same sdss contours .",
    "this offers our best picture yet of the 3d topology of large scale structure in the universe .",
    "( i.e. , do not divide by the sample volume ) in order to show the genus of the entire sample at each @xmath8 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : genus : r ] shows the genus curve of this volume - limited sdss sample smoothed at @xmath113 mpc . in this figure",
    "we compare the observed genus curve with results for mock surveys produced from the n - body simulations , which we describe in section  [ sect : sims ] below .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig : genus : r ] is the random phase genus curve that best fits the sdss genus curve . the data approximately follow this random phase curve , as expected from inflation . however , there are measurable departures that are likely to have been caused by non - linear effects and galaxy formation .",
    "we characterize these differences from the random phase curve using the measures @xmath19 , @xmath33 , @xmath37 , and @xmath41 described above and plot these values in figures  [ fig : ampdn ]  and  [ fig : avac ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : ampdn ] shows the @xmath114 plane with the sdss values of @xmath114 plotted as a solid blue square , while the black circle indicates the random phase prediction of @xmath115 ( the amplitude of this point is not that of a random phase distribution , but rather is fixed to be the same as the sdss data ) .    the two blue x s show the values computed from the two sdss slices separately  as if each were the only sample studied . in this case , the median density contour is calculated for each sub - sample separately , thus each has a somewhat different density level at the median contour because presence of the sloan great wall in the equatorial sample guarantees that the median density in this sample is greater than in the northern sample .",
    "the difference between the genus parameters of these two sub - samples provides a rough measure of the cosmic variance .",
    "the values of the genus amplitude , @xmath19 , for the two subsamples are of course smaller , which we correct for by dividing each by the respective fraction of the entire volume it represents .    the observed genus curve in figure  [ fig : genus : r ]",
    "is displaced slightly to the left in the central regions ( a slight meatball shift , or a prominence of clusters over voids ) .",

    "the whole sample has a value of @xmath116 .",
    "the sdss great wall itself is a very prominent simply - connected high density region and so by itself can cause a meatball shift . indeed , the equatorial sample which contains the sloan great wall has a value of @xmath117 .",
    "however the northern sample which does not contain the sloan great wall has by itself a value of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , the meatball shift in the data is a general phenomenon and is not due solely to the sloan great wall .",
    "such a meatball shift has been seen in observational samples before .",
    "it was first noticed and commented on by gott et al .",
    "( 1989 ) who examined the cfa , giovanelli & haynes , and tully samples .",
    "gott , cen , and ostriker ( 1996 ) found that hydrodynamic simulations predicted a meatball shift for ( early type ) elliptical galaxies relative to ( late type ) spiral galaxies ( elliptical galaxies tend to congregate more in isolated rich clusters ) , an effect later observed in the 2d topology analysis of the sdss by hoyle et al.(2002 ) where a meatball shift in red ( early type ) galaxies was seen relative to blue ( late type ) galaxies .",
    "thus , it is clear that galaxy formation processes can produce meatball shifts relative to the random phase curve , as we observe with high statistical significance .",

    "2005 ) . in this section",
    "we examine whether current simulations of large - scale structure reproduce these features and use the simulations to assess the statistical significance of these departures from random phase behavior .",

    "we start with the dh simulation .",
    "this simulation has a volume of ( @xmath135 mpc)@xmath133 , which is a bit over 16 times the volume of the sdss sample , allowing roughly that many independent mock surveys .",
    "we create 100 such surveys of the sdss in order to fully sample the structure in the cube with the irregular shape of the sdss ; they are clearly not independent , but the mean and distribution function of the genus statistics are not affected by this .",
    "we show the mean and standard deviations of the genus quantities for the park et al .",
    "simulations in figures  [ fig : ampdn ]  and  [ fig : avac ] with a green hexagon and associated uncertainty limits .",
    "it is clear that the sdss is more than @xmath136 away from the mean value of @xmath33 .",
    "in fact none of the 100 mock surveys has a value of @xmath33 as negative as the observations .",
    "it could be argued that the sdss contains the sdss great wall , which is so unusual that this region should be excluded from the analysis .",
    "however , this is exactly the purpose of the 100 mock surveys : to examine the range of values we expect in sdss - sized surveys .",
    "so the fact that the sdss is outside the 2 sigma error bars from the cosmic variance expected shows that the dh simulations are not successful in predicting the observed meatball shift . also , recall that the values of @xmath33 for both sdss sub - samples ( one not containing the sloan great wall ) are outside these limits .",
    "the dh simulations are perfect in amplitude relative to the data .",
    "importantly , the dh simulations ( as well as the millennium run and the cen and ostriker simulations ) include the effects of baryon oscillations which give the correct initial power spectrum . a similar dh simulation with 8.6 billion particles but without baryon oscillations had an amplitude of @xmath137 , which is @xmath138 high relative to the data ( 191 ) .",
    "this shows that the topology can detect the presence of the baryon oscillations by measuring the slope of the power spectrum ",
    "simulations without them produce an amplitude of the genus curve that is too high .",
    "the values of @xmath139 for those simulations without the baryon oscillations were not appreciably different from the ones that include the baryon oscillations .    for the mr simulation",
    ", we have a volume of ( @xmath140 mpc)@xmath133 which enables us to make roughly 10 independent mock surveys of the sdss . again , to fully sample the cube , we make 50 mock surveys at random position and orientation .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of these mock surveys are shown in figures  [ fig : ampdn ]  and  [ fig : avac ] as a red pentagon with associated error bars .",
    "this indicates the cosmic variance seen from sdss - sized mock surveys drawn from the ( @xmath57 mpc)@xmath133 survey region .",
    "however , we must additionally consider the effect of cosmic variance on the scale of the simulation region : error bars on simulations with smaller box sizes will be somewhat underestimated with respect to larger ( e.g. , the mr w.r.t .",
    "the dh ) , and with respect to the real universe ( which of course has infinite box size ) . to estimate this added variance , we take 8 sub - cubes of volume ( @xmath141 mpc)@xmath133 out of the larger dh simulation of kim & park ( 2007 , in prep . ) mentioned above , of volume ( @xmath142 mpc)@xmath133 , and make redshift maps of them ; i.e. , we give the galaxies their correct @xmath143 and @xmath144 coordinates , but put them at a @xmath70 coordinate equal to @xmath145 as if we were viewing a redshift space map of the survey region from a great distance .",
    "( note that even with the different power spectrum , the variance of the genus statistics should still be correct . )",
    "we then compute the 3d topology for each of the 8 sub - cubes and measure the standard deviation of the 8 mean values of the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath146 .",
    "this cosmic variance of the 8 sub - cubes is added to the variance of the dh sample population ( i.e. , the standard deviations are added in quadrature ) to produce an effective standard deviation we expect to find due to cosmic variance for sdss - sized surveys in the mr if we had a larger ( @xmath142 mpc)@xmath133 simulation from which to draw mock catalogs .",
    "the increase in the standard deviation is only a few percent for the amplitude @xmath19 but @xmath147 for the other three genus statistics ( see table  [ tab : comp ] for both sets of values ) .",
    "we would have liked to make a similar set of sub - cubes for the ( @xmath148 mpc)@xmath133 dh simulation , but of course one can not draw a statistically significant number of samples of that size from a ( @xmath142 mpc)@xmath133 box without significant overlap .",
    "the fact that the mr has a smaller volume also produces a systematic effect in that it has less power in its power spectrum at large scales ( no power beyond ( @xmath57 mpc)@xmath133 ) so we should expect its amplitude @xmath19 to be systematically a little large . actually , the amplitude is lower than for the dh simulations and is about @xmath149 low relative to the data so apparently the effects of cosmic variance in a sample this size are more important than the systematic effect caused by the lack of long - wavelength modes .",
    "for the cen and ostriker hydro simulation we have only one ( @xmath150 mpc)@xmath133 simulation volume .",
    "this is about one - eighth the volume of the sdss region so using its periodic boundary conditions we simply replicate it to make a volume large enough to encompass the sdss .",
    "we then make a mock redshift catalog with the same absolute magnitude limits . because the periodicity kills the large scale power",
    "we expect the simulation to be choppier than the real universe and therefore have a higher amplitude @xmath19 than the observations .",
    "but even more importantly , we expect a large cosmic variance in a sample only as small as ( @xmath62 mpc)@xmath133 . to model this we construct 64 sub cubes each of volume ( @xmath62 mpc)@xmath133 from the mr simulation ( of volume ( @xmath57 mpc)@xmath133 ) , and as above we make redshift maps of them ( giving galaxies their correct @xmath143 and @xmath144 coordinates but put them at a @xmath70 coordinate equal to @xmath151 )",
    ". then we compute the 3d topology for each of the 64 sub cubes and measure the standard deviation of the 64 values of the parameters @xmath114 and @xmath118 .",
    "this cosmic variance from the 64 sub cubes produces the error bars surrounding the one value from the cen et al .",
    "simulation ( shown as a magenta x with error bars . )",
    "we may then add the extra cosmic variance as per the mr data point to produce the standard deviations corresponding to a volume of ( @xmath152 mpc)@xmath133 ( again given in table  [ tab : comp]the extra st.dev .",
    "is @xmath153 for all statistics ) .",
    "these error bars are very large ; this one simulation is not very constraining of the topological properties . roughly speaking",
    ", the volume of the cen and ostriker simulation is an eighth that of the sdss so we expect error bars that are roughly @xmath154 times as large as for the cosmic variance seen in the sdss .",
    "this ratio is approximately correct as figures  [ fig : ampdn ]  &  [ fig : avac ] show .    in figure",
    "[ fig : genus : r ] we show the genus curve for the cen and ostriker simulation .",
    "it is not a good fit to the sdss observations .",
    "the top of the genus curve is chopped off , and it has a meatball shift in the void region that is not seen in the observations . in the central region @xmath155 , where @xmath33 is measured , the curve is too fat , but also has a small negative value of @xmath156 .",
    "this is more negative than either the mr or the dh simulations , but is still not very close to the observed value of @xmath116 .",
    "the amplitude of the cen and ostriker simulation is much lower than the other three data sets .",
    "overall the cen et al .  simulation does not give a good fit to the data ; however , the volume of the simulation is small and the large error bars show that the observations are within 2 sigma in both @xmath33 and @xmath19 .",
    "( to be fair , other hydro simulations by cen and his collaborators  for example , gott , cen , & ostriker 1996have produced good looking genus curves , so this one may be suffering from a bit of bad luck . )",
    "so , currently , the cen and ostriker hydro simulations are too small .",
    "they need to be increased in volume by about a factor of 10 to be fairly tested against the sdss . in 1975",
    "the largest n - body cosmological simulation had 4,000 particles ( aarseth , gott , & turner 1975 ) . in 1990 the largest n - body cosmological simulation had 4 million particles ( park 1990 ) .",
    "this led gott to predict in 1990 that by 2005 the record would be 4 billion particles .",
    "springel et al.(2005 ) did even better than this with over 10 billion particles .",
    "an increase of a factor of 10 every 5 years is just what would be predicted by moore s law ( a doubling every 18 months ) .",
    "so given moore s law we should expect that cen and his colleagues will have a hydro code simulation with volume 10 times larger by 2011 .",
    "then we can see if it outperforms the mr or the dh simulations .",
    "just one additional hydro run with the same parameters would also be interesting  would it be closer to the observations ( suggesting some bad luck in the current run ) or further away ? with the current error bars , the mr , dh simulations , and the cen and ostriker simulations are all consistent with each other within @xmath157 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : avac ] we compare the results for @xmath37 and @xmath41 . here the observations and the millennium run and the dh simulations are in better agreement .",
    "the observations have values of @xmath158 which depart from those of the random phase genus curve @xmath119 .",
    "as we have mentioned , values of @xmath36 on these scales are not produced by non - linear gravitational clustering but must be produced by biased galaxy formation ( park , kim & gott 2005 ) . here",
    "the millennium run and the dh simulations are both moved from the random phase value in the direction of the observations .",
    "the dh simulation does better , being nearly perfect in @xmath41 and just over one sigma away in @xmath37 .",
    "the millennium run is within one sigma in @xmath41 and around @xmath159 away in @xmath37 ( neglecting cosmic variance ) .",
    "again , the cen and ostriker simulation is further away in @xmath41 , but its larger error bars leave it within 1 sigma in both @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",
    "a possible issue with all these simulations is that their initial conditions assume a value of @xmath160 at the present epoch to be consistent with the fit for the wmap first - year data ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , but the wmap three - year data prefer a lower value of @xmath161 ( spergel et al .",
    "this implies less non - linear growth of clustering up to the present epoch , and more biasing . we can estimate the possible effect of using a smaller value of @xmath162 by examining the genus statistics at a slightly earlier epoch in a simulation designed to reach linear @xmath160 at @xmath163 .",
    "for example , at @xmath164 ( when @xmath161 ) in the dh simulations , we find that dark matter halos with the same density as the @xmath163 halos have @xmath165 , versus @xmath166 .",
    "compared to the discrepancy of @xmath33 between the sdss data and simulations , this is an infinitesimal effect and we conclude that this does not appear to be a problem .",
    "we reach similar conclusions about the effect of @xmath162 on @xmath37 and @xmath41 . the small size of these effects over this range of redshift ( and so , over this same range of @xmath162 ) can also be seen in figure 4 of park et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "another small but interesting effect has to do with halo or galaxy identification : nearby halos ( or galaxies in the hydro simulation ) may get merged together and only counted as one point .",

    "the most notable feature of the observations is a meatball shift @xmath116 showing a slight prominence of isolated high density regions over isolated voids .",
    "the sdss great wall is one large connected isolated high density region and contributes to this effect , but the effect also shows up in the northern part of the sdss which does not contain the sloan great wall . if the sloan great wall were entirely responsible for this result one might argue that it was produced by rare objects whose frequency of occurrence was determined by the power in the initial conditions at very large scales and that even larger simulations @xmath181 would be needed to properly test for this effect .",
    "but this is not the case .",
    "negative values of @xmath116 show up even in the part of the survey that does not include the sdss great wall .",

    "the observed @xmath33 values are more than @xmath0 away from the values found in the mr and the dark matter halo simulations .",

    "we look forward to improvements in the n - body simulations .",
    "of particular interest is how well larger hydrodynamic simulations will perform when compared with larger samples , and whether there will be a convergence of predictions as both hydrodynamic and merger tree , and dynamical halo occupation methods are improved .",
    "galaxy formation is not yet a solved problem in cosmology and the 3d topology offers a strong test of models which is independent of other measures .",

    "<S> each of these simulations uses a different method for modeling galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss data show a genus curve that is broadly characteristic of that produced by gaussian random phase initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus the data strongly support the standard model of inflation where gaussian random phase initial conditions are produced by random quantum fluctuations in the early universe . </S>",

    "<S> matsubara 1994 ) , and biasing connected with galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> the n - body simulations have been tuned to reproduce the power spectrum and multiplicity function but not topology , so topology is an acid test for these models . </S>",
    "<S> the data show a `` meatball '' shift ( only partly due to the sloan great wall of galaxies ; this shift also appears in a sub - sample not containing the wall ) which differs at the @xmath0 level from the results of the millennium run and the kim & park dark halo models , even including the effects of cosmic variance . </S>"
