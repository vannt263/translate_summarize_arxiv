    "the reconstruction of a function from its scale components is given by the inverse wavelet transform @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the are of the unit sphere in @xmath19 dimensions , is the normalization for the isotropic wavelets .",
    "performing the wavelet transform ( in spatial coordinate ) of the fields and the random force in the langevin equation , we get the possibility to substitute the white noise by a scale - dependent random force @xmath20 in case the spectral density of the random force is a constant @xmath21 , the inverse wavelet transform @xmath22 drives the process into the white noise .    in case of arbitrary functions",
    "@xmath23 we have more possibilities .",
    "in particular , we can define a narrow band forcing that acts at a single scale @xmath24 the contribution of the scales with the wave vectors apart from the the typical scale @xmath25 is suppressed by rapidly vanishing wings of the compactly supported wavelet @xmath26 .    here",
    "we present two examples of the divergence free stochastic perturbation expansion : ( i ) the scalar field theory @xmath27 , ( ii ) the non - abelian gauge field theory .",
    "let us turn to the stochastic quantization of the @xmath27 theory with the scale - dependent noise @xcite .",
    "the euclidean action of the @xmath27 theory is @xmath28= \\int d^d x \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } ( \\d\\phi)^2 + \\frac{m^2}{2}\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{3!}\\phi^3 \\right ] .",

    "for instance , the use of the mexican hat wavelet @xmath36 for the single band random force gives the effective force correlator @xmath37 the loop integrals taken with this effective force correlator can be easily seen to be free of ultra - violet divergences @xmath38",
    "the euclidean action of a non - abelian field is given by @xmath39 = \\frac{1}{4 } \\int d^d x f_{\\mu\\nu}^a(x)f_{\\mu\\nu}^a(x ) ,   \\label{ym1 } \\quad f_{\\mu\\nu}^a(x ) = \\d_\\mu a_\\nu^a(x ) -\\d_\\nu a_\\mu^a(x ) + g f^{abc}a_\\mu^b(x ) a_\\nu^c(x).\\ ] ] the langevin equation for the gauge theory can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the random force and @xmath42 is the nonlinear interaction term @xmath43 = \\frac{g}{2}v^0(a , a ) + \\frac{g^2}{6}w^0(a , a , a).\\ ] ] the stochastic diagram technique for the gauge field langevin equation is summarized in the table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "since there is no dynamic evolution for the longtitudal modes in the langevin equation , it is natural to use the transversal scale - dependent random force @xmath45 let us consider a gluon loop with two cubic vertices . summing up over the gauge group indices @xmath46 with @xmath47 for @xmath48 groups , we can wright the gluon loop as a sum of two diagrams  those with the transversal and the longtitudal stochastic green functions @xmath49 where @xmath50 as it can be observed after explicit evaluation of the tensor structures @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and integration over @xmath53 , the wavelet factor in the effective force correlator @xmath54 will suppress the divergences for a narrow - band forcing .",

    "the stochastic quantization with a forcing localized at a given scale @xmath59 is in some way similar to the lattice regularization with the mesh size of order @xmath59 .",
    "however there is a question what is the physical sense of the scale components , and what are the implications for canonical quantization of these fields ?",
    "the answer to the first question stems from the definition of wavelet transform : the scale component @xmath60 is a projection of the state vector @xmath61 to a certain multiresolution space @xcite , where @xmath16 is a basis , i.e. , the basic wavelet stands for the aperture of the microscope by which we perceive the system @xmath61 . to clarify the second question one can use the wavelet decomposition @xmath62 , \\label{wlop } \\\\",
