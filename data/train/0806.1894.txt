    "acquiring sufficient data of sufficient accuracy is the standard problem in the use of applicable mathematics .",
    "reliance upon null measurements  i.e . , an answer of yes or no  is often an intelligent way of attending to the latter desideratum , as in the familiar limiting dilution assays [ lefkowitz and waldman , 1979 ] . but the former frequently is controlled by experimental inability , or perhaps excessive expense , in dealing with some region of data .",
    "if enough is surmised about the structure of the data , such regions can be reduced by suitable extrapolation , but the implicit assumption [ for an elegant presentation , see berman , 2006 ] of some sort of analytic structure runs the risk of being too much of a mathematical band - aid unless it is justified by a versatile underlying model .    in this note",
    ", we address a situation of some generality .",
    "it is that in which an organism , biological or mechanical , is continually subjected to transient defects , e.g.  pathogenic molecular species , internally or externally incited but soon eliminated .",
    "these inhibit its ability to effectively deal with its environment .",
    "we imagine that the net pathogen level @xmath2 is measurable at occasional time intervals , but only if it exceeds some threshold @xmath0 ( i.e.  @xmath3 )",
    ". a null measurement sequence would then give the relative frequency @xmath4 of measurements falling below the threshold @xmath0 .",
    "we would want e.g.  to obtain from this the density function @xmath5 of amplitudes of the pathogen aggregate level , @xmath2 , with particular attention to the unavailable low amplitudes .",
    "the total pathogen load @xmath2 at a given measurement would be expected to be the resultant of the current amplitudes of each of the sources ; these sources may be imagined as time - displaced versions of a discrete set of types , and this is the model that we will study in detail .",
    "the model was originally used in a somewhat different context , that of the significance of `` blips '' in hiv viral level in patients undergoing multi - drug therapy .",

    "the relationship between the intrinsic @xmath5 and @xmath6 is obvious @xmath8 just the cummulative distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "our task is now to obtain the form of @xmath5 from the model assumptions and use this e.g.  to extrapolate the available @xmath6 for @xmath7 to values @xmath9 .",
    "we imagine that the arriving pulses are all translations in time of a basic set of shapes indexed by @xmath10 @xmath11 these shapes are non - negative functions such that @xmath12 now , place each of these functions , independently on the interval @xmath13 times . to do this ,",
    "let @xmath14 be a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath15 and @xmath16 a possion random variable with mean @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 the location in time of @xmath19 is determined , for example , so that its maximum is at the origin ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the time coordinate of the maximum point of the @xmath20 occurrence of @xmath19 is then denoted by @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the equation of the @xmath20 occurrence of the curve @xmath19 is then @xmath23 the total amplitude at any specified time , say @xmath24 , is @xmath25 we would like to find the probability density of the random variable @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the probability density function of the random variable @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 we will assume a steady state distribution of `` pathogens '' in the course of measurements .",
    "this is a limitation of our approach : often the life - time of the organism may be comparable to the `` decay '' of pathogen . then the system is translation - invariant in time , which is why we can choose , without loss of generality , the observation time @xmath24 , as in ( [ 2.3 ] ) .",
    "let us construct the generating function for @xmath5 @xmath28 then @xmath29 we need @xmath30 so that @xmath31 but from ( [ 2.2 ] ) , @xmath32 , and we see at once that @xmath33,\\ ] ] or letting @xmath34 , @xmath35,\\ ] ] which is our basic expression .",

    "then for any function @xmath43 we have @xmath44 it follows that @xmath45 so that if @xmath46 we have the simple equality @xmath47",
    "( [ 2.13 ] ) can of course be solved for @xmath5 in nominal closed form by applying the inverse laplace transform . but",
    "a less formal path is to use ( [ 2.13 ] ) to set up an equation that @xmath5 satisfies . for this purpose ,",
    "take the logarithm of the equality ( [ 2.13 ] ) and apply the operation @xmath48 to both sides , yielding    @xmath49    and we have used the fact that @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
