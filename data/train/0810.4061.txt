    "the columns are ordered so that all absorption - time vectors associated to a given cave are grouped together , before those of the next cave , and so forth .",
    "the matrix is visualised as a gray - scale colour map by placing a tiny _ black _ square where either @xmath69 ( that is , along the diagonal ) or @xmath70 ( the minimal off - diagonal absorption time observed ) , a _ white _ square where @xmath71 ( the maximum observed ) , and discretising the intermediate values to 254 gray - scale colours correspondingly .",
    "the caves can be distinguished as dark five - by - five blocks along the diagonal , although the matrix is somewhat too noisy to be trivially clustered .",

    "spectral clustering of points in space , often modelled as ( complete ) weighted graphs , is a widely studied topic @xcite . in the context of graphs ,",
    "the technique is usually applied so that some right eigenvector associated to the smallest nonzero eigenvalue @xmath99 of @xmath23 is used to produce a bipartitioning of the graph such that those vertices that have negative values in the eigenvector form one side of the bipartition @xmath2 and the vertices with positive values are the other side @xmath100 .",
    "these eigenvectors are called _ fiedler vectors _ following @xcite , where the technique was first proposed .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors based on @xmath24 are called _ normalised _ fiedler vectors . the works on fiedler - vector based",

    "an example is the zachary karate club network of figure [ fig : karate ] : the corresponding fiedler vectors are shown in figure [ fig : lapkarate ] . also , recursively performing bipartitions on the subgraphs induced by @xmath2 and @xmath3 will help cluster the input graph @xmath1 in more than two clusters , but a _ stopping condition _ needs to be imposed to determine when to stop bipartitioning the resulting subgraphs further .    .",
    "the vertices can be classified in two groups : those with positive values in the fiedler vector and those with negative values.,width=483 ]      the use of fiedler vectors for graph bipartitioning can be motivated as follows ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "we follow @xcite in using the normalised laplacian @xmath24 and choosing @xmath134 , or equivalently @xmath135 as the boundary condition .",

    "it can be noted , from the top row of plots in figure  [ fig : examples ] , that the spectra of the graphs @xmath57 matrices do not exhibit large gaps between their second and third largest eigenvalues .",
    "thus , it can not be expected _ a priori _ that the fiedler - vector based approximations to the absorption times , from equation  ( [ eq : approxabsvect ] ) , would be even of the same magnitude as the exact ones , as calculated from equations  ( [ eq : rowsums ] ) and  ( [ eq : fundamental ] ) .",
    "( observe also how the structure of the caveman graph is reflected in the corresponding @xmath57 spectrum : a notable eigenvalue gap occurs after the six largest eigenvalues , each representing the dominant convergence behaviour of one of the clusters . )    correlations between the approximate and exact absorption times are apparent in the quantile - quantile plots presented in the second row of figure  [ fig : examples ] : here the values group diagonally when a linear dependency exists .",

    "experimentally we have confirmed that the values given by the approximation are nearly perfectly correlated with the exact absorption times even in the absence of such a gap .",
    "our motivation is to use the absorption times into a seed vertex @xmath9 as a measure of proximity in two - classifying the graph into two partitions : vertices that are `` relevant '' to the seed vertex and other vertices .",
    "hence , not knowing the exact values but rather another vector of perfectly correlated values is sufficient for separating between the vertices with higher values from those with lower values ( which is the classical two - classification task ) .",
    "such a two - partition of a graph is known as local clustering . in order for the proposed values to be locally computable ,",
    "we have also presented a gradient - descent method to approximate the fiedler vector using only local information in the graph .",
    "the method iteratively processes the neighbourhoods of vertices starting from the seed vertex and expanding outwards within the group of potentially `` relevant '' vertices , without any need to process other parts of the graph .",
    "we have illustrated the potential of these vectors in two - classification for local clustering on a classical example graph representing a social network .",
    "in further work , we seek to study further the effects of the presence or absence of a spectral gap in the input graph into the approximation proposed .",
    "we also want to calibrate the parameters of the locally computable approximation in such a way that no a priori knowledge of the input graph would be needed , but that the method would rather adapt to the structure of the graph at runtime by dynamic parameter adjustment . of additional interest",
    "are extensions of this work to weighted and directed graphs as well as case studies of applications of local clustering .",
    "we also contemplate possible uses for approximate absorption times in resolving other problems of interest that involve complex systems represented as graphs .",
