    "ultraviolet and x - ray observations have demonstrated that among main sequence stars stellar coronae are a ubiquitous phenomenon , with coronal emissions being detectable for all stars with spectral types later than a5  v ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is not the case , however , above the main sequence . for giant stars , f and g type giants",
    "are coronal , but this coronal emission either disappears entirely or at least dramatically weakens for k and m type giants . for",
    "the k and m giants , the coronae seem to be largely replaced by strong winds ( @xmath7 m@xmath8  yr@xmath2 ) at chromospheric temperatures ( @xmath9  k ) .",
    "the first recognition of the existence of this coronal dividing line among evolved stars between coronal and `` windy '' stars was by @xcite .",
    "if attention is limited to giant stars , i.e.  luminosity class iii stars , the dividing line lies at a spectral type of about k2  iii @xcite .",
    "the nature of the transition across this dividing line is a topic of particular interest .",
    "some stars to the right of the dividing line , referred to as `` hybrid chromosphere '' stars , seem to maintain some level of coronal emission , with @xmath5  dra ( k5  iii ) being perhaps the best - studied luminosity class iii example @xcite . this has led to the proposition that magnetic loops with coronal temperatures still persist beyond the dividing line , but the coronal emissions from these loops are completely or mostly hidden by the dense , thick chromospheres that have developed for such stars , from which emanate the strong chromospheric winds @xcite . in order to further investigate the transition from coronae to chromospheric winds , we here present a new survey of red giant stars with spectral types later than k2  iii , using uv spectra taken by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "we are not only interested in the winds of these stars , but also in the interactions of these winds with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "ultraviolet spectroscopy from hst has provided the first spectroscopic detections of the wind - ism interaction regions , or `` astrospheres , '' of many cool stars , including the heliospheric structure surrounding our own sun .",
    "hydrogen lyman-@xmath6 absorption has been observed from the `` hydrogen wall '' region outside the heliopause @xcite , and from the heliotail @xcite .",
    "hydrogen wall absorption has also been observed around other sun - like stars , representing the first method by which solar - like coronal winds can be detected around other stars @xcite .",
    "however , we are here interested in the astrospheres of red giant stars . observations of the mg  ii h & k lines near 2800    have been used to detect absorption from the astrosphere of @xmath6  tau ( k5  iii ) @xcite .",
    "models of the @xmath6  tau astrosphere were computed using codes designed to study the heliosphere .",
    "analogous to the solar wind , the red giant wind expands radially from the star until it reaches the termination shock ( ts ) , where it is shocked to subsonic speeds .",
    "the post - ts wind is slower , hotter , and more dense .",
    "it is this post - ts region that provides mg  ii column densities sufficiently high to yield the observed mg  ii astrospheric absorption .    due to its high positive stellar radial velocity ( @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 )",
    ", our line of sight towards @xmath6  tau is estimated to be at an angle of @xmath11 from the upwind direction of the ism flow vector in the rest frame of the star .",
    "this line of sight is therefore very much through the `` astrotail , '' and this may be essential for detecting the astrospheric absorption .",
    "a downwind line of sight provides a much longer path length through the post - ts material than an upwind or sidewind line of sight , leading to much higher column densities through the post - ts material @xcite . nevertheless , the hydrodynamic models of the @xmath6  tau astrosphere were unable to reproduce the observed astrospheric absorption very well , predicting far too little absorption , and placing the absorption farther from the stellar rest frame than observed .",
    "the proposed explanation was that the @xmath6  tau ts is a radiative shock , with radiative cooling from h lyman lines yielding further compression and deceleration behind the ts , resulting in a stronger mg  ii absorption feature closer to the rest frame of the star , in better agreement with the observed absorption @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6  tau observation has long been the only example of a detected red giant astrosphere .",
    "our new hst survey of red giant stars was not only designed to study the red giant winds , but also designed to try to find new detections of astrospheric absorption around such stars .",
    "we are interested in the warm , partially ionized winds and resulting astrospheres of giants with spectral types between k2  iii and m5  iii .",
    "we do not consider stars later than m5 , because such giants contain miras and other long period variables , which have cooler and more massive winds of a different character , and we do not consider giants earlier than k2 , which lie on the wrong side of the coronal dividing line mentioned in section  1 , exhibiting high - temperature coronal emission instead of strong chromospheric winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the idea that a downwind line of sight through the astrotail is essential for detecting the mg  ii astrospheric absorption signature , all the selected targets have @xmath12 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this choice has the added benefit of shifting the astrospheric absorption and stellar wind absorption away from the expected locations of narrow interstellar mg  ii absorption , which can confuse analysis of the line profile .    lcccccccccccc star & alternate & spect .",

    "these stars are also listed in table  1 , as we will consider their mg  ii spectra as well , although only @xmath6  tau has the high @xmath18 that we presume to be advantageous for astrospheric detection .",
    "the properties listed in table  1 are spectral type , v band magnitude , v - k color , temperature , radius , distance , radial velocity ( @xmath18 ) , logarithmic mg  ii surface flux ( f@xmath20 , in ergs  @xmath40  s@xmath2 units ) , stellar wind terminal velocity ( @xmath0 ) , the ism velocity seen by the star ( @xmath23 ) , and the orientation of our line of sight to the star with respect to the upwind direction ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the simbad database was utilized to find the v magnitudes , v - k colors , distances @xcite , and heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "the v - k colors are used in the estimation of both the photospheric effective temperatures and stellar radii , based on the prescriptions of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the radii computed in this manner should have uncertainties of 11.7% @xcite .",
    "five of the stars have interferometric radii measured by @xcite .",
    "the only one initially found to be in poor agreement was @xmath30  gem .",
    "the discrepancy was resolved by replacing the initially assumed magnitude with the 2mass catalog s @xmath41 value @xcite , changing the v - k color and inferred radius significantly .    in computing the last two quantities of table  1 regarding the ism flow direction and magnitude at each star , which are relevant for astrospheric studies , we note that our target stars are all close enough to be within the local bubble ( lb ) , a region of generally low ism density extending roughly 100  pc from the sun in most directions @xcite .",
    "we verify that the stars are within the lb using the lb maps of @xcite .",
    "most of the volume of the lb is believed to be very hot , ionized plasma , which produces much of the soft x - ray background emission @xcite .",
    "the flow vector of the lb material is uncertain , but a plausible assumption is that it is roughly at rest relative to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . combining this assumption with the known proper motion and radial velocity of our target stars , we can estimate the ism flow vector seen in the rest frame of the star and its orientation relative to our line of sight to the star , characterized by the @xmath23 and @xmath26 parameters in table  1 .",
    "all the new survey stars have @xmath42 , confirming that the lines of sight to these stars are expected to be very downwind , which was one of the desired selection criteria to maximize the likelihood of detecting astrospheric absorption .",
    "the nine newly observed stars were observed by the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) instrument on hst @xcite , with the observations occurring between 2013 october and 2015 january . for each of our targets , the hst visit consisted of a spectrum of the 25742851    wavelength range taken with stis s high resolution ( @xmath43 ) e230h grating , followed by a longer exposure of the 11501700    wavelength range taken with the moderate resolution ( @xmath44 ) e140 m grating .",
    "our focus here is on the mg  ii h & k lines within the e230h spectrum , with rest wavelengths of 2803.5315    and 2796.3543   , respectively @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6  tau spectrum considered is the same as that studied by @xcite , which is from 1994  april  8 , and is a product of the ech - b grating on the uv spectrometer that preceded stis on hst , the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) .",
    "the other three archival mg  ii spectra considered are all stis / e230h observations , from 1998  august  24 , 2011  august  11 , and 2011  august  4 for @xmath6  boo , @xmath5  dra , and @xmath5  cru , respectively .",
    "figure  1 displays the mg  ii spectra of all the k2-m5  iii stars listed in table  1 , in spectral type order .",
    "we also include in the figure an archival hst / ghrs mg  ii spectrum of the k0  iii star @xmath45  gem @xcite .",
    "being on the coronal side of the dividing line mentioned in section  1 , the @xmath45  gem spectrum serves to illustrate what a red giant chromospheric mg  ii line profile should look like in the absence of an opaque stellar wind .",
    "the stellar rest frame is indicated in figure  1 , but for two stars in our sample that are spectroscopic binaries the figure instead indicates the systemic center - of - mass radial velocity and the range of velocities covered by the red giants in their elliptical orbits .",
    "these two systems are @xmath6  tuc ( k3  iii+ ? ) and @xmath4  pup ( k5  iii+g5  v ) , with orbital periods of 4197.7 and 257.8 days , respectively @xcite . the actual radial velocities of the red giants at the times of observation are best estimated from narrow h@xmath46 lines in the fuv e140 m spectrum , which suggest radial velocities of 42 and 103 km  s@xmath2 for @xmath6  tuc and @xmath4  pup , respectively .",
    "the implications of @xmath4  pup s binarity will be discussed in detail in section  6 .",
    "the mg  ii profiles are complicated by the presence of intervening absorbers in between the stellar chromosphere and the observer .",
    "these absorbers include the stellar wind , the ism , and the stellar astrosphere .",
    "given that all our stars are relatively nearby , we expect the ism absorption to be relatively close to the velocity predicted by the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) vector measured for the ism cloud immediately surrounding the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "multiple ism velocity components are often observed even for very nearby stars , but not typically at velocities separated by more than @xmath47 km  s@xmath2 from the lic velocity @xcite .",
    "the lic velocity is shown explicitly in all the figure  1 panels .",
    "there is always absorption observed at that location .",
    "although the figure identifies the absorption as lic , there could be a blend of ism velocity components , particularly in cases like hd  87837 where the absorption feature is particularly broad and not well centered on the lic velocity . in several cases ( @xmath6  tuc , @xmath30  gem , and @xmath32  eri ) there is a separate , distinct narrow absorption feature adjacent to the lic absorption that we suspect is interstellar , and it is identified as such in figure  1 .",
    "our selection of stars with high , positive radial velocities shifts the stellar wind absorption redward of the ism absorption in all cases , generally far enough to adequately separate the two . among our new survey targets , only for @xmath32  eri have we ended up with a case where the lic absorption is clearly within the saturated core of the wind absorption , making it impossible to separate the two and complicating analysis of the absorption .",
    "we compute integrated mg  ii h and k line fluxes for all the red giant target stars .",
    "we correct for ism absorption by interpolating a continuum over the ism features identified in figure  1 .",
    "figure  2a shows the k / h flux ratio plotted versus photospheric temperature .",
    "the ratio clearly increases towards later spectral types .",
    "the ratio would be 2 in an optically thin plasma , but stellar chromospheres are highly optically thick to mg  ii emission , so values less than 2 are always observed @xcite .",
    "the spectral type dependence of k / h seen in figure  2a , which is not seen for main sequence stars , is indicative of systematic changes in the chromospheric opacity towards the later type giants , which will have lower surface gravities due to larger radii ( see table  1 ) .",
    "past solar and stellar chromospheric models have discussed the diagnostic potential of the k / h ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after summing up the flux of both the h and k lines , we can compare the hst fluxes with those measured previously by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "for the eight stars we have in common with the @xcite compilation of evolved star iue mg  ii fluxes we find reasonably good agreement , with no systematic flux discrepancies , and an average difference of only 20.8% .",
    "we convert the fluxes at earth to surface fluxes ( f@xmath20 ) in ergs  @xmath40  s@xmath2 units , which are listed logarithmically in table  1 .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in the surface fluxes lies in the stellar radii .",
    "the 11.7% angular diameter uncertainty from @xcite translates into a 23.4% error in f@xmath20 , which leads to 0.09  dex uncertainties for the @xmath48  f@xmath20 values in table  1 .    in figure  2b ,",
    "the mg  ii fluxes are plotted versus temperature .",
    "there is a strong correlation , and a simple line fits the data quite well , suggesting @xmath49 the correlation is apparent whether f@xmath20 is plotted versus spectral type , v - k , or temperature . the 1@xmath4 scatter about the fitted line is only 0.054 dex , or about 13% , which is less than the 23.4% f@xmath20 uncertainty estimated above .",
    "the remarkably tight correlation between chromospheric activity and temperature ( or spectral type ) seen for red giants is very different from what is found for main sequence stars . for main sequence stars , the mg",
    "ii fluxes span a range of about a factor of 30 at a given spectral type , due to chromospheric and coronal emission being largely determined by rotation rate , which can vary greatly ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the homogeneity of k2-m5  iii mg  ii fluxes at a given spectral type is consistent with the idea that on the noncoronal side of the dividing line giant stars are all rotating very slowly , and at a given spectral type the stars are therefore producing chromospheric emission at basically the same basal flux level @xcite .",
    "we found rotational velocity measurements for eight of our thirteen stars @xcite , and all are slow rotators . only @xmath4",
    "pup has a rotational velocity above 2 km  s@xmath2 , with @xmath50 km  s@xmath2 . in figure  2b , our mg  ii fluxes",
    "are compared with the `` v - k model '' basal flux line of @xcite , based on iue measurements of many more stars over a wider range of spectral types , albeit with many coronally active stars not emitting at a basal level .",
    "there is reasonably good agreement , though our measurements suggest a slightly steeper relation , @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 , at least in this spectral type range .",
    "one paradigm for the basal chromosphere phenomenon is that it represents the chromospheric heating level due to the dissipation of acoustic waves generated from photospheric oscillations , and in the absence of significant magnetic activity this is the dominant chromospheric heating mode @xcite .",
    "acoustic heating models appear to be able to successfully reproduce the observed dependence of basal flux on photospheric temperature , a dependence that is similar on both giants and main sequence stars . however , alternative views exist , which suggest that a base level of magnetic activity is instead responsible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "support for this view comes from the existence of a basal level of coronal x - ray emission for main sequence stars , which it is widely accepted requires a magnetic origin @xcite .",
    "it is less clear that a basal x - ray emission level exists for k2-m5  iii stars , as so few have reliable x - ray detections @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the detection of magnetic fields on the supergiant betelgeuse @xcite and the mira @xmath53  cyg @xcite , as well as the observation of an x - ray outburst on mira itself @xcite , demonstrates that even very cool , evolved , and slowly rotating stars still have some magnetic activity , and many models of red giant chromospheres and wind acceleration rely on the presence of magnetic fields and alfvn waves @xcite .",
    "even in the absence of the ism absorption , wind scattering , and astrospheric absorption , the mg  ii line profiles are already complex due to the high opacity of the chromospheric mg  ii lines .",
    "the @xmath45  gem line profile in figure  1 is double - peaked , with a stronger blue peak .",
    "such `` self - reversals '' are typical for chromospheric mg  ii lines , including ones observed from the sun , and the blue peak is commonly found to be the stronger one @xcite . none of the k2-m5  iii mg  ii profiles are like that of @xmath45  gem .",
    "the closest are the spectra of hd  66141 ( k2  iii ) and @xmath6  tuc ( k3  iii ) , which might be interpreted as being chromospheric lines that happen to have stronger red peaks , but it is far more likely that this shift in flux from blue peak to red peak is an indication of a chromospheric wind scattering flux from the blue side of the line to the red",
    ".    the wind will naturally be most opaque just bluewards of the stellar rest frame , extending to the wind s terminal velocity , and even beyond it to an extent determined by the turbulent velocities in the wind at its terminal speed .",
    "the wind will be a photon - scattering environment in which mg  ii photons absorbed and reemitted by mg@xmath54 ions in the wind will preferentially escape by frequency scattering away from the velocities at which the wind is most opaque ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for most of the stars in figure  1 ,",
    "the result is a broad , deep , saturated wind absorption feature blueward of the stellar rest frame .",
    "however , for three of the stars close to the dividing line at k2-k4  iii ( hd  66141 , @xmath6  tuc , and hd  87837 ) the wind is apparently weaker and less opaque , and the effect on the line profile is more subtle , yielding merely a line asymmetry with more flux emerging redward of the stellar rest frame .",
    "the exception is the well - studied k2  iii star @xmath6  boo , which shows deep wind absorption despite being very close to the coronal dividing line , implying a high mass loss rate of @xmath55 m@xmath8  yr@xmath2 @xcite . for the stars that have deep wind absorption , we can estimate the terminal wind speed ( @xmath0 ) empirically , based on the following prescription .",
    "first , we determine the maximum flux level within the mg  ii k line blueward of the stellar rest frame ( e.g. , @xmath56 ergs  @xmath40  s@xmath2  @xmath2 for @xmath26  cma ) .",
    "second , we divide this value by an admittedly arbitrary factor of 20 , and we then determine at what velocity that flux level is reached on the blue side of the wind absorption ( @xmath57 ) . in the stellar rest frame , this represents an upper bound for @xmath0 .",
    "next , we determine at what velocity that flux level is reached on the red side of the wind absorption ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the average of @xmath57 and @xmath58 represents an estimate of the center of the wind absorption , which in the stellar rest frame provides an estimate of the lower bound of @xmath0 .",
    "the shaded regions in figure  1 indicate the range of @xmath0 implied by these lower and upper bounds for all the stars . if microturbulent velocities in the stellar wind at the terminal velocity are low ( e.g. , a few km  s@xmath2 ) then the upper bound ( i.e. , the left edge of the shaded region ) should be close to @xmath0 ; but if turbulent velocities are high then the lower bound ( i.e. , the right edge of the shaded region ) would be a better estimate @xcite . in any case , with the bounds on @xmath0 now defined , we can now quote an estimate of @xmath0 with error bars , which are listed in table  1 . mathematically , if v@xmath59 and v@xmath60 are in a heliocentric rest frame , as in figure  1 , then @xmath61 $ ] , with uncertainty @xmath62 .",
    "we can not use this prescription for the first three giants listed in table  1 , which do not have the deep , saturated wind absorption features ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the k5  iii giant @xmath5  dra is a special case .",
    "it does not possess a broad , deep stellar wind absorption feature , but there is a rather narrow dip at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath63 km  s@xmath2 in figure  1 , which is likely indicative of the wind terminal velocity .",
    "this implies a very high wind speed of @xmath64 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "an older hst / ghrs spectrum of @xmath5  dra studied by @xcite shows a similar profile , but with the absorption feature less blueshifted , suggesting @xmath65 km  s@xmath2",
    ". however , @xcite find it difficult to interpret the mg  ii profile with a single wind component , and propose the existence of a slower wind component ( with @xmath66 km  s@xmath2 ) in addition to the fast one producing the narrow absorption dip .",
    "the speed of this slower wind component is more consistent with that observed for the other k giants .",
    "the mg  ii profiles of @xmath5  dra are in most respects similar to those of hd  87837 ( k4  iii ) , but hd  87837 does not have the absorption dip far from the stellar rest frame that would suggest that there is necessarily opaque stellar wind material at those high speeds .",
    "it is tempting to associate @xmath5  dra s unusually fast wind with the star also being one of the most well - known hybrid - chromosphere giants , with weak but detectable coronal x - ray emission @xcite , and detectable transition region uv emission from lines such as c  iv @xmath671548 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a very high wind speed of @xmath68 km  s@xmath2 for @xmath6  tra ( k4  ii ) , which is another canonical hybrid chromosphere star . before the hst era",
    ", @xcite previously noted a possible correlation between the hybrid chromosphere stars and high speed mg  ii wind absorption features in iue spectra .",
    "thus , both the hst and iue databases of red giant spectra seem to be consistent with the notion that red giants with unusually strong transition region and coronal emissions also have high speed wind components .",
    "the wind velocities of the m giants are clearly lower than those of the k giants in our sample , with @xmath69 km  s@xmath2 for k2  iii stars near the coronal dividing line , and @xmath70 km  s@xmath2 at m5  iii .",
    "the correlation is shown explicitly in figure  2c , which plots @xmath0 versus photospheric temperature . excluding the clearly discrepant @xmath5  dra , the linear fit is @xmath71 this is the clearest demonstration of such a correlation for red giants , though past mg  ii observations from iue",
    "have also suggested a trend of this nature @xcite .",
    "there is some ambiguity with regards to whether the optical spectra of ca  ii h & k wind absorption support a wind velocity correlation with spectral type .",
    "the wind velocities quoted by @xcite would seem to suggest lower velocities for m giants , but inferences of terminal velocities from the ca  ii data are open to interpretation . at least within the m giants alone , which are the only class iii stars with reliably deep , saturated wind absorption , the centroid velocity of the ca  ii absorption decreases towards later spectral types but the blueward extent of the absorption does not , leading to the early interpretation that these variations are indicative of changes in line formation depth and turbulent velocity with spectral type rather than any change in wind velocity @xcite .",
    "the very presence of ca  ii wind absorption implies that the stellar wind must be relatively cold close to the star .",
    "we can further explore the comparison of ca  ii and mg  ii wind diagnostics using more recent ca  ii observations , specifically spectra taken at a very high resolution of @xmath72 with the coude cross - dispersed spectrometer ( cs21 ) on the 2.7-meter harlan j.  smith telecope at mcdonald observatory . in 2006",
    "january , eight k0-m5 evolved stars were observed : @xmath45  gem ( k0  iii ) , @xmath6  boo ( k2  iii ) , @xmath45  umi ( k4  iii ) , @xmath6  tau ( k5  iii ) , @xmath45  and ( m0  iii ) , @xmath6  cet ( m1.5  iii ) , @xmath45  peg ( m2.5 ii - iii ) , and @xmath6  her  a ( m5  ii ) .",
    "the spectral type range covered resembles our hst red giant sample , although the last two stars drift out of luminosity class iii .",
    "figure  3 shows the resulting spectra of the ca  ii k line .",
    "analogous to figure  1 , @xmath45  gem is used in figure  3 to indicate what the ca  ii line profile looks like for a coronal star without a strong chromospheric wind , and as for mg  ii , the line profile is double - peaked , with a stronger blue peak .",
    "all of the other ca  ii k lines in figure  3 have stronger red peaks , suggesting the presence of a wind . however , the latest type stars , @xmath45  peg and @xmath6  her  a , are the only ones that exhibit deep , saturated ca  ii wind absorption profiles .",
    "the wind signatures are more subtle for the earlier type stars .",
    "the @xmath6  boo and @xmath45  umi ca  ii profiles are very similar to the mg  ii profiles of hd  66141 and @xmath6  tuc ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath6  boo , which has strong and deep mg  ii wind absorption in figure  1 , does not exhibit analogously strong ca  ii absorption in figure  3 .",
    "several of the stars ( @xmath6  tau , @xmath45  and , @xmath6  cet , and perhaps @xmath45  umi ) show relatively narrow , weak ca  ii absorption between @xmath73 and @xmath74 km  s@xmath2 that should be indicative of the stellar wind s terminal speed .",
    "these features resemble the narrow mg  ii absorption seen in figure  1 for @xmath5  dra , albeit not at nearly as high a velocity .",
    "the @xmath73 to @xmath74 km  s@xmath2 range of velocities is comparable to the wind speeds inferred from mg  ii .",
    "however , it is worth noting that for @xmath6  tau , we inferred @xmath75 km  s@xmath2 from mg  ii , while the @xmath6  tau ca  ii absorption in figure  3 would suggest a lower value of @xmath76 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is likely due to actual variability in the wind of @xmath6  tau .",
    "the variability of the ca  ii wind absorption seen from @xmath6  tau has long been established @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite found the wind velocity inferred from ca  ii wind absorption to increase from 20.9 to 28.0 km  s@xmath2 between 2005 september and 2007 march .",
    "based on the @xmath6  tau example , astrospheric mg  ii absorption should be weak , narrow , and slightly blueshifted from the stellar rest frame .",
    "only two of the other stars in our sample , @xmath4  pup and @xmath5  eri , show absorption of this nature ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we not only look for astrospheric absorption in the mg  ii lines , but also in other lines within our hst spectra in which it might be observed , particularly the o  i line at 1302.2   , c  ii at 1334.5   , and fe  ii at 2600.2   , which all have line profiles similar to mg  ii , with the deep wind absorption trough .",
    "for @xmath5  eri we find a marginal detection of fe  ii absorption , while for @xmath4  pup we find more convincing detections for both fe  ii and c  ii . given that for @xmath6  tau",
    "the absorption signature was only seen in mg  ii , these are the first detections of the astrospheric absorption signature in any line but mg  ii . figure  4 displays all astrospheric absorption lines detected to date , for all three red giants with detected astrospheres .",
    ".astrospheric absorption line measurements [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have fitted these absorption features with single absorption lines , analyzing them in the same fashion as ism absorption lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "required oscillator absorption strengths are taken from @xcite .",
    "each absorption component is defined by three parameters : central velocity ( @xmath77 ) , doppler broadening parameter ( @xmath78 ) , and column density ( @xmath79 ) . to constrain the fit as much as possible ,",
    "the two mg  ii lines are fitted simultaneously , with self - consistent fit parameters .",
    "the resulting fits to the data are shown in figure  4 , taking into account instrumental broadening using line spread functions from @xcite .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in table  2 .",
    "the column densities , with units of @xmath40 , are listed in logarithmic form .",
    "the fe  ii and c  ii data are noisy , and the c  ii line is not well resolved in the e140 m spectrum . as a consequence , uncertainties in the fe  ii and c  ii fit parameters",
    "are large .",
    "the velocities of the astrospheric absorption listed in table  2 indicate the post - ts velocity , after being subtracted from @xmath18 to place them in the proper stellar rest frame .",
    "the @xmath0 velocities in table  1 are the pre - ts velocities .",
    "the ratio of the two is a measure of the compression ratio ( @xmath80 ) of the ts .",
    "mathematically , @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath80 values of the three detected astrospheres are listed in table  2 .    assuming the absorption line widths are dominated by thermal broadening , the doppler parameters ( in km  s@xmath2 ) will be related to temperature by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the atomic weight of the species in question .",
    "the last column of table  2 lists temperatures computed from this equation using the mg  ii doppler parameters ( with @xmath84 ) .",
    "if the ts is radiative , some of the astrospheric absorption may be coming from the intermediate radiative relaxation zone of the shock , rather than being entirely from post - ts material that has reached its final flow velocity and temperature .",
    "the effects of velocity gradients in this region would be to broaden the absorption line and shift the line centroid blueward of the true terminal post - ts velocity .",
    "this would mean that @xmath80 in table  2 could actually be an underestimate and t an overestimate .",
    "however , velocity gradients in the relaxation region should also induce asymmetries in the absorption profiles , for which we do not see any evidence , which is an argument in favor of the absorption being dominated by post - relaxation zone material .    at the ts ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the stellar wind is partly converted to thermal energy in the post - ts material .",
    "thus , there should be a correlation between @xmath0 and the temperatures listed in table  2",
    ". we can be more specific using the conservation of momentum equation of the rankine - hugoniot shock jump relations , which says @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 are the pressure , density , and velocity upstream of the shock ; and @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 are the corresponding quantities downstream",
    ". an mhd version of equation ( 3 ) would include @xmath92 terms , but such terms should not be significant here . in the strong shock limit appropriate here ,",
    "@xmath86 is negligible and @xmath93 for a simple hydrodynamic shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , equation ( 3 ) reduces to @xmath94 the post - ts pressure and temperature are related by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath97 the number density . for a pure hydrogen fluid , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the proton mass . plugging these relations into equation ( 4 ) and noting that @xmath100 leads to @xmath101 if @xmath88 is in km  s@xmath2 units .    in figure  5",
    ", we plot this expected relation between stellar wind speed and post - ts temperature , which is compared with the actual measurements for the three detected astrospheres .",
    "we do see an increase in temperature with @xmath0 , but the measured temperatures are lower than predicted .",
    "the explanation for the discrepancy lies in the assumption of a simple hydrodynamic shock in deriving equation ( 5 ) , which requires @xmath102 in the strong shock limit .",
    "however , from table  2 we already know @xmath103 for all three detected astrospheres .",
    "this is evidence for a dissipative shock , as suggested before for @xmath6  tau , where the astrospheric absorption could only be reproduced when the ts was modeled as a radiative shock @xcite .",
    "the dashed line is representative of the initial post - ts temperature , but radiative cooling decreases this temperature , resulting in additional compression .",
    "it is worth noting that the star with the lowest @xmath80 , @xmath5  eri , is not surprisingly closest to the expected temperature in figure  5 . for @xmath5  eri ,",
    "less radiative cooling and associated compression is necessary to reach the observed temperature .",
    "this is explored further with a full hydrodynamic model of the @xmath5  eri astrosphere in the next section .    a final question to address in this section concerns the issue of why only three of the red giant targets in table  1 show the astrospheric absorption signature .",
    "the @xmath26 values of the three archival nondetections ( @xmath6  boo , @xmath5  dra , and @xmath5  cru ) demonstrate that we are not looking through the astrotail , and therefore we may not have sufficient mg  ii column densities along the lines of sight to these stars to detect astrospheric absorption .",
    "this , however , is not true for the 7 new targets that did not yield detections .",
    "one problem for the three m3-m5 giants in that list ( @xmath30  gem , @xmath32  eri , and hd  120323 ) is that there is very little flux near the stellar rest frame to provide a suitable background for the astrospheric signature , making it harder to detect .",
    "this is presumably due to a combination of low wind speed and high mass loss rate . as discussed above with regards to @xmath5  eri",
    ", the low wind speed also reduces the heating at the ts , thereby reducing radiative cooling and post - ts compression , which also reduces astrospheric detectability .",
    "three of the k2-k4 giants among the nondetections ( hd  66141 , @xmath6  tuc , and hd  87837 ) have winds weak enough that there is no deep , broad wind absorption feature in the mg  ii lines .",
    "perhaps for these stars the winds are not strong enough to carve out astrospheres that are sufficiently large to yield enough post - ts mg  ii column density for an astrospheric absorption detection .",
    "this does not explain the @xmath26  cma nondetection , though .",
    "the @xmath26  cma nondetection is the hardest to explain , as there is strong wind absorption in the mg  ii profiles , there is plenty of flux near the stellar rest frame to provide background for the astrospheric signature , and the @xmath0 and @xmath26 values for the star are both large enough to expect a detection . in any case ,",
    "given that only 2 of the 9 stars in our new survey yielded astrospheric detections , despite an effort to choose targets likely to provide detections , it is clear that detectable astrospheric absorption signatures are the exception and not the rule for red giants , even in high quality spectra .",
    "we compute a hydrodynamic model of the @xmath5  eri astrosphere in much the same manner as we modeled the @xmath6  tau astrosphere @xcite .",
    "this is a two - fluid model of a type used to model the heliosphere , in which the plasma and neutrals are treated as two separate , distinct fluids that are allowed to interact through charge exchange processes @xcite .",
    "a first step in the modeling process is to define the boundary conditions for the model , specifically the stellar wind boundary conditions at 1  au from the star , and the parameters for the surrounding ism .    for the stellar wind , we model the mg  ii wind absorption feature using techniques used in the past @xcite , leading to a mass loss rate estimate of @xmath104 m@xmath8  yr@xmath2 and a terminal velocity of @xmath105 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "these values can be used to infer densities at 1  au from the star , representing the inner boundary condition of the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the model only considers hydrogen , expected to be the dominant constituent by number and mass .",
    "the ionization state of hydrogen is very uncertain .",
    "it is expected to be mostly neutral at the @xmath9  k temperature of the wind , but some degree of ionization may be present . we assume a 10% ionization .",
    "we assume a temperature of 7500  k for the wind at 1  au , though this is actually an unimportant parameter given that the flow is very supersonic .",
    "turning to the interstellar boundary conditions , the ism flow velocity and direction represented by the @xmath23 and @xmath26 values from table  1 are necessary constraints . as for density and temperature appropriate for hot lb plasma",
    ", we assume a temperature and proton density of @xmath106  k and @xmath107 @xmath108 , respectively , as assumed for model  8 of the @xmath6  tau astrosphere from @xcite .",
    "there are small , partly neutral clouds within the lb , including the lic surrounding the sun , but we assume @xmath5  eri will be surrounded by the more typical hot lb plasma .    figure  6 shows the resulting hydrodynamic model of @xmath5  eri .",
    "the figure shows maps of temperature and density .",
    "the stellar wind expands radially from the star until it hits the roughly circular ts , at a distance of about 350  au in the upwind direction and about 550  au in the downwind direction .",
    "the ts is seen most clearly in the density plot in figure  6 .",
    "the heated , compressed , and decelerated post - ts wind material is partly deflected downwind towards the astrotail , separated from the plasma flow of the ism by a parabola - shaped `` astropause '' ( analogous to the heliopause ) , although the large mean free path of the neutrals allows them to cross this boundary and create the halo of neutrals around it , in green in the density plot of figure  6 .",
    "unlike most heliospheric models , the ism flow does not pass through a bow shock , as the ism flow is not supersonic due to the high temperature of the assumed lb plasma .",
    "figure  7 shows the traces of h  i density , temperature , and velocity along our @xmath109 line of sight to @xmath5  eri .",
    "the locations of the ts and astropause in this direction are noted .",
    "it is the post - ts material in between the ts and astropause that will be responsible for the astrospheric mg  ii absorption feature , as that is where the density is highest .",
    "computing mg  ii absorption from the hydrogen parameters in figure  7 requires that we assume that mg  ii is the dominant ionization state of mg , and we assume a solar mg abundance @xcite .    the mg  ii absorption predicted by the model",
    "is compared with the data in figure  8a .",
    "the model significantly underpredicts the amount of absorption , to the extent that it is difficult to see the difference between the predicted absorption and the assumed background flux above the absorption .",
    "thus , figure  8b shows a different version of this plot , showing the opacity across the line profile .",
    "the model is quite successful in predicting the location and width of the absorption , and if the line opacity is arbitrarily increased by a factor of 8 , the predicted absorption actually fits the data reasonably well .",
    "the model in figure  6 is actually more successful in reproducing the observed astrospheric absorption than the hydrodynamic @xmath6  tau models , most of which underpredicted the amount of absorption even more severely , and all of which placed the absorption much too far from the stellar rest frame . treating the @xmath6  tau ts as a radiative shock was necessary to increase the amount of absorption and to shift it closer to the stellar rest frame , although even with the radiative shock treatment there was still difficulty predicting a sufficient amount of absorption @xcite .    for @xmath5  eri , the predicted absorption is slightly blueshifted from its observed location , but not by much .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath110 value reported in table  2 , which indicates a compression ratio slightly higher that the @xmath102 value of a strong , hydrodynamic shock , but not by very much , unlike @xmath6  tau .",
    "the need to include radiative cooling is therefore much reduced for @xmath5  eri . including radiative cooling in the @xmath5  eri model , which we will not try here , would presumably improve agreement with the data somewhat , but it is unlikely to be the main reason the model is greatly underestimating the amount of absorption , considering that @xmath80 is not too much higher than 4 for @xmath5  eri .",
    "two other possible reasons for the absorption underestimate that are worth considering are : 1 .",
    "our assumed mg abundance in the stellar wind is too low , and 2 .",
    "the ism pressure that we are assuming may be too low .",
    "as for the first explanation , we are not aware of any precise measurement of a photospheric mg abundance for @xmath5  eri , but even if such a measurement did exist , the mg abundance in the stellar wind could be different .",
    "even in the solar wind , the abundances of elements with low first ionization potential can be higher than photospheric abundances by a factor of 4 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is plausible that simply assuming a solar photospheric mg abundance as we have could be a significant underestimate .",
    "as for the second suggestion , the effects of a high ism pressure on astrospheric absorption were explored at length in the analysis of the @xmath6  tau astrosphere @xcite .",
    "increasing the ism density pushes the ts closer to the star , where wind densities are higher , leading to the post - ts densities being higher , thereby producing more absorption .",
    "in contrast , the amount of astrospheric absorption was unaffected by increases in stellar wind density , because the wind density increase was offset by the effect of pushing the ts farther from the star , where densities are lower .",
    "the astrospheric absorption features are therefore potentially useful as ism pressure diagnostics .",
    "the ism pressure that we are assuming in the @xmath5  eri model ( @xmath111 @xmath108  k ) is consistent with measurements of pressures of neutral clouds within the lb @xcite , but it may be a little low based on recent assessments of hot plasma within the lb , which suggest @xmath112 @xmath108  k @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that an underestimate of the ism pressure could be part of the explanation for the underestimate of astrospheric absorption .",
    "interpretations of @xmath4  pup s mg  ii lines and attempts to model its wind and astrosphere are complicated by its binarity . as noted in section  2",
    ", the k5  iii giant has a g5  v companion , with an orbital period of 257.8  days .",
    "the half - amplitude of the orbital motion is @xmath113 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the wind speed , so the orbital motion will impart a significant increase in this speed in the direction of orbital motion , and a corresponding decrease in speed in the opposite direction . during the course of one 257.8  day orbit the @xmath114 km  s@xmath2 stellar wind would travel about 6.5  au , or about 32 stellar radii .",
    "the region around the binary on these distance scales will involve a complex merger of high speed and slow speed streams , with uncertain consequences for the effective final terminal wind speed , although it is expected that the high and slow speed streams will have merged into a more homogeneous outflow before the ts is reached at a distance of @xmath115  au .",
    "thus , the systemic center - of - mass velocity quoted as @xmath18 in table  1 ( @xmath116 km  s@xmath2 ) is definitely a better reference velocity to use when computing the post - ts velocity and @xmath80 than the actual stellar radial velocity at the time of the observation , which inspection of narrow h@xmath117 lines in the e140 m spectrum suggests is @xmath118 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the observed astrospheric absorption is certainly close to the former and not the latter .",
    "more questionable is our use of @xmath116 km  s@xmath2 as the reference velocity for computing @xmath0 .",
    "which @xmath18 value is appropriate for estimating @xmath0 depends on whether the wind absorption feature is entirely from the part of the wind close to the star and moving with the star , or whether there is absorption from material farther from the star emitted when the star had a different radial velocity . by assuming @xmath116 km  s@xmath2 we are implicitly assuming the latter , but the former is quite possible .",
    "if @xmath118 km  s@xmath2 is more appropriate , our @xmath0 estimate would increase to @xmath119 , which would make @xmath4  pup look discrepant in figure  2c , albeit still not as discrepant as @xmath5  dra .",
    "if @xmath4  pup s mg  ii lines could be monitored over the course of an orbit , we could see if the stellar wind absorption precisely follows the star or not , thereby resolving this particular issue .",
    "such monitoring has been done in the optical for the ca  ii lines of the spectroscopic binary @xmath30  uma ( m0  iii+ ? ) , with a 230 day period , where it is found that the wind absorption does not seem to follow the radial velocity shifts of the red giant primary @xcite .",
    "this supports our use of the systemic @xmath116 km  s@xmath2 value as the reference velocity in computing @xmath0 , instead of @xmath118 km  s@xmath2 .    a final complicating factor that should be mentioned concerns the presence of the g5  v companion star , which will be embedded within the wind emitted by the red giant .",
    "gravitational effects on the relatively slow red giant wind could possibly be significant , as could interactions between the winds of the two stars .",
    "if the companion star s wind is like that of the sun , it may be too weak compared with the massive red giant wind to have any effect on the red giant wind , but this is far from certain . in any case , with all these complications in mind , we choose not to compute a @xmath4  pup astrospheric model at this time .",
    "we have analyzed the chromospheric mg  ii h & k lines of k2-m5  iii stars observed by hst , consisting of 9 observations obtained as part of a new hst red giant survey , and 4 archival targets .",
    "our findings are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the mg  ii line profiles of all 13 stars in our sample show evidence for stellar wind absorption , but for three of the k2-k4  iii stars the effect is only an induced asymmetry in the line profile rather than a deep wind absorption feature .",
    "2 .   measured mg  ii surface fluxes are very tightly correlated with spectral type and photospheric temperature , consistent with the idea that k2-m5  iii stars redward of the coronal dividing line are all emitting at a basal flux level .",
    "the mg  ii k / h flux ratio increases towards later spectral types .",
    "wind speeds estimated empirically from the mg  ii spectra correlate with spectral type and photospheric temperature , with @xmath0 decreasing from @xmath120 km  s@xmath2 at k2  iii to @xmath121 km  s@xmath2 at m5  iii .",
    "4 .   there are 2 new detections of astrospheric absorption among the recently observed stars ( @xmath5  eri and @xmath4  pup ) , for a total of 3 in our sample , including the previous detection towards @xmath6  tau .",
    "however , the limited number of new detections indicates that detectable astrospheric absorption in uv lines is not a common phenomenon . for both @xmath5  eri and @xmath4  pup",
    "we detect astrospheric fe  ii @xmath672600.2 absorption in addition to the mg  ii signature , and for @xmath4  pup , astrospheric absorption is also observed in c  ii @xmath671334.5 .",
    "these are the first detections of red giant astrospheres in lines other than mg  ii .",
    "analysis of the astrospheric absorption leads to measurements of ts compression ratio and post - ts temperature for the three detected astrospheres .",
    "the temperatures are correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "however , the @xmath122  k post - ts temperatures are too low and the @xmath123 compression ratios too high according to the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions , providing further evidence that red giant termination shocks are radiative shocks rather than simple hydrodynamic shocks .",
    "we compute a hydrodynamic model of the @xmath5  eri astrosphere , which is the one with the ts compression ratio ( @xmath110 ) closest to the strong hydrodynamic shock value of @xmath102 . not surprisingly , this model has less difficulty reproducing the observed absorption than was the case for a past study of the @xmath6  tau astrosphere @xcite , for which @xmath124 .",
    "the @xmath5  eri model places the absorption at about the right velocity and with about the correct width , but it underpredicts the mg  ii opacity by a factor of 8 .",
    "this might be due to either an underestimate of the mg abundance in the stellar wind , or an underestimate of the ism pressure surrounding the star .",

    "<S> we report on an ultraviolet spectroscopic survey of red giants observed by the _ hubble space telescope _ , focusing on spectra of the mg  ii h & k lines near 2800    in order to study stellar chromospheric emission , winds , and astrospheric absorption . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on spectral types between k2  iii and m5  iii , a spectral type range with stars that are noncoronal , but possessing strong , chromospheric winds . </S>",
    "<S> we find a very tight relation between mg  ii surface flux and photospheric temperature , supporting the notion that all k2-m5  iii stars are emitting at a basal flux level . </S>",
    "<S> wind velocities ( @xmath0 ) are generally found to decrease with spectral type , with @xmath0 decreasing from @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 at k2  iii to @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 at m5  iii . </S>",
    "<S> we find two new detections of astrospheric absorption , for @xmath4  pup ( k5  iii ) and @xmath5  eri ( m1  iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> this absorption signature had previously only been detected for @xmath6  tau ( k5  iii ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the three astrospheric detections the temperature of the wind after the termination shock correlates with @xmath0 , but is lower than predicted by the rankine - hugoniot shock jump conditions , consistent with the idea that red giant termination shocks are radiative shocks rather than simple hydrodynamic shocks . a full hydrodynamic simulation of the @xmath5  eri astrosphere </S>",
    "<S> is provided to explore this further . </S>"
