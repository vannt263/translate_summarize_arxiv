    "since photons do not interact strongly , direct photons are a powerful probe to study the initial state of matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "they are emitted from all the states such as the initial state , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , and the final hadron - gas state .",
    "in addition , it is predicted that the contribution of photons from jet - photon conversion in the dense medium can be as large as the photon yield from hard scatterings  @xcite .    in the 2004 run ,",
    "phenix recorded a high - statistics au+au data set .",
    "the new data set allows us to measure direct photons beyond the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) of 10  gev/@xmath1 and also more precisely than before at intermediate @xmath3 where thermal photons and photons from jet - plasma interactions are important .",
    "the phenix experiment can measure photons with two types of highly segmented electromagnetic calorimeters  ( emcal )  @xcite .",
    "one is a lead scintillator sampling calorimeter  ( pbsc ) , and another is a lead glass cherenkov calorimeter  ( pbgl ) .",
    "measurement of direct photons is challenging because there is a large amount of background from decay of neutral mesons such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is estimated that the @xmath6 would be @xmath7 10  % at the @xmath3 range of 2 - 4  gev/@xmath1 , where thermal photon is expected to be dominant  @xcite . in order to extract direct photon signal ,",
    "conventional subtraction method has been used . @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "mesons are reconstructed via their two - photon decay mode .",
    "the @xmath3 spectra of direct photons are obtained by subtracting the spectra of decay photons estimated based on the measured @xmath4/@xmath5 from the @xmath3 spectra of inclusive photons .",
    "in addition to the conventional subtraction method , the analysis was carried out using a new method where real direct photons are measured by their virtual counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the idea is that all sources of real photons also produce virtual photons that decay into @xmath2 pairs with small invariant masses .",
    "the invariant mass distribution of @xmath2 pairs from virtual photons can be given by knoll - wada formula  @xcite for each virtual photon sources , such as direct photon , @xmath4 dalitz and @xmath5 dalitz .",
    "the ratio of direct photons was obtained using the ratio of photon yield in different @xmath2 invariant mass region .",
    "compared to the conventional subtraction measurement , the new technique ( internal conversion method ) improves both the signal - to - background ratio and the energy resolution at intermediate @xmath3 .",
    "an excess of the signal over background has been seen as the red points of left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : midpt ] , which is consistent with the result of conventional subtraction method within the error .",
    "= 360  mev ) predictions.,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]   = 360  mev ) predictions.,title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : midpt ] shows the direct photon spectrum which is obtained from the excess ratio measured with internal conversion method and inclusive photon spectrum measured with emcal .",
    "the spectrum shows the enhancement comparing with the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculation scaled by the au+au nuclear overlapping function  ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions at an impact parameter @xmath12 with an inelastic cross section  @xmath13 . a hydrodynamical prediction which computes the thermal photon emission from a qgp with initial temperatures @xmath14 = 360  mev  @xcite supports the observed enhancement of the spectrum .",
    "however , the reference baseline in those calculations is the @xmath8-scaled nlo pqcd photon spectrum . to confirm the existence of a thermal enhancement",
    ", it is necessary to directly measure the p+p direct photon spectrum in the @xmath3 = 1  4  gev/@xmath1 range .",
    "in contrast to the measurement of mid-@xmath3 direct photon , the strong suppression of neutral hadrons by a jet - quenching effect in heavy ion collisions  @xcite allows to extract direct photons at the momentum region of @xmath15 5  gev/@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : highpt ] shows the direct photon excess ratio as a function of @xmath3 in most central events  ( 0 - 10% ) .",
    "the ratio is in good agreement with a nlo pqcd calculation  @xcite scaled by @xmath8 within the error and theoretical uncertainty .",
    "this suggests that the initial - hard - scattering probability is not reduced .",
    "the direct photon excess ratio measured by pbsc - emcal slightly deviates from the nlo pqcd calculation above 14  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "the deviation may support that the compensation of jet - quenching and additional photons by a nuclear effect , such as jet - photon conversion , is breaking up above 14  gev/@xmath1 . because the direct photon calculated with pqcd consists of the prompt photon produced from the hard scattering directly and the jet fragmentation photons coming from hard - scattered partons ,",
    "the direct photon yield measured in au+au collisions is naively expected to be suppressed comparing with nlo pqcd calculation scaled by @xmath8 . the agreement with scaled nlo pqcd calculations",
    "might just be a coincidence caused by mutually counterbalancing effects like energy loss and compton like scattering of jet partons  @xcite . in order to conclude that the deviation attributes to the such nuclear effect , it is important to measure high-@xmath3 direct photon in p+p system and to observe the deviation with pbgl - emcal as well .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : highpt ] shows the fully corrected direct photon invariant yield as a function of @xmath3 for each centrality .",
    "the spectra are combined results of pbsc measurement and pbgl measurement .",
    "the yields are in good agreement with @xmath8-scaled nlo pqcd calculation up to 14  gev/@xmath1 .     measured with subtraction method .",
