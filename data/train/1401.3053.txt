    "in multiferroic materials such as @xmath10mno@xmath11 ( r : rare earths ) @xcite , ni@xmath11v@xmath12o@xmath13@xcite , and mnwo@xmath1@xcite , ferroelectricity is believed to be driven by magnetism because it emerges simultaneously with a spiral magnetic order upon cooling .",
    "these materials are known as `` type - ii '' multiferroics,@xcite and their ferroelectricity as `` improper.''@xcite even though such multiferroicity has to date been found only at low temperatures , it has attracted very significant research interest due to the possibilities it offers for tunable multiferroic devices .",
    "phenomenologically , the breaking of magnetic inversion symmetry and strong dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions are believed to be essential ingredients for understanding the coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism.@xcite theoretically , inversion symmetry - breaking is thought to be caused by strong magnetic frustration .",
    "experimentally , while magnetic frustration is certainly suggested by the available susceptibility data,@xcite the coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism has been difficult to quantify , and more spectroscopic studies are required to confirm its existence and explore its origin .",

    "neutron scattering studies of polycrystal powders@xcite indicate a collinear incommensurate antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order below @xmath18 22 k and a non - collinear incommensurate , or spiral , afm order below @xmath19 15 k. ferroelectricity occurs only below @xmath20 , a result found also in other type - ii multiferroic materials.@xcite to date , however , most studies of fevo@xmath1 have focused on this ferroelectricity,@xcite and there has been only limited investigation of its magnetic states and their relation to frustration . the availability of fevo@xmath1 as high - quality single crystals makes it an excellent target material for nmr studies of its magnetic properties and of their coupling with ferroelectricity .",
    "nmr is a low - energy , local probe , which is in principle an ideal tool for the study of multiferroics .",
    "it is sensitive both to ferroelectricity , through the coupling between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradient ( efg ) , and to magnetism , through the hyperfine coupling between the nuclei and the magnetic moments . in fevo@xmath1 , however , only the @xmath0v signal could be observed within our available nmr window and the weak quadrupole moment ( @xmath21 barns ) of this nucleus makes the coupling to the efg too weak to be detected . therefore we focus primarily on the low - energy magnetic properties , which reveal strong magnetic frustration in this system , and thus also provide essential information for understanding the nature of multiferroicity .    in this paper",
    "we present all of the information about magnetism in fevo@xmath1 that can be deduced from @xmath0v nmr .",
    "the high - temperature spectrum is single - peaked in the paramagnetic phase , where the knight shift , like the susceptibility , follows a curie - weiss form with a large weiss constant .",
    "on cooling below 65 k , the spectrum splits into two peaks , which indicates a local symmetry - breaking effect on the nmr time scale , or the onset of short - range magnetic order far above the magnetic transition . from the spin - lattice relaxation time",
    "we identify the two magnetic transitions at @xmath9 = 19 k and @xmath22 13 k , consistent with other results reported on single crystals , but lower than those for powder samples .",
    "below @xmath20 , we find a spectrum with no applied field , which reflects a complicated distribution of hyperfine fields transferred from the incommensurate magnetic moments of the fe ions .",
    "however , the upper bound for the ordered moment is only 1.95@xmath7/fe , far less than the paramagnetic local moment , while the temperature dependence of @xmath4 below @xmath20 suggests strong low - energy spin fluctuation effects .",

    "[ struc1 ] and the crystal alignment , required for nmr , was determined by von laue measurements .",
    "the complete @xmath0v nmr spectra were measured by field sweeps of the spin - echo signal , using a fixed frequency of 111.7 mhz and sweeping the magnetic field with its orientation parallel to the ( 0 1 -1 ) plane of the crystal .",
    "the spin - echo pulse sequence was @xmath27 , with @xmath28 @xmath29s and respective @xmath30 and @xmath31 pulse lengths of 2.5 and 4 @xmath29s .",
    "the knight shift was determined in the paramagnetic state from @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the resonance frequency , @xmath34 is the applied field , and @xmath35 = 11.197 mhz / t is the @xmath0v gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath36 was measured by the spin - inversion method , and the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath37 from the spin echoes , both of which were found to follow standard , single - exponential spin recovery / decay functions .",
    "two comments are in order on the @xmath0v spectrum at @xmath38 = 140 k , shown in fig .",
    "[ spec2](a ) , which has a finite knight shift @xmath39 .",
    "first , from the triclinic crystal structure shown in fig .  [ struc1 ] , three @xmath0v resonance peaks are expected .",
    "each unit cell in fevo@xmath1 contains three pairs of non - identical v@xmath16 sites , each linked by lattice inversion symmetry and labeled by v1 , v2 , and v3 .",
    "all three types of site have different bond lengths to all of their neighboring o@xmath17 and fe@xmath15 ions , and therefore should appear as separate peaks .",
    "however , in our data only one of the three site pairs is detected within the nmr window . as we will show in sec .",
    "iii , the spin - spin relaxation time @xmath40 of our signal is very short ( less than 50 @xmath29s ) due to the dominance of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "thus we believe our inability to observe the other two @xmath0v pairs arises because these sites have a stronger hyperfine coupling and therefore even shorter @xmath40 times , which move the corresponding signals out of our measurement window .",
    "second , we did not find measurable quadrupolar effects on the resonance frequency , which is reasonable for the center site of the local vo@xmath1 tetrahedra and for the low quadrupole moment of @xmath0v .",

    "we begin our investigation of the nmr response of fevo@xmath1 single crystals by considering the high - field @xmath0v spectra at elevated temperatures .",

    "[ spec2](a ) . between 140 k and 80 k",
    "they show a single peak at a field of 9.66 t , which is a regular paramagnetic signal .",
    "as we decrease the temperature to 1.5 k , it is clear that the line shape , line width , and peak frequency change dramatically , reflecting a rich variety of magnetic properties for a single material .",
    "we note that a spurious @xmath0v signal is also observed at 10.0 t ( @xmath43 ) , which has a @xmath44 value more than three orders of magnitude higher than the other peaks and does not sense the magnetic transitions on cooling , and thus is probably the consequence of a weak impurity phase or an inclusion of the crystal - growth flux .",
    "a weak and asymmetric shoulder feature at 9.65 t is also visible at temperatures between 40 and 80 k before being lost as the spectrum broadens , and this may reflect some dilute local disorder .    figure [ spec2](a ) shows representative spectra in all of the different magnetic phases of fevo@xmath1 . below a temperature",
    "@xmath45 k , the @xmath0v spectrum broadens and develops a prominent double - peak feature suggestive of strong spin correlations , or short - range magnetic order on the nmr time scale ; we discuss this interpretation in detail below .",
    "the spectra at 15 k and at 1.5 k show such significant broadening that they again appear to have a single peak .",
    "this form is typical for systems with spatially inhomogeneous magnetic order when subject to an applied field , because the nuclei respond to both the external field and the varying internal field in the crystal .",

    "we show results for both quantities , measured for each temperature at the peak positions on the low - field side of the spectra [ red arrows in fig .",
    "[ spec2](a ) ] ; below @xmath20 , @xmath4 is lowest at the peak frequency and increases by approximately @xmath46 across the frequency range . the temperature dependence of @xmath4 , shown in fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) , first displays a slow decrease with temperature upon cooling below 100 k. however , there is a prominent increase below 30 k leading to a peak at 19 k , which indicates the first magnetic phase transition at @xmath9 . upon further cooling ,",
    "@xmath4 decreases again , although a small second peak is resolvable at @xmath47 k , indicating the second magnetic transition ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "both transitions can also be resolved in the @xmath41 data , also shown in fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) , where @xmath41 exhibits the same behavior as @xmath4 ; two peaks in the relaxation rate are clearly formed at the two magnetic transition temperatures @xmath48 k and @xmath49 k. while @xmath23 in a magnetic system is expected to be controlled by spin fluctuations , this is in general not so clear for @xmath24 .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath41 peaks at the transitions and shows a temperature dependence so similar to that of @xmath4 indicates that @xmath41 is indeed dominated by the magnetic fluctuations in fevo@xmath1 .",
    "we comment again here that the @xmath37 values shown in fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) are very short ( under 50 @xmath29s over much of the temperature range ) , a result we ascribe to these very strong magnetic fluctuations and which we believe prevents our detection of the other two v site pairs ( sec .",

    "as the temperature is lowered from 30 k to @xmath9 , @xmath51 decreases strongly due to the combination of inhomogeneous line - width broadening [ fig .",

    "[ t1vst3](a ) ] .",
    "in fact @xmath55s is very short at @xmath9 [ fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) ] because of the strong magnetic fluctuations , and this causes a large signal loss in our spin - echo measurements .",
    "the rise in echo intensity below @xmath9 is caused by the fall in @xmath41 [ fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) ] .",
    "however , the increase below @xmath20 [ fig .  [ t1vst3](b ) ] occurs despite the strong spectral broadening at these temperatures [ fig .",
    "[ spec2](b ) ] and can not be explained by @xmath40 effects alone . while the kink directly below @xmath20 is caused by the sharp fall in @xmath41 [ fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) ] , the continued increase in echo intensity at low temperatures , once @xmath40 is very long again , is due to rf enhancement of the nmr signal .",
    "this phenomenon is typical in ordered magnetic systems and has also been reported in multiferroic materials such as tbmn@xmath12o@xmath26;@xcite in this compound it shows a hysteresis effect at high fields that the authors proposed may originate in a coupling between the afm domain walls and ferroelectric domain walls . in fevo@xmath1 we do not find evidence for hysteresis effects , and we suggest that the rf enhancement below @xmath20 is intrinsic in a spiral magnet .",

    "the knight shift measures the spin susceptibility of the system , and so the monotonic increase of @xmath25 on cooling is consistent with paramagnetic behavior .",
    "in fact @xmath58 can be fitted very well by a curie - weiss form , @xmath59 , with the weiss constant @xmath60 k ; the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ knvst4](a ) . in the inset",
    "we show @xmath25 against the dc susceptibility ( adapted from ref .  ) with temperature as the implicit parameter , from which we estimate the hyperfine coupling constant to be @xmath61 koe/@xmath62 .",
    "values of @xmath63 reported in the literature show some considerable variation , with curie - weiss fits to susceptibility data from polycrystals giving @xmath64 125 k@xcite and from single - crystal measurements giving @xmath3 97 k.@xcite this spread of results may reflect an important role for domain - wall effects , a topic to which we return below .",
    "two incontrovertible statements are that our measurements are fully consistent with previous studies and that they are consistent with @xmath65 .",
    "such a large value of @xmath63 compared to @xmath9 is typical for a number of type - ii multiferroic systems,@xcite and is a key piece of evidence for strong magnetic frustration .",
    "we turn next to the double - peak feature in the spectrum at temperatures between @xmath42 and @xmath9 , where the intensities of the two peaks are rather similar and can be fitted rather well by a double - gaussian function [ fig .",

    "@xmath58 in this temperature range deviates both from the high-@xmath38 curie - weiss form and from the high-@xmath38 linear scaling with the bulk susceptibility [ fig .",

    ", the overall line width of the spectral features also broadens significantly below 65 k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spec2](b ) .",
    "we confirmed ( data not shown ) that the splitting of the peaks is proportional to the external field , which indicates a varying local susceptibility rather than any static magnetic ordering .",
    "indeed , such a line - splitting is clearly a local symmetry - breaking effect , and far the most probable interpretation of our data is that the double - peak spectra are caused by strong spin correlations , or equivalently short - range magnetic ordering on the time scale of nmr . in particular",
    ", the hyperfine fields of the two v sites linked by lattice inversion symmetry may be different in this short - range - ordered state , splitting the spectrum into two peaks with equal intensity as observed .",
    "while the splitting we observe could also be caused by a breaking of crystal symmetry , no structural measurements have yet detected such a process at temperatures as high as @xmath42 .",
    "further evidence in favor of a short - range ordering scenario for temperatures @xmath66 in fevo@xmath1 can be found by comparison with the situation when @xmath67 , where the magnetic order is long - ranged and static , magnetic inversion symmetry is broken,@xcite and our zero - field nmr spectrum also resolves a double - peak feature ( below ) .",
    "strong spin correlations or short - ranged magnetic order above @xmath9 in fevo@xmath1 have been also been proposed to interpret specific - heat measurements , where a significant absence of magnetic entropy ( or an `` entropy recovery '' ) is observed over a broad temperature range above @xmath9.@xcite while magnetic heat - capacity measurements are complicated by issues including phonon subtraction , the line splitting and broadening we observe by nmr provide direct evidence for short - range magnetic ordering .",
    "our results also give the first accurate measurement of the onset temperature @xmath42 .",
    "short - range ordering of this type has also been reported by nmr , on the basis of inhomogeneous line - width broadening , in the materials licuvo@xmath1@xcite and lamn(o@xmath68f@xmath69)@xmath11.@xcite the appearance of short - range magnetic order in the paramagnetic state is a first indication of magnetic frustration effects , which are necessary to suppress a static afm order in this regime . the fact that @xmath42 is over three times the size of @xmath9 , making the short - range - ordered region remarkably broad , suggests that frustration is very strong in fevo@xmath1 .",
    "this observation is fully consistent with the magnetic frustration revealed by the large weiss constant in the knight shift .",
    "the tendency towards short - ranged magnetic order may be an important ingredient in explaining the discrepancies between nel temperatures reported in the literature .",
    "the values we obtain from nmr , @xmath48 k and @xmath49 k , are consistent with the magnetization measurements also performed on single crystals.@xcite however , values reported for powder samples@xcite are @xmath70 k and @xmath71 k , respectively 3 k and 2 k higher , which represent a discrepancy well beyond the expected error bars of the individual measurements .",
    "we suggest that the transition temperatures in powder samples can be enhanced both by grain - boundary and domain - wall effects and by strain effects .",
    "given that short - range magnetic ordering already occurs at 65 k , both sets of effects provide a ready source of pinning for fluctuating magnetic moments , particularly when spiral orientations are favored .",
    "strain effects have been found to be very effective in enhancing multiferroic properties in a number of compounds.@xcite    next we discuss the magnetic properties in the ordered phase .",
    "in addition to our high - field nmr studies , we have also performed zero - field nmr measurements to study the magnetic structure in the non - collinear ( spiral ) phase below @xmath20 . in fig .",
    "[ knvst4](b ) we show the zero - field @xmath0v spectrum at 1.5 k , which has a clear double - peak structure with the two maxima centered at @xmath56 ( high - frequency ) and @xmath57 ( low - frequency ) .",
    "the broad spectrum around each peak is caused by the distribution of hyperfine fields on the v sites transferred from the fe moments , all of which are different due to their incommensurate order ( neutron scattering measurements in this phase reveal a spiral magnetic modulation period of approximately 100 nm.@xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of the high - field spectra at @xmath72 k , shown in fig .",
    "[ spec2](b ) , is approximately 8 mhz , which is considerably less than @xmath56 and therefore indicates that the hyperfine field on the v sites is almost perpendicular to the applied external field .",
    "the nmr spectrum in incommensurate magnetically ordered states usually has a characteristic `` double - horn '' feature,@xcite but this is obtained when the applied field is not perpendicular to the internal field .",
    "thus in our present field configuration we are not able to distinguish between an incommensurate spin structure and other forms of modulation that also give rise to a distribution of hyperfine fields , and can state only that our broad line shapes are consistent with the known incommensurate order .",
    "this lack of specificity applies also in the short - range - ordered phase between @xmath9 and @xmath42 , where we can not probe the commensurate or incommensurate nature of the spin fluctuations .",
    "we comment that the incommensurate `` double - horn '' shape is not similar to the double - peak structures we find in either our high - field or zero - field nmr measurements [ figs .",
    "[ spec2](a ) and [ knvst4](b ) ] .",
    "although the spectral intensity is higher at @xmath56 than at @xmath57 , we believe this difference is due primarily to the sensitivity of the nmr pick - up .",
    "this splitting of the spectrum is probably caused by the breaking of inversion symmetry in the hyperfine field on the v sites , similar to the situation we discussed ( on the nmr time scale ) in the short - range - ordered state , and the default expectation would be peaks of equal weight .",
    "we have also measured @xmath56 as a function of temperature , finding [ inset , fig .",
    "[ knvst4](b ) ] that it increases significantly on cooling from 10 k down to 1.5 k , reflecting the development of the ordered moment . by using the value of @xmath73 measured in the paramagnetic phase ,",
    "the high - frequency resonance peak ( @xmath56 ) at zero field sets an upper bound for the ordered moment , of 1.95 @xmath62/fe at @xmath38 = 1.5 k. in the paramagnetic phase , however , the magnetization data give a local moment of 5.83 @xmath62/fe.@xcite thus the ordered moment below @xmath20 is only 1/3 of the net moment , indicating again the effects of strong magnetic frustration even at the lowest temperatures .    below @xmath20 , the temperature dependence of the spin - lattice relaxation rate is different from a conventional antiferromagnet,@xcite where @xmath74 due to relaxation by gapless spin waves , and the temperature dependence is stronger still in the presence of magnetic anisotropy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ t1vst3](a ) , @xmath4 , measured at high field , has power - law behavior below @xmath20 with @xmath75 .",
    "similar unconventional behavior and anomalously slow spin dynamics have been measured in other frustrated magnetic systems , such as volborthite,@xcite where they were ascribed to a very high density of available low - energy excitations .",
    "the low power - law temperature dependence found in fevo@xmath1 would seem to indicate the presence of persistently strong low - energy spin fluctuations on top of the spiral ordered state below @xmath20 .",
    "the small ordered moment and the strong low - energy spin fluctuations in the spiral magnetic phase reflect once again the effects of magnetic frustration in suppressing the ordered moment while enhancing spin fluctuations .",
    "combined with the large weiss constant and the short - range magnetic ordering at high temperatures , fevo@xmath1 shows explicit evidence of strong frustration all across the phase diagram .",
    "magnetic frustration in fevo@xmath1 is clear from the structure shown in fig .",
    "[ struc1 ] , where there are multiple inequivalent fe  o  fe and fe  o  o  fe paths in the system .",
    "these paths give rise to effective magnetic coupling processes , referred to respectively as superexchange and super - superexchange in the structural and magnetic study of ref .  , and it is reasonable to assume that these interactions compete strongly .",
    "our data provide independent evidence reinforcing the presence of strong magnetic frustration in fevo@xmath1 , and by extension its importance for multiferroicity in the form of ferroelectric incommensurate sdw phases .",
    "the origin of magnetically - driven ferroelectricity in improper multiferroics is discussed in ref .  .",
    "unlike the case of proper multiferroics , it does not depend on a `` @xmath76-type '' polar distortion mechanism despite the absence of orbital moments@xcite on both v@xmath16 and fe@xmath15 ( which is @xmath77 ) .",
    "in fact the breaking of magnetic inversion symmetry may in itself not be a sufficient condition , as this is broken at @xmath9 in fevo@xmath1 , i.e.  in the non - ferroelectric collinear incommensurate sdw phase.@xcite instead a genuine spiral magnetic order is required to sustain a polar structure,@xcite with the polarity vector required to lie in the plane of the spiral.@xcite as for the microscopic mechanism responsible for this interaction , the strong coupling between the charge and spin sectors in fevo@xmath1 has been described as a magnetoelastically mediated magnetostriction@xcite and as a magnetoelectric coupling@xcite whose primary origin was proposed to lie in trilinear spin - phonon interactions.@xcite in the magnetic sector , one of the most important terms leading to frustration and incommensurate ordered phases is the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which arises from spin - orbit coupling in non - inversion - symmetric bonding geometries .",
    "these interactions are generic in systems of low crystal symmetry , exactly the situation encountered in fevo@xmath1 , where the triclinic structure has six fe@xmath15 ions ( three structurally inequivalent ) in each unit cell . in combination with superexchange terms , which favor collinear order unless strongly frustrated",
    ", dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions often act to produce spiral magnetic order .",
    "the resulting exchange striction , or lattice relaxation in the spin - ordered state , drives a polar charge state , i.e.  a ferroelectric .    finally , we comment once again that unfortunately we were not able to perform a direct investigation of the ferroelectric properties of fevo@xmath1 in this study .",
    "the weak quadrupole moment of @xmath0v combined with the low efg at the centers of the vo@xmath1 tetrahedra result in a coupling between @xmath0v and the crystal lattice that is too small for us to detect .",
    "ideally , future studies of fevo@xmath1 would perform @xmath78o nmr measurements on @xmath78o - enriched crystals ; because the o ions bridge the fe ions and mediate the magnetic superexchange and super - superexchange interactions , they can be expected to have a much stronger quadrupolar coupling to the lattice distortion in the ferroelectric phase .",
    "in summary , we have performed @xmath0v nmr measurements on single crystals of fevo@xmath1 with both zero and high applied magnetic fields .",
    "we confirm both magnetic transitions to phases of collinear incommensurate ( @xmath9 ) and spiral incommensurate ( @xmath20 ) magnetic order , both occurring at values lower than those found for polycrystalline samples .",
    "our data reveal a temperature @xmath45 k marking the onset of short - ranged magnetic order on the nmr time scale .",

    "these results provide explicit evidence for strongly frustrated exchange interactions in fevo@xmath1 , and thus underline the importance of magnetic frustration for the occurrence of improper ferroelectricity in multiferroic materials .",

    "<S> we report @xmath0v nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) studies on single crystals of the multiferroic material fevo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the high - temperature knight shift shows curie - weiss behavior , @xmath2 , with a large weiss constant @xmath3 116 k. however , the @xmath0v spectrum shows no ordering near these temperatures , splitting instead into two peaks below 65 k , which suggests only short - ranged magnetic order on the nmr time scale . </S>",
    "<S> two magnetic transitions are identified from peaks in the spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath4 , at temperatures @xmath5 19 k and @xmath6 13 k , which are lower than the estimates obtained from polycrystalline samples . in the low - temperature incommensurate spiral state , the maximum ordered moment </S>",
    "<S> is estimated as 1.95@xmath7/fe , or 1/3 of the local moment . </S>",
    "<S> strong low - energy spin fluctuations are also indicated by the unconventional power - law temperature dependence @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the large weiss constant , short - range magnetic correlations far above @xmath9 , small ordered moment , significant low - energy spin fluctuations , and incommensurate ordered phases all provide explicit evidence for strong magnetic frustration in fevo@xmath1 . </S>"
