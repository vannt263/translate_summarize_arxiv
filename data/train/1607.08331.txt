    "coherent population oscillations ( cpo ) is a phenomenon in which the same two levels are coupled by the pump and probe beams @xcite , which makes the population of the two levels show periodic oscillation at the beat frequency of the two fields . in recent times , it has received much interest from the quantum optics community @xcite , because it has important applications similar to the related phenomenon of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite  like slowing and stopping of light @xcite  but is more advantageous because of the following reasons .    a.   there is no third level involved , so it can be observed in a larger class of materials including gases , liquids , and room temperature solids .",
    "b.   it does not require a two - photon resonance , therefore laser jitter becomes irrelevant .",
    "we have recently reported the first observation of cpt and cpo in the two - electron atom yb @xcite , a theoretical model for which was presented in ref .",
    "we used the intercombination line ( @xmath4 transition ) at 556 nm and the even isotope @xmath5 .",
    "we used a small magnetic field ( of order 0.5 g ) to shift the cpt resonances away from line center , and retain only the cpo resonances .",
    "the linewidth of the central peak was then about 400 khz , which was a factor of two higher than the natural linewidth of the upper @xmath6 state .",
    "this was because the peak was due to multiple cpo resonances , each of which had a resonant pump field .    here",
    ", we report a study of cpo resonances in the odd isotope @xmath7yb .",
    "the main difference is that there are no cpt resonances , hence the spectrum consists of a single peak at line center corresponding to multiple cpo resonances .",
    "the role of the magnetic field is to cause the pump field to be detuned , which reduces the scattering rate from the upper state . as a result",
    ", the linewidth reduces to a subnatural value of about 100 khz .",
    "we demonstrate this using the @xmath1 hyperfine transition , but the same trend is observed for the other two hyperfine transitions in this isotope .",
    "the experimental setup shown in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] is the same as in our previous work in ref.@xcite , and is reviewed here for completeness .",
    "briefly , the @xmath8 transition at 556 nm is generated by doubling the output of a fiber laser with linewidth of 70 khz .",
    "the doubling is done in a commercial external cavity doubler using potassium niobate as the nonlinear crystal . as seen in the figure ,",
    "part of the output beam from the doubler is used to lock the laser to the correct hyperfine transition . to achieve this",
    ", the laser beam is sent perpendicular to the atomic beam , and the resulting fluorescence is collected using a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) . the frequency dither required for generating the error signal",
    "is obtained by frequency modulating the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) in the path of the laser beam .",
    "mhz using a double - passed aom .",
    "figure key : @xmath9/2halfwave retardation plate ; pbs  polarizing beam splitter ; pm fiber  polarizing maintaining fiber ; pmt  photomultiplier tube . ]    the remaining part of the laser beam is used for the experiment .",
    "it is divided into two parts  one as a pump beam and the other as a probe beam  with orthogonal linear polarizations using a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the pump beam is fixed in frequency , and is resonant with the transition used for locking the laser .",
    "this is achieved by using a second aom with an identical shift ( of @xmath10 mhz ) as the one used for laser locking .",
    "the probe beam is scanned around this transition by double passing a third aom at @xmath11 mhz .",
    "the double passing ensures directional stability as the aom is scanned , and the variable shift of @xmath12 mhz allows the probe beam to be scanned by @xmath13 mhz around the resonance .",
    "the two beams are combined on another pbs , and then transported to the experimental chamber using a polarization maintaining ( pm ) fiber .",
    "the use of the fiber ensures perfect overlap of the two beams as the probe beam is scanned .",
    "the mode coming out of the fiber is perfectly gaussian .",
    "the power in each beam is 40 w and its @xmath14 diameter is 5 mm , which gives a maximum rabi frequency of @xmath15 at beam center .",
    "the output of the fiber is sent perpendicular to the atomic beam , and the resulting fluorescence signal is detected using a second identical pmt .",
    "the atomic beam used both for laser locking and the experiment is contained in a ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber .",
    "the beam is generated by resistively heating a quartz ampule containing an ingot of unenriched yb to a temperature of about @xmath16c .",
    "the vacuum chamber is maintained at a pressure below @xmath17 torr using a 20 l / s ion pump .",
    "the required magnetic field for the experiment is generated by winding three pairs of helmholtz coils in the three orthogonal directions on the outside of the uhv chamber .",
    "the experiments with zero field are done by adjusting the currents in the three pairs of coils to get a symmetric spectrum , which tells us that all stray fields are nullified .",
    "a finite longitudinal field is generated by increasing the current in the pair of coils that are coaxial with the laser beam .",
    "the value of the field is measured using a fluxgate magnetometer .",
    "since the laser beams are linearly polarized and the fluorescence in the perpendicular direction is collected , we have to consider transitions between magnetic sublevels coupled by @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 polarizations .",
    "@xmath21 has a nuclear spin @xmath22 of @xmath23 , hence there are three hyperfine transitions in this line  @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . the magnetic sublevel structure of only the @xmath27 transition , along with sublevel transitions coupled by different polarizations ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ levels]the other two transitions are qualitatively the same .",
    "hyperfine transition in @xmath28 .",
    "transitions coupled by the pump beam are shown with solid lines , while those coupled by the probe beam are shown with dotted lines .",
    "the probe beam is scanned in frequency with a variable detuning @xmath29 .",
    "the pump beam has a fixed frequency resonant with the zero - field transition , and gets detuned in the presence of a b field . ]",
    "the main thing to note is that there are no pure @xmath30-type systems that are formed .",
    "for example , the @xmath31 ground sublevel forms 2 three - level systems  a @xmath32-type system with the ground sublevel @xmath33 and the excited sublevel @xmath34 , and a v - type system with two excited sublevels @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this implies that no dark states can be formed , which in turn implies that there are no cpt resonances .",
    "this means that the experimental spectrum will consist of a single peak corresponding to one or more cpo resonances .",
    "[ levels ] also shows that the pump beam gets red detuned by @xmath36 for the @xmath33 sublevel , where @xmath37 is the zeeman shift of the sublevel and is given by @xmath38 as seen from the figure , the @xmath39 sublevel gets detuned by the same amount but with opposite sign ( blue detuning ) .",
    "the corresponding detuning for the @xmath40 sublevels is @xmath41 .",
    "the effect of this detuning is to reduce the scattering rate from the excited state , which will result in a smaller linewidth for the cpo resonances .",
    "these expectations are borne out by the experimental spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ 3/2 - 5/2 ] .",
    "the first thing to notice is that there is a single peak , both with and without the b field .",
    "the linewidth of the peak without a field ( resonant pump beam ) is 270 khz .",
    "this is slightly larger than the natural linewidth of the intercombination line of 190 khz , as determined by the lifetime of the @xmath42 state .",
    "this is because there are multiple cpo resonances contributing to the peak . in the presence of a b field of 330 mg ,",
    "corresponding to a value of @xmath43 khz , the linewidth reduces to a subnatural value of 100 khz . as mentioned before , this is because of a reduced scattering rate from the upper state .     hyperfine transition , showing a single peak due to multiple cpo resonances .",
    "( a ) with no field .",
    "( b ) with a field of 330 mg . ]    the same behavior , i.e.  a linewidth reduction in the presence of a b field , is seen for the other two hyperfine transitions@xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "more interestingly , the linewidth of the resonance peak for the zero - field case shows a steady increase from the one for the @xmath24 transition shown in fig .",
    "[ 3/2 - 5/2](a ) .",
    "this is because the number of sublevels increases steadily , which results in more and more cpo resonances contributing to the peak .",
    "in summary , we have studied cpo resonances in the odd isotope @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic sublevel structure of the intercombination line used in this study is such that there are no cpt resonances , as in the case of the even isotope used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field is to cause the pump beam to be detuned from resonance , which results in a reduced scattering rate from the excited state of the transition .",
    "the effect of this on the resonance peak is to reduce its linewidth .",
    "the linewidth reduces to a subnatural value of 100 khz with a magnetic field of 330 mg .",
