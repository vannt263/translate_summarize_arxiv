    "theoretical and computational treatment of the effects of electron correlations remains a significant challenge . despite decades of effort invested into solving the schroedinger equation ( by independent - particle , mean - field and perturbative methods )",
    ", there are still major difficulties in predicting and explaining many phenomena related to bonding , cohesion , optical properties , magnetic orderings , superconductivity and other quantum effects . the pressure - induced structural phase transition in silicon from diamond to @xmath0-tin @xcite",
    "is an excellent test for theoretical total energy methods .",
    "the transition pressure provides a sensitive measure of small relative energy changes between the two phases ( one a semiconductor and the other a semimetal ) .",
    "experimentally , the transition pressure is well characterized .",
    "density - functional theory ( dft ) results have been unsatisfactory , exhibiting sensitivity to the particular form of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional .",
    "even the generally much more accurate diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method @xcite has shown @xcite a noticeable fixed - node @xcite error .    the phaseless auxiliary - field ( af ) quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) afqmc method @xcite provides a new alternative for _ ab initio _ many - body calculations to address electron correlation effects .",
    "all stochastic qmc methods @xcite use projection from a reference many - body wave function . in principle",
    "these methods are exact . in practice",
    ", however , the fermionic sign problem @xcite causes exponential growth of the variance with system size and projection time .",
    "transient methods , @xcite which maintain exactness while enduring the sign problem , can be very useful _ if _",
    "sufficiently accurate information can be obtained with a relatively short projection , as we illustrate in the present paper ( sec .",
    "[ sec : benching - phaseless ] ) . in general , however , the sign problem must be completely eliminated ( usually with an approximation ) to achieve a general , efficient method for realistic systems .",
    "the majority of qmc calculations in fermion systems have been done in this form , for example with the fixed - node approximation @xcite in dmc , which has been the most commonly applied qmc method in electronic structure .    the phaseless afqmc controls the sign problem with a global phase condition in the over - complete manifold of slater determinants ( in which antisymmetry is imposed ) .",
    "since the antisymmetry ensures that each walker is automatically `` fermionic '' , the tendency for the walker population to collapse to a global bosonic state is eliminated in this approach .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that an overall phase constraint applied in this manifold to be less restrictive@xcite .",
    "applications indicate that this often is the case . in a variety of systems",
    "afqmc has demonstrated accuracy equaling or surpassing the most accurate ( non - exponential scaling ) many - body computational methods .",
    "these include first- and second - row molecules , @xcite transition metal oxide molecules , @xcite simple solids , @xcite post-@xmath2 elements @xcite van der waals systems , @xcite molecular excited states , @xcite and in molecules in which bonds are being stretched or broken .",
    "@xcite most of these calculations used a mean - field single determinant taken directly from dft or hartree - fock ( hf ) for the trial wave function in the phaseless constraint . as a result , the phaseless afqmc method reduces the reliance of qmc on the quality of the trial wave function .",
    "@xcite this is desirable in order to make qmc more of a general and `` blackbox '' approach .",
    "the use of a basis set is a second feature that distinguishes the afqmc method from the standard dmc method .",
    "@xcite the latter works in electron coordinate space . as a result , there is no finite basis set error _ per se _ in dmc .",
    "there are presently two main flavors of the phaseless afqmc method , corresponding to two different choices of the one - electron basis : ( i ) planewave with norm - conserving pseudopotential ( as widely adopted in solid state physics ) , @xcite and ( ii ) gaussian type basis sets ( the standard in quantum chemistry ) .",
    "@xcite in planewave afqmc , convergence to the basis set limit is easily controlled , as in dft calculations , using the plane wave cutoff energy @xmath3 .    in this paper , planewave afqmc",
    "is used to calculate the relative energy differences between the two phases .",
    "the goal is to examine the accuracy of phaseless afqmc , benchmarking the energy difference at the transition volumes against experiment and dmc results , and against exact free - projection afqmc using smaller primitive cells . in the phaseless afqmc approach ,",
    "all but the error from the phaseless constraint can be controlled systematically and driven essentially to zero .",
    "comparison with exact afqmc free - projection shows that the systematic error in the total energies due to the phaseless constraint is well within 0.5m@xmath1/atom .",
    "consistent with these internal benchmarks , the transition pressure calculated from the phaseless afqmc in large supercells is found to be in very good agreement with experiment .",
