    "ferroelectrics are insulating solids of technological importance because of their ability to maintain an electric polarization that can be reoriented by the application of an electric field.@xcite this property lends itself to technological applications including microelectronic devices and computer memories . among ferroelectrics ,",
    "perovskites constitute a subclass that has been of theoretical and experimental interest since the discovery in 1945 of its first member , barium titanate ( batio@xmath0 ) .",
    "this interest is motivated in part by the relative simplicity of their cubic crystalline phase . for a perovskite of general formula abo@xmath0 ,",
    "this structure contains cations a at the cube corners , a cation b at the center of the cube , and oxygen atoms at the center of the cube faces forming a regular octahedron , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_struct](a ) .",
    "typically , perovskites are found in this cubic paraelectric phase at high temperature ; as the temperature is reduced , symmetry - lowering distortions to other phases , including ferroelectric ones , may occur .",
    "the electronics industry s demands for smaller components have made thin ferroelectric films the subject of recent attention.@xcite experimentally , it is found that the properties of ferroelectrics in thin - film form generally differ significantly from those in the bulk .",
    "while many factors are expected to contribute to these differences , it has been shown that the properties of perovskite thin films are strongly influenced by the magnitude of the epitaxial strain resulting from lattice - matching the film to the substrate , known as misfit strain or epitaxial strain .",
    "previous theoretical studies have isolated the effects of epitaxial strain on the structure and properties of films by imposing the epitaxial constraint on the in - plane lattice vectors of a periodic bulk sample . using a phenomenological landau - devonshire model , pertsev , zembilgotov and tagantsev@xcite",
    "introduced the concept of mapping the equilibrium structure of a ferroelectric perovskite material versus temperature and misfit strain , thus producing a phase diagram of the observable epitaxial phases .",
    "given the importance of strain in determining the properties of these films , these diagrams have proven to be of enormous interest to experimentalists seeking to interpret the results of experiments on epitaxial thin films and heterostructures .",
    "this phenomenological approach should give excellent results in the temperature / strain regime in which the model parameters were fitted ( usually near the bulk ferroelectric transition ) but will generally be less accurate when extrapolated to other regimes .",
    "in particular , figure 1 of ref .",
    "shows that two different sets of parameters can give two quite different phase diagrams .",
    "furthermore , it is only possible to study materials for which all the needed experimental information is available .    in previous work,@xcite",
    "we have examined the effects of epitaxial strain with an analogous , but fully first - principles , approach . specifically , we presented density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite calculations for the structure and properties of batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 with varying in - plane strain , fully relaxing all structural degrees of freedom consistent with uniform distortions ( that is , retaining the five - atom unit cell ) . from this",
    ", we obtained zero - temperature phase diagrams that complement the phenomenological results of pertsev and coworkers . in this paper , we show that these phase diagrams can be reproduced using the first - principles energy parameterization of king - smith and vanderbilt , and give results for an additional five perovskite oxides : catio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 , nanbo@xmath0 , pbzro@xmath0 , and bazro@xmath0 .",
    "this approach greatly decreases the computational effort involved in computing the phase diagram and readily allows the inclusion of nonzero external stress.@xcite moreover , the parameters can be fully specified in a compact table , and the functional form of the energy is suitable for analytical computations and conceptual interpretation , leading to a classification of possible stress - strain phase diagrams .",
    "these results can be used for predictions of the structure of epitaxially strained thin films grown on substrates with square symmetry , and for the design of novel perovskite strained - layer superlattices with two or more components .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_method ] we describe the extension of the ksv method to study the effects of the epitaxial strain constraint and external stress , and the first - principles calculations used to obtain the ksv parameters . section  [ sec_results ] presents the results for the eight perovskite oxides considered , including the sequence of phase transitions with varying misfit strain at zero stress , and phase diagrams in which we show the most stable phase for given misfit strain and external stress . in sec .",
    "[ sec_discussion ] , we review the approximations and discuss how to use the present results for the prediction of the structures and polarization of thin films and superlattices . finally , in sec .  [ sec_summary ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the starting point of this analysis is the parameterized total - energy expression presented by king - smith and vanderbilt in ref .  .",
    "this is a taylor expansion around the cubic perovskite structure in terms of the six independent components @xmath1 of the strain tensor ( @xmath2 is a voigt index , @xmath31 - 6 ) and the three cartesian components @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) describing the amplitude of the soft mode defined by the pattern of eigen - displacements associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the ( zone - center ) force - constant matrix .",
    "the arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig_struct ] indicate a typical displacement pattern associated with this mode , greatly magnified to allow its visualization .",
    "the contributions to the energy ( per unit cell ) can divided into terms arising from pure strain and from pure soft - mode amplitude , and an interaction term , @xmath6 with the zero of the energy corresponding to the cubic structure . for crystals with cubic symmetry",
    "the strain energy is given , correct to second order in the strains , by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are related to the elastic constants of the crystal by factors of the cell volume .",

    "( [ eq_gtilde ] ) , we can predict the phase diagram as a function of misfit strain @xmath21 and the normal external stress @xmath40 by minimizing @xmath42 to find the values of the ground - state soft - mode amplitude components . for a fourth order theory , like the present ksv expression",
    ", the entire optimization process can be done analytically , since it is possible to compute first and second derivatives of @xmath38 and to do a stability analysis of the various possible phases , classified by the nature of the minimum - energy soft - mode vector .",

    "the agreement between the two sets of results is very good , with the small differences present arising from two sources .",
    "first , the first - principles calculations in ref . were performed using the projector - augmented wave method,@xcite while the first - principles calculations used to obtain the ksv coefficients in the present work were performed using ultrasoft pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite second , there are the intrinsic errors due to the use of a taylor expansion described in the previous section , which are expected to grow as the strain and soft mode magnitudes increase .",
    "figure [ fig_btdisp ] shows the displacements of the atoms from their centrosymmetric perovskite positions as strain varies .",
    "again , the agreement of the ksv results ( right panel ) with the full dft results ( left panel ) is very good . in particular ,",
    "the square root behavior predicted by the ksv theory is exhibited by the more exact dft calculations .",
    "as the in - plane strain increases , we observe a second - order phase transition ( _ c_@xmath52_r _ ) , and while the magnitude of the atomic displacements continues to diminish along [ 001 ] , the displacements in the _ xy _ plane begin to grow . with increasing tensile strain ,",
    "the displacements along [ 001 ] vanish at the _ r_@xmath52_aa _ transition , while the displacements in the _ xy _ plane continue to grow smoothly . in this way",
    ", we see that the polarization vector continuously rotates in going from the @xmath48 phase through the @xmath53 phase to the @xmath50 phase .",
    "a quantitative limitation of using a single misfit - strain - independent local mode in the ksv model is shown here in the form of an artificial constraint equating the @xmath54 and @xmath55 displacements .",
    "this constraint is removed when full dft calculations are performed and the atoms are free to relax within the given space group , but the magnitude of these displacements is not very different from that obtained in the ksv theory .",
    "figure  [ fig_pol ] shows the values of @xmath56 for the various compounds as a function of misfit strain .",
    "the square - root singularity at @xmath56=0 corresponds to an _",
    "r_@xmath52_aa _ or _",
    "c_@xmath52_p _ transition .",
    "the slope discontinuity visible at finite @xmath56 in some curves corresponds to the _ c_@xmath52_r _ transition of fig .",
    "[ fig_parab](a ) , while the termination of the curves at finite @xmath56 for catio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 corresponds to the encounter with the tie line in fig .",
    "[ fig_parab](b ) .",
    "the general trend , of course , is a strong increase of @xmath56 with compressive strain , with considerable enhancement possible over the zero misfit strain value .",
    "interestingly , according to this plot catio@xmath0 would have a large @xmath56 if the zone boundary distortions that are present in its actual ground - state crystal structure were suppressed .",
    "this result is supported by recent full dft calculations.@xcite      we now consider application of a nonzero normal stress @xmath40 .",
    "the stress - strain phase diagrams obtained for each of the eight perovskites are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_diags ] .",
    "all eight diagrams show a universal topology with straight - line phase boundaries meeting at a single crossing point .",
    "the perfect linearity of the boundaries is an artifact of the truncation of our energy expansion to fourth order , but the presence of a single crossing point is robust against the introduction of small higher - order terms . the crossing point strain @xmath57 and stress @xmath58 can be connected with the critical strain and stress in the isotropic cubic perovskite at which a structural instability first occurs as the pressure is reduced or made more negative .",
    "there are two main variants of the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_diags ] , the first with four phases ( _ c , r , p , and _ aa / a _ _ ) , and the second with three phases ( _ c , p , aa / a and a mixed phase region _ ) . the varied behavior of the zero - stress diagrams of fig .  [ fig_parab ]",
    "can now be interpreted , in the context of fig .",
    "[ fig_diags ] , as reflecting whether the zero - stress axis lies above , or below , @xmath58 .",
    "more specifically , the coordinates of the crossing point can be expressed as functions of the total - energy coefficients as follows : @xmath59 the strain and stress values at the crossing point are rather modest , with the single exception of pbzro@xmath0 .",
    "pbzro@xmath0 has the lowest soft - mode eigenvalue , and therefore the most negative value of @xmath13 ( table [ tab_coefficients ] ) .",
    "its @xmath60-polarized soft - mode eigenvalue also changes more slowly on application of an @xmath22 strain , resulting in a less negative value of @xmath17 .",
    "these values of @xmath13 and @xmath17 result in @xmath57 and @xmath61 being about an order of magnitude more negative for pbzro@xmath0 than for the other seven compounds .    for external stresses below @xmath61 ,",
    "the behavior is similar in all eight compounds , showing a @xmath48-@xmath44-@xmath50 ( @xmath48-@xmath44-@xmath49 for bazro@xmath0 ) sequence of second - order phase transitions , with the elastic enthalpies of the phases behaving as in fig .",
    "[ fig_parab](b ) . in this fourth - order ksv theory , the phase boundaries are straight lines given by @xmath62 rewriting these expressions as functions of the fundamental coefficients of table [ tab_coefficients ] , we see that the value of @xmath18 plays a central role . for materials like the ones we are studying , for which @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , the slope of the @xmath66 transition line is found to be positive if @xmath67 for all eight perovskites this slope is indeed positive , since the left hand side of the inequality is positive , and @xmath18 is positive or only slightly negative but much smaller in magnitude than @xmath17 ( the latter being the case for batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 ) .",
    "the slope of the @xmath68 transition is positive if @xmath69 where the inequality is not satisfied for batio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 , which have negative values for @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , for these two perovskites a transition from the @xmath50 to the paraelectric @xmath44 phase is induced by applying a sufficiently high external tensile stress at fixed misfit strain , while for the others the transition would be from the @xmath44 to the @xmath50 ( or @xmath49 , in the case of bazro@xmath0 ) phase .    for external stresses above @xmath61 ,",
    "two kinds of behaviors are found .",
    "five of the perovskites ( batio@xmath0 , srtio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 , nanbo@xmath0 , and pbzro@xmath0 ) show a @xmath48-@xmath53-@xmath50 sequence of second - order phase transitions under these conditions , with the energies of the phases behaving as in fig .",
    "[ fig_parab](a ) . in this case , the phase boundaries are straight lines of the form @xmath70 for all five compounds , the slopes of both boundaries are positive .",
    "the other behavior observed for external stress above @xmath61 is one in which @xmath48 and @xmath50 ( or @xmath49 , in the case of bazro@xmath0 ) domains are expected .",
    "the energy curves behave either as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig_parab](c ) ( for catio@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 ) or as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_parab](d ) ( for bazro@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , in the intermediate region , instead of a uniform phase , the system is expected to break into domains , as explained in the previous section for pbtio@xmath0 and catio@xmath0 at zero external stress .",
    "in this section , we first consider in detail the several approximations that are responsible for the ease and simplicity with which we can generate stress - strain phase diagrams for perovskites .",
    "we then discuss and give examples of the applicability of the theory to realistic experimental studies of perovskite films and superlattices .    within the ksv theory the thermodynamical potential",
    "is expanded as a taylor series in strain and soft - mode amplitude , where the reference used is the perfect cubic perovskite of fig .",
    "[ fig_struct](a ) .",
    "the truncation at low order in the variables of the expansion means that the expansion decreases in accuracy for large distortions . as relevant misfit strains are generally rather small ( less than 2% )",
    ", this appears not to have significant implications .",
    "in addition , in the present form of the theory , the modes selected for the expansion allow only phases that involve five - atom unit cells to be considered .",
    "in particular , we do not take into account the possibility of cell - doubling oxygen octahedra rotations , which have been shown to be important in srtio@xmath0,@xcite catio@xmath0,@xcite and pbzro@xmath0.@xcite in principle , such rotations could condense in the other compounds under high enough misfit strains , but for batio@xmath0 it has been shown@xcite that this does not occur until one reaches experimentally irrelevant strains , and we expect that this will also be the case for most of these other compounds .",
    "second , our calculations are done at zero temperature . extending them to finite temperatures could in principle",
    "be done using an effective hamiltonian method as we did in ref .   for batio@xmath0 . however",
    ", this would involve designing for each perovskite an effective hamiltonian along the lines described by zhong , vanderbilt , and rabe,@xcite and is left for future work .",
    "third , our model does not include the small effect of the zero - point motion of the ions ( see ref .   for a discussion ) .",
    "finally , our theory relies on the lda to compute the exchange and correlation terms in dft .",
    "this introduces small systematic errors in the calculation , the most important of which is probably the error in the equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "however , such errors are well understood and well characterized in perovskites , and tend to be similar for different materials of this class , so that there is a tendency for cancellation of errors in relative quantities such as misfit strains ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the phenomenological landau - devonshire approach @xcite also requires approximations , which we review here for the purposes of comparison .",
    "its starting thermodynamical potential is the bulk free energy expanded in polarization and stress , with linear temperature dependence in selected coefficients .",
    "sixth order terms are needed as their importance increases at finite temperature.@xcite the reference used is the paraelectric cubic perovskite phase at the bulk critical temperature @xmath71 , and the parameters are fit to reproduce experimental observations of the behavior near the bulk ferroelectric transition . for the epitaxial strain dependence",
    ", a legendre transformation is then made to obtain the potential as a function of polarization and misfit strain . with parameters extrapolated to zero temperature ,",
    "this can be compared to the potential in the present work using the linear relation between the polarization and the soft mode amplitude ( [ eqn_polarization ] ) .",
    "due to the way in which the parameters are fit , the landau - devonshire potential will give its most accurate results for small misfit strains and temperatures near the bulk @xmath71 , while the first - principles potential will be more reliable for the zero - temperature misfit - strain phase diagram .",
    "we now turn to the applicability of our theory to the prediction and understanding of properties of experimentally relevant systems .",
    "we first discuss the case of thin films , and then consider the case of strained - layer superlattices .",
    "the theory presented here can be used directly to predict the structure and polarization of a single - domain perovskite - oxide thin film grown on a substrate with square - lattice symmetry .",
    "the effects of epitaxial strain will be most evident in films coherent with the substrate . in equilibrium ,",
    "coherent epitaxial growth is possible up to a certain critical thickness , which depends upon the misfit between film and substrate materials as well as upon temperature and other growth conditions . using low - temperature synthesis",
    ", coherence can be maintained far beyond the equilibrium critical thickness , as has been shown for batio@xmath0 grown on gdsco@xmath0 ( @xmath72% misfit strain).@xcite under such coherent conditions , the full misfit should be used as the input for our theory .",
    "for example , in the case of batio@xmath0 on gdsco@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ fig_diags ] shows a predicted enhancement of @xmath56 from 0.21 to 0.31 c / m@xmath73 as a result of a 1.0% reduction of the in - plane lattice constant from the theoretical ground - state value of 7.448 bohr to 7.374 bohr . for thicker , partially - relaxed films ,",
    "the strain should be taken to correspond to the in - plane lattice constant measured for the film @xcite ; this assumes that all the misfit dislocations responsible for the relaxation are located at the interface .",
    "these predictions are based on the assumption that the epitaxial strain strongly dominates other factors in determining the state of the film .",
    "similarly , for strained - layer superlattices , the structure and polarization of a perovskite - oxide layer in a superlattice will in general be significantly different from the corresponding bulk .",
    "the states of the component layers will largely be determined by the in - plane strain imposed by lattice matching to the other components and/or to the substrate , and can be obtained by referring to the theoretical phase diagrams at the relevant value of misfit strain . in addition , the normal component of the polarization in each layer , at the common in - plane strain , is an important consideration in determining the structure and polarization of the overall superlattice .",
    "if the normal polarization is discontinuous , electrostatic energy considerations will tend to polarize the low - polarization layer and depolarize the high - polarization layer to make the normal polarization uniform through the sublattice,@xcite with accompanying changes in the normal strain of the layer . as an example , this analysis has proved useful in the interpretation of first - principles results and experiments on the structure of partially - relaxed srtio@xmath0/batio@xmath0 superlattices .",
    "@xcite    first - principles information about the effects of epitaxial strain on the structure and polarization of component layers also allows us to determine the relative stability of a given superlattice .",
    "it is well known that lattice matching of the components minimizes the elastic energy and thus increases the stability . in the case where one or more components have a nonzero normal polarization , the electrostatic energy of the superlattice can be minimized by  polarization matching , \" where the components are selected to have the same normal polarization at the common in - plane strain .",
    "for example , according to our calculations , batio@xmath0 and nanbo@xmath0 have the same normal polarization of 0.34 c / m@xmath73 at a common in - plane theoretical lattice constant of 7.336 bohr , corresponding to small compressive misfit strains of less that 0.2% , and thus this is a favorable combination with respect both to elastic and electrostatic energy .",
    "in general , however , it is not possible to minimize both elastic and electrostatic energy in this way , and a trade - off between the two is necessary to form the superlattice .",
    "it should be kept in mind , however , that for both films and superlattices , the assumptions that the system is in a single domain and that the epitaxial strain strongly dominates other factors will not be valid in all cases .",
    "phase diagrams including multiple - domain states have , for example , been discussed in refs . .",
    "other influences that may be important include surface relaxation and reconstruction , atomic and electronic rearrangements at the interface , imperfectly compensated macroscopic electric fields , deviations from stoichiometry , and the presence of defects .",
    "we have applied the first - principles total - energy parameterization of king - smith and vanderbilt@xcite to study the effects of epitaxial strain and external stress on the structure and properties of perovskites .",
    "we report phase diagrams and polarizations for the same set of eight compounds as in ref .",
    ": batio@xmath0 , srtio@xmath0 , catio@xmath0 , knbo@xmath0 , nanbo@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0 , pbzro@xmath0 , and bazro@xmath0 .",
    "an updated set of parameters , computed with a comparable first - principles method at higher precision , are provided in table [ tab_coefficients ] .",
    "the simple form of the parameterization is seen to be useful in reducing the computational effort for generating these phase diagrams relative to full first - principles calculations , and many features of the phase diagrams can be extracted and interpreted analytically .",
    "we have discussed the use of these results in predicting the structure and polarization of epitaxial perovskite films and strained layer superlattices .",
    "additional properties of interest , such as dielectric or piezoelectric constants can also be computed within this framework .",
    "the last column in table v of ref .   contains values that are not consistent with equation ( 19b ) of the paper .",
    "the correct values are : @xmath740.147 ( batio@xmath0 ) , @xmath740.051 ( srtio@xmath0 ) , 0.017 ( catio@xmath0 ) , @xmath740.113 ( knbo@xmath0 ) , @xmath740.041 ( nanbo@xmath0 ) , 0.014 ( pbtio@xmath0 ) , @xmath740.008 ( pbzro@xmath0 ) , and 0.014 ( bazro@xmath0 ) .",
    "since the sign of @xmath75 for each perovskite has not changed , the conclusions concerning phase transitions given in their paper still hold ."
