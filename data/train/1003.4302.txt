    "ofdm - based relaying combines the advantages of both ofdm and relaying techniques to improve network performance and efficiency .",
    "it is essential that the relaying techniques can be maximally explored in the ofdm system . in a narrow - band single carrier system ,",
    "the relay retransmits the processed version of the received signal over the same carrier . for an ofdm system with multiple subcarriers",
    ", the relay has an additional frequency dimension available , which can be exploited to process the incoming signals adaptively based on subcarrier strength for relaying purpose , and thus can potentially improve the overall relay performance . without such consideration , directly applying a relaying method optimized for single - carrier systems will not be optimal in an ofdm system . in this paper , we address how to optimally perform channel aware linear processing of the incoming signals over multiple subcarriers at the relay to maximize the relaying performance in an ofdm system .    subcarrier pairing , which maps incoming and outgoing subcarriers at the relay , can be viewed as a special case of unitary linear processing .",
    "it was first proposed independently in @xcite and @xcite for a single amplified - and - forward ( af ) ofdm relay system . for relaying without the direct source - destination path available , @xcite used integer programming to find the optimal pairing that maximizes the sum snr , whereas from a system - design perspective , @xcite proposed a subcarrier pairing scheme optimal in the noise - free case , assuming uniform power allocation .",
    "these works sparked interests for researchers in this area .",
    "subsequently , a joint subcarrier pairing and power allocation scheme was studied in @xcite , although the power constraint at the relay can not be guaranteed in the presented scheme .",
    "furthermore , the sorted subcarrier pairing was studied in mimo ofdm systems @xcite , as well as in decode - and - forward ( df ) relay systems @xcite .",
    "all of the above works focus on the relay path only , without direct - path transmission , perhaps partially due to the difficulty of finding subcarrier pairing in such a case . for relaying with direct path available for full diversity ,",
    "two suboptimal subcarrier pairing schemes were studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a framework to address the optimal unitary linear processing for relaying in an ofdm system .",
    "a half - duplex two - hop af relay network is considered , where a unitary matrix is applied to the incoming signals across subcarriers at the relay , and the relay then forwards the amplified version of the processed signals .",
    "we propose a general framework that enables us to analyze the effect of unitary linear processing matrix on the achievable rate of such relaying system . constrained on the class of permutation matrices",
    ", this framework enables us to find the optimal permutation matrix , subcarrier pairing , for relaying in both scenarios , without and with the direct path .",
    "the former is consistent with previous works , and the latter has never been shown before to the best of our knowledge .",
    "furthermore , we prove that the optimal unitary linear processing matrix is in fact a permutation matrix which gives an optimal subcarrier pairing strategy .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ systemmodel ] ,",
    "we present the system model and formulate the optimal linear processing matrix to maximize the achievable rate .",
    "section [ perm ] presents our analytical framework to determine the optimal permutation matrix and hence the optimal subcarrier pairing strategy . in section [ sec : opt ] , we show that subcarrier pairing in fact is the optimal linear processing strategy .",
    "we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance gain achieved through optimal subcarrier pairing in section [ simulation ] and finally conclude in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a dual - hop relay network with a pair of source and destination nodes and a single af relay node in an ofdm system with @xmath0 subcarriers . we constrain ourselves to half - duplex transmission , where a relay node is either in transmission or reception but not simultaneously .",
    "the cooperative transmission takes place in two phases . in the first phase the source sends data through @xmath0 subcarriers to the relay and destination simultaneously ( if the direct path is available ) .",
    "the relay then performs linear processing of the received signals over @xmath0 subcarriers , and forwards the amplified version of the processed signals to the destination .",
    "we denote the channel gain over subcarrier @xmath1 from source to relay , from relay to destination , and from source to destination by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , respectively , and @xmath5 the source signal transmitted on subcarrier @xmath1 with power coefficient @xmath6 .",
    "the received signals at the relay and destination in the first phase are given by _",
    "r & = & _ 1_s+ _ r , + _",
    "d^(1 ) & = & _ 0_s + _",
    "d^(1 ) , [ basic formula ] where @xmath7^t$ ] and @xmath8^t$ ] are the received signal vector at relay and destination , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the corresponding channel matrices , and @xmath11 with @xmath12^t$ ] being the power coefficient vector .",
    "the signals are i.i.d . with average unit power @xmath13=\\ibf$ ] .",
    "moreover , @xmath14^t$ ] and @xmath15^t$ ] are awgn at the relay and the destination , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .    in the second phase , the received signal @xmath18 is linearly processed at the relay with a unitary matrix @xmath19 , and the relay retransmits the amplified version of the processed signals .",
    "the received signal vector at the destination is given by _",
    "d^(2 ) & = & _ 2 _ r _ r + _ d^(2 ) + & = & _ 2 _ r ( _ 1_s+ _ r ) + _ d^(2 ) [ relaylink ] where @xmath20^t$ ] , @xmath21 , and @xmath22^t \\sim\\mathcal{cn}(\\mu,\\sigma_d^2\\ibf)$ ] .",
    "the power coefficient vector for the processed signal at the relay is denoted as @xmath23 , and we have @xmath24 . note that , @xmath19 is a unitary matrix with @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the maximum average total power at the source and the relay , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath28 must satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , the linear processing matrix @xmath19 and the power coefficient matrix @xmath30 at the relay must satisfy @xmath31 to focus on the effect of the processing matrix @xmath19 on the relay performance , in this study , we assume a pre - determined power allocation over subcarriers at the source , @xmath32 is given . at the relay , we assume that the relay _ equally _ amplifies the processed signal over the subcarriers , @xmath30 is a scalar of identity matrix @xmath33 with d_r = [ pwconstraint2 ] which is obtained based on ( [ pwconstraint ] ) .",
    "note that since @xmath19 is a unitary matrix , it does not appeared in ( [ pwconstraint2 ] ) .    in a relay system , the direct path between the source and destination may or maynot be available .",
    "when the direct path is available , we assume the receiver uses the maximum ratio combining to improve the reception and maximize the received snr .",
    "we consider the achievable rate in such af relay ofdm system .",
    "regardless whether the direct path is available , we can rewrite the end - to - end system equation in the following general form  = _",
    "eq()+ _ eq [ gen_sys_eqn ] where @xmath34 is the equivalent channel matrix and is a function of the processing matrix @xmath19 , and @xmath35 the equivalent noise term",
    ". then the system achievable rate is given by [ rate ] c ( ) = ( + _ n^-1_eq()_eq^h ( ) ) where @xmath36 $ ] is the covariance matrix of the equivalent noise term .",
    "the factor @xmath37 reflects the half - duplex operation .    for the conventional ofdm relaying without linear processing , @xmath38",
    ", the relay simply forwards the amplified signal to the destination over the same subcarrier . however , such forwarding is in general not optimal in terms of maximizing the achievable rate .",
    "a special class of @xmath19 is the permutation matrix @xmath39 , for which linear processing reduces to subcarrier pairing .",
    "such a scheme would uniquely couple a subcarrier over the first hop with a possibly different subcarrier over the second hop for signal relaying .",
    "this technique was studied recently in a few specific relay models @xcite and was shown to improve the rate .",
    "however , the optimality of such an approach remained unknown .",
    "our goal in this study is to find the optimal linear processing matrix @xmath40 to maximize the achievable rate [ objective ] ^ * = _ : ^h=(+ _ n^-1_eq()_eq^h ( ) ) . in the following ,",
    "we will first focus on the class of permutation matrices for relaying with and without direct path .",
    "we will then discuss the optimal @xmath40 for these scenarios .",
    "to solve ( [ objective ] ) , we first focus on the class of permutation matrices @xmath41 , and propose a general framework to find the optimal subcarrier pairing .",
    "this framework relies on the following result    [ lemma ] let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be two diagonal matrices . for @xmath44 among all possible permutation matrices",
    "@xmath39 , the optimal @xmath45 is the one that maps the sorted absolute values of the diagonal entries of @xmath42 to the sorted absolute value of the diagonal entries of @xmath43 .    to show the above",
    ", we see that the objective function in ( [ general form ] ) can essentially be rewritten as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the diagonal elements of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath50 be the corresponding ordered sequences .",
    "then it is not difficult to show that @xmath51 .      in this case , the destination is out of the transmission zone of the source . from ( [ relaylink ] ) , the equivalent channel matrix , noise vector , and its covariance matrix in ( [ gen_sys_eqn ] ) in this case",
    "are given by _",
    "eq ( ) & = & _ 2_r_1_s , + _ eq & = & _ 2_r_r + _",
    "d^(2 ) , + _",
    "n & = & _ r^2_2_r^2_2^h + _ d^2 .",
    "[ rn ] note that , except @xmath39 , all matrices in ( [ rn ] ) are diagonal . using the property of the determinant , @xmath52 , from ( [ rate ] ) ,",
    "we can write the end - to - end achievable rate as @xmath53 inserting the expression of @xmath54 , ( [ cap1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath55 the @xmath56-th diagonal entries @xmath47 and @xmath48 of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "following lemma [ lemma ] , the optimal @xmath39 is to pair the ordered sequences of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , or equivalently , to pairing the following two ordered sequences @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the received snr from source to relay , and from relay to destination , over the @xmath56th subcarrier , respectively .",
    "note that , because @xmath64 is monotonically increasing for @xmath65 , ordering @xmath59 is equivalent to ordering @xmath66 . under the noise - free relay assumption ,",
    "@xmath67 , the author of @xcite proved that the sorted subcarrier pairing , which couples the relay subcarriers @xmath68 with the transmit subcarriers @xmath69 , is the optimal pairing scheme .",
    "our result shows that this pairing scheme is optimal for noisy relaying as well .",
    "we now consider the case when the direct path is available , relaying with full diversity . through the maximum ratio combining technique , the observations from the direct path and the relay node can be coherently added .",
    "define @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , where @xmath54 is given in ( [ rn ] ) .",
    "the achievable rate in this case is given by @xmath73 to find the optimum @xmath39 to maximize @xmath74 , we again apply the result in lemma [ lemma ] , and all we need is to find the equivalent @xmath42 and @xmath43 to express ( [ cap_2 ] ) as the form in ( [ general form ] ) . to do so , we re - arrange ( [ cap_2 ] ) as @xmath75 where the second term of ( [ factor1 ] ) follows from the property @xmath52 .",
    "since the first term of ( [ factor1 ] ) is independent of @xmath39 , we are only interested in the second term as a function of @xmath39 , which can be written as @xmath76 again using @xmath77 , we can set @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and ( [ factor2 ] ) can then be transformed into the form of ( [ general form ] ) .",
    "based on this , we obtain the optimal subcarrier pairing scheme for relaying with full diversity . examining the diagonal entries of @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,",
    "we conclude that the optimal pairing is essentially to order the following quantities over the input and output subcarriers of the relay , respectively , \\ { } , \\ { } where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath80 , are the received snr from source to relay , from relay to destination , and from source to destination , over the @xmath56th subcarrier , respectively . again , sorting @xmath81 is equivalent to sorting @xmath82 .",
    "thus , the optimal pairing for relaying with full diversity has a very clear strategy based on the snr on each path : it is to match incoming and outgoing subcarriers of the relay , according to the snr strength on the relay - destination subcarrier , and the relative ratio of snr strengths on the source - relay and source - destination paths .",
    "various sorting algorithms can be employed at the relay node with the computational complexity of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "in previous section , we have considered the special class of permutation for linear processing , and have obtained the optimal permutation @xmath45 in different relay scenarios using the proposed framework . back to the general problem in ( [ objective ] )",
    ", the following result shows that the optimal permutation @xmath45 is in fact the optimal linear processing matrix @xmath40 .    [ theorem ]",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be two diagonal matrices .",
    "the solution to the following maximization @xmath84\\ ] ] is @xmath85 , where @xmath45 is the solution in lemma [ lemma ] .",
    "see appendix [ appendix1 ]",
    ".    combining theorem [ theorem ] and the results in section [ perm ] , the following result immediately follows :    the optimal @xmath40 for ( [ objective ] ) in the relaying problem with or without direct path considered in section [ perm ] is @xmath85 .    in other words ,",
    "the optimal linear processing is essentially subcarrier pairing with the optimal pairing strategy demonstrated in section [ perm ] .",
    "in this section , we compare the performance of the optimal subcarrier pairing ( sp ) scheme with other non optimal schemes through monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we consider the scenario of relaying with direct path .",
    "we assume a 5mhz ofdm system with @xmath86 .",
    "the achievable rate is averaged over randomly generated multi - tap frequency selective channels ( with fixed channel order @xmath87 ) .",
    "a source - destination pair is placed at a distance @xmath88 apart , and the distances between source and relay , and relay and destination are set at @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the pathloss exponent of 2 is assumed .",
    "we assume @xmath91 , and @xmath26 is equally allocated across subcarriers , @xmath92 .",
    "we denote @xmath93 as the average per subcarrier received snr over the direct path .",
    "we first consider @xmath94 m , @xmath95 m , and @xmath96 m .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] depicts the performance of the average rate per subcarrier vs. snr , averaged over random channel realizations under the following four schemes : optimal sp scheme @xmath45 ; no sp used ; a random @xmath19 used ; using @xmath45 that is obtained assuming no direct path ( ( [ c_nd ] ) ) .",
    "the reason we consider the fourth scheme is that , in some cases , it may be easier for the relay to compute the optimal sp only based on the snrs obtained on the two relay paths , although the receiver may use direct path signals for processing .",
    "we see that the optimal sp scheme outperforms all other schemes .",
    "when compared with the non sp scheme , it provides about @xmath97db gain .",
    "we expect to see a substantial gap between the optimal sp and other schemes in the highly asymmetric and frequency - selective channels .         ]",
    "next , we study when subcarrier pairing is the most beneficial . in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the effect of the relative snr strengths , between relay and direct paths , on the achievable rate under different linear processing schemes . with fixed @xmath94",
    "m , we vary the relay position between source and destination .",
    "we plot the average rate vs. the relative distance @xmath98 for @xmath99db .",
    "this figure shows that the performance of all schemes coincide , when relay is very close to destination , @xmath100 is very high . in this case",
    ", sp does not provide much performance gain . on the other hand , when the relay moves closer to source ,",
    "the gain of using the optimal sp over other schemes become more substantial .",
    "in this paper , af relaying with unitary linear processing at the relay in an ofdm system is considered .",
    "we proposed a general framework to analyze how to select the unitary processing matrix to maximize the system achievable rate .",
    "we first considered the class of permutation matrices , and based on the proposed framework , we derived the corresponding optimal permutation matrix , or subcarrier pairing scheme , for relaying scenarios with and without direct path for diversity .",
    "we further show the optimality of the so obtained permutation matrix among all unitary linear processing matrices for system achievable rate maximization .",
    "simulation results also demonstrate the gain can be achieved through optimal subcarrier pairing as compared to the non - optimal linear processing and non - pairing cases .",
    "we prove this by induction .",
    "we provide a brief description of the steps leading to the conclusion .    for @xmath101 , we need to show that the permutation matrix obtained from sorted subcarrier pairing is optimal . in order to do so , we first parameterize a @xmath102 unitary matrix and then find its optimal entries . from the general parametrization of unitary matrices @xcite , the @xmath102 unitary matrix @xmath19 can be represented by @xmath103 independent parameters @xmath104 substituting ( [ unitary ] ) in ( [ obj ] ) and taking derivative of the determinant with respect to four existing variables @xmath105 and @xmath106 of @xmath19 , we realize that the optimal @xmath107 , when @xmath108 and @xmath109 , or @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the other variables are canceled out in the determinant .",
    "this observation shows that in the case of @xmath101 , @xmath40 is a permutation matrix .",
    "assume this is true for @xmath110 .",
    "for @xmath111 , let @xmath112 , where subscript @xmath113 denotes the matrix dimension .",
    "since @xmath114 is a positive definite matrix , it has the following property @xcite [ ineq ] ( _ n+_n ) ( 1+a_nn)(_n-1+_n-1 ) where @xmath115 .",
    "re - arranging the expression of the determinant , we have ( _ n+_n ) = ( _ n + ^h^h^h ) let @xmath116 , @xmath117 with @xmath118^t$ ] , and @xmath119 .",
    "we have @xmath120^h |q_{n}|^2\\wbf_n \\\\                          |\\pbf|^2 \\odot \\wbf_n^h |q_1|^2 \\wbf_{n-1 } & ( |\\pbf|^2 \\odot \\wbf_n)^h |q_{n}|^2 \\wbf_n      \\end{pmatrix}\\nn \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        since @xmath126 , by the hardmard inequality , we have _ ( _ n-1+_n-1 ( ) ) = _ i^n-1 ( 1+|p_(i)|^2|q_(i)|^2 ) ) where both @xmath127 and @xmath128 are sorted in ascending order .",
    "thus ( _ n+_n ) ( 1+|p_(n)|^2|q_(n)|^2)_i^n-1 ( 1+|p_(i)|^2|q_(i)|^2 ) ) with equality if and only if @xmath129^t$ ] has entry 1 at the @xmath130th position .",
    "this implies that _",
    "n = [ _n-1 _ n ]  , where @xmath131 is @xmath132 with an additional row of zeros inserted at the @xmath130th row .",
    "hence , @xmath133 is a permutation matrix",
