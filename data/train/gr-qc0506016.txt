    "the classic vaidya metric @xcite ( see also @xcite followed by reprints of the original vaidya papers ) is a spherically symmetric type  d solution of the einstein equations in the presence of pure radiation matter field which propagates at the speed of light . in various contexts",
    "this `` null dust '' may be interpreted as high - frequency electromagnetic or gravitational waves , incoherent superposition of aligned waves with random phases and polarisations , or as massless scalar particles or neutrinos .",

    "can thus be constructed that are bounded either by flat ( @xmath2 ) or schwarzschild - like ( @xmath3 ) vacuum regions . due to this property",
    "such solutions have been extensively used as models of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a star , as an exterior solution describing objects consisting of heat - conducting matter , as an interesting toy model for investigation of singularities and their possible removal by quantum effects , for studies of various formulations of the cosmic censorship conjecture on both classical and quantum level , process of black - hole evaporation , and for other purposes ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details and related references ) .",
    "in fact , the vaidya spacetime belongs to a large robinson ",
    "trautman class of expanding nontwisting solutions @xcite .",
    "various aspects of this family have been studied in the last two decades . in particular , the existence , asymptotic behaviour and global structure of _ vacuum _ robinson  trautman spacetimes of type  ii with spherical topology were investigated @xcite , most recently in the works of chruciel and singleton @xcite . in these rigorous studies , which were based on the analysis of solutions to the nonlinear robinson  trautman equation for generic , arbitrarily strong smooth initial data ,",
    "the spacetimes were shown to exist globally for all positive retarded times , and to converge asymptotically to a corresponding schwarzschild metric .",
    "interestingly , extension across the `` schwarzschild - like '' event horizon can only be made with a finite order of smoothness .",
    "subsequently , these results were generalized in @xcite to the robinson ",
    "trautman vacuum spacetimes which admit a nonvanishing _ cosmological constant _ @xmath4 .",

    "trautman region across the horizon with a higher order of smoothness than in the corresponding case with @xmath5 . for the extreme value @xmath6 ,",
    "the extension is smooth but not analytic ( and not unique ) .",
    "the models with @xmath7 also exhibit explicitly the cosmic no - hair conjecture under the presence of gravitational waves .",

    "we will restrict ourselves to nonvacuum cases for which the dependence of the mass function @xmath0 on the null coordinate @xmath1 is only caused by a _ homogeneous _ pure radiation with the density @xmath30 .",
    "when the mass function @xmath31 is decreasing , the field equation ( [ feq ] ) can be naturally split into the following pair , @xmath32 in fact , it was demonstrated in @xcite that such a separation can always be achieved using the coordinate freedom .",

    "we will now investigate the smoothness of such an extension .",
    "it follows from ( [ fexpansion ] ) that the smoothness of @xmath79 on @xmath49 is only finite .",

    "for the pure vaidya metric characterized by @xmath112 and @xmath113 the first term vanishes identically so that the coordinates of ( [ krusk ] ) are indeed the kruskal - type coordinates for the vaidya spacetime with a linear mass function .",
    "the smoothness of a general robinson  trautman metric ( [ krusk ] ) depends only on the smoothness of the metric coefficients @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( containing the function @xmath79 ) since the coefficient @xmath116 tends to @xmath117 as @xmath118 .",

    "consequently , for @xmath121 being integer or non - integer number , the metric ( [ krusk ] ) is of the class @xmath122 or @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "we again observe that the spacetimes approaching the linear vaidya metric with naked singularity ( i.e. , for small values of the parameter @xmath54 ) possess higher order of smoothness at @xmath49 .",
    "one might be worried about the invariance of our results , namely with respect to a rescaling of the null coordinate @xmath124 leading to a different smoothness of the function @xmath79 and of the metric . in order to change",
    "the smoothness on the hypersurface @xmath49 such rescaling must have a singular character there .",
    "but this would lead to a degeneracy of the metric coefficient @xmath125 of the vaidya metric , which is forbidden .",
    "consequently , the above results are in this sense unique .",
    "we would like to obtain analogous results concerning smoothness of the extension also for a non - zero value of the cosmological constant @xmath23 .",
    "unfortunately , as far as we know , there is no _ explicit _ transformation of the vaidya  de sitter metric to the kruskal - type coordinates even for the linear mass function ( contrary to the schwarzschild  de  sitter case @xcite ) .",

    "we arrive at the double - null form for the metric @xmath130 of course , we have to ensure that @xmath131 in ( [ difer ] ) is a differential of the coordinate @xmath108 . the integrability condition ( @xmath132 )",
    "gives the following quasilinear pde , @xmath133 for the undetermined function @xmath134 , which is difficult to solve analytically .",

    "[ it is possible to apply the perturbative approach starting from the solvable case of the de sitter metric ( @xmath135 ) and then linearise the pde in the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the result , however , can not be presented in a useful closed form . ] for our purposes it suffices to use a general argumentation : the coordinate @xmath1 is already suitably compactified and we are only determining the complementary null coordinate @xmath108 to obtain the vaidya  de sitter metric in the kruskal - type coordinates ( which is smooth on @xmath49 ) . the corresponding robinson ",
    "trautman metric in these coordinates differs only by the term @xmath136 ( which is absent in the vaidya  de sitter case in the double null coordinates ) , and by a different metric coefficient @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is finite and smooth when approaching the hypersurface @xmath139 .",
    "the smoothness is thus not affected by the specific transformation ( [ difer ] ) and it is the same as for the vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "this is different from vacuum spacetimes with @xmath3 studied in @xcite because in the present case @xmath140 near @xmath49 , and the influence of  @xmath4 on the smoothness becomes negligible .",

    "now , by applying the substitution ( [ reparam ] ) in equation ( [ chrusciel ] ) we obtain @xmath143 ( where the dot denotes a differentiation ) which is the evolution equation for the function @xmath62 .",
