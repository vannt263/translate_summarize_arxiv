    "high resolution spectra of the h+d absorption in lyman limit systems towards distant quasars and the subsequent voigt profile fitting analysis [ vpf ] suggested a dispersion in the primordial hydrogen isotopic ratio d / h @xmath5 n()/n ( ) ( the ratio of the and column densities ) of about one order of magnitude ( see a short summary in burles & tytler 1998b ) .",

    "deuterium is created exclusively in bbn and therefore we can expect that the d / h ratio decreases with cosmic time due to conversion of d into @xmath6he and heavier elements in stars .",
    "it is clear that the precise measurements of the d / h values at high redshift are extremely important to probe whether bbn was homogeneous .",
    "the choice of the appropriate bbn model may in turn place constrains on different models of structure formation .",
    "the lack of information about the nature of the absorption line broadening mechanism means that we might obtain different values of d / h if we make different assumptions .",

    "if there are correlations in the velocity field , the velocity distribution along a given line of sight may deviated significantly from the gaussian model , i.e. @xmath9 .",
    "the application of the standard vpf analysis to such systems may then give incorrect d / h .",
    "we do not know , however , how to distinguish between the multicomponent microturbulent and one component mesoturbulent models if both of them show good fits to the spectral data .    to decide which model is",
    "better additional observations can be considered .",
    "for instance , if we assume that the lyman limit systems arise in the outer regions of intervening galactic halos , then direct observations of the large scale flows in the giant ly@xmath10 emission halos at @xmath11 ( van ojik _ et al .",

    "later burles & tytler ( 1998b , hereafter bt ) reconsidered this measurement including full coverage of the lyman series and better quality data above and below the lyman continuum break . besides bt used the new method to measure d / h in quasar absorption systems described in burles & tytler ( 1998a ) . considering six different microturbulent models , bt found d / h = @xmath22 which is consistent with their results on the @xmath3 system towards q19371009 where d / h = @xmath23 ( burles & tytler 1998a ) .",
    "neither measurement is consistent with the d / h at @xmath4 towards q1718 + 4807 deduced using the microturbulent model with a single component : d / h = @xmath24 ( webb _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , and d / h = @xmath25 ( tytler _ et al .",
    "this discord can be resolved using a more complex velocity model for q1718 + 4807 .",
    "tytler et al . (",
    "1998 ) considered a second velocity component with the microturbulent model , while levshakov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used a single component mesoturbulent model .    here",
    "we apply the mesoturbulent model to q1009 + 2956 , and we conclude that all three qsos may be described by a single value of d / h which is approximately equal to @xmath26 .",
    "the present study is primarily aimed at the inverse problem in the analysis of the h+d ly@xmath10 absorption . the higher order lyman series lines observed by bt ( ly@xmath27 , ly-6 , ly-12 , ly-13 , ly-14 , ly-20 , and ly-21 ) were also chosen in this analysis to restrict the set of possible velocity field configurations .",

    "the absorber is assumed to exhibit a mixture of bulk motions such as infall and outflows , tidal flows etc .",
    "then the motion along the sight - line may be characterized by a fluctuating velocity field that we consider as a continuous random function of the space coordinate , @xmath29 .    for simplicity , we assume a homogeneous density @xmath30 and temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we have only weak justifications for these assumptions , which are necessitated by the complexity of the analysis .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath31 may be supported by the fact that the states of thermally stable , optically thin interstellar gas take only restricted temperature ranges over a relatively wide range of density variations ( see , e.g. , donahue & shull 1991 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath30 seems to be quite plausible approximation for this particular @xmath0 system since observational data show that metal lines from different ions show similar profiles . in section  3",
    "we use the similarity of and profiles to estimate @xmath31 independently on the analysis of hydrogen lines .",
    "but these arguments do not rule out possible variations in @xmath31 and/or @xmath30 in general .",

    "as determined by bt ( without allowing for errors in the local continuum in the vicinity of each hydrogen line ) we found a few rmc profile fits which are listed in table  2 . we tried to find solutions with the reduced @xmath53 per degree of freedom of @xmath88 .",
    "for all models from table  2 the calculated hydrogen profiles are similar to that shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we do not find any large differences between calculated and real spectra .",
    "the under - absorption on the blue - ward side of d ly@xmath10 is probably caused by the ly@xmath10 forest lines .",
    "we do not treat this part of the spectrum because , in this case , unsaturated higher order lyman series lines provide accurate predictions for the velocity of the deuterium ly@xmath10 line and its shape .",
    "besides , as shown by bt , these additional absorptions do not affect significantly the d / h ratio in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the derived @xmath29 configurations are not unique .",
    "but their projections  the radial - velocity distribution functions @xmath89  are very much alike ( see examples in fig .  2 ) .",

    "both the rmc @xmath89 and the combined bt @xmath89 distributions show similar asymmetry .",
    "but the interpretation of these @xmath89 is different . in the microturbulent model",
    "the asymmetry is caused by the individual clouds with different physical parameters , whereas the mesoturbulent solution describes the homogeneously distributed gas with constant density and temperature along the sight - line .",

    "table  2 shows the spread of the @xmath31 values between 13700  k and 18100  k for different models .",
    "each of these models is acceptable from the statistical point of view . to select the adequate models",
    "additional observational data should be taken into account .",
    "for this purpose we consider below high snr data on the unsaturated and lines observed at the same @xmath0 towards q1009 + 2956 .",
    "we turn now to a brief discussion of the application of the entropy - regularized @xmath53-minimization [ erm ] procedure developed by levshakov _",
    "( 1998c , hereinafter lta ) to recover independently the kinetic temperature from the and data obtained by bt . we suppose that and metals from the same lyman limit system should give similar @xmath31 .",
    "the erm procedure utilizes complex but similar absorption line profiles of different ions to estimate a single value of @xmath31 for the whole absorbing region .",
    "the similarity of the complex profiles of ions with different masses and ionization potentials stems from the homogeneous gas density distribution along the sight - line , otherwise we would expect to observe different intensity fluctuations within the line profiles caused by variations of the local ionization parameter @xmath90 which is the ratio of the density of ionizing photons to the total gas density .",
    "we consider the complex structure of the absorption lines as being generated by the large scale motions with the correlated internal structure .",
    "satisfactory erm solutions ( @xmath88 ) for a pair of lines of different ions will only exist when the homogeneous density approximation is consistent with the spectra .",
    "the absorber in question is the outer part of the halo of a distant galaxy .",
    "the gas in the halo photo - ionized by qsos is optically thin in the lyman continuum . for such system",
    "the equilibrium temperature is weakly dependent on @xmath90 ( donahue & shull 1991 ) .",
    "we may expect , therefore , that a single @xmath31 is still a suitable approximation in this case .    to estimate @xmath31 for the particular @xmath0 system ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath721548 ( snr = 72 ) and @xmath721394 ( snr = 73 ) lines observed with 8  km  s@xmath16 spectral resolution ( fwhm ) by bt .",
    "we did not use the red components of these doublets because their data are more noisy . applying the erm procedure to the @xmath721548 and @xmath721394 lines",
    ", we obtained the gas temperature @xmath91  k.    figures  3 and 4 illustrate our results .",
    "the best - fitting profiles with three equidispersion components [ for definition see eq.(12 ) in lta ] are shown in panels @xmath92 and @xmath93 of fig .  3 by solid lines with the tick marks indicating the positions for the separate components .",
    "the choice of the appropriate @xmath91  k corresponding to the optimal value of the normalized regularization parameter @xmath94 is shown in fig .  4 .",
    "the objective function used in this case has the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a penalty function [ eq.(21 ) in lta ] and the regularization parameter @xmath10 is given by @xmath97 for this particular case @xmath98 and @xmath99 were chosen .",
    "the obtained erm estimation of @xmath91  k lies in the range of @xmath31 found by the rmc method from the h+d ly@xmath10 and higher order lyman series profiles . since the accuracy of the erm solutions is shown to be about 10% ( lta ) , models * a * , * e * , and * g * in table  2 seem to be consistent with the erm result .",
    "we have shown that the mesoturbulent model can explain the data adequately . in the following",
    "we discuss the relationship between the micro- and mesoturbulence models , and related issues .",
    "the mesoturbulent model assumes constant @xmath31 and @xmath30 but allows velocity correlations , while the microturbulent model allows different but constant @xmath31 and @xmath30 for each of a finite number of components and assumes no coherent structure in the velocity field .    in the microturbulent approach",
    "it is explicitly assumed that the radial velocities are normally distributed so that the line profile is every time uniquely determined .",
    "in contrast , in the mesoturbulent approach we do not make the assumption of a gaussian distribution for the radial velocities .",
    "this leads in turn to the concepts of randomness and unpredictability in the line formation process .",
    "that is to say , the apparent @xmath93-parameters usually measured in high resolution spectra may not be suitable to determine the true ratio @xmath100 which is used to estimate the relative importance of the non - thermal broadening ( see levshakov & kegel 1997 , for details ) .    in the two approaches ,",
    "the d / h ratios are found to be similar for the particular @xmath0 system .",
    "however , microturbulent models yield slightly lower deuterium abundance and rather narrow range ( @xmath101 15% ) of its uncertainty . in the mesoturbulent solutions , although the total hydrogen column densities lie inside the range found by bt , the d / h values are less restricted because , in general , the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath89 is not known _ a priori_. our analysis gives a certain range for n()@xmath102 and d / h due to the finite signal - to - noise ratio and different @xmath89 configurations .",
    "this is shown in fig .  5 where different confidence regions for this pair of physical parameters are depicted for models * a * , * e * , and * g * under the assumption that the other parameters @xmath33 , @xmath48 , @xmath50 and @xmath29 are fixed ( the computing procedure is described in levshakov et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the estimated d - abundance towards q1009 + 2956 [ d / h @xmath1 ] agrees within the errors of measurement with the rmc results for the absorption systems seen towards q1937 - 1009 [ d / h @xmath104  : levshakov _ et al . _",

    "_ 1998b , levshakov 1998 ] .    in general , accurate measurement of d / h requires ( @xmath62 ) correct modeling , ( @xmath106 ) treatment of continuum placement errors reported by burles & tytler ( 1998a , b ) , and ( @xmath107 ) treatment of contaminating absorption .",
    "we conclude that the current observations support sbbn and that there is no conflict with the d / h measurements in these three lyman limit systems .",
