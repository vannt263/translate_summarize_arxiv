    "<S> recent work on the complete wetting transition for three dimensional systems with short - ranged forces has emphasized the role played by the coupling of order - parameter fluctuations near the wall and depinning interface . it has been proposed that an effective two - field hamiltonian , which predicts a renormalisation of the wetting parameter , could explain the controversy between rg analysis of the capillary - wave model and monte carlo simulations on the ising model . in this </S>",
    "<S> letter results of extensive monte carlo simulations of the two - field model are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in agreement with prediction of a renormalized wetting parameter @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of long standing controversies in the study of phase equilibria at fluid interfaces , related to wetting transitions for systems with short - ranged forces at the marginal dimension @xmath1 ( for a recent review see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the standard model used to describe fluctuation effects at wetting transitions is the effective interfacial hamiltonian ( also called the capillary wave ( cw ) model ) @xmath2=\\int d{\\bf y } \\bigl[\\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta } ( t)}{2 }   ( \\nabla \\ell)^2 + w(\\ell)\\bigr]\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a collective coordinate which represents the distance of the fluctuating fluid interface ( separating bulk phases @xmath4 and @xmath5 , say ) from a wall situated in the @xmath6 plane . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the interfacial stiffness coefficient and @xmath8 is the effective binding potential which is usually specified as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the inverse bulk correlation length and @xmath11 is proportional to a bulk ordering field . at a critical or complete wetting transition </S>",
    "<S> the mean interface displacement @xmath12 ( and other lengthscales ) diverges as the external field approach critical values . for </S>",
    "<S> critical wetting , b is positive and the transition occurs at @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath14 , the wetting temperature , while for complete wetting @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 and the transition occurs for @xmath17 for @xmath18 . + one well known controversy concerns the critical wetting transition . for this case , </S>",
    "<S> rg calculations based on ( [ capillary ] ) ( see for example @xcite ) , predict strong non - universality for the critical exponents and amplitudes depending on the value of the wetting parameter @xmath19 at the transition temperature @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> however , extensive monte carlo simulations of wetting in a three dimensional ising model with nearest - neighbour interactions by binder , landau and kroll @xcite , show only small deviations from mean - field theory consistent with @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts sharply with the expected value @xmath22 ( at the temperature where the simulations were performed ) . </S>",
    "<S> prompted by the discrepancy gompper and kroll [ gk ] @xcite performed very accurate monte carlo simulations on a lattice version of ( [ capillary ] ) and found very good agreement with the renormalisation group treatment , leaving the controversy open . + more recently attention has focused on the complete wetting transition . for this case cw theory predicts that , while the critical exponents retain their mean - field values in the limit of @xmath17 , critical amplitudes are renormalised . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the mean distance @xmath12 diverges at leading order as @xmath23 where @xmath24 depends on @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular for @xmath25 , cw theory predicts @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a new controversy appeared with the ising model simulations of binder , landau and ferrenberg @xcite , ( at @xmath27 ) consistent with @xmath28 , while the cw model predicts only @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results serve to emphasize that wetting at the marginal dimension is a rather special case and that the coarse - grained hamiltonian ( [ capillary ] ) may not capture all the essential physics . </S>",
    "<S> note that no such problems arise in two dimensions where the cw model yields predictions for universal critical exponents , amplitudes and scaling functions which are in excellent agreement with the exact ising model results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this , several authors have undertaken a careful examination of the foundations of the rg theory and of the validity of the interfacial hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> in particular fisher and jin [ fj ] @xcite initiated a method of systematically deriving interfacial hamiltonian from an underlying landau - ginzburg - wilson [ lgw ] model . for critical wetting , they suggested that ( [ capillary ] ) should be modified by allowing a position dependent stiffness coefficient and as a result argue that the transition may in fact be very weakly first - order . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , parry and boulter [ pb ] @xcite argued that this is still not a sufficient modification of the cw model , since it does not account for fluctuations of the order parameter near the wall and depinning interface . </S>",
    "<S> following the methods by [ fj]@xcite , they introduced a two - field hamiltonian for complete wetting @xmath30=\\int d{\\bf y}\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\mu \\nu}(\\ell_1,\\ell_2 )   \\nabla \\ell_{\\mu}\\cdot \\nabla \\ell_{\\nu } + u(\\ell_1)+   w(\\ell_2-\\ell_1)\\}\\ ] ] which is a functional of two collective coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( representing the locations of generalised surfaces at the wall and the @xmath33 interface respectively ) and @xmath34 is a position dependent stiffness matrix @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the potential @xmath35 binds the lower surface to the wall and since the fluctuations of @xmath36 are small can be approximated by @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the the finite correlation length associated with the intrinsic fluctuations of the order parameter near the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations of @xmath31 are not included in the cw and fj models . </S>",
    "<S> the term @xmath40 is similar to the binding potential in ( [ potential ] ) . in the limit of complete wetting , @xmath41 unbinds from the wall while @xmath36 remains bound . in their rg analysis , </S>",
    "<S> [ pb ] show show that the coupling to a weakly fluctuating field results in an effective value of the wetting parameter . in the limit @xmath42 or @xmath43 the fluctuations of the lower surface </S>",
    "<S> are completely suppressed and the cw / fj result @xmath26 is recovered . in the other limit , @xmath44 or @xmath45 , the hamiltonian ( [ twoham ] ) can be written in terms of center of mass coordinates which gives an effective stiffness coefficient @xmath46 and results in a capillary parameter @xmath47 . for </S>",
    "<S> intermediate values of @xmath48 , linear @xcite and non - linear rg analysis @xcite predict that the effective capillary parameter is @xmath49 consequently , the critical amplitude @xmath24 is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a momentum cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> they estimated @xcite @xmath53 , which gives the prediction @xmath54 , in reasonable agreement with the ising simulations in the complete wetting regime . </S>",
    "<S> for the subsequent development in theory , it seems important that [ pb ] theory is tested by independent methods . </S>",
    "<S> the crucial prediction is that the capillary parameter is renormalised due to the coupling to a field @xmath31 which only weakly fluctuates . to this end , in this letter , the monte carlo studies of critical wetting by [ gk ] @xcite have been generalised to the two - field hamiltonian in the complete wetting regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the simulations were performed on a lattice version of ( [ twoham ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two surfaces @xmath36 and @xmath41 are modelled by two parallel @xmath55 square lattices with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the variables @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the distances of the site @xmath58 of the lower ( @xmath36 ) and upper ( @xmath41 ) surface respectively , from the wall ( located at zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> the uncoupled gradient terms are approximated by @xmath59 where @xmath60 indicate the four nearest - neighbours of the site @xmath58 and the sum is over all sites @xmath58 for @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are measured in units of the bulk correlation length @xmath64 . to test the program , the potential ( [ potential ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is first chosen as @xmath65 ( critical wetting ) , @xmath66 is set very large to suppress the fluctuations of the lower surface @xmath36 , the cross - gradient coupling term @xmath67 is kept to zero and @xmath68 takes the values given by [ gk ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in very good agreement with their founding . for complete wetting , </S>",
    "<S> the potential is chosen as @xmath69 and @xmath70 and the cross - gradient coupling term @xmath67 kept to zero @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice size @xmath71 is varied between @xmath72 and @xmath73 to study finite - size effects . </S>",
    "<S> the sos approximation is adopted and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are treated as continuous variables to avoid problems related to roughening . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we ignore the exponentially small position - dependence of the stiffness matrix elements since they play no role in determining the increment @xmath74 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hard wall condition ( @xmath75 ) is used here , although the prediction ( [ omega ] ) is also valid in a soft wall approximation @xcite ( see for example @xcite for a discussion regarding the cw model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wetting parameters are chosen as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and so the maximum increment to @xmath24 is @xmath78 ( corresponding to @xmath79 ) . </S>",
    "<S> + a metropolis algorithm has been used on a dec alpha 3600 . at each monte carlo sweep </S>",
    "<S> , one of the two surfaces is chosen at random @xmath80 times , and then a randomly picked site @xmath58 is updated by a random number in the interval @xmath81 $ ] ; @xmath82 is set so that approximately 50% of the updates are accepted ( but other values have also been used to test the convergence rate ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first @xmath83 sweeps are discarded to thermalise the system and @xmath84 sweeps are used to calculate the averages . </S>",
    "<S> the block average method is used to obtain statistical errors and the integrated autocorrelation time @xmath85 is calculated as in madras and sokal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example for the parameter @xmath86 and field @xmath87 , @xmath88 and for @xmath89 , @xmath90 , while for @xmath91 and field @xmath87 , @xmath92 and for @xmath89 , @xmath93 . for a given value of </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath48 the average distance @xmath94 of the upper surface from the wall , is calculated for several values of the fields @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , to approximate the limiting value @xmath96 or @xmath97 , @xmath48 is set at @xmath86 . in figure @xmath98 , @xmath94 is plotted against @xmath99 as in eq.([meanl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath94 lie on a straight - line and a logarithmic regression gives a slope @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> the other limit , @xmath101 or @xmath102 , is approximated by @xmath103 . for smaller values of @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations become very large , the autocorrelations increase and the simulations are not reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath94 , plotted against @xmath99 in figure @xmath98 , show that they lie on a straight - line , but now with a slope @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> figure @xmath98 suggest that @xmath24 is @xmath48 dependent and other intermediate values of @xmath48 are chosen to show this . in figure @xmath106 are plotted the fitted values of the slopes @xmath24 corresponding to different values of @xmath48 for lattice sizes @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the graph shows that the value of @xmath24 is indeed larger than the cw prediction @xmath108 for finite values of @xmath48 , consistent with ( [ theta ] ) . due to the dependence on the cutoff </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 a precise quantitative comparison between simulation and theory is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless a fit of the numerical results to the theoretical prediction ( [ theta ] ) yields a value for the cutoff @xmath52 close to unity , which is encouraging . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that as @xmath104 increases , the increment @xmath74 decreases and we recover the cw model prediction @xmath29 as @xmath109 . for small @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> the measured value of @xmath24 is considerably bigger than the cw result and increases non - linearly with @xmath110 . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> , the limiting value should be @xmath111 , but this can not be reached in the simulations since it corresponds to infinite fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , extrapolation to @xmath112 is not possible either , given the non - linear dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath48 and large finite - size effects which would occur in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the observed increase of @xmath24 with @xmath104 testifies to the strong influence of the coupling between the two fields and is certainly consistent with the basic prediction of the coupled hamiltonian theory . </S>",
    "<S> + in the light of [ pb ] theory @xcite , the results are interpreted as follow : for very large values of @xmath48 the lower surface is very stiff and it does not fluctuate , hence the capillary wave result of @xmath113 is recovered . for decreasing values of @xmath48 , even small fluctuations in the lower surface </S>",
    "<S> coupled to the upper surface produce a change in the critical amplitude @xmath24 as predicted by the theory and also in agreement with the ising model simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first time that rg predictions of an effective hamiltonian , simulations on the ising model and simulations of the same effective hamiltonian are in qualitatively and quantitatively agreement . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to extend this work to critical wetting and investigate if ( [ twoham ] ) can shed light on the controversy there . </S>",
    "<S> however this is beyond the scope of the present letter . </S>"
