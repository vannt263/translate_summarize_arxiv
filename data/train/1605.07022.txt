    "adjacent to the interface between an electrolyte solution and a charged solid surface , an electrical double layer is formed .",
    "the thickness of the double layer ranges from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers , depending on the salt concentration . since the ion concentration in the electrical double layer is highly inhomogeneous and the local charge neutrality",
    "is broken , interaction with an externally applied electric field can cause a driving force acting on the electrolyte solution . the driving force is the main factor for electrokinetic effects , such as the electro - migration of colloid particles and the electro - osmotic flow inside microchannels  @xcite , which are especially conspicuous in small - scale systems .",
    "micro- and nano - fabrication techniques have developed greatly in recent years , and so researchers have been able to control and use electrokinetic phenomena in engineering applications . for example , an electro - osmotic pump without moving parts  @xcite and an energy - harvesting device using the driving force induced by the salt - concentration gradient  @xcite have been proposed very recently . along with the expectations for engineering applications , fundamental research relevant to electrokinetic phenomena in small - scale systems , ranging from nano- to micrometers , has also attracted attention  @xcite .",
    "particularly , the advances in observing and processing techniques have prompted research focusing on surface properties such as roughness and structure  @xcite .    in the present study , to clarify the effects of surface properties on electrokinetic phenomena , we investigate electro - osmotic flows between two surfaces , which have a periodic structure and a non - uniform charge distribution , by means of both numerical and analytical approaches .",
    "the numerical analysis is based on the coupled lattice boltzmann method for solving the navier ",
    "stokes equations , the nernst  plank equation , and the poisson equation  @xcite .",
    "the numerical solutions to these equations , i.e. , the electrolyte flow , the ion concentrations , and the electrical field , are directly obtained . in the analytical approach ,",
    "the lubrication approximation theory  @xcite is applied to the system with electrical double layers of finite thickness , to derive a model equation that predicts the flow rate under the assumption of moderate variation of the surface structure along the channel . with these approaches ,",
    "we investigate the electro - osmotic flow in microchannels formed by the surfaces that are undulated and ( a ) charged negatively at a constant surface charge density or ( b ) charged non - uniformly along the channel such that the net surface charge vanishes . for both cases ,",
    "the electro - osmotic flow rate is evaluated and the dependency on geometrical parameters , such as the amplitude of the surface shape , is discussed .",
    "let us consider a channel between two walls , each of which has a periodic structure of period @xmath0 in the @xmath1 direction .",
    "the positions of the interfaces are expressed as @xmath2 ( fig .",

    "planck model @xcite , where the first , second , and third terms on the right - hand side of the flux equation are the contributions of electrochemical migration , diffusion , and convection of the electrolyte solution , respectively .",
    "finally , the electrical potential @xmath27 is governed by the following poisson equation : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the dielectric constant of the electrolyte solution .",
    "the local charge density @xmath30 is defined in terms of the ion concentration as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is faraday s constant . with this local charge density , the body force @xmath33 in eq .",

    "reduces to the poisson  boltzmann equation . in the electrokinetic flows considered in the present paper , however , although the convection term is sufficiently small , specifying a unique potential value at @xmath35 is difficult because of the external potential gradient .",
    "we therefore apply the original set of equations described here in the numerical simulations in section  [ sec_result ] .",
    "then the ion distribution affected by the external potential is obtained as shown in section  [ ssec_distributed ] , which the poisson ",

    "for the flow velocity , the ordinary non - slip condition is assumed at the solid - liquid interface :    @xmath37    note that in nano - scale flows , the simple non - slip condition is not sufficient and so a model describing the slip taking place at the interface is necessary . however , since the scale of the problems considered in the present paper is relatively large ( at a scale of micrometers ) , we assume the non - slip condition to be valid . for the ion concentration , no flux goes across the boundary , which is formulated simply as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the unit normal vector pointing inward to the fluid region . if we substitute eq .   into eq .",
