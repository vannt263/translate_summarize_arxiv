    "gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , are extremely energetic transient events , visible from the most distant parts of the universe . when a newly born black hole forms , either via the core collapse supernova , or after the merger of two compact stars , a large amount of matter is accreted onto it within the timescale between tens of milliseconds , to thousands of seconds , with a highly hyper - eddington rates @xcite . in such conditions , the nuclear reactions inside the plasma",
    "lead to creation of neutrinos , mainly via the electron - positron capture on nucleons .",
    "the annihilation of neutrino - antineutrino pairs is a source of power to the relativistic jets launched along the axis of the disk - black hole system .",
    "this can be comparable to the power extracted on the cost of the black hole spin , with the disk mediated by the magnetic fields .",
    "both neutrinos and magnetic fields in the accreting matter can drive the wind outflow from the disk surface , and act as a collimation mechanism for the relativistic jets ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the latter , are then the sites of the high - energy radiation produced at large distances from the engine , on the cost of the magnetic reconnection and conversion of the jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the outer parts of the disc , the heavy elements can be formed , and then the isotopes are prone to the radioactive decay @xcite .",
    "this may in the future bring observable effects on the measured hard x - ray spectra of grbs @xcite as well as the additional peaks in the blue and infrared bands a few days after the prompt grb emission @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gamma ray bursts contribute in this way to the galactic chemical evolution @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions in this engine , its density , temperature , and electron fraction , depend on the global parameters of the flow , such as the amount of matter and accretion rate , black hole mass and its spin , and the magnetic field .",
    "these conditions in turn will affect the total abundances of heavier elements synthesized within the flow .",
    "therefore , a possible detection of weak gamma ray burst signatures , apart from its gamma ray fluence , could give a constraint on the black hole parameters .",
    "these , in turn , can now be independently estimated , if the black hole is born via a merger event , detectable in the gravitational wave interferometer .",
    "numerical computations of the structure and evolution of the accretion flow in the gamma ray bursts engine begun with steady - state , and time - dependent models , which were axially and vertically averaged , and based on the classical prescription for visocisty with the so - called @xmath1-parameter @xcite .",
    "more recently , these accretion flows are being described by fully relativistic , mhd computations @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the central engine of a gamma ray burst , which is composed of a stellar mass , rotating black hole and accreting torus that has formed from the remnant matter at the base of the grb jet .",
    "we compute the time - dependent , two dimensional model of the rotationally supported , magnetized disc , rapidly accreting onto the center .",
    "the simulation is based on the harm ( high accuracy magnetohydrodynamics ) scheme , which works on the stationary metric around black hole and integrates the total energy equation and updates the set of conserved variables , i.e. comoving density , energy - momentum , magnetic field @xcite .    the basic version of the harm scheme was designed to model the accretion flows in the centers of galaxies , where the gas equation of state is with a good accuracy that of an ideal gas and can be described usin an adiabatic relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our current dynamical model",
    ", we use the non - ideal equation of state , computed on the basis of the @xmath2-equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we allow for the partial degeneracy of relativistic nucleons , electrons and positrons in the accreting plasma , and we compute the neutrino cooling rate due to the weak interaction processes , electron - positron pair anihillation , as well as bremsstrahlung and plasmon decay . here , we first incorporate this detailed microphysics into the heart of the gr mhd scheme .",
    "the neutino cooling was computed already from the nuclear reaction balance in the context of gamma ray bursts in our previous work @xcite .",
    "however , in that work , still the simple , adiabatic relation for the pressure ( @xmath3 , with @xmath4 ) was used , and only the internal energy in the evolution was updated during the simulation . in the current model , we mainly address the question of microphysics in the accretion flow , and also we are now able to more self - consistently estimate the efficientcy of the neutrino cooling in the disk .",
    "we check , if it is capable of powering the relativist jets in the gamma ray bursts , now in the case of a rather weak magnetic field .",
    "we also check the effect of the rotation speed of the black hole .",
    "in addition , we analyze the structure , velocity and amount of mass loss through the uncollimated winds launched from the accretion disc . finally , we examine the resulting nucleosynthesis in the body of the disk , which can occur already at small distances from the black hole , as well as in the uncollimated winds , and we show that the accretion flow can be the site of significant heavy element production .    the article is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we describe our mhd model of the grb central engine . in   [ sec : results ] , we present the results , describing the structure of the torus and the effects of adopted microphysics treatment .",
    "we also discuss the power transferred to the jets via the neutrino anihillation in comparison with the energy extracted to power the grb jets from the magnetic fields dragged through the bh horizon . in ",
    "[ sec : nucleo ] we describe the process of heavy elements formation in the outskirts of the torus in the grb central engine .",
    "we present the resulting abundances of elements computed under the assumption of nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "finally , we compare our results with the previous simulations .",

    "the model computations are based on the axisymmetric , general relativistic mhd code _",
    "harm-2d _ ,",
    "described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it uses a conservative , shock - capturing scheme , and provides solver for the continuity and energy - momentum conservation equations , assuming a force - free approximation .",
    "here we use our own version of this code , which we supplemented with the numerical routines to compute the equation of state and rate of cooling by neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino cooling processes adopted in our computations are the reactions of electron and positron capture on nucleons , the electron - positron pair anihillation , nucleon bremsstrahlung and plasmon decay .",
    "these reactions are : @xmath5 and their reaction rates are given by appropriate integrals @xcite in addition , the neutrinos are produced due to the electron - positron pair anihillation , bremsstrahlung , plasmon decay , in the following reactions : @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 we calculate their rates numerically , with proper integrals over the distribution function of relativistic , partially degenerate species . finally , the total neutrino cooling rate is given by the two - stream approximation @xcite , and includes the scattering and absorptive optical depths for neutrinos of the three flavors : @xmath9 and is expressed in the units of erg s@xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "the structure of a magnetized accreting torus in which the above reactions take place and the gas looses energy via neutrino cooling , was investigated in our previous paper @xcite . in that work , however , the neutrino cooling rate was used to update in every time step only the internal energy in the plasma , and the pressure was still approximately computed from the adiabatic relation , @xmath12 , with constant @xmath4 , which simplifies a lot the gr mhd scheme .",
    "the leptons and baryons are relativistic in the grb engine , and may have an arbitrary degeneracy level , so we compute the gas pressure using the fermi - dirac distribution of the species .",
    "also , neutrinos may contribute to the pressure due to the fact that they are scattered and absorbed , similarly to the photons and ( rather negligibly small in the geb case ) radiation pressure component . in the total pressure , we include now the contributions from the free nucleons , pairs , radiation , trapped neutrinos , and also from the helium nuclei .",

    "in contrast to the non - relativistic mhd , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 have a closed - form solution , in relativistic mhd , @xmath41 is a complicated , nonlinear relation .",

    "the inverse transformation requires to solve a set of 5 non - linear equations , which is done by a multi - dimensional newton - raphson routine .",
    "the procedure is simple , if the pressure is given by an adiabatic relation with density .",

    "the initial conditions introduced from the pressure equilibrium solution are relaxed after about @xmath56 ( in dimensionless units , with @xmath57 ) , and then the flow is evolves to the form the dynamically driven , geometrically thin flow , which is accreting through the black hole horizon . in the example figure",
    "[ fig : hdisk ] , we plot the radial profiles of the torus thickness for the cooled torus , at four time snapshots .",

    "the maximum thickness at the time @xmath62 increases to about 10 - 14 @xmath61 , for this range of spins . also , as the figure [ fig : hdisk ] shows , it is shifted to the outer boundary , while the torus no longer keeps its equilibrium doughnut shape .",

    "the snapshots from our simulation were taken at time @xmath62 , which for the adopted black hole mass is equivalent to about 0.03 s. the maps present the rest mass density @xmath69 , gas temperature @xmath70 , and magnetic pressure to gas pressure ratio @xmath2 , over - plotted with magnetic field lines .",

    "the disk winds are sweeping the gas out from the system , both in the equatorial plane and at higher latitudes .",
    "we identified the regions of the wind in the computation domain by defining three conditions that must be satisfied simultaneously , to distinguish the wind from the torus main body , and from the magnetized jets : ( i ) the radial velocity of the plasma is positive ( ii ) the density is smaller than @xmath72 g @xmath73 and ( iii ) the gas pressure is dominant , @xmath74 .",

    "the temperature of the wind in the neutrino cooled models is in the range of @xmath81 k. such high temperatures , above the threshold for electron - positron pair production , @xmath82 k , are the key condition for neutrino emission processes .",
    "the neutrino cooling is then efficient , as it only weakly depends on density . in the clumps with @xmath83 g @xmath11 ,",
    "the nuclear processes lead to neutrino production , while the optical depths for their absorption are very small .",
    "the effect of the wind is the mass loss from the system .",
    "we estimated quantitatively the evolution of the mass during the simulation .",
    "the total mass removed from the torus during the simulation , calculated by integrating the density over the total volume , differs from the total mass accreted onto the black hole ( i.e. the time integrated mass accretion rate through the inner boundary , subtracted from the initial mass ) .",
    "this may depend on the black hole spin .",
    "for the model with @xmath68 , the simulation was ended when the total mass in the volume dropped below @xmath84 .",
    "the starting mass at @xmath85 , was equal to @xmath86 . during the simulation",
    ", about 0.014 solar masses was accreted onto the black hole ( which makes 20% of the initial mass ) , and the rest , about 6% , was lost from the computation domain in the outflows .",
    "for larger black hole spins , the fraction of mass lost through wind can reach about 10% .",
    "the values for all the models are collected in table [ table : models ] .",

    "they are present in a narrow region along the polar axis , where the open magnetic field lines have formed .",
    "velocity field is directed there outwards , and the gas is expelled from the black hole region with the velocity that is nearly at the speed of light .      the total neutrino luminosity in the function of time is shown in figure [ fig : neurate3 ] , where we present the results for the black hole mass of 3 @xmath65 and torus of @xmath87 .",

    "the luminosity of the densest parts of the torus , estimated by weighing the total emissivity by the plasma density , is only on the order of @xmath96 erg s@xmath10 .",
    "this is because the total opacity for neutrino absorption and scattering in this regions reaches @xmath97 . and the neutrinos are trapped in the dense plasma .",
    "the power and luminosity available through the blandford - znajek process @xcite is calculated from the electromagnetic stress tensor , given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the magnetic four - vector , with @xmath100 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the four - velocity .",

    "we consider only the flux , which is dragged inwards through the black hole horizon , and we also check the magnetization of the plasma there , @xmath106 , where @xmath69 is the rest mass density of the gas . we impose a condition of @xmath107 , otherwise the blandford - znajek power is set to be zero .",
    "the resulting bz luminosities in the function of time for the range of black hole spin values in different models are presented in figure [ fig : lbz_sbhc ] .",
    "as the figure shows , the continuous power supply to the jet on the order of above @xmath108 erg s@xmath10 is available only for the highly spinning black holes .",
    "if the spin is moderate , @xmath109 , then the power @xmath110 erg s@xmath10 is injected .",
    "episodically , the power drops to zero , when there is no magnetization on the black hole horizon .",
    "therefore , the power injection can be separated by the intervals of the bz - quiescence , which can be longer if the black hole spin is small .    , torus mass @xmath111 .",
    "the black hole spin values are marked in the panels , and range from a=0.6 , to a= 0.98 , from bottom to top panels , width=264 ]    the exact values of the bz - luminosity at the end of the simulations are given in table [ table : models ] .",

    "still , the detection of such an afterglow emission will be a hint of the existence of a black hole in the engine site .",
    "measurements of nucleosynthesis products signatures may help constrain the model parameters for such engine , namely the black hole spin and its mass .",
    "the recent detections of the gravitational wave signal @xcite confirmed independently the existence of black holes in the universe .",
    "the analysis of the gravitational wave signal allows to constrain the black hole mass and spin ( with some uncertainty ) . in the case of the source gw150914",
    ", it was found that the signal is related to the merger of binary black hole .",
    "so far , the electromagnetic counterpart for this first event , was tentatively reported only by fermi satellite , who gave a limit for detection of a weak gamma ray signal @xcite .",
    "no infrared emission was reported , and also the signal was not confirmed by other gamma - ray missions for the case of this burst @xcite .    nevertheless , the detection of the electromagnetic counterpart of a gravitational wave source in the future events is appealing .",
    "the related estimates for the heavy elements synthesized in the ejecta could help constrain the parameters for the grb engine , if the latter happens to coincide with the gravitational wave source . in particular , if the binary black holes merge within a remnant circumbinary disk , which is a leftover after the past supernova explosion @xcite , then the nucleosynthesis of elements within the disk engine and ejected winds can be responsible also for an infrared counterpart .",
    "direct measurements of the escaping gamma - rays , which will be produced at larger distance in the r - process nucleosynthesis , are probably difficult with current x - ray and gamma - ray missions @xcite .    the black hole , which was the product of the merger of two black holes of about 29 and 36 solar mass black holes , was also a moderately spinning one . the constraints for its dimensionless spin parameter obtained from the amplitude and phase evolution of the observed gravitational waveform gave a value of @xmath112 , while the final black hole mass was equal to @xmath113 .",
    "as can be shown , such a binary black hole merger , if accompanied by the matter accretion onto a rotating black hole , which happens either before , or after the merger , can lead to an unusual gamma ray burst @xcite . in the case of the relatively small rate of the black hole rotation , such as in gw150914",
    ", the accretion will result in a very small electromagnetic flux dragged through the black hole horizon and hence negligibly small power of the blandford - znajek process .",
    "we computed an additional set of the gamma ray burst engine models , with parameters taken to be representative for the above scenario ( see table [ table : models_lbh ] ) .",
    ", its spin is a=0.9 , and torus mass is about 15 @xmath65.,width=302 ]    we have also computed the mass fraction distribution of heavy elements produced in this putative engine ( figure [ fig : nse2dm62 ] ) .",
    "we found , that contrary to the presented above fiducial models , with a standard ( small ) black hole mass and accretion torus , here the nuclear conditions preferably lead to production of mainly iron peak elements . in the model _ lbhd _ ( see table [ table : models_lbh ] ) , the mass fraction of iron 56 reached almost 1.0 , while the isotopes from the group of selenium and manganese were @xmath114 times less abundant .",
    "this result suggests a possible additional test for the conditions present in the grb engine , e.g. , if the event happened to be coincident with a merger of the two @xmath115 black holes with masses of about @xmath115 each . more generally , the gravitational waves discovery may reveal the new population of weak gamma ray bursts originating from the low lorentz factor jets . in this case , the prompt electromagnetic emission may be difficult to discover , but the observation of a radioactive decay of elements produced in the engine of the grb may be confronted with the engine simulation predictions .",
