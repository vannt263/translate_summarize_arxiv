    "the nucleon excitation spectrum is a valuable source of information about baryon structure .",
    "the @xmath2 transition presents clear advantages from the experimental point of view since the @xmath5 is separated from the rest of resonances .",
    "the bulk of the existing information on the weak @xmath2 transition form factors ( ff ) comes from the analysis of the anl @xcite and bnl @xcite experiments , performed with @xmath4 beams , whose energies span from 0.5 to 6.0  gev with poorly known distributions . nowadays , with the advent of the new generation of electron accelerators in the gev region and achieving high luminosities , it is possible to perform electron scattering experiments in the resonance region .",
    "we have considered the possibility to extend these studies to the weak charged current physics .",
    "for this reason , we have studied the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the typical energies of mami and tjnaf , and using the available information about the ff  @xcite .",
    "since the vector @xmath2 ff are related to the isovector electromagnetic ones , which can be obtained from electroproduction data , these experiments would allow to study the axial ff and , in particular , the dominant @xmath8 .",
    "the determination of its value at @xmath9 is important in view of the discrepancies between the pcac prediction and theoretical estimates obtained in most quark models @xcite .",
    "we have used the low @xmath3 bnl data on the ratio of @xmath10 and @xmath11 events from @xmath12 collisions to extract the value of the axial vector coupling @xmath13 , taking into account the deuteron structure and the @xmath5 width  @xcite .",
    "the study of weak @xmath2 transitions in nuclei is relevant for the analysis of atmospheric neutrino experiments .",
    "in fact , the energy distribution of the part of the atmospheric @xmath7 flux producing fully contained events at kamiokande is such that @xmath14  mev , well above the @xmath5 production threshold .",
    "these @xmath5 s decay into pions and photons ( through @xmath15 decay ) , that are a source of background . for this reason",
    ", we have studied the impact of nuclear effects in @xmath16 production of @xmath5 in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the matrix element for the process @xmath17 is proportional to the product of the leptonic and hadronic currents .",
    "the hadronic current is expressed in terms of vector and axial vector ff @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .",

    "in order to obtain @xmath13 we have evaluated the ratio @xmath53 at @xmath54  gev , which is the mean energy of the bnl @xmath4 spectrum ; the @xmath5 production cross section has been calculated in the impulse approximation , and using the deuteron wave function of the paris potential . the quasielastic cross section , in the same approximation , is taken from ref .",
    "we found that , in the data region i.e. at @xmath55  gev@xmath45 , deuteron effects are negligible and , hence , one can treat the bnl data as if they were data on the ratio of the free reactions @xmath56 at @xmath57 , @xmath58 is given by the quotient of = ( c^a_5)^2 g^2 ^2_c d k^0 and the well known expression for the forward quasielastic cross section . equating this ratio to the experimental value @xmath59 @xcite , we obtain @xmath60 ;",
    "this result is consistent with the value given by the off - diagonal goldberger - treiman relation .",
    "the proper inclusion of the @xmath5 width causes a 30  % reduction of the cross section and can not be neglected in the extraction of @xmath61 .",
    "when the reactions @xmath64 and @xmath65 take place in the nucleus , the nucleon momentum is constrained within a density dependent fermi sea .",
    "the produced @xmath5 does not have this constraint , but its decay is inhibited by the pauli blocking of the final nucleon . on the other side , there are other disappearance channels open through particle - hole excitations .",
    "the situation is well described if one replaces in the @xmath5 propagator @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the pauli blocked decay width and @xmath69 is the @xmath5 selfenergy in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "the pions produced inside the nucleus are rescattered and absorbed in their propagation through the nucleus .",
    "the absorption coefficient required to estimate the produced pion flux has been calculated in the eikonal approximation , taking the pion energy dependent mean free path from ref .  @xcite . for the @xmath2 transition ff ,",
