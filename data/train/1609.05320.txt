    "the notion of the _ sensitivity complexity _ of a boolean function ( see definition in section @xmath2 ) , or just _ sensitivity _ , has been widely studied , since introduced by cook and dwork in @xcite , where it was used to derive tight lower bounds for the running time of a pram computing boolean function @xmath3 .",
    "simon @xcite proved that if all of @xmath3 s coordinates have positive influence , one has the lower bound of @xmath4 .",
    "this bound is known to be asymptotically tight , as demonstrated by the so called _ monotone address function_.    there have been attempts to find lower bounds for the sensitivity of certain classes of boolean functions .",
    "in particular , the class of _ weakly symmetric _ functions has been studied . for this class ,",
    "the best known lower bound is @xmath4 for any non - constant weakly symmetric function @xmath3 in @xmath0 variables .",
    "indeed , for weakly symmetric functions all coordinates have the same influence , from which it follows that all coordinates have positive influences if @xmath3 is also non - constant , and as we have already mentioned , this guarantees @xmath4 .    yet , so far ,",
    "every non - constant weakly symmetric function @xmath3 found , has sensitivity @xmath5 .",
    "turan conjectured in @xcite that there exists some absolute constant @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 for any non - constant weakly symmetric boolean function .",
    "perhaps the main open problem regarding sensitivity , is its relation to the seemingly similar notion of _ block sensitivity _ ( see section @xmath2 for definition ) .",
    "nisan and szegedy posed the conjecture @xcite in @xmath8 that the two are polynomially equivalent .",
    "this would have important implications , since block sensitivity is known to be polynomially equivalent to many important measures of the complexity of a function , including _ decision tree complexity _",
    ", _ certificate complexity _ , _ degree _ as a real polynomial , _ quantum query complexity _ etc .",
    "finding bounds on the separations between pairs of the aforementioned measures is a lively field ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "while at the moment block sensitivity can only be shown to be exponentially upper bounded by sensitivity @xcite , the largest known gap is quadratic , as shown first by @xcite . for an excellent survey on the sensitivity conjecture ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity conjecture implies turan s conjecture on weakly symmetric functions , because if @xmath3 is weakly symmetric , then @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "turan , in the same paper @xcite , studied the sensitivity of _ graph properties_. he showed that for any non - trivial graph property @xmath3 for @xmath0 vertices ( and so , @xmath10 boolean variables ) , @xmath11 .",
