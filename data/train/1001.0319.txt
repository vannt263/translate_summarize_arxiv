    "the accurate and reliable simulation of wave propagations in unbounded media is of fundamental importance in a wide range of applications .",
    "the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) approach @xcite has proved a flexible and accurate method for the simulation of waves .",
    "it consists in surrounding the computational domain by an absorbing layer , which generates no reflections at its interface with the computational domain ; hence , it is perfectly matched .",
    "inside the absorbing layer a damping term is added to the wave equation , which acts only in the direction perpendicular to the layer .",
    "this approach is analogous to the physical treatment of the walls of an anechoic chamber and provides an alternative to absorbing or nonrelfecting boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "+ the initial pml formulation of brenger @xcite was based on splitting the electromagnetic fields into two parts , the first containing the tangential derivatives and the second containing the normal derivatives ; damping was then enforced only upon the normal component . later abarbanel and gottlieb @xcite showed that brenger s approach was only weakly well - posed due to the unphysical splitting of the field variables .",
    "several strongly well - posed approaches have been suggested since , some of which were shown to be linearly equivalent @xcite .",
    "+ the pml approach has proved very successful in practice , because of its simplicity , versatility , and robust treatment of corners .",
    "once discretized and truncated at a finite thickness , the layer is no longer perfectly absorbing and the optimal damping parameters need to be determined via numerical experiments .",
    "stability properties of the pml approach has been analyzed in several works , such as in @xcite among others .",
    "+ the best implementation in the time domain is still under debate .",
    "most pml formulations require wave equations stated in their standard second - order form to be reformulated as first - order hyperbolic systems , thereby introducing many additional unknowns . here",
    "we propose instead a simple pml formulation directly for the second - order wave equation both in two and in three space dimensions .",
    "our formulation also requires fewer auxiliary variables than previous formulations for the second - order wave equation ",
    "see @xcite , for instance .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we derive a pml formulation for the wave equation in its standard second - order form . by judiciously choosing the auxiliary variables in the laplace transformed domain ,",
    "the resulting pml modified equations require only two auxiliary variables in two dimensions and four auxiliary variables in three dimensions inside the absorbing layer .",
    "next , in section 3 we prove stability of our pml formulation by using standard theory from @xcite .",
    "the finite difference discretization of the pml modified wave equation is shown in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "our numerical results both in two and three space dimensions demonstrate the accuracy and long time stability of the pml formulation .",
    "we consider a time dependent wave field @xmath0 propagating through unbounded three dimensional space and assume that all sources and initial disturbances are confined to the rectangular domain @xmath1\\times[-a_2 , a_2]\\times[-a_3 , a_3]$ ] , @xmath2 .",
    "outside @xmath3 , we further assume the speed of propagation @xmath4 to be constant ; hence , all waves are purely outgoing in the unbounded exterior @xmath5 . inside @xmath3 , the wave field",
    "@xmath6 satisfies @xmath7      \\label{eq : wave3 }      u & = u_0 & \\qquad & t = 0 , \\\\[0.1 cm ]      \\label{eq : wave4 }       u_t   & = v_0 & \\quad & t = 0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we wish to truncate the unbounded exterior and thereby restrict the computation to the finite computational domain @xmath3 . in doing so",
    ", we need to ensure that all waves propagating outward leave @xmath3 without spurious reflection .",
    "thus we shall surround @xmath3 by a perfectly matched layer ( pml ) of thickness @xmath8 , @xmath9 , in each coordinate which is designed to absorb the waves exiting @xmath3 . inside the absorbing layer , @xmath0 then satisfies a modified wave equation whose solutions decay exponentially fast with distance from the computational domain .",
    "+ following @xcite , we let @xmath10 denote the laplace transform of @xmath0 , defined as @xmath11 outside @xmath3 , @xmath10 then satisfies the helmholtz equation , @xmath12 next , we introduce the coordinate transformation @xmath13 where the damping profile @xmath14 is positive inside the absorbing layer , @xmath15 , @xmath9 , but vanishes inside @xmath3 .",
    "if we now require @xmath10 to satisfy the modified helmholtz equation in those stretched coordinates , @xmath16 it is well - known that @xmath0 will remain unaltered inside @xmath3 , but decay exponentially fast inside the layer ; hence the absorbing layer will be perfectly matched .",
    "in fact , the ( unsplit ) pml modified helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helmholtz1_modification ] ) in the laplace transformed domain is standard @xcite .",
    "the difficulty lies in transforming ( [ eq : helmholtz1_modification ] ) back to the time domain , without introducing high order derivatives or too many auxiliary variables .",
    "+ from @xmath17 , we observe that partial differentiation with respect to @xmath18 is related to partial differentiation with respect to the physical coordinate , @xmath19 , through @xmath20 we now let @xmath21 , @xmath22 denote @xmath23 then , by replacing partial derivatives according to ( [ eq : tsfm ] ) and multiplying the resulting expression by @xmath24 , we rewrite ( [ eq : helmholtz1_modification ] ) in physical coordinates as @xmath25 from ( [ eq : gamma ] ) we derive after some algebra the following identities : @xmath26 by using ( [ eq : gamma_algbra ] ) in ( [ eq : helmholtz2 ] ) we find @xmath27 next , we introduce the auxiliary functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 finally , we use the above relations in ( [ eq : hholtz3 ] ) and transform the resulting equations back to the time domain , which yields the pml modified wave equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 in the interior of @xmath3 , the damping profiles @xmath34 and the auxiliary variables @xmath35 , @xmath28 vanish ; hence , ( [ pml - eq_3d ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : wave1 ] ) in @xmath3 . because our pml formulation ( [ pml - eq_3d ] ) requires only four auxiliary scalar variables @xmath36 inside the layer and no high order derivatives , its implementation is not only straightforward but also cheap to implement .",
    "+ in two space dimensions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and @xmath28 vanish and our pml formulation reduces to @xmath39 where @xmath40 remarkably only two auxiliary functions are needed here .",
    "+ the choice of the damping profiles @xmath41 is arbitrary ; it can be constant , linear , or quadratic among others . in our computations",
    ", we always use @xmath42 because @xmath43 is twice continuously differentiable throughout the interface at @xmath44 , no special transmission conditions are needed there .",
    "the constant @xmath45 depends on the discretization and the thickness of the layer , which in practice is truncated by a homogeneous dirichlet ( or neumann ) boundary condition .",
    "then the relative reflection , @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 in figure 1 we show damping profiles for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "[ fig : damp ]",
    "we now establish the stability and well - posedness of our pml formulation , first in two and then in three space dimensions , where we assume that the absorbing layer extends to infinity . here",
    "we follow standard stability theory for hyperbolic systems @xcite , which we briefly recall below .",

    "we introduce the new variable @xmath63 to rewrite the first equation in ( [ pml - eq_2d ] ) equivalently as @xmath64 by using ( [ ref_sys1 ] ) , we now rewrite ( [ pml - eq_2d ] ) as a first order hyperbolic system : @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath67 by using a symbolic algebra program we find that the eigenvalues of the principal part of @xmath68 for ( [ pml_sys_2d ] ) are @xmath69 thus , @xmath70 while the corresponding eigenvectors are also complete for all @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , since @xmath72 is a diagonal matrix with negative entries for @xmath71 , we conclude that ( [ pml - eq_2d ] ) is strongly stable .",
