    "the idea that the progenitors of long - duration @xmath10-ray bursts ( grbs ) are massive stars is now well - established , based in particular on the detection of associated type ic supernovae ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the nature of these supernovae , and theoretical considerations , have lead to the suggestion that the progenitors are massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite .",
    "such stars shed a considerable fraction of their mass in a fast ( @xmath11 km s@xmath4 ) wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "absorption spectroscopy of grb afterglows can in principle probe the composition and kinematics of the wind , providing in turn direct information on the nature and identity of the progenitor star .",
    "previous observations have in fact uncovered such blue - shifted absorption systems , which have been used to argue for carbon - rich ( wc ) wolf - rayet progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , potentially in binary systems @xcite .",
    "one central question to answer in applying the potentially powerful diagnostics from absorption lines is whether blue - shifted absorbers arise from outflowing circumstellar gas , or separate intervening absorbers arising from different galaxies . in addition",
    ", the intense radiation field produced by the grb can modify the circumstellar environment through ionization , excitation , and destruction of dust grains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these processes , as well as the relative abundance of low- and high - ionization ions , may in fact serve to distinguish the location of the absorbers @xcite .    here",
    "we analyze a high resolution spectrum of  in a continued effort to characterize the circumstellar and interstellar environments around grbs .",
    "this burst is of particular interest because it is one of only a few that exhibit a blue - shifted absorption system with a velocity of a @xmath12 km s@xmath4 @xcite , possibly representing the circumstellar wind from the progenitor star .",
    "however , based on the relative strengths of the low- and high - ionization lines , and the lack of detectable fine - structure transitions we conclude that the blue - shifted absorption system is not circumstellar .",
    "instead we conclude that the blue - shifted system is an intervening galaxy similar to the multiple dlas found in some quasar spectra @xcite .",
    "was detected by the hete-2 satellite on 2003 february 26.157 ut .",
    "the optical afterglow was discovered with the du pont 100-inch telescope at las campanas observatory 2.6 hr after the burst @xcite , followed by a measurement of the redshift , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the latter authors present an analysis of a low resolution spectrum obtained with the vlt , which also exhibits a second absorption system at @xmath14 .",
    "we obtained a 2700 s spectrum of the afterglow with the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ) mounted on the keck ii 10-m telescope starting 4.2 hr after the burst .",
    "the data were reduced using custom iraf routines to bias - subtract , flat - field , and rectify the ten individual echelle orders .",
    "sky subtraction was performed using the method and software described in @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using cuar and hgnexe arc lamps and air - to - vacuum and heliocentric corrections were applied .",
    "the spectrum covers the range of @xmath15   at a velocity resolution of 11.5 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the signal - to - noise over the bulk of the spectral range ( @xmath16  ) is about 40 .",
    "we obtained a second spectrum , totaling 6000 s , to search for variability in the wavelengths and equivalent widths with esi 27.4 hr after the burst .",
    "the data were reduced in the manner detailed above .",
    "the signal - to - noise of this second spectrum is about 10 .    in the first spectrum , shown in figure  [ fig : spec ] , we identify four absorption systems at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . the absorbers @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 were identified in @xcite .",
    "we identify the additional absorber @xmath24 from its lines .",
    "finally , the uncertain lines at 5494 and 5517   noted in the vlt spectrum are revealed as lines of @xmath22 here .",
    "we further compared the equivalent widths and redshifts of all lines detected in our two esi spectra to search for time - dependent effects . within the uncertainties of about @xmath25 in equivalent width and about 10 km s@xmath4 in redshift , we find no systematic changes for any of the low- and high - ionization lines .",
    "we measured the column densities of the various absorption lines using the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method @xcite : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the observed and continuum intensities , respectively .",
    "the apparent column density is given by : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the oscillator strengths and wavelengths of the absorption lines , respectively .",
    "the total apparent column density is given by @xmath32 between velocity limits @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the measured rest - frame equivalent widths and inferred column densities for each line are given in tables  [ tab : z1z2 ] and [ tab : z3z4 ] , and the final adopted columns are summarized in table  [ tab : columns ] .",
    "the absorption systems @xmath22 and @xmath23 are separated by @xmath35 km s@xmath4 and exhibit strong low - ionization lines of , , , and , as well as high - ionization lines of , , and in the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the kinematic structure of these lines is apparent in the column density profiles shown in figure  [ fig : column ] .",
    "the low - ionization lines show two and three sub - components spanning a total velocity range of about @xmath36 and @xmath37 km s@xmath4 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the absorption profiles found in previous echelle spectra of , for example , grb051111 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - ionization lines show only a single asymmetric peak , which coincides in velocity with the strongest sub - component of the low - ionization lines ( figure  [ fig : column ] ) .      our ability to measure the chemical abundances of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 absorbers is somewhat limited by line saturation and the uncertainty in the hydrogen column density .",
    "still , for the low - ionization species we are able to derive robust column densities for , as well as limits for , , and excited fine - structure states of and . compared to most previous grb absorption systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the column densities of are at least 0.5 dex lower , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : fe ] ) .",
    "based on the non - detection of @xmath40 , we find @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , indicating that saturation is not a significant problem .",
    "the limits on and are derived by applying the aod method to the appropriate velocity range around @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we find @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "multi - band afterglow observations and polarization measurements @xcite point to a low dust - to - gas ratio along the line of sight .",
    "this suggests that our values of [ zn / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] are meaningful upper limits .    to derive the metallicity of @xmath22 and @xmath23 we re - analyzed the vlt / fors2 spectrum presented in @xcite following the procedures outlined in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] . the signal - to - noise at the location of the ly@xmath54 absorption feature is low , @xmath55 per resolution element , but we find that the line profile is best fit with a pair of absorbers at the redshifts of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , each with @xmath56()@xmath57 and an uncertainty of about 0.3 dex ; a more marginal fit for a single absorber has @xmath58 and @xmath59()@xmath60 ( see inset in figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "thus , using the limit on , we find a metallicity @xmath61}\\lesssim -0.5 $ ] and @xmath62 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "assuming iron is weakly depleted as discussed above we find @xmath63}\\sim -1.5 $ ] and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "these values are at the low end of the distribution for grb - dlas @xcite .",
    "our primary interest is in understanding the nature of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 systems in light of their 2400 km s@xmath4 velocity separation .",
    "this is similar to the multiple absorption features spanning @xmath65 km s@xmath4 observed in the spectrum of grb021004 , which have been interpreted to arise in the circumstellar wind of the massive progenitor star @xcite .",
    "an alternative explanation is that @xmath22 could be an intervening system , while the absorption lines of @xmath23 arise from interstellar gas in the grb host galaxy .",
    "such multiple intervening absorption systems have been found in qso spectra @xcite .",
    "several lines of evidence suggest that the circumstellar wind scenario is an unlikely explanation .",
    "first , unlike in the case of grb021004 we do not detect an intermediate velocity ( few hundred km s@xmath4 ) absorber .",
    "such an absorber is expected to arise from the interaction of the wr wind with the red supergiant wind @xcite .",
    "still , this may not be a significant problem for the circumstellar model if the grb explosion occurred more than @xmath66 yr after the onset of the wr phase , since on this timescale the shell dissipates into the circumstellar bubble @xcite . if this was in fact the case , then it would appear that the progenitor of grb021004 exploded earlier in its evolution compared to the progenitor of",
    ".    however , a more difficult problem to overcome for the circumstellar model is the presence of strong low - ionization lines in spite of the progenitor and the burst ionizing radiation .",
    "this problem has already been noted for grb021004 , in particular the detection of outflowing hydrogen gas kinematically coincident with highly ionized gas ( , ) . from the observed brightness of the burst , @xmath67 mag at @xmath68 hr @xcite , we expect species such as ( with @xmath69 @xmath70 at @xmath71 ev ) to be ionized out to a distance of about 50 pc from the burst ( following the formulation of @xcite ) in the absence of shielding by a large column of neutral hydrogen gas . the fast wr wind is expected to span only @xmath72 pc , well within the expected radius of the strmgren sphere , @xmath73 pc @xcite , and therefore well inside of the region of @xmath74 pc in which and will be ionized in the absence of neutral hydrogen .    in the case of grb021004 ,",
    "the ratio of to was @xmath75\\approx -1.9 $ ] and @xmath76 for the zero - velocity and the @xmath77 km s@xmath4 systems , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , here we find the opposite situation , namely is over - abundant relative to , with values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "even if neutral hydrogen could survive near the progenitor star , the measured column density of @xmath80 @xmath81 (  [ sec : abund ] ) is more than four orders of magnitude larger than that of grb021004 , and requires the presence of @xmath82 m@xmath83 of hydrogen even if we limit the size of the wr wind to @xmath84 pc .",
    "there is no clear scenario that can allow for such a large mass of hydrogen within the wr wind .",
    "the inferred column density of is equally high in this context . for a mass loss rate of @xmath85 m@xmath83 yr @xmath4 and an iron mass fraction of about @xmath86",
    "@xcite the expected column density is only about @xmath87 @xmath81 if the iron is distributed uniformly over a radius of 1 pc .",
    "clumping may lead to regions of significantly higher column density , but in this case we expect only partial covering , as opposed to the observed zero transimission at the bottom of the absorption features .",
    "finally , the absence of absorption features from fine - structure and suggests that the gas is located far from the burst , in the framework of radiative pumping , and/or has a relatively low density if we consider collisional excitation .",
    "we find a limit of @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , from the non - detection of @xmath90 .",
    "this corresponds to a ratio of @xmath91 and @xmath92 for the two absorbers . in comparison ,",
    "for grb051111 the corresponding value was about @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath22 the limit on fine - structure @xmath94 is @xmath95 , somewhat lower than the detected ratio of @xmath96 in the case of grb051111 @xcite ; @xmath94 for @xmath23 is blended with the @xmath97 line of @xmath24 , preventing a useful limit on the column density .    in the context of collisional excitation ,",
    "the limit on @xmath98 , indicates a hydrogen volume density of @xmath99 @xmath100 for @xmath101 k and an electron fraction of @xmath102 @xcite . in the case of radiative pumping",
    ", the non - detection of fine - structure absorption suggests that the gas is located @xmath103 pc away from the burst @xcite , much beyond the fast wr wind .",
    "this limit is further supported by the lack of changes in line equivalent widths (  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "we note that in the case of grb021004 it has been argued that it may be possible to maintain low - ionization species ( and hydrogen ) in the circumstellar environment if the grb jet was for example structured @xcite , or as a result of shielding and mixing @xcite .",
    "however , these explanations are at best speculative for the case of grb021004 , and are unlikely to work in the more extreme case of high column density low - ionization species in .",
    "based on these various lines of reasoning , we conclude that the blue - shifted system does not arise in the progenitor wind .",
    "instead we conclude that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are multiple dlas , remarkably similar to the multiple intervening absorbers found by @xcite at a similar redshift and with a similar velocity of separation of @xmath104 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath22 absorber is similar to absorbers ctq247c observed by @xcite and dla b introduced in @xcite .",
    "both of these have a similar hydrogen column density with no detectable and lines .",
    "we find four absorption systems in the spectrum of , of which the two highest redshift systems are separated by only 2400 km s@xmath4 .",
    "absorber @xmath24 is separated by about 3400 km s@xmath4 from @xmath23 and 1100 km s@xmath4 from @xmath22 , but is detected only in . as such it most likely arises in the halo of an intervening galaxy .",
    "although @xmath22 was previously suspected to arise in the outflowing circumstellar gas surrounding the progenitor star @xcite , we conclude that this scenario is unlikely based on the presence of high column density low - ionization species , the lack of excited fine - structure lines , the large column density of iron , and the possible presence of large column density of neutral hydrogen .",
    "a more likely scenario is that system @xmath22 is an intervening absorber .",
    "this conclusion leaves only grbs 021004 and 050505 as showing potential evidence for wind outflows from the progenitor star . in the former case ,",
    "the presence of high velocity neutral hydrogen , as well as and , presents a challenge in the context of wr wind models and the ionizing radiation of the burst @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "only high - ionization is detected in outflow @xcite , removing the problem of explaining the presence of low - ionization lines , but the low resolution of the spectrum prevents a detailed study . given the influence of the kinematic and ionization structure of the wind in the pre - explosion environment , as well as the effects of the grb radiation field itself , it is of prime importance to make model predictions for the type and column density of various ionic species that can be observed in the afterglow spectrum .",
    "such models can be used to assess whether any of the outflowing systems observed to date are in fact signatures of the stellar wind .    assessing @xmath22 as an intervening absorber",
    ", we note that both @xmath22 and the host galaxy absorber @xmath23 exhibit similar abundances and kinematics compared to previous grb - dlas and multiple dlas found in qso sight lines . assuming that iron is weakly depleted ( as suggested by several lines of evidence , see  [ sec : abund ] ) the gas metallicity is somewhat lower than in most previous grb - dlas",
    ", @xmath105}\\sim -1.5 $ ] and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath22 most likely represents an intervening galaxy , we may be able to identify it in deep imaging around the grb position , and spectroscopy of possible intervening galaxies in the field .",
    "previous narrow - band imaging observations aimed at finding ly@xmath54 emission in the range @xmath106 , have uncovered three galaxies that may have similar redshifts to the @xmath24 and @xmath22 absorbers @xcite .",
    "no source was detected at the grb position .",
    "these putative counterparts are faint and it is reasonable to interpret both the undetected grb host galaxy and the intervening systems as low mass galaxies with low metallicity and dust content .    the remaining open question is whether there is a link between the grb host absorber and the intervening systems .",
    "it has recently been shown that the probability of finding multiple intervening absorbers toward grbs is larger compared to qso sight lines @xcite .",
    "however , the majority of these systems are separated by @xmath107 km s@xmath4 and are unlikely to be physically connected . with a velocity separation of 2400 km",
    "s@xmath4 it is conceivable that @xmath22 and the grb host are part of the same large - scale structure , as has been suggested for the multiple dlas in qso sight lines @xcite .",
    "future observations of the environment of , as well as similar absorption systems may shed light on the dependence of the number and velocity difference of intervening systems on the properties of grb host galaxies and their large - scale environments .",
