    "with the recent developments of the atmospheric and accelerator based neutrino experiments it is now well known that neutrinos oscillate and have finite masses .",
    "now , the main goal is to precisely determine the different parameters of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix , absolute neutrino masses , cp violating phase @xmath3 , etc .",
    "the neutrino energy region of a few gev is quite sensitive to the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "therefore , most of the present experiments like miniboone , k2k , t2k , no@xmath4a , etc . have taken data or have been planned in this energy region .",
    "neutrino detection proceeds basically through various channels of interaction with hadronic targets like quasielastic scattering , meson production , resonance excitations , etc ... therefore , a reliable estimate of these cross sections has become important .",
    "there is a considerable ongoing theoretical and experimental effort addressing this question ( see e.g. the proceedings of the nuint conference series  @xcite ) with many of the studies concentrated at low energies where quasielastic scattering and pion production dominate or in the deep inelastic scattering .",
    "however , in the discussed energy region , other not so well known processes like kaon and hyperon production may also become important . in principle , their cross sections are smaller than for the pionic processes because of phase space and the cabibbo suppression for @xmath5 reactions .",
    "nonetheless , in the coming years of precision neutrino physics , their knowledge could be relevant for the data analysis , apart from their own intrinsic interest related to the role played by the strange quarks in hadronic physics .",
    "the currently available data is restricted to a few events measured in bubble chamber experiments  @xcite . however",
    ", this is expected to change soon . in particular , miner@xmath6a ,",
    "a dedicated experiment to measure neutrino nucleus cross section using several nuclear targets like carbon , iron and lead in the neutrino energy region of 1 - 20 gev has recently started taking data .",
    "it is also planned to study specifically the strange particle production and it is expected that thousands of events would be accumulated where a kaon is produced in the final state  @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    "there are very few calculations which deal with strange particle production at low neutrino energies : single hyperon production  @xcite , the study of several kaon and hyperon production channels of dewan  @xcite and the work of shrock  @xcite who has analysed the @xmath7 processes . at higher energies ,",
    "amer has studied the strange particle production assuming the dominance of s - channel resonant mechanisms  @xcite . also , in part as a consequence of the scarcity of theoretical work , the montecarlo generators used in the analysis of the experiments apply models that are not too well suited to describe the strangeness production at low energies . for instance , neut , used by super - kamiokande , k2k , sciboone and t2k , only considers associated kaon production implemented by a model based on the excitation and later decay of resonances  @xcite .",
    "a similar model is used by other event generators like neugen  @xcite , nuance  @xcite ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and genie  @xcite . as it will be emphasized below",
    ", this approach is not appropriate for low energies strangeness production .    in neutrino induced reactions , the first inelastic reaction creating strange quarks is the single kaon production ( without accompanying hyperons ) reactions is much lower and corresponds to hyperon production . ] .",
    "this charged current ( cc ) @xmath5 process is particularly appealing for several reasons .",
    "one of them is the important background that could produce , due to atmospheric neutrino interactions , in the analysis of one of the main decay channels the proton has in many susy gut models ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "a second reason is its simplicity from a theoretical point of view . at low energies ,",
    "it is possible to obtain model independent predictions using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath9pt ) and due to the absence of @xmath10 baryonic resonances , the range of validity of the calculation could be extended to higher energies than for other channels .",
    "furthermore , the kaon associated production ( with accompanying hyperons ) has a higher energy threshold ( 1.10 vs. 0.79 gev ) .",
    "this implies that even when the associated production is not cabibbo suppressed , for a wide energy region ( such as the anl , the miniboone or the t2k neutrino spectrum ) single kaon production could still be dominant  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : form ] we present the formalism for cc single kaon production in neutrino nucleon scattering based on the lagrangians of su(3 ) @xmath9pt .",

    "there are not s - channel contributions given the absence of @xmath10 baryonic resonances .",
    "the current of the kp term is proportional to @xmath33 .",

    "[ eq : lagm ] , that incorporates the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry coming from the quark masses  @xcite , is not relevant for our study .    the lowest - order chiral lagrangian for the baryon octet in the presence of an external current can be written in terms of the su(3 ) matrix @xmath50 as @xmath51 -\\frac{d}{2}\\mbox{tr}\\left(\\bar{b}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma_5\\{u_\\mu , b\\}\\right ) -\\frac{f}{2}\\mbox{tr}\\left(\\bar{b}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma_5[u_\\mu , b]\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the mass of the baryon octet , and the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be determined from the baryon semileptonic decays  @xcite .",

    "the value of the various parameters of the formulas are shown in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "for the 22.5 ktons of a water target and a period of 1489 days as in the superk analysis  @xcite of proton decay . as in the quoted paper",
    ", we include cuts in the electron momentum ( @xmath70 mev ) and muon momentum ( @xmath71 mev ) .",
    "we find that single kaon production is a very small source of background . in the superk analysis",
    "the kaon production was modeled following ref .",
    "@xcite and only included associated kaon production . although some of the cuts applied in their analysis , such as looking for an accompanying hyperon , are useless for our case , we find that this source of background is negligible , given the smallness of our results and the totally different energy distribution of kaons and final leptons in the production and decay reactions",
    ".    finally , we study the values of @xmath72 involved in the reaction for the typical neutrino energies we have considered . if high values of this magnitude are relevant , the results would be sensitive to higher orders of the chiral lagrangians and/or a more precise description of the form factors .",
    "we show the @xmath72 distribution in fig .",
    "( [ fg : dsdq2 ] ) for the three studied channels at a neutrino energy e@xmath73 gev .",
    "the reactions are always forward peaked ( for the final lepton ) , even in the absence of any form factor ( @xmath74 ) , favouring relatively small values of the momentum transfer .      in this figure",
    ", we also show the dependence of the cross section on the mass of the final lepton that reduces the cross section at low @xmath72 values .",
    "the process @xmath76 shows a slightly different behavior that reflects an important ( and @xmath72 dependent ) interference between the pion exchange and the contact terms .",
    "till now we have discussed the kaon production off free nucleons . however ,",
    "most of the experiments are carried out on detectors containing complex nuclei such as iron , oxygen or carbon . on the other hand ,",
    "nuclear effects are known to be quite large for pion production induced by neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this question is much simpler for the kaons .",
    "first , because there is no kaon absorption and the final state interaction is reduced to a repulsive potential , small when compared with the typical kaon energies .",
    "second , because of the absence of resonant channels in the production processes . we could remember here that some of the major nuclear effects for pion production are originated by the modification of the @xmath77 properties on nuclei .",
    "other nuclear effects , such as fermi motion and pauli blocking will only produce minor changes on the cross section and can easily be implemented in the monte carlo codes .    in summary",
    ", we have developed a microscopical model for single kaon production off nucleons induced by neutrinos based on the su(3 ) chiral lagrangians .",
    "this model should be quite reliable at low and intermediate energies given the absence of @xmath10 baryonic resonances in the s - channel .",
    "the parameters of the model are well known : @xmath0 , the pion decay constant , cabibbo s angle , the proton and neutron magnetic moments and the axial vector coupling constants for the baryons octet , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the latter ones",
    ", we have taken the values obtained from the analysis of the hyperon semileptonic decays .",
    "the importance of higher order terms has been estimated using a dipole form factor with a mass around 1gev and exploring the dependence of our results on this parameter .",
    "we obtain cross sections that are around two orders of magnitude smaller than for pion production for neutrino spectra such as those of anl or miniboone .",
    "this can be understood because of the cabibbo suppression and of the smaller phase space .",
    "nonetheless , the cross sections are large enough to be measured , for instance , with the expected minerva and t2k fluxes and could have been well measured at miniboone .",
    "we have also found , that due to the higher threshold of the associated kaon production , the reactions we have studied are the dominant source of kaons for a wide range of energies , and thus their study is important for some low energy experiments and for the atmospheric neutrino flux .",
