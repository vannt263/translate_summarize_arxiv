    "the fourier transform of the gpds w.r.t transverse momentum transfer has not only been used to study the nucleon structure in transverse impact parameter space @xcite but it also gives a tomographic picture of the distribution of quark charge densities inside the nucleon through the impact parameter dependent parton distribution function ( ipdpdf ) @xmath3 for a quark of momentum fraction @xmath0 located at a transverse position @xmath4 .",

    "the role of transverse momentum of parton has been significant to understand the nucleon structure as it yields information on the fragmentation functions and the single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) @xcite .",
    "some efforts have been made to understand this phenomena by taking one gluon exchange in the final state interactions when the distribution functions depend on the longitudinal as well as transverse momenta of the partons @xcite .",
    "transverse charge density defines a way to analyze electromagnetic form factors of hadrons moving at infinite momentum with transverse distance @xmath4 from the transverse center of momentum @xcite .",
    "charge densities have been discussed in impact parameter space for the polarized and transversely polarized nucleons @xcite , in finite radius approximation @xcite , in scalar diquark model using transverse coordinate space @xcite as well as using sachs form factors @xcite .",

    "this model has been used to calculate the spin and orbital angular momentum of a composite relativistic system as well as the gpds in impact parameter space and it also gives the schwinger anomalous magnetic moment and the corresponding dirac s and pauli form factor including the vanishing of the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment .",
    "the purpose of the present communication is to determine the distribution of nucleon charge density in transverse coordinate space and in impact parameter space using light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) of simple spin-@xmath9 objects like dressed quark or a dressed electron in theory .",

    "<S> electromagnetic form factors obtained from the overlap of light front wave functions ( lfwfs ) have been used to study the transverse densities of charge and magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations have been carried out to develop a relation between the charge distribution of the quarks inside nucleon in the transverse coordinate space as well as in the impact parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> when a comparison is carried out , it is found that the transverse distribution in the impact parameter space , where the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 can be fixed , falls off faster than the spatial distribution in the transverse coordinate space where there is some contribution from the longitudinal momentum as well . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous magnetization density of the nucleon has also been discussed . </S>",
    "<S> further , we have also presented the results of the qcd transverse ads charge density inspired from the holographic qcd model . </S>"
