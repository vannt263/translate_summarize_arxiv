    "nucleus - nucleus collisions at relativistic energies have been intensely studied over the last two decades .",

    "these , in turn , may reveal information on the properties of the equation of state near the qcd phase boundary @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this work is to study how the multiplicity fluctuations change with the varying number of nucleons participating in the collision , with centrality and system size .",
    "first results on the centrality dependence in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0  gev published by the wa98 collaboration  @xcite indicated that the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution near midrapidity increases towards peripheral collisions .",
    "our analysis extends such measurements to c and si nuclei and carefully addresses the contribution from fluctuations of the number of participants which can dominate the fluctuations of extensive quantities such as the produced particle multiplicity .",
    "furthermore an extensive comparison of the results to available models is performed .",
    "the data sample consists of centrality tagged minimum bias pb+pb , semi - central c+c and si+si as well as minimum bias p+p collisions registered by the na49 detector at the cern sps .",
    "the multiplicity fluctuations were studied in the forward rapidity region ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the collision centrality was characterized by the number of projectile participants derived from the projectile spectator energy measured in a forward calorimeter .",

    "a prominent example is the wounded nucleon model @xcite , in which the sources are wounded nucleons , i.e. the nucleons that have interacted at least once . in this model",
