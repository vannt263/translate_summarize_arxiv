    "various ways exist in which such a background might be generated , including cosmological inflation , collision of bubbles during a phase transition , and motions of topological defects .",
    "we will be concentrating on the first of these .",
    "there are currently four large - scale ground - based interferometers under construction , namely ligo , virgo , geo and tama , and a proposal for a space - based detector lisa is also under consideration ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for reviews of these experiments . unlike measures of density perturbations , these experiments probe frequencies which are high enough that the gravitational waves have had a wavelength less than the hubble radius since very early in the history of the universe .",
    "assuming the standard cosmology , where the universe was radiation dominated from an early stage , giving way to matter domination relatively recently , the time when a comoving frequency @xmath2 equalled the hubble scale is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 hz is the mode that is just re - entering the hubble radius today , @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath6 the redshift of matter  radiation equality . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the density parameter and hubble constant in the usual units .",
    "comoving units have been normalized to match present physical units . since @xmath9 , we have @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the typical frequency band probed by ground - based interferometers .",
    "the epoch when the universe had a temperature higher than a gev is long before any time at which we have reliable observations constraining the cosmological evolution . because interesting wavelengths have been less than the hubble radius since then , the amplitude of the stochastic background will be sensitive to whatever the actual cosmological evolution is .",
    "a different cosmological model will have two principal effects : first , it will modify the relationship between scales given by eq .",
    "( [ fs2 ] ) for the standard cosmology , and secondly it can alter the amplitude . only those scales which are larger than the hubble radius will have their amplitude unchanged in alternative cosmologies .    to highlight this effect",
    ", we shall consider two alternative scenarios to the standard cosmology .",
    "in the first we assume a second short burst of inflation at a lower energy scale than standard inflation , often called thermal inflation  @xcite .",
    "such a short stage of inflation may be desirable to get rid of unwanted relic particles which could otherwise have dramatic consequences on the subsequent evolution of the universe  @xcite .",
    "this second burst of inflation has in general no connection to the usual inflationary epoch which is assumed responsible for the generation of the density perturbations and gravitational waves leading to structure formation and microwave anisotropies .",
    "it is normally imagined to begin at a temperature around @xmath12 , and continue until about @xmath13 ( the supersymmetry scale ) , giving a total of @xmath14 @xmath15-foldings of inflation . if this second burst of inflation occurs after the scales of interest ( i.e. the scales accessible to ligo and lisa ) are within the horizon , then the stochastic background is altered .",
    "the second alternative is the recently discussed possibility that the universe becomes temporarily dominated by some long - lived massive particle ( for example the moduli fields of string theory ) , inducing an early period of matter domination which ends when the particle finally decays to restore the usual radiation - dominated universe ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another possible origin for a short period of early matter domination lies with the qcd phase transition , as was recently discussed by schwarz  @xcite .    to make the discussion concrete",
    ", we require a model for the initial gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "we consider two somewhat different models for the actual origin of the stochastic background .",
    "the first is conventional inflation , which is the standard case but which gives a disappointingly low signal even in the standard cosmology .",
    "the second is an unusual variant on inflation known as the pre big bang ( pbb ) scenario  @xcite .",
    "this is a much more speculative idea , but potentially of greater interest as it predicts a spectrum which rises sharply towards small scales @xcite , the opposite of the usual inflationary behaviour , thus creating a realistic prospect of direct detection of the gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "the first modification to the standard big bang model we consider is a second epoch of inflation occurring after the beginning of the radiation epoch .",
    "we assume that the original epoch of inflation ( either conventional or pre big bang ) responsible for generating the gravitational wave background ends at conformal time @xmath16 ( from now on we will always use conformal time ) , at which point the radiation era begins . at time @xmath17 a second era of inflation starts which ends at @xmath18 ; we will model this era as exponential inflation .",
    "after @xmath18 the universe again becomes radiation dominated and the evolution of the universe continues according the standard model with an era of matter domination starting at @xmath19 which lasts up to the present .",
    "the scale factor after the original period of inflation is given by @xmath20        { \\displaystyle a_3 \\left ( \\tau_3 - \\tau \\right)^{-1 } } \\ , ; &           \\tau_{{\\rm i}2 } < \\tau < \\tau_{{\\rm r}2 } \\\\[4 mm ]        { \\displaystyle a_4 \\tau } \\ , ;         &   \\tau_{{\\rm r}2 } < \\tau < \\tau_{{\\rm eq } } \\\\[4 mm ]        { \\displaystyle a_5 \\left(\\tau_5 + \\tau \\right)^2 } \\ , ; &          \\tau > \\tau_{{\\rm eq } }      \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where the constants are determined by requiring the continuity of @xmath21 and @xmath22 at the transition between two epochs .",
    "for the moment we only want to make an approximate estimate of the modifications introduced in the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background and we will not worry about the exact value of these constants .",
    "we parametrize the thermal inflation by the energy scale at which it starts , @xmath23 , and by the total expansion it gives rise to , @xmath24 .    in this model",
    "we assume that the first epoch of radiation domination happens at a temperature of order @xmath25 gev , while the short period of thermal inflation begins around @xmath26 gev .",
    "we also assume that during thermal inflation the universe expands by a factor of @xmath27 ( approximately @xmath28 @xmath15-foldings of inflation ) .",
    "this is the minimal amount of inflation which solves the moduli problem  @xcite .    normalizing the scale factor at the present as @xmath29 , we can write all the relevant parameters in our model in terms of @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( the hubble parameters at the end of the first period of inflation and at beginning of the second stage of inflation ) , @xmath32 , the present hubble parameter @xmath33 and the redshift at the matter  radiation equality @xmath34 . in terms of these parameters",

    "the technical details of the calculation are quite complex , and we describe them fully in the appendix ; here in the main text we will restrict ourselves to describing the relevant physics and exhibiting the results",
    ".    on short and long scales things are relatively simple .",
    "modes always above the horizon can not change their amplitude , but there is an apparent effect caused by the change in the correspondence between comoving scales ( i.e.  physical scales during inflation ) and present physical scales ; the extra expansion during thermal inflation shifts the spectrum to long wavelengths . for a flat spectrum",
    "this has no effect , but if the spectrum is tilted this alters the amplitude on a given present physical scale .",
    "this effect may have observational consequences in the contribution of tensor perturbations to the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation as we will discuss in the following subsection .",
    "a related effect is a redshift in the high - frequency cutoff of the spectrum corresponding to the horizon size at the end of the main period of inflation . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfc ] ) we obtain @xmath39    very short scale modes , which are always inside the horizon when the alternate behaviour is occurring , simply suffer an additional redshift .",
    "modes inside the horizon behave as radiation , with the energy density decreasing as @xmath40 .",
    "if thermal inflation occurs it means there is more total expansion between the initial generation of the modes and the present , and so their amplitude is suppressed .",
    "for example , with perfect exponential thermal inflation , this suppression will be @xmath41 .",
    "had we assumed an epoch of power - law thermal inflation with @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 would be redshifted by @xmath45 . recalling that during an epoch of thermal inflation the total energy density redshifts as @xmath46 , the suppression in @xmath47 in this case would be by a factor @xmath48 .",
    "the most interesting regime is the intermediate one . for waves with frequencies in the interval @xmath49",
    ", a curious phenomenon happens : these waves enter the hubble radius during the first epoch of radiation but are again pushed outside the horizon during the subsequent epoch of inflation . while they are inside the horizon their behaviour is oscillatory .",
    "hence , when they leave the horizon , their phases will have a strong dependence on frequency and this will leave an oscillatory imprint in the spectrum . this is strongly reminiscent of the acoustic peak structure in the density perturbation spectrum which leads to oscillations in the radiation power spectrum , and is arising similarly from the dominance of growing mode perturbations at horizon entry .",
    "similar oscillations have also been found in the primordial density perturbation spectrum in the case of double inflation  @xcite .    to make our discussion concrete",
    ", we now exhibit results for two particular models for the initial spectrum .",
    "we model conventional inflation as a period of power - law inflation  @xcite , corresponding to an initial epoch where the scale factor behaves as @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( equality holds for exponential inflation ) .",

    "the contribution for the anisotropies coming from scalar perturbations will also be suppressed , but if the initial spectra have a different tilt there will be a net effect in the tensor to scalar ratio .    one can view the effect of thermal inflation as being a ` transfer function ' which processes the initial spectrum into a final spectrum .",
