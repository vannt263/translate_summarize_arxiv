    "modern lattice qcd simulations are mostly based on direct evaluation of the path integral of the theory . such approach , while being very general and efficient for many applications , suffers from a number of problems , most notable of which are the sign problem at finite chemical potential , critical slowing down at small quark masses and large finite - volume effects as well as small signal - to - noise ratio in the analysis of excited states .",
    "these problems are inherent to standard monte - carlo simulations and can not be efficiently solved by simply increasing the computation power , since the required computing time quickly increases ( in the worst cases , exponentially ) with the required precision . such situation makes it tempting to devise alternative simulation algorithms for non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "one of the efficient alternative numerical methods is the so - called diagrammatic monte - carlo , a method based on stochastic summation of all the terms in the strong- or weak - coupling expansion of the observable of interest @xcite .",
    "such a method in some cases allows one to reduce or avoid completely the sign problem in the original path integral , and does not suffer from finite - volume effects .",
    "furthermore , one can construct algorithms which yield particular correlation functions in terms of probability distributions of some random variables , which greatly facilitates the analysis of excited states @xcite .",
    "this is the idea of the `` worm '' algorithm by prokofev and svistunov @xcite , in which the probability distribution of the positions @xmath2 , @xmath3 of `` head '' and the `` tail '' of the worm yields the two - point green function @xmath4 .",
    "diagrammatic monte - carlo and the `` worm '' algorithm have been successfully applied to a number of statistical models with discrete symmetry groups such as the ising model , the xy model and unitary fermi gas and showed practically no critical slowing down near quantum phase transitions",
    ".    however , application of such methods to lattice field theories with continuous field variables ( such as two - dimensional @xmath1 and @xmath5 sigma - models , abelian gauge theories and the @xmath6 theory ) resulted so far in quite complicated and model - dependent algorithms @xcite . a generalization of such algorithms to @xmath7 sigma - models or to non - abelian gauge theories is still not found .",
    "these algorithms are in essence based on the strong - coupling expansion , and while their applicability is not limited by the strong - coupling regime , one can expect that algorithms based on the weak - coupling expansion might show better performance near the continuum limit .",
    "typically , the weak - coupling expansion in such lattice theories is either quite complicated or non - convergent . up to now",
    ", divergent behavior of the weak - coupling perturbative expansions strongly limits the applicability of diagrammatic monte - carlo to field theories with continuous field variables . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite a method was proposed to construct convergent series which approximate the non - analytic path integrals with desired precision .",
    "this method , however , is difficult to generalize to physically interesting field theories such as non - abelian lattice gauge theories .",
    "another way to obtain convergent series while preserving important physical properties of the theory is to sum over diagrams with certain topology only .",
    "this corresponds to the large-@xmath0 limit in quantum field theories and matrix models , that is , the limit of infinite dimensionality of an internal symmetry group , such as @xmath1 or @xmath7 . for such theories ,",
    "each feynman diagram acquires a factor @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the euler character of this diagram @xcite . in the limit @xmath10 , the contribution of planar diagrams with @xmath11 dominates , and the sum over all planar diagrams typically has a finite convergence radius @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a stochastic method for summing over all planar diagrams in large-@xmath0 quantum field theories .",
    "the method is based on stochastic solution of schwinger - dyson equations , so that the correlators of field variables are obtained as stationary probability distributions of certain random variables . in this way",
    "we implement the idea of importance sampling , so that numerically small observables correspond to unlikely events .",
    "these probability distributions are sampled by the so - called nonlinear random processes .",
    "in contrast to conventional markov chains , stationary probability distributions of such random processes satisfy nonlinear equations , and hence they can be called `` nonlinear random processes '' or `` nonlinear markov chains '' in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "factorization of single - trace operators in the large-@xmath0 limit of quantum field theories corresponds to the phenomena of `` chaos propagation '' in random processes @xcite .    while in the diagrammatic monte - carlo and in the `` worm '' algorithm the diagrams",
    "are stored in computer memory as a whole and are updated in such a way that the detailed balance condition is satisfied at each step , the method described in this paper works only with external lines .",
    "in contrast to the standard metropolis algorithm , one should not know explicitly the weight of each diagram , and the transition probabilities do not satisfy any detailed balance condition . unlike the quite popular `` numerical functional methods '' in continuum gauge theories ( see @xcite for a review ) , the proposed method does not require any truncation of the hierarchy of schwinger - dyson equations , and work only with singlet operators w.r.t .",
    "the internal symmetry group .",
    "another distinct feature is that the computational complexity of the method does not depend on @xmath0 , while the standard monte - carlo , the functional methods and the `` worm '' algorithm all require infinite computational resources in the limit @xmath10 .",
    "this feature might be advantageous for numerical checks of the predictions of the holographic models which are dual to large-@xmath0 quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : sdeq_general ] we analyze the general structure of schwinger - dyson equations in large-@xmath0 quantum field theories on the example of a scalar matrix - valued field theory .",
    "when large-@xmath0 factorization is taken into account , schwinger - dyson equations become nonlinear equations with infinitely many unknowns . in section [ sec : recursive_process ] we describe nonlinear random processes of recursive type @xcite which can be used to stochastically solve such equations . in section",
    "[ sec : sds_stochastic_solution ] we apply such random processes to solve schwinger - dyson equations in several large-@xmath0 theories . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : phi4_general ] we consider the scalar matrix - valued field theory , for which the perturbative expansion yields the conventional feynman diagrams in momentum space . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : matrix_model ] this solution is compared with the exact solution of the simplest quantum field theory in zero dimensions , that is , the hermitian matrix model @xcite .",
    "the convergence of such solution and the strength of the sign problem is discussed . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : weingarten ] we consider the weingarten model @xcite and demonstrate how the proposed method can be used to simulate random surfaces on the hypercubic lattice . in this case , our method reproduces an ensemble of open , rather than closed , random surfaces , with critical behavior which is quite different from those of the closed planar random surfaces .",
    "since the structure of schwinger - dyson equations in the weingarten model is similar to the loop equations in large-@xmath0 non - abelian lattice gauge theories @xcite , studying this model might be helpful for further extensions of the present approach to non - abelian gauge theories .    while the method described in section [ sec : recursive_process ] works well for non - compact field variables , for field theories with compact field variables , such as nonlinear sigma - models or non - abelian lattice gauge theories ,",
    "a straightforward stochastic interpretation of schwinger - dyson equations is only possible in the strong coupling limit . in the weak - coupling limit one",
    "expects the field correlators to contain both the perturbative part in the coupling constant @xmath12 as well as nonperturbative corrections of the form @xmath13 with some constant @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath12 typically results in asymptotic series , and nonperturbative corrections appear as a result of resummation of such series @xcite .    in section",
    "[ sec : rps_with_mem ] we show how such nonperturbative corrections can be taken into account by a further relaxation of the markov property of the random process .",
    "the basic idea is to absorb the divergent part of the series into a self - consistent redefinition of the expansion parameter .",
    "these redefined parameters play the role of nonperturbative `` condensates '' @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the redefined expansion parameters can be estimated with increasing precision from the previous history of the random process which solves the schwinger - dyson equations , thus leading to the emergence of the `` memory '' of the random process .",
    "the approach of the redefined parameters to their self - consistent values is reminiscent somehow of the renormalization - group flow @xcite .",
    "such dependence on the previous history makes the random process essentially non - markovian , so that the stationary probability distribution also satisfies some nonlinear equation .",
    "we illustrate this idea on the example of @xmath1 sigma - model in two dimensions , which is equivalent to a bosonic random walk with a self - consistent mass .",
    "random process which simulates this model has the `` memory '' but no `` recursive '' structure .",
    "presumably , in order to sum up both perturbative and non - perturbative corrections which arise in non - abelian lattice gauge theories or @xmath15 sigma - models , one should devise the `` recursive '' nonlinear random process ( which would sum up perturbative corrections ) with memory ( which would generate nonperturbative quantities in a renormalization - group - like way ) .",
    "finally , in the concluding section we summarize the present work and discuss its extension to non - abelian lattice gauge theories in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "in order to analyze the general structure of schwinger - dyson equations for large-@xmath0 quantum field theories , let us first consider the theory of a hermitian @xmath16 matrix - valued field @xmath17 with the following lagrangian : @xmath18 } = n { { \\rm tr } \\ , } \\phi { \\left ( x \\right ) } \\ , { \\left ( m^2 - \\delta \\right ) } \\ , \\phi { \\left ( x \\right ) } + \\frac{n \\lambda}{4 } { { \\rm tr } \\ , } \\phi^{4 } { \\left ( x \\right ) }   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this theory is most convenient to illustrate the method described in this paper , since its perturbative expansion leads to conventional feynman diagrams in the momentum space .",
    "since this theory should be somehow regularized , let us assume from the very beginning that the action ( [ phi4_field_action ] ) is defined on the euclidean hypercubic @xmath19-dimensional lattice with total volume @xmath20 in lattice units .",
    "thus , the coordinates @xmath2 take integer values and @xmath21 is the lattice laplacian ( for definiteness , with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "schwinger - dyson equations for a theory with the action ( [ phi4_field_action ] ) read @xcite :    @xmath22    where the single - trace correlators are @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the laplacian acting on @xmath25 and we have already taken into account the factorization property in the limit @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath26 these equations hold for any argument of the correlators , but the resulting system is redundant , and it is sufficient to consider only those schwinger - dyson equations which were obtained by the variation of the fields at @xmath25 .",
    "it is convenient now to go to the momentum representation , introducing the green functions in momentum space @xmath27 . in order to keep all expressions as symmetric as possible , we do not separate the factor @xmath28 in @xmath29 explicitly .",
    "this condition will be automatically satisfied by the nonlinear random process which we describe in subsection [ subsec : phi4_general ] .",
    "the equations ( [ phi4_sds_original_n2 ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_original ] ) in the momentum representation are : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the free scalar propagator on the hypercubic lattice .",
    "all momenta are assumed to lie in the first brillouin zone @xmath32 and are added modulo @xmath33 .",
    "the structure of these equations is schematically illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : phi4_sds_general ] , where dashed blobs denote the green functions @xmath29 and empty blobs denote @xmath34 .    ) .",
    "dashed blobs denote the green functions @xmath29 and empty blobs denote the free propagator @xmath34.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    thus we have obtained an infinite system of quadratic functional equations for the set of functions @xmath29 with @xmath35 .",
    "such structure is common for large-@xmath0 quantum field theories : schwinger - dyson equations are quadratic equations for infinite set of unknown variables . in the case of scalar matrix field theory considered here ,",
    "the unknown variables are the functions of the sequences of momenta @xmath36 for any even @xmath37 . in the case of lattice gauge theories or string theories",
    "schwinger - dyson equations are most naturally formulated in terms of the wilson loops , which are the functions defined on the discrete space of closed loops on the lattice @xcite . in this case , the equations are also quadratic w.r.t .",
    "the wilson loops .",
    "for @xmath1 sigma - model , schwinger - dyson equations are also quadratic equations which involve only the two - point function ( see section [ sec : rps_with_mem ] ) .",
    "typically , systems of equations with infinitely many unknowns can be efficiently solved by stochastic methods .",
    "it is advantageous to estimate the value of each unknown variable as a probability of observing some state of a random process . in this case",
    "the unknowns with numerically small values correspond to unlikely events , and the set of infinitely many unknown variables is automatically truncated to a set of unknowns with sufficiently large values .",
    "such methods are well - known mainly in the context of kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "recently they were also discussed in the context of probabilistic programming @xcite . in the next section",
    "we describe a discrete - time , discrete - space method of such type which is in our opinion most suitable for solving the schwinger - dyson equations in the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we consider nonlinear equations of the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the elements of some space @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 denotes summation or integration over all the elements of this space .",
    "we also assume that the functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 satisfy the inequalities @xmath47 for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "we would like to find a stochastic process for which @xmath48 is proportional to the probability of the occurrence of the element @xmath2 in some configuration space .",
    "obviously , ordinary markov process with configuration space @xmath41 can not solve such a problem , since stationary distributions of markov processes obey linear equations . in order to solve the nonlinear equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) , one can ,",
    "for example , extend somehow the configuration space .",
    "extensions of markov processes with stationary probability distributions which obey nonlinear equations have been considered recently in @xcite . in this section",
    "we concentrate on random processes similar to recursive markov chains of @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that at any time one can leave the current chain and start a new one , then returning back to the old chain at some time .",
    "the initial state of a newly created chain depends on the states of older chains .",
    "thus one has not a single markov chain , but rather an infinite stack of chains .",
    "the random process which we describe below will be similar to these recursive markov chains , but instead of referring to `` recursion '' we will explicitly introduce the underlying stack structure .",
    "here we first consider the equations ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with the coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 being all positive , and in appendix [ sec : arbitrary_coefficients ] we generalize to coefficients with arbitrary signs or complex phases .",
    "consider an extended configuration space which consists of ordered sequences @xmath49 for arbitrary @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "it is illustrative to interpret such configuration space as a stack of elements of the space @xmath41 , so that @xmath52 is at the top of the stack .",
    "the desired random process can be specified by the following prescriptions . at each discrete time step",
    "do one of the following :    create : : :    with probability @xmath44 create new    element @xmath43 and push it to the stack .",
    "evolve : : :    with probability @xmath53 pop the    element @xmath3 from the stack and push the element    @xmath2 to the stack .",
    "join : : :    with probability @xmath46    consecutively pop two elements @xmath39 , @xmath40    from the stack and push a single element @xmath2 to the stack .",
    "restart : : :    with probability    @xmath54 ,    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the two topmost    elements in the stack , empty the stack and push a single element    @xmath43 into it , with probability distribution    proportional to @xmath44 .",
    "the last action is also the procedure used to initialize the random process .",
    "the `` evolve '' action is just the evolution of a single markov chain at the top of the stack , with transition probabilities proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "the condition ( [ probability_ineq ] ) and the positivity requirement ensures that @xmath44 , @xmath53 and @xmath46 can be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "consider now an equation for the stationary probability distribution of such a markov chain .",
    "it has a general form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a stationary probability of the occurrence of a state @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the transition probability between the states @xmath59 and @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the stationary probability to find the elements @xmath61 in the stack .",
    "this probability distribution function is obviously normalized to unity : @xmath62 the equation for the stationary probability distribution in our case reads : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . by a direct substitution",
    "one can check that there is a factorized solution for @xmath60 : @xmath66 where @xmath48 obeys exactly the equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) and @xmath67 obeys the following inhomogeneous linear equation : @xmath68    thus , for any equation of the form ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with positive coefficients which satisfy ( [ probability_ineq ] ) , there is a random process whose stationary distribution encodes the solution of this equation as in ( [ random_process_factorized_pd ] ) .",
    "the factorization of the stationary probability distribution of random processes with such an infinite configuration space is known as the `` propagation of chaos '' in random processes and was discovered for classical kinetic equations by mckean , vlasov and kac @xcite . comparing the equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sds_original_n2 ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_original ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sds_momentum ] ) , we conclude that this property corresponds to the factorization of single - trace operators in large-@xmath0 quantum field theories .",
    "it is interesting that time reversal of the random process described above leads to the so - called branching random process @xcite , which has quite different properties .",
    "this is due to the fact that for such random processes there is no detailed balance condition , and hence no time reversal symmetry .",
    "we do not consider here a subtle mathematical question of the existence of solutions to equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) , since in our case it is ensured by the physical applications of this equation .",
    "finally , let us describe a practical procedure for finding @xmath48 by simulating the random process described above . by standard statistical methods",
    ", one should sample the probability distribution @xmath69 of the topmost element in the stack ( provided there is more than one element in it , otherwise we estimate @xmath67 rather than @xmath48 , see ( [ random_process_factorized_pd ] ) ) . from ( [ random_process_factorized_pd ] ) , we get @xmath70 , with @xmath71 . it should be stressed that @xmath48 is not normalized to unity , but rather satisfies the inequality @xmath72 . the value of the normalization constant @xmath73 can be also easily found numerically , since the probability to find @xmath74 elements in the stack decreases as @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "after presenting the general method in section [ sec : recursive_process ] , we are ready to describe a stochastic numerical solution of schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_n2 ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_momentum ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the coupling constant @xmath77 in ( [ phi4_field_action ] ) is negative .",
    "this allows us to apply directly the results of section [ sec : recursive_process ] , where all the coefficients in ( [ random_process_eq ] ) are assumed to be positive . in the case of positive @xmath77 ,",
    "additional sign variables for each sequence of momenta can be easily introduced following appendix [ sec : arbitrary_coefficients ] .",
    "this will be done in the next subsection for the hermitian matrix model .",
    "note that while at finite @xmath0 the theory with negative coupling constant is not defined and the correlators are non - analytic in @xmath77 @xcite , in the leading order in @xmath0 perturbative series converge even when the coupling is negative , but not exceeding some critical value @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , in the planar approximation the correlators are analytic in @xmath77",
    ".    the space @xmath41 in ( [ random_process_eq ] ) should be the space of ordered sequences ( of any size ) of momenta @xmath36 , correspondingly , the extended configuration space is a stack which contains such sequences .",
    "it is convenient also to introduce two normalization constants @xmath78 and @xmath14 , so that the functions @xmath79 which will be estimated stochastically are defined as @xmath80 where @xmath20 is again the total volume of space . the constant @xmath14 can be thought of as the renormalization constant for the one - particle wave functions , and @xmath78 - as the overall wavefunction normalization .    in terms of the functions",
    "@xmath81 the schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_n2 ] ) and ( [ phi4_sds_momentum ] ) read :    @xmath82    comparing the schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_n2_rescaled ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_rescaled ] ) with the general equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) , we arrive at the random process which stochastically solves these equations .",
    "this random process is specified by the following probabilistic choice of actions at each discrete time step :    create : : :    with probability    @xmath83    push a new sequence of momenta    @xmath84 to the stack .",

    "push the result to the stack .",
    "restart : : :    otherwise restart with a stack containing a sequence    @xmath94 , @xmath95 being    distributed with the probability proportional to    @xmath34    since the momenta are always added to the stack in pairs which sum up to zero , for all sequences in the stack the total sum of all momenta in the sequence is always zero .",
    "the @xmath96 factors in ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_n2_rescaled ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_momentum_rescaled ] ) ensure that the probability distributions of the newly created momenta can be normalized to unity .",
    "let us check whether the inequalities ( [ probability_ineq ] ) are satisfied for such a process , that is , whether the total probability of all possible actions does not exceed unity .",
    "for the free propagator @xmath34 one has the inequalities @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the total probability of all possible actions can be then estimated as @xmath99 .",
    "clearly , for sufficiently small @xmath100 this estimate can be always made smaller than unity by increasing @xmath14 and @xmath78 . in subsections [ subsec :",
    "matrix_model ] and [ subsec : weingarten ] we will analyze such bounds on coupling constants in more details for hermitian matrix model and for the weingarten model .",
    "since the constructed process involves no permutations , one can trace the history of each momenta in the stack - from creation to joining into a vertex or a `` restart operation '' . by drawing all the momenta in stack as points on the vertical lines of some two - dimensional grid and connecting the corresponding points along the horizontal lines , all planar diagrams of the theory ( with an arbitrary number of external lines ) can be obtained .",
    "note also that the number of vertices in planar diagrams drawn by this random process can not exceed the number of time steps from the previous `` restart '' action .",
    "thus in order to maximize the mean order of diagrams which are summed up in some fixed number of time steps , it is advantageous to maximally reduce the rate of `` restart '' events , that is , to saturate the inequalities ( [ probability_ineq ] ) .",
    "one could also try to devise a random process which would solve the schwinger - dyson equations ( [ phi4_sds_original_n2 ] ) , ( [ phi4_sds_original ] ) directly in physical space - time , rather than in the momentum space .",
    "the configuration space of such a process would be the stack of sequences of points @xmath49 .",
    "as compared to the algorithm in the momentum space , there would be an additional choice of moving the last point @xmath52 in the topmost sequence to adjacent lattice sites , with the probability proportional to the hopping parameter @xmath101 .",
    "this would correspond to drawing the worldlines of virtual and real particles by bosonic random walks .",
    "interestingly , such worldlines can be mapped onto the string worldsheets in simplicial string theory @xcite .",
    "as well , the creation of a new interaction vertex would only be possible if three such random walks would intersect in one point .",
    "however , this is an unlikely event , with probability going to zero in the continuum limit .",
    "thus , solving the schwinger - dyson equations directly in the coordinate representation would lead to a less efficient numerical algorithm .",
    "note that for the theory ( [ phi4_field_action ] ) at finite @xmath0 the schwinger - dyson equations are linear equations , which are , however , defined on much larger functional space : the set of unknown functions includes also expectation values of multi - trace operators , such as @xmath102 .",
    "one can try to solve these linear equations by interpreting them as the equations for the stationary probability distribution of a markov process .",
    "the configuration space of such a process should be a space of sequences of the form @xmath103 , thus encoding the expectation values of all multi - trace operators .",
    "however , such a straightforward procedure leads to non - normalizable transition probabilities , indicating that the series which one tries to sum up are divergent .",
    "only when the terms subleading in @xmath104 are omitted from the schwinger - dyson equations , they can be interpreted as stochastic equations . at the same time",
    ", we obtain the markov process on the extended configuration space described in section [ sec : recursive_process ] , which we interpret as the stack of sequences .",

    "this work was partly supported by grants rfbr 09 - 02 - 00338-a , rfbr 08 - 02 - 00661-a , a grant for the leading scientific schools nsh-6260.2010.2 , by the federal special - purpose programme `` personnel '' of the russian ministry of science and education , and by personal grants from the `` dynasty '' foundation and from the fair - russia research center ( frrc ) .",
    "the random process described in section [ sec : recursive_process ] was devised under the assumption that the coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath269 and @xmath46 are real and positive for any @xmath2 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this appendix",
    "we show how the solution of the equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with arbitrary signs or complex phases on the r.h.s . can be reduced to the solution of another equation of the form ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with all positive coefficients , provided the inequalities ( [ probability_ineq ] )",
    "are satisfied .",
    "we begin by discussing the case of real but non - positive coefficients in details , and finally sketch the extension to complex - valued coefficients .    to this end ,",
    "let us represent the sign - alternating coefficients in ( [ random_process_eq ] ) as : @xmath270 where @xmath271 , @xmath272 and @xmath273 are all positive and also obey the following inequality : @xmath274 for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , these inequalities can be satisfied if the inequalities ( [ probability_ineq ] ) are satisfied .",
    "let us now introduce two functions @xmath275 and @xmath276 , which satisfy the following equations :      it is now easy to check that the difference @xmath278 satisfies the equation ( [ random_process_eq ] ) . on the other hand , the equations ( [ sign_alt_repr_eq ] ) again",
    "have the form of ( [ random_process_eq ] ) with all positive coefficients , but with the configuration space @xmath279 being the direct product @xmath280 .",
    "in other words , each variable @xmath2 now in addition carries the `` sign '' , @xmath281 or @xmath282 , which can be written as @xmath283 or @xmath284 . basing on the results presented in section [ sec : recursive_process ] , one can devise the random process which solves these equations :    create : : :    with probability    @xmath271 create    new element @xmath285 and push    it to the stack .",
    "evolve : : :    with probability    @xmath286 pop    the element @xmath287 from the stack    and push the element @xmath288 to the    stack , with probability    @xmath289 do    the same but flip the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "join : : :    with probability    @xmath290    consecutively pop two elements    @xmath291 ,    @xmath292 from the stack and push a    single element @xmath293 to the    stack .",
    "that is , two pluses or two minuses associated with    @xmath3 s give @xmath283 , but    one plus and one minus give @xmath284 .",
    "with probability    @xmath294    do the same , but flip the resulting sign , that is , push the element    @xmath295 to the stack .",
    "restart : : :    otherwise , empty the stack and push a single element    @xmath285 into it , with    probability proportional to    @xmath271 .    as in section",
    "[ sec : recursive_process ] , @xmath275 and @xmath276 are proportional to probabilities to find the elements @xmath283 or @xmath284 on the top of the stack , provided there is more than one element in it .",
    "the extension of this construction to complex - valued coefficients is quite straightforward .",
    "we represent the coefficients in ( [ random_process_eq ] ) as @xmath296 , where @xmath297 is real and positive , and similarly for the other coefficients .",
    "the configuration space @xmath279 becomes the direct product @xmath298 , where @xmath299 is the unit circle in the complex plane .",
    "the stack now contains the pairs @xmath300 , with @xmath301 } $ ] being the complex phase . the function @xmath48 is estimated as @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the probability to find the element @xmath300 at the top of the stack . in the random process",
    ", new elements are created with probability distribution proportional to @xmath297 , and in the `` evolve '' and the `` join '' actions the phases of the elements and the coefficients in ( [ random_process_eq ] ) are added modulo @xmath33 , similarly to signs .    note that this solution does not in general have the property of importance sampling .",
    "indeed , one can have some @xmath2 for which @xmath48 is numerically very small , but the random process can spend an almost equal large amount of time in the states @xmath283 and @xmath284 , so that numerically large @xmath275 and @xmath276 nearly cancel . whether this occurs or not depends on the particular system of equations and on the particular unknown variables , but potentially this feature can make numerical simulations less efficient ."
