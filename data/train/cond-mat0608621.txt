    "there is currently a wide effort to observe quantum behavior in nanoscale devices @xcite . in the limit of high resonator frequency with high mechanical quality factors and long coherence lifetimes , the nanomechanical oscillator ( nmo )",
    "phonons will be analogous to photons in an electromagnetic cavity . with current technology",
    "it is possible to reach resonator frequency of ghz order @xcite . at a temperature of around 50mk",
    ", one can principally prepare the resonator into the ground state .",
    "these sub - kelvin temperatures are well within the range of todays dilution refrigerators . however cooling the resonator down to these temperatures",
    "requires some other techniques @xcite .    with the assumption that quantum mechanics should apply to these mesoscopic systems , variety of methods and techniques",
    "have been proposed to observe some quantum optical effects including solid - state laser cooling @xcite , quantum nondemolition measurement @xcite , phonon lasing @xcite and squeezed state generation @xcite .",
    "there are also proposals analyzing macroscopic quantum tunneling @xcite , resonant multi - phonon excitations @xcite and a variety of methods to entangle mechanical resonators with other quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the next question is what could be the best way to study quantum properties of a nmo . in line with the work in quantum optics on squeezing , we can consider studying the squeezed states of the nmo .",
    "one proposal considers modulating the spring constant to produce squeezing @xcite as it is known from the earlier work @xcite that any modulation of the frequency of the oscillator can result in squeezing .",
    "here we adopt a different model .",
    "we consider the situation shown schematically in the fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "we show various forces acting on a nanobeam structure which is clamped at both ends vibrating in the transverse direction .",
    "there is a static mechanical force , @xmath0 , acting in the longitudinal direction and an ac - driving force to excite vibrations in the transverse direction .",
    "the longitudinal force @xmath0 which is close to a critical value at the euler instability gives rise to an additional term in the potential energy which is quartic in the fundamental mode amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian that describes the system would be in the form @xmath7 .",
    "the derivation of this nonlinearity in @xmath6 is given in the next section .",
    "unlike the previous work on squeezing @xcite in a nmo we would consider the effect of the nonlinearity in @xmath6 .",
    "note that the nonlinearity can be switched on and off by controlling @xmath0 .",
    "we would thus study the quantized behavior of a nmo subject to the force @xmath0 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the model is described in section [ model ] and the effective hamiltonian is derived briefly by referring to the previous works for the doubly clamped elastic rectangular beam .",
    "we discuss the previous works on the squeezing in nonlinear oscillators in section [ previous work ] .",
    "then , we study the quantum dynamics and analyze the squeezing properties in section [ dynamics ] .",
    "the conclusion and future perspective are given in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we start with an elastic rectangular beam of length @xmath8 , width @xmath9 and thickness @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "the beam is freely suspended and clamped at both ends .",
    "the transverse motion in the direction of @xmath10 is allowed .",
    "the dimensions are such that ( @xmath11 ) there is no appreciable vibrations in other directions .",
    "a static mechanical force @xmath0 acts on the beam in the longitudinal direction ( @xmath12 for compression ) . an ac - driving field",
    ", @xmath13 can also be added to excite the vibrations .",
    "the dynamics of the beam can be completely described by the transverse deflection @xmath14 parametrized by the arclength @xmath15 $ ] in a classical picture . assuming single transverse degree of freedom for simplicity the nonlinear lagrangian of the system , for arbitrary strong deflections @xmath14 is then @xcite ,    @xmath16.\\ ] ]    here @xmath17 is the mass density , @xmath18 is the product of the elasticity modulus @xmath19 and the moment of inertia @xmath20 . in @xmath21 ,",
    "prime denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 . for small oscillations",
    "@xmath24 , the lagrangian is quadratic and it leads to the linear equation of motion @xmath25 the equation of motion can be separated and transformed into an eigenvalue problem with boundary conditions applied to the endpoints .",
    "one can write the general solution as a superposition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the normal modes which follow as solution of the characteristic equation and @xmath28 is called the fundamental mode . for the doubly clamped nanobeam , we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the expressions for @xmath31 s",
    "are then given by a superposition of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , and the eigenfrequencies @xmath32 s are the solutions of transcendental equations . for the doubly clamped boundary conditions , when @xmath0 is close to the critical value @xmath33 , one can get the simplified fundamental frequency @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fundamental frequency of the relaxed beam(@xmath36 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is called the distance to the critical force and the system reaches to the well known euler instability when @xmath38 .",
    "the dynamics at low energies close to the euler instability will be dominated by the fundamental mode alone . the fundamental mode @xmath39",
    "can also be expanded close to the euler instability in zeroth order in @xmath40 @xmath41 since the fundamental frequency @xmath42 vanishes at the critical value @xmath5 , one has to include the contributions beyond the quadratic terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the lagrangian .",
    "the next higher order terms , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are quartic in the lagrangian . inserting the normal mode expansion @xmath47 in the lagrangian and assuming that the fundamental mode @xmath28 dominates the dynamics ( by neglecting the higher modes",
    "@xmath48 ) one can quantize the theory by introducing the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath49 with the `` coordinate '' @xmath50 .",
    "note that when the driving frequency is close to the fundamental frequency of the beam , the fundamental mode will dominate also in absence of a static longitudinal compression force @xmath0 .",
    "however , a compression force close to a critical value helps to enhance the nonlinear effects which are of the importance of this paper .    by using the above definition of coordinate and the conjugate momentum , an effective quantum mechanical time - dependent hamiltonian results describing the dynamics of a single quantum particle @xmath51 with the effective mass @xmath52 , the fundamental frequency @xmath53 and the nonlinearity parameter @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "now , eq . ( [ hamiltonian ] ) can be put in a second - quantized form by replacing @xmath6 and @xmath55 with the creation and annihilation operators @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 upon scaling the hamiltonian by @xmath59 we obtain the dimensionless form ,    @xmath60    with the redefined dimensionless parameters , @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "one can obtain an expression for @xmath63 that depends on the dimensions and the material properties of the beam . by substituting the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) one finds @xmath64 note that the equation ( [ beta ] ) is valid for @xmath65 and @xmath63 can be controlled by fine tuning the distance parameter @xmath40 at this regime .",

    "note that one should have extremely precise control over @xmath40 to increase the nonlinearity . in light of the measurements done in the experiment @xcite @xmath40",

    "the squeezing produced by the nonlinearity has been investigated in the past by using a number of approximations however none of these are suitable for the problem of the namo .",
    "milburn dropped all phase sensitive terms from ( [ ham2 ] ) and studied @xcite the simplified hamiltonian , @xmath83.\\ ] ] by solving exactly the phase space distribution function he showed that squeezing can be obtained for a coherent state of amplitude @xmath84 for very short times .",
    "buzek @xcite and tanas @xcite studied hamiltonian models of the form , @xmath85 they solved the heisenberg equations of motion exactly and showed periodic squeezing for coherent states in both quadratures .",
    "tanas @xcite showed also that maximum squeezing can be obtained in the limit of large mean number ( @xmath86 ) and small times ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "no squeezing is allowed for the vacuum ( ground ) state in the above models .    in this paper , we calculate the squeezing in an anharmonic oscillator for the anharmonicity quartic in @xmath6 which is the amplitude of the fundamental mode of the oscillation",
    ". one could write @xmath88 in terms of creation and annihilation operators as follows : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a polynomial in @xmath57 and @xmath56 of order four which is given by @xmath91 the hamiltonian containing the second and third terms given in eq .",
    "( [ x4 ] ) give rise to two - photon ( or phonons in quantum mechanical descriptions of solid systems ) transitions .",
    "it is known that two - photon transitions are necessary for producing squeezed states and thus the terms @xmath92 , @xmath93 and their hermitian conjugate should be important . in the literature , multi - photon processes have also been analyzed to study normal and higher order squeezing in the limit of small times @xcite . in relation to this paper , tombesi and mecozzi",
    "@xcite studied the harmonic oscillator model which has four - photon transitions in the interaction term , @xmath94.\\ ] ] this model was solved exactly .",
    "they showed that significant amount of normal and higher order squeezing is possible for initial coherent states of amplitude @xmath95 with certain phases and for short times .",
    "no squeezing is allowed for the vacuum and fluctuations diverge as time grows .    in the description of nmo systems the anharmonic hamiltonian models given in eqs .",
    "( [ milburn hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ buzek hamiltonian ] ) , ( [ tanas hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ f4 ] ) are no good for vacuum ( ground state ) squeezing .",
    "moreover , the nonlinearity @xmath96 can not be controlled externally since it is an intrinsic property of the medium . to observe the nonclassical ( quantum ) properties of a mesoscopic system in general",
    ", the control of the parameter that gives rise to the nonclassical behavior would be crucial for an experimentalist .",
    "the harmonic oscillator having the nonlinearity of eq .",
    "( [ x4 ] ) that we shall work in the next sections , gives important squeezing in the in - phase quadrature for both ground state and coherent states .",
    "furthermore , it will be shown in section iii that the physical model of the nmo allows one to control the nonlinearity by the application of a static external force .",
    "the numerical solution of the hamiltonian shows that the ground state squeezing displays periodicity and it stays squeezed for the whole cycle of the period .",
    "in fact , the ground state squeezing is important for the mesoscopic resonators because bringing the harmonic oscillator representing the nanomechanical system to its vibrational ground state is a necessary prerequisite for quantum state engineering .",
    "the effect of driving term is also examined .",
    "we first consider the case in which there is no driving .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath97 has no analytical solution . for the numerical calculations , we employ the split - operator method @xcite for the time propagation of the initial state .",
    "in this method , one can split the propagator on a time step @xmath98 as @xmath99\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "that means splitting the exponential of the operators which are not commuting is accurate to second order in the time step @xmath98 .",
    "therefore one can make the calculation as accurate as possible by taking the time step sufficiently small .",
    "now we are ready to analyze the dynamics of the oscillations of the fundamental mode .",
    "we take the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath102 as our initial state .",
    "then we analyze the dynamics by the application of compressive force @xmath0 suddenly ( in a time interval much faster than the oscillator s frequency ) in the regime near to the euler instability where the nonlinearity parameter @xmath63 can go from negligibly small values ( where the dynamics is largely governed by ) to appreciable values .",
    "one can see how the nonlinearity parameter @xmath63 changes by tuning the distance parameter @xmath40 in the table [ table1 ] .",
    "we examine the dynamics by calculating the time evolution of the width of initial wave function in the  coordinate \"- space , i.e. @xmath6-space ( we take the amplitude of the transverse deflection of the nmo as our coordinate as explained in section ii . ) and the corresponding momentum - space , i.e. @xmath55-space .",
    "next , we define the squeezing factors @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 are the widths in coordinate and momentum space of the initial wave function .",
    "the squeezing occurs when one of the expressions in eqs .",
    "[ xsqueezing ] and [ psqueezing ] get less than one and it is said to be perfect when it gets zero .",
    "[ fig02 ] shows squeezing for the ground state for different nonlinearity values @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "one could also start with a coherent state to check squeezing . to prepare the coherent state ,",
    "just as in the preparation of ground state mentioned in the previous paragraph , one can first start with the linear harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath102 .",
    "then the coherent state can be obtained by resonantly driving ( e.g. by a harmonic electromotive force ) @xcite the systems ground state .",
    "thereafter , by switching the nonlinearity suddenly the dynamics of squeezing can be obtained .",
    "we analyzed squeezing for different initial coherent state amplitudes and phases , @xmath110 , at the nonlinearity value of @xmath111 .",
    "[ fig03 ] shows the time evolution of the squeezing for increasing coherent state amplitude @xmath112 at the phase @xmath113 .",
    "[ fig04 ] shows the dependence of the maximum squeezing to the phase .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the phase does not make much difference for low amplitudes ( @xmath114 ) but it changes squeezing behavior drastically for amplitudes larger than @xmath115 . increasing the amplitude increases the maximum squeezing whereas the state never becomes squeezed after a short duration . on the other hand ,",
    "low amplitudes shows periodic squeezing all the time at a moderate value .",
    "one can also plot the time evolution of the uncertainty product @xmath116 for the ground state wave function of the linear hamiltonian @xmath102 .",
    "[ fig05 ] shows that the oscillator recovers its minimum uncertainty periodically and the fluctuation remains bounded .",
    "next we analyze the effect of driving in the dynamics of the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "we calculate the propagator again by using the split - operator method .",
    "this time , we include the nonlinear term into @xmath102 and we take the time dependent driving term as @xmath117 to employ the splitting given in eq .",
    "( [ split - operator ] ) .",
    "[ fig06 ] shows the time evolution of the squeezing factors given in eqs .",

    "we take the ground state of the linear hamiltonian as the initial state .",
    "the frequency of the driving term , @xmath122 , is on resonance with the frequency of the oscillator , @xmath42 . as clearly seen , the effect of the driving is to enhance the squeezing in @xmath6 periodically to a larger value . for the values of @xmath123 in consideration ,",
    "maximum squeezing goes from @xmath124 ( for @xmath118 ) to @xmath125 ( for @xmath126 ) .",
    "increasing the driving further does not enhance squeezing , rather it starts to enhance the fluctuations and the squeezing cycle becomes shorter . and the driving frequencies off the resonance does not help enhancing the squeezing at all .",
    "the upper limit @xmath127 for the regime of validity of the fundamental mode description is given by the first harmonic threshold , that is @xmath128 @xcite which means for the dimensionless parameter , @xmath129 .",
    "we include the damping effects in the master equation formalism of the form @xmath130+\\gamma ( a\\rho a^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}\\,a^{\\dag}a\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\rho a^{\\dag}a),\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the hamiltonian given by the eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) and @xmath132 is the damping constant . here , @xmath132 is the rate for the oscillator to decay from the first excited state to the ground state .",
    "the rate for the decay from level @xmath133 to @xmath134 is @xmath135 . after solving the master equation",
    "numerically we plot the squeezing factors @xmath136 and @xmath137 in figs . [",
    "fig07](a ) and [ fig07](b ) for the ground state .",
    "as seen clearly , the damping effect shows itself as reducing the fluctuations exponentially to a steady state value .",
    "the master equation formalism also allows us to analyze the squeezing for the thermal state of the relaxed beam ( described by the linear hamiltonian @xmath102 ) , @xmath138 , where @xmath100 , @xmath139 and @xmath140",
    ". figs . [ fig07](c ) and [ fig07](d ) show that one need not to start at 0 k to obtain squeezing . as long as one keeps the noise of the environment",
    "sufficiently low , at higher temperatures of the beam ( @xmath141 of fractions of the level spacing @xmath142 ) , although there is no substantial squeezing initially , at steady state , the amount of  coordinate \" squeezing is reaching to the ground state value .",
    "in this paper we show that squeezed states can be obtained in the amplitude of the fundamental mode of a nanomechanical oscillator which has quartic nonlinearity in its effective single particle quantum mechanical hamiltonian .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the system is solved numerically both with and without external ac - driving . for various strength of nonlinearity and driving ,",
    "the squeezing dynamics is investigated for both initial ground state and coherent states of different amplitudes .",
    "the terms that lead to multilevel transitions in the quartic nonlinearity is compared to similar models and proved advantageous results .",
    "it should be noted that working closer to euler buckling instability produces larger squeezing due to large nonlinearity .",
    "this is reminiscent of similar result for quantum optical systems @xcite .",
    "finally , we comment on the possibility of observing squeezing in nanomechanical beams .",
    "the obvious way to detect squeezing seems to be one of the displacement detection methods .",
    "there are different displacement sensing techniques such as optical , magnetomotive and single - electron transistor ( set ) technique . among these readout strategies ,",
    "the set demonstrated by many research groups to be a very sensitive detector of charge enables position detection for nmo devices in their low energy quantum states . in this detection method ,",
    "a charged nmo is capacitively coupled to an set .",
    "the oscillator s motion induces a change in the charge on the gate electrode of the set and the change in the set s conductance can be directly monitored .",
    "demonstrations of position detection of nmo s are developing . the first experiment @xcite reached the position sensitivity within a factor of 100 of the quantum limit @xmath143 . a year after another group",
    "@xcite improved this sensitivity to a factor of 4.3 of the quantum limit set by the heisenberg uncertainty principle of a nanomechanical resonator nearly its ground state .",
    "these demonstrations suggests that beating the standard quantum limit in the position detection technology is highly probable in future .",
    "once this is achieved , by reading out the position each time with a different nonlinearity parameter one can prove the existence of tunable squeezing .",
    "there are also proposals suggesting the positioning of a nmo inside an electromagnetic cavity .",
    "it is proposed that the interaction of cavity photons with a nmo in a squeezed state would produce a nonclassical statistics of photons at the exit .",
    "so one can easily detect squeezing simply by quantum statistical analysis of photons at the output of the cavity .    in conclusion , in nanomechanical beams described in this paper , one can remarkably control the quantum squeezing externally just by controlling the strain provided by a classical compressive force .",
    "however , to control the nonlinearity at the desired values , one would have to apply compression with extreme delicacy , @xmath144 .",
    "controlling the strain to this precision for sufficient time to identify squeezing may be difficult .",
    "thus , while observing squeezing will be challenging , the prospect of exploring tunable quantum squeezing in nanomechanical beams and the connection to euler buckling instability are intriguing .",
