    "billiards on surfaces of negative curvature were first investigated by j. hadamard @xcite . the case of constant negative curvature , known as the pseudosphere , has enjoyed considerable popularity since gutzwiller s realization @xcite of its potential as a paradigm of quantum chaos .",
    "complete hyperbolicity , the availability of symbolic dynamics , the equality of the lyapunov exponents of all periodic orbits , and the validity of selberg s trace formula are among the attractive features of that system .",
    "useful introductions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . for a tesselation by",
    "maximally desymmetrized octagons ( see below ) aurich and steiner found the spectral fluctuations of the quantum energy spectrum faithful to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random - matrix theory @xcite , as illustrated in fig .  1 for the so - called form factor , the fourier transform of the energy dependent two - point correlator of the density of levels .",
    "one of the urgent problems in quantum chaology is to understand the rather universal validity of random - matrix type spectral fluctuations for chaotic dynamical systems , nowadays known as the bohigas - giannoni - schmit conjecture @xcite .",
    "an important first step was made by berry @xcite on the basis of gutzwiller s trace formula @xcite which expresses the oscillatory part of the density of energy levels as a sum over periodic orbits , @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the action and @xmath2 a classical stability amplitude of the periodic orbit @xmath3 .",
    "berry realized that the double sum over periodic orbits in the form factor , which involves the building block @xmath4 in each summand , must draw an important contribution from the diagonal terms @xmath5 since pairs of orbits with action differences larger than planck s unit @xmath6 can be expected to interfere destructively and thus to cancel in the form factor . for time reversal",
    "invariant systems each orbit @xmath3 and its time reverse @xmath7 have equal action such that berry s `` diagonal approximation '' generalizes to include pairs of mutually time reversed orbits and then gives the time dependent form factor as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time in units of the so called heisenberg time , which is given in terms of the mean level density @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "recently , sieber and richter @xcite employed the pseudosphere in their pioneering move beyond the diagonal approximation ; they found a one - parameter family of orbit pairs within which the action difference can be steered to zero .",
    "one orbit within each `` sieber - richter pair '' undergoes a small - angle self - crossing which the partner orbit narrowly avoids .",
    "the form factor receives the contribution @xmath12 from the family .",
    "together with berry s @xmath13 we thus have a semiclassical understanding of at least the first two terms in the taylor series of the random - matrix form factor @xcite @xmath14 .",
    "the search is now on for further families of orbit pairs which might yield the higher - order terms of the expansion . at the same time , one would like and will eventually have to go beyond the pseudosphere , in order to find the conditions for universal behavior ; interesting first steps have been taken for quantum graphs @xcite and other billiards @xcite .    in the present paper we remain with the pseudosphere for a thorough investigation of action correlations which we feel necessary as a basis for further progress towards an understanding of the random - matrix like spectral fluctuations in this prototypical dynamical system ( and beyond ) .",
    "we shall make extensive use of symbolic dynamics in ( i ) establishing a certain local character of the relation between an orbit and its symbol sequence ( only a section of the symbol sequence is necessary to determine the associated section of the orbit ) , ( ii ) constructing very long periodic orbits ( up to hundreds of thousands of symbols ) with full control of accuracy , ( iii ) identifying the ergodic ones among them and establishing a simple and instructive rederivation of huber s exponential - proliferation law , ( iv ) expressing the angle @xmath15 of a self - crossing and the closest - approach distance @xmath16 in the partner orbit of a sieber - richter pair in terms of the mbius - transformation matrices associated with the loops joined in a crossing , ( v ) revealing a useful analytic - continuation kinship of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , ( vi ) explicitly relating the joint density @xmath17 for crossing angles and loop lengths @xmath18 in orbits of total length @xmath19 to the associated density @xmath20 for avoided crossings , and ( vii ) constructing an expression for the action difference of a sieber - richter pair valid to all orders in @xmath15 .",
    "some of our findings are based on ( overwhelming and exceptionless ) numerical evidence based on large numbers of long periodic orbits and thus call for mathematical substantiation .    even though we strictly confine ourselves to the pseudosphere we expect ( and",
    "have indeed begun to check ) generalizability to other systems for which symbolic dynamics is available .",
    "the hadamard - gutzwiller model @xcite is a two - dimensional billiard on the so called poincar disc , i.e. the unit disc @xmath21 endowed with the metric @xmath22 the distance @xmath23 between two points @xmath24 , measured along the unique geodesic connecting them , reads @xmath25    the geodesics are circles intersecting the boundary at right angles .",
    "the total length of the geodesics between its two crossing points with the disc boundary is infinite signaling non - compactness .",
    "free motion on that space is completely hyperbolic .",
    "all trajectories ( geodesics ) have the same lyapunov exponent , @xmath26 , and that fact makes for great simplifications as compared to usual billiards in flat space .",
    "the poincar disc can be regarded as the stereographic projection of the pseudosphere , the surface of constant negative curvature .",
    "the symmetry of the poincar disc is described by the non - compact lorentz group @xmath27 ; we shall only be interested in its hyperbolic elements which are matrices with the structure @xmath28 inner points of the poincar disc are transformed to inner points , and boundary points @xmath29 to boundary points . two boundary points @xmath30 remain invariant , @xmath31 and similar for @xmath32 ; the indices signaling `` stable '' and `` unstable '' . using @xmath33",
    "we find    @xmath34    where @xmath35 refers to the @xmath36 sign , and @xmath37 to the @xmath38 sign in the case @xmath39 ; if @xmath40 the opposite sign assignment applies .",
    "repeated application of the transformation @xmath41 on any point @xmath42 leads to the stable fixed point , @xmath43 for @xmath44 , while iteration of the inverse map leads to the unstable fixed point , @xmath45 .",
    "the geodesic passing through @xmath46 and @xmath32 ( to be called the `` own '' geodesic of the matrix @xmath47 ) is invariant with respect to @xmath41 : if @xmath48 belongs to this geodesic then so does @xmath49 .",
    "the distance @xmath50 is the same for all points of the geodesic and equals    @xmath51    the inverse @xmath52 of a matrix @xmath41 is obtained by the replacement @xmath53 in ( [ su11matrix ] ) .",
    "these two matrices have their stable and unstable points interchanged .",
    "consequently , a matrix and its inverse shift points along their common `` own '' geodesic by the same distance but in opposite directions .    to obtain a model with compact configuration space",
    "the poincar disc is tesselated with tiles of equal area and shape .",
    "each type of tesselation is connected with a particular discrete infinite subgroup @xmath54 of @xmath27 such that by acting on all inner points of a tile by some fixed matrix @xmath55 we get all inner points of some other tile ; the boundaries are mapped to boundaries of the same or other tiles .",
    "using all @xmath56 we get all tiles and restore the whole disc from a single initial tile . a particular tile is distinguished by containing the origin @xmath57 and is called the fundamental domain .",
    "in fact , different tiles are identified by identifying each point @xmath42 of the poincar disc with all its images @xmath58 , and so a compact configuration space is indeed arrived at .    in the present paper we exclusively work with octagonal tiles which are all identified with the fundamental domain .",
    "the opposite sides of the latter are glued together such that we arrive at a riemann surface of genus 2 , i.e. a two - hole doughnut .",
    "matrices @xmath59 giving rise to octagonal tiles are arbitrary products of four elementary group elements @xmath60 and their inverses . for simplicity",
    ", we shall mostly consider tesselation with `` regular octagons '' ( fig .  [ nozwei ] ) which have the highest possible symmetry ; the pertinent elementary matrices @xmath61 are @xmath62 and their inverses .",
    "the inverse of @xmath63 is easily checked to be @xmath64 . since the index @xmath65 describes a phase in the off - diagonal matrix elements we conclude @xmath66 where we have introduced @xmath67 .",
    "the full set of elementary matrices is thus @xmath68 .",
    "the sides of the boundary of the fundamental domain can now be labeled @xmath69 and constructed as follows .",
    "tesselation identifies opposite sides of the regular octagon as 0 @xmath70 4 , 1 @xmath70 5 , 2 @xmath70 6 , and 3 @xmath70 7 .",
    "points on side @xmath71 are thus images of their mirror symmetric counterparts on side @xmath65 ; the group element responsible for such imaging is @xmath64 . in particular , the points on side 0 solve the quadratic equation @xmath72 and form a circle of radius @xmath73 , which is in fact a geodesic .",
    "side @xmath65 is obtained by a rotation of side 0 by @xmath74 .",
    "= 0.35    elementary matrices other than @xmath64 lead from points on side @xmath65 of the fundamental domain to boundary sides in the next generation of tiles , which may be called `` higher brillouin zones '' , using an analogy with periodic lattices . obviously , there are eight brillouin zones neighboring to the fundamental domain . in all other brillouin zones of all generations ,",
    "opposite sides are still identified .",
    "all brillouin zones have the same octagonal shape and the same area as the fundamental domain ; their visual difference in size and form is caused by the metric ( [ metric ] ) .    in",
    "what follows , we shall often call the elementary matrices @xmath63 `` letters '' , and their products @xmath75 `` words '' . as a convenient shorthand for a word we shall also employ",
    "just the string of indices of the letters , i.e. @xmath76 .    = 0.3    as already mentioned , the identification of points @xmath77 implies gluing together opposite sides of the octagon ; the result is a riemann surface of genus @xmath78 . on that surface ,",
    "the eight corner points of the octagon in the unit disc coincide .",
    "the identification of the corner points is shown in fig .",
    "starting from any corner , ( for instance @xmath79 in the figure ) , taking into account that elementary matrices map opposite points of the boundaries of the fundamental domain onto each other , we go through all corners and come back after eight steps , and read off @xmath80 . due to the fact that the fixed - point equation @xmath81 for @xmath82 has unimodular solutions @xmath83",
    ", we conclude that the matrix product @xmath84 must be the identity , since the corner point @xmath79 obviously fulfills @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , using the explicit form ( [ elem ] ) of the @xmath63 , one checks that the foregoing product of eight matrices is the @xmath86 unit matrix ,    @xmath87    any geodesic in the tesselated unit disc can be folded into the fundamental domain where it will look like a sequence of disjoint circular segments starting and ending on the boundaries of the octagon .",
    "of course , when the fundamental tile is regarded as a surface of genus 2 the circular sections in question no longer appear as disjoint : a trajectory leaving the fundamental domain through one of the eight sides of the octagon and reentering on the opposite side appears as a smooth curve on the genus 2 surface .",
    "it is only after representing the whole unit disc by a single tile with opposite sides glued together ( or , equivalently by a surface of genus 2 ) that a geodesic is capable of self - crossings .",
    "consider now inertial motion along the `` own '' geodesic of a matrix @xmath88 .",
    "any point @xmath42 of the geodesic and its image @xmath89 ( which we know to belong to the same geodesic ) are identified by the tesselation .",
    "geodesically moving from @xmath42 to @xmath58 we are in fact traversing a periodic orbit associated with @xmath59 , and the length of that periodic orbit is given by ( [ 1.1 ] ) ; the time reversed orbit is similarly associated with the matrix @xmath90 .",
    "since each @xmath88 can be written as a product of elementary matrices @xmath91 and encoded by the symbolic word @xmath92 we have in fact symbolic dynamics at our disposal as a tool for investigating of periodic orbits . for words in the sense of symbol sequences and @xmath93 for the associated mbius - transformation matrices . ]",
    "all matrices from an equivalence class @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is any matrix from @xmath96 , have their `` own '' geodesics identified by tesselation ; there is thus one and one only periodic orbit per equivalence class in @xmath54 . an infinite number of words pertaining to the same equivalence class and thus referring to the same periodic orbit can be obtained from one representative word @xmath97 ; this is done by cyclic permutations of the letters , by similarity transforms ( replacing @xmath59 by the longer word @xmath98 where @xmath95 is another word , and its associate @xmath99 stands for the matrix inverse to the one represented by @xmath100 ; the superscript `` tr '' is read as `` time reversed '' ) , and by using the group identity ( [ ide ] ) in all its various forms .",
    "a code of the time reversed periodic orbit is produced from the original @xmath59 by writing its symbols @xmath101 in the opposite order and replacing each @xmath101 by @xmath102 .    like any geodesic",
    "the periodic orbit can be folded into the fundamental domain where it will consist of a finite number @xmath103 of disjoined circular segments .",
    "after that a distinguished @xmath103-letter word can be introduced for the orbit which is simply the sequence of the `` landing '' sides of the orbit segments .",
    "( the `` launching '' side is always opposite to the `` landing '' side of the preceding segment and is not admitted to the symbolic code . )",
    "this encoding contains the least possible number of symbols among all members of the equivalence class , and is unique up to cyclic permutations .",
    "all @xmath103 `` own '' geodesics of a matrix @xmath59 encoded by the distinguished word and its cyclic permutations , cross the fundamental domain .",
    "= 0.25    as an example of how to construct an orbit from its symbol sequence we consider the word @xmath104 .",
    "its `` own '' geodesic can be found calculating the matrix product @xmath105 and geodesically joining the respective fixed points ( eq.([fp ] ) ) , the curve @xmath106 in fig .",
    "the full orbit within the fundamental domain could be obtained by folding the geodesic @xmath106 back into that domain .",
    "however , it is easier to find the``own '' geodesic of the cyclicly permuted matrix @xmath107 and joining its fixed points @xmath108 .",
    "the orbit in the fundamental domain is now given by the `` inner parts '' of the two geodesics ( bold intervals of @xmath106 and @xmath109 in fig .",
    "the `` non - primed '' segment of the orbit starts on side 2 and ends on side 3 , while the `` primed '' one starts on 7 and ends on 6 .",
    "the time reversed orbit would have the launching and landing sides interchanged such that its word would be @xmath110 .",
    "tesselation with less symmetric octagons , also corresponding to a genus 2 riemann surface , can be implemented with four elementary matrices @xmath111 and their inverses @xmath112 , chosen such that all eight matrices obey the group identity ( [ ide ] ) .",
    "interestingly , completely desymmetrized genus 2 surfaces do not exist : the inversion symmetry under @xmath113 can only be destroyed for @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "we here propose a new method for constructing very long periodic orbits .",
    "let us consider a many - letter word @xmath115 and its matrix @xmath116 . in order to explicitly construct the associated periodic orbit we can proceed stepwise , so as to determine each of the @xmath103 circular segments separately .",
    "each step uses only part of the word @xmath59 ( the symbol assigned to a segment and its near neighbors ) ; the necessary length of that part is determined by the required accuracy and not at all by the length of @xmath59 .    in the preceding section",
    ", we discussed the connection between the fixed points @xmath117 of the mbius transformation associated with @xmath118 and the periodic orbit .",
    "we would also like to recall that the two fixed points determine the circular segment associated with the first letter @xmath119 of the word ; to find the next circular segment one has to determine the two fixed points for the equivalent word obtained by cyclically permuting @xmath119 to the right end .",
    "this is how all @xmath103 circular segments of the orbit in question can be found , one after the other .",
    "it is convenient to first determine the stable fixed point for the first circular segment . to that end",
    ", we consider the sequence of matrices @xmath120 which are obtained by truncating @xmath59 .",
    "for each matrix in the sequence we solve the quadratic fixed - point equation .",
    "the sequence of unstable fixed points thus obtained behaves erratically .",
    "the sequence of stable fixed points , however , converges rapidly , in fact with exponentially growing accuracy .",
    "the limiting point itself is none other than the stable fixed point @xmath46 of the whole word beginning with @xmath119 .",
    "the convergence of the series of stable fixed points of @xmath121 can be ascertained analytically . to that end",
    "we first observe that the matrix @xmath121 has its elements grow exponentially with the length @xmath19 of its corresponding periodic orbit .",
    "this is obvious from the relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) of the length of an orbit to the trace of its matrix , @xmath122 , and from the unimodularity of the determinant , @xmath123 .",
    "while under other circumstances such exponential growth gives rise to inaccuracy growing out of control , we can now rejoice in the growth working in our favor when determining the stable fixed point of @xmath124 : for large matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) simplifies to    @xmath125    when proceeding to @xmath126 by including the letter @xmath127 and comparing the stable fixed points @xmath128 of @xmath129 , we find for their difference , using the approximation ( [ qwq ] ) and the unimodularity of @xmath130 ,    @xmath131    since the elements @xmath132 are of order unity , the difference @xmath133 is of order @xmath134 , i.e. small once the word @xmath121 is long .",
    "exponentially fast convergence of the sequence @xmath135 is thus obvious .",
    "we can now turn to the task of determining the unstable fixed point of @xmath136 .",
    "as explained in the last section , the time reversed orbit is obtained using the reversed mbius transformation matrix @xmath137 , which has stable and unstable fixed points interchanged relative to @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , we get the unstable fixed point of the circular segment of @xmath59 associated with the letter @xmath119 as the limit of the sequence of stable fixed points of the matrices @xmath138 ; these matrices are truncations of @xmath139 .",
    "the sequence of stable fixed points of these truncations converges as rapidly as the one considered before and yields the unstable fixed point @xmath32 for the first circular segment of @xmath59 .    with both @xmath32 and @xmath46 determined to the desired accuracy for the segment of the orbit corresponding to @xmath119 , one repeats the procedure for the subsequent circular segment , i.e. the one corresponding to @xmath140 .    as an obvious property of our method",
    ", we find that the computational effort needed to construct a periodic orbit with @xmath141 symbols grows only linearly with @xmath103 .",
    "more importantly , we only have to do local work for local properties : each of the @xmath103 circular segments of the orbit inside the fundamental domain is found with a number of operations independent of @xmath103 ; for each segment one has to calculate a product of a moderate number of elementary matrices ( about 18 for a 15-digit accuracy ) .",
    "as we proceed segmentwise , no inaccuracy can accumulate .",
    "there is thus practically no limit on the length of the accessible orbits .",
    "for example , we had no difficulty in calculating a periodic orbit corresponding to a sequence of @xmath142 randomly selected symbols",
    ".    it may be useful to again comment on the fact that any periodic orbit is , in principle , determined by any one of its circular segments within the fundamental domain .",
    "one just has to take the full geodesic running between the fixed points @xmath143 , to which the segment belongs , and fold that geodesi c into the fundamental domain .",
    "however , such folding is numerically unstable and can not be implemented with finite precision for very long orbits .",
    "inasmuch as we work with fixed points of mbius transformations , our method seems to be restricted to the hadamard - gutzwiller model .",
    "however , underlying all technicalities is a locality in the relationship between orbits and symbolic words , and that locality does in fact make our method generalizable , as will be explained in a separate publication .",
    "the locality of the word - orbit relationship makes our method a promising pruning tool .",
    "pruning generally means recognizing and deleting symbolic words not corresponding to physically realizable orbits @xcite . in the hadamard - gutzwiller model every word @xmath59",
    "does correspond to an allowed orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "there are infinitely many equivalent words which must be counted only once whenever sums over orbits are to be taken , as for instance in selberg s trace formula .",
    "the particular word we are interested in is simply the ordered list of `` landing sides '' of the regular octagon for the succession of circular segments of the orbit ( section [ hadamard ] ) .",
    "the task of selecting this distinguished word can be regarded as a variant of pruning .",
    "a first step is to discard words which can be shortened , considering that the distinguished representation contains the least possible number of symbols ; in particular , the word must not contain pairs of symbols @xmath144 with @xmath145 . the group identity ( [ ide ] )",
    "is yet another source of `` badness '' : whenever it allows to replace a word by an equivalent shorter one , only the latter needs to be further scrutinized .",
    "real problems are due to the fact that the group identity ( [ ide ] ) allows to write some four - letter parts of words in reversed order , e.g. @xmath146 .",
    "the average number of such reversible 4-sequences in a word with @xmath103 random symbols is estimated in appendix a as @xmath147 .",
    "each of the 4-sequences must have a uniquely defined direction in the distinguished word ; it is not known _ a priori _ , however , which direction is the `` correct '' one .",
    "the suitable word has thus to be selected among @xmath148 candidates .",
    "for , say , @xmath149 no hope can be set on any trial - and - error procedure like building the orbits corresponding to the equivalent words one by one and discarding those not lying inside the fundamental domain .",
    "with our algorithm we had no problem finding the correct direction of the @xmath150-letter sequences just mentioned .",
    "whenever at some stage our method produced an arc which did not cross the fundamental domain , the letter for that arc turned up within a reversible @xmath150-sequence . upon reversing that particular @xmath150-sequence ( out of the thousands present in the code ! ) the arc always returned to the fundamental domain , and construction of the periodic orbit could be continued .",
    "pruning thus becomes a local problem , which can be attacked efficiently .",
    "it is well known that the geodesic flow in the hadamard - gutzwiller model is ergodic @xcite such that almost all trajectories cover the phase space homogeneously . introducing limited phase - space resolution",
    "we can extend the notion of ergodicity to periodic orbits : almost all sufficiently long periodic orbits cover the coarse - grained phase space uniformly .",
    "the overwhelming prevalence of ergodic periodic orbits does not imply that a _ random _ sequence of _ uncorrelated _ symbols must yield an ergodic orbit .",
    "in fact , practically every periodic orbit so constructed is extremely non - ergodic , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cake](a ) by the configuration - space density for 100000 randomly chosen symbols ; the grossly non - uniform density thus incurred is anything but ergodic .",
    "= 0.95    in configuration space , a long periodic orbit intersects itself many times , and the distribution of self - crossing angles @xmath15 provides another sensitive test for ergodicity",
    ". we shall consider it in some detail because of its role in the sieber - richter theory .",
    "the angle @xmath151 , defined to lie in the interval @xmath152 , is complementary to the angle between the velocities at the crossing ; see fig .",
    "[ schnee ] .",
    "the number of self - crossings with crossing angles in the interval @xmath153 in periodic orbits of length @xmath19 yields a density @xmath154 . since no direction is distinguished the probability that an element @xmath155 of the orbit intersects with the element @xmath156 is given by the geometric projection @xmath157 . comparing that prediction with the plot of @xmath154 , numerically obtained for our periodic orbit with 100000 randomly chosen symbols",
    ", we encounter blatant disagreement , despite the enormous length of the orbit .",
    "in particular , for small @xmath15 , the number @xmath154 of self - crossings decreases like @xmath158 rather than @xmath159 .",
    "= 0.6    it is important to stress that the non - ergodic patterns in figs .",
    "[ cake](a ) and [ schnee ] are not due to an unlucky choice of the periodic orbit by the random - number generator employed to pick symbols .",
    "as we shall see presently , two precautions must be taken for our way towards ergodic periodic orbits .",
    "first , we should fix the geometric length @xmath19 rather than the number @xmath103 of symbols and , second , wave good - bye to the assumption of uncorrelated symbols .      within an ensemble of orbits of fixed number of symbols",
    "@xmath103 the orbit length @xmath19 will fluctuate .",
    "ascribing equal probability to all allowed symbol sequences and invoking , for large @xmath103 , the central limit theorem we have the distribution of @xmath19 as a gaussian , with mean and variance both proportional to @xmath103 ,    @xmath160    @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the mean length and variance per symbol .",
    "the values of these quantities are system specific ; using an ensemble of 100000 periodic orbits with @xmath163 randomly selected symbols each for the regular octagon we numerically find    @xmath164    the concentration of @xmath165 in the vicinity of its maximum becomes ever more pronounced as @xmath103 grows",
    ". the mean length per symbol for a long periodic orbit obtained by throwing honest dice for its symbols will therefore almost certainly be very close to @xmath161 .    of greater interest",
    "is a different ensemble of periodic orbits , which has the length interval @xmath166 fixed rather than the number of symbols @xmath103 . in particular , it is the fixed - length ensemble that one has in mind when speaking about the overwhelming prevalence of ergodic orbits . to find the number of orbits @xmath167 in the length interval @xmath168",
    "we need the number of different periodic orbits with @xmath103 symbols ,    @xmath169    where the effective number of symbols @xmath170 deviates only slightly from the naive estimate @xmath171 obtained by excluding @xmath144 patterns ; the slight deviation is due to the group identity ( [ ide ] ) ; the factor @xmath172 reflects the equivalence of cyclically permuted symbol sequences ; a detailed discussion of @xmath173 will be presented in appendix [ peffa ] .",
    "we proceed to @xmath174 by summing over all possibilities for the length to lie in the interval @xmath168 as @xmath175 or , approximating the sum by an integral ,    @xmath176    in the interesting case of large @xmath19 the integral can be evaluated using the saddle - point approximation .",
    "the saddle of the integrand lies at    @xmath177    = 0.4    the orbit density is thus found to obey the familiar exponential proliferation law @xmath178 with the growth rate    @xmath179    the latter rate must coincide with the topological entropy . for billiards on surfaces of constant negative curvature that entropy equals unity and ( [ huber ] )",
    "becomes huber s law @xcite . with our approximate numerical values ( [ numval ] )",
    "inserted , our expression ( [ etaeq1 ] ) yields @xmath180 , in nice agreement with the value @xmath181 required by huber s law .",
    "the orbits described by the proliferation law ( [ huber ] ) are known to be ergodic in their overwhelming majority . since we have just seen this law to arise mostly from contributions of orbits with the number of symbols close to @xmath182 ,",
    "it is clear that the ergodic orbits must have the mean length per symbol given by    @xmath183    for the regular octagon , with its values for @xmath184 given in ( [ numval ] ) we have @xmath185 .",
    "note that this latter value strongly deviates from the mean length per symbol @xmath186 obtained from randomly chosen sequences of @xmath103 symbols .",
    "therefore , orbits generated using random sequences of @xmath103 symbols have an exceedingly small probability to be ergodic . to see this we must realize that the orbits constituting the maximum of the integrand in the distribution at fixed length ( [ fixedl ] ) ( known to be ergodic ) are not those forming the maximum of the gaussian distribution ( [ gauss ] ) at fixed number of symbols , but rather belong to its ultra - left wing ; the difference of the locations of the maxima of the two distributions in question is of order @xmath19 , while the widths are only of order @xmath187 .",
    "the enormous difference between the two ensembles is due to the exponential growth of the total number of orbits with @xmath103 symbols , @xmath188 .",

    "the code @xmath404 of the partner orbit with an avoided crossing will then , however , not always be pruned , and the partner orbit will sometimes not have all its circular sections within the fundamental domain .",
    "an example of a bisection of a pruned word for which partial time reversal yields a non - pruned word is provided by @xmath405 .",
    "then the symbolic word of the partner @xmath406 obviously contains mutually canceling parts , and @xmath407 may become the standard encoding of an orbit in the fundamental domain .",
    "however , the avoided - crossing width in this case will be determined by the function @xmath408 in whose arguments the insertion @xmath95 may not be dropped .",
    "this situation occurs when the geodesic determining the width of the avoided crossing consists of several segments when depicted inside the octagon ( see the preceding section ) .",
    "there is no reason not to take into account avoided crossings of the type just characterized .",
    "an orbit with an avoided crossing may thus contain fewer symbols and be appreciably shorter than its partner with a crossing .",

    "one might be tempted to infer that in each long ergodic orbit the number of crossings must be equal to the number of avoided crossings , but that temptation must be resisted . given a fixed length @xmath19 , there are fewer crossings than avoided crossings simply since by replacing a crossing with an avoided crossing one gets a shorter periodic orbit .",
    "therefore , to obtain all avoided crossings with a certain width @xmath16 in the periodic orbits of length @xmath19 one has to make the crossing to avoided - crossing replacement in all orbits of length @xmath409 with suitable length increments @xmath410 , and longer orbits are more numerous due the exponential proliferation .    to find the relation between the density @xmath411 of crossing angles and the density @xmath386 of the avoided - crossing widths we write the total number of crossings in all periodic orbits with lengths in the interval @xmath412 $ ] as @xmath413 with huber s proliferation law @xmath414 . on the other hand",
    ", the number of avoided crossings with width @xmath16 in these orbits will equal the number of all crossings in the `` parent '' orbits whose lengths lie in @xmath415 $ ] which is @xmath416 .",
    "we may thus write @xmath417 where the approximate - equality sign again signals large @xmath19 .",

    "similarly , we may combine ( [ lengths ] ) and ( [ approco ] ) to @xmath438 and thus get the length ( and thus action ) difference for an orbit with a self - crossing and its partner avoiding that crossing , @xmath439 the latter relation generalizes the result of sieber and richter @xcite , @xmath440 , to all orders in @xmath15 .",
