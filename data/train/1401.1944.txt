    "small cell networks have attracted a lot of attention recently as they are considered a promising method to satisfy the ever increasing rate demands of wireless users .",
    "these networks are based on densely - deployed , low - cost access points ( aps ) whose density @xmath0 approaches the density @xmath1 of user equipments ( ues ) @xcite , @xcite . in order to exploit the full system resources ,",
    "traditional frequency reuse schemes are not employed which inevitably results in significant interference that has to be taken carefully into account in system design and performance analysis .    with an increasing network density ,",
    "the task of optimally placing the aps on the euclidean plane becomes difficult , if not impossible .",
    "therefore , the aps will typically have an irregular , random deployment which is expected to affect system performance .",
    "recent research has showed that such randomly deployed systems can be successfully analyzed by employing tools from stochastic geometry @xcite .",
    "while significant results have been achieved @xcite , @xcite , most of these works ( a ) assume @xmath1 much larger than @xmath0 , and/or ( b ) ignore the effect of multiple access on performance .",
    "this inevitably leads to focusing only on a single resource block and a corresponding analysis on the achieved signal - to - interference ( sir ) ratio .",
    "although sir analysis is certainly very important , e.g. , a minimum sir value is required for ue operation , it provides only partial insight on the achieved user rate @xcite as the latter is affected by the presence of contending ues sharing the same ap resources .",
    "a few recent works have attempted to address these issues .",
    "the random ue distribution is taken into account in @xcite , @xcite , by incorporating in the analysis the probability of an ap being inactive ( no ue present within its cell ) .",
    "however , analysis considers only the sir ( or quantities directly depended upon it ) . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the achieved user rate is computed assuming time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) , however , without taking into account the possibility of inactive aps in the system . in @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "performance under a space - division - multiple - access ( sdma ) scheme is considered without taking into account tdma effects .",
    "none of these references examines the effect of frequency - division - multiple - access ( fdma ) and either the minimum achievable rate corresponding to operating on the sir threshold is only considered , or the effect of sir outage on rate is neglected , i.e. , rates corresponding to arbitrarily small sirs are shown to be achievable with a non - zero probability .    in this paper ,",
    "the stochastic geometry framework is employed to investigate the efficiency of frequency and space dimensions for serving multiple ues . for this purpose two orthogonal multiple access schemes",
    "are considered , the first fully exploiting the available frequency dimensions with spatial dimensions having a secondary role as a means to reduce the effect of tdma ( time sharing ) , whereas the roles are reversed in the second .",
    "the performance measure of interest is the achieved user rate , taking into account the possibility of no service due to sir outage .",
    "simple , ( quasi- ) closed form expressions for the user rate distribution are derived that allow for evaluation of performance without the need of computationally intensive simulations .",
    "it is shown that performance critically depends on the choice of system parameters such as number of frequency subchannels and transmit antennas .",
    "in particular , increasing the number of available frequency dimensions alone is beneficial for users experiencing large interference , whereas increasing spatial dimensions without employing frequency dimensions degrades performance .",
    "however , best performance is achieved when both dimensions are combined in serving the users .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model with the corresponding sir and rate analysis performed in sect .",
    "iii for the class of non - cooperative multiple access schemes . in sect .",
    "iv , two simple instances of multiple access schemes are described that allow for numerical evaluation of performance , depicted in sect .",
    "v , along with discussion on the selection of system parameters .",
    "section vi concludes the paper .",
    "the downlink of an interference - limited , dense wireless network is considered .",
    "the randomly deployed over @xmath2 multiple - antenna aps are modeled as a homogeneous poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath3 with density @xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of single - antenna ues is also assumed to be a realization of another independent ppp @xmath4 with density @xmath1 .",
    "each ue is served by its closest ap resulting in non - overlapping , irregular cell shapes that form a voronoi tessellation of the space @xcite . for later reference ,",
    "the probability mass function ( pmf ) of the number of ues @xmath5 associated with a random ap in the system is given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the gamma function .",
    "note that the mean value of @xmath9 equals @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , i.e. , there is a non - zero probability of a random ap being inactive .",
    "a non - cooperative scenario is considered , where each ap independently serves its associated ues via a multiple access scheme ( to be specified later ) utilizing orthogonal time , frequency and spatial dimensions ( resources ) , so as to avoid intra - cell interference .",
    "specifically , the system bandwidth is partitioned into @xmath13 flat - fading subchannels allowing for parallel transmissions in frequency ( fdma ) .",
    "in addition , each ap is equipped with @xmath14 transmit antennas that are used to serve multiple ues within one time - frequency resource block ( sdma ) . for analytical purposes ,",
    "zero - forcing precoding is employed @xcite , with one antenna reserved for each of the @xmath15 concurrently served ues , i.e. , @xmath16 transmit antennas are active and @xmath17 antennas inactive .",
    "note that no beamforming ( diversity ) gain is considered , even when there are more available antennas than ues , in order to simplify the problem and focus attention on how efficient the spatial dimensions are in serving multiple ues .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a first attempt in describing performance when beamforming is also employed in a setting similar to this paper .",
    "all active aps transmit with the same , constant over frequency , power that is normalized to unity and allocate equal power percentage to ues served via sdma .",
    "when the number of ues served on the same subchannel can not be supported in one time - frequency resource block via sdma , time sharing is also employed ( tdma ) .",
    "note that @xmath14 and @xmath13 are system parameters that are selected offline based on criteria that will be discussed in the following .    in order to examine system performance with respect to user experience ,",
    "a typical ue is considered , located at the origin and served by its closest ap of index , say , 0 . treating interference as noise , the sir achieved on a considered subchannel is given by ( thermal noise is neglected ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distance from the serving ap , @xmath20 the path loss exponent , @xmath16 is the number of ues served by ap 0 on the specific subchannel via sdma , including the typical one ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 the channel gain from the resulting transmission link .",
    "the denominator in ( [ eq : sir ] ) represents the interference power experienced at the considered subchannel , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the distance , interference channel gain , and number of sdma - served ues of ap @xmath26 , respectively ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xmath28 denotes the indicator function which is employed to account for inactive aps on the considered subchannel , due to absence of ues in their respective cell and/or resource allocation decisions ( @xmath29 , for @xmath30 ) . considering independent identically distributed rayleigh fading links between aps and ues",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denotes the gamma probability density function ( pdf ) @xcite .",
    "note that conditioning on the existence of a typical ue does not change the distribution of the other ues in the system@xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the pmf of the number of ues associated with ap 0 _ in addition to _ the typical ue and averaged over @xmath3 is given by ( [ eq : kpmf ] ) with @xmath34 , i.e. , there is a slightly larger probability of serving more ues than any other random ap of the system .",
    "in this section , the relevant performance measures from the ( typical ) user perspective and their statistical description are examined .",
    "the interference term of ( [ eq : sir ] ) can be viewed as the result of a marked ppp @xcite , with marks @xmath35 . for the case",
    "when the marks are mutually independent given the locations of the aps , and the marginal probability density function ( pdf ) of each mark depends only on the location of its corresponding ap , the statistical characterization of the interference can be obtained by standard methods @xcite . however ,",
    "this is not the case here since @xmath36 depend on the number of ues associated with each ap which , in turn , depend on the position of all aps in the system as the latter determine the area of each cell .    as in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ,",
    "the pmf of the number of ues in a cell given the positions of all aps is approximated here by the pmf of ( [ eq : kpmf ] ) which corresponds to averaging over ap positions .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation will be examined by simulations in sect . v. under this approximation ,",
    "@xmath36 become independent of ap positions , with the corresponding marginal pmf , @xmath37 , depending , in addition to the number of ues in the cell , on the system parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , as well as the multiple access scheme ( the irrelevant index @xmath26 is dropped ) .",
    "the sir distribution can now be obtained in ( quasi- ) closed form as follows :    the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the sir , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the pmf of @xmath16 , determined by the ue distribution and the multiple access scheme , and @xmath41 is the cdf of the sir conditioned on @xmath42 additional ues co - served with the typical ue via sdma , with @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "( [ eq : f_sir ] ) is an application of the total probability theorem , whereas ( [ eq : f_sir_k0 ] ) , ( [ eq : rho ] ) are a special case of a more general recent result presented in @xcite without proof .",
    "direct derivation can be obtained by noticing that the laplace transform @xmath45 of the interference , conditioned on @xmath46 , is given by a slight modification of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) as @xmath47 and proceeding as in @xcite .    note that proposition 1 subsumes as special case the scenario considered in @xcite where @xmath48 , i.e. , @xmath14 ues are always available for transmission in every ap of the system . in this case",
    ", it can be easily seen that @xmath49 is a decreasing function of @xmath14 , mainly due to the decreased transmit power per served ue .",
    "this suggests that , at least in terms of sir performance , an sdma system may not preferable , as also stated in @xcite .",
    "however , this statement should be viewed with caution , as it assumes @xmath50 which does not hold in a dense network deployment and neglects the effect of @xmath13 and multiple access scheme which , as will be shown , may compensate for the resulting power loss due to sdma .",
    "knowledge of ( [ eq : f_sir ] ) is of importance as it provides the probability @xmath51 of a service outage due to inability of ue operation below the sir threshold @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , @xmath53 can be used to obtain cdfs of other directly related quantities of interest by transformation of variables .",
    "one such quantity employed extensively in the related literature , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , is the rate @xmath54 achieved _ per channel use _ ,",
    "i.e , on a single time - frequency resource block , given by @xmath55 examining @xmath54 is important from the viewpoint of system throughput @xcite , @xcite but provides little insight on the actual achieved user rate .",
    "note that @xmath54 is an upper bound on the actual user rate that can be achieved only when the number of ues assigned to a subchannel does not exceed @xmath14 .",
    "when this is not the case , the actual rate will necessarily be a fraction of @xmath54 due to time sharing . in an attempt to remedy this issue ,",
    "@xmath54 is divided by the number of ues sharing the subchannel in @xcite , @xcite ( case of @xmath56 is only considered ) .",
    "however , this may still be a misleading measure of performance as it does not take into account the probability of an sir outage and , therefore , provides overconfident results in the small rate region .    in order to avoid these issues , the achieved rate of a typical ue",
    "is defined in this paper as @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the number of ues , including the typical one , assigned to the considered subchannel and @xmath59 is the number of ues served via sdma in each resource block .",
    "note that ( [ eq : r ] ) implies that a registered ue in the system will be allocated part of the available resources , and thus affect the achieved rate of other ues , irrespective of being unable to decode data due to sir outage .",
    "this corresponds to the realistic assumption that system registration and signaling transmission requires a much lower sir threshold than data transmission .",
    "the following proposition holds for the rate distribution :    the cdf of @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the pmf of @xmath63 , determined by the ue distribution and the multiple access scheme , and @xmath64 is the rate cdf conditioned on @xmath65 additional ues co - served with the typical ue on the same subchannel , given by @xmath66[c]{l 's }   f_{\\textrm{sir}}(\\theta_0|m),&$r \\leq \\frac{\\overline{r}_{1,\\theta_0}m}{n k_0},$ \\\\ f_{\\textrm{sir}}\\left(2^{rnk_0/m}-1|m\\right),&$r \\geq \\frac{\\overline{r}_{1,\\theta_0}m}{nk_0},$ \\end{ieeeeqnarraybox}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is given in ( [ eq : f_sir_k0 ] ) and @xmath68 .",

    "combining ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) gives ( [ eq : f_r_k0 ] ) .",
    "note that the upper term of ( [ eq : f_r_k0 ] ) indicates that for small values of @xmath79 , rate outage probability coincides with the sir outage probability , irrespective of the actual value of @xmath79 , since it is the sir outage event ( strong interference ) that prevents ues from achieving small rates .",
    "in contrast , for larger rates , i.e. , large operational sir , performance is also limited by the effect of multiple access .",
    "the performance measures of the previous section depend on the statistics of @xmath63 , @xmath16 and @xmath80 , which , in turn , are determined by the multiple access scheme employed and the system parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in order to investigate the efficiency of frequency and spatial dimensions in serving multiple ues in an interference - limited network , two simple schemes are presented , one relying more heavily on the fdma capabilities of the system , the other on sdma",
    ". their performance will be investigated in sect .",
    "v.      this scheme fully exploits frequency dimensions by first assigning ues evenly to the available subchannels according to the following procedure ( @xmath81 is the integer floor operator ) :    define @xmath82 the set of available subchannels for allocation at any given instant .",

    "note two features of the subchannel allocation process .",
    "first , subchannel allocation is implemented in a fair but random fashion , i.e. , no channel information is taken into account , with the corresponding results serving as a lower bound on performance for a more intelligent scheme .",
    "second , only one subchannel is allocated to each ue which may lead to a reduced bandwidth utilization , i.e. , unused subchannels , in case of the number of subchannels being greater than the number of ues .",
    "this should not be viewed as a serious issue , since a ) @xmath13 is a flexible parameter that can be set to a small enough value , e.g. , @xmath88 , so as to avoid this case , if desired , and b ) presence of unused subchannels may be beneficial as it results in reduced interference .",
    "the probability of a random ap transmitting on a certain subchannel is computed in the appendix to be @xmath89 , which shows that increasing @xmath13 increases the sir since the terms @xmath90 , in ( [ eq : rho ] ) decrease accordingly .",
    "however , there exists a trade - off since , as it can be easily verified , @xmath91 for @xmath92 , i.e. , sir increase comes at a cost of smaller rate due to small bandwidth utilization per subchannel .",
    "this scheme fully exploits the spatial dimensions by first randomly constructing groups of @xmath14 ues that will be served via sdma ( note that the last constructed group may consist of less ues ) .",
    "these groups are subsequently allocated subchannels according to the same principle as scheme 1 .",
    "tdma is employed when more than one sdma groups are served by the same subchannel .",
    "typical realizations of schemes 1 and 2 are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the rationale of scheme 2 is to further reduce subchannel activity . in particular",

    "although evaluation can in principle be done analytically , the corresponding results do not provide any insight and are omitted for brevity . in any case , they can be computed relatively easily via monte carlo simulation .    in the following ,",
    "a test case scenario with @xmath101 is considered unless stated otherwise .",
    "note that this case corresponds to an average of 10 ues associated with a random ap with the probability of having more than 40 ues in a cell being practically zero .",

    "this can be explained by noting that employing more than one transmit antennas under scheme 1 does not affect interference significantly since subchannel activity remains the same .",
    "however , the reduced transmit power per ue provided by the scheme severely affects ues experiencing large interference ( lower rate region ) , whereas in the higher rate region , corresponding to ues experiencing low interference , performance benefits from reducing the time - sharing effect .",

    "clearly , employing the spatial dimensions as a means to further reduce subchannel activity is beneficial and partially compensates for the loss imposed by the transmit power reduction .",
    "however , both schemes are worse than the case of @xmath130 in the low rate region .    for the case of @xmath132 , performance of scheme 1 is not shown for clarity",

    "on the other hand , scheme 2 manages to improve performance as in the case of @xmath131 , this time even for the lower rate region .",
    "this is because the large number of subchannels alone guarantees a high operational sir and transmit power reduction due to sdma has little effect that is more than compensated by the further interference reduction scheme 2 offers .",

    "<S> this paper examines the efficiency of spatial and frequency dimensions in serving multiple users in the downlink of a small cell wireless network with randomly deployed access points . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> the stochastic geometry framework is incorporated , taking into account the user distribution within each cell and the effect of sharing the available system resources to multiple users . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of performance in terms of signal - to - interference - ratio and achieved user rate is provided that holds under the class of non - cooperative multiple access schemes . in order to obtain concrete results , </S>",
    "<S> two simple instances of multiple access schemes are considered . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that performance depends critically on both the availability of frequency and/or spatial dimensions as well as the way they are employed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , increasing the number of available frequency dimensions alone is beneficial for users experiencing large interference , whereas increasing spatial dimensions without employing frequency dimensions degrades performance . </S>",
    "<S> however , best performance is achieved when both dimensions are combined in serving the users . </S>"
