    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) was discovered@xcite almost a decade prior to some innovative experiments@xcite that brought the ratchet effect ( re ) to renewed attention .",
    "sr is a phenomenon that shows a maximum in the response of a nonlinear system to a weak ( subthreshold ) input signal of a given frequency as the strength of noise in the input signal ( or in the system ) is varied .",
    "there has been intense investigations on the subject both theoretically and experimentally and have been reviewed extensively@xcite .",
    "however , the developments have been confined mostly to _",
    "bistable systems _ ; some of the early examples include the model landau potential ( theory ) , schmitt trigger circuit , two - mode ring lasers ( experiment ) , etc@xcite .",
    "in sharp contrast , re is a phenomenon in which a net current is obtained in _ periodic potential systems _ without application of any apparent bias , albeit , again in the presence of noise or zero - mean fluctuating forces .",
    "the subject of study ( re ) since had a phenomenal growth@xcite .",
    "both the phenomena were hailed as important scientific developments with harmonious consequences@xcite .    in the beginning of the current resurgence of investigations",
    "re was put forth as an important model to explain material transport along microtubules in biological systems .",
    "there are essentially two prominent models of re ; other models can be considered as variants of these two but are important on their own right . in one of the two models ( rocked ratchet ) the mean slope of the periodic potential is changed continuously ( or abruptly ) between positive and negative values@xcite .",
    "this is the model we are interested in this work . in the other important model ( of flashing ratchets )",
    "an asymmetric periodic potential of fixed strength is switched on and off either randomly or periodically@xcite .",
    "based on the latter model , re was soon demonstrated experimentaly in a colloidal particle system@xcite .",
    "both the phenomena ( sr and re ) , however , are counterintuitive and operate under nonequilibrium conditions in presence of noise .    in order for both the phenomena of sr and re to occur in the same system",
    ", a driven periodic potential system needs to exhibit sr . as mentioned earlier the study of sr",
    "is largely confined to bistable or two - well systems .",
    "the occurrence of sr in periodic potential systems has not been conclusively proved analytically .",
    "however , some recent numerical investigations unmistakably indicate existence of sr in underdamped periodic potential systems too@xcite .",
    "this opens up the possibility of seeking both the phenomena to occur in the same system under the same conditions .",
    "the present work shows that the simultaneous occurrence of sr and ( rocked ) re is a distinct possibility even in case of underdamped symmetric periodic potential systems .",
    "it has been found earlier that sr and re occur simultaneously in an overdamped flashing ratchet where the periodic potential is considered asymmetric@xcite .",
    "as far as the present authors are aware that is the only report where re and sr are genuinely found to occur simultaneously and the two phenomena are shown to have a close relation .    in that work@xcite , the power spectrum of the cosine of the position @xmath0 for all @xmath1 gives a dominant peak at the potential switching frequency at non - zero temperatures .",
    "this peak shows a maximum at a temperature very close to where the ratchet current has the largest value .",
    "since the maximum of the power spectrum peak shows sr it was concluded that there is a close connection between sr and re .",
    "curiously , at zero temperature the power spectrum shows strong peaks at frequencies about one third ( and multiples thereof ) of the potential switching frequency .",
    "these intra-(potential)well breathings seem unrelated to switching field and disappear as the temperature is raised .",
    "in contrast , in the present work the frequency of external field is necessarily taken to be close to the natural frequency of oscillation at the bottom of the potential wells .",
    "also , we do not really find any strong evidence of a close relationship between the two phenomena .",
    "periodic potentials are almost ubiquitous and stochastic motion of particles along periodic potentials have been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "the examples include , crystals , semiconductor heterostructures , rcsj model of josephson junctions , microtubules , etc .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of optimised signal ( sr ) and material transport ( re ) together seems a very attractive possible proposition and needs to be investigated .",
    "it has been shown earlier@xcite that when an underdamped particle , subjected to temporally periodic ( sinusoidal ) field , moves in a spatially periodic ( sinusoidal ) potential , the trajectory @xmath0 of the particle shows periodic behavior at low temperatures . the amplitude of @xmath0 and its phase relationship with the exernal field @xmath2 depend on the amplitude and frequency of @xmath2 , the friction coefficient @xmath3 and also on the initial conditions of position @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 .",
    "a small range of frequencies ( @xmath6 ) of @xmath2 close to the natural frequency ( @xmath7 ) of free oscillation at the bottom of the sinusoidal potential have a remarkable influence on the nature of trajectories .    in a narrow range around @xmath8 of the period @xmath9 of @xmath2 two distinct kinds of trajectories",
    "@xmath0 are realized : one having a small phase lag @xmath10 with respect to @xmath2 and the other with a rather large @xmath10 and amplitude .",
    "these two trajectories @xmath0 genuinely have the status of dynamical states having distinct basins of attraction in the ( @xmath11 ) phase space .",
    "a particle in the in - phase ( small @xmath10 ) state usually dissipates on the average much less energy per period , @xmath12 than in the out - of - phase ( large @xmath10 ) state . for a given value of @xmath9 and the friction coefficient @xmath3 the relative abundance of the states in the ( x(0),v(0)=0 ) space over a period of the potential @xmath13 ( for example , [ @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) and",
    "also their relative stability depend on the amplitude @xmath16 of @xmath2 . for a given set of @xmath9 , @xmath3 , and @xmath16 , as the temperature",
    "is gradually increased , the relative abundance of the two dynamical states also change on the average and conspire together in such a way that the overall average energy dissipation @xmath17 shows a maximum . in the periodic potential systems @xmath17 is preferable and appropriate as a quantifier of sr over the signal to noise ratio@xcite .",
    "thus it is shown that sr is obtained in a periodic potential system but is explained in terms of transitions between the two dynamical states just as in the case of bistable systems .",
    "it may , however , be noted that in the conventional sr in double - well potential systems transition between the two states takes place at frequencies close to the kramers rate of passages between the two wells .",
    "the frequencies of the drive field @xmath2 in the bistable systems , therefore , turn out to be about a factor of @xmath18 of the frequencies used in the present study . in the present work we consider a biharmonic external field @xmath2 with the main component of frequency @xmath19 close to @xmath20 and an additional component either of frequency @xmath21 ( harmonic ) or @xmath22 ( subharmonic ) .     of various dynamical states",
    "sa , la , lah2 , lah3 and chaotic , occuring when driven by a biharmonic drive of amplitude @xmath16 , @xmath23 , the period of the main frequency component @xmath24 at @xmath25.,width=566,height=377 ]     are also plotted ( continuous line ) along with the trajectories .",
    "the corresponding stroboscopic plots are also shown on the adjacent panel as figs .",
    "2 a@xmath26 , b@xmath26 , c@xmath26 , d@xmath26 and e@xmath26 at @xmath27.,width=377,height=566 ]    as in the case of pure sinusoidal drive ( described above ) , when the underdamped particle in the sinusoidal potential is driven by a biharmonic ( harmonic or subharmonic ) field similar dynamical states are realized .",
    "however , now the states become more complex and richer . as an illustration , the @xmath28 calculated over a period @xmath9 , for @xmath29 , the fraction of the main frequency term ( @xmath30 ) ( @xmath31 is defined in the next section ) , and temperature @xmath32 , are plotted as a function of @xmath16 , the amplitude of the main frequency component of the drive in fig.1 .",
    "( all the parameters are given in dimensionless units , as described in the next section . ) for convenience ( and also to avoid the difficulty of assigning unambiguously the value of phase lag @xmath10 ) , we name the dynamical states ( based on the amplitude of trajectories ) as small - amplitude ( sa ) or large - amplitude ( la ) states instead of in - phase and out - of - phase states .    as is indicated in fig.1",
    ", we obtain three kinds of la states in the harmonic drive case : la ( with period @xmath9 ) , lah2 ( with period @xmath33 ) and lah3 ( with period @xmath34 ) .",
    "these la states are obtained in different regimes of @xmath16 and have different @xmath28 . if the value of @xmath16 is increased beyond 0.25 , the trajectories no longer remain periodic but become chaotic even at as low a temperature as .000001 .",
    "the representative trajectories , along with their stroboscopic plots , corresponding to these states are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the relative stability and hence the relative abundance of these states existing at a given temperature decide the value of @xmath17 at that temperature@xcite .",
    "the maximum shown by @xmath17 as a function of temperature indicates the occurrence of sr .",
    "however , the significance of such a peak , as a signature of sr , loses its meaning if it happens to occur at a temperature comparable to or higher than the potential barrier height itself . on the other hand",
    ", there could be situations , for example at large amplitudes of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 may peak sharply at such low temperatures that only intra-(potential)well transitions between states take place .",
    "these peaks can not be considered as an indication of occurrence of sr in a periodic potential .",
    "these restrictions make the domain of occurrence of sr in the parameter space quite narrow .",
    "however , re has a comparatively large domain of occurrence .    from fig.1",
    ", we find that there is a range of @xmath16 where the two states la and sa coexist in the harmonic drive case .",
    "this is the range of @xmath16 where sr is found to occur .",
    "as the amplitude is increased , the states lah3 also appear and one can also see peaking of @xmath17 with temperature . however , this peaking of @xmath17 can not be genuinely ascribed to sr because it takes place at a low temperature with only intra - well transitions between the states .",
    "thus , we find that sr is due to transitions between the states sa and la even in this case of biharmonic drive and the dynamical states lah3 and",
    "lah2 do not contribute to sr .",
    "in the next section , the mathematical model will be discussed .",
    "the biharmonic drive parameters will be clarified . in sec.3 the numerical method adopted and results obtained will be described in detail .",
    "finally , in sec.4 the results obtained will be discussed and conclusions of the work will be given .",
    "as usual , the motion of an underdamped particle of mass @xmath35 moving along the one dimensional spacing @xmath36 in a sinusoidal potential @xmath13 and driven by a time periodic forcing @xmath2 subjected to a gaussian thermal fluctuating force @xmath37 of mean zero is given by the langevin equation@xcite @xmath38 here , @xmath3 is the coefficient of frictional force experienced by the particle while in motion with velocity @xmath39 and is related to the fluctuating force through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xmath40    here @xmath41 is the temperature ( in energy units , @xmath42 ) of the heat bath with which the particle is in thermal contact . the potential is taken as @xmath43 and the external periodic force is considered biharmonic in nature @xmath44 in case of harmonic field , and @xmath45 in case of subharmonic field . here",
    ", @xmath31 is the fraction of the main frequency ( @xmath19 ) term and @xmath46 is the fraction of the harmonic ( subharmonic ) frequency term .",
    "@xmath2 can be rewritten , for example , as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and the ratio @xmath49 for simplicity and convenience the equations are rewritten in dimensionless units by setting @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with reduced variables denoted again now by the same symbols .",
    "thus , the langevin equation takes the form @xmath53 where the reduced potential @xmath15 .",
    "we define the effective potential @xmath54 with @xmath2 given , for example , by the equation of the same form @xmath47 for the harmonic drive , and @xmath55 for the subharmonic drive , but with the new dimensionless @xmath16 equal in magnitude to the fraction @xmath56 of the old dimensioned quantities and similarly for @xmath19 and @xmath57 , leaving , of course , the magnitude of @xmath58 same , etc@xcite .",
    "notice that , in this dimensionless form , the natural frequency @xmath20 of oscillation at the bottom of any well of the potential equals 1 , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "therefore , so long as @xmath59 we are working in the underdamped case .",
    "we keep the period @xmath9 of @xmath2 of the main frequency term such that @xmath60 appropriate for the study of sr in the sinusoidal potential .",
    "note that whatever be the values of the parameters @xmath61 , the total impulse applied on the particle over a period @xmath62 is zero . for @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for example , large forces are applied over a smaller period in one direction but small forces act over a longer period in the other direction .",
    "this kind of force profiles are known to result in ratchet effect@xcite .",
    "certain organisms , analogously , use power ( swift ) and reverse ( slower ) strokes of their flagella to aid locomotion .",
    "@xmath65 gives the same @xmath17 as @xmath63 , that is the same sr profile .",
    "both @xmath66 values will show re but they will result in opposite net current directions .",
    "in contrast to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for @xmath67 , @xmath2 has a profile like an asymmetric saw - tooth repeated periodically .",
    "here same kind of forces act in both directions but the increasing and decreasing slopes of @xmath2 are different .",
    "such @xmath2 profiles also are known to exhibit ratchet effect@xcite . in all cases friction",
    "plays an important role and so does the noise .",
    "the detailed numerical solution of the langevin equation and analysis thereof , as described in the following , brings out the essential features of sr and re in the system resulting from the biharmonic drive .",
    "we solve the langevin equation , eqn.(2.2 ) , numerically to obtain the position @xmath0 of the particle as time @xmath57 progresses .",
    "the second - order heun s method is suitably adapted@xcite to solve the langevin equation ( 2.2 ) as an initial value problem for the purpose .",
    "we choose integration - time - step size @xmath68 .",
    "we take the initial velocity @xmath69 for all cases .",
    "the initial position @xmath70 are chosen at 100 equispaced points @xmath71 between the two consecutive peaks , e.g. , [ @xmath72 .",
    "the input energy , or work done by the field on the system ( or equivalently energy dissipated by the system to the environment ) , @xmath73 , in a period @xmath9 of the external field @xmath2 , is calculated as@xcite : @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 therefore , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the magnitude of the area of the hysteresis loop @xmath79 .",
    "the average input energy per period , @xmath28 , averaged over an entire trajectory spanning @xmath80 periods of @xmath2 , is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the area of the mean hysteresis loop @xmath83 . in our calculation , typically , we solve eqn .",
    "( 2.2 ) for @xmath84 periods of @xmath2 for each initial condition @xmath4 and take an ensemble average over all initial conditions to obtain @xmath85 and @xmath17 .",
    "the ratchet current or the mean velocity @xmath86 is calculated by dividing the mean distance travelled by the total run time .    before we proceed to investigate the effect of biharmonic field on the occurrence of sr and re it will be quite educative to see the effect of the frequency @xmath87 of the pure sinusoidal drive .",
    "as has been indicated earlier , a pure sinusoidal drive can not yield re in a symmetric sinusoidal potential system .",
    "we , therefore , study the occurrence of the two dynamical states la and sa which are responsible for sr and find the domain in the parameter space of ( @xmath88 ) where la and sa occur simultaneously .",
    "plane of the fractions ( fsa= 0 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.95 , and 1.0 ) of sa states in the coexistence region of the states sa and la when the system is driven by a sinusoidal field of period @xmath9 and amplitude @xmath89 in a medium of uniform friction @xmath3 .",
    "the inset shows the variation of fsa as @xmath9 is varied for @xmath90 .",
    "it shows a large discontinuous jump of 0.215 ( from @xmath91 ) at @xmath92 and a very gradual and slow approach to fsa=1 at large @xmath9 values.,width=566,height=377 ]    we restrict our study to the amplitude @xmath93 of the external field @xmath94 at @xmath32 for the occurrence of the states la and sa .",
    "note that , in the pure sinusoidal drive case , we set @xmath95 . as mentioned earlier , we determine the nature of states ( la or sa ) by looking at the particle trajectories for 100 uniformly distributed initial positions @xmath4 drawn from inside of one period of the sinusoidal potential .",
    "3 shows the diagram of existence of la and sa states in the ( @xmath88 ) plane . for a given @xmath3",
    "we find only la state for small @xmath9 values .",
    "as @xmath9 is increased at a certain value of @xmath9 sa too begins appearing .",
    "this @xmath9 sets the boundary between regions of existence of pure la states and the simultaneous occurrence of both sa and la states .",
    "on further increase of @xmath9 the fraction of la states decreases ( and concurrently the fraction of sa states increases ) and at a certain value of @xmath9 the fraction of la states becomes zero for the first time .",
    "this value of @xmath9 sets the boundary between region of existence of the pure sa states and the region of coexisting states of la and sa . together with these extreme boundary lines of fractions 0 and 1 of the sa states are also plotted the locii of fractions .3 , .4 , .5 , .6 , and .95 of sa . as can be seen from the figure there is a large space between the locus of fraction .95 of sa and the boundary where la disappears .",
    "this is because for certain small number of initial positions @xmath4 the la states continue to exist even for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "this is particularly noticeable around @xmath96 .",
    "however , as explained below , the states appearing in this subspace do not make any significant impact on our study of sr .    in the inset of fig .",
    "3 are plotted the fractions ( fsa ) of states sa as @xmath9 is varied .",
    "the inset shows that the appearance of sa is very rapid and 100 percent la boundary stays close to @xmath97 .",
    "however , the disappearance of la is very slow and gradual and la ( together with sa ) continues till a value of @xmath9 as large as 14 .",
    "it also shows that there is a small range of @xmath9 , close to @xmath97 , where both the states exist in significant fractions . as will be clear in the following this remark has important bearing on sr for the biharmonic drive .",
    "now , as the temperature ( noise strength ) is increased from this small value transitions take place between the states sa and la . consequently , the average input energy @xmath98 changes as the temperature is varied .     ( a ) and amplitudes @xmath99 ( b ) of the trajectories as a function of period @xmath9 of the drive for various values of @xmath3 .",
    "we obtain two branches , for each @xmath3 , one correspond to sa and the other to la . for each @xmath3",
    "there is a region ( the coexistence region ) of @xmath9 where both sa and la appear but in separate branches .",
    "the inset shows that there is only one single continuous branch for @xmath100.,width=453,height=453 ]    before we proceed to study sr it will be quite appropriate to appreciate the nature of these states sa and la .",
    "these states make their appearance at @xmath101 and persist to temperatures @xmath41 much smaller than the potential barrier height of maximum 2 and driven by a subthreshold field of amplitude @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "4a we plot the phase lags @xmath10 between these states of mean trajectories @xmath103 and the drive field @xmath2 and in fig .",
    "4b , their amplitudes @xmath104 are plotted as @xmath105 is varied .",
    "we notice that both @xmath10 and @xmath104 change continuously as @xmath9 is varied for both the states for @xmath3 values ranging from .07 to 0.16 .",
    "the curves for sa and la are clearly separated .",
    "the nature of variation of the curve for la ( sa ) is just a continuation even at the boundaries where sa ( la ) makes its appearance for the first time .",
    "a state , thus , either exists or does not exist at all and not that a state emerges out of the other state as @xmath9 is varied .",
    "it is clearly not a case of bifurcation at the boundary ; these states have their independent identities .",
    "bifurcations and associated chaos occur only at large @xmath16 values@xcite . for @xmath106 , however , we get just one kind of trajectory whose @xmath10 and @xmath104 change continuously as @xmath9 is varied in the entire range ( insets of figs .",
    "4 ) . one can not identify from the graph to call the trajectories sa or la for @xmath106 .     versus @xmath10 ( a ) and @xmath107 versus @xmath99 ( b ) .",
    "the thick line shows the boundary of the coexistence region of sa and la .",
    "we have the sa and la branches outside the coexistence region of various @xmath3 values.,width=453,height=453 ]    in order to gain a little more insight into the dynamical states and their coexistence , the figs . 4a and 4b are redrawn in figs . 5a and 5b . in fig . 5a",
    "the frequency ( @xmath108 ) of @xmath2 is plotted against @xmath10 and in 5b the frequency is plotted against the amplitude @xmath104 of the trajectories @xmath0 for various constant @xmath3 values .",
    "the boundary of the region of coexistence of the two states is shown prominently leaving the region itself blank .",
    "the blank bounded region separates the two regions of occurrence of pure la and sa states .",
    "an analogy may be drawn with the liquid - gas pressure - density phase diagram with the isothermals replaced by the constant @xmath3 curves of figs .",
    "the sa states ( phases ) , of course , run close to the boundary . in the liquid - gas case",
    "the mass of the system is conserved whereas in this case the total number of ( la+sa ) states remains constant .",
    "the curve with @xmath109 has a clear analogy with an isotherm above the critical point in the liquid - gas case .",
    "however , there are shortcomings too . for instance",
    ", a constant @xmath3 curve ends at the boundary on the la side at a different frequency @xmath107 from the @xmath107 where the curve emerges out of the boundary on the sa side . also , the boundary on the sa side has a curious unbounded upturn for all @xmath110 .",
    "this peculiarity comes about because @xmath9 decreases along the sa side boundary as @xmath3 is reduced from @xmath96 in fig.3 .",
    "an another computational shortcoming in fig .",

    "is plotted as a function of temperature @xmath41 for various values of the period @xmath9 of @xmath2 , for @xmath111 and @xmath90 .",
    "the curves are qualitatively separated into 3 groups corresponding to small , intermediate and large @xmath9 values .",
    "the upper inset shows the variation of @xmath17 for smaller @xmath9 , indicating that there is no appreciable dip at low temperatures .",
    "the lower inset is a condensed version of large @xmath9 curves , showing the @xmath17 peaks at large temperature @xmath112 .",

    "6 shows the variation of @xmath98 as a function of temperature for @xmath96 for a range of values of the period @xmath9 of the drive field .",
    "though @xmath98 shows peaking behaviour in all the graphs , these graphs can be classified into three qualitatively distinct groups .",
    "the three groups of @xmath9 can be identified by a careful look at the insets of fig .",
    "6 . for the group of graphs corresponding to the small @xmath9 values",
    "@xmath98 peaks at very small @xmath41 . at such small @xmath41",
    "only intra - well transitions take place between sa and la and no inter - well transitions are possible . thus ,",
    "as remarked in the introduction , this peaking of @xmath98 can not actually be termed as sr in a periodic potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the graphs corresponding to the large @xmath9 values show a broad peak .",
    "they peak at temperatures @xmath113 . in this case",
    ", the peaking temperature is too large for the peak to be considered as a sensible sr .",
    "the graphs corresponding to the intermediate @xmath9 show the nature of typical sr with appreciably large inter - well transitions at the peak of @xmath98 and a characteristic initial dip .",
    "this dip indicates that sa states are more stable than la states for these parameter values .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that reasonable sr can be obtained in quite a narrow range of @xmath9 where the fraction of sa lies roughly between .3 and .7 at low temperatures .",
    "this range lies near about @xmath114 for almost all values of @xmath3 between 0.07 and 0.16 , fig.3 .      from the above discussion it follows that physically reasonable sr",
    "can be obtained only for values of @xmath9 around 8 , for this is the region where the two dynamical states occur in comparable fractions .",
    "we , therefore , consider a biharmonic drive with the main frequency close to @xmath115 . henceforth , we take the period of the main component of the drive to be 8 unless otherwise stated .",
    "therefore , in the case of biharmonic drive the harmonic component has the period of 4 and that of the subharmonic component a period of 16 .",
    "both these periods are far away from the range of periods where sa and la occur in comparable fractions .",
    "therefore , neither the harmonic component nor the subharmonic component alone is expected to contribute directly to the occurrence of sr .",
    "but their presence in the biharmonic ( harmonic and subharmonic ) drive case has considerable influence on the occurrence of sr and re .",
    "the presence of the harmonic component enhances the crest(trough ) and distorts the ( trough ) ( crest ) of the main component .",
    "nevertheless , the main component ( @xmath116 ) , being the fundamental component , is always reinforced by the harmonic component .",
    "therefore , one would expect sr to occur almost throughout the range of @xmath31 except at close to @xmath117 .",
    "the subharmonic component , in this case being the fundamental component , successively enhances and reduces the alternate peaks ( troughs ) of the main component of @xmath2 depending on the phase @xmath66 .",
    "however , appreciable peaks at the period of the main component appears only for large @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , one does not expect sr to occur at smaller values of @xmath31 .",
    "however , one can expect re , even if feeble , to occur throughout the range of @xmath31 except at @xmath119 for both harmonic and subharmonic drive cases",
    ".    intuitively thinking , the ratchet current @xmath86 should decrease if dissipation of energy of the system @xmath17 increases given a drive field .",
    "this is what usually happens at large temperatures where both energy dissipation and ratchet current vary monotonically and @xmath86 does not show current reversal .",
    "however , we are interested in studying the occurrence of both sr and re simultaneously .",
    "we may , therefore , also witness increasing ratchet current with increasing dissipation .       lying between -0.5 and 1.5 , ie . within a full one period of the potential for the initial phase @xmath66 of @xmath2 ; @xmath63 ( a ) and @xmath65 ( b ) , for @xmath120 and @xmath90 at @xmath25 , and @xmath114.,width=566,height=377 ]     and @xmath121 , @xmath24 , @xmath90 at @xmath25 .",

    "the occurrence of both sr ( fig .",
    "9a ) and re ( fig .",
    "9b ) is evident",
    ". however , sr and the maximum of ratchet current @xmath86 occur at widely separated temperatures ( inset of fig .",
    "thus , the simultaneous occurrence of sr and re is beyond dispute , though their connection is not clear .",
    "it is to be noted that the effective amplitude @xmath134 for @xmath93 and @xmath30 of the harmonic drive , eq.(2.4 ) , is 1.0 .",
    "the amplitude is just at the threshold value making the potential barrier disappear momentarily every period in one direction whereas the barrier remains finite in the other direction throughout the period . for @xmath93 and @xmath135",
    "the potential barrier disappears for a finite interval of @xmath57 in a period whereas for @xmath93 and @xmath136 the barrier always remains finite but unequal in the two directions . in either case",
    "this favours an asymmetric net particle motion with the assistance of fluctuating forces , but with no net impulse applied , resulting in re .",
    "the presence of the harmonic component of @xmath2 induces re but , as explained earlier , it has only a supporting role to play for the occurrence of sr .",
    "the inset ( ii ) of fig .",
    "9b shows that the ratchet current rises fast as the fraction of the main component @xmath31 of @xmath2 is decreased .",
    "this is because we have kept the parameter @xmath16 fixed at .2 for various @xmath31 values .",
    "however , decreasing @xmath31 corresponds to increasing @xmath137 which also increases the effective amplitude @xmath138 ( eqn .",
    "( 2.7 ) ) and hence @xmath86 . the variation is particularly steep for @xmath135 because @xmath139 and hence the potential barrier disappears for a finite fraction of the period of @xmath2 in one direction whereas the barrier remains large in the other direction .",

    "10 shows the variation of @xmath86 as a function of @xmath31 for a fixed value of @xmath144 for @xmath145 and .2 .",
    "the variation is as it should be because @xmath117 and 1 correspond to pure sinusoidal drive and hence there is no asymmetry in the system for a preferred direction , either to the right or to the left , of flow ; @xmath86 must be zero at these two extreme values of @xmath31 and nonzero at the intermediate values .",

    "we have plotted @xmath17 , in the inset , for the same parameter values . only at large @xmath31 values @xmath17 and @xmath86 vary such that one increases while the other decreases . but at or near the regions of occurrence of sr dissipation @xmath17 and the current @xmath86 vary in the same way , at least for a part of the range of @xmath31 values .",

    ". these trajectories , again , are of two kinds representing the two dynamical states sa2 and la2 in place of sa and la , respectively , of the harmonic drive case . though the period of trajectories corresponging to the states sa2 and la2",

    "the subharmonic component with frequency @xmath162 of the drive , however , helps in obtaining re .",

    "figure 12 provides a rough guideline for the proper choice of @xmath9 for various values of @xmath31 for @xmath102 .",
    "so far a sort of thumb rule has emerged that the best region in the parameter space where sr can usually be obtained is where the two dynamical states appear roughly in the same ratio ( with a tolerance of less than 20 per cent ) at low temperatures .",
    "the curves at the lower end of @xmath31 is abruptly ended because one of the dynamical states , namely la2 , disappears for all @xmath31 less than the edge of @xmath31 in the graphs .",
    "we explore the occurrence of sr and re in the region of parameter space where the occurrence of sa2 is around 50 per cent . in fig .",
    "13 , we plot @xmath17 ( a ) and @xmath86 ( b ) as a function of temperature @xmath41 for @xmath102 , @xmath114 and @xmath163 , and .8 . for @xmath164 no reasonable sr could be obtained though @xmath86 becomes large . for @xmath165",
    ", @xmath86 becomes too small .",
    "interestingly , the inset of fig . 13a summarizes the result showing that @xmath17 and @xmath86 both peak at temperatures lying in a range between .2 and .25 , though not exactly at the same temperature .    in figs .",
    "14a and 14b , respectively , show the variation of @xmath17 and @xmath86 with temperature for @xmath102 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 and 8.2 .",
    "one can observe that @xmath17 peak at temperatures ranging between .1 and .4 whereas @xmath86 peak in a narrow range lying between .25 and .3 .",
    "therefore for a specific @xmath9 both will peak at the same t value",
    ". however , this will only be a happy coincidence and not a general rule that both show peaking behaviour at the same temperatue or in a close range .",
    "we again plot @xmath17 and @xmath86 as a function of temperature , respectively , in figs .",
    "15a and 15b for @xmath166 , @xmath114 but now @xmath168 and .22 .",
    "the peaks of @xmath17 lie between @xmath169 and .1 .",
    "the peak for @xmath170 is larger and sharper occurring at @xmath171 we obtain a well defined sr for @xmath170 .",
    "it is to be noted that for @xmath170 there was no sr in case of harmonic drive .",
    "the upper @xmath16 limit for the occurrence of sr is thus extended to a larger value in the subharmonic drive case .",
    "the @xmath86 peaks are very broad for smaller @xmath16 values .",
    "it is very ambiguous to pinpoint the temperature at which @xmath86 peaks , though there is a clear indication that the peaks lie between @xmath172 and .1 .",
    "that is , the peak temperatures of @xmath17 and @xmath86 tend to converge for larger @xmath16 values towards 0.1 .",
    "we do not plot the graphs for @xmath173 because @xmath86 show relatively broader ( almost flat ) peak with much smaller heights .",
    "the results of the calculations show that sr and re do occur in the same region of parameter space but a strong connection between the two phenomena is not conclusive .",
    ") and backward ( for @xmath174 ) with the same magnitude of constant average slope for @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the trajectory is actually periodically jerky as seen from the inset.,width=566,height=377 ]    the diagram in fig .",
    "3 closes at around @xmath109 indicating that la and sa do not have separate identity for @xmath106 .",
    "however , the diagram is left open on the lower side of @xmath3 at @xmath177 .",
    "this is partly because of practical difficulty in clearly demarcating the regions of existence of the two states . and",
    "partly also because the system s behaviour becomes very complex at low values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , for @xmath178 and some initial @xmath4 the trajectory of the particle becomes constantly ( but periodically jerky ) forward moving with a constant mean slope , fig .",
    "but for some other @xmath4 the trajectory becomes backward moving with the same magnitude of slope .",
    "note that the system is perfectly ( right - left ) symmetric and therefore these net transport giving trajectories can only be described as strange . however , when the total displacement is averaged over all the initial @xmath4 values we get zero mean displacement as it should be for a pure sinusoidal drive .",
    "the states lah3 and lah2 shown in fig",
    ". 1 for the biharmonic drive at close to @xmath101 are , in fact , unstable against thermal fluctuations . as the temperature is raised from @xmath25 , by a small amount transitions",
    "takes place from these states to the la state .",
    "this small raise in temperature is much smaller than the typical temperatures where @xmath98 peak .",
    "therefore , one can expect @xmath98 to peak till @xmath179 due to the transition of sa to la ( not lah3 ) .",
    "for the small range @xmath180 only lah3 and la appear at the lowest temperature .",
    "as the temperature is raised lah3 states quickly go over to la states giving a small peak of @xmath98 .",
    "however , this is at a very low temperature where only intra - well thermal transitions are possible .",
    "therefore , no genuine sr occurs in this range of parameter space .",
    "for @xmath181 the only state lah2 existing at the lowest temperature also promptly goes over to la as the temperature is raised by a little .",
    ", in fact , indicates that lah2 , as far as the @xmath124 is concerned , is just a continuation of la . from this maximum possible value @xmath98",
    "can only have a monotonic decrease because the trajectories become chaotic as the temperature is raised further .",
    "this can also be inferred from the observation that for a part of the period , @xmath182 because the amplitude @xmath183 for all @xmath184 and @xmath30 .",
    "the sharp decrease of energy dissipation @xmath124 for the chaotic trajectories at large @xmath16 values appears surprising .",
    "however , the decrease can be understood if the trajectories are studied carefully . in the usual situations energy",
    "is absorbed from the external field if the particle moves against the force .",
    "however , energy absorption becomes negative if particle moves in the direction of the force . in the case of chaotic trajectories",
    "the latter situation becomes quite common and hence the decrease of energy absorbed from the field at large values of @xmath16 and also at large temperatures .    in fig .",
    "5a , the constant @xmath3 curves appear to be intruding into the coexistence region on the sa side .",
    "that is only because of our compuational inadequacies in pinpointing the coexistence boundary .",
    "the la states disappear gradually and very slowly . moreover",
    ", the appearance of states ( la or sa ) depend very sensitively on the initial condition ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we take at most 200 discrete values of the positions within a period of the potential .",
    "this can not be considered as a continuous scanning .",
    "there is every possibility of missing an la state and set the boundary before we have actually reached there ( fsa=1.0 , for the first time ) .",
    "the @xmath186 curve should really be grazing close along the actual boundary .",
    "the correspondence with the liquid - gas phase diagram is reasonable .",
    "finally , to summarise in conclusion , the occurrence of sr in a periodic potential when driven by a biharmonic field of appropriate frequency is shown to be possible .",
    "the parameter range in which sr occurs is quite narrow but finite .",
    "re too occurs in this range as it does outside of it .",
    "thus , sr and re do occur in the same parameter space .",
    "however , the peak of @xmath98 and the maximum ratchet current occur at temperatures widely separated from each other in the harmonic drive case . in the subharmonic drive case",
    ", however , there can be found exceptional circumstances where the maxima of the two quantites may occur at the same temperature .",
    "but these are mere coincidences .",
    "the occurrence of the two phenomena at the same parameter range can allow for efficient material transport at optimum tempratures at certain frequencies of field drive in periodic potential systems .",
    "however , at that optimum tempearture particle current need not be a maximum .",
