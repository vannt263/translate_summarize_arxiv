    "cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 is one of the best characterized heavy - fermion ( hf ) compounds@xcite exhibiting a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) between a paramagnetic phase with full kondo screening of the ce 4f moments and an antiferromagnetic phase induced by their rkky coupling .",
    "@xcite the qpt occurs at a critical au concentration of @xmath8 .",
    "two major scenarios for the qpt have been put forward , firstly the hertz - millis scenario@xcite where only the ( bosonic ) magnetic fluctuations become critical , leaving the ( fermionic ) heavy quasiparticles intact , and secondly the local quantum criticality@xcite where the local kondo quasiparticles are destroyed by coupling to the quantum critical magnetic fluctuations . in the latter case",
    "the kondo screening scale , or kondo temperature of the lattice system , @xmath9 , vanishes at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) . despite intense efforts it has not been possible to unambiguously identify either one scenario in cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 .",
    "the difficulty resides in the fact that near the qcp many different effects come into play , including local kondo screening , lattice coherence and fermi volume collapse , quantum critical fluctuations , and possible dimensional reduction.@xcite they have prevented a conclusive experimental picture as well as a unified theory of the qpt .",
    "recently we have presented direct measurements of the evolution of the local kondo screening energy scale @xmath2 across the qcp as extracted from high - resolution ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups).@xcite taking impurity spectra clearly above @xmath2 as well as above the lattice coherence temperature @xmath10 and the nel temperature for magnetic ordering , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , made it possible to probe the local energy scale without the complications caused by lattice coherence or quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "the surprising outcome of these investigations is that the precursors of the qpt are already visible in the single - impurity @xmath2 as extracted from ups spectra at such elevated temperatures . in ref .",
    "[ ] we developed a theory , based on the effective single - impurity model realized for temperatures @xmath13 , where the kondo exchange coupling @xmath14 of a ce site is selfconsistently renormalized by the surrounding , identical ce atoms only through the indirect rkky coupling .",
    "the theory explains the observed , nontrivial , steplike behavior of @xmath2 near the qcp and supports the local critical scenario for cecu@xmath0au@xmath1",
    ". it also provides a general criterion to distinguish experimentally whether a given hf compound should exhibit hm or local quantum critical behaviour.@xcite    ups provides the most direct access to the screening scale @xmath2 by directly recording the kondo resonance in the local ce @xmath15 spectrum,@xcite but probes a relatively shallow surface region only .",
    "therefore we complement here the studies of ref .  [ ] with bulk - sensitive x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) on the same samples and under the same experimental conditions , even though xps provides only rather indirect information about the ce @xmath15 spectrum and the physics near the fermi energy @xmath16.@xcite we find that the xps results are in full agreement with the ups analysis .",
    "before we show the experimental results , we briefly recall the energetics of the photoionization process , in order to understand the essential structure of the xps spectra . in xps the ce @xmath17 spectrum is recorded in the final state of the ce ion after creation of a @xmath17 core hole .",
    "the binding energy of a @xmath17 electron is influenced by the electrostatic attraction @xmath18 between the @xmath17 core hole and a @xmath15 electron and , hence , depends on the number of electrons @xmath19 in the @xmath15 shell .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 peak of the xps spectrum is split into individual resonances , each one corresponding to a different charge state of the @xmath15 shell , the so - called @xmath20 resonances , with @xmath21 . in addition",
    ", there is a coulomb repulsion @xmath22 between two electrons in the @xmath15 shell . the peak position ( binding energy @xmath23 ) of the @xmath20 resonance is the energy difference between the charge configuration in the photoionized final state and in the groundstate .",
    "hence , it is roughly given by , up to conduction electron screening corrections , @xmath24 note that the attractive core hole potential @xmath18 changes the whole level scheme.@xcite in particular , in the photoionized state the @xmath25 configuration becomes occupied ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] ) , even though in the ce groundstate it is shifted far above the fermi energy by the repulsion @xmath22 .",
    "the quantitative fit of @xmath6 and @xmath22 ( see below ) shows that the binding energy of the @xmath26 configuration , @xmath27 , is the largest .",
    "the spectral weight of the @xmath28 xps peak is proportional to the kondo resonance of the ce @xmath15 spectrum , since in cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 most of the kondo peak weight is located above @xmath16@xcite and thus represents the unoccupied configuration of the @xmath15 shell .",
    "all the measurements were carried out at @xmath30  k and thus at temperatures far above any long - range or quantum critical fluctuations .",
    "the experimental setup is equipped with a scienta r4000 analyser and a monochromatized x - ray source ( al k@xmath31 line : x - ray enery @xmath32  ev ) .",
    "the pressure in the uhv chamber was @xmath33  mbar . because of the low intensity due to the small surface area of the crytals and the rapid detoriation of the surface , the instrumental resolution was set to @xmath34  ev in order to optimize the count rate .",
    "the investigated samples were single crystals grown in a w crucible under high - purity ar atmosphere @xcite and cleaved _ in situ _ at the sample position just before the measurement .",
    "core - level spectra of cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 for five differnet au concentrations at @xmath30  k ( x - ray energy @xmath35  ev , experimental resolution @xmath36  ev ) .",
    "the vertical lines mark the peak positions exhibiting an abrupt shift of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 resonances from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig : stack ] ]    the ce @xmath17 core - level spectra for all measured compounds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] . taking the second derivative of each spectrum",
    "reveals that each of the broad peaks is actually comprised of two resonances .",
    "hence , each spectrum consists of a group of three resonances , termed @xmath28 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] .",
    "they are , in addition , duplicated due to a spin - orbit splitting of @xmath41  ev .",
    "a rough analysis already shows that the xps @xmath17 spectra can be divided into two classes , namely for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , like in the case of the ups @xmath15 spectra : @xcite for @xmath42 the @xmath28 peak at @xmath44  ev is clearly visible , albeit comparatively weak , while for @xmath43 the @xmath28 weight is almost not discernible and vanishes completely for @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , for @xmath43 the @xmath37 and @xmath38 peaks are shifted by a constant amount of 1.8  ev towards smaller binding energy relative to their positions for @xmath42 .    ]",
    "in order to interpret these xps results quantitatively , we calculated the ce @xmath17 spectra using the gunnarson  schnhammer ( gs ) theory,@xcite which is based on the single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) . from earlier ups experiments it is known@xcite",
    "that the cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 @xmath15 spectra and their @xmath46 dependence are very well described in the framework of this model for elevated temperatures @xmath47 , with an rkky - induced renormalization of the local kondo coupling.@xcite moreover , the gs theory has been successfully applied to interpret xps , x - ray photoabsorption , inverse photoemission and valence photoemission spectroscopy on other ce - based compounds , using the same parameter set for all measurements,@xcite albeit small adjustments of parameter values were pointed out to be necessary in some cases.@xcite in our gs calculations for cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 we use , without fitting , the same parameter values of the siam that were determined earlier from noncrossing approximation ( nca ) calculations of the ups @xmath15 spectra of the same compounds.@xcite that is , the conduction band half width and the bare @xmath15 level are @xmath48  ev and @xmath49  ev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15-level hybridization had been determined as @xmath50  mev for @xmath51 and @xmath52  mev for @xmath53 , corresponging to a reduction of the effective spin exchange coupling @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "the xps @xmath17 spectra involve the additional interaction parameters @xmath6 and @xmath22 , see above .",
    "since the intra-@xmath15-level repulsion @xmath22 will not significantly depend on the au concentration @xmath3 , we have chosen a constant value of @xmath55  ev  @xmath56 ( within nca it was assumed to be infinite for simplicity , in order to suppress @xmath15 double occupancy ) .",
    "this leaves the core hole potential @xmath6 as the only adjustable parameter .",
    "it determines the final - state energy levels and thus the position of the core - level peaks relative to each other according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eb ] ) . to fit the theoretical spectra to the experimental results we added to the gs",
    "spectra a background , accounting phenomenologically for inelastic scattering of the electrons during the xps process , and convoluted the theoretical spectra with a gaussian , accounting for the experimental resolution .",
    "the fits yield @xmath57  ev for @xmath42 and @xmath58  ev for @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig : vgl ] shows the gs spectra , fitted to the experimental data , and the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] shows a comparisson of the unbroadened gs spectra below and above @xmath59 .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkable : both , the relative peak intensities and the shape of the spectra are well reproduced by only a single fit parameter .",
    "-configuration as determined from the gs fit .",
    "it represents a measure of the weight of the kondo - resonance in the @xmath15 spectrum ( see text ) .",
    "the upper right panel shows the @xmath15-occupation numbers . in the lower panel",
    "the calculated , unbroadened gs spectra are shown for cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 compounds below and above the quantum critical concentration @xmath59 .",
    "the parameter values used in the calculations are given in the text .",
    "the vertical lines mark the @xmath28 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 peaks and the so - shifting for @xmath60 . [ fig : nf ] ]    this allows for a detailed interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "a reduction of @xmath61 leads to a significant change in the relative weights of the peaks , as already shown by gunnarsson and schnhammer in refs .",
    "[ ] : for @xmath62  mev the @xmath38-peak is diminished and the @xmath28-peak has almost vanished . since the weight of the @xmath28-configuration is a measure of the weigth of the kondo resonance ( see above ) , this means for the present cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 system that the spectral weight of the kondo resonance drops abruptly as @xmath3 is changed from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , in full agreement with the findings of ups in ref .",
    "[ ] . in the left upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] we show the weight of the @xmath28-configuration as extracted from the gs calculations for different @xmath3 .",
    "it shows a significant step at @xmath65 . as a consequence of this collapse of the kondo resonance in the @xmath15 spectrum above the fermi level",
    ", one expects that the spectral weight below @xmath16 and , hence , the @xmath4-level occupation number @xmath5 are increased for @xmath64 by roughly the kondo spectral weight . as an immediate , further consequence",
    "the @xmath17 electron binding energy should decrease , because the enhancement of @xmath5 increases the attractive interaction exerted by the @xmath15 electrons on the @xmath17 core hole .",
    "both expectations can be checked from the xps spectra .",
    "firstly , the decrease of @xmath17 binding energy is indeed seen in the experimental spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stack ] ) and in the fitted theoretical spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] , lower panel ) as the upward shift of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 peaks for @xmath53 as compared to @xmath51 .",
    "it is also reflected by the increase of the fitted values of the effective core level potential @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , the probability for the @xmath15 occupancy in the groundstate can be extracted from the xps spectra.@xcite it is roughly given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ( unnormalized ) spectral weight of the @xmath20 peak , @xmath21 , after substraction of the inelastic background .",
    "determining @xmath5 directly from the experimental data is not accurate , since the @xmath20-peaks overlap and the determination of the inelastic background of the experimental spectra is not trivial .",
    "instead we extract the @xmath5-numbers from the fitted gs calculations .",
    "these include also small deviations from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nf ] ) which arise from the dynamics of the xps process.@xcite in the right upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nf ] we compare the @xmath5 values obtained from the gs calculations and from nca calculations of ref .  .",
    "since @xmath5 increases with temperature,@xcite it is important to note that the nca values have been calculated at the experimental temperature of @xmath30  k. although the absolute values of @xmath5 differ for the two calculations  probably due to the use of a infinite @xmath22 within nca  the main features are the same : both data sets exhibit a significant , abrupt step of @xmath5 at the critical concentration @xmath59 for the qpt in cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 , as expected from the kondo resonance collapse observed for @xmath68 .",
    "we have presented data from xps - measurements at elevated temperature on cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 compounds with five different au concentrations @xmath3 across the critical concentration @xmath7 of the magnetic quantum phase transition . with increasing @xmath3 the @xmath17 core spectra exhibit near @xmath65 an abrupt change with respect to three different features , namely ( 1 ) a collapse of the @xmath28 resonance , signalling a sudden decrease of kondo screening , ( 2 ) a step - like increase of the @xmath15 occupation number and ( 3 ) a sudden increase of the core hole attraction , evidenced by a shift of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 peaks towards smaller binding energy .",
    "the first feature is in complete agreement with findings of direct ups measurements of the kondo resonance in the ce @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "the features ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are explained in a natural way as direct consequences of the kondo resonance collapse .",
    "therefore , the present measurements strongly support that the kondo resonance collapse observed at the qpt by ups @xcite is not a surface effect but an effect of the bulk cecu@xmath0au@xmath1 compounds , since it is seen by the bulk - sensitive xps as well .",
    "the analysis of the spectra using the gunnarson - schnhammer theory@xcite , supported by nca calculations , further indicates that the spectra taken at temperatures above the single - impurity kondo temperature @xmath2 and above the lattice coherence and nel temperatures @xmath10 , @xmath69 are well described by the single - impurity anderson model , with the spin exchange coupling @xmath14 renormalized only by rkky interactions with the surrounding ce impurity moments.@xcite thus , our results indicate experimentally that the hm model@xcite is insufficient to describe the qpt in cecu@xmath0au@xmath29 and that at the lowest temperatures the system should follow the local quantum critical scenario,@xcite as argued in detail in ref .  .",
