    "real - time dynamics of quantum fields plays an important role in the early universe , in heavy ion collisions and in condensed matter .",
    "for example , a detailed understanding of the rate of sphaleron transitions at high temperature is relevant for baryogenesis .",
    "this is a non - perturbative problem , which should be treated preferably directly in real - time .",
    "however , as is usually the case , in order to do actual calculations , approximations have to be made .",
    "the classical approximation @xcite is based on the observation that at sufficiently high temperature the relevant long distance modes in the quantum theory behave classically .",
    "hence it makes sense to study the classical equations of motion .",
    "the advantage is that it is ( almost ) straightforward to implement it numerically , and that e.g. sphaleron transitions are easy to find .",
    "however , it has become clear that hard thermal loop ( htl ) effects play an important role , and that it is necessary to incorporate them in a classical field and/or classical particle approach @xcite .",
    "other possibilities are large @xmath2 or hartree approximations @xcite , which have been applied to e.g. ( inflationary ) scalar models and gauge theories . in this formulation",
    "the fields are split in a classical part and a quantum field , and they are coupled via semiclassical equations of motion , which are exact in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the advantage is that quantum effects , including the backreaction on the classical fields , are taken into account .",
    "however , in actual numerical calculations , the emphasis has been on the case of homogeneous classical fields @xcite .",
    "this excludes inhomogeneous classical field configurations , such as the sphaleron .    since we want to improve both the classical approximation by including quantum effects ( such as htl s in @xmath4 dimensions ) and the large @xmath2 approach by relaxing the classical field being homogeneous , we consider here the second approach with inhomogeneous classical fields .    after a discussion of the model",
    ", we describe the effective equations of motion .",
    "they are defined on a lattice in space and time , to have gauge invariance and numerical stability .",
    "we illustrate this with some numerical results .",
    "we consider the abelian higgs model in @xmath0 dimensions , with axially coupled fermions . the ( continuum )",
    "action is s = -d^2 x . & & it has a number of properties in common with the standard model . the bosonic vacuum is non - trivial , and is labeled with the chern - simons number @xmath5 , being integer at a vacuum .",
    "the vacua are separated by a finite energy sphaleron barrier , where @xmath6 is half integer .",
    "there is a global vector symmetry , @xmath7 , which leads to a classically conserved vector current @xmath8 .",
    "however , the corresponding charge , the fermion number @xmath9 , is not conserved in the quantum theory , because of the anomaly : @xmath10 . the bosonic part of this model has been used before to test the classical approximation @xcite",
    "being in @xmath0 dimensions has a few consequenses .",
    "the typical htl expressions are subdominant , so that these play a less important role @xcite .",
    "also the divergences are less severe , only the higgs self energy is divergent , and only due to higgs and fermion one loop contributions . and it is much easier to deal with numerically than @xmath4 dimensional models .",
    "in order to formulate the model on a lattice , it is convenient to first put the model in a more suitable form . by performing charge conjugation on the right - handed fermions only , @xmath11",
    ", where @xmath12 is the charge conjugation matrix , we write the model as one with a vector gauge symmetry .",
    "the fermionic part of the action becomes the usual schwinger model with a majorana - like yukawa coupling s_f & = & -d^2x .",
    "the anomalous current is now axial , @xmath13 , and the anomaly equation reads @xmath14 since the yukawa term has become majorana - like , it is convenient to work with a real 4-component majorana field @xmath15 .",
    "it is now straightforward to put this theory on a space - time lattice with lattice spacing @xmath16 , using wilson s lattice fermions , known from euclidean lattice field theory .",
    "lattice equations of motion and currents associated to global symmetries follow in the usual way .",
    "effective equations of motion can be derived by considering @xmath1 fermion fields with @xmath17 . after integrating out the fermions and rescaling @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 ,",
    "the resulting bosonic effective action is proportional to @xmath1 , and the remaining bosonic path integral can be approximated with a saddle point expansion . in leading order",
    "this results in the semiclassical maxwell - like equations of motion @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the bose fields are treated as classical fields , and the fermions , that are fully quantized , live in their background .",
    "the initial conditions for the original ( unscaled ) @xmath18 and @xmath26 have evidently to be such that they are of order @xmath20 .",
    "when the classical field is constrained to be homogeneous , the quantum fluctuations are treated in practise with a mode function expansion @xcite .",
    "since we want to allow also inhomogeneous bose fields , we use a generalized mode function expansion , i.e. at @xmath27 , the fermion field is expanded in plane waves in order to be able to specify the initial quantum state , but for @xmath28 the space dependence is determined by the field equations .",
    "the result is that the mode functions have both a momentum label @xmath29 corresponding to the initial state , and a general space ( and time ) dependence , written as @xmath30 .",
    "we expand the field as @xmath31,\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath32 @xmath33 is an eigenspinor of the dirac hamiltonian at @xmath27 , and @xmath34 labels the independent eigenspinors .",
    "expectation values of the time independent creation and annihilation operators @xmath35 specify the quantum state at @xmath27 .",
    "we take either a vacuum or a thermal initial state , summarized by @xmath36\\ket = 1 - 2f_p({\\alpha})$ ] , with @xmath37 the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the bosonic equations are ( in the temporal gauge @xmath38 ) & & _0_0 a_1x = e^2 ( j_h_x^1 + j_f_x^1 ) , + & & _1_0 a_1x = -e^2 ( j_h_x^0 + j_f_x^0 ) , + & & _0_0 _ x = d_1 d_1_x - 2(|_x|^2 - v^2_b)_x + gf_x . the second equation is gauss law .",
    "the ( primed ) derivatives denote forward ( backward ) lattice derivatives .",
    "@xmath39 is the classical higgs contribution to the current .",
    "the fermion current @xmath40 and force due to the fermions on the scalar field @xmath41 can be written in terms of mode functions .",
    "the mode functions themselves obey the lattice dirac equation in the presence of the bose fields .",
    "this gives a closed set of equations .",
    "also observables such as the fermion vector and axial charge are expressed in terms of the mode functions . as an example , we show here the axial charge density @xmath42 on the lattice j^0_5_x&= & -_p , _ p ( ) . here",
    "@xmath43 is a matrix appearing in the majorana description .",
    "the equations of motion still contain the divergence of the quantum theory . since we only integrated out the fermions , and we treat the scalar field completely classical , only the fermion loop divergence enters in the equations .",
    "@xmath44 is a logarithmically divergent sum .",
    "it s divergence is canceled with the appropriate bare @xmath45 .",
    "we have used the following initial conditions .",
    "the initial fermion mode functions are eigenspinors of the dirac hamiltonian in the presence of a vacuum configuration of bose fields , i.e. @xmath46 , and we take a vacuum initial state for the creation and annihilation operators , i.e. @xmath47 . the higgs field is initially homogeneous , @xmath48 , but for its time derivative , @xmath49 , only the low momentum modes have a non - zero amplitude .",
    "the high momentum modes of @xmath50 are initially zero .",
    "this makes the classical field inhomogeneous .",
    "both the chern - simon number and its time derivative have a non - zero value at @xmath27 .",
    "the initial configuration is chosen in such a way that it obeys gauss law .",
    "this completely specifies the spatial dependence of @xmath51 .",
    "the quantum divergence in the equations is treated in the following way .",
    "the renormalized higgs expectation value @xmath52 is fixed , and then the corresponding bare @xmath53 is determined using the equation for the scalar field at @xmath27 .",
    "we checked that this leads to convergent physical results when the lattice spacing @xmath54 is made smaller .",
    "every dimensionful parameter is written in units of @xmath21 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath55 and the renormalized higgs expectation value is @xmath56 .",
    "the physical size is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "furthermore , the temporal lattice spacing @xmath59 , and the number of lattice points @xmath60 .",
    "we now discuss the numerical results .",
    "gauss law demands that the total charge @xmath61 is zero .",
    "our initial conditions are such that both the higgs charge , @xmath62 , and the fermion charge , @xmath63 , are separately zero . under real - time evolution , having an inhomogeneous system , the individual charges do not stay zero , but the sum vanishes ( up to machine precision ) .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig1a ] .",
    "since we solve a large set of partial differential equations ( in particular there is an equation for every mode function , and there are @xmath64 mode functions ) , this is non - trivial .",
    "also the total energy @xmath65 is conserved , but not to such high accuracy as the charge .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig2a ] .",
    "the fermions are initialized in a vacuum state ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "all the initial energy is contained in the low momentum modes of the bose fields .",
    "this is clearly a non - equilibrium situation , and energy is transferred into the fermion degrees of freedom during time evolution .",
    "interesting observables are the chern - simons number @xmath6 and the anomalous axial charge @xmath67 . according to the anomaly equation",
    ", these should be equal during time evolution .",
    "@xmath6 is a simple observable in the sense that it is just the sum of @xmath68 over all lattice points . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath67 is obtained by taking the sum over inner products between all modes functions , see ( [ eqq5 ] ) .",
    "results are given in fig .",
    "it shows that @xmath67 follows @xmath6 at early times , in agreement with the anomaly equation . for later times",
    "they start to deviate .",
    "this is an artefact of the lattice discretization , which is reduced by taking smaller lattice spacing . in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] we show the higgs order parameter .",
    "we considered the real - time dynamics of a coupled system of classical bose fields and a quantized fermion field , represented by generalized mode functions , on a lattice in space and time . because of the presence of @xmath64 spinor mode functions that are space dependent , the method is , especially in @xmath4 dimensions , numerically demanding .",
    "the @xmath0 dimensional model is an excellent toy model to test the possibility of numerical calculations in a non - homogeneous , non - equilibrium context , including anomalous fermion production .",
