    "over 100 jupiter - mass planets have been discovered around nearby stars with precise radial velocity measurements ( see marcy et al .",
    "2003 for a review ) .",
    "as time goes by , the range of periods and amplitudes accessible to these surveys increases , moving to longer periods and lower amplitudes ( e.g.  carter et al .  2003",
    "; fischer et al .",
    "2003 ; jones et al .  2003 ) .",
    "recently , the detection of neptune - mass planets with periods less than ten days has been reported ( butler et al .  2004 ; mcarthur et al .  2004 ; santos et al .  2004 )",
    ". in this paper",
    ", we quantify the detectability of low mass planets in close orbits , and discuss the prospects for detecting earth mass objects .",
    "we first discuss possible origins of such planets and the importance of detecting them .      in the conventional planet formation scenario ( safronov 1969 ; pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) , heavy elements coagulate into terrestrial - planet - like cores prior to the formation of jupiter - mass planets by subsequent accretion of gas .",
    "the critical mass which segregates these two populations is @xmath7 a few @xmath8 , determined by the requirement of sufficiently high cooling efficiency in the gas envelope ( stevenson 1982 ; bodenheimer & pollack 1986 ; ikoma et al .",
    "2000 ) . in a minimum mass nebula , both type of planets",
    "are thought to form at distances from their host stars comparable to those of planets in the solar system .    as a consequence of their tidal interaction ,",
    "gas giant planets may undergo orbital migration ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 ) which is finally halted either by their interaction with their host stars or through the local or global depletion of disks ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ; trilling et al .  2002 ; armitage et al .  2002 ; ida & lin 2004 ) . in this process",
    ", many gas giants are expected to be disrupted , transferring their mass onto the host star ( trilling et al .",
    "2002 ) , perhaps driven by tidal inflation ( gu , lin , & bodenheimer 2003 ) .",
    "ida & lin ( 2004 ) estimate that 9095% of planets that migrate to @xmath9 must perish .",
    "recent models of evaporation of material from hot jupiters ( lammer et al .  2003 ;",
    "baraffe et al .  2004 ; lecavalier des etangs et al .",
    "2004 ) find that gas giants may undergo significant mass loss , and perhaps be completely evaporated , during their lifetimes , although the efficiency and rates of evaporation remain uncertain ( yelle 2004 ) .",
    "this inference raises the possibility of a class of remnant `` hot neptunes '' or rocky cores in close orbits days ) . ] .",
    "an alternative way to produce low - mass planets in close orbits is by resonant capture during migration of a hot jupiter . along their migration paths ,",
    "gas giant planets capture other planets onto their mean motion resonances as in the case of gj 876 ( lee & peale 2002 ; nelson & papaloizou 2002 ; kley et al .",
    "mandell & sigurdsson ( 2003 ) also consider the survivability of earth mass objects in the wake of jupiter migration .",
    "a natural implication of the core - accretion followed by migration scenario for the origin of hot jupiters is that they may harbor earth - mass planets ( `` hot earths '' ) orbiting close to their mean motion resonances ( aarseth & lin 2004 , in preparation ) . in the gravitational instability scenario ,",
    "however , both ice giants and terrestrial planets are assumed to emerge long after the formation of gas giant planets ( boss , wetherill , & haghighipour 2002 ) .    due to the effect of tidal circularization",
    ", the semimajor axis of the hot earth is expected to be slightly interior to the mean motion resonance , and its survival is ensured by the relativistic precession induced by the gravitational potential of the host star ( novak et al .",
    "2003 , mardling & lin 2004 ) . after halting its inward migration",
    ", a hot jupiter may move outwards due to either its tidally induced mass loss ( trilling et al .",
    "2002 ; gu et al .  2003 ) , or tidal interaction with a rapidly spinning host star ( stassun et al .  1999 ; dobbs - dixon et al .",
    "2004 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the periods of the close - in earth and hot jupiter may not be close to commensurability .",
    "the presence of earth - mass planets close to the external mean motion resonance of a hot jupiter is also possible . in the wake of a migrating gas giant , the prototerrestrial planets in the disk external to its orbit",
    "may also undergo type i inward migration ( ward 1986 ) as a consequence of their own tidal interaction with the disk gas ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) . by inducing the formation of a gap near its orbit",
    ", a migrating jupiter provides a tidal barrier which prevents any migrating terrestrial planets from passing it . but",
    "this possibility is uncertain since type i migration is strongly affected by the poorly known turbulence near the coorbital region ( koller et al .",
    "2003 ; nelson & papaloizou 2004 ) .",
    "if this process is efficient , it could lead to the formation of an isolated hot earth ( ward 1997 ; bodenheimer et al .",
    "even if type i migration is inefficient , the presence of a hot jupiter can induce planetesimals to accumulate and form a hot earth just beyond the outer edge of the gap ( bryden et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the presence of additional long - period gas giant planets ,",
    "a sweeping resonance may also lead to the inward migration and accumulation of terrestrial planets just exterior to the orbits of hot jupiters ( lin , nagasawa , & thommes 2004 ) .",
    "based on the core - accretion scenario for planet formation , it is already tempting to infer the existence of terrestrial planets in extrasolar systems from the detection of jupiter - mass gas giants ( ida & lin 2004 ) .",
    "however , the actual detection of a terrestrial mass object would be the first confirmation of rocky cores in an extrasolar planetary system ( see however kuchner 2003 ) .",
    "the association of a hot earth with the interior mean motion resonance of a hot jupiter is particularly interesting because it would indicate that cores are formed prior to the emergence and migration of gas giant planets , providing strong support for the conventional core - accretion scenario for planet formation , and for the ubiquity of terrestrial planets in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "the presence of a hot earth exterior to the orbit of a hot jupiter would support the notion of a tidal barrier which has the potential to enhance the formation probability of multiple planet systems . finally , the discovery of any isolated hot earth would support the concept of type i migration .      in this paper",
    ", we discuss the detectability of such low mass companions in radial velocity surveys . in particular , we concentrate on the scenario in which a terrestrial planet was captured into the mean motion resonance of a migrating jupiter - mass planet , resulting in the formation of a `` hot earth '' which is near the interior mean motion resonances of a `` hot jupiter '' . with the limitations of radial velocity surveys ,",
    "the detection of a hot earth external to the orbit of a hot jupiter is much more difficult .",
    "we also calculate the detection thresholds for isolated low mass planets",
    ".    being offset from the mean motion resonance of any nearby hot jupiters , the expected contribution to the radial velocity amplitude @xmath10 from a closely orbiting several earth - mass object is @xmath11 where @xmath3 is the orbital period , @xmath12 is the mass of the planet , and @xmath5 is the mass of the star .",
    "this is comparable to the expected velocity variability from measurement errors , and intrinsic stellar `` jitter ''",
    "( saar , butler , & marcy 1998 ) .",
    "the orbital frequency is well - predicted for a hot earth close to a mean motion resonance with a hot jupiter , and so we expect the detectability to be somewhat better than a blind frequency search .",
    "here we calculate the detectability and discuss the number of observations , and observing strategy needed for detection .",
    "we simulate a set of observational data for a system of planets which are on circular orbits .",
    "we search for periodicities using the lomb - scargle periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) . for a set of @xmath2 observation times @xmath13 , velocities @xmath14 , and measurement errors @xmath15 , and a trial orbital frequency @xmath16 , we fit the function @xmath17 to the velocity data by minimising @xmath18 .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is @xmath19 since there are 3 parameters in the model .",
    "we measure the goodness of fit as a function of trial frequency @xmath20 using the periodogram power @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the reduced @xmath25 of a fit of a constant to the data , @xmath26 . here , we extend the original lomb - scargle periodogram by allowing the mean to float at each frequency ( walker et al .",
    "1995 ; nelson & angel 1998 ; cumming , marcy , & butler 1999 ) , rather than subtracting the mean of the data @xmath27 prior to the fit .",
    "the periodogram power measures the improvement of @xmath25 when the sinusoid is included in the fit , in a similar way to a classical f - test ( see cumming 2004 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "a typical doppler measurement error is @xmath28@xmath29 , although the precision of doppler surveys continues to improve towards @xmath30 ( mayor et al .",
    "2003 ; butler et al .",
    "however , at these high precisions , stellar `` jitter '' becomes the limiting factor .",
    "jitter is observed at the few m / s level , depending on stellar properties such as age , rotation , and level of magnetic activity ( saar et al .",
    "1998 ; santos et al .",
    "2000 ) . for simplicity , we add gaussian noise with amplitude @xmath31 throughout this paper , which represents both doppler errors and stellar jitter .",
    "the mass which can be detected scales proportional to @xmath4 , so that our results can be rescaled to the appropriate value of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , a @xmath32 planet with @xmath33 has the same detectability as a @xmath34 planet with @xmath31 .",
    "we have checked that this scaling applies for the two planet case , when the mass of the hot jupiter is much greater than the hot earth .",
    "our search procedure is to find the best - fit orbit for the hot jupiter , subtract it from the data , and search the residuals for periodicities .",
    "this is a much simpler approach than simultaneous fitting of both sinusoids , and is valid as long as the parameters from the two fits are uncorrelated .",
    "we have checked that this is the case , and find that only for sampling rates much greater than @xmath35 is there some improvement by simultaneous fitting .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the orbital solution for the hot jupiter is already known from previous measurements , in which case this information can be used to subtract the hot jupiter s signal .",
    "therefore , we also consider the cases where the full orbital solution or only the orbital period is known in advance .",
    "if the hot jupiter orbital period is known in advance , we find the best fit amplitude and phase at that period . if no information is available , we search for the hot jupiter by evaluating @xmath36 for periods between 2 and 4 days on a grid with frequency spacing @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the duration of the observations . to adequately subtract the hot jupiter s signal ,",
    "it is important to accurately determine its orbital frequency .",
    "therefore the frequency with the largest periodogram power is used as the starting value for a more accurate search for the maximum of @xmath36 .",
    "once the hot jupiter s orbit has been subtracted , we calculate @xmath36 for the residuals , and find the maximum periodogram power @xmath39 near the 2:1 resonance .",
    "we do not include a constant term in the fit to the residuals , giving @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig : periodogram ] shows an example of the velocity residuals and the periodograms before and after subtraction .",
    "the peak at @xmath41 days in the initial periodogram is due to aliasing of the hot jupiter s frequency .",
    "after subtraction , the signal due to a @xmath42 planet at @xmath43 days shows clearly as a peak in @xmath21 .",
    "the importance of accurately determining the hot jupiter s orbital period is illustrated by figure [ fig : w_brent ] , which shows two examples of the velocity residuals after subtraction of the hot jupiter signal . in the first case ( upper panels ) , we take the hot jupiter period returned by the periodogram ( evaluated with a frequency spacing @xmath37 ) ; in the second case ( lower panels ) , we find a more accurate period estimate by searching for the peak in @xmath36 . in the first case ,",
    "the velocity residuals are dominated by the inadequately - subtracted hot jupiter signal rather than the hot earth .",
    "how accurately must the hot jupiter period be known ? if the orbital frequency is known to an accuracy @xmath44 , the amplitude of the residual part of the hot jupiter s signal is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the hot jupiter amplitude .",
    "the accuracy to which the hot jupiter frequency may be determined is @xmath47 ( e.g. bretthorst 1988 ) , so that @xmath48 independent of @xmath38 and @xmath46 . for large @xmath2 , @xmath49 , so that the residual part of the hot jupiter signal has no effect on detectability .",
    "however , for @xmath50 , the residuals from the subtraction contribute a significant additional source of velocity variability .",
    "even when the hot jupiter period is known in advance , there is an uncertainty in the fitted amplitude @xmath46 of @xmath51 , and phase of @xmath52 , giving an additional velocity scatter for low @xmath2 .",
    "therefore for small @xmath2 we expect detection of a hot earth to be more difficult when the full orbital solution for the hot jupiter is not specified in advance .",
    "the significance of the maximum observed periodogram power @xmath39 depends on how often an equally good or better fit would occur purely due to a noise fluctuation .",
    "we determine this with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we generate data sets with a hot jupiter plus noise , i.e.  without a hot earth , and search for a second companion .",
    "the 99% detection threshold @xmath53 is determined as the value of @xmath21 which is exceeded in only @xmath54% of trials , or alternatively for which there is a 1% false alarm probability @xmath55 .",
    "the detection threshold is indicated in figure [ fig : periodogram ] by the dashed line .",
    "we adopt a similar monte carlo approach to determine the detection probability .",
    "we generate a large number of data sets for each choice of @xmath56 and @xmath2 , and calculate the fraction of trials for which the hot earth is detected . a random distribution of inclinations is included .",
    "figure [ fig : dp_me ] shows the detection efficiency as a function of number of observations @xmath2 for @xmath57 , 1.5 , 2 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we simulate 1 observation per 8 hour night , and take observations for successive nights . in these simulations , we search for the hot earth orbital period between @xmath54 and @xmath59 days . figure [ fig : dp_frange ] shows the effect of changing this frequency range . if the frequency of the hot earth is specified in advance , the detectability is increased since the number of `` independent frequencies '' in the search is less , giving a smaller chance of a false alarm due to a noise fluctuation .",
    "this is the well - known `` bandwidth penalty '' ( e.g.  vaughan et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "in figure [ fig : mass ] , we show the number of observations needed to detect a given mass 50% of the time .",
    "the crosses are for data sets containing only a hot earth , or equivalently , for the case when the hot jupiter orbit is completely known in advance .",
    "the triangles are for the case with a hot jupiter whose orbital period is known in advance , and the circles for the case with a hot jupiter , but with a full search for both orbital periods .",
    "for @xmath60@xmath61 , planets with @xmath62 can be detected .",
    "however , detection of a planet with @xmath63 requires @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , detection of the hot earth after fitting for the hot jupiter s signal is harder than detection of the hot earth alone or with the hot jupiter orbit fully specified in advance ( compare the crosses and circles in fig  [ fig : mass ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to the additional velocity scatter at low @xmath2 from inadequate subtraction of the hot jupiter s signal ( @xmath66 in eq .",
    "[ [ eq : deltav ] ] ) .      in this section",
    ", we derive an analytic estimate for the detection threshold , following the approach of cumming ( 2004 ) , who discusses the detectability of single planets with radial velocities .",
    "first , we determine @xmath53 semi - analytically for gaussian noise .",
    "the cumulative distribution of @xmath36 for a single frequency is ( e.g.  cumming et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath67 or for large @xmath2 , @xmath68 for a given false alarm probability @xmath55 , the detection threshold is given by @xmath69^{n_i},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the number of `` independent frequencies '' searched .",
    "for @xmath71 , @xmath72 for unevenly - sampled data , @xmath70 must be determined by monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , since the spacing of periodogram peaks is @xmath73 , a rough estimate is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the frequency range searched ( cumming 2004 ) .",
    "we next make an analytic estimate of the detection threshold . in the presence of a signal with amplitude @xmath10",
    ", the average power is @xmath76 ( groth 1975 ; scargle 1982 ; horne & baliunas 1986 , we have accounted for the different normalization ) . for a given @xmath70 and @xmath55 , we find the detection threshold @xmath53 by inverting equation ( [ eq : fa ] ) using the analytic distribution ( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "then , setting @xmath77 gives the signal to noise ratio needed to detect the signal @xmath78^{1/2}\\\\ & \\approx & \\left[2\\ln(n_i / f)\\over n\\right]^{1/2},\\label{eq : sn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( cumming et al .",
    "2003 ; cumming 2004 ) where the approximation is for large @xmath2 . as expected , the signal to noise ratio goes down as @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "combining equation ( [ eq : k ] ) with equation ( [ eq : sn1 ] ) or ( [ eq : sn2 ] ) gives the velocity amplitude and mass which can be detected 50% of the time .",
    "equation ( [ eq : sn2 ] ) ( @xmath80 ) gives @xmath81\\over 9.2}\\right)^{1/2},\\ ] ] or @xmath82\\over 9.2}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left({m_\\star\\over m_\\odot}\\right)^{2/3},\\ ] ] where we have also used the fact that the mean value of @xmath83 is @xmath84 , and we take @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] compares the analytic results for arbitrary @xmath2 ( eq .  [ [ eq : sn1 ] ] ) with our numerical simulations .",
    "the dashed and dotted curves show the analytic models for two different estimates of @xmath70 .",
    "the agreement is excellent for a single planet . for the two planet case , equation ( [ eq : m50 ] )",
    "applies for @xmath87 , but underestimates @xmath88 for @xmath65 . for such low @xmath2",
    ", we expect @xmath66 ( eq .  [ [ eq : deltav ] ] ) , making detection of the hot earth more difficult than in the single planet case .",
    "we now address to what extent the spacing of the observation times affects the detectability of the hot earth .",
    "first , we consider observations made on successive nights , but with different numbers of observations per night .",
    "figure [ fig : dp_days ] shows the detection probability as a function of number of nights , and as a function of number of observations . for a fixed number of observations ,",
    "increasing the sampling rate reduces the duration of the data , leading to less frequency resolution and therefore smaller @xmath70 .",
    "we therefore expect better detectability for a faster sampling rate at a fixed number of observations .",
    "this is initially the case , as can be seen by comparing the curves for 1 per night and 5 per night in figure [ fig : dp_days ] .",
    "however , for very rapid sampling , a large number of observations must be made before a complete hot jupiter orbit is sampled , therefore allowing the orbital parameters to be determined accurately enough for a good subtraction .",
    "this is likely the reason for the decrease in detectability on going to more than 5 observations per night in figure [ fig : dp_days ] . although observing more rapidly always leads to detection in a fewer number of nights ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_days ] ) , the number of observations required eventiually becomes very large ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dp_days ] ) .",
    "therefore there is an optimum observing rate ( roughly a few per night for this case , but it depends slightly on the hot earth mass ) .",
    "although observing on successive nights would be possible with a dedicated telescope , current radial velocity surveys are limited by telescope scheduling .",
    "therefore , we have also simulated more realistic observation times for current surveys , by observing for three nights each month , with the seperation between observing runs randomly chosen between 20 and 40 days . we find that if the hot jupiter orbital parameters are not known in advance , the detectability can be affected by the observing scheme , because of aliasing of the hot jupiter frequency leading to subtraction of an incorrect orbit . however , in the practical case that the hot jupiter period is known from previous observations , the hot jupiter orbit can be adequately subtracted , and the effect of the observing strategy is small .",

    "the required eccentricity is comparable to current measurement uncertainties , typically @xmath139 . fitting a circular orbit to a keplerian orbit with eccentricity @xmath140",
    "gives a residual scatter @xmath141 , where @xmath46 is the amplitude .",
    "for a hot jupiter with @xmath142 the scatter in the residuals is comparable to the signal from a hot earth .",
    "however , since the fourier components of a keplerian orbit are at the orbital period and its harmonics , whereas the hot earth is expected to lie outside the 2:1 resonance , it should be possible to distinguish between these two possibilities , although simultaneous fitting of the hot jupiter and earth orbits may be required .",
    "therefore we do not expect a significant reduction in sensitivity over the detection thresholds calculated in this paper .",
    "this issue is closely related to the important question of determining the uncertainty in orbital parameters ( ford 2003 ) , particularly the eccentricity of hot jupiters , and deserves further study .",
