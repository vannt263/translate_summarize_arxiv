    "solontsov and silin @xcite suggested that un is a weak itinerant - electron antiferromagnet which has a different mechanism from the nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "they have suggested that the magnetic ordering is caused by the polarization of bands rather than the sdw type fermi surface instability .",
    "therefore , it is essential to reveal the overall electronic structure of un to understand the nature of the u  5@xmath1 states in un .",
    "the electronic properties of un have been studied experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite .",

    "meanwhile , a recent xps study on un showed that the u  4@xmath1 core - level spectrum shows an asymmetric line shape characteristic of a metal and multiple final state structures , which were also interpreted as the dual nature of the u  5@xmath1 states . from the theoretical point of view , it has been suggested that the electronic structure can not be understood within the framework of a local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "modak and verma@xcite studied the electronic structure of un by the lda as well as the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) , and suggested that the lda is insufficient for the description of its electronic structure .",

    "it shows a spin - orbit splitting corresponding to u  4@xmath18 and u  4@xmath19 , and both of them have a broad asymmetric line shape .",
    "this is a common feature of u  4@xmath1 core - level spectra of metallic uranium compounds .",

    "this spectral line shape is similar to that of itinerant u  5@xmath1 compounds .",
    "the binding energy of u  4@xmath18 main line is 377.27 ev , which is in a good agreement with the previous study on un thin film ( 377.3 ev)@xcite .",
    "this is within the binding energies of 5@xmath20 final - state peak of various itinerant uranium compounds@xcite , suggesting that un can be classified into itinerant uranium compounds . in the previous photoemission experiment ,",

    "however , there is no such satellite structure in the present u  4@xmath1 spectrum .",

    "this band has a large contribution from the u  5@xmath1 states especially in the vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "as the band goes from the w point to the x point in the first brillouin zone , it approaches @xmath9 .",
    "near the midpoint of the x - w line , its intensity suddenly decreases , suggesting that it crosses @xmath9 .",
    "meanwhile , weak but finite photoemission intensities just below @xmath9 persist outside the fermi momentum ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in the arpes spectra of other uranium compounds@xcite .",
    "its origin shall be discussed below . on the high binding energy side (",
    "@xmath23  ev ) , there exist weak and strongly dispersive bands . since they have weaker intensities than those of bands near @xmath9 , they are assigned to contributions mainly from the n  @xmath17 bands .",
    "the overall structure of the present spectra are very similar to the previous results measured by he i ( @xmath2421.2  ev)@xcite , but there is one striking difference between them . in the previous arpes study , two non - dispersive bands were observed in the vicinity of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "one is located just below @xmath9 , while the other is located around @xmath250.6  ev , and they were assigned to the itinerant and localized components , respectively .",
    "this has been considered as the indication of the dual nature of the u  5@xmath1 electrons in un .",
    "however , we have observed a single itinerant band in the vicinity of @xmath9 , and the dual nature of the u  5@xmath1 electrons was not observed .",
    "those differences may originate from the higher surface sensitivity in the previous arpes study .    here , it should be noted that the intensities of observed bands are not symmetric with respect to the w point .",
    "for example , the band located just below @xmath9 has an asymmetric shape relative to the w point , and the intensity of its counterpart is very weak . since their intensities depend on the brillouin zone , this may be due to the photoemission structure factor ( psf ) effect as has been observed in arpes spectra of other materials @xcite . to eliminate this effect",

    ", we compare the present arpes spectra with the result of the band - structure calculation within the lda framework treating all the u  5@xmath1 electrons as being itinerant .",

    "[ arpes_xwx ] ( d ) shows the fcc brillouin zone of un with the calculated fermi surfaces . in this simulation ,",
    "the following effects have been taken into account ; ( i ) the broadening in the @xmath26 direction due to the finite escape depth of photoelectrons , ( ii ) the lifetime broadening of photo - hole , ( iii ) photoemission cross - sections of orbitals , and ( iv ) the energy resolution and angular resolution of the electron analyzer .",
    "their details are described in appendix a. energy band dispersions corresponding to the x - w - x high symmetry line are shown in dashed curves , and are consistent with the results of the previous band structure - calculations@xcite . in the band - structure calculation ,",
    "band 8 forms the hole pocket fermi surface around the w point . on the high binding energy side , there exist strongly dispersive bands with contributions mainly from the n @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "a comparison between arpes spectra and the simulation shows that there is a good correspondence between the experimentally observed bands a - e and the calculated bands 4 - 8 , respectively , though the binding energies of bands a - d are deeper in the experiment than in the calculation . on the other hand , there are some disagreements between the experiment and the calculation . for example , there is a clear gap structure between the bottom of band 8 and the top of band 7 in the band - structure calculation , while they are not clearly seen in experiment .",
    "bands 7 and 8 are mainly consist of the n  @xmath17 states and u  5@xmath1 state , respectively , and the absence of a clear gap in the experimental spectra suggests that the hybridization between them is weaker in the experiment than in the calculation . although there exist those discrepancies , a good one - to - one correspondence between them suggests that band - structure calculation gives a reasonable description of the experimentally obtained band structure .",
    "here , it should be noted that there exist finite photoemission intensities at @xmath9 outside @xmath22 in this simulation as it was observed in the experiment .",
    "its origin is mainly due to the finite broadening along momentum directions and the three dimensionality of its electronic structure .",
    "therefore , these finite intensities at the fermi energy observed in the arpes spectra of other uranium compounds such as ub@xmath21 would be explained by this effect .",
    "next , we show the changes of the electronic structure associated with the antiferromagnetic transition . before we show the arpes spectra",
    ", we explain a relationship between the arpes scan in the pm phase and the afm phase . in the pm phase , the crystal structure is fcc . in the afm phase ,",
    "the magnetic moments are aligned ferromagnetically within the ( 001 ) plane , and are coupled antiferromagnetically between the neighboring ( 001 ) plane .",
    "there are three equivalent directions of the afm ordering vector , [ 100 ] , [ 010 ] , and [ 001 ] , and the brillouin zone should be a diamond shape whose direction depends on the directions shown in fig .",
    "[ arpes_tmp ] ( a ) . since those ordering directions will form domains on a very small length , and the beam spot is expected to cover multiple domains .",
    "the arpes spectra taken along the x - w - x direction in the pm brillouin zone corresponds to a mixture of signals from the m-@xmath27 , m - r - m , and @xmath27-m directions in the afm phase .",
    "the relationship between the pm and the afm brillouin zone is as shown in fig .",

    "the positions of bands estimated from their momentum distribution curves ( mdcs ) and its folding are also shown in fig .",
    "[ arpes_tmp ] ( b ) by solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the behavior of the quasi - particle band is more clearly recognized . around the w point , there is a v - shaped band just below @xmath9 , and it forms an electron pocket fermi surface .",
    "here , it should be noted that the fitted band has a larger slope than the calculated band in the vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "this seems to be inconsistent with the fact that the experimental band has a heavier electron mass than that of the band - structure calculation as it is inferred from the larger electronic specific heat coefficient in the experiment ( @xmath2849  mjk@xmath29mol@xmath30 ) than in the calculation ( @xmath2817.95  mjk@xmath29mol@xmath30 ) .",
    "this might be mainly due to the very small energy scale of the renormalization of the experimental quasi - particle bands .",
    "in fact , the effect of the renormalization appears in the energy range of few tens mev of the vicinity of @xmath9 in the quasi - particle bands of heavy fermion compound usb@xmath21@xcite . if the quasi - particle band has a renormalization in a similar energy scale , the structure can not be observed with the present experimental energy resolution .",
    "moreover , a fitting of mdcs generally gives a larger slope than the actual band when the band is nearly flat and broad@xcite .",
    "this can be inferred from figs  [ arpes_tmp ] ( b ) and ( d ) where fitting of energy distribution curves ( edcs ) should give nearly flat band just below the @xmath9 around @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the peak positions estimated from mdcs in the vicinity of @xmath9 do not correspond to the actual band positions in the present analysis .",
    "figure  [ arpes_tmp ] ( d ) shows the arpes spectra measured by the same geometry of fig .",
    "[ arpes_tmp ] ( b ) , but at 20  k. the sample is in the afm phase , and this scan direction would correspond to the m-@xmath27 , m - r - m , and @xmath27-m directions in the afm brillouin zone . it is shown that spectra do not show significant changes . here",

    "the mdc - fitted peak positions and its folding are shown by solid and dashed curves .",
    "the basic structure is essentially identical to those measured in the pm phase .",
    "therefore , the changes in arpes spectra associated with afm transition is very small .    to see the changes of those bands in detail ,",
    "we have compared fitted bands in both phases .",
    "figure  [ arpes_tmp ] ( e ) shows a comparison of the fitted bands between the pm and afm phases .",

    "the bands are almost identical in the pm and the afm phases , but there exists a small but clear difference around the zone boundary ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "as the compound undergoes the afm phase transition , the crossing point of bands moves toward lower binding energies by about 47  mev .",
    "since the electronic structure of this crossing point is affected by the folding of bands due to the magnetic ordering [ 010 ] , this change is considered to be due to the pm to afm transition .",

    "[ arpes_tmp ] , we have compared the experimental fermi surfaces with the band - structure calculation in the pm phase .",
    "the large and round - shaped fs centered at the x point was observed while a small and square shaped fs centered at the x point was not clearly observed although both of them originate from the same band .",

    "[ arpes_xwx ] ( a ) .",
    "the cross - sections of the fermi surfaces are also shown by the red solid curves . here , it should be noted that the photoemission intensities become strong outside and inside the round - shaped and square - shaped fermi surfaces , respectively , in the simulation .",
    "this is due to the finite energy resolution ( @xmath3785  mev ) as well as finite energy window ( @xmath37100  mev ) of photoemission intensity integration , which make the image include intensities from bands below @xmath9 . although the size of experimentally observed fermi surface is slightly smaller than that of the calculation , the shape of large round fermi surface centered at the x point matches between experiment and calculation .",

    "the magnitude of magnetic moment in the band structure calculation in the afm phase is 0.50 @xmath4 while the experimental value is 0.75 @xmath4 .",
    "they are similar magnitude , and this also supports an itinerant description of u  5@xmath1 states in un . here",

    "therefore , the cw behavior in the pm phase also originates from itinerant u  5@xmath1 electrons .",
    "meanwhile , the changes of arpes spectra due to the afm transition were very small .",
    "in addition , the shape of the fermi surface of un has highly three - dimensional shape , and its nesting region is very small , suggesting that the nesting of fermi surfaces is unlikely as an origin of the afm transition .",
    "therefore , although the itinerant description is appropriate for the u  5@xmath1 states , a simple nesting scenario can not be applied to the afm ordering in un .",
    "this aspect is consistent with the picture of the weak itinerant antiferromagnetism@xcite where the formation of gap at @xmath9 is not the main origin of the magnetism .    here , we consider the changes of arpes spectra associated with the afm transition .",
    "the changes of spectral function due to the afm transition have been studied for some itinerant antiferromagnet experimentally@xcite .",
    "the most extensively studied material is chromium metal , which is an itinerant antiferromagnet showing incommensurate sdw - type ordering . in the arpes studies of chromium metal , the afm transition was observed in the arpes spectra as the emergence of back - folded replica bands due to the magnetic brillouin zone , and the formation of a hybridization gap in a large portion of the fermi surfaces .",
    "the back - folded bands are hybridized with the original bands at the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone , and the intensity is transferred from the original bands to the back - folded bands in the vicinity of their crossing points .",
    "the spectral intensities of the upper and lower split bands are given by the coherent factors @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively @xcite .",
    "for un , the formation of the hybridization gap nor the back - folded bands were not so clear as chromium metal at the zone boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone .",
    "meanwhile , the position of the band is shifted toward lower binding energies by about 47  mev at the boundary of the magnetic brillouin zone in which the magnetic moment is directed along the [ 010 ] direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ arpes_tmp ] ( e ) .",
    "this might be due to the formation of a small hybridization gap in the vicinity of their crossing point .",
    "the small gap results from the small hybridization , and the folded bands should have a weak intensity in this case .",
    "therefore , the observation of the hybridization gap itself was impossible in the present experiment , but the observed changes might be due to the formation of the gap .",
    "the small changes of electronic structure due to the afm transition are consistent with the picture of the weak itinerant antiferromagnetism where spin - polarized itinerant electrons form moments in both of the pm and the afm phases .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of the antiferromagnet uranium nitride ( un ) has been studied by angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy using soft x - rays ( @xmath0=420 - 520  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> strongly dispersive bands with large contributions from the u  5@xmath1 states were observed in arpes spectra , and form fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure as well as the fermi surfaces in the paramagnetic phase are well explained by the band - structure calculation treating all the u  5@xmath1 electrons as being itinerant , suggesting that itinerant description of the u  5@xmath1 states is appropriate for this compound . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> changes in the spectral function due to the antiferromagnetic transition were very small . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes of the fermi surfaces in a paramagnetic phase are highly three - dimensional , and the nesting of fermi surfaces is unlikely as the origin of the magnetic ordering . </S>"
