    "measurements of the elemental abundances in qsos are important for understanding the physics and observable properties of the various emission / absorption regions",
    ". they can also provide valuable constrains on the extent and epoch of star formation in galactic nuclei .",
    "these constraints could be important complements to other studies of high - redshift galaxies ( involving , for example , the `` lyman - break '' galaxies or damped - ly@xmath4 absorbers ) that probe more extended structures and/or rely on very different data and techniques .",
    "three general , independent probes of qso abundances are readily observable at all redshifts : the broad emission lines ( bels ) , the broad absorption lines ( bals ) and the narrow associated ( intrinsic ) absorption lines ( aals ) .",
    "each of these probes has its own theoretical and observational uncertainties , some of which might be unknown .",
    "it is therefore essential to consider as many abundance diagnostics as possible .",
    "i am now involved in several projects to examine a wide range of emission and absorption diagnostics in qsos at different redshifts and luminosities .",
    "my principle collaborators are drs .",
    "t. barlow , f. chaffee , g. ferland , c. foltz , v. junkkarinen , k. korista and j. shields .",
    "the most recent work on bel abundances , based on the nv / heii and nv / civ line ratios ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 , ferland 1996 ) , indicates that the metallicities are typically solar or higher and nitrogen is selectively enhanced .",
    "there is also a significant trend in these line ratios suggesting higher metallicities in more luminous qsos ( see also osmer 1994 and korista 1998 ) .",
    "recent aal studies based on high - resolution spectroscopy are in general agreement with the bels , indicating typical metallicities from @xmath51/2 to a few times solar ( see petitjean 1994 , hamann 1997 , tripp 1996 , 1997 and refs . therein ) .",
    "the most surprising abundance results have come from studies of the bals , where the strengths of the metal - lines compared to hi  seem to require metallicities ( for example si / h ) from 20 to @xmath6100 times solar ( turnshek 1996 ; hamann 1997 ) .",
    "the secure detection of broad pv  1118,1128 absorption in one balqso , pg  0946 + 301 ( junkkarinen 1997 ) , and tentative detections in two others ( turnshek 1988 ; korista 1992 ) , suggest further that phosphorus is highly overabundant , with p / c  @xmath6  60 and p / h  @xmath61000 times solar ( see also hamann 1997 ) .",
    "these abundances , particularly the high p / c , are not only in conflict with the other diagnostics but they are also incompatible with any enrichment scheme dominated by types i or ii supernovae or cno - processed material from stellar envelopes .",
    "one possible explanation , suggested by shields ( 1996 ) , is that the bal gas is selectively enriched by novae .",
    "another possibility is that the bal abundance estimates are incorrect . in this contribution",
    "i argue for the latter ; the pv line has significant strength _ not _ because phosphorus is overabundant but because the stronger transitions are more optically thick than they appear .",
    "the true bal abundances are unknown .",
    "absorption lines are , in principle , better abundance probes than the emission lines because their strengths relate directly to the ionic column densities along our line - of - sight .",
    "the abundance ratios for any two elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 simply scale with the column densities , @xmath9   = \\",
    "\\log\\left({{n(a_i)}\\over{n(b_j)}}\\right )   + \\log\\left({{f(b_j)}\\over{f(a_i)}}\\right )   + \\log\\left({b\\over a}\\right)_{\\odot } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the solar abundance ratio , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the column densities and ionization fractions of elements @xmath7 and @xmath8 in ion stages @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the corrections factors , @xmath15 , are often uncertain because they depend on the poorly known ionization state of the absorber .",
    "hamann ( 1997 ) calculated ionization fractions and correction factors for a wide range of one - zone absorbers in photoionization equilibrium with the qso spectrum .",
    "those calculations showed that the correction factors needed to derive metal - to - hydrogen abundance ratios , [ m / h ] , from the column densities in hi and a metal ion m@xmath16 have well - defined minima ( at some particular level of ionization ) .",
    "therefore , even if the absorber is complex and the ionization state(s ) is(are ) unknown , we can still use the minimum correction factors to place firm lower limits on the [ m / h ] ratios ( see hamann 1997 for details ) .",
    "the correction factors for some metal - to - metal abundance ratios also have well defined limits that provide further robust constraints .",
    "one example is the correction factor @xmath12(civ)/@xmath12(pv ) , whose minimum value provides lower limits on [ p / c ] .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) recently examined the ionization , column densities and metal abundances in the balqso pg  1254 + 047 .",
    "the bal troughs in this object are detached , with velocities ranging from @xmath215,000 to @xmath227,000  , but the spectrum ( fig .",
    "1 ) appears in every other way typical of balqsos ( cf .",
    "weymann 1991 ) . like most optically selected balqsos ,",
    "this object has strong bals in high - ionization species such as civ , nv and ovi without absorption in mgii and other low - ionization lines .",
    "what makes this source particularly useful is its moderate redshift ( @xmath17 ) , which allows us to measure the bals at @xmath18    in a relatively sparse ``  forest . '' for example , broad absorption in the pv  1118,1128 doublet is unambiguously detected at the same outflow velocities as the stronger bals ( fig . 1 ; see hamann 1998 for a full discussion of the line identifications ) .",
    "the rarity of previous pv detections is probably due to the observational difficulties  namely , complex line blending or low signal - to - noise ratios across the pv wavelengths .",
    "( to my knowledge , there are no existing spectra of balqsos that can rule out pv absorption at a strength comparable to pg  1254 + 047 . )",
    "significant pv absorption might therefore be common in balqsos .",
    "significant pv absorption is , in any case , surprising because phosphorus is nominally a rare element ; in the sun the p / c abundance is @xmath50.001 while p / o is @xmath50.0004 .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) used the analysis outlined in  2 to derive specific abundance constraints for pg  1254 + 047 . a critical assumption in that analysis",
    "is that the measured bal troughs accurately represent the run of optical depth versus velocity for each ion . with that assumption ,",
    "the column densities follow by simple integration of the optical depth profiles .",
    "these column densities , combined with the minimum ionizations corrections ( from hamann 1997 ) , imply extreme abundances , [ c / h ]  @xmath19  1.0 , [ si / h ]  @xmath19  1.8 and [",
    "p / c ]  @xmath19  2.2 .",
    "hamann ( 1998 ) argued that the pv bal has a significant strength _ not _ because phosphorus is overabundant , but because the strong transitions like civ , nv and ovi are much more optically thick than they appear .",
    "explicit calculations of the line optical depths assuming solar relative abundances show that pv is the first weak line to appear as the stronger transitions become more saturated .",
    "the strength of the pv bal in pg  1254 + 047 implies optical depths of , for example , @xmath196 in , @xmath1925 in civ and @xmath1980 in ovi for solar relative abundances .",
    "these results indicate that the column densities derived from the measured troughs are gross underestimates and , consequently , the true abundances are unknown",
    ".    bals like civ , ovi and  might be optically thick while not reaching zero intensity if the absorber covers just part of the continuum source(s ) .",
    "furthermore , different optically thick lines can have different strengths and profiles if their coverage fractions differ .",
    "note that coverage fraction differences between bals ( that mimic simple optical depth or ionization effects in observed spectra ) can occur naturally if the absorbing regions have a range of ionization states or column densities .",
    "there is already direct evidence for partial coverage , and sometimes different coverage fractions in different lines , from the resolved multiplet ratios in the narrow components of some bals ( barlow & junkkarinen 1994 , wampler 1995 ) and aals ( barlow & sargent 1997 ; hamann 1997 ; hamann 1997 and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "partial coverage has also been inferred from spectropolarimetry of balqsos ( cohen 1995 , goodrich 1995 , hines & wills 1995 ) .",
    "we can not measure the coverage fractions from multiplet ratios in most bals , but i claim that the pv line signifies partial coverage and large line optical depths .",
    "strong support for this interpretation comes from the only known aal system with pv absorption , where the resolved doublets clearly indicate large optical depths and partial coverage in lines such as civ , nv and siiv ( barlow 1998 ) .",
    "the calculations by hamann ( 1998 ) also show that the pv bal in pg  1254 + 047 requires a minimum total column density ( in hi+hii ) of @xmath20 ( )  @xmath1 if the metallicity is roughly solar .",
    "the actual column density depends on the unknown ionization state ( higher ionizations require larger total columns for a given pv absorption strength ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the ranges of hi and total column densities consistent with the pg  1254 + 047 observations for photoionized clouds with different ionization parameters ( @xmath21 the dimensionless ratio of hydrogen - ionizing photon to hydrogen particle densities at the illuminated face of the clouds ) . at each @xmath22",
    ", the column densities are bounded below by the minimum optical depth of @xmath23 in pv and above by the maximum optical depths in undetected low - ionization lines like mgii and aliii ( see hamann 1998 ) .",
    "the total column densities implied by figure 2 are at least an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates from the bals , but they are consistent with the large absorbing columns derived from x - ray observations of balqsos ( mathur 1995 ; green & mathur 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , an x - ray absorber with @xmath20 ( )  @xmath24 could produce the observed bal spectrum if @xmath25 in a simple one - zone medium .",
    "the outflowing bal gas , at velocities from @xmath215,000 to @xmath227,000  in pg  1254 + 047 , is therefore a strong candidate for the x - ray absorber in balqsos .    while resolving an apparent discrepancy between the uv and x - ray data , higher column densities in the bal region might cause serious problems for radiative acceleration .",
    "the terminal velocity of a radiatively driven bal wind can be expressed as follows , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inner wind radius in units of 0.1  pc , @xmath28 is the qso luminosity in units of @xmath29  ergs  s@xmath30 , @xmath31 is the total column density in @xmath32  , @xmath33 is the central black hole mass relative to 10@xmath34  , and @xmath35 is the fraction of the spectral energy distribution absorbed or scattered in the wind .",
    "@xmath36 is the eddington luminosity for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a nominal bel region radius for @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "peterson 1993 ) .",
    "this equation holds strictly for open geometries , where the photons escaping one location in the balr are not scattered or absorbed in another location .",
    "the line optical depth calculations by hamann ( 1998 ) indicate that @xmath35 could be as large as a few tenths .",
    "therefore , the large total column densities implied by the pv analysis ( fig .",
    "2 ) _ can _ be radiatively driven to the observed velocities , but there are restrictions on the inner wind radius .",
    "for example , if the total column in outflowing gas is @xmath20 ( )  @xmath24 , the wind must arise from within @xmath50.01  pc of the qso .",
