    "the problem of how to break supersymmetry ( susy ) is a persistent one and , despite great leaps in understanding , there is yet to be a conclusive solution .",
    "many of the difficulties arise from the severe restrictions placed on models if they are to avoid having a supersymmetric vacuum . for example",
    ", the witten index must vanish @xcite which requires the model to be either chiral or contain massless matter , both of which pose serious model building difficulties .",
    "in addition , there should be an unbroken u(1)@xmath1 symmetry @xcite . not only does this condition greatly restrict the set of available models , it poses some deep phenomenological problems : namely the occurrence of a massless @xmath2-axion and anomalously small gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "an attractive way to sidestep these problems is to abandon the idea of global susy breaking and instead allow a supersymmetric vacuum to exist somewhere in the model .",
    "the universe can be placed in a metastable susy breaking vacuum and , as long as this vacuum is sufficiently long lived , the aforementioned problems can be ameliorated with no detrimental consequences .",
    "the idea was popularised by intriligator , seiberg , and shih ( iss ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that precisely this situation arises naturally in massive sqcd .",
    "there have since been many developments in the area and there are now a plethora of metastable susy breaking scenarios to choose from ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent examples ) .",
    "one aspect of metastability that has thus far been unexplored is the effect of non - topological solitons , such as q - balls @xcite , on the lifetime of the metastable vacuum .",
    "q - balls exist in many models with scalar fields charged under an unbroken , global u(1 ) symmetry , and it has long been known @xcite that such objects can induce phase transitions .",
    "an important difference between phase transitions precipitated by q - balls and those arising through more conventional means is that sub - critical vacuum bubbles can build up gradually in the former scenario @xcite : charge conservation ensures stability at any given stage .",
    "the timescale for these decays is therefore much less than one would estimate using the usual tunnelling action .",
    "many models of metastable susy breaking include an unbroken u(1 ) symmetry in the metastable susy breaking vacuum and , of course , support scalar excitations .",
    "it is therefore important to ask whether q - balls can speed up the decay of this vacuum relative to the usual estimate .",
    "perhaps of greatest phenomenological significance is the question of whether q - balls can induce a decay to the true , supersymmetric vacuum , although decays to lower lying susy breaking vacua are also important in models with uplifted metastable susy breaking vacua @xcite .",
    "it transpires that q - balls have a major effect on the vacuum lifetime and often make seemingly viable metastable vacua decay on a cosmologically negligible timescale .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in section [ sec : qb ]",
    "the salient features of q - balls and how they induce vacuum decay are reviewed .",
    "it is shown that q - balls exist in any metastable vacuum with an unbroken u(1 ) symmetry that does not contain massless , charged scalars .",
    "if there are no charged fermions or vector bosons lighter than the lightest charged scalar and the scalars remain in equilibrium , q - balls naturally increase in size until they reach a critical charge and the metastable vacuum is destabilised . furthermore ,",
    "statistical charge fluctuations are in themselves often enough to seed the formation of critical q - balls  no net charge asymmetry is required . in sections",
    "[ sec : gm ] and [ sec : iss ] these results are applied to a generic model of gauge mediation , and the model of iss when used in direct mediation .",
    "both are shown to undergo a premature phase transition to the supersymmetric vacuum for a large range of parameters . for gauge mediation",
    "the vacuum is destabilised unless the messenger mass is greater than @xmath0 gev . in the iss model",
    "one must have @xmath3 .",
    "section [ sec : con ] concludes and discusses some general model building strategies for mitigating the aforementioned effects .",
    "non - topological solitons are common in models whose vacua possess unbroken symmetries .",
    "global @xcite , local @xcite , abelian and non - abelian @xcite symmetries have been considered , but only the simplest case will be investigated in this article : a global u(1 ) .",
    "specifically , consider a model of a complex scalar field @xmath4 in a potential @xmath5 admitting such a symmetry .",
    "for a vacuum with unbroken u(1 ) to exist the potential must have a minimum at @xmath6 where , without loss of generality , one can fix @xmath7 .",
    "the physical argument for the existence of q - balls then goes as follows .",
    "given a total charge @xmath8 , which is a conserved quantity due to the unbroken u(1 ) symmetry , one must find the most energy efficient way of distributing it .",
    "if it is more economical to store the charge in a ` blob ' of non - zero field vevs than in free scalar particles there are stable q - ball solutions to the equations of motion .    mathematically , a field configuration @xmath9 with total charge @xmath8 should minimise the energy e=^3x(||^2+||^2+u())+ ( q-^*_t ) where the second term ensures charge conservation via the lagrange multiplier @xmath10 .",
    "rearranging gives e=^3x(|-i|^2)+ ^3x(||^2+u_())+q where an effective potential [ eq : qbuomega ] u_()u()-^2 ^ 2 has been defined .",
    "all time dependence occurs in the first term from which one deduces that classical solutions take the form @xmath11 for some real parameter @xmath10 and a real function @xmath12 that minimises ^3x(||^2+u _ ( ) ) i.e.  the problem reduces to one of finding the bounce solution associated with tunnelling in three euclidean dimensions @xcite .",
    "solutions to this problem , and therefore q - balls , generically exist if there are two minima of @xmath13 for a finite range of @xmath10 ; one at @xmath6 and a second _ lower _ minimum at @xmath14 .",
    "when the original potential is everywhere positive this is equivalent to demanding the function @xmath15 is minimised away from the origin .    if @xmath5 is allowed to take negative values the situation changes . of interest here",
    "are models where the vacuum @xmath6 is only metastable due to the model having a second minimum at @xmath14 where the potential @xmath16 is negative  the true vacuum .",
    "the effective potential then automatically has a minimum at non - zero @xmath4 for any choice of @xmath10 .",
    "this is clearly true for @xmath17 where said minimum coincides with the true vacuum . as @xmath10",
    "is increased the effective potential becomes more negative and the second minimum is pushed to larger values of @xmath4 until @xmath18 . at this point the minimum at the origin is destroyed but , as long as the allowed range of @xmath10 is non - trivial ( in other words @xmath19 ) q - ball solutions will always be supported can never destroy the second minimum as higher order terms protect it .",
    "if they do not the original potential can not be bounded from below . ] .",
    "to get a handle on what q - balls look like one can use their spherical symmetry @xcite to show that they satisfy = -+ for radial coordinate @xmath20 .",
    "the problem can be visualised as the damped newtonian motion of a particle in a potential @xmath21 with respect to ` time ' @xmath20 .",
    "q - ball solutions start from rest at non - zero @xmath4 and come to rest again after infinite time at @xmath6 . in the absence of the damping term the particle would have to start between @xmath22 and zero where @xmath23 , hence the full solution should lie somewhere a little further out than this where @xmath24 .",
    "since @xmath25 this alone does not suggest that the actual potential of the q - ball is negative , but for large enough q - balls it is indeed the case . to see why note that decreasing @xmath10 both moves the starting point of the motion away from the origin and decreases the curvature of the effective potential ( see figure [ fig : bounce ] ) .",
    "the particle thus starts off more slowly and has further to travel so inevitably takes longer to reach @xmath6 . in terms of the q - ball",
    "this means that @xmath4 is larger for a greater range of @xmath20 , or small @xmath10 corresponds to a large q - ball .",
    "conversely , when a q - ball is large enough @xmath10 is sufficiently small that the interior potential itself is negative , not just the effective potential .    .",
    "the particle comes to rest after infinite time at the origin so it starts just beyond the point where @xmath23 ( stars ) .",
    "as @xmath10 increases ( dashed ) the starting point moves closer to the origin and the potential becomes steeper._[fig : bounce],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    as a function of charge the total q - ball energy @xcite is e(q)=+e_s+e_v where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the surface and potential ( or volume ) energies , and the first term can be thought of as kinetic energy .",
    "the surface energy is always positive but suppose the potential becomes negative and consider varying the radius of the q - ball by a scaling factor @xmath28 @xcite ; the energy goes like [ eq : speq ] e_(q)=+^2e_s-^3|e_v| . for small values of @xmath8",
    "there are two stationary points with respect to @xmath28 : a local miniumum at @xmath29 ( this is the q - ball solution so exists by assumption ) and a local maximum at @xmath30 .",
    "however , as the charge is increased the two solutions move closer together until some critical charge @xmath31 where there is only one , unstable stationary point . above this critical charge",
    "@xmath28 diverges , i.e.  the q - ball expands to fill the universe with its own internal state , precipitating a phase transition .",
    "the situation is summarised in figure [ fig : ealpha ] .    .",
    "for charges less than the critical charge @xmath31 there is a stable solution at @xmath29 . for charges greater than or equal to @xmath31",
    "there are no stable solutions and the q - ball expands to fill the universe , initiating a phase transition._[fig : ealpha],scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to examine the properties of critical q - balls one typically needs to make some kind of approximation .",
    "first , suppose the q - ball has radius @xmath2 and can be approximated by taking @xmath32 inside the q - ball and zero everywhere else .",
    "the energy can be rewritten e(q)=+4r^2s - r^3|u(|)| . for the surface factor @xmath33 , approximated by @xcite [ eq : qbs ] s=_0^|^. this is the thin wall limit , and is valid for large q - balls when the two vacua of the original potential are nearly degenerate  specifically , the energy barrier @xmath34 is much greater than the depth of the global minimum @xmath35 ( see the solid curve in figure [ fig : bounce ] ) .",
    "one can then take @xmath36 so the q - ball interior coincides with the true vacuum , upon which the critical charge is defined explicitly by finding the value of @xmath8 for which both the first and second derivatives of the energy vanish : = = 0q_c=. in addition , one can deduce the value of @xmath2 for which this occurs and write down the volume and energy of a critical q - ball [ eq : qbvcthin ] v_c=,e(q_c)=v_c|u_0| which will be of use later .",
    "alternatively the original potential could be such that @xmath37 and the two vacua are highly non - degenerate ( the dashed curve in figure [ fig : bounce ] ) .",
    "now the thick wall approximation @xcite is more suitable . as mentioned earlier a large q - ball corresponds to small @xmath10 so the limit @xmath38 can be taken for a critical q - ball .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite then yield a critical volume and energy ) .",
    "when @xmath8 is too large the energy does not have a stationary point with respect to @xmath10 and the thin wall approximation is used instead .",
    "however , when the potential has a sufficiently deep global minimum the thick wall approximation remains valid even for @xmath38 .",
    "the energy is minimised ( albeit is not stationary ) at this extremal value of @xmath10 . ]",
    "[ eq : qbvcthick ] v_c~,e(q_c)~v_cu where @xmath34 is the height of the potential barrier . in",
    "both thin and thick wall cases the energy approaches a constant value when the charge becomes large .",
    "this is manifest for the thick wall approximation ; for the thin wall analogue it can easily be shown using the above equations and noting that @xmath35 is small .",
    "since the critical charge is the point at which the surface and potential energies balance it is perhaps not surprising that an extra unit of charge merits an almost equal and opposite contribution from each .    the key difference between a q - ball induced",
    "phase transition and tunnelling directly to the true vacuum is that a critical q - ball does _ not _ have to form spontaneously .",
    "instead it can grow gradually by accreting charge from its surroundings until it reaches the critical size .",
    "stability is ensured at any stage in this process by charge conservation and , in models where q - balls exist , there are classical solutions for arbitrarily small charges @xcite ( consistent with charge quantisation ) .",
    "the solutions are expected to be resilient to quantum fluctuations above a charge of about seven @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown that one can start from a small q - ball and gradually build up the charge through `` solitosynthesis '' , where the accretion is facilitated by a chain of reactions in thermal equilibrium _",

    "one requires that the freeze out temperature of the accretion reactions , @xmath40 , is less than the temperature at which the critical q - ball population explodes , @xmath41 .",
    "links in the chain involving q - balls typically have a large cross section ( about the physical size of the q - ball ) so the process is limited by the reactions keeping the @xmath4 s in equilibrium . hence @xmath40 is the freeze out temperature of the @xmath4 s , whereupon general thermodynamical arguments lead to t_f where @xmath42 is the cross section for the annihilation of @xmath4 s to light particles .",

    "the charge asymmetry is expected to be small so the @xmath45 term dominates the denominator whereas the derivative term has been set to zero owing to the reasons presented earlier .    enforcing the inequality",
    "@xmath46 thus collapses to a bound on the charge asymmetry [ eq : qbetalim ] > .",
    "even if the overall charge of the universe is zero , there will always be a statistical contribution to @xmath43 over a finite region of space . in a comoving volume @xmath47",

    "this is large enough to support critical q - balls all the way down to the freeze out temperature in any volume v<(m_plm_)^2~^9/2 .",
    "if a critical q - ball comfortably fits into this volume , i.e.[eq : qbvclim ] v_c^9/2 statistical fluctuations alone are enough to seed their formation .",
    "physically , one expects to form equal numbers of critical q - balls carrying both positive and negative charge by this approach .",
    "as they destabilise and expand , their boundaries inevitably collide and the net charge is annihilated when the system relaxes to the true vacuum .    the final obstacle to solitosynthesis is the presence of light , charged fermions or vector bosons .",
    "if these exist , they will absorb any charge instead of the q - balls and solitosynthesis will not take place . since all charged scalars are automatically massive enough not to encroach on critical q - ball formation , it is sufficient to check that none of the charged fermions and vector bosons in equilibrium at @xmath41 are lighter than the lightest charged scalar . assuming this and all other conditions are met , the time at which the phase transition happens can be estimated via the hubble time scale at the critical temperature : [ eq : qbtc ] t_c~~^2 for the minimal required charge asymmetry . ignoring the log term , this would demand a scalar mass less than @xmath52 gev for @xmath53 to be less than the age of the universe , @xmath54 years .    .",

    "the interior of the q - ball is stable in all directions and roughly coincides with the true vacuum , where the corresponding u(1 ) symmetry is necessarily broken . a more subtle variation that can occur when the model contains multiple fields is _ indirect _ decay .",
    "even if the u(1 ) symmetry persists in the true vacuum there is always a finite region around it where the symmetry is broken yet the potential remains negative .",
    "such a region can support q - ball solutions that quickly decay to the true vacuum once the phase transition has taken place .",
    "in other words , q - balls can do the hard work of tunnelling through the potential barrier after which the model quickly completes the transition of its own accord .    in summary , q - balls",
    "generically lead to vacuum decay in models of massive scalar fields where the metastable vacuum supports an unbroken , global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "the main barriers to decay are cosmological : either the reactions responsible freeze out before critical q - balls become important or light fermions / vector boson absorb charge in place of q - balls .",
    "the former does not occur if the charge asymmetry satisfies eq .  ,",
    "the latter if any charged fermions or vector bosons are heavier than the lightest charged scalar .",
    "furthermore if eq .",
    "is true , statistical fluctuations in the charge asymmetry can seed critical q - balls . regardless , the lifetime of the metastable vacuum is given by eq .  .",
    "these results are readily generalised to models with multiple scalar fields using ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is now possible to apply these ideas to some popular models of metastable susy breaking and search for instances of solitonic susy restoration ( ssr ) .",

    "note that the explicit mass term precludes the possibility of the model having an @xmath2-symmetry .",

    "the remaining @xmath55-terms are set to zero by choosing |vac_+:_+=0,_+=0 whereas the vev of @xmath56 , fixed at some value @xmath65 , is determined by the details of the susy breaking sector .",

    "@xmath56 is the goldstino superfield ( models where the goldstino is a linear combination involving other fields will be discussed later ) so its scalar component is a classical flat direction , or pseudo - modulus @xcite .",
    "hence the vev of @xmath56 can be chosen at will without affecting the tree level potential and one finds an additional , supersymmetric minimum at |vac_0:_0_0=-f , x_0=-m , u_0=-f^2 .",
    "of course , for the susy breaking vacuum to be locally stable the scalar component of @xmath56 must be stabilised by a mass term arising from loop corrections .",

    "the above model has all the ingredients for ssr ; a metastable vacuum with an unbroken u(1 ) symmetry , charged scalar fields and a supersymmetric vacuum where the symmetry is broken .",
    "however , before formally reaching any conclusion it must be checked that q - balls can be built up via solitosynthesis ( i.e.  there are no light charged fermions or vector bosons and the messengers remain in thermal equilibrium ) and that the critical q - ball formation temperature @xmath41 is greater than the freeze out temperature of the messengers @xmath40 ( i.e.  eq .   is satisfied ) .",

    "the relative scalar potential is calculated from eq .   and goes like u ( ) & ~ & nh^2m^4 - 2n_fh^(n_f+n)/nm^2^(3n - n_f)/n^(n_f - n)/n+ + & & n_fh^2n_f / n^2(3n - n_f)/n^2(n_f - n)/n .",
    "it is negative for a range of @xmath106 with similar magnitudes to @xmath107 , and baryon number is broken whenever the @xmath108 s are non - zero . hence q - ball solutions will occur along @xmath108 directions with interior values of order @xmath107 .",
    "solitosynthesis is unimpeded if @xmath109 such that the charged gauge bosons are not lighter than their scalar counterparts .",
    "all charged fermions already satisfy this constraint as their masses are equal to those of the scalars at @xmath101 .",
    "the only thing left to check is whether eq",
    ".   holds , such that statistical fluctuations in the charge asymmetry are capable of seeding critical q - balls .",
    "one must first decide whether to work in the thin or thick wall limit for the purposes of calculating the critical volume .",
    "since the charged scalars have masses @xmath101 and the metastable vacuum energy is order @xmath110 ( recall , @xmath84 is a perturbative coupling constant ) the vacua are highly non - degenerate and the thick wall approximation is most suitable . once again the scalars are kept in equilibrium through standard model gauge interactions so @xmath111 and , using the critical volume given in eq .   with @xmath112 , eq .   is satisfied unless [ eq : issfincons ]",
    "the result is , in fact , identical to that found for large susy breaking in minimal gauge mediation but with a messenger mass @xmath101 .",
    "this is of course due to the fact that direct mediation in the iss model is a specific example of gauge mediation ",
    "the @xmath113 s and @xmath108 s act as messengers and their masses are @xmath101 .",
    "the conclusions reached in the previous section thus hold here ; any realistic choice of @xmath101 ( i.e.  less than about @xmath114 ) results in ssr on a timescale much less than the age of the universe .    in summary",
    ", ssr occurs in models of direct mediation using an iss susy breaking sector , unless @xmath3 where @xmath115 is the standard model gauge coupling and @xmath84 a perturbative coupling constant .",
    "it does not occur when the goldstone bosons in the metastable vacuum corresponding to broken flavour symmetries remain massless , but any mechanism or deformation that gives them a mass would yield similar results .",
    "the phase transition takes place at time t_c~^2 which is again much less than the age of the universe unless @xmath101 is extremely small ( and well into the observable range ) .",
    "q - balls induce vacuum decay in a large class of models , and those of metastable susy breaking are no exception .",
    "so long as the metastable vacuum has an unbroken , global u(1 ) symmetry and no massless , charged scalars q - balls always exist , with negative interior potential for a sufficiently large charge . after reaching a critical charge ,",
    "they precipitate a phase transition to the supersymmetric vacuum regardless of whether or not the u(1 ) symmetry is preserved there . in the absence of light charged fermions or vector bosons , and if the scalars remain in thermal equilibrium , these critical q - balls are able to build up gradually via solitosynthesis and are stable throughout the process due to charge conservation . furthermore , there is a range of parameter space where critical q - balls can be seeded by statistical charge fluctuations alone so no overall charge asymmetry is required . in order to calculate this range one must decide whether to work in the thick or thin wall approximation , depending on whether the scale of susy breaking is comparable to or much less than the charged scalar masses respectively . having done so , the timescale of vacuum decay can easily be estimated and is almost always much less than the age of the universe .",
    "these ideas have been applied to models of gauge mediation , where messenger number plays the role of the global u(1 ) symmetry , and direct mediation in the iss model , where one can use baryon number . in both cases , solitonic susy restoration occurs . any messenger mass less than @xmath0 gev results in vacuum decay with no net charge asymmetry in the minimal model of gauge mediation , with non - minimal models yielding similar ( but model dependent ) constraints . on the other hand messengers lighter than about 3 tev",
    "are expected to overclose the universe , presenting a serious model building challenge . in the iss model ,",
    "ssr is dependent on the goldstone bosons charged under baryon number getting a large enough mass .",
    "direct mediation results in them being eaten by gauge bosons , that acquire a mass proportional to the standard model gauge couplings . unless the gauge couplings are smaller than the perturbative coupling in the superpotential ( @xmath3 ) solitosynthesis , ergo ssr , are unimpeded .",
    "the simplest way to build long lived models of metastable susy breaking is to ensure that the spectrum contains massless charged scalars or charged fermions lighter than the lightest charged scalar .",
    "@xmath2-symmetries , for example , always meet this condition due to the massless goldstino that is associated with susy breaking .",
    "meanwhile the vanilla iss model is also safe , as there are massless scalars with non - zero baryon number in the metastable vacuum which prevent the formation of q - balls .",
    "alternatively one could search for models of susy breaking with no unbroken u(1 ) symmetries at all , although even then one would have to check whether non - topological solitons corresponding to non - abelian symmetries resulted in ssr .",
    "otherwise ssr is avoided by ensuring that there is no net charge asymmetry in the universe , and that statistical charge fluctuations are insufficient to build critical q - balls .",
    "it should be noted that the analysis assumes a reheat temperature greater than @xmath116 .",
    "another way to evade these conclusions is to not reheat to this temperature but then , since in all reasonable models @xmath117 , it would no longer be possible for thermal effects to drive the theory to the metastable minimum @xcite .",
    "ultimately the task of building a viable model of metastable susy breaking now seems even more daunting .",
    "indeed , many existing models that appear to have long lived vacua are likely to be destabilised once q - balls have been taken into account .",
    "fortunately all is not lost .",
    "it is clear how ssr can be avoided , providing a concrete guide for future model building endeavours .",
