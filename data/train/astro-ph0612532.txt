    "supernovae of type ia ( sn  ia ) play an important role in the study of cosmic evolution .",
    "they are regarded as the best standard candles for the determination of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the nature of their progenitors is still under debate .",
    "there is general consensus that only the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf ( wd ) is compatible with the observed features of sn  ia .",
    "a white dwarf has to accrete mass from a close companion to reach the chandrasekhar limit of @xmath8 .",
    "two main scenarios of mass transfer are currently under discussion . in the so - called single degenerate ( sd )",
    "scenario @xcite , the mass donating component is a red giant / subgiant , which fills its roche lobe and is continually transfering mass to the white dwarf . according to the so - called double degenerate ( dd ) scenario @xcite",
    "the mass donating companion is a white dwarf , which eventually merges with the primary due to orbital shrinkage caused by gravitational wave radiation .",
    "kpd  1930 + 2752 was identified as a pulsating subdwarf b star ( sdbv ) .",
    "multiperiodic variations with short periods and low amplitudes were detected .",
    "in addition to these pulsations a strong variation at a much longer period of about @xmath9 was found .",
    "this variation could be identified as an ellipsoidal deformation of the sdb star most likely caused by a massive companion .",
    "@xcite predicted the period of the binary to be two times the period of this brightness variation .",
    "this was proven by @xcite , who measured a radial velocity curve of kpd  1930 + 2752 which matched the proper period . the radial velocity amplitude combined with an assumption of the canonical mass for sdb stars @xmath10 led to a lower limit for the mass of the system derived from the mass function .",
    "this lower limit @xmath11 exceeded the chandrasekhar mass of @xmath12 .",
    "the system is considered to become double degenerate when the subdwarf eventually evolves to a white dwarf .",
    "orbital shrinkage caused by gravitational wave radiation will lead to a merger of the binary .",
    "maxted et al .",
    "concluded that kpd  1930 + 2752 could be a good candidate for the progenitor of a type ia supernova . +",
    "this conclusion rests on the assumption that the mass of the primary is @xmath13 .",
    "sdb stars have been identified as core helium burning stars at the blue end of the horizontal branch ( extreme horizontal branch , ehb ) . according to canonical stellar evolution",
    "the mass is fixed by the onset of the core helium flash to about half a solar mass @xcite .",
    "however , binary population synthesis calculations @xcite suggest , that the mass range for sdb stars is much wider , ranging from @xmath1 to more than @xmath2 . therefore we aim at measuring the mass of the sdb star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf . since the rotation of the sdb star",
    "is tidally locked to the orbit the inclination of the system can be constrained if the sdb radius and the projected rotational velocity can be measured with high precision .",
    "an analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the light curve allows to tighten the constraints derived from spectroscopy .",
    "we derive the mass - radius relation for the sdb star from a quantitative spectral analysis .",
    "the projected rotational velocity is determined for the first time from high - resolution spectra .",
    "in addition a reanalysis of the published light curve is performed .",
    "with the @xmath14 keck i telescope at the mauna kea observatory two hundred high - resolution spectra were obtained using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) .",
    "two spectra were taken with the eso very large telescope ut2 ( kueyen ) equipped with the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "additional 150 low - resolution spectra were obtained with the @xmath15 telescope at the calar alto observatory using the calar alto faint object spectrograph ( cafos ) . + the data was reduced using the eso - midas package .",
    "the radial velocities were obtained by cross correlation with a model spectrum at rest wavelength . combining with data from literature we derive : @xmath16 , @xmath17 . + for the analysis of the spectra of kpd  1930 + 2752 we used lte model grids for 10 times solar metallicity .",
    "as the surface gravity is of utmost importance for our analysis we also calculated new grids of models and synthetic spectra to account for nlte effects and metal line blanketing simultaneously .",
    "the mean parameter values from the model atmosphere fits are : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "+ the primary aim of the high - resolution time - series spectroscopy was to measure the projected rotational velocity of kpd  1930 + 2752 as accurately as possible . for this purpose",
    "the spectra obtained with hires and uves were used .",
    "the projected rotational velocity was measured by convolving a synthetic spectrum calculated from the best fit model atmosphere with a rotational broadening ellipse for appropriate @xmath20 ( see figure above ) .",
    "the result is very accurate : @xmath21",
    "kpd  1930 + 2752 is obviously affected by the gravitional forces of the companion , demonstrated by its ellipsoidal deformation .",
    "since the period of the photometric variations is exactly half the period of the radial velocity variations the rotation of the sdb star is tidally locked to the orbit .",
    "having determined the gravity and projected rotational velocity , we have three equations at hand that constrain the system , with the sdb mass @xmath22 being the only free parameter . besides the mass function @xmath23 these are @xmath24 with @xmath25 obtained from the model atmosphere analysis , the radius of the star @xmath26 was calculated using the standard mass - radius relation ( eq .",
    "3 ) . together with the orbital period of the system @xmath27 and the projected rotational velocity @xmath28 the inclination of the system",
    "@xmath29 was derived for different values of the sdb mass .",
    "because the rotation is tidally locked to the orbit , the rotational period of the sdb equals the orbital period of the system .",
    "therefore the absolute value of the rotational velocity could be calculated . from the measured projected rotational velocity",
    "the inclination of the system follows ( eq .",
    "2 ) . with the sdb mass as free parameter",
    ", the measured radial velocity semiamplitude @xmath30 and orbital period @xmath27 the mass function was solved numerically ( eq . [ massfunk ] ) to derive the mass of the companion @xmath31 and calculate the total mass of the binary .",
    "the fact that @xmath29 can not exceed unity gave a lower limit for the mass of the sdb @xmath32 .",
    "the total mass of the system exceeds the chandrasekhar limit for almost all assumptions of @xmath22 .",
    "the inclination angle of the system is close to @xmath33 implying that kpd  1930 + 2752 may be an eclipsing binary .",
    "the light curve obtained by @xcite shows ellipsoidal variations . we used this information to further constrain the parameters of the kpd  1930 + 2752 system .",
    "we employed the light curve synthesis and solution code moro which is based on the model by @xcite .",
    "a very fine grid of synthetic light curves was constructed , containing more than 76000 parameter combinations .",
    "indeed , a significant overlap between the spectroscopically determined parameter range and a set of very good light curve fits could be found .",
    "most notable is the coincidence of the best fits with the region of eclipse ( @xmath34 ) ( see fig . [ fig ] ) .",
    "if we combine the results of the photometric analysis with the mass - inclination relation derived from spectroscopy , the sdb mass is constrained to a very narrow range of @xmath35 , corresponding to a total mass of @xmath36 ( cf .",
