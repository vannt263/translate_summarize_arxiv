    "their generalisation to @xmath1-dimensional problems has appeared already in  @xcite , where the related notion of _ ramified space _ has been proposed .",
    "having in mind applications to quantum graphs , kuchment has proposed in  @xcite a class of coupled , time - independent boundary conditions for @xmath2-dimensional elliptic systems .",
    "kuchment s formalism allows for a very efficient variational approach , but the tradeoff is that his boundary conditions are only a proper subset of those considered in  @xcite  or , in the specific context of quantum graphs , in  @xcite .",
    "however , it is remarkable that kuchment s conditions give rise exactly to _ all self - adjoint realisations _ of the schrdinger operator on a metric graph , under a mild locality assumption .    in the companion paper",
    "@xcite , cardanobile and the author have generalized kuchment s formalism to the case of @xmath1-dimensional vector - valued diffusion and characterized several properties of the parabolic problem in dependence on the chosen boundary conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide the extension of the theory in  @xcite to the case of _ dynamic _ boundary conditions of wentzell  robin - type .",
    "although we are soon going to consider the general case , let us start by briefly focusing on the @xmath2-dimensional setting of _ networks _ ( or _ quantum graphs _ ) .",
    "[ firstexa ] let @xmath3 and consider the prototypical case of a diffusion problem @xmath4 on a metric graph  more precisely , on a semi - infinite star with @xmath5 edges @xmath6 on whose center a dynamic kirchhoff - type boundary condition is imposed along with a standard continuity assumption .",
    "each edge is parametrized as a @xmath7-interval , where @xmath8 is identified as the center of the star . therefore , the function @xmath9 describing the diffusion on the edge @xmath10 maps @xmath11 to @xmath12 , while @xmath13 describes the time evolution of the common boundary value in the center .",
    "it is known that the associated initial value problem is well - posed , as discussed , e.g. in  @xcite .",

    "if instead @xmath55 , then @xmath52 reduces to a heat equation with dirichlet boundary conditions . for @xmath53 , these are the only possible choices for @xmath35 , but for @xmath56 we have infinitely many new boundary conditions that in some sense interpolate between dirichlet and wentzell  robin ones .",

    "as already mentioned , the general case of a diffusion equation equipped with coupled ( either dynamic or time - independent ) boundary conditions is mostly motivated by the theories of quantum graphs and parabolic network equations , but it also appears in higher dimensional applications , in particular in biomathematical models ",

    "we restrict to the case of dynamic boundary conditions only . however ,",
    "the general case of mixed dynamic / time - independent boundary conditions ( typically appearing in models from the applied sciences , see e.g.  @xcite ) can be easily treated combining the results presented here and those from  @xcite .    in section  [ prelim ]",

    "the above examples suggest that the vector - valued setting  although equivalent to the that based on a network ( or ramified space ) formalism  is more efficient .",
    "in fact , its flexibility allows to simply introduce whole families of spaces @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , completely new questions arise .",
    "for example , one may wonder how the solution to the heat equation with boundary conditions as in @xmath52 depends on @xmath35 : it will be shown in theorem  [ olafrev ] that this dependence is continuous in norm under very natural assumptions .",
    "this result is interesting in that it does not have a scalar - valued _",

    "we consider invariance of order intervals and subspaces in section  [ posdom ] , showing in particular a tight relation beween the properties of the heat semigroup governing the problem with time - independent ( i.e. , robin - type vector - valued ) boundary conditions and its dynamic counterpart .",
    "we will observe some unexpected phenomena : e.g. , the semigroups governing these diffusion problems are in general not submarkovian  not even positivity preserving .    to discuss these behaviours in detail , in section  [ examplesect ] we focus on the setting of example  [ firstexa ] .",
    "it turns out that even in the simple context of diffusion on a semi - infinite star with finitely many edges , unexpected dynamics arises after chosing appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "finally , in section  [ dynneum ] we briefly discuss the general properties of a similar but different kind of dynamic boundary condition , where the normal derivative  rather than the trace  undergoes a time evolution .",

    "in particular , a submarkovian semigroup is generated _ exactly _ in the following five cases :    * with uncoupled dirichlet / dirichlet boundary conditions , * with uncoupled neumann / neumann boundary conditions , * with uncoupled dirichlet / neumann boundary conditions , * with uncoupled neumann / dirichlet boundary conditions and finally * with kirchhoff boundary conditions .",
    "similarly , we can consider general boundary conditions defined by @xmath2-dimensional subspaces of @xmath30 for a semi - infinite star with @xmath470 edges ( @xmath471 ) .",
    "they can be investigated by means of spherical boundary conditions , i.e. , considering spaces @xmath472 that are ranges of the orthogonal projections @xmath473 analysing the behaviour of @xmath474 in dependence of @xmath475 as done above for @xmath457 is less elementary .",
    "while the matrix is clearly positive if and only if @xmath476\\cup[\\pi,\\frac{3\\pi}{2}]$ ] , it is not clear how to determine all the values @xmath475 leading to @xmath0-contractivity , i.e. , all the values @xmath475 such that the three functions @xmath477 are simultaneously",
    "@xmath478 , corresponding to the three conditions for @xmath0-contractivity associated with the three rows of the matrix @xmath474 in  .     + figure 2afigure 2b    in figure  2a we have plotted , too . on the @xmath462-axis ( horizontal )",
    "we have highlighted the values @xmath479 , @xmath480 , @xmath481 and @xmath482 . on the @xmath483-axis ( vertical ) we have highlighted the values @xmath484 , @xmath485 and @xmath486 . ] the level lines of the above functions for the value @xmath2 ( in violet , blue and red , respectively ) .",
    "this suggests that the ten parameter choices +    * @xmath487 , * @xmath488 , * @xmath489 , * @xmath490 .",
    "* @xmath491 , * @xmath492 , * @xmath493 , * @xmath494 , * @xmath495 , * @xmath496 ,     + lead to an @xmath0-contractive semigroup  as in fact can be checked directly .",
    "observe that @xmath497 identifies kirchhoff boundary conditions if and only if @xmath498 i.e. , if and only if @xmath499 and @xmath500 .",
    "a direct computation shows that the remaining nine cases correspond to boundary conditions defined by means of spaces @xmath152 given by @xmath501 @xmath502 @xmath503 while the last six subspaces only describe some decoupling of any of the three edges , we can not find any physical interpretation for the first three boundary conditions .",
    "one can see that analogous boundary conditions give rise to @xmath0-contractive semigroups also in higher dimensional spaces @xmath48 for any @xmath3 .",
    "it ought to be remarked that not all relevant values become evident through the above plot : one can see that decoupled boundary conditions arise with @xmath504 and @xmath505 for all @xmath506 as well as with @xmath507 and @xmath508 for all @xmath509 .",
    "hence , using again the computations performed in the case of @xmath450 , we see that @xmath505 lead to @xmath0-contractivity for @xmath510 , and so do @xmath507 and @xmath508 for @xmath511 as well as @xmath504 for all @xmath512 .",
    "we do not know whether further pairs @xmath513 leading to @xmath0-contractivity exist .",
    "moreover , a straightforward computation shows that @xmath474 is a positive matrix if and only if @xmath514\\times [ 0 , \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ ] .",
    "again , kirchhoff boundary conditions are a singularity in a `` sea '' of non - submarkovian behaviours .",
    "a similar procedure identifies all the @xmath515-dimensional subspaces of @xmath516 , i.e. , all ranges of the matrices @xmath517 , @xmath518 .",
    "however , plotting the level lines of the corresponding three functions ( as we have done in figure 2b in violet , blue and red , respectively ) , does not suggest any new pairs @xmath513 that lead to @xmath0-contractivity .",
    "the general case of a semi - infinite star with arbitrarily ( finitely ) many edges can be treated likewise , using known formulae for hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "as already remarked , the above results carry over to case of dynamic boundary conditions and should be compared with the known properties of the heat equation with wentzell  robin boundary conditions in the scalar case , cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "in this section we consider a different setting by discussing a new kind of dynamics on the boundary .",
    "while the dynamic boundary conditions introduced in @xmath68 involve the trace , dynamic boundary conditions _ on the normal derivative _ have also been considered in the literature , although less commonly ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the similar but different abstract initial - boundary value problem @xmath519 can be studied for @xmath106 and @xmath520 .",
    "the parameter @xmath521 will be shown to influence the behaviour of the solutions to @xmath522 in a curious way .",
    "consider a sesquilinear form @xmath523 defined by @xmath524 with dense domain @xmath525 where @xmath526 if @xmath527 or @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "mimicking the proof of theorem  [ formdir ] we deduce a corresponding generation result ( cf . also the discussion in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  4.3 ) ) .",
    "[ formneu ] for any @xmath106 , @xmath521 and @xmath117 the sesquilinear form @xmath528 is continuous and elliptic ( with respect to @xmath102 ) .",
    "the operator @xmath529 associated with @xmath530 generates an analytic semigroup @xmath531 on @xmath102 with angle @xmath485 .",
    "the semigroup is compact if and only if @xmath104 have finite measure , provided that @xmath30 is finite dimensional .",
    "moreover , @xmath528 is accretive if @xmath532 and @xmath103 is accretive ; it is symmetric if and only if @xmath533 and @xmath205 is self - adjoint . in these cases",
    "the semigroups is contractive and self - adjoint , respectively .",
