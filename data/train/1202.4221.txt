    "experimental study of multiparticle production in high - energy hadronic ( proton - proton , @xmath1 or proton - antiproton , @xmath2 ) collisions has reached a new high , in terms of energy , at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite",
    ". a fast growth in energy of collisions could be possible due to significant advancement of collider technology in the last few decades . from tens of gev @xcite at intersecting storage ring ( isr ) , hundreds of gev @xcite at super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , both at cern , finally the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath0 ) of collisions has reached thousands of gev first at tevatron at fermilab @xcite and then at lhc at cern @xcite . remarkably , for this wide range of collision energy , the two - parameter negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) function , as given below in eq . - ( 1 ) , played major role in describing multiplicity distributions of produced charged particles .",
    "@xmath3^n \\times \\left[\\frac{k}{k+\\langle n \\rangle}\\right]^k    p(n,\\langle n \\rangle , k ) = \\frac{\\gamma(k+n)}{\\gamma ( k)\\gamma(n+1)}\\left[\\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{k+\\langle n \\rangle}\\right]^n \\times \\left[\\frac{k}{k+\\langle n \\rangle}\\right]^k\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the average multiplicity and the parameter @xmath5 is related to dispersion @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 ) by @xmath8 the charged particle multiplicity distributions in @xmath1 collisions at the isr energies and in @xmath2 collisions at @xmath0 = 540 gev at the sps , fit with nbd function satisfactorily in the full pseudorapidity , @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 is the polar angle of the particle with respect to the counterclockwise beam direction ) space as well as in limited pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "but , at @xmath0= 900 gev sps energy , a single nbd function could describe the data only for small pseudorapidity intervals at the mid - rapidity region , while for larger intervals , where shoulder - like structure appeared in the multiplicity distribution , a single nbd function turned out to be inadequate .",
    "appearance of sub - structures in multiplicity distributions at higher energies and in larger pseudorapidity intervals has been attributed @xcite to weighted superposition or convolution of more than one functions representing more than one source or process of particle productions .",
    "such sub - structure in sps data at @xmath12 900 gev and in tevatron data at @xmath12 1.8 tev could be well explained by weighted superposition of two nbd functions @xcite .",
    "the nbd is quite pertinent for @xmath1 collisions at energies available at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) also , as has been reported @xcite first by a large ion collider experiment ( alice ) .",
    "the study of high - energy particle collisions in pre - lhc energy - range , where soft processes of particle productions dominate , barring application of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) , depends mostly on phenomenological models .",
    "many of these models @xcite , which deal with multiplicity distributions of produced particles , interpret matching of various data of multiplicity distributions involving nbd function well within respective framework . sometimes , the @xmath5-parameter in nbd has very different meanings in some of these so far successful approaches indicating that the very wide occurrences of nbd in high energy experiments is not yet a well understood phenomenon . in the given scenario ,",
    "a detailed study of multiplicity distribution data of @xmath1 collisions at new lhc energies in terms of nbd would be worth carrying out for better understanding of the role of nbd in multiparticle production .",
    "at lhc , multiplicity distributions in proton - proton collisions at center - of - mass energies @xmath0 = 0.9 , 2.36 and 7 tev have been measured by different experiments , in different kinematic ranges and for different classes of events .",
    "all these lhc - experiments find that the mean multiplicities at the new lhc energies ( @xmath0= 2.36 and 7 tev ) had been underestimated by the event generators ( like pythia , phojet etc . ) in use .",
    "the alice has measured primary charged particles at @xmath0 = 0.9 and 2.36 tev in the mid-@xmath9 region in three limited overlapping @xmath9-intervals @xmath13 = 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.3 @xcite , in non - single diffractive ( nsd ) inelastic proton - proton collisions . at @xmath0 = 7 tev , instead of nsd inelastic events , alice analyzed @xcite an event class requiring at least one charged particle in @xmath14 and measured multiplicity distribution in that @xmath9-interval only .",
    "the distributions measured by alice in the three @xmath15-intervals , @xmath13 = 0.5 , 1.0 and 1.3 , at the two energies , @xmath16 tev , @xmath17 tev have been reported @xcite to match fairly well with nbd .",
    "the nbd fit to the distribution at @xmath0= 7 tev , measured by alice , has been reported @xcite to be slightly underestimating the data at low multiplicity ( @xmath18 ) and slightly overestimating the data at high multiplicity ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment has measured primary charged hadrons for all the three lhc energies in non - single diffractive ( nsd ) inelastic proton - proton collisions in the mid-@xmath20 region in five overlapping @xmath9-intervals @xmath13 = 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 and 2.4 @xcite around the center - of - mass pseudorapidity ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the cms experiment did not fit the distributions with nbd or other distribution functions but reported a change of slope in @xmath22 for @xmath23 in its largest @xmath9-interval , @xmath24 .",
    "this feature becomes more pronounced with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "a toroidal lhc apparatus ( atlas ) experiment has measured @xcite charged particle multiplicities for different event classes characterized by different lower cuts on the number of charged particles ( @xmath26 , 2 and 6 ) in different kinematic ranges ( @xmath27 100 mev , 500 mev in @xmath282.5 ) .",
    "in contrast to alice , cms and atlas experiments , which measured multiplicity distributions in the central region in pseudorapidity , the large hadron collider beauty ( lhcb ) experiment at lhc has its detector with geometrical acceptance limited in the forward region . the lhcb experiment has analyzed multiplicity distributions for hard interaction events ( at least one long track with transverse momentum , @xmath29 1 gev / c ) from @xmath1 interactions at @xmath0= 7 tev in non - overlapping pseudorapidity bins of width @xmath28 0.5 in the pseudorapidity range 2.5 @xmath30 4.5 .",
    "it is important to note , at this point , that a few of the phenomenological models have already been contrasted with the lhc data . to explain the appearance of sub - structure in the distribution , the set of cms data of charged hadron multiplicity has been analyzed @xcite in the framework of independent pair parton interaction ( ippi ) @xcite which shows that the number of soft pair parton interactions from colliding particles and so the density of the partonic medium is large for the lhc data and increases with energy . within the framework of the ippi model , the findings favor enlarged role of collective effects in @xmath1 collisions at lhc .",
    "similar conclusion is obtained @xcite from analysis of the data in terms of quark gluon string model ( qgsm ) @xcite that fits better to the data than the ippi model .",
    "another attempt @xcite to describe the multiplicity distribution data at the new lhc energies has been in terms of a two - component model in quantum statistical approach @xcite which described hadronic collision data up to @xmath0 = 540 gev .",
    "the model considers convolution of a nbd ( with @xmath5=1 ) function and a poisson distribution ( pd)function representing two components of source of particle productions : a thermally equilibrated chaotic source and another coherent source , respectively .",
    "the study revealed poor agreement between the data and the model .",
    "however , normalized moments of multiplicity distributions for the lhc data have been reproduced @xcite by a model considering measured distribution as superposition of a pd describing particle emission from one source and a nbd describing distribution of other sources .",
    "our objective is a detailed study of multiplicity distributions of proton - proton collisions at available lhc energies in limited pseudorapidity intervals in terms of behavior of the characteristic parameters of nbd with respect to changing width of pseudorapidity interval , @xmath31 and center - of - mass energy , @xmath0 of collision .    of the lhc data , we chose to analyze the data recorded by the cms experiment @xcite , for the reason that , ( a ) contrary to the other lhc experiments , cms experiment has measured multiplicity distributions for all the three lhc energies ( @xmath32 , 2.36 and 7 tev ) , available so far , in similar pseudorapidity intervals @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( five intervals ) and for the same class ( non - single - diffractive or nsd ) of events , facilitating systematic study of dependence on @xmath35 and @xmath0 for same class of events with more data points .",
    "( b ) detailed study of cms data in terms of nbd function is still absent .",
    "( c ) the phenomenological studies @xcite with published data of multiplicity distributions from @xmath36 collisions at lhc energies have primarily dealt with the cms data and analysis of same data by different phenomenological models help comparison of models .",
    "we analyze the multiplicity distribution data first with single nbd function and then extend our study with weighted superposition of two nbd functions @xcite , where single nbd resulted in poor agreement with data . analyzing the data in terms of weighted superposition of two distribution functions",
    "becomes pertinent because of the reported @xcite change in slope or appearance of sub - structure by the cms experiment in multiplicity distribution for @xmath23 in its largest @xmath9-interval , @xmath24 . according to the two - component model of ref.- @xcite , the shoulder - like structure in the multiplicity distribution of hadronic collisions at @xmath0= 0.9 and",
    "1.8 tev could be explained by weighted superposition of two nbds , representing two classes of events , `` semihard - events with minijets or jets '' and `` soft - events without minijets or jets '' .",
    "analysis in terms of weighted superposition of two nbds could be carried out following the formalism @xcite of giovannini and ugoccioni for the lhc data , as has been suggested @xcite by the authors . beside proposing @xcite",
    "the model to describe multiplicity distribution with sub - structure , giovannini and ugoccioni , predicted possible scenarios for structure of the `` soft '' and the `` semihard '' components of particle production in the full phase space in hadronic collisions in the tev energy - range , in terms of the @xmath5-parameters of the two - nbd and the clan parameters @xcite .",
    "the study of multiplicity distribution and the clan structure analysis @xcite in terms of the two - component model was then extended @xcite to the limited pseudorapidity intervals for the situation when analysis in limited phase space is carried out after classification of events into `` soft '' and `` semihard '' , to ensure that the weight factors for the components in the limited phase space remain same as those in the full phase .",
    "the resulting function of the weighted superposition of two nbds is given by : @xmath37 + [ 1 - \\alpha_{soft}(\\sqrt { s } ) ] \\nonumber\\\\   & & p_{n}[\\langle n \\rangle_{semihard}(\\sqrt { s},\\eta_{c}),{k}_{semihard}(\\sqrt { s},\\eta_{c})]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the fraction of `` soft '' events and is a function of @xmath0 only .",
    "the other parameters , functions of both , the @xmath0 and the @xmath35 , have usual meanings as described for eq . - ( 1 ) with suffixes in parameters indicating respective components .    in the discussed model ,",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is constant with energy of hadronic collisions , indicating validity of kno - scaling @xcite for the `` soft '' component . in terms of @xmath40 , for the `` semihard '' component , which is expected to be dominant in the tev energy range of lhc ,",
    "the model proposes three scenarios : 1 ) the `` semihard '' component also follows the kno - scaling , where @xmath40 remains constant with energy 2 ) @xmath40 decreases linearly with increasing energy indicating violation of kno - scaling by the `` semihard '' component and 3 ) a qcd - inspired scenario , where the kno - violation is not as strong as in scenario 2 , @xmath40 starts decreasing with energy but asymptotically tends to a constant value .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the tev energy range has been extrapolated @xcite empirically from the data in the gev energy domain .    by fitting the lhc data with two - nbd function , constrained with the predictions for @xmath41 and @xmath43 as in ref.@xcite",
    ", the parameters related to the `` semihard '' component could be obtained to match with the respective predictions .",
    "but , as the data , available with us for the analysis , contains both the `` soft '' and the `` semihard '' components and there is no published lhc - data , as yet , to analyze the `` soft '' and `` semihard '' sub - samples separately , the parametrization of giovannini and ugoccioni can not be used .    in the context of the superposition of the `` soft '' and the `` semihard '' components , some significant observations @xcite in collider experiments at sps , tevatron and rhic",
    "are worth mentioning .",
    "the analysis @xcite of data of @xmath2 collisions at @xmath0= 630 and 1800 gev by cdf experiment at tevatron , fermilab in two isolated sub - samples of `` soft '' and `` hard '' events revealed invariance of properties of `` soft '' sub - sample as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the energy invariance of dynamical mechanism of inelastic multiparticle production in `` soft '' @xmath1 collisions has been observed @xcite to be valid at @xmath0= 200 gev by the star experiment at rhic , bnl also . a comparative study @xcite of charged particle multiplicities arising from non - single diffractive inelastic hadronic collisions at @xmath0= 30 gev to 1800 gev , including the data at collider energies at @xmath0= 200 gev to 1800 gev in ua5 ( sps ) and e735 ( tevatron ) experiments , revealed that the multiplicity distribution data of collider energies deviate from much discussed kno - scaling @xcite , which satisfactorily explains multiplicity distributions up to the isr energies . the deviation , in the form of a shoulder - like structure apparently appeared in the collider data due to superposition of distribution of particles from some other process , different from the kno producing process , on the top of the kno distribution .",
    "the `` hard '' events in the referred experimental analysis and the `` semihard '' events as termed in the discussed model are essentially similar class of events , involving hard parton - parton scatterings ( due to high momentum transfer ) resulting in qcd jets of high transverse momentum above a certain threshold .    in terms of two - nbd",
    ", we aim to study the energy dependence of the two components of particle production .",
    "our interest lies particularly with the `` soft '' component of particle production in @xmath1 collisions at lhc , in view of the energy invariance of the `` soft '' component observed in collider energies prior to lhc .",
    "we extend the study further to the clan structure analysis @xcite for the two components .",

    "the different behavior of lhc data at small @xmath35-interval may be due to analysis of different class of event samples as compared to star and cdf .",
    "we recollect , the validity of the two component model @xcite of giovannini and ugoccioni for the full phase space was extended @xcite to limited pseudorapidity intervals only after classification of events is carried out in the full phase space , to ensure multiplicity distributions in limited intervals holding same weighting factor as that in the full phase space .",
    "also , both the star and the cdf experiments analyzed isolated `` soft '' and `` hard '' sub - samples of events separately .",
    "but , this work deals with available lhc data sample including both the `` soft '' and the `` semihard '' events for a given @xmath9-interval and attempts to extract contributions of the components by fitting multiplicity distribution data by weighted superposition of two nbds",
    ". a small pseudorapidity interval may not include all the particles of an event and possibility of exclusion of part of an event in the small interval is more for high multiplicity events , which are likely to be abundant at new lhc - energies .",
    "so , the multiplicity distribution of a sample of all events , including the `` soft '' and the `` semihard '' components , in small interval of pseudorapidity may not reflect the same weighting factor for the two - nbd fit as that in the full phase space .",
    "the effect of partial exclusion of an event minimizes with increasing size of phase space . in a large pseudorapidity interval , therefore , the weighting factor of the two - nbd may remain same as that in the full phase space .",
    "nevertheless , application of the formalism of the weighted superposition of two nbds in the analysis of the published multiplicity data of cms reveals significant property of energy invariance of `` soft '' component of particle productions at lhc in the largest available pseudorapidity interval , @xmath462.4 , where shoulder - like structure appear in the multiplicity distributions . at this point , it is important to compare the goodness of the fits to the multiplicity distribution data by a single nbd and by the superposition of two - nbds . to compare the goodness of fits at the considered lhc energies in the pseudorapidity interval , @xmath46 2.4",

    "better agreement of two - nbd with data at @xmath0= 7 tev in all available @xmath35 and at @xmath0 = 0.9 and 2.36 tev in @xmath46 2.4 , motivates us in contrasting the lhc data at tev energies with the clan structure analysis within the framework of the two - component model @xcite .",
    "the discussed two - component model fits in the framework of clan structure analysis @xcite .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that to distinguish different scenarios , one should look at the @xmath47 parameters and related clan structure analysis .",
    "the clan model @xcite is based on cascading process , where particles are emitted from a previously produced particle while the producing particle can change its momentum and quantum numbers during the process , as it happens in case of well known fragmentation and decay processes .",

    "<S> experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have measured multiplicity distributions in proton - proton collisions at a new domain of center - of - mass energy ( @xmath0 ) in limited pseudorapidity intervals . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze multiplicity distribution data of proton - proton collisions at lhc energies as measured by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment in terms of characteristic parameters of the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) function that has played a significant role in describing multiplicity distribution data of particle production in high energy physics experiments , in the pre - lhc energy - range , in various kinds of collisions for a wide range of collision energy and for different kinematic ranges . beside a single nbd </S>",
    "<S> , we apply the formalism of weighted superposition of two nbds to examine if the multiplicity distribution data of cms could be better explained . </S>",
    "<S> the weighted superposition of two nbds indeed explain the distribution data better at the highest available lhc energy and in large interval of phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the two - nbd formalism further reveals that the energy invariance of the multiplicity distribution of the `` soft '' component of particle production in hadronic collisions is valid at lhc also , as it is at rhic and tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the data further in terms of clan parameters in the framework of the two - nbd model . </S>"
