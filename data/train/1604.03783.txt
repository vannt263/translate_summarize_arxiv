    "anderson in his milestone science paper of 1979 @xcite . in brief , emergence occurs when a complex system shows qualitatively different properties then its building blocks .",

    "however , does not seem to have a permanent character . in a wide class of electronic systems , such as semiconducting heterostructures containing a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , physical properties of itinerant electrons are substantially different than properties of free electrons ( or electrons in atoms composing the system ) , and are also highly - tunable upon variation of external electromagnetic fields @xcite . to give some illustration of this tunability",
    ", we only mention that electrons in gaas heterostructures can be usually described by a standard schrdinger equation of quantum mechanics with the effective mass @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the free electron mass ) , whereas in extreme cases of quantum states formed in quantum hall systems , effective quasiparticles may not even show the fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "it is rather rarely noticed that graphene , a two - dimensional form of carbon just one atom tick @xcite , also belongs to the second class of emergent systems ( i.e. , without an apparent spontaneous symmetry breaking ) described briefly above . in a monolayer graphene ,",

    "this observation applies generically to bilayer or multilayer graphenes @xcite , as well as to hgte / cdte quantum wells @xcite , although microscopic models describing such _ other dirac systems _ are slightly different .",
    "it is also worth to mention so - called artificial graphenes , in which waves ( of different kinds ) obey their effective dirac equations @xcite .",
    "a peculiar nature of dirac fermions in graphene originates from the chiral structure of the hamiltonian @xmath17 , accompanied by the fact that coupling to the external electromagnetic field is described by additive terms , which are linear in both scalar and vector potentials .",
    "a remarkable consequence of these facts is the quantization of the visible light absorption @xcite , an unexpected macroscopic quantum effect recently found to have analogs in other dirac systems @xcite , and even in a familiar graphite @xcite .",
    "another intriguing effect of this kind appears for dc conductivity of ballistic graphene @xcite . in the so - called pseudodiffusive transport regime ,",
    "the conductance of a rectangular sample ( with the width @xmath18 and the length @xmath19 ) scales as @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the universal quantum value of the conductivity @xcite , whereas the shot - noise power and all the other charge - transfer characteristics are indistinguishable from those of a classical diffusive conductor regardless the sample shape @xcite . at high magnetic fields ,",
    "the pseudodiffusive charge transport is predicted theoretically to reappear for resonances with landau levels in both monolayer @xcite and bilayer graphene @xcite . in the presence of disorder , a fundamental property of the hamiltonian",
    " the time reversal symmetry ( trs )  starts to play a decisive role .",
    "in particular , effective trs in a single valley may be broken even in the absence of magnetic fields , leading to observable ( and having the universal character ) consequences for the conductance and spectral fluctuations @xcite , as well as for the peculiar scaling behavior predicted for the conductivity @xcite .",
    "although the interest in graphene and other dirac systems primarily focus on their potential applications @xcite , quite often linked to the nonstandard quantum description @xcite , we believe that the fundamental perspective sketched in the above also deserves some attention . in the remaining part of this article , we first overview basic experimental , theoretical and numerical findings concerning signatures of quantum chaos in graphene and its nanostructures ( section  ii ) .",
    "next , we present our new numerical results concerning the additive random matrix model originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe a nonstandard gue - goe transition , accompanied by lifting out the valley degeneracy ( section  iii ) .",
    "the consequences of these findings for prospective experiments on graphene nanoflakes , together with the phase diagram depicting the relevant matrix ensembles in the system size - doping plane , are described in section  iv .",
    "the concluding remarks are given in section  v.",
    "dirac fermions confined in graphene quantum dots @xcite have provided yet another surprising situation , in which a piece of handbook knowledge needed a careful revision @xcite .",
    "quantum chaotic behavior appears generically for systems , whose classical dynamics are chaotic , and manifests itself via the fact that energy levels show statistical fluctuations following those of gaussian ensembles of random matrices @xcite . in particular , if such a system posses the time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) , its spectral statistics follow the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "a system with trs and half - integer spin has the symplectic symmetry and , in turn , shows spectral fluctuations of the gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) .",
    "if trs is broken , as in the presence of nontrivial gauge fields , and the system has no other antiunitary symmetry @xcite , spectral statistics follow the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) . for a particular case of massless spin-1/2 particles , it was pointed out by berry and mondragon @xcite , that the confinement may break trs in a persistent manner ( i.e. , even in the absence of gauge fields ) , leading to the spectral fluctuations of gue .",
    "when applying the above symmetry classification to graphene nanosystems @xcite one needs , however , to take into account that dirac fermions in graphene appear in the two valleys , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , coupled by trs .",
    "( in particular , real magnetic field break trs and has the same sign in the two valleys , whereas the strain - induced gauge field preserves trs and has opposite signs in the two valleys . )",
    "if the valley pseudospin is conserved , a special ( symplectic ) time - reversal symmetry ( strs ) becomes relevant , playing a role of an effective trs in a single valley @xcite .",
    "both real magnetic and strain - induced gauge fields may break strs leading to the spectral fluctuations of gue @xcite . as demonstrated numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , such fluctuations also appear for particular closed nanosystems in graphene in the presence of random scalar potentials slowly varying on the scale of atomic separation .",
    "such nanosystems include equilateral triangles with zigzag or klein edges , i.e. , with terminal atoms belonging to one sublattice .",
    "generic graphene nanoflakes with irregular edges show spectral fluctuations of goe @xcite , as strong intervalley scattering restores trs in the absence of gauge fields ( see fig .",

    "in contrast , the boundary effects are suppressed in open graphene systems , for which signatures of the symplectic symmetry class were reported @xcite .",
    "it is worth mention here , that triangular graphene flakes , similar to studied theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite , have been recently fabricated @xcite .",
    "however , due to the hybridization with metallic substrates , quantum - dot energy levels in such systems are significantly broaden , making it rather difficult to determine the symmetry class via spectral statistics .",
    "additive random - matrix models are capable of reproducing the evolutions of spectral statistics in many cases when a  complex system undergoes transition to quantum chaos or transition between symmetry classes @xcite .",
    "the discussion usually focus on the auxiliary random hamiltonian of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are members of different gaussian ensembles to be a  diagonal random matrix , elements of which follow a  gaussian distribution with zero mean and the variance @xmath26 . ] , and the parameter @xmath27 $ ] .",
