    "for almost two decades the frustrated antiferromagnets cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 have been considered as experimental realizations of a frustrated triangular lattice @xcite .",

    "@xcite [ see fig .",
    "[ crystal ]  ( a ) ] and are characterized by a layered arrangement of cu@xmath4 ions in a triangular pattern parallel to the @xmath5 plane .",
    "the two - dimensional character of magnetic interactions between the spin-@xmath6 cu@xmath4 ions was confirmed by neutron scattering and susceptibility measurements in both systems @xcite and was successfully modeled @xcite by a two - dimensional heisenberg hamiltonian containing an anisotropic interaction term of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya type @xcite .    in spite of their structural similarity , cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1",
    "have rather different magnetic behavior . while in cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1",
    "magnetic excitations are localized and the field dependent magnetization exhibits two well - defined plateaux @xcite , cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 shows fractional spin excitations and spin liquid behavior over a broad temperature range , as revealed in inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the dissimilar behavior between cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 has often been attributed to their unequal degree of frustration , determined as the ratio @xmath7 between the inter - chain exchange coupling @xmath3 and the dominant intra - chain exchange coupling @xmath2 in the underlying triangular lattice [ see figs .",
    "[ crystal ]  ( b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "a ratio of @xmath8  @xcite has been suggested for cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 by comparing the ordering vector of a helical incommensurate structure observed in neutron elastic scattering experiments with the one obtained from inverse temperature series expansions for a spin-@xmath6 heisenberg model on an anisotropic triangular lattice  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , a ratio of @xmath9  @xcite was derived for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 from comparison of spin - wave calculations for the spin-@xmath6 heisenberg model with the magnetic excitation spectrum observed in neutron scattering experiments in the presence of an external magnetic field far above saturation .",
    "these observations indicate that cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 is less frustrated and more one - dimensional than cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 .",
    "while a large amount of work has been devoted to the description of the fractional quantum states and to understanding the phase transitions of the two - dimensional frustrated spin model with spatial anisotropy  @xcite , a detailed comparative analysis of the electronic , magnetic and structural properties of these systems as well as a deep understanding of the origin of the different behavior is still missing .    in this work ,",
    "we present an extensive density functional theory ( dft ) study of the microscopic properties of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 and compare our results with experimental data .",
    "we consider different exchange - correlation functionals in order to also investigate the dependence of the electronic , magnetic and structural properties on these choices .",
    "our study of the performance of different exchange - correlation functionals is motivated by the fact that physical properties of recently discovered high temperature fe - based superconductors are extremely sensitive to the details of dft calculations  @xcite .",
    "also , dft studies of a recently topical layered mott insulator tiocl  @xcite reveals that it is essential to use a suitable exchange - correlation functional in dft calculations to describe correctly the behavior of this system .    out of the electronic structure calculations we derive a tight - binding ( tb ) hamiltonian and",
    "estimate the heisenberg exchange coupling constants between cu ions from total energy calculations .",
    "our dft derived effective models incorporate a larger number of interacting cu neighbors compared to the models used for the experimental data analysis .",
    "we show that some of these terms are crucial for understanding the behavior of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 .",
    "in this paper , we consider the experimentally measured structures of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 as well as internal coordinates obtained from the structural optimization with various exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "the experimentally measured unit cell parameters of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 are taken from ref .   and those of cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 from ref .  .",
    "both structures were measured at room temperature .",
    "crystal structure optimization of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 is required since calculations with the experimentally determined structural parameters find quite large interatomic forces , which indicates that the structures are not in equilibrium within dft .",
    "this holds for the calculations with all the considered exchange - correlation functionals listed below . in all cases ,",
    "the interatomic forces are larger in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 compared to cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 .    based on our structural optimizations",
    ", we will discuss in detail the electronic properties of both compounds .",
    "for the structure optimization we apply the following schemes with different approximations to the exchange - correlation functional within dft and different magnetic configurations : ( 1 ) the spin - independent local density approximation ( lda[nm ] ) @xcite ; ( 2 ) the spin - independent generalized gradient approximation ( gga[nm ] ) @xcite ; ( 3 ) the spin - dependent gga with a ferromagnetic cu spin configuration ( gga[fm ] ) ; ( 4 ) the spin - dependent gga+u  @xcite with a ferromagnetic cu spin configuration ( gga+u[fm ] ) . for the gga+u[fm ]",
    "calculations we considered the around mean field ( amf ) version @xcite with values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the cu ions of 6  ev and 1  ev respectively . the lattice constants , which are assumed to be well determined from experiments , were kept fixed for the structure relaxations while the optimization of the relative atomic positions was constrained by the symmetry of the @xmath12 space group .    for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1",
    ", we also considered two optimization schemes with an antiferromagnetic cu spin configuration : gga[afm ] and gga+u[afm ] ( @xmath13  ev , @xmath14  ev ) .",
    "the spin arrangement in this antiferromagnetic configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ crystal ] ( d ) , where the cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 unit cell was doubled in the @xmath15 direction along the cu chains . in order to produce such an arrangement ,",
    "the symmetry of the supercell was lowered to the space group @xmath16 , with two inequivalent cu atoms .",
    "our choice of this particular antiferromagnetic configuration is due to its resemblance to the experimentally observed 120@xmath17 ground state configuration @xcite .",
    "the considered antiferromagnetic configuration is collinear , which is beneficial in terms of computational effort , and fulfills the requirement that the strongest couplings @xmath2 are satisfied and the second strongest couplings @xmath3 are partially satisfied .",
    "the optimization of the relative atomic positions with the two antiferromagnetic schemes was constrained by the symmetry of the @xmath16 space group .    additionally , for both systems we completed the lda series of structural optimizations with lda[fm ] and lda+u[fm ] optimizations . however , due to the analogous behavior of the structural properties of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 observed within this series with those within the gga series , the detailed analysis of the lda series will be omitted here .        before presenting the structure optimizations with the different exchange - correlation functionals ,",
    "we shall consider the experimental crystal structure and discuss the electronic properties obtained with the different exchange - correlation functionals .",
    "calculations with the gga[nm ] , gga[fm ] or gga+u[fm ] exchange - correlation potentials result in the electronic structure being either gapless ( gga[nm ] ) or gapped ( gga[fm ] and gga+u[fm ] ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap ] . allowing for spin polarization opens a gap in both cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 [ though in the latter compound the gga[fm ] gap is rather small ( @xmath18  ev ) ] . upon introducing the onsite coulomb repulsion within the gga+u[fm ] ,",
    "the gaps in both systems increase considerably [ fig .",
    "[ gap ] ( c ) and ( f ) ] .",
    "spin - dependent exchange - correlation functionals provide a better description of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 electronic properties as these functionals correctly reproduce the experimentally observed insulating ground state of the compounds .",
    "moreover , as it will be shown in the next sections , it turns out that the presence of a band gap is important for the accurate determination of the equilibrium crystal structures .",

    "the two dos s are plotted with opposite signs .",
    "the calculations are performed with the lapw code wien2k [ see section ii ( d ) ] . in the case of gga+u[fm ] , the around mean field scheme is employed , with @xmath13  ev and @xmath19  ev .",
    "the fermi level is set to zero.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      we proceed now with the structural optimization .",
    "the crystal structures of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 resulting after optimization with each of the schemes described above are presented in appendix a. in our analysis of these structures we focus on geometry variations of the cu@xmath20 ( @xmath21 , br ) tetrahedron , which determine the strength of important exchange couplings .    in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 ,",
    "the cu@xmath20 tetrahedron is distorted due to the jahn - teller effect and also due to the steric pressure originating from cs@xmath22 ions  @xcite . the jahn - teller effect results in a squeezing of the tetrahedron such that the @xmath23-cu-@xmath23 bond angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 increase and the @xmath23-cu-@xmath23 bond angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 decrease [ fig .",
    "[ crystal ] ( c ) ] . the steric pressure by cs(2 ) on @xmath23(3 ) causes additional symmetry lowering by increasing @xmath26 and decreasing @xmath25 . in order to compare the strengths of the two types of distortions in different structures",
    ", one can define the jahn - teller deviation @xmath28 as the difference between averages @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and the steric pressure deviations @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath34    as can be seen in appendix a , the cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 structures relaxed with gga[fm ] and gga[afm ] are very close as well as the structures relaxed with gga+u[fm ] and gga+u[afm ] .",
    "the tetrahedron parameters in these structures are also similarly close .",
    "this demonstrates that , within the spin - dependent gga and gga+u , interatomic forces in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 are very weakly dependent on the actual cu spin configuration and in the following we will consider only ferromagnetic spin - dependent relaxation schemes for cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 . this result is a consequence of the rather small energy scale of magnetic interactions between cu spins , which is much smaller than the difference between total energies usually involved in structural relaxations .    in tables",
    "[ tetra_cl ] and [ tetra_br ] , we present the tetrahedron parameters defined above for the experimental and relaxed crystal structures of cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "some of them are additionally shown in fig .  [ str_par ] in order to facilitate the comparison of the different crystal structures . in both compounds , the crystal structures of the gga relaxation series ( gga+u[fm ] , gga[fm ] and gga[nm ] ) are featured by a continuous variation of the @xmath23-cu-@xmath23 angles . in terms of these angles ,",
    "the relaxed crystal structures closest to the experimental structures are the gga+u[fm ] structures for both cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 and cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 . however , in terms of cu-@xmath23 bond distances , represented here as the averaged distance @xmath35 , the gga crystal structures are further away from the experimental structures than the lda structures [ see fig .",
    "[ str_par ]  ( a ) ] . in the lda structures",
    "( including the lda[fm ] and lda+u[fm ] ones , which are not listed in the tables ) , @xmath36 are smaller than the corresponding parameters of the experimental structures , but the difference is less compared to the gga series .",
    "thus , the gga relaxation tends to increase the bond distances in the cu@xmath20 tetrahedron while the lda relaxation decreases them .    in the gga series ,",
    "the jahn - teller - like distortion of the tetrahedron , which we evaluate through @xmath28 , is strongest in the gga[nm ] crystal structures of both compounds and decreases monotonically as the cu magnetic moment in the spin - resolved calculations increases ( gga[fm ] , gga+u[fm ] ) [ see fig .  [ str_par ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "the cu magnetic moment in cs@xmath0cucl@xmath1 calculated with either gga[fm ] or gga[afm ] schemes is 0.50@xmath37 and increases to 0.78@xmath37 when the onsite coulomb interaction is switched on within the gga+u functional ( table  [ tetra_cl ] ) . in cs@xmath0cubr@xmath1 ,",
    "the corresponding values of the cu magnetic moment are 0.42@xmath37 and 0.73@xmath37  @xcite ( table  [ tetra_br ] ) . in the lda[nm ]",

    "<S> we find that the exchange couplings depend on rather subtle details of the structural optimization and that only when the insulating state ( mediated through spin polarization ) is present in the structural optimization , we do have good agreement between the calculated and the experimentally determined exchange couplings . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the effect of interlayer couplings as well as longer - ranged couplings in both systems . </S>"
