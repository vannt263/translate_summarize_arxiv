    "entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical phenomenon in which quantum systems exhibit correlations above and beyond what is possible for classical systems .",
    "entangled systems are thus an important resource for many quantum information processing protocols including quantum computation , quantum metrology , and quantum communication @xcite .",
    "much work has been done with respect to the identification and quantification of entanglement as well as explorations of entanglement evolution under a range of possible dynamics @xcite .",
    "an important area of research is to understand the possible degredation of entanglement under decoherence .",
    "decoherence , unwanted interactions between the system and environment , is the major challenge confronting experimental implementations of quantum computation , metrology , and communication .",
    "decoherence may be especially detrimental to highly non - classical , and hence the most potentially useful , entangled states @xcite .",
    "a manifestation of the detrimental affects of decoherence on entangled states is entanglement sudden death ( esd ) in which entanglement is completely lost in a finite time @xcite despite the fact that the loss of system coherence is asymptotic .",
    "this aspect of entanglement has been well explored in the case of bi - partite systems and there are a number of studies looking at esd in multi - partite systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , there have been several initial experimental esd studies @xcite .",
    "the esd phenomenon is interesting on a fundamental level and important for the general study of entanglement .",
    "however , it is not yet clear what the affect of esd is on quantum information protocols .",
    "are different quantum protocols helped , hurt , or indifferent to esd ?",
    "previous studies along these lines have been in the area of quantum error correction ( qec ) .",
    "an explicit study of the three - qubit phase flip code concludes that this specific code is indifferent to esd @xcite . in this paper",
    "i take a first step in studying the affect of esd on cluster state quantum computational gates .",
    "specifically , i study a four qubit cluster state to see how esd affects its utility as a means of implementing a general single qubit rotation for measurement based ( cluster state ) quantum computation",
    ". my approach will be to use an entanglement witness , the negativity and bi - partite concurrence as entanglement metrics and compare the behavior of these metrics under the influence of decoherence to the fidelity of the final state after the attempted single qubit rotation .",
    "in addition , i will study the entanglement that remains in the cluster state after two measurements and compare it to the fidelity of the state of the two unmeasured qubits .",
    "the cluster state @xcite is a specific type of entangled state that can be used as an initial resource for a measurement based approach to quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a cluster state can be created by first rotating all qubits into the state @xmath0 . desired pairs of qubits",
    "are entangled by applying control phase ( cz ) gates between them . in a graphical picture of a cluster state ,",
    "qubits are represented by circles and pairs of qubits that have been entangled via a cz gate are connected by a line .",
    "a cluster state with qubits arranged in a two - dimensional lattice , such that each qubit has been entangled with four nearest neighbors , suffices for universal qc .    after constructing the cluster state , any quantum computational algorithm",
    "can be implemented using only single - qubit measurements along axes in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane .",
    "these processing measurements are performed by column , from left to right , until only the last column is left unmeasured .",
    "the last column contains the output state of the quantum algorithm which can be extracted by a final readout measurement .",
    "one can view each row of the cluster - state lattice as the evolution of a single logical qubit in time .",
    "two ( logical ) qubit gates are performed via a connection between two rows of the cluster state .",
    "cz gates in particular are ` built - in ' to the cluster state and simple measurement automatically implements the gate .",
    "single qubit rotations can be performed when there is no conncetion between the measured qubit(s ) and qubits in another row .",
    "in such a case the logical gate implemented by measurement along an angle @xmath3 in the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hadamard gate and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ) is a @xmath8- ( @xmath1- ) rotation by an angle @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the logical operation on the outcome of the measurement is manifest in @xmath10 for measurement outcome @xmath11 .",
    "an arbitrary single qubit rotation can be implemented via three logical single - qubit rotations of the above sort yielding @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the euler angles of the rotation .",
    "for example , by drawing the euler angles according to the haar measure , a random single - qubit rotation can be implemented .    as with all quantum computing paradigms , cluster state quantum computation , both during the constuction of the cluster state and during subsequent measurement , are subject to decoherence .",
    "we study a four qubit cluster chain , with no interaction between the qubits ( beyond the initial conditional phase gates used to construct the cluster state ) placed in a dephasing environment fully described by the kraus operators @xmath14 where we have defined the dephasing parameter @xmath15 .",
    "when all four qubits undergo dephasing we have 16 kraus operators each of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "though all of the below calculations are done with respect to @xmath15 , i implicitly assume that @xmath15 increases with time , @xmath19 , at a rate @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 only at infinite times .",
    "for now i also assume equal dephasing for all four qubits .    in optical cluster state construction small ( few qubit )",
    "cluster states are fused together to form larger cluster states @xcite .",
    "the smaller states must be stored until they are needed and may be subject to decohence ( especially dephasing ) . in other cluster state implementations , where complete two - dimensional cluster states can be constructed in just a few steps @xcite , any four qubit chain may be attached to at least one other qubit . in this case",
    "our results may not be exact .    while entanglement is invariant to single qubit operations , decoherence is not and local operations may play a significant role in the entanglement dynamics of the state .",
    "thus , if a cluster state must be stored in a decohering environment one would ideally like to choose a cluster state representation ( within single qubit operations ) that has the greatest immunity to the decoherence so as retain as much entanglement as possible . with this",
    "is mind a secondary aim of this paper is to study two representations of the four qubit chain cluster state and compare the affects of dephasing on these representations .",
    "the first representation of the four qubit cluster state is @xmath23 this representation minimizes the number of computational basis states having non - zero contribution . the second representation is : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the single qubit hadamard gate on qubit @xmath26 .",
    "this is the state one would get by initially rotating each qubit into the state @xmath27 and applying contolled phase gates @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we note that ` connections ' between qubits may be added or removed by single qubit rotations ( though the entanglement stays constant ) thus changing the operation performed via measurement @xcite .",
    "the four qubit cluster has pure four qubit entanglement .",
    "thus , for example , there is no bi - partite concurrence between any of the two qubits . as an entanglement metric",
    "we use the negativity , @xmath31 , for which we will simply use the most negative eigenvalue of the parital transpose of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "there are a number of inequivalent forms of the negativity for the four qubit cluster state : the partial transpose may be taken with respect to any single qubit , @xmath32 , or the partial transpose may be taken with respect to two qubits : qubits 1 and 2 , @xmath33 , qubits 1 and 3 , @xmath34 , or qubits 1 and 4 , @xmath35 .",
    "a further method of monitoring entanglement evolution is via the expectation value of the state with respect to an appropriate entanglement witness @xcite .",
    "entanglement witnesses are observables with positive or zero expectation value for all states not in a specified class and a negative expectation value for at least one state of the specified class .",
    "entanglement witnesses may allow for an efficient means of determining whether entanglement is present in a state ( as opposed to inefficient state tomography ) .",
    "this is especially important for experimental implementations as it may be the only practical means of deciding whether or not sufficient entanglement is present in the system .",

    "first , we have assumed that the intial cluster state is constructed perfectly .",
    "one way to relax this assumption is by looking at intial states of the form : @xmath141 , where @xmath51 .",
    "preliminary explorations using this starting state indicate that there is merely a shift in entanglement values downwards but that there is no fundamental change in the behavior of the entanglement .",
    "another assumption is that the dephasing strength is equal on all four qubits .",
    "this is unrealistic for a number of reasons but especially so if not all of the measurements are performed at the same time ( non - simultaneous measurements are necessary when trying to implement a given logical rotation because the measurement axes for a given qubit depends on the outcome of the measurement on the previous qubit ) .",
    "a way to relax this assumption without significantly increasing the number of variables in the problem may be to add a @xmath142 term to the dephasing strength where @xmath143 represents the dephaing the occurs during the time between subsequent measurements and @xmath92 is an integer .",
    "in conclusion , i have studied the entanglement evolution of a four qubit ( chain ) cluster state in a dephasing environment .",
    "specifically , i have looked at two represenations of the state differing by single qubit rotations . both of these representations exhibit entanglement sudden death under sufficient dephasing .",
    "the difference in the dephasing strength at which this occurs may be important when deciding in what representation to store a cluster state .",
    "the issue of storage is especially relevant during the construction of optical cluster states but may have relevance to other implementations as well .",
    "i asked whether esd affects the utility of the cluster state in implementing a general single qubit rotation in the cluster state measurement based quantum computation paradigm .",
    "judging from the fidelity decay of the single unmeasured qubit as a function of dephasing strength and the measurement axes angles of the three measurements the answer would seem to be no .",
    "i see no indication in the fidelilty behavior that esd has taken place .",
    "instead the fidelity decreases smoothly with increased dephasing with no discontinuities or dramatic changes in behavior . however , there are clear correlations ( sometimes total and sometimes at certain limits ) between the fidelity of the state of two qubits remaining from the four qubit cluster state after measurement on the other two qubits , and esd of the negativity for the entire cluster state or esd of the concurrence between the said two unmeasured qubits",
    ". this correlation does not appear as a discontinuity in the fidelity decay behavior but instead is manifest by the fidelity crossing the critical value of .5 .",
    "thus , we could say that esd may be an _ indicator _ of how badly a certain cluster state operation was carried out . however , this is not the same as saying that esd itself negatively affects quantum information protocols .",
    "the question of whether esd affects quantum information protocols requires further study and may be related to the more general issue of the role of entanglement in quantum computation .",
