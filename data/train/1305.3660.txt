    "the existence of quantum correlations for multipartite separable mixed states can be regarded as one of the most interesting quantum information discoveries of the last decade . in 2001",

    "all other lu action orbits are non - symplectic . moreover , the more non - symplectic is a lu action orbit the more entangled are states belonging to it @xcite .",

    "remarkably , the non - degenerate symplectic structure is present on a generic local unitary orbit through @xmath0 and @xmath1 states rather than separable states .",
    "more precisely , for density matrices defined on @xmath2 we show that the closure of all symplectic @xmath3-orbits is exactly the set of @xmath0 states .",
    "similarly , the closure of all symplectic @xmath4-orbits gives the set of @xmath1 states .",
