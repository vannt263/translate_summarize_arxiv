    "during the last decades , the interplay between string theory , the topological string and supersymmetric gauge theories has led to fascinating developments in mathematics as well as in physics .",
    "for instance , from the mathematical point of view , the observables in topological string theory can usually be understood in terms of topological invariants which acquire a physical meaning in string theory .",
    "indeed , considered as a twisted version of the latter , the topological string captures properties of string theory that depend on its bps sector only and can thus be viewed as a subsector of string theory .    in order to make this connection more precise , consider a calabi - yau compactification of type ii string theory and perform the topological twist on the underlying superconformal algebra ( sca ) , _ i.e. _ shifting the energy - momentum tensor with the @xmath4 current as @xmath5 ( and similarly for the right - movers ) .",
    "the resulting theory can be shown to be topological @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the twisting of the sca can be implemented at genus @xmath6 in type ii through a deformation of its @xmath7-model by the operator @xmath8 , see @xcite , where @xmath9 is the two - dimensional scalar curvature and @xmath10 is the free scalar bosonising @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath12 . by choosing a metric such that @xmath13 , it is easy to see that the partition function in the twisted , topological theory can be calculated in the untwisted , type ii theory as an amplitude involving @xmath14 insertions of vertex operators whose internal part is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is identified as the internal part of the graviphoton vertex operator .",
    "hence , it turns out that the genus @xmath6 topological string partition function @xmath16 computes the coupling coefficients of a class of higher - derivative f - terms in the string effective action at genus @xmath6 @xcite , given by @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the anti - self - dual riemann tensor and @xmath19 the anti - self - dual part of the graviphoton field strength .",
    "they originate from the supersymmetric f - term involving the weyl multiplet @xmath20 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are chiral vector multiplets with scalar component @xmath23 .    from the low - energy perspective ,",
    "one of the uses of topological string theory is to geometrically engineer supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the local @xmath24 model arising from a type iia compactification on an elliptically fibered @xmath25 over @xmath26 , which is used to engineer the @xmath27 , @xmath28 gauge theory of seiberg and witten . the genus zero partition function of this model , @xmath29 , coincides , in the field theory limit , with the prepotential of the supersymmetric gauge theory .",
    "in addition , @xmath30 can be interpreted as gravitational corrections to the seiberg - witten prepotential encoded in the f - terms .",
    "in fact , one can understand these corrections gauge - theoretically through the @xmath27 gauge theory in the @xmath0-background @xcite .",
    "more specifically , it was shown that the seiberg - witten solution can be obtained by a direct path integral evaluation if one introduces an @xmath31-fibration over @xmath32 such that going around the circle is accompanied by rotations in the two @xmath33-planes of space - time and an @xmath34-symmetry rotation parametrised by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the latter is crucial to preserve a fraction of supersymmetry and evaluate the path integral using localisation .",
    "similarly to the seiberg - witten case , the @xmath0-deformed prepotential receives a one - loop correction and a series of instanton contributions only : @xmath37 and its logarithm is known as the nekrasov partition function .",
    "it was shown that in the limit @xmath38 , the leading term in matches the seiberg - witten solution and , for @xmath39 , is the field theory limit of the topological string partition function , with the topological string coupling being identified with the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this opened up the possibility of ` refining ' the topological string through a one - parameter extension of its partition function such that its field theory limit matches the gauge theory partition function in a general @xmath0-background . from the worldsheet point of view of the untwisted theory",
    ", this would correspond in to additional insertions of self - dual field strenghts .",
    "one of the main difficulties in achieving this is to simultaneously realise the @xmath34-symmetry rotation at the worldsheet level using physical operators .",
    "even though the existence of such objects is _ a priori _ not guaranteed , in what follows we show that this is indeed the case by reviewing the results of @xcite .    to date",
    ", most descriptions of the refinement do not follow a worldsheet approach .",
    "for instance , the refined topological partition function can be defined as a bps index in m - theory counting spinning m2-branes @xcite and evaluated using the refined topological vertex techniques @xcite .",
    "similarly to the instanton calculus in gauge theory , the latter is applicable in the asymptotic region of the moduli space only .",
    "a worldsheet realisation of the refined topological string is therefore essential in order to define it at any point in the moduli space . in this perspective",
    ", we consider a ( compact ) calabi - yau compactification of type ii theory admitting a heterotic dual and identify the additional self - dual insertions .",
    "even though we consider the compact calabi - yau case , it is worth mentioning that our primary goal is to identify the full @xmath0-background in a physical string theory setup .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the couplings we calculate define a bps index in type ii theory once the heterotic / type ii duality map is applied and the appropriate non - compact / local limit is taken .    in this note",
    ", we review the class of generalised f - terms extending introduced in @xcite and motivate the identification of the additional insertions .",
    "then , in section [ deformedtopoamp ] , we discuss the evaluation of these couplings and their connection to the gauge theory partition function .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] highlights some of the open questions and directions for future investigation .",
    "consider a five - dimensional @xmath1 gauge theory on @xmath40 and define its partition function as the trace over the four - dimensional hilbert space of the theory@xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fermion number , @xmath43 are the cartan generators of the @xmath44 subgroups the euclidean rotation group @xmath45 of @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the cartan generator of the @xmath28 @xmath34-symmetry and the ` inverse temperature ' @xmath48 is identified with the radius of @xmath31 .",
    "this trace may be equivalently described as a vacuum amplitude on a deformed melvin - like background , @xmath49 , with @xmath22 being the @xmath31 coordinate .",
    "this space , known as the @xmath0-background , is a fibration of @xmath46 over @xmath31 , with the @xmath46-fibre being twisted by isometry operations encoded into two constant rotation parameters @xmath35 , through @xmath50 , with the identification @xmath51 .    in order to motivate the definition of the generalised f - term couplings of @xcite , it is instructive to obtain a deeper understanding of the relation between the string amplitudes @xmath52 and the nekrasov partition function for @xmath53 .",
    "the connections are summarised in the table below . @xmath54",
    "consider the scattering of two gravitons and @xmath14 graviphotons in type ii string theory on a calabi - yau threefold .",
    "this amplitude first appears at genus @xmath6 and , being topological , receives no perturbative or non - perturbative corrections , consistently with @xmath1 super - renormalisation theorems .",
    "let us focus on the perturbative part of the @xmath16 . using type ii - heterotic duality ,",
    "it may be obtained by evaluating a one - loop amplitude of the same coupling in the dual heterotic theory on @xmath55 in the weak coupling limit . complexifying the space - time directions as @xmath56",
    ", we write the relevant vertex operators in a kinematic configuration consistent with the projection on the anti - self - dual components of the corresponding tensors : @xmath57 let us briefly outline the non - technical aspects of the argument .",
    "the effect of the graviton insertions is to soak up the zero modes of the worldsheet fermions in the space - time directions @xmath58 .",
    "the compexified worldsheet fermions in the @xmath59 direction @xmath60 do not contract and their one - loop contribution cancels against that of the superghost . working in the orbifold limit of @xmath61 , the twisted one - loop contribution of the @xmath25 fermions , cancels against the ( left - moving ) twisted bosonic @xmath25 contribution and the full correlator has the form of a bps amplitude involving a non - trivial bosonic correlator , weighted by the partition function of the theory which produces the elliptic genus .",
    "since only the complexified @xmath59 coordinate @xmath22 appears in the correlator , but never its complex conjugate , it leads to no contractions but , rather , contributes only through left - moving zero modes @xmath62 . in the hamiltonian representation of the lattice , this is replaced by left - moving lattice momentum insertions @xmath63\\tau_2 $ ] , with @xmath64 being the khler and complex structure moduli of @xmath59 , respectively , and @xmath65 being the complex structure of the worldsheet torus .",
    "the bosonic correlator then becomes @xmath66 where we suppress the integrals over the positions @xmath67 on the worldsheet torus .",
    "multiplying this correlator by @xmath68 , stripping off its kinematical factors and summing over @xmath6 expresses the bosonic correlator in terms of a generating function @xmath69\\bigr\\rangle \\equiv \\langle e^{-\\tilde\\epsilon_{-}j_{-}}\\rangle\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the string generator of @xmath72 rotations , defining a map from the worldsheet to target space . in the field theory limit @xmath73 ,",
    "the dependence on @xmath74 disappears and @xmath75 counts the @xmath72 charges of the bps states becoming massless as @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , at the self - dual @xmath77 point in moduli space , the gauge group arising from @xmath59 acquires an @xmath28 enhancement and the modular integral over @xmath74 is dominated by the field theory contribution .",
    "thus , the bosonic correlator only contributes through its zero mode : @xmath78 and one obtains the result in the form of a one - loop schwinger integral @xmath79 with @xmath80 being the bps mass parameter .",
    "therefore , the physical picture is that the scattering of graviphotons , upon exponentiation as in , generates a deformed background which precisely mimics the @xmath0-background in for @xmath53 .    inspired by the gopakumar - vafa reformulation of the topological string , the additional insertions should correspond to self - dual field strength vertices @xmath81 in the anti - chiral vector multiplet @xmath82 such that they couple to the spins of the @xmath83 component of @xmath45 , as required by .",
    "the known way of introducing self - dual field strength insertions to the graviphoton couplings is by means of a generalised f - term@xmath84 with @xmath85 being an @xmath1 chiral projection may be pulled in front of @xmath86 in order to modify the grassmann integration measure and recast the coupling in the form of a d - term .",
    "] of an arbitrary function @xmath87 of both chiral and anti - chiral vector multiplets .",
    "we now exploit the relation between the deformed ( exponentiated ) background and the trace representation of the gauge theory partition function in the @xmath0 background in order to motivate the specific choice of species @xmath82 of the self - dual vector insertions . indeed , for the bosonic fields",
    ", we would like to obtain a coupling of @xmath88 to @xmath75 and @xmath89 to the analogous @xmath83 generator . _ a priori _ , there are two possible choices : @xmath90 depending on whether the @xmath83 current arises from the left- or the right- moving part of the self - dual vertex operator insertions . in the corresponding correlators ,",
    "@xmath91 is accompanied by @xmath92 , whereas @xmath93 is accompanied by @xmath94 .",
    "notice that we do not allow @xmath95 or @xmath96 insertions , since that would spoil the requirement of exact solvability of our amplitude .",
    "indeed , the factorisation of the full correlator into its bosonic and fermionic parts and the exact evaluation of the exponentiated background as a gaussian path integral , yielding a correlator with good modular properties , is only possible in the absence of contractions in the @xmath59 coordinates .",
    "consider first the @xmath91 current .",
    "since it is accompanied by a left - moving @xmath97 , the corresponding vertex operator is of the form @xmath98 .",
    "hence , the left - moving part of the vertex is very similar to the graviphoton one and the resulting amplitude is bps at the one - loop level in the heterotic theory .",
    "one can show that the self - dual projection of this vertex operator sits in the anti - chiral dilaton multiplet @xmath99 .",
    "this amplitude was first computed in @xcite and its type ii interpretation was further studied in @xcite . however , as was the case with the graviphoton vertices , there is no non - trivial contribution from the worldsheet fermions . as a result , it is impossible to correctly mimic the @xmath34-symmetry twist and the resulting coupling function , in the field theory limit , fails to reproduce the correct ( perturbative ) gauge theory partition function .    on the other hand , the situation is drastically different if one considers instead the @xmath93 current .",
    "since this is left - moving , it is accompanied by the right moving @xmath100 current and the structure of the self - dual vertex operator insertions takes the form @xmath101 it can be checked that the corresponding bosonic correlator indeed exponentiates to @xmath102\\rangle$ ] , as required .",
    "however , notice that the self - dual vertex operators may also contribute through their fermionic bilinears parts , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this opens up the possibility of generating the correct @xmath34-symmetry twist , but only in an effective way at the string level since the internal @xmath55 space is compact .",
    "indeed , the operator rotating the supercharges is written in terms of the complex @xmath25 fermions @xmath105 and , in a compact space , rotations in the @xmath34-symmetry space may only be defined for quantised angles ( the corresponding bosonic operator is not a well - defined conformal field ) . in the present case , it turns out that there is a way to obtain an effective @xmath34-symmetry twist after summing over the spin structures . in order to show this ,",
    "suppose that @xmath106 self - dual vertices at positions @xmath107 contribute their fermion bilinear piece : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a short - hand notation for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , and @xmath112 are the positions of the graviton vertices .",
    "the r.h.s . displays the one - loop jacobi @xmath113-functions at spin structure  @xmath114 .",
    "the first two correspond to the space - time directions , while the last two correspond to the @xmath25 fermionic directions , twisted by the orbifold action @xmath115 .",
    "summing over the spin structures with the conventional riemann summation identity , the r.h.s . becomes a product of correlators in the odd spin structure : @xmath116 the fermions in the space - time directions soak up zero modes and yield an @xmath117-independent contribution .",
    "however , the @xmath25 fermion correlator is non - trivial and exponentiates to @xmath118 , with @xmath119 .",
    "this is precisely the operator rotating the supercharges and is identified with the @xmath34-symmetry current in the field theory limit .",
    "hence , the choice of self - dual vertices correctly mimics the @xmath0-background in the trace representation and is guaranteed to produce the perturbative part of the nekrasov partition function in the field theory limit .",
    "this limit is obtained by expanding the amplitude around a wilson line enhancement point , where both @xmath120 , as a consequence of the fact that @xmath121 are dressed with @xmath62 and @xmath122 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the vertices correspond to the self - dual field - strengths in the vector multiplet of the khler modulus @xmath123 of the heterotic @xmath59 .",

    "e.g. _ @xcite . for a treatment without auxiliary fields",

    "these couplings provide the desired one - parameter extension of the well - known @xmath1 topological couplings @xmath163 , correctly realising the full @xmath0-background .",
    "one may eventually ask what the criterion determining this particular choice of self - dual vertices is .",
    "a partial answer is based on the arguments presented in section [ motivation ] .",
    "indeed , in order to obtain the correct perturbative nekrasov partition function in the field theory limit , the scattering background must properly exponentiate to correctly mimic the @xmath0-background .",
    "recall that a very drastic constraint to our considerations was the requirement of exact solvability of our amplitude .",
    "this essentially boils down to imposing a holomorphic dependence on the @xmath59 coordinate in choosing the self - dual vertex operators .",
    "nevertheless , the present amplitude is only a single element in a family of amplitudes that lie in the same t - duality orbit .",
    "in fact , t - duality transformations that preserve the left - moving structure of the vertex operators also change the enhancement point .",
    "they typically lead to combinations of gauge fields involving also the @xmath141 gauge bundle , but all share the same field theory limit .",
    "we close this discussion with a conjecture .",
    "namely , that it is unlikely for an exactly solvable ( modular ) , truly bps amplitude to give rise to the correct nekrasov partition function , unless it is defined through the present non - bps amplitudes by taking an appropriate limit in moduli space , projecting to the bps sector .",
    "the reason is that it seems impossible to implement the fermionic @xmath34-symmetry twist in a modular invariant fashion , without spoiling the bps nature of the amplitude .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached from the very nature of the higher derivative couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ that the generalised f - terms are not super - protected against non - bps corrections . in this sense , we conjecture that the ansatz is unique , modulo the above mentioned images under t - duality .",
    "as pointed out above , from the string perspective , the couplings we considered also receive contributions from non - bps states and are not truly topological . on the other hand , in some appropriate decompactification limit , we expect the geometric details of the theory to be washed away and the resulting couplings , when properly mapped into the type ii side using the duality dictionary , to be expressed in terms of topological invariants . this expectation is consistent with the fact that preliminary results indicate the presence of differential equations satisfied by our couplings which generalise the standard holomorphic anomaly equations of the @xmath16 s @xcite .",
