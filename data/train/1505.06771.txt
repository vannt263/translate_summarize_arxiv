    "when atomic and molecular liquids are cooled sufficiently rapidly ( _ i.e. _ above the critical cooling rate @xmath1 ) , they bypass crystallization and become trapped in disordered glassy configurations  @xcite . avoiding crystallization in pure metals is very challenging and has only been achieved in experiments recently  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", multi - component liquid alloys can form bulk metallic glasses ( bmgs ) that possess centimeter or greater casting thicknesses and critical cooling rates @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "bmgs have shown great promise as structural materials because they are amorphous with few defects and possess higher processability than crystalline metals  @xcite .",
    "the conventional wisdom in the bmg research community is that bmgs should contain three or more atomic species  @xcite with atomic size differences above 12% ( _ i.e. _ the ratio of the diameters of the smallest to the largest species should be @xmath19 )  @xcite .",
    "intuitively , more atomic components with different sizes introduces geometric frustration or `` confusion , '' which delays crystallization  @xcite .",
    "also , it has been suggested that a mixture of multiple atomic species leads to dense packing in the liquid state and thus enhanced stability of the glass  @xcite .",

    "a number of recent studies of hard - sphere mixtures have shown that dense atomic packing plays an important role in determining the glass - forming ability ( gfa ) of metallic alloys  @xcite .",
    "in particular , binary metal - metal ( _ i.e. _ transition metal - transition metal ) bmgs , such as cu - zr , cu - hf , and ca - al , possess atomic size ratios @xmath23 and compositions @xmath9 that occur in the region of parameter space with the smallest @xmath1 for binary hard spheres  @xcite .",
    "can hard sphere models accurately capture the dependence of the gfa on the atomic size ratios and compositions for _ multi - component _ alloys ? in this manuscript , we study the glass - forming ability of ternary hard - sphere mixtures .",
    "we find two key results : ( 1 ) when the sizes of the three components are comparable , ternary systems behave similar to binary systems , and the gfa can not be larger than that of a binary system consisting of the largest and smallest components . in this case , the packing efficiency of the ternary system is close to that of the binary systems .",
