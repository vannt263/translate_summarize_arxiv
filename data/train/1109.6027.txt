    "in collider processes with several disparate scales , fixed - order perturbative expansions in qcd become unreliable since higher - order corrections are enhanced by large double logarithms of scale ratios .",
    "the classic example of such a multi - scale process is the drell - yan production of electroweak gauge bosons with transverse momentum @xmath0 much smaller than their mass .",
    "the leading logarithmically - enhanced corrections in this kinematic region were resummed in @xcite , and an all - order formula for the resummed cross section at small @xmath0 was obtained in the seminal work @xcite .",
    "the region of small @xmath0 is of great phenomenological importance , since it has the largest cross section and is used e.g.  to extract the @xmath10-boson mass and width . in the related process of higgs - boson production via gluon fusion ,",
    "the region of small @xmath0 is important because one usually vetoes hard jets in order to enhance the signal over background ratio .",
    "the traditional resummation approach of @xcite suffers from the presence of singularities arising from integrals over the landau pole of the running coupling constant , and hence a prescription is required to regularize the integral . in practical applications , the integration is cut off at large @xmath11 values , and to account for the missing contributions a non - perturbative model function is employed . for transverse momenta in the perturbative domain",
    "these long - distance contributions are formally power suppressed , but it is irritating that an explicit prescription for how to deal with them is needed even for @xmath0 values deep in the perturbative regime .",
    "the explicit cut - off also makes it difficult to perform the matching onto fixed - order computations , since cut - off effects persist even when the formula is evaluated at large @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the mass of the drell - yan object .    in a recent paper , we have derived a novel form of the all - order factorization theorem for drell - yan production at small transverse momentum , @xmath14 @xcite , using methods from effective field theory .",
    "the cross section is expressed as a product of a @xmath15-dependent hard function with a convolution of two transverse - position ( @xmath11 ) dependent parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "the form of the factorization theorem is affected by an anomaly of the effective lagrangian , which implies that the naive factorization of two collinear sectors valid at the level of the classical lagrangian is broken by quantum effects .",
    "this gives rise to an anomalous , @xmath15-dependent factor under the convolution integral in @xmath11 space .",
    "consistency conditions ensure that this factor is a pure power of @xmath15 , with an @xmath11-dependent exponent . in the short - distance region , for @xmath16 , the product of transverse - position dependent pdfs can be expanded in terms of standard pdfs convoluted with perturbatively calculable kernel functions .",
    "the resulting effective field - theory formula for the resummed cross section is free of landau - pole singularities and therefore _ per se _ does not require non - perturbative modeling .    naively , assuming that transverse momentum @xmath0 and transverse displacement @xmath11 are conjugate variables satisfying @xmath17 , the factorization formula derived in @xcite and @xcite only applies as long as @xmath18 is in the perturbative domain .",
    "however , as early as in 1979 , parisi and petronzio have argued that for asymptotically large momentum transfer , the drell - yan cross section at very small and even vanishing transverse momentum of the lepton pair can be calculated in resummed perturbation theory @xcite . using methods from effective field theory",
    ", we develop a novel framework for the systematic short - distance calculation of the drell - yan cross section at small and very small @xmath0 .",
    "we show that if the mass @xmath13 of the drell - yan object is so large that the scale @xmath19 $ ] is in the perturbative domain ( here @xmath20 denotes the color representation of the partons creating the object ) , the cross section can be calculated using renormalization - group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory for arbitrarily small values of @xmath0 , up to power corrections controlled by @xmath21 .",
    "the scale @xmath22 emerges dynamically , and it screens the cross section from receiving long - distance contributions at leading power .",
    "we distinguish three regions of transverse momentum , which require different classes of terms to be resummed . in the region of large @xmath0 , approximately @xmath23gev for the case of electroweak gauge - boson production ,",
    "a fixed - order perturbative calculation is justified . in an intermediate region , the perturbative series exhibits large logarithms as well as a strong factorial growth of a certain set of higher - order corrections , and both must be resummed in order to obtain reliable results .",
    "finally , in the region of very small @xmath24 , the power counting of the perturbative expansion must be modified and certain higher - order terms must be resummed at all orders , even though they are naively suppressed by powers of @xmath3 .",
    "we set up our formalism in such a way that a single formula automatically interpolates between the three regions .",
    "we provide all ingredients to perform the resummation of large logarithms at next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic ( nnll ) order . in the low-@xmath0 region",
    "this requires retaining terms of up to four - loop order in some coefficient functions .",
    "these terms can be related to known anomalous dimensions using rg equations .    as a by - product of our analysis",
    ", we derive for the first time an explicit formula for the intercept of the differential cross section @xmath25 at vanishing transverse momentum , in which the normalization and first - order perturbative correction in @xmath5 are included .",
    "we show that in the region of very small @xmath0 a usual operator - product expansion ( ope ) of the cross section is inapplicable due to a very strong asymptotic divergence of the twist expansion .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 and the sensitivity to long - distance hadronic effects can only be assessed by resumming the ope . for the case of the @xmath0 dependence",
    "such a resummation is implicit in our approach .",
    "long - distance corrections , which could affect the matching of transverse - position dependent pdfs onto standard pdfs , can at present only be modeled using a phenomenological function @xmath26 .",
    "our formalism provides a convenient framework for implementing such a form factor . using different forms of model functions",
    ", we find that to a good accuracy the shape of the cross section is only affected by the coefficient of the first term in the expansion of the form factor in transverse separation , @xmath27 .",
    "the main effect of long - distance corrections is to shift the peak of the @xmath28 distribution for @xmath6 bosons produced at the tevatron and lhc by roughly about @xmath29 .",
    "we do not confirm the rather pessimistic statements about the validity of the short - distance analysis of the transverse - momentum distribution in the region of very small @xmath0 made in @xcite , where it was concluded that a drell - yan mass as large as @xmath30gev would be required to keep power corrections to the intercept at an acceptable level ( below 20% ) .",
    "instead , we find that the theory developed in this paper works well for @xmath10 and @xmath6 production at hadron colliders , and it will work even better for the production of higgs bosons via gluon fusion or the production of new heavy particles such as @xmath31 or @xmath32 bosons or slepton pairs .    in section  [ sec",
    ": fact ] we briefly review results from our previous work @xcite and reorganize them in a way suited for our discussion . in section  [ sec : expansion ]",
    "we then explain the systematics of the resummation scheme valid at very small @xmath0 , where the emergent non - perturbative short - distance scale @xmath22 protects the cross section from receiving long - distance contributions at leading power .",
    "the modified power counting required in this region is introduced and used to derive the relevant expansions of the various coefficient functions in the factorization formula for the differential cross section .",
    "we also explain the relevance of the three regions in transverse - momentum space mentioned above .",
    "section  [ sec : intercept ] is devoted to a study of the @xmath0 distribution near the origin .",
    "we derive an explicit formula for the cross section @xmath25 at @xmath4 including the normalization and first - order correction in @xmath5 .",
    "we also explain why the ope breaks down for very small @xmath0 .",
    "detailed systematics studies of of our results are performed in section  [ sec : numerics ] , while section  [ sec : data ] is devoted to comparisons with tevatron and lhc data on @xmath6-boson production .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "technical details of our calculations are described in four appendices .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we have analyzed the drell - yan process using methods of effective field theory . in the kinematical region where @xmath33 , the double differential cross section for @xmath6-boson production was shown to obey the factorization formula @xmath34 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 denote the @xmath6-boson couplings to quarks @xmath36 in units of @xmath37 , @xmath38",

    "a corresponding formula for the differential cross section @xmath25 , along with explicit expressions for the weak charges , is presented in appendix  [ app : a ] .",
    "the function @xmath42 is a short - distance ( `` hard '' ) wilson coefficient arising in the matching of the weak currents of the @xmath6 boson onto the leading - power current operator in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "the perturbative ( `` collinear '' ) kernel functions @xmath43 are given by ( we denote @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 the functions @xmath48 arise in the matching of transverse - position dependent pdfs @xmath49 defined in @xcite onto ordinary pdfs , @xmath50 which is valid at small transverse separation @xmath51 .",
    "the factorized cross section ( [ fact1 ] ) receives power corrections in the two small ratios @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where the latter ones enter via ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "these power corrections will not be indicated explicitly in most of our equations .    in the factorization formulas ( [ fact1 ] ) and ( [ cdef ] ) , the dependence on the two disparate scales @xmath54 and @xmath0 is factorized explicitly in @xmath11 space .",
    "note the unusual fact that dependence on the high scale @xmath54 enters in two places : via the hard matching coefficient @xmath42 , but also via an @xmath11-dependent power of @xmath54 under the fourier integral in ( [ cdef ] ) .",
    "the latter effect is due to the collinear factorization anomaly discovered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which results from the fact that the naive factorization property of the classical effective lagrangian of scet ( i.e. , the property that different sectors of the effective theory do not interact with one another ) is in some cases spoiled by quantum effects .",
    "this anomaly introduces a power - law dependence on @xmath54 in the kernel functions in @xmath11 space .",
    "the anomalous exponent @xmath55 is constrained by the non - abelian exponentiation theorem @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath51 , it can be calculated in perturbation theory , and it is presently known to two - loop order @xcite .",
    "a simpler example for the occurrence of the collinear anomaly is the sudakov form factor of a massive vector boson , for which the anomalous power - law dependence on the gauge - boson mass was derived in @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was shown that also the jet - broadening distribution in @xmath56 annihilations is affected by a factorization anomaly @xcite .",
    "the factorization formulas ( [ fact1 ] ) and ( [ cdef ] ) have been shown in @xcite to be equivalent , to all orders in perturbation theory , to an expression for the resummed cross section derived in a seminal work by collins , soper , and sterman ( css ) @xcite .",
    "an interesting effect of the anomalous terms is that they give rise to additional contributions to the resummation exponents @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the css approach , which therefore do not agree with the corresponding quantities for soft - gluon resummation . in particular , starting at three - loop order the coefficient @xmath57 is longer equal to the cusp anomalous dimension @xmath59 .",
    "we note at this point that recently an alternative scet - based resummation scheme for drell - yan production at small @xmath0 was presented @xcite , in which only the large logarithms contained in the hard function @xmath60 in ( [ fact1 ] ) are resummed .",
    "this approach does not address the resummation of the large logarithms steming from the collinear anomaly , which reside in the kernel functions @xmath43 in ( [ cdef ] ) .",
    "the method of @xcite therefore does not provide a consistent resummation scheme already at nll order . while these authors correctly reproduce the next - to - leading logarithms in the cross section itself , this is not sufficient . for observables subject to sudakov double logarithms , it is essential that the counting of logarithms is performed in the exponent and not at the level of the cross section",
    ". if the nll terms are not exponentiated , higher - order terms in perturbation theory become arbitrarily large in the region where the logarithms are of @xmath61 . in appendix  [ nloexpansion ] we discuss the systematics of the expansion in more detail and give explicit expressions for the fixed - order expansion to @xmath62 of our result for the cross section .",

    ", the scale @xmath94 should correspond to a physical scale in the underlying factorization theorem . in our case , where we have chosen to evolve the hard function down to a typical collinear scale , the requirement is that @xmath94 should be set such that the perturbative series for the kernels @xmath43 has a well - behaved perturbative expansion .",
    "obviously , this requires that _ on average _ the @xmath11-dependent logarithm @xmath64 is small , so that the perturbative expansions of the functions @xmath84 and @xmath80 are well behaved .",
    "the factorization formula ( [ fact1 ] ) has been derived under the assumption @xmath33 .",
    "it neglects power corrections of order @xmath52 , and also higher - order terms @xmath102 in ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "the first type of power corrections can be included by matching our formulas to the known fixed - order results for the differential cross section ( see below ) .",

    "after integration over @xmath103 , the factorized dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath0 in ( [ cdef ] ) gets intertwined in a complicated way , and this gives rise to the peculiar effect that the two scales @xmath0 and @xmath11 decouple for very small @xmath0 as long as @xmath54 is sufficiently large .",
    "this explains an observation made long ago by parisi and petronzio , who found that the intercept of the differential drell - yan cross section @xmath25 at @xmath4 can be calculated using short - distance methods provided that the mass @xmath13 of the drell - yan pair is asymptotically large @xcite .",
    "note that without the collinear anomaly ( i.e. , for @xmath104 ) such an effect could not arise , since then the scales @xmath0 and @xmath11 would trivially be related by @xmath105 due to the fourier integral in ( [ cdef ] ) . the interesting interplay beteween the scales @xmath13 and @xmath0 is less obvious in the traditional formalism , which implicitly adopts the choice @xmath101 .",
    "this choice eliminates the anomaly at nll , but the @xmath13 dependence then enters via the hard function , which for @xmath101 is a non - trivial part of the fourier integral .    to analyze the fourier integral in the effective theory ,",

    "additional powers of @xmath64 under the integral in ( [ toy ] ) , which enter when the @xmath114 corrections in ( [ cfinal ] ) are included , can be generated by taking derivatives with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "it follows that the scale choice @xmath115 indeed eliminates large logarithms in the ( fourier - transformed ) coefficient functions , as might have been expected from the beginning .    the situation changes , however , at small transverse momentum .",
    "there are two possibilities that must be differentiated .",
    "consider first the case where @xmath95 defined in ( [ etadef ] ) remains smaller than 1 when @xmath115 approaches the non - perturbative domain . in this case",
    "the above discussion remains valid , but the perturbative calculation of the kernels @xmath66 is no longer under theoretical control .",
    "indeed , in this case one must resort to a formula for the cross section in terms of the transverse - position dependent pdfs @xmath116 in ( [ ope ] ) , which are then genuine , non - perturbative objects .",
    "but there is also a second possibility , that @xmath95 reaches 1 for values of @xmath94 that are still in the perturbative domain .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the value of @xmath94 where this happens , i.e.@xmath117 where in the last step we have used the one - loop approximation for the running coupling . solving the first equation numerically",
    ", one finds @xmath118gev in the present case , which is indeed a reasonable short - distance scale . for @xmath119 , the integral in ( [ toy ] ) is ultra - violet ( uv ) divergent for @xmath120 , since the integrand then approaches @xmath121 .",

    "this gaussian fall - off is the dominating factor , which prevents that @xmath11 can become arbitrarily large .",

    "we recall that the emergence of the scale @xmath22 in ( [ cdef ] ) , below which the scaling of @xmath134 decouples from @xmath0 , is a consequence of the collinear anomaly , which is responsible for the anomalous dependence on @xmath54 in ( [ cdef ] ) .",
    "provided the mass of the drell - yan boson is large enough that @xmath135 , the transverse - momentum distribution is protected from long - distance physics even for arbitrarily small @xmath0 .",
    "the resummed perturbative series for the cross section generates the scale @xmath22 dynamically , and even though this is a short - distance scale , it is related to the boson mass @xmath54 in a genuinely non - perturbative way .",

    "it follows that for very small @xmath0 the resummation procedure must be reorganized , using the modified power counting @xmath142 .",

    "as we will show in the following section , the intercept of the spectrum @xmath25 ( or @xmath182 ) can be calculated using short - distance methods , but it exhibits an essential singularity at @xmath183 and hence does not admit any perturbative expansion . since the spectrum is at least approximately given by a smoothly falling function , the area under it ( the total cross section ) is roughly proportional to the height ( intercept ) times a typical width .",
    "the requirement that the area be perturbatively calculable requires that not only the height , but also the characteristic width of the spectrum are governed by non - perturbative short - distance physics .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the region of larger @xmath184 is not affected by long - distance corrections and should be described well by fixed - order perturbation theory . in this region the data lies somewhat above the prediction , in particular for the case of the atlas results . a comparison to the existing fixed - order results",
    "is given in figure  [ fixed ] .",
    "the red bands correspond to the @xmath62 fixed - order result for the spectrum , which the highest order currently known .",
    "to compute this result we use the numerical code qt @xcite . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have evaluated all results using the mrst2008nnlo pdf set .",
    "the fixed - order results diverge to @xmath185 for vanishing transverse momentum .",
    "since the fixed - order result depends both on @xmath0 and @xmath54 it is not clear which value one should choose for the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "the edges of the fixed - order band in figure  [ fixed ] correspond to the two choices @xmath165 and @xmath186 .",
    "the choice @xmath165 diverges to @xmath187 , while @xmath186 rises to @xmath188 .",
    "our result is consistent with the @xmath62 fixed - order result at large @xmath0 , but performing the matching to this order would presumably lead to a slight increase of our cross - section prediction in this region .",
    "we have also compared our findings to the results @xcite .",
    "they perform resummation at the same level of accuracy but with a different formalism , based on the css formula @xcite .",
    "the peak position is exactly the same as in our result , and their peak height is about 2.5% lower , but compatible within uncertainties . since we have adopted a time - like hard matching scale , which gives a 4% higher cross - section than the usual space - like choice , this difference is not unexpected . also at @xmath189 ,",
    "the two results are compatible , but their central value is about 8% higher than ours , perhaps because the nlo matching has been implemented , or because of the unitarization prescription implemented in their formula . by inspecting plots showing a comparison of results of the resbos code @xcite with tevatron @xcite and lhc @xcite data ,",
    "we conclude that our results are compatible with these predictions , which also have n@xmath190ll accuracy .",
    "we also note that our results have much smaller scale uncertainties than the numerical results obtained in @xcite based on the formalism presented in @xcite .",
    "figure  3 in @xcite shows that the peak height in @xmath28 changes roughly by a factor 3 when the factorization scale @xmath94 is varied in the narrow range @xmath191 .",
    "in our case , the peak height changes only by 5% , even though the scale is varied over the larger range @xmath192 .",
    "we believe that this numerical instability illustrates our earlier point , namely that the results of @xcite only have ll accuracy ( in the exponent ) , since they do not resum the corrections associated with the collinear anomaly .",
    "the transverse momentum spectrum in drell - yan processes is one of the most basic observables at hadron colliders .",
    "it neverthess manifests a number of remarkable properties at low transverse momentum .",
    "these are associated with the collinear anomaly , which complicates the factorization of the cross section . because of the anomaly , not only the hard function , which encodes the virtual effects associated with the electroweak boson production , but also the product of collinear functions has a dependence on the boson mass @xmath13 . in a previous paper , we have shown that the anomalous @xmath13 dependence exponentiates in transverse position space .",
    "this guarantees that the associated large logarithms are under control , but at the same time renders the fourier integral non - trivial , which yields the transverse momentum spectrum .",
    "one of the interesting consequences of the presence of the anomaly is that the scale @xmath94 , which controls the perturbative corrections to the factorization theorem is no longer @xmath193 at very low @xmath0 , but saturates to a non - perturbative value @xmath194 for @xmath131 .",
    "numerically , @xmath195 for @xmath6-production , which implies that the spectrum remains short - distance dominated even in the limit @xmath131 .",
    "the fact , that the zero intercept of @xmath25 is calculable for very large drell - yan masses was pointed out a long time ago by by parisi and petronzio , but our formalism has allowed us to systematically evaluate the corrections to their asymptotic result .",
    "the uncertainty on the calculable short - distance corrections , as well as the long - distance effects , which we estimate using models , are seizable given that the relevant scale is @xmath195 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to obtain a prediction for the intercept for @xmath6-production with an accuracy of about 25% .",
    "this demonstrates that , contrary to common belief , the mechanism identified by parisi and petronzio is not merely an interesting theoretical result , but of phenomenological relevance .",
    "in addition to making the spectrum infrared safe , the anomaly precludes the expansion of the spectrum in any of its parameters .",
    "in particular , there is a strong factorial divergence in the expansion in @xmath3 , associated with terms in the fourier integral which become enhanced near @xmath4 .",
    "while they are not logarithmically enhanced , these terms nevertheless need to be resummed .",
    "an even more violent divergence arises when one tries to expand the spectrum around @xmath196 . in this case",
    "the @xmath155-th order terms in the expansion are enhanced by @xmath197 , which renders the expanded result meaningless . to study long - distance effects",
    ", we insert a cut - off function such as a gaussian @xmath198 into the fourier integral .",
    "we find that the long - distance effects are of the expected size and largely independent of the form of the cut - off .",
    "however , a twist expansion @xmath199 suffers from the same strong divergence as the expanision around @xmath4 and can thus not be used .",
    "we have compared to experimental results from both runs of the tevatron and from the lhc .",
    "we find excellent agreement with our predictions , however , for @xmath200 the agreement is only achieved after including long - distance effects .",
    "the same choice of the associated parameter @xmath201 describes these effects both at the tevatron and the lhc , which provides a consistency check on the model we used .",
    "it would be interesting to study the long - distance effects in more detail .",
    "to this end , the recently proposed variables @xmath202 and @xmath203 would be especially well suited , and the variable @xmath203 has now been measured by dzero . to compute these quantities",
    ", one needs to include the decay of the electroweak boson into the lepton pair .",
    "it is straightforward to extend our results to this case , and it is important in order to be able to implement the lepton cuts used by the experiments , and to compute the charged - lepton spectrum used for the @xmath10-mass determination .    the formalism developed here can be applied to other drell - yan - type processes , such as higgs - boson production or the production of new heavy , color - neutral particles at hadron colliders .",
    "the case of higgs production via gluon - gluon fusion is particularly interesting . in this case",
    "many of our formulas apply with a simple substitution of color factors . in particular , in the expressions for",
    "the dynamically generated scale @xmath22 in ( [ qstar ] ) and for the exponent @xmath84 of the bessel integral in ( [ gfmod ] ) , one must replace the one - loop cusp anomalous dimension in the fudamental representation with that in the adjoint representation , @xmath204 . as a result , for a higgs with mass of 120gev , for example",
    ", the value of @xmath22 is 7.5gev .",
    "this is truly a short - distance scale , and all of the methods developed here should work much more accurately than in the case of @xmath6-boson production .",
