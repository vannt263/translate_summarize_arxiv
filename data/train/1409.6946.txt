    "the motivation for this paper comes from a work by gawdzki and horvai , @xcite , in which the authors study a model for the motion of particles carried in a turbulent fluid .",
    "the trajectories of two distinct particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are each described by a brownian motion in @xmath2 with a covariance of the form @xmath3 the @xmath4 matrix valued function @xmath5 is invariant under the natural action of the orthogonal group and consequently the inter - particle distance @xmath6 is a diffusion process on @xmath7 . for different choices of the covariance function @xmath5 , different qualitative behaviours are observed , and these correspond to different boundary conditions at @xmath8 for the diffusion describing the inter - particle distance .",
    "see also le jan and raimond @xcite for a description of these phases .",
    "gawdzki and horvai study the case where @xmath8 is both a entrance and exit boundary point , and the function @xmath5 is not smooth at the origin .",
    "they then introduce a viscosity effect acting at small scales by replacing @xmath5 by a smooth covariance function obtained by smoothing @xmath5 in a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "particles moving in this regularized flow never meet , and @xmath8 is now a natural boundary point for the diffusion describing the inter - particle distance .",
    "they then further vary the model and consider particles whose motion is affected by molecular diffusivity , modelled by adding , for each particle , a small independent brownian perturbation to the motion of the flow .",
    "if the additional diffusivity and the scale at which viscosity acts both are taken to zero in an appropriate balance then gawdzki and horvai show that the inter - particle distance @xmath9 converges to a diffusion on @xmath7 with the boundary point being sticky : that is a regular boundary point at which the diffusion spends a strictly positive amount of time .",
    "sticky boundary behaviour was first identified by feller , as described in the article @xcite .",
    "subsequently the process which is a brownian motion on @xmath7 with a sticky boundary at @xmath8 was studied as an example of a stochastic differential equation with no strong solution , see chitashvili , @xcite and warren @xcite , and recent work by engelbert and peskir @xcite and bass @xcite .",
    "stochastic flows in which the inter - particle distance evolves as a sticky brownian motion have been studied by le jan and lemaire @xcite , by howitt and warren @xcite and @xcite , and by schertzer , sun and swart , @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a simplification of the gawdzki - horvai model .",
    "our goal is to address , in this simplified setting , the question raised by gawdzki and horvai of characterizing the behaviour of @xmath10 particles .",
    "we take the dimension of the underlying space to be @xmath11 , and the motion of distinct particles , in the absence of viscosity or molecular diffusivity , to be given by brownian motions which are independent of one another until the particles meet .",
    "let @xmath5 be a real - valued , smooth , positive definite function on @xmath12 , satisfying @xmath13 , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and @xmath16 as @xmath17 . define the constant @xmath18 , which we assume is strictly positive , via @xmath19    for each @xmath20 there exists a smooth flow of brownian motions associated with the scaled covariance function @xmath21 , the @xmath10 point motion of which has generator @xmath22 as @xmath20 tends to infinity the covariance functions @xmath23 converge to the singular covariance @xmath24 , and correspondingly , the @xmath10-point motions associated with the flows converge to systems of coalescing brownian motions .",
    "fix a constant @xmath25 and for @xmath26 , we define generators @xmath27 which are perturbations of the generators by addition of the laplacian with co - efficient @xmath28 .",
    "this works against coalescence by giving each particle in the flow a small amount of independent diffusivity . as a consequence paths of particles in the flow can cross and the @xmath10-point motions are no longer associated with flow of maps .",
    "the two effects : approximating a coalescing flow by smooth flows , and adding diffusivity , are in balance as we pass to the limit , as can be seen by the following analysis of the @xmath29-point motion .",
    "let @xmath30 be the two point motion with generator @xmath31 .",
    "it is enough to consider the difference @xmath32 which is a diffusion on the real line in natural scale and with speed measure @xmath33 as @xmath20 tends to infinity @xmath34 weakly converges to the measure @xmath35 where the constant @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 thus the limiting diffusion describing @xmath38 is a sticky brownian with the parameter @xmath36 describing the degree of stickiness at @xmath8 , and the limit of the two point motion is determined by this , together with @xmath39 and @xmath40 each being brownian motions .",
    "this leaves open the limiting behaviour of the perturbed @xmath10-point motions for @xmath41 .",
    "consistent families of diffusions in @xmath42 whose components are brownian motions evolving as independent brownian motions whenever they are unequal were studied in @xcite . for such processes",
    "there are times at which many co - ordinates co - incide and it is necessary to describe the sticky behaviour at such times .",
    "this is specified by families of of non - negative co - efficients @xmath43 .",
    "thinking of the @xmath10-point motion as a system of @xmath10 particles @xmath44 gives the rate , in an excursion theoretic sense , at which a clump of @xmath45 particles separates into two clumps one consisting of @xmath46 particles and the other of @xmath47 particles .",
    "the result of this paper is the following identification of these co - efficients for our model .",
    "[ main ] the @xmath10 point motions with generators @xmath48 converge in law as @xmath20 tends to infinity to a family of sticky brownian motions associated to the family of parameters @xmath43 given by @xmath49    the form of the parameters @xmath44 given in this result is highly suggestive of the underlying mechanisms at work .",
    "the variables @xmath50 chosen according to a gaussian measure can be thought of as the positions of a cluster of @xmath45 particles experiencing independent diffusivity , and the variable @xmath51 represents a `` singularity '' in the underlying flow that causes the cluster to separate into two .",
    "of course this is far from being rigorous .    to give theorem [ main ] a precise meaning we must specify the law of the family of sticky brownian motions associated to the family of parameters @xmath43 .",
    "we do this by means of a well - posed martingale problem , following @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath52 is a family of nonnegative parameters satisfying the consistency property @xmath53 for our purposes in this paper we may also assume the symmetry @xmath54 .",
    "we now recall the main result from @xcite concerning the characterization of consistent families of sticky brownian motions .",
    "we begin by partitioning @xmath42 into cells . a cell @xmath55 is determined by some weak total ordering @xmath56 of the @xmath57 via @xmath58 thus @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are three of the thirteen distinct cells into which @xmath62 is partitioned .",
    "suppose that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are disjoint subsets of @xmath65 with both @xmath63 and @xmath64 non - empty .",
    "with such a pair we associate a vector @xmath66 belonging to @xmath42 with components given by @xmath67 we associate with each point @xmath68 certain vectors of this form . to this end note",
    "that each point @xmath69 determines a partition @xmath70 of @xmath57 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 belong to the same component of @xmath70 if and only if @xmath73 . then to each point",
    "@xmath74 we associate the set of vectors , denoted by @xmath75 , which consists of every vector of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 forms one component of the partition @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the space of real - valued functions defined on @xmath42 which are continuous , and whose restriction to each cell is given by a linear function .",
    "given a set of parameters @xmath79 we define the operator @xmath80 from @xmath81 to the space of real valued functions on @xmath42 which are constant on each cell by @xmath82 here on the righthandside @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of elements in @xmath63 and @xmath85 is the number of elements in @xmath64 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 determined by @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath86 denotes the ( one - sided ) gradient of @xmath87 in the direction @xmath88 at the point @xmath89 , that is @xmath90    we say an @xmath42-valued stochastic process @xmath91 solves the @xmath80-martingale problem if for each @xmath92 , @xmath93 relative to some common filtration , and the bracket between co - ordinates @xmath94 and @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 in particular @xmath97 .",

    "it is a process with this law that we refer to as a family of @xmath10 sticky brownian motions associated with the parameters @xmath99 .",

    "in fact if @xmath113 denotes the first time that @xmath111 leaves this set , we have @xmath114= \\frac{1 } { 2\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1 } { n \\choose k }   \\theta(k : n - k ) } , \\ ] ] and , for each cell @xmath115 that corresponds to a ( ordered ) partition of @xmath116 into two parts having sizes @xmath46 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 notice how this is consistent with the idea that @xmath119 describes the rate at which a cluster of @xmath10 particles splits .    in view of these observations on the behaviour of sticky diffusions",
    "we can reasonably expect to be able to identify the parameters @xmath120 arising in the limiting behaviour of our @xmath10 point motions with generators by investigating how these processes , for @xmath20 large , leave neighbourhoods of the origin .",
    "interestingly very close to the origin , at distances of the order @xmath121 , the @xmath10 point motions are spherically symmetric , but at larger distances a coalescence effect leads to exit distributions concentrated on points corresponding to the cluster of particles splitting into two subclusters .",
    "we will suppose that @xmath104 when governed by probability measures @xmath122 evolves as a diffusion with generator @xmath48 starting from @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the generators @xmath48 are invariant under shifts @xmath123 , and consequently the projection @xmath101 of @xmath102 is a diffusion also . in view of",
    "and it is natural to study the exit time and distribution of @xmath111 from @xmath108 under @xmath124 in order to determine the parameters @xmath44 associated with the limiting @xmath10 point motion .",
    "we will estimate the exit distribution ( non - rigorously ) by approximating the behaviour of @xmath111 on two different scales .",
    "let @xmath125 denote the ball of radius @xmath126 in @xmath109 , @xmath127 now , for a fixed small @xmath107 , the map @xmath128 is approximately quadratic for @xmath129 and we use this to approximate the covariance matrix of @xmath111 in the ball @xmath130 . observe that if the matrix @xmath131 has entries @xmath132 then for vectors @xmath133 we have @xmath134 .",

    "we next consider @xmath111 started from a point @xmath89 on the sphere of radius @xmath150 which we will assume has distinct co - ordinates .",
    "let @xmath151 be the permutation so that @xmath152 , and denote by @xmath153 the vector @xmath154 .",
    "our second approximation applies to @xmath111 until it first leaves the domain @xmath155 .",
    "if two particles come close to each other , then they have a negligible probability of separating by a significant distance prior to the exit time @xmath156 from the domain .",
    "thus we can treat @xmath111 similarly to ( the projection to @xmath109 ) of a system of @xmath10 coalescing brownian motions .",
    "in particular this means that if @xmath111 exits via the outer part of the boundary then it does so with @xmath157 . consequently applying the optional stopping theorem to the martingale @xmath158 gives",
    "rise to the estimate @xmath159 moreover if @xmath111 does exit via the outer boundary then as it does so there are only two clusters of particles ( see lemma [ coalesce ] for the corresponding statement about coalescing brownian motion ) , and applying the optional stopping theorem to @xmath160 gives @xmath161    we now make use of a renewal argument .",
    "the diffusion with generator is ergodic , and consequently we conclude that the process @xmath111 spends all but a negligible amount of time at a distance of order @xmath121 from the origin prior to exiting @xmath108 . from this inner region",
    "it makes excursions to the sphere of radius @xmath150 and , each time it does , it has a small probability of exiting @xmath108 rather than returning to the inner region .",
    "when it does return to distances of order @xmath121 we can assume by mixing that it is starts afresh and forgets its history .",
    "thus @xmath111 makes approximately a geometrically distributed number of excursions to the sphere of radius @xmath150 before exiting @xmath108 , and we conclude , neglecting the time spent outside the ball @xmath130 , that the expected time to exit @xmath108 is estimated by @xmath162 } {   { \\mathbf e}_0^{n , n } \\bigl [ { \\mathbf p}^{n , n}_{x ( t_{b(\\epsilon / n ) } ) } \\bigl ( \\hat{x } \\text { exits $ d(\\epsilon ) \\setminus      d ( 1/(\\epsilon n^2))$ via the outer boundary }   \\bigr)\\bigr]},\\ ] ] where @xmath163 denotes the first time of exiting the ball @xmath130 .",
    "similarly we estimate that the probability of exiting @xmath108 at time @xmath164 with @xmath165 for all @xmath166 and @xmath167 is approximately @xmath168 } { { \\mathbf e}_0^{n ,",

    "thus , in view of and , and taking the cell @xmath170 , we guess that the parameter @xmath171 associated with a limiting @xmath10-point motion should be equal to the limit as @xmath20 tends to infinity and @xmath112 tends to zero of @xmath172 } { 2 { \\mathbf e}_0^{n , n } [ t_{b(\\epsilon / n ) } ] } \\ ] ] substituting in our estimates from and and using the fact that the exit distribution from @xmath130 is uniform we arrive at @xmath173 in which the integral over the unit sphere @xmath174 is taken with respect to lebesgue measure on the sphere normalized so @xmath175 .",
    "when we rewrite the spherical integral as a gaussian integral this agrees the value given in theorem [ main ] .",
    "in view of the characterization of a family of sticky brownian motions by the @xmath80-martingale problem , it is a natural strategy to prove theorem [ main ] by considering smooth approximations @xmath176 to a given function @xmath177 and to derive , using weak convergence , from the martingale property , under @xmath135 , of @xmath178 that @xmath179 is a martingale under @xmath180 .",
    "there are difficulties to be overcome in pursuing this which arise because @xmath181 is not continuous .",

    "then both @xmath331 and @xmath51 lie in the closure of the cell that contains @xmath89 , and by the linearity of @xmath87 restricted to the closure of that cell , @xmath332 consequently we define @xmath333 and @xmath334 , extending each linearly within cells so as to functions @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "[ coalesce ] suppose that @xmath335 are a system of coalescing brownian motions on @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath336 , and let @xmath126 denote @xmath337 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath338 such that for all @xmath126 and @xmath339 with @xmath340 , @xmath341    for @xmath342 , let @xmath343 be the event @xmath344 since the event in question is the union of these events , it is enough to prove the desired estimate holds for each @xmath343 .",
    "projecting the three dimensional process @xmath345 onto the plane @xmath346 we see @xmath343 can be identified with the event that a two dimensional brownian motion started at a point satisfying @xmath347 exits the domain @xmath348 via the boundary @xmath349 . by comparing with a wedge with a circular outer boundary and interior angle @xmath350 and solving the appropriate dirichlet problem this exit probability",
    "is easily seen to by bounded by @xmath351 .",
    "returning to the motivation coming from gawdzki and horvai it is natural to interpret the results from this paper in terms of the stochastic flows .",
    "as remarked in the introduction the consistent family of @xmath10 point motions with generators @xmath48 do not correspond to any stochastic flow of maps . however according to the theory developed by le jan and",
    "raimomd @xcite they are associated with the more general notion of a flow of kernels .",
    "let @xmath352 denote the centred gaussian process with covariance function @xmath353 .",
    "suppose @xmath354 are real valued brownian motions , independent of each other and @xmath355 .",
    "then a diffusion with generator @xmath48 can be obtained , at least in a formal sense , by solving the stochastic differential equations @xmath356 the stochastic flow of kernels @xmath357 associated with family @xmath48 describes a cloud of infinitesimal particles moving in this manner .",
    "it can be obtained by filtering on @xmath355 , @xmath358 these kernels have smooth densities which satisfy a stochastic partial differential equation of advection - diffusion type . if @xmath359 denotes the density of @xmath360 at @xmath331 , then @xmath361 where @xmath362 .",
    "simulations showing a realization of the density of @xmath363 for two different sets of parameter values are shown in figure [ fig ] .",
    "as @xmath20 tends to infinity these flows of kernels converge to the flow of kernels associated to a consistent family of sticky brownian motions .",
    "flows of this type were first considered by le jan and raimond @xcite . for a general splitting rule ,",
    "they were defined by howitt and warren @xcite , and have subsequently been studied extensively in @xcite . in general the parameters of a consistent family of sticky brownian motions can represented in terms of a splitting measure @xmath367 as @xmath368 for the parameters @xmath44 given by theorem 1 , the measure @xmath367 is given by @xmath369 where @xmath370 denotes the standard gaussian density , and @xmath232 the corresponding distribution function .",
    "the right and left speeds of the flow are defined by @xmath371 and with @xmath367 given by are both infinite .",
    "thus according to the theorem 2.7 of @xcite , the support of the corresponding kernels is almost surely equal to @xmath12 .",
    "however , by theorem 2.8 of @xcite , for any @xmath372 and @xmath89 the measure @xmath373 is purely atomic .",
    "this seems consistent with the simulations which show the mass becomeing more concentrated as the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath374 increase and decrease respectively .",
    "it is less evident from these simulations that , in the limit , the set of points carrying the mass is dense",
