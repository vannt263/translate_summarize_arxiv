    "charge inhomogeneities are an ubiquitous feature in strongly correlated electron systems",
    ". one of these inhomogeneities is the stripe phase present in some underdoped cuprates.@xcite in this phase , it has been recently suggested by theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies that both stripes and intervening spin regions may be modeled as two - leg ladders .",

    "this material becomes also superconductor under pressure@xcite and it also presents a competing charge ordered phase.@xcite    then , it seems natural to study these inhomogeneous systems with hubbard or @xmath8-@xmath9 hamiltonians defined on coupled ladders or quasi - one dimensional structures , with in general different fillings .",
    "after all , single ladders contains pairing , pseudogap , charge ordering ( cdw).@xcite however , these models are quite difficult to analyze , both by analytical or numerical techniques . to make this problem more manageable , effective models of bosons and fermions can be derived and studied .",
    "these models may be obtained after a basis change from the site to the dimer basis @xcite or to the plaquette basis @xcite and eventually projecting out some states of the new basis .",
    "simplified models where the hard - core bosons describing triplet excitations have been eliminated have also been studied recently.@xcite these models were originally proposed to describe bipolaronic superconductivity@xcite and later used to study the pseudogap phase in the cuprates@xcite where typically bosons represent preformed pairs . in the present work , as a difference with those earlier studies , a model in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom",

    "although pairing on stripes is a controversial issue,@xcite it is still interesting to examine a possible enhancement of superconductivity due to proximity effect within a simple lattice model . in the same way , the compounds with structural ladders could also be modeled by spatially separated bosons and fermions .",
    "bosons would describe pairs on ladders and fermions unpaired electrons on the zig - zag chains . in both cases",
    ", a relatively simple boson - fermion model could give qualitative features about , for example , the competition between superconductivity and cdw , the effect of strong electron correlations , and the effect of applied pressure which leads to the modification of couplings , site energies.@xcite    in general , these effective models will contain fermion and boson hopping terms together with some additional terms mixing bosons and fermions .",
    "one of the most important and interesting mixing term is a generalized andreev coupling which describes the breaking of a pair in two electrons or the reverse process . in section [ model ]",

    "<S> are connected to fermionic chains by two types of generalized andreev couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that for both types of couplings the long - distance pairing correlations are enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> near quarter filling , this effect is much larger for the splitting of a pair in electrons which go to the two neighboring fermionic chains than for a pair hopping process . it is argued that the pairing enhancement is a result of the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion which tunes the competition between pairing and charge ordering . </S>"
