    "-.2 in    enormous efforts have been made by geologists and physicists to understand the earthquake phenomena since several decades .",
    "its dynamics is still a challenging problem .",
    "though model studies of earthquake have been going on several decades now , there is no consensus regarding one single model . `",
    "plate - tectonics ' is an important observation in this context by the geologists and the gutenberg - richter power law is an unique characterisation of this dynamics .",
    "the earth s solid outer crust ( about 20 km thick ) rests on a tectonic shell .",
    "this tectonic shell is divided into a number ( about 12 ) of mobile plates , having relative velocities of the order of few centimeters per year .",
    "this motion of the plates arises due to the powerful convective flow of the earth s mantle , at the inner core of earth . due to the surface roughness of both the earth s crust and the plates ,",
    "solid - solid frictional forces arise and this helps sticking the earth s crust to the plates .",
    "this sticking develops elastic strains and the strain energy gradually increases because of the uniform motion of the tectonic plates .",
    "there is a competition between the sticking frictional force and the restoring elastic force ( stress ) .",
    "when the accumulated stress exceeds the frictional force , a slip ( earth quake ) occurs and it releases the stored additional elastic energy .",
    "gutenberg and richter ( 1954 ) @xcite , by analysing the records , observed a power - law distribution of the elastic energy released during earthquakes given as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of earthquakes releasing energy greater than or equal to @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the power exponent .",
    "the observed value of @xmath14 ranges between 0.7 and 1.0 . several hypothesis and model systems",
    "have been proposed to investigate the nature of the earthquake phenomena @xcite .",
    "the main intention of the model studies is to capture the above gutenberg - richter type power law for the frequency distribution of failures ( quakes ) in the failure dynamics of the models . among these , most of the models",
    "@xcite incorporate the stick - slip process and the roughness @xcite of the surfaces involved as important features .",
    "recently some models @xcite have included the fractal nature of both the earth s crust and the plate involved in stick - slip process and initiated new modellings of earthquake dynamics .",
    "as the elastic energy can be stored at the contact area of the surfaces only , the contact area distribution should have much importance .",
    "also , in fractal physics the statistics of two fractal overlap is still missing although this may be useful to study the interface properties in many physical situations .    in this report",
    "we have studied the contact area distributions and their scaling properties for different sets of fractal surfaces , using computer simulation techniques .",
    "extensive studies have already established different types of fractals and their properties @xcite .",
    "the statistics of overlaps between two such fractals is however not studied much yet , though their knowledge is often required in various physical contexts .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that since the fractured surfaces have got well - characterized self - affine properties , the distribution of the elastic energies released during the slips between two fractal surfaces ( earthquake events ) may follow the overlap distribution of two self - similar fractal surfaces @xcite . also , using renormalisation group technique chakrabarti and stinchcombe @xcite",
    "have analytically shown that for regular fractal overlap ( cantor sets and carpets ) the contact area distribution follows power law .    here , we study the distribution @xmath2 of contact area @xmath0 between two well - characterized fractals having the same fractal dimension . we have chosen different types of fractals : regular or non - random cantor sets , random cantor sets ( in one dimension ) , regular and random gaskets on square lattice and percolating clusters @xcite embedded in two dimensions .",
    "we find a universal scaling behavior of the distribution : @xmath15    where @xmath5 denotes the finite size of the fractal and the exponent @xmath8 ; @xmath1 being the mass dimension of the fractal and @xmath10 is the embedding dimension .",
    "also the overlap distribution @xmath2 , and hence the scaled distribution @xmath9 , seen to decay with @xmath0 or @xmath16 following a power law ( with exponent value equal to the embedding dimension of the fractals ) for both regular and random cantor sets and gaskets : @xmath17 for the percolating clusters , however , the overlap distribution takes a gaussian form .",
    "it may be noted that the normalisation ( to unity ) restriction on both @xmath18 and @xmath0 ensures the same scaling exponent @xmath14 for both .",
    "here we construct three types of regular fractals : regular cantor sets of dimension @xmath19 , regular cantor sets of dimension @xmath20 and regular gaskets of dimension @xmath21 on a square lattice .",
    "these regular fractals are constructed following a repetitive procedure in successive generations ( @xmath22 ) such that the self - similarity is strictly maintained at every stage .",
    "for example , a regular cantor set of dimension @xmath19 is formed in the @xmath23 limit of the set obtained by removing the middle one - third portion of each occupied set at every generation , starting from a compact set of size @xmath24 at @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . for the set with dimension @xmath20 ,",
    "one similarly removes the middle one - fifth portion at each generation ( here @xmath26 for finite @xmath22-th generation ) .",
    ".1 in    fig 1 * * : * * ( a ) a regular cantor set of dimension @xmath19 ; only three finite generations are shown .",
    "( b ) the overlap of two identical ( regular ) cantor sets , at @xmath27 , when one slips over other ; the overlap sets are indicated within the vertical lines , where periodic boundary condition has been used .",
    "( c ) a regular gasket of dimension @xmath21 at the @xmath28th generation .",
    "( d ) the overlap of two identical regular gaskets at same generations ( @xmath29 ) is shown as one is translated over the other ; periodic boundary condition has been used for the translated gasket .    to study the overlap between two such identical fractals ,",
    "the boundary effects are avoided using periodic boundary condition for one and we consider the other set to slip over the first . at each step of such slip or translation ,",
    "we count the overlapping filled sites ( black parts or dots ) present in both the fractals and the total number of such sites gives the size of overlap @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if one sequentially translates one fractal over another , various overlap values ( @xmath0 ) are obtained which in turn give the distribution @xmath2 . since no randomness is involved here , we do not need any configurational averaging .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the cantor sets and gaskets are generated for finite generations @xmath22 : @xmath24 for cantor sets with @xmath30 , @xmath26 for cantor sets with @xmath31 and @xmath32 for gaskets with @xmath33 .",
    "the overlap distributions @xmath34 are fitted to the scaling forms ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",

    "we construct three types of random fractals : random cantor sets of dimension @xmath19 , random cantor sets of dimension @xmath20 and random gaskets of dimension @xmath21 on square lattice .",
    "we can construct a random cantor set of dimension @xmath19 by removing randomly any of the one - third portion at every stage or generation ( see fig 3 ) .",

    "we study the overlap distribution of two well - characterised random fractals ; namely the percolating fractals @xcite .",
    "efficient algorithms are available to generate such fractals .",
    "it seems , although many detailed features of the clusters will change with the changes in ( parent ) fractals , the subtle features of the overlap distribution function remains unchanged .",
    "we generate numerically several site percolating clusters at the percolation threshold ( @xmath46 @xcite ) on square lattices of linear size @xmath5 using hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite . for the overlap of any two clusters ,",
    "we count the number of sites @xmath47 which are occupied in both the clusters ( see fig 5 ) .",
    "this gives the overlap size @xmath48 between the fractals .",
    "as the realisations change ( keeping the fractal dimension @xmath1 of the percolating cluster same ) @xmath0 varies and we find out its distribution @xmath34 .",
    "we find that the distribution shifts continuously as @xmath5 increases and has a finite width which diminishes but very slowly with @xmath5 .",
    "this shows , the emerging length scale associated with @xmath0 is no longer a constant , rather it depends on @xmath5 .",
    "this arises due to the fractal nature of the original clusters , where the occupation of the sites are no longer random events , but are correlated @xcite .",
    "hence , for a system of size @xmath5 , the probability of occupation grows as @xmath49 for any of the fractals and as @xmath50^{2}=l^{2(d_{f}-d ) } $ ] for the overlap set .",
    "if this is the origin of the @xmath5 dependence in @xmath34 , then the distributions for different @xmath5 should follow a scaling behavior as indicated by eqn .",
    "fig 5 : * * * * the overlap between two percolating clusters ; ( a ) and ( b ) are two typical realisations of the same percolating fractal on square lattice ( @xmath51 ) and ( c ) their overlap set .",
    "note , the overlap set need not be a connected one .",

    "the data are binned to facilitate storage and to make the distribution smooth ( fig 6 ( a ) ) .",
    "we have also studied the nature of the distribution @xmath2 for percolation clusters generated with lattice occupation probability @xmath53 above @xmath54 of the square lattice . here",
    "the distributions become delta functions and the height of the delta function increases with system size @xmath5 ( fig 6 ( b ) ) .",

    "the dotted line indicates the best fit curve of the form @xmath59 ; where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) are constants .",

    "clearly the distributions @xmath2 are delta functions and the height of the delta function increases with the system size @xmath5 .",
    "in the context of studying the earthquake magnitude distribution , we have studied here a model where the earthquake fault and the moving tectonic plates are assumed to be self - similar fractals . essentially , we study the contact area distribution of two nominally identical fractals .",
    "our study on different sets of fractal surface overlap shows that the contact area distributions are not always power laws .",
    "although for cantor sets and gaskets having different fractal dimensions ( both for regular and random cases ) , the contact area distributions have got power laws , for percolating clusters ( at percolation threshold ) it takes a robust gaussian form which we ca nt explain even qualitatively .",
    "in particular , we find that in all the cases the distributions @xmath34 show an universal finite size ( @xmath5 ) scaling behavior @xmath6 ; @xmath7 , where @xmath8 . the @xmath2 , and consequently the scaled distribution @xmath9 , have got a power law ( 2 ) decay with @xmath0 ( with decay exponent equal to @xmath10 ) for both regular and random cantor sets and also for gaskets . for percolation clusters , @xmath2 ( and hence @xmath9 )",
    "have a gaussian variation with @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "it may be mentioned that , since in many cases the bulk thermodynamics may be mapped to some reduced dimensional interface problems and since their overlaps corresponds to physical quantities ( e.g. , the replica overlap in the physics of glasses @xcite ) , such fractal overlap distributions are of quite general interest .",
