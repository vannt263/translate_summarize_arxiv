    "the complex langevin method solves in principle the sign problems arising in simulations of various systems , in particular in qcd with finite chemical potential . after being proposed in the early 1980s by klauder @xcite and parisi @xcite",
    ", it enjoyed a certain limited popularity @xcite , but very quickly certain problems were found .",
    "the first one was instability of the simulations with absence of convergence ( runaways ) , the second one convergence to a wrong limit @xcite .",
    "nevertheless in recent years the method has been revived with sometimes impressive success @xcite .",
    "in particular the use of adaptive stepsize has eliminated the problem of runaways @xcite .",
    "but nagging problems remained due to the lack of clear criteria to decide when an apparently convergent simulation actually represented the truth .",
    "this was linked to the lack of a clear mathematical basis for the method , that would at the same time also provide criteria for its applicability .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify the situation at least to some extent .",
    "while we are still not able to close certain mathematical gaps and reach a complete analytic solution to the problems that have plagued the method , we give some strong numerical evidence that the method is correct in some cases and also suggest a plausible explanation for the failure in other cases ; this leads to some pragmatic conclusions suggesting how to proceed in practice in a way that promises credible results .",

    "but these complications are not really relevant for our discussion .    as is well known , the idea is to simulate a complex measure @xmath6 , with @xmath7 a holomorphic function on a real manifold @xmath8 , by setting up a stochastic process on the complexification @xmath9 of @xmath8 , such that the expectation values of _ entire holomorphic observables _",

    "formally ( i.e.  without worrying about boundary terms and existence questions ) this works as follows : first we use the fact that we want to apply the complex fp operators @xmath43 only to functions that have analytic continuations to all of @xmath9 . on those analytic continuations",
    "we may act with the langevin operator l _ z , whose action on holomorphic functions agrees with that of @xmath26 , since on such functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 so that the difference @xmath46 vanishes",

    ".    we now use @xmath48 to evolve the observables by the equation [ obsevol ] _ t o(z;t)=",
    "l o(z;t)(t0 ) with the initial condition @xmath50 , which is formally solved by [ obssol ] o(z;t ) = o(z ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ obsevol ] , [ obssol ] ) , because of the cr equations , the tilde may be dropped , and we will do so now .",

    "l o(z;t)(t0 ) , with its formal solution [ obssol2 ] o(z;t ) = o(z ) .",

    "l_y_0 o(x+iy_0;t)(t0 ) y_0 . the first thing to notice is that @xmath51 will be holomorphic if @xmath52 is .",
    "this can be seen as follows : let @xmath53 @xmath54 be the cauchy - riemann operators defined by    the fact that by the holomorphy of @xmath7 @xmath53 commutes with @xmath26 , we find [ crobsevol ] _",

    "so @xmath51 is holomorphic in each component @xmath61 separately . by hartogs theorem",

    "the first equality is obvious , while the second one can be seen as follows , using eqs .",
    "( [ init ] , [ obssol2 ] ) , @xmath63 where we only had to assume that we can integrate by parts in @xmath64 without worrying about boundary terms .",
    "our desired result follows if we can show that @xmath65 is independent of @xmath66 . to see this , we differentiate @xmath67 integration by parts",
    "then shows that the two terms cancel , hence @xmath68 and thus [ equival ] o_p(t)= o_(t ) .",
    "it is important to notice that this holds for all @xmath20 ; whereas the left hand side seems to depend on @xmath20 , the right hand side is manifestly independent of it .    if we knew in addition that [ conv ] _",
    "t o_(t ) = o _ ( ) , with @xmath69 given by eq .",
    "( [ rhostat ] ) with @xmath70 , we could now conclude that the expectation values of the langevin process relax to the desired values ; this convergence would follow if we knew that the spectrum of @xmath71 lies in a half plane @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a nondegenerate eigenvalue .",
    "but note that we do not really need convergence of @xmath28 for eq .",
    "( [ conv ] ) to hold , since it will only be tested against analytic observables @xmath10 .",
    "nevertheless the numerical evidence in many cases points to the existence of a unique stationary probability density @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding probability currents are divergenceless , but unlike the situation in the real langevin process , they can not vanish . a general feature of the stationary distribution that can be read off the fpe is the following :",
    "assume that @xmath75 is a local stationary point of @xmath42 , then ( n_r_x+n_i_y)p = _ x ( k_xp)+_y ( k_y p ) , for @xmath76 .",
    "so if @xmath77 , a local maximum of @xmath42 can only occur where the divergence of the drift force is negative and a minimum where it is positive . for @xmath78",
    "the conclusion is even stronger : where the divergence is negative ( positive ) , there can not be a local minimum ( maximum ) in @xmath64 for fixed @xmath79 .",
    "these properties provide some checks on numerical solutions .",
    "there are three main questions raised by the formal arguments in the previous section :    \\(1 ) can the operators @xmath80 and their transposes be exponentiated ; in more mathematical language : do these operators generate semigroups on some suitable space of functions ?",
    "\\(2 ) are the various integrations by parts justified , which underlie the shifting of the time evolution from the measure to the observables and back , or are there boundary terms to worry about ?",
    "\\(3 ) are the spectra of @xmath81 and their transposes entirely in the left half plane and is 0 a nondegenerate eigenvalue ?    concerning the first question , there are treatises ( see for instance refs.@xcite ) giving rather general sufficient conditions for the existence of a semigroup generated by differential operators of the general type considered here .",
    "unfortunately it seems that the cases we have to deal with here are not covered by those general results ; the main difficulties are ( 1 ) the strong growth of the drift given by the gradients of the action in some complex directions and ( 2 ) the fact that the drift is not always ` restoring ' .",
    "question ( 1 ) for @xmath82 is intimately related to the question whether the stochastic process given by the complex langevin equation exists for arbitrary long times .",
    "this is not obvious because typically in the classical ( no noise ) limit there are trajectories that go to infinity in finite time .",
    "while those trajectories occur only for a subset of measure zero of initial conditions , it is not obvious what happens after adding the noise . on the one hand",
    ", the noise will typically kick the process away from the unstable trajectories ; on the other hand it may also kick it near the unstable trajectory , inducing very large excursions of the process .",
    "we will later illustrate this with some examples .    but let us say that the accumulated numerical evidence points not only to the existence of the process for arbitrarily large times , but also to the existence of a unique equilibrium measure for the process ; unfortunately we could neither find results in the mathematical literature that would imply this , nor could we prove ourselves that this is the case .",
    "concerning the exponentiation of @xmath83 , which should be easier , we still could not establish mathematically that it is possible on a space of functions containing the most obvious observables , such as exponentials .    there is a useful criterion for the existence of a bounded semigroup generated by an operator @xmath84 on a hilbert space @xcite : @xmath84 generates a bounded semigroup if it is _ dissipative _ , i.e. if @xmath85 .",
    "unfortunately even in the simplest cases of a quadratic @xmath7 the corresponding langevin and fp operators are _ not _ dissipative .",
    "so they can at best generate exponentially bounded semigroups ; if in addition the spectrum is in the left half plane , convergence to the equilibrium should still take place .    for the second question it would be necessary to have good control over the falloff of the solutions of the fpe in the imaginary directions : if we insert the observables @xmath86 into eq .",
    "( [ equival ] ) , we get for the fourier transform ( fourier coefficients in the compact case ) @xmath87 of the complex density @xmath88 ( k;t ) = p(x , y;t ) e^ikx - ky dxdy .",
    "this makes sense for all @xmath89 _ only _ if @xmath28 decays more strongly than any exponential in imaginary direction .",
    "our case studies described in the following sections indicate that this does not seem to be the case : in our first example the decay is probably exponential , but not stronger ; in our second example the decay seems to be even weaker ( @xmath90 with @xmath91 ) , so that exponentials can not be used as observables .",
    "the remainder of the paper is mainly devoted to studying question ( 2 ) in some toy models .    finally let us remark that the third question is more difficult than the first one , and again the answer is not known rigorously . but again the numerical evidence strongly suggests a positive answer , depending on the model and the parameter values , in many interesting and relevant cases ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "in this paper we are mainly concerned with question ( 2 ) .",
    "even though we have very little analytic control , careful numerical studies reveal that , as remarked , the answer is generally _ no _ ! in our case studies we find indications that the probability density @xmath28 indeed relaxes to an equilibrium density @xmath74 , but that that limiting density decays at best like an exponential for @xmath92 , in other cases only power - like .",
    "this limits the class of observables for which the integrations by parts can be performed without boundary terms .    but let us first take a closer look at the integrations by parts that occur in the formal arguments of sec .",
    "[ secii ] .",
    "the danger lies in a possibly insufficient falloff in the imaginary ( @xmath79 ) directions , whereas in the real ( @xmath64 ) direction we have either compactness or sufficient falloff due to the behaviour of the action @xmath7 .",
    "let us remark that for @xmath77 the operators @xmath26 and @xmath29 are uniformly strictly elliptic ; this is important , because it implies regularity for any solution of the stationary fpe @xcite .",
    "it is also to be expected that the semigroup @xmath93 has a smooth ( even real analytic ) kernel so that for @xmath94 @xmath28 will be smooth ( real analytic ) .",
    "this is supported by our numerical studies .",
    "so the problematic point is to show that the two terms on right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ interpol ] ) actually cancel .",
    "this may fail because the observables @xmath10 typically grow in imaginary direction , whereas the decay of @xmath28 ( always assuming it exists ) may be insufficient to compensate for it .    let us see in a little more detail how the argument for the independence of @xmath20 may fail . for simplicity of presentation",
    "we consider the one - dimensional case ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "we write the langevin operator ( [ eq : lo ] ) as l = l_n_i=0+n_i , where @xmath96 is the langevin operator for @xmath97 .",
    "then let us consider @xmath98 we use the formula e^tl^t= _ 0^t d e^l^te^(t-)l^t , and integration by parts to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ noisedep ] ) as _ 0^t dp(x , y;t- ) o(x+iy ; ) dxdy + x. the term denoted by @xmath99 collects possible boundary terms arising in the integration by parts .",
    "it vanishes only if the decay of @xmath100 is strong enough to offset any possible growth of @xmath101 ; otherwise it may either converge to a finite nonzero value or diverge . by the cr equations",
    "the first term vanishes , but the uncontrolled boundary term @xmath99 remains .",
    "let us look at a simple example that shows how and when the formal argument fails .",
    "consider @xmath102 ( where the second term vanishes on account of the cr equations ) . by the formal argument this would be zero , being just a boundary term , but careful application of integration by parts , at first over the finite domain @xmath103 , gives @xmath104 \\big|_{-y_-}^{y_+}.   & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here it is clear that what matters is the combined asymptotic behaviour of @xmath42 and @xmath10 , and depending on the observable , @xmath99 may be zero , finite , or divergent .",
    "of course the form of the boundary terms is less simple when using integration by parts in eqs .",
    "( [ interpol],[noisedep ] ) , but we expect that it is still the decay of the products like @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 that is relevant .    when trying to investigate the effects of the boundary numerically , one would in principle like to use the probability density obtained without a cutoff .",
    "in practice this is , however , not feasible , and we therefore introduce a cutoff in the imaginary direction , which is not sent to infinity .",
    "such a device is necessary for the solution of the fpe , and even though the cle does not require it , for the purpose of comparison we also introduce it there .",
    "this will , however , introduce additional problems with the formal arguments relying on the cr equations as well as integration by parts .",
    "concretely we proceed as follows : we restrict each @xmath108 to lie between @xmath109 and @xmath110 and impose periodic boundary conditions on both the observables and the probability densities .",
    "this has a number of consequences .",
    "firstly , observables @xmath111 will in general not be continuous across the ` seam ' , where we identify @xmath112 with @xmath113 .",
    "they can therefore not be interpreted as continuous functions and a priori the it formula ( [ ito ] ) does not hold ( it may still hold in the sense of distributions , which should be sufficient for our purposes ) .",
    "furthermore , the jump across the seam will mean that the cr equations are no longer satisfied everywhere .",
    "for the evolved observables the cr equations can not be expected to hold anywhere exactly , as the violation that occurred initially only at the boundary gets propagated everywhere by the langevin evolution .",
    "similarly , the drift in the fpe is expected to be discontinuous at the seam .",
    "therefore we have to expect that @xmath42 has a jump there as well ; this in turn forces us to interpret the fpe in the sense of distributions",
    ".    one might wonder whether it would not be better to limit the fluctuations in the imaginary direction by introducing a smooth cutoff ;",
    "but since such a smooth cutoff function will necessarily be nonholomorphic it will destroy the formal arguments even more ; we therefore stick with the simplest choice of a periodic cutoff .",
    "we conclude therefore that the introduction of a cutoff @xmath114 and imposing periodic boundary conditions leads to a breakdown of the formal arguments given in sec .",
    "[ secii ] .",
    "although it is difficult to quantify precisely the effect of this , it seems reasonable to expect that it is still the behavior of @xmath105 and similar products at large @xmath115 that determines what is happening . for the cle it is also clear that a very large cutoff will practically not be felt , because the system very rarely will make contact with it .",
    "this is borne out by our numerics which clearly shows convergence to the limit of infinite cutoff .",
    "for the fpe , on the other hand the issue is less clear , because there are very large boundary terms arising from the gradients of the drift across the ` seam ' . in any case , for the fpe we can not directly compare with the cutoff - free results , because these do not exist .",
    "to understand in more detail how boundary terms affect the behaviour of complex langevin simulations , we studied in some detail the u(1 ) one - link model in the hopping ( hdm ) approximation that was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath78 .",
    "the action is s =- z -(z - i)= - a(z - ic ) , with a= , c=. the complex drift force is correspondingly @xmath116 and the two components of the drift read @xmath117 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite there are two fixed points at @xmath118 and @xmath119 ; the first one is attractive , the second one repulsive .",
    "a special feature of this model is that for @xmath120 the drift is purely in @xmath64 direction .",
    "if in addition @xmath78 , the langevin process will never leave the line @xmath120 if it starts there ( we emphasize that the properties discussed in this paragraph do not hold for the full u(1 ) one - link model , which was studied in detail in ref .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to find an explicit solution to the stationary fpe , [ fpesol ] p(x , y ; ) e^-s(x+ic)(y - c ) .",
    "it follows that this model is actually equivalent to one with a real action , once we shift @xmath121 and replace @xmath122 by @xmath123 ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 now embody the dependence on the parameters of the model ) .",
    "the numerics presented below show that the line @xmath120 is an attractor for the langevin process ; this indicates that the solution ( [ fpesol ] ) is unique ( with proper normalization ) .",
    "these properties imply that for @xmath78 the dynamics is completely understood .    when @xmath77 , the presence of the repulsive fixed point is responsible for the occurrence of large excursions , which are well known to be the scourge of complex langevin simulations .",
    "for large @xmath79 the drift terms dominate over the noise , and the langevin process is essentially just a deterministic motion ; the ` classical ' trajectories are given by z(t)=i+ic , where the complex integration constant @xmath125 is related to the starting point by c= ( ) .",
    "it is easy to see that all trajectories , except those starting on the unstable trajectories ( @xmath126 ) are attracted to the stable fixed point at @xmath127 .    as an illustration we show in fig .",
