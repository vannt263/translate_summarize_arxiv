    "josephson - junction qubits are known to be candidates for scalable solid - state quantum computing circuits @xcite . here",
    "we consider a supercobducting flux qubit which has been first proposed in @xcite and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the qubit consists of three josephson junctions in a loop with very small inductance  @xmath0 , typically in the ph range .",
    "this insures effective decoupling from the environment .",
    "however , in the practical implementation of flux qubit circuitry it is important to have the loop inductance as much as possible consistent with a proper operation of a qubit .",
    "a relative large loop inductance facilitates a qubit control biasing schemes and the formation , control and readout of two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "these considerations stimulated some investigations of the role the loop inductance plays in the operation of a flux qubit @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these works was the calculation of the corrections to the energy levels due to finite inductance of the loop . in the early work @xcite these corrections",
    "have been obtained by perturbation expansion of the energy over small parameter @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the josephson junction inductance .",
    "the extension to large @xmath3 s ( up to @xmath4 ) had been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to realize that for finite loop inductance the interaction between two state qubit with its own lc circuit can not in general be neglected .",
    "if @xmath3 is not small , as in @xcite , this interaction can have substantial influence on the energy levels .",
    "unfortunately , this interaction in @xcite has been completely neglected .    in principle , the account for a finite loop inductance ( even if it is small ) requires the correct construction of quantum mechanical hamiltonian of a qubit , which contains all relevant interactions .",
    "this has been done in @xcite , where the effective hamiltonian has been obtained by a rigorous expansion procedure in powers of @xmath3 . as was shown in @xcite , one of the effect of the interaction of a flux qubit with its own lc oscillator",
    "is the renormalization of the josephson critical current .",
    "the inclusion of circuit inductances in a systematic derivation of the hamiltonian of superconducting circuits has been done in @xcite .",
    "it allows the correct calculations of the effects of the finite inductance both for flux @xcite and charge @xcite qubits .    in this paper",
    "we investigate another physical effect which comes from finite loop inductance .",
    "namely , we show that the finite loop inductance results in the additional term of the current operator in the flux basis : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are pauli matrices in the flux basis . the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 in ( [ cop ] ) are calculated in the paper the @xmath9 being conditioned by the finite loop inductance : for @xmath10 the second term in ( [ cop ] ) is absent .",
    "though for the usual qubit design with small loop inductance this second term is relatively small , nevertheless , it might give noticeable effects for large @xmath3 s for the arrangements when two flux qubit are coupled either via a common inductance @xcite or inductively coupled via a term @xmath11 in the hamiltonian , where @xmath12 is a mutual inductance between qubit s loops , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the current operators of the respective qubits .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we start with the exact lagrangian of a flux qubit with finite loop inductance . in section iii with the aid of well known procedure we derive rigorously the quantum qubit hamiltonian .",
    "the current operator is studied in section iv , where we show that in general it is not diagonal in the flux basis .",
    "the matrix elements for the current operator are calculated in section vi , where in order to obtain analytical results we consider a flux qubit with a small loop inductance .",
    "we consider here a well known design of the flux qubit with three josephson junctions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , which is shown on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "two junctions have equal critical current @xmath15 and ( effective ) capacitance  @xmath16 , while those of the third junction are slightly smaller : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "if the josephson energy @xmath20 is much larger than the coulomb energy @xmath21 , the josephson phase is well defined .",
    "near @xmath22 , this system has two low - lying quantum states @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of this qubit is the difference between the charge energy in the junction capacitors and the sum of josephson and magnetic energy :",
    "@xmath23    where @xmath24 is the voltage across the junction capacitance @xmath25 , which is related to the phase @xmath26 by the josephson relation @xmath27 ; @xmath28 is the flux trapped in the loop :    @xmath29    next we make the following definitions : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . in terms of these new phases",
    "lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "conjugate variables are defined in a standard way :",
    "@xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    from these equations we express phases in terms of conjugate variables : @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    in terms of conjugate variables lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) takes the form : @xmath41 the hamiltonian is constructed according to the well known rule : @xmath42 finally we obtain : @xmath43 where @xmath44    hence , equations of motion for the phases ( [ motion1 ] ) , ( [ motion2 ] ) , ( [ motion3 ] ) are simply @xmath45 .",
    "the equations of motion for conjugate variables are : @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 below we consider hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) as quantum mechanical with commutator relations imposed on its variables @xmath49 = i;\\quad \\left [ { \\theta , n_\\theta   } \\right ] = i;\\quad \\left [ { \\chi , n_\\chi   } \\right ] = i\\ ] ]",
    "from the first principles a current in the loop is equal to the first derivative of the state energy relative to external flux : @xmath50 this expression can be rewritten in terms of exact hamiltonian of a system : @xmath51 from ( [ currb ] ) we would make ansatz that the current operator is as follows : @xmath52 however ( [ currc ] ) is not a consequence of ( [ currb ] ) .",
    "therefore , the ansatz ( [ currc ] ) must be proved in every case , since the current operator in the form of eq .",
    "( [ currc ] ) has to be consistent with its definition in terms of variables of hamiltonian @xmath53 .",
    "the prove for our case is given below .",
    "the current operator across every junction is a sum of a supercurrent and a current through the capacitor : @xmath54 @xmath55 since the current in a loop is unique the equations ( [ curr1 ] ) and ( [ curr2 ] ) must give identical result .",
    "this is indeed the case if we express phases @xmath56 in terms of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and use the equations ( [ motion1 ] ) , ( [ motion2 ] ) , ( [ motion3 ] ) , ( [ conj1 ] ) , ( [ conj2 ] ) , ( [ conj3 ] ) . for every @xmath60 in ( [ curr1 ] ) , ( [ curr2 ] )",
    "we obtain the same expression @xmath61 which is independent of parameters of a particular junction in the loop . from the other hand the expression ( [ currop1 ] ) can be obtained from our hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) with the aid of ( [ currc ] ) .",
    "therefore , the equation ( [ currc ] ) gives us the true expression for the current operator .",
    "it is important to note that the proper expression for the current operator ( [ currop1 ] ) can not be obtained without magnetic energy term in the original lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ ham2 ] ) and ( [ currop1 ] ) that @xmath62 \\ne 0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , an eigenstate of @xmath53 can not possess a definite current value .",
    "suppose a system is well described by two low lying states @xmath63 with corresponding eigenenergies @xmath64 : @xmath65 within this subspace hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of pauli matrices @xmath66 : @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "now we calculate the matrix elements of the current operator ( [ currc ] ) within this subspace . according to ( [ curra]),([currb ] ) and ( [ currc ] ) diagonal matrix elements",
    "are : @xmath69 in order to find nondiagonal matrix elements of the current operator we use the expression @xmath70 which is obtained by differentiating of the identity @xmath71 with respect to parameter @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the nondiagonal elements of the current operator are : @xmath73 therefore , we can express the current operator in terms of pauli matrices : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the unity matrix .",
    "below we consider two low lying states of a flux qubit @xmath76 where @xmath77 and the tunneling rate @xmath78 are independent of the external flux @xmath79 , and the quantity @xmath80 is linear function of the flux , @xmath81 , where @xmath72 is a numerical factor which depends on qubit parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , for the flux qubit we get in eigenstate basis : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "transformation to the flux basis is obtained via the rotation around @xmath88 axes in a two level subspace with the aid of the matrix @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 are pauli matrices in a flux basis .",
    "hence , we get for hamiltonian ( [ ham3 ] ) and current operator ( [ currop3 ] ) in the flux basis : @xmath95 @xmath96    therefore , the current operator is not diagonal neither in the flux basis nor in the eigenstate basis .",
    "the stationary state wave functions @xmath97 can be written as the superpositions of the wave functions in the flux basis , @xmath98 where @xmath0 , @xmath99 stand for the left , right well , respectively : @xmath100 , where @xmath101 the coefficients @xmath102 , @xmath103 are defined in such a way , that @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 . in terms of the functions @xmath98 the cross term @xmath108 will read @xmath109    the results obtained up till now are exact in that we did not make any approximation to the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) . however , in order to calculate @xmath80 and cross term @xmath110 in ( [ currop3 ] ) , ( [ currop4 ] ) we need some approximate procedure .",
    "in order to calculate the matrix elements of the current operator we have to find the wave functions of two lowest levels of hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) .",
    "first we single out of the potential ( [ poten ] ) the fast variable @xmath111 , which describe the interaction of the qubit with its own @xmath112 circuit .",
    "the point of minimum @xmath113 of @xmath114 ( [ poten ] ) with respect to @xmath111 is defined from @xmath115 : @xmath116 in the vicinity of @xmath113 the potential @xmath117 can be written as : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a small operator correction to @xmath113 : @xmath120 .",
    "as is known the potential @xmath121 has a degenerate point at @xmath22 .",
    "assuming @xmath122 , @xmath123 we obtain near this point : @xmath124 from ( [ currop1 ] ) and ( [ phic1 ] ) we find a current operator in `` coordinate '' representation : @xmath125 for @xmath121 we obtain near degeneracy point @xmath126 below we follow the procedure described in @xcite . at @xmath127 , the potential  ( [ potdeg ] )",
    "has two minima at @xmath128 , @xmath129 , with @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "tunnelling lifts their degeneracy , leading to energy levels @xmath132 .",
    "however , at degenerate bias the current vanishes , forcing one to move slightly away from this point . in order to find the levels for @xmath133 we expand eq .",
    "( [ potdeg ] ) near its minima , retaining linear terms in @xmath134 , @xmath3 and quadratic terms in @xmath135 .",
    "define @xmath136 as the minima , shifted due to @xmath134 and @xmath3 : @xmath137 that is , the upper ( lower ) sign refers to the right ( left ) well .",
    "the potential energy ( [ potdeg ] ) then reads : @xmath138 where the operator correction @xmath139 , @xmath140        combining ( [ potquadr ] ) and ( [ potdeg ] ) in ( [ ham2 ] ) we obtain quadratic quantum mechanical hamiltonian for the flux qubit in the left and right well near the degeneracy point : @xmath143 + \\left [ { 2e_c \\hat n_\\chi ^2   + e_j a^{r / l}\\hat \\chi ^2 } \\right ] \\\\",

    "the next two terms in square brackets are oscillator hamiltonians for the flux qubit variables , @xmath59 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the interaction of the @xmath58 degree of freedom with the qubit @xmath112 circuit is given by next - to - last term in ( [ hamquant ] ) .",

    "this is equivalent to the averaging of hamiltonian ( [ hamquant ] ) over the ground state of the lc hamiltonian .",
