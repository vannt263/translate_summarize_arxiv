    "( for more on the various attempts and theorems along the way also see @xcite . )",
    "so it was with great joy that we realized that ideas developed by the other author in the 1980 s @xcite , summarized and extended as theorem 2 , would prove of theorem 1 .",
    "* the main idea behind the proof of theorem  [ th_2 ] . *    the solutions described by theorem 2 arise out of chaotic perturbations of the homothetic solutions of euler and lagrange .",
    "we recall that the solutions of euler and lagrange are precisely those solutions to newton s equations whose shape does not change as they evolve .",
    "when projected onto the shape sphere such a solution curve is a single constant point .",
    "there are five points in all .",
    "they are called central configurations and denoted here @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 are euler s collinear configurations .",
    "@xmath36 lies on the collinear arc marked @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath37 are lagrange s central configurations and are equilateral triangles , with one for each possible orientation of a labelled equilateral triangle in the plane .",
    "each central configuration gives rise to a family of solutions , the family being parameterized by an auxiliary kepler problem , i.e. , by conics . for each choice of conic the corresponding solution",
    "consists of the three masses travelling along homographic ( = scaled , rotated ) versions of this conic , with the conics placed so that one focus is the center of mass of the three bodies .",
    "the masses travel their individual conics in such a way that the triangle they form remains in a constant shape . at fixed energy",
    "we can think of the parameter as the angular momentum .",
    "the homothetic solutions correspond to angular momentum zero and are degenerate conics . for these solutions",
    "the three bodies move along collinear rays , exploding out of triple collision until they reach a maximum size ( dependent on the energy ) at which instant they are all instantaneously at rest . from that instant",
    "they reverse their paths , shrinking back homothetically to triple collision . when the angular momentum is turned on to be small but near zero , the masses move along highly eccentric nearly collinear ellipses",
    ". see figure [ fig_eccentriccentral ] .",
    "the solutions of theorem 2 feature many close approaches to triple collision .",
    "while they are away from collision they look much like the eulerian homothetic solutions  the bodies are close to one of the three eulerian central configurations @xmath36 while the size expands and then contracts again to another close approach to triple collision . near collision , however , their behavior is quite different . the shape begins to oscillate around the collinear shape , producing a large syzygy block @xmath38 . very close to collision the shape approaches one of the two lagrange equilateral triangles",
    "the transitions from @xmath36 to @xmath40 or @xmath41 are through isosceles shapes ( the circular arcs in figure  [ fig_skeleton ] ) .",
    "one can specify a transition to either @xmath40 or to @xmath41 at each close approach . after the shape is nearly equilateral",
    ", the triangle spins around ( similar to the behavior near collision of the lagragian homographic solution in figure  [ fig_eccentriccentral ] ) .",
    "next , the shape makes a transition back to one of the eulerian central configuration @xmath42 , following one of the three isosceles circles .",
    "arriving near @xmath42 the shape oscillates and the size starts to increase again .",
    "away from collision , the behavior is like the euler homothetic solution with shape @xmath42 .",
    "the main point is that , during each approach to collision , we can choose which lagrange configuration to approach and then which eulerian homothetic orbit to mimic next . in this way we can concatenate the three types of syzygy blocks at will .",
    "note that the arrangement of the three isosceles half - circles in figure  [ fig_skeleton ] has the same free homotopy type as the sphere minus three points . by following the dark lines of figure [ fig_skeleton ] we can realize every reduced free homotopy class .",
    "the results of @xcite allow us to make the necessary transitions near the poles from one kind of eulerian behavior to the other .",
    "what was not explicitly said there , but follows from the proof , is that when the masses are nearly equal these realizing solutions , when projected to the shape sphere , stay within a small neighborhood of the isosceles half - circles .",
    "this prevents the occurrence of additional , unintended syzygies and also allows us to avoid binary collisions .",
    "there are a number of reasons we need some angular momentum to achieve the gluing of the three half - circles . without angular momentum ,",
    "the isosceles problems are invariant sub - problems and so we can not switch from one circle to another .",
    "sundman s theorem asserts that triple collision is impossible when the angular momentum is not zero , hence some angular momentum relieves us of the inconvenience of investigating whether or not solutions  die \" in triple collision .",
    "but the most important reason is that we need the lagrange - like spinning behavior near triple collision to connect up the orbit segments approaching collision with those receding from it .",
    "see figure [ fig_loop ] where this spinning behavior appears as a restpoint connection at @xmath33 .",
    "this mechanism is described in more detail in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will describe how theorem  [ th_2 ] follows from previous results on constructing chaotic invariant sets for the planar three - body problem with small , nonzero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "these results , in turn , are based on a study of the isosceles three - body problem , so we begin there .",
    "when two of the three masses are equal , there is an invariant subsystem of the planar three - body problem consisting of solutions for which the shape of the triangle formed by the three bodies remains isosceles for all time .",
    "all of these solutions have zero angular momentum . after fixing the center of mass ,",
    "the isosceles subsystem has two degrees of freedom so fixing the energy gives a three - dimensional flow . in the early eighties",
    ", there were several papers published about this interesting problem @xcite .",
    "we will describe a few features relevant to syzygy problem , referring to @xcite for more details . in order to be definite ,",
    "let us suppose that we are thinking of @xmath43 so that mass 3 forms the vertex of the isosceles triangles .    the orbits of interest pass near triple collision .",
    "using mcgehee s blow - up method , we replace the triple collision singularity by an invariant manifold forming a two - dimensional boundary to each three - dimensional energy surface .",
    "the blow - up method involves introducing size and shape variables @xmath30 and @xmath44 and corresponding momenta @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the size @xmath30 of the triangle is the square root of the moment of inertia with respect to the center of mass .",
    "thus @xmath33 represents triple collision of the three masses at their center of mass .",
    "a change of timescale by a factor of @xmath47 slows down the orbits near collision and gives rise to a well - defined limiting flow at @xmath33 .",
    "the blown - up equations read @xmath48 together with the energy constraint @xmath49 here @xmath50 $ ] parameterizes the isosceles great circle in shape space for the two equal masses , and so describes the shape of the isosceles triangle . the boundary of the @xmath44-interval , @xmath51 , represent binary collision between the two equal masses .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details regarding @xmath52 .",
    "as @xmath44 runs over @xmath53 $ ] , the triangle opens up , becoming equilateral at a certain angle @xmath54 and collinear at @xmath55 , then passing through another equilateral shape at @xmath56 before collapsing to binary collision again .",
    "the equilateral and collinear shapes are the lagrangian ( @xmath39 ) and eulerian @xmath57 central configurations .",
    "the triple collision orbits of the three - body problem , isosceles or not , converge to a central configuration .",
    "for each central configuration , there are two restpoints on the associated full collision manifold , one associated to solutions converging to that limiting shrinking shape , the other exploding out of it .",
    "the isosceles collision manifold forms an invariant submanifold of the full planar collision manifold , discussed in the next subsection . for the isosceles subproblem",
    "we have a total of six rest points denoted @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath57 .",
    "( the notation is different in @xcite . )",
    "isosceles solutions having triple collision in forward time converge to one of the restpoints @xmath61 as the rescaled time tends to infinity .",
    "in other words , they form the stable manifolds of these three restpoints .",
    "similarly , orbits colliding in backward time ( ejection orbits ) are represented by the unstable manifolds of @xmath62 . in the figure ,",
    "there are connecting orbits running from the ejection restpoints to the corresponding collision restpoints .",
    "these are the well - known homothetic solutions where the shape remains constantly equal to one of the central configurations while the size expands from @xmath33 to some maximum and then contracts to zero again .",
    "the six restpoints in the collision manifold are all hyperbolic and the dimensions of their stable and unstable manifolds are apparent from figure [ fig_isosceles ] . within",
    "the two - dimensional collision manifold @xmath33 , the lagragian restpoints are saddles with one - dimensional stable and unstable manifolds . in the three - dimensional energy manifold",
    "the starred restpoints pick up an extra stable dimension while the unstarred ones pick up an extra unstable dimension .",
    "thus @xmath63 and @xmath64 are two - dimensional surfaces . the lagrangian homothetic connecting orbits represent transverse intersections of these surfaces . within the collision manifold , @xmath65 is a repeller and @xmath57 is an attractor .",
    "viewed within the three - dimesional energy manifold , @xmath57 and @xmath59 pick up an extra stable and unstable dimension , respectively . clearly",
    "the @xmath66 connecting orbit , passing as it does through the interior of the isosceles phase space , is not a transverse intersection of stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "this connecting orbit represents the euler homothety orbit .",
    "a crucial fact for us is that the eulerian restpoints have nonreal eigenvalues within the collision manifold for a large open set of masses , including those near equal masses .",
    "this spiraling , together with the presence of restpoint connections in the collision manifold , causes the surfaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 to wrap like scrolls around the @xmath66 homothetic orbit as indicated in the figure . to get a simpler picture of these scrolls",
    ", we use a piece of the plane @xmath67 as a cross - section to the flow near the homothetic orbit .",
    "the origin of @xmath68 represents the euler homothetic orbit .",
    "the surfaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 intersect @xmath68 in spiraling curves .",
    "more precisely ( see @xcite ) , in polar coordinates @xmath69 near the origin , each such curve is parametrized by the polar angle @xmath70 by setting @xmath71 where @xmath72 is some strictly monotonic function : the curves wind monotonically around the origin .",
    "figure  [ fig_spirals ] shows the cross - section @xmath68 together with a schematic drawing of the four spiraling curves .",
    "the curves representing @xmath63 spiral in opposite directions from those representing @xmath64 .",
    "the four curves are related by reflection symmetries .",
    "namely , let @xmath73 and @xmath74 . then @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "it follows that there must be infinitely many intersection of each of the unstable manifolds with each of the stable ones .",
    "since the manifolds are real analytic , these intersections are either transverse or , at worst , finite - order tangencies .",
    "even a finite - order crossing is  topologically transverse \" and this is enough for the topological construction given later on .",
    "we have found infinitely many topologically transverse intersections of lagrangian ejection and collision orbits .",
    "these orbits behave qualitatively as follows . beginning near one of the lagrange ejection restpoints",
    "@xmath39 they follow a connecting orbit in the collision manifold to a neighborhood of the eulerian ejection rest point @xmath57 .",
    "then they follow the eulerian homothetic orbit until they are close to the eulerian collision restpoint @xmath65 . finally , they follow another connecting orbit in the collision manifold to end at collision at one of the restpoints @xmath77    so far",
    ", this subsection has summarized previous work on the isosceles problem . for the syzygy problem",
    ", we will need a few new observations .",
    "the claim is that this type of orbit has a syzygy sequence of the form @xmath78 for some large value of @xmath10 and , moreover , any sufficiently large @xmath10 can be achieved in this way . to see this",
    ", first note that the connecting orbits @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the collision manifold go directly from the equilateral to collinear shapes , staying far from double collision and far from any syzygy other than type @xmath1 .    to study syzygies of type @xmath1 recall that the collinear shape is represented in our @xmath81",
    "coordinates by the plane @xmath82 , which in the plane @xmath68 of figure [ fig_spirals ] is represented by the @xmath46-axis .",
    "the plane @xmath83 contains the eulerian restpoints and eulerian homothetic orbit . due to the spiraling at the restpoints ,",
    "it is clear that our orbits will have a large number of type @xmath1 syzygies .",
    "it is also clear that the number is odd for connections @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it remains to show than any sufficiently large number of syzygies can be achieved .",
    "one of the differential equations for the blown - up isosceles problem is @xmath86 .",
    "thus , except for the euler homothetic orbit , orbits cross the syzygy plane transversely . in figure  [ fig_isosceles ]",
    "orbits in the front half of the energy manifold ( @xmath87 ) are crossing from right to left while those at the back ( @xmath88 ) cross from left to right .",
    "it follows that the number of syzygies which occur on any orbit segment is a continuous function of the endpoints of the segment , as long as the endpoints are not on the syzygy plane .",
    "now consider one of the two stable spirals in figure  [ fig_spirals ] .",
    "each point of the spiral determines a forward orbit segment ending , say , in some convenient cross - section near the corresponding lagrange restpoint .",
    "it follows that as we vary the point on the spiral , the total number of syzygies experienced in forward time can change only when the initial point crosses the line @xmath55 .",
    "since the spiraling is monotonic , the plane @xmath55 divides the spiral into curve segments in each of which the total number of forward syzygies is constant .",
    "moreover , points near @xmath55 immediately cross it once or have just crossed it .",
    "hence for nearby points of the spiral on opposite sides of @xmath55 , the total number of syzygies differs by one .",
    "since the number of syzygies tends to infinity as the spiral converge to the center , every sufficiently large number of forward syzygies is attained .",
    "there is a similar story for counting backward syzygies of points on the unstable spirals .",
    "consider a segment @xmath89 of @xmath90 with endpoints in @xmath91 whose interior points have exactly @xmath10 forward time syzygies .",
    "then @xmath92 is a segment of @xmath93 whose interior points have @xmath10 syzygies in backward times .",
    "these spirals intersect at a point of the line @xmath94 ( the zero velocity curve ) .",
    "this point represents one of our ejection - collision orbits having exactly @xmath95 syzygies of type @xmath1 .",
    "similarly there are @xmath96 ejection collision orbits with exactly @xmath95 syzygies .    on the other hand , for the same segment @xmath89 of @xmath90",
    "the other reflection @xmath97 is a segment of @xmath98 .",
    "these intersect at their endpoints , that is , along @xmath91 .",
    "these intersection points represent @xmath99 ejection collision orbits .",
    "one endpoint or the other has exactly @xmath10 syzygies in both forward and backward time including the initial syzygy ( if the segment lies in @xmath100 it s the endpoint with @xmath88 ; otherwise the one with @xmath87 ) .",
    "for this endpoint , the total number of forward and back ward syzygies will be exactly @xmath101 .",
    "thus any sufficiently large number of syzygies can be achieved .",
    "consider the planar three - body problem with equal masses .",
    "for each fixed angular momentum @xmath18 , we get a rotation - reduced hamiltonian system of three degrees of freedom . when the energy is further fixed at the value @xmath102 we get a flow on a 5-manifold denoted @xmath103 .",
    "if the angular momentum is zero then three separate isosceles problems appear as subsystems . for each of these we can construct ejection - collision orbits as in the last subsection .",
    "so we can realize syzygy sequences of types @xmath104 and @xmath78 for all sufficiently large @xmath10 , say @xmath105 . in this subsection",
    "we will show how to concatenate these blocks to get bi - infinite syzygy sequences of the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this requires perturbing to nonzero angular momentum and for this we need to choose an upper bound @xmath109 for @xmath110 as in the statement of theorem  [ th_2 ] .",
    "in addition we will see that nonequal masses can be handled and that every periodic sequence of this form is realized by at least one periodic orbit .",

    "the mcgehee blow - up for the planar problem has a lot in common with the blow - up for the isosceles problem .",
    "the energy manifolds @xmath111 are five - dimensional and all share the four - dimensional collision manifold @xmath33 as a common boundary .",
    "there are five central configurations which lead to a total of ten restpoints in the collision manifolds , namely five ejection restpoints @xmath112 and the corresponding collision restpoints with starred notation .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds @xmath90 and @xmath113 now have dimension three and the lagrange homothetic solutions are still transverse intersections of these . moreover ,",
    "all of their infinitely many other topologically transverse intersections viewed within the isosceles submanifolds remain topologically transverse when viewed from the larger planar energy manifolds .",
    "there are two extra dimensions to be understood in the planar problem .",
    "the cross - section @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig_spirals ] ) to the euler homothetic orbit is now four - dimensional and instead of spiraling curves we have spiraling two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that these surfaces intersect topologically transversely in @xmath68 ,    the realization of arbitrary concatenations of stutter blocks is accomplished by the methods of symbolic dynamics analogous to those used for the smale horseshoe map .",

    "the sequence itself is the _ itinerary _ of the orbit : the list of rectangles visited in order of visit .",
    "the uniqueness comes from uniform hyperbolic stretching . in the topological approach",
    "used here , we will not be able to guarantee uniqueness .",
    "the topological approach based on  windows \" was pioneered by easton @xcite and further developed and used in @xcite for the planar three - body problem .",
    "we follow the discussion and notation of @xcite , p.56 - 60 , closely . instead of the rectangles in the horseshoe map , we have four - dimensional boxes called windows homeomorphic to the product @xmath117 of two two - dimensional disks .",
    "the analogous splitting for a two - dimensional window is shown in figure  [ fig_windowpic ] . in that figure ,",
    "horizontal line segments of one window are being stretched horizontally across the next box . for our four - dimensional window @xmath118 ,",
    "the first disk represents two directions which will be stretched in forward time and will be called positive .",
    "the second disk represents two directions which will be compressed in forward time , or alternatively , stretched in backward time .",
    "these directions will be called negative .",
    "there is a splitting of the boundary of @xmath117 into two parts @xmath119 and @xmath120 , each homeomorphic to a solid torus .",
    "a positive disk has its boundary in @xmath121 and represents a generator of the relative homology group @xmath122 .",
    "such a window can be constructed near each of the transverse intersections of the surfaces @xmath64 and @xmath63 in the four - dimensional cross - section @xmath68 . in carrying out the perturbation to nonzero angular momentum later on",
    ", we will only be able to work with finitely many windows .",
    "this is where the choice of the number @xmath109 in the statement of theorem  [ th_2 ] comes in .",
    "we already have @xmath15 as lower bound on the number of syzygies which are realized by the ejection collision orbits .",
    "given any @xmath123 we can restrict attention to the finitely many topologically transverse ejection - collision orbits which realize stutter blocks size in the range @xmath124 .",
    "then our perturbation will be constructed based on this finite collection of windows .",
    "the windows are chosen so that the positive directions are aligned with the unstable manifold involved in the intersection while the negative directions are aligned with the stable manifold ( thus a positive disk crosses the stable manifold transversely in some sense and , when followed forward near the restpoint , will get stretched ; the positive boundary @xmath121 is linked with the stable manifold ) . for definiteness , consider a point of intersection of @xmath98 and @xmath125 which realizes the stutter block @xmath126 for some odd number @xmath10 . using topological transversality , one can choose a @xmath127 local coordinate system which makes these manifolds coordinate planes and then choose the window to be a product of small discs in these planes .",
    "see figure [ fig_saddlewindow ] .",
    "if the window is sufficiently small , the orbits starting there will behave qualitatively like the ejection - collision orbit at its center .",
    "they will enter a small neighborhood of @xmath128 in forward time and a small neighborhood of @xmath40 in backward time . in between they will avoid collisions , realize the stutter block @xmath78 , and stay close to the isosceles manifold for @xmath1 . setting up one such window near each of a finite number of intersection points",
    "whose corresponding solutions have @xmath10 stutters with @xmath129 $ ] , we need to show that when we perturb to small nonzero angular momentum , each of these windows is stretched across each of the others by the perturbed flow",
    ". a topological analogue of the uniform stretching in the smale horseshoe is provided by a homological definition of  correct alignment \" .",
    "the version used in @xcite differs from that in easton s work and will be described briefly now .",
    "we ca nt expect the poincar mappings of the three - body flow to carry one window exactly onto another .",
    "rather , as in the horseshoe , a window is stretched through the other and overlaps it .",
    "for this reason it is convenient to set up some larger auxiliary windows which capture the homology of the original as shown schematically in figure  [ fig_windowpic ] . to each window @xmath46",
    "we associate an auxiliary window @xmath130 with a thickened boundary set @xmath131 such that there is a retraction map @xmath132 fixing @xmath46 and inducing an isomorphism on relative homology groups @xmath133 .",
    "similarly , each window will have an associated auxiliary pair @xmath134 . then",
    "two windows @xmath135 are said to be _ correctly aligned _ if there is a flow - induced poincar map taking @xmath136 and inducing an isomorphism on the second relative homology groups .",
    "we also require the inverse poincar map to take @xmath137 and to induce an isomorphism on homology .",
    "so if two windows @xmath138 are correctly aligned there is a kind of homological stretching instead of the usual hyperbolic stretching .",
    "the next step is to show that given any bi - infinite sequence of correctly aligned windows , there is a nonempty compact set of orbits which passes through their interiors using the given poincar maps . to get the idea of the proof , recall the proof of the analogous statement for the smale horseshoe . consider any bi - infinite itinerary specifying which of the two rectangles the orbit should hit at each iteration .",
    "the set of points in the initial rectangle which map into the next one is a negative subrectangle of the initial rectangle .",
    "in fact any finite forward time itinerary is realized by such a subrectangle .",
    "similarly , any finite backward time itinerary is realized by a positive subrectangle . by intersecting these rectangles",
    "we get a nonempty compact set realizing any finite itinerary . since an intersection of nested",
    ", nonempty compact sets is nonempty and compact , we can also realize a bi - infinite itinerary . from the topological perspective",
    ", we replace the idea of negative subrectangle with  compact set \" which intersects every positive segment or better  compact set which intersects the support of every chain which is nontrivial in @xmath139 \" .    returning to our four - dimension case ,",
    "define a _ positive chain _ to be a relative singular two - chain whose homology class in @xmath140 is nonzero and similarly for _ negative chains_. using the definition of correct alignment , one can show that the set of points in the initial box which realize any given finite forward time itinerary is a compact set which intersects the support of any positive chain .",
    "similarly the points realizing a chosen finite backward itinerary form a compact set intersecting the support of every negative chain .",
    "using some algebraic topology one can show that any two such sets of this type have nonempty intersection and the proof for bi - infinite sequences is completed as for the horseshoe .    the proof that a periodic sequence is realized by",
    "at least one reduced periodic orbit is similar .",
    "here we have a composition of poincar maps giving a map @xmath141 from a subset of the initial box to itself .",
    "consider @xmath142 , that is , the set of points whose first two coordinates ( out of four ) are fixed .",
    "similarly let @xmath143 .",
    "then one can show that @xmath144 intersects the support of every positive chain and @xmath145 intersects the support of every negative chain , and it follows as above that @xmath146 , that is , there is at least one fixed point .",
    "it remains to explain how we can get each of the windows defined near our ejection - collision orbits to be correctly aligned with itself and all of the other windows when the angular momentum is nonzero and sufficiently small .",
    "we know that each window approaches one of the hyperbolic collision restpoints @xmath77 in forward time and one of the ejection restpoints @xmath39 in backward time . we need to find a way to go from a neighborhood of @xmath77 to a neighborhood of @xmath39 .",
    "it turns out that there are transverse connecting orbits @xmath147 and @xmath148 contained in the boundary flow at @xmath33 .",
    "we have already discussed the four - dimensional collision manifold at @xmath33 which serves as a boundary to the @xmath149 , fixed energy manifolds .",
    "but there is another five - dimensional flow at @xmath33 representing the limits as @xmath150 of nonzero angular momentum orbits ( @xmath151 in figure  [ fig_loop ] ) .",
    "in particular , consider the highly eccentric lagrange homographic solutions .",
    "the equilateral triangle formed by the three bodies expands and contracts to near zero . instead of colliding",
    ", the triangle quickly spins by @xmath152 and the triangle expands again . in the limits as @xmath150",
    "these solutions converge to cycles of restpoint connections .",
    "we get the lagrange homothetic orbits @xmath153 and also connections going in the other direction @xmath154 .",
    "the latter represent the limit of the spinning behavior .",
    "these new connections are also transverse and we set up another window along each of them .",
    "for @xmath149 the windows near our ejection - collision orbits approach the lagrangian restpoints and are stretched out by the hyperbolic dynamics there . similarly the new windows constructed along the connecting orbits in @xmath155 approach these same restpoints and are also stretched out .",
    "but the four - dimensional collision manifold @xmath156 stands between them within @xmath157 and prevents them from aligning under the flow .",
    "it turns out that when we perturb to nonzero angular momentum , the restpoints disappear , as does @xmath156 itself , allowing each incoming window to flow across the neighborhood of the former restpoints to meet each outgoing window .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure  [ fig_perturb ] .",
    "thus there is a chain of alignments connecting each of our ejection - collision windows with each of the others via the new window near @xmath33 .",
    "since the qualitative behavior represented by the new window is just the spinning of a small equilateral triangle , no new syzygies or collisions are introduced .",
    "\\1 . does theorem 1 hold for zero angular momentum ?",
    "this was our original question , suggested by wu - yi hsiang .",
    "solutions of theorem 2 converge to triple ejection - collision solutions when they are continued to angular momentum zero .",
    "another idea will be needed to yield such realizing solutions .",
    "how much can we increase angular momentum before our realizing classes disappear ?",
    "eventually all of them disappear for topological reasons except those realizing the  tight binary \" reduced free homotopy classes , meaning the syzygy sequences @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 repeated periodically .",
    "topologically speaking , all free homotopy classes are possible below the  euler value \" in the equal mass case .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "do realizations survive right up to this euler value ?",
    "\\3 . does near - isosceles imply isosceles ?",
    "suppose that the angular momentum is zero , the energy is negative and the masses are all equal .",
    "is there a positive @xmath161 such that any solution which spends its whole existence within @xmath161 of the isosceles submanifold must be an isosceles solution ? here  within @xmath161 \" means as measured in the shape sphere , computing the distance of the projected solution to the isosceles great circles .",
    "this question is motivated by contemplating the likely fate of the solutions described in this paper as the angular momentum tends to zero , at fixed negative energy",
    ".    * remark . *",
    "the analogous question with the collinear submanifold replacing the isosceles submanifold has the answer  no \" .",
    "the schubart collinear orbit is kam stable with respect to noncollinear perturbations . near to it",
    "we have persistent torii filled with noncollinear solutions .",
    "can we get rid of all the stutters in a solution realizing a given reduced free homotopy class ? the realizing solutions of theorem 2 have lots of stutters . for the equal mass , under the strong force assumption , and",
    "in the case of angular momentum zero , we have proved ( @xcite ) that realizing solutions have no stutters .",
    "( this no - stuttering follows from the fact that the realizers in this case are variational minimizers and variational minimizers can not have stutters . ) more generally , and less precisely , how far can periodic solutions be pushed away from triple collision , away from the hill boundary , into the  interior \" of the three - body problem ?",
    ". we can use the homotopy method to follow any realizing solution from the equal mass , strong force , angular momentum case as discussed in the previous question , changing the potential , the energy , and the angular momentum continuously along some short arc .",
    "do any of these persist all the way to the case of the newtonian potential , and in so doing connect up with the realizing solutions described here by theorem 2 ?    \\6 . which reduced free homotopy classes admit dynamically kam stable realizing solutions ? all realizing solutions obtained by theorem 2 here are unstable",
    ". we do not know many such  stable classes \" . an initial perusal yields only the class @xmath162 of the figure eight , the classes @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 as realized by planetary configurations ( depending on which is the dominant mass ) and earth - moon - sun type configurations , and the class @xmath163 realized by broucke - henon solutions",
