    "the observational identification of close binaries involving mass transfer from a late main - sequence star to a white dwarf ( cataclysmic variables or cvs ) has always been hampered by selection effects .",
    "the first wide field surveys like the palomar - green ( green et al . 1982 ) concentrated on bright ( @xmath116 mag ) blue - color objects and so found many high accretion , novalike type systems . the hamburg survey ( hagen et al .",
    "1995 ) used low resolution spectra to identify emission line objects ( targeted for quasars ) and was able to reach fainter ( @xmath117.5 mag ) objects with strong emission lines . the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) pushed to 21st-22nd magnitude in 5 filters and to about 20th mag in medium resolution spectra and so was able to identify the faintest , shortest period dwarf novae as well as extremely low accretion systems with magnetic white dwarfs ( summary in szkody et al .",
    "while this latter survey and its followup on individual objects provided a means to counter previous biases due to brightness and provide a test of population models ( gnsicke et al .",
    "2009 ) , it suffered from incompleteness and a concentration on cvs out of the galactic plane .",
    "besides photometric colors and emission lines , the other way to characterize cvs is by their variability , both long term via outbursts and high / low states in novalikes , and short term via orbital variability due to hot spots , eclipses , flickering ( a summary of general properties of cvs is contained in warner 1995 ) .",
    "this aspect is being pursued with the recent and ongoing catalina real - time transient survey , crts ( drake et al .",
    "2009a ) which uses 3 different telescopes : a 0.7 m schmidt in the catalina mountains ( css ) and a 1.5 m cassegrain on mt .",
    "lemmon ( mls ) to cover the northern skies , and a 0.5 m schmidt at siding springs ( sss ) for the south .",
    "the crts also avoids the galactic plane but accomplishes long term light curves down to about 20 - 21st mag .",
    "the candidate cvs are made public by the crts on their website .",
    "two other all sky surveys that use small wide - field cameras but only reach objects that brighten at outburst are the all sky automated survey ( asas ; pojmanski ( 1997 ) , and the mobile astronomical system of the telescope robots , master ( lipunov et al .",
    "information about the cv systems discovered in these surveys is usually dispersed via vsnet alerts .",
    "while these surveys provide the database to identify cv candidates , the confirmation and specific nature of the type of cv requires detailed followup observations using spectroscopy and orbital lightcurves .",
    "these followup data determine whether an accretion disk or the underlying stars contribute most of the light , whether the system is a high excitation novalike showing , if it contains a magnetic white dwarf ( polar ) showing cyclotron or zeeman splitting features , and if the the orbital period is long or short .",
    "this type of information for a large unbiased all sky survey allows a comparison of observed numbers of cvs in each period range and each category with expectations from population models .",
    "several groups are now accomplishing followup studies of the available candidate cvs .",

    "( 2012 ) and coppejans et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have published their photometry of 40 southern objects , thorstensen & skinner ( 2012 ; hereafter ts ) have published spectra and photometric colors of 36 northern systems and breedt et al .",
    "( 2014 ; hereafter b14 ) accomplished spectroscopic identification of 85 additional systems along with a discussion of the crts light curves . since many of the candidates were discovered during outbursts , most are relatively faint for followup at quiescence .",
    "ts and b14 compared the available results from crts to the sdss and ritter - kolb samples and concluded that the crts is biased toward large outburst amplitudes , missing objects that are not dwarf novae .",
    "however , the large number of new discoveries shows that there are still many cvs being missed .",
    "our group has continued to obtain followup photometry and spectroscopy of both the sdss sample and the crts and vsnet alerts to further the task of identifying the nature of the large number of available cv candidates .",
    "our results from 2010 - 2013 are presented here , which include photometry of 11 cvs ( 8 from sdss , one from crts and two from vsnet ) and spectroscopy of 35 ( 8 with sdss spectra , 14 from crts that have only sdss photometry , and 13 from crts , master and asas that are not in the sdss database ) .",
    "time - resolved spectra of 8 objects were obtained , with tentative fits to a sine - curve solution available for seven .",
    "our observations have six overlaps with objects studied by ts : we have spectra of 3 objects that ts have only photometric colors , while their spectral studies of the other 3 occurred during different years / outburst states . as done by the other groups , for simplicity we identify all objects by their 2000 ra and dec",
    "coordinates in tables 1 and 2 ( which allows them to be found in their respective databases ) and abbreviate these coordinates in the following text discussion .",
    "most of the photometric observations were conducted on the kpno 2.1 m telescope during 2011 may and june .",
    "the sta2 ccd was used with either a v or a bg39 filter .",
    "data were also acquired on three nights during 2013 july and october with the uw 0.76 m telescope at manastash ridge observatory using a spyder ccd with a bg40 filter .",
    "the data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "reductions were accomplished using iraf routines under @xmath2 to flat - field and bias correct the images .",
    "magnitudes of the variables and comparison stars on the same images were then measured using @xmath3 and used to construct differential light curves on each night . due to",
    "relatively long readout times and faintness of the targets , the time resolution of most of the light curves is on the order of a minute .",
    "spectroscopy was primarily accomplished during 2010 - 2013 using both the kpno 4 m telescope and the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) . at kpno",
    ", the rc - spectrograph was used with the 2048 ccd t2ka and a 1 arcsec slit .",

    "fear lamps were used to calibrate the wavelengths and flux standards were observed . at apo",
    ", the double - imaging spectrograph was generally used in high resolution mode to provide simultaneous blue and red spectral coverage with a resolution of 0.6  pixel@xmath4 for blue wavelengths of 3900 - 5000  and red wavelengths of 6000 - 7200 .",
    "on one night ( 2010 october 2 ) , the low resolution gratings were used , resulting in a resolution of 1.2from 3400 - 9500 .",

    "on one other night ( 2010",
    "september 18 ) , the double beam spectrograph on the 5 m telescope at mt .",
    "palomar provided a spectrum with a resolving power of 7700 in the blue and 10000 in the red , with wavelength coverage of 3500 - 5000  in the blue and 6200 - 6800  in the red .",
    "standards and fear and henear lamps were used for calibration . in all cases ,",
    "iraf tasks under @xmath5 and @xmath6 were used to correct the images , extract the spectra to 1-d and calibrate them . for the time - resolved spectra ,",
    "velocities of the balmer emission lines were measured with the centroid @xmath7 routine in @xmath8 and an idl program was used to find the least - squares fit to a sine - curve . a summary of the spectroscopic observations is given in table 2 and the radial - velocity fits are summarized in table 3 . a montage of the available useful spectra is shown in figure 1 . as both the kpno and apo data cover the blue region of the spectrum , figure 1 is plotted for the region that is common to all spectra .",
    "the following sections provide the photometric and spectroscopic results obtained for the 11 systems with observed light curves ( table 1 ) .",
    "this cv has a peculiar nature which has defied classification .",
    "it was classified as a dwarf nova when it was discovered ( miller 1971 ) but the light curve was peculiar in showing long periods at quiescence near 17.5 mag and also what appeared to be standstills about one magnitude below maximum light that would classify it as a z cam star ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "bruch and schimpke ( 1992 ) obtained spectra which showed the typical balmer emission lines of a cv .",
    "outbursts are relatively rare and have not been well - studied in the past . in 2011 may ,",
    "v1363 cyg underwent its first outburst since 1952 as reported by vsnet ( oshima 2011a ) .",
    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) from 8.5 - 10.5 min and amplitude of 0.05 mag were reported from may 8-june 1 . on may 30 ,",
    "a longer qpo at 28.8 min was observed ( oshima 2011b ) .",
    "our light curves in may ( figure 2 ) show the qpos , with changes in amplitude noticeable in the longer lightcurves of may 13 and 24 .",
    "this counterpart to an x - ray object in andromeda was found by master and reported by denisenko ( 2013a ) with archival images showing variability from 15 - 19th magnitude . a further alert ( denisenko 2013b ) reported unusual behavior at a mid - state between 2013 sept 16 - 25 that could be indicative of an active polar .",
    "our 2.8 hrs of photometry on 2013 oct 29 ( figure 3 ) show a double - humped modulation at a period of 109 min .",
    "the velocities measured from our 1.5 hrs of apo time - resolved spectra on 2013 oct 2 give a best fit to a sinusoid with period of 103 min and semi - amplitude of 54 km s@xmath4 ( table 3 and figure 3 ) .",
    "the lack of the high excitation line of , combined with the low semi - amplitude of the radial velocity curve argue for this object being a normal low inclination dwarf nova rather than a polar .",
    "this 19th magntitude cv was observed in order to search for possible white dwarf pulsations , as its sdss spectrum ( szkody et al . 2011 ) showed broad balmer absorption lines flanking the emission lines .",
    "this type of spectrum is typical in the 16 known accreting white dwarf pulsators .",
    "however , our 4 light curves in 2011 may did not reveal any periodic feature that could be ascribed to either pulsation or orbital motion .",
    "the sdss spectrum of this 17th magnitude object showed weak balmer emission lines and a broad hump feature near 5200   that implied an origin as a cyclotron harmonic from a magnetic white dwarf ( szkody et al .",
    "time - resolved spectra revealed a large ( @xmath9400 km s@xmath4 ) semi - amplitude variation of the h@xmath10 and h@xmath11 lines with an orbital period of 110 and 122 minutes respectively , which was consistent with a polar nature .",
    "our 3 nights of photometry in 2011 june shown in figure 4 corroborate this polar identification , but also show interesting changes during the week timespan . on june 5 , a very large ( 2 magnitude ) hump",
    "is visible .",
    "this feature is typical of an accretion pole passing through the line of sight such as occurs in the polar vv pup ( warner & nather , 1972 ; liebert et al .",
    "1978 ) , but the light increases after the passage of the pole .",
    "the next night , june 6 , shows the hump with less amplitude but longer duration , while 4 days later on june 10 , the system has transtioned to most of the time spent in the bright state .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of the light curves of the polar css071126 + 440405 ( thorne et al .",
    "2010 ) which was interpreted as sporadic mass transfer .",
    "if the increased mass transfer moves the accretion zone so that it is no longer eclipsed by the white dwarf , the light curve would not have the low segment visible on june 5 .",
    "the changes in the light curve make the determination of a photometric orbital period difficult , but the features present on june 5 and 6 are most consistent with a period near 100 min .",
    "the spectra obtained in 2011 may and june ( table 2 and figure 1 ) also reveal significant changes in accretion . on may 15 ,",
    "the system was in a low state with a featureless spectrum , while the spectra on june 9 and 10 show a flux increase by a factor of 2 as well as increased balmer line strengths over those in the sdss spectrum .",
    "if the broad hump around 4200  is a cyclotron hump , its presence together with the one at 5300  in the sdss spectrum would imply a field strength of @xmath965 mg for harmonics of 4 and 3 ( wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) .      while the sdss spectrum of this g=17.7 mag source shows strong ( szkody et al .",
    "2005 ) , the light curve obtained over 1.4 hrs on 2013 july 26 shows no prominent feature , only flickering of a few tenths magnitude .      the sdss spectrum of this 19.9 magnitude object ( szkody et al .",
    "2009 ) shows balmer absorption surrounding its emission lines .",
    "the 5 nights of photometry in 2011 may - june ( figure 5 ) show a broad feature with an amplitude near 0.08 magnitudes and a period of 75 - 78 minutes .",
    "this @xmath12 mag system also shows a prominent line in its sdss spectrum ( szkody et al .",
    "its light curve on 2 nights in 2013 july ( the longest timespan is shown in figure 6 ) shows 10% amplitude flickering as well as a possible hump but further photometry is needed to resolve if this is a periodic occurrence .",
    "this object was discovered in outburst at v=14 as asassn-13cg on 2013 aug 27 and matched with a blue sdss g=18.3 object ( stanek 2013 ) , while later vsnet posts suggested a possible am cvn object .",
    "observations by littlefield reported by kato ( 2013b ) revealed a superhump period of 1.4 hrs and shallow ( 0.1 mag ) eclipses .",
    "our light curve 2 months later ( 2013 oct 29 ) obtained near quiescence ( figure 7 ) shows some variability near 37 min with an amplitude of 0.4 mag although better s / n and a longer timespan will be needed to ascertain if this is related to the orbital period .",
    "this @xmath13 mag cv appears in dr10 of the sdssiii release .",
    "the sdss spectrum is shown in figure 8 . the deep absorption in the balmer lines , along with the broad absorption flanking",
    "the emission is indicative of a system at high inclination and with a low mass transfer rate .",
    "our followup photometry during 2011 june ( figure 9 ) confirms the high inclination by showing 2 eclipses on each night .",
    "while the eclipses are not well - resolved at our time resolution of 194 sec between exposures , the combination of the two nights yields an orbital period of 76@xmath02 minutes .",
    "an outburst of this crts cv on 2013 june 4 at 17.5 mag was reported by vsnet ( kato 2013a ) .",
    "a light curve showed a prominent single hump feature with a period of 96.9 min .",
    "our light curve 4 months later ( figure 10 ) shows a similar feature .",
    "the large amplitude ( 1.5 mag ) is indicative of a polar nature for this object .",
    "our kpno spectra obtained on 2013 sept 5 ( figure 1 ) shows a prominent line .",
    "the velocities from the 82 min time - resolved spectra were fit to a sine - curve with the period fixed at 96.9 min ( figure 10 ) .",
    "the resulting large k amplitudes near 300 km s@xmath4 ( table 3 ) are consistent with a polar .",
    "the sdss photometry obtained in 2009 october gives a fainter magnitude ( @xmath14 ) and blue colors ( u - g=0.10 , g - r=0.02 ) which are not consistent with the usual red colors of a polar .",
    "however , the system may have been in a low state at the time of the sdss observations , similar to the low state in ef eri when the white dwarf dominates the optical light ( wheatley & ramsay 1998 ) .",
    "polarimetric measurements would confirm that this object harbors a magnetic white dwarf .",
    "the css light curve of this object shows a bright measurement at 13.2 on june 15 , 2010 . the rest of the time it resides near 17.6 mag , with a large scatter indicative of orbital variability .",
    "this object exists in the sdss photometric database with blue colors ( g=17.51 , u - g=0.08 , g - r=-0.10 ) .",
    "calibrated @xmath15 images by ts provide a comparable v magnitude of 17.48 and v - r=0.13 .",
    "our kpno spectra obtained in 2010 sept ( figure 1 ) show prominent deep central absorption in the balmer emission lines indicative of a high inclination .",
    "our kpno photometry obtained 9 months later ( figure 11 ) reveals a large amplitude ( 0.3 mag ) hump feature followed by dips ( near ut times of 9 and 10.7 hr ) which hint at eclipses but the 4 min integration times do not allow resolution of this feature .",
    "a periodogram of these data gives a period of 104 minutes .",
    "using the 12 time - resolved spectra obtained over 2 hrs on 2010 sept 16 , we attempted a radial velocity solution using centroids , gaussians and the line wings of h@xmath11 .",
    "due to the complexity of the line shape and the less than ideal s / n , a good solution could not be determined .",
    "the values obtained by fixing the period at values between 100 - 120 min are listed in table 3 .",
    "the semi - amplitudes are typical for dwarf novae but improved data will be needed to pin down the period .",
    "spectra in the red can determine if the secondary is visible .",

    "while the photometric amplitude is very low , the other characteristics are typical of a a dwarf nova .",
    "it is possible that the variation caught by css was not an outburst but just a sporadic accretion event , as objects with such short orbital periods often have outburst frequencies that are tens of years .",

    "however , the 4 spectra were not enough to resolve a velocity curve and the next night , the peaks in the lines are similar in phase .",
    "the radial velocity curves from june 14 ( table 3 ) have higher amplitudes than the quiescent data ( a factor of 2 for h@xmath11 ) , implying an origin closer to the white dwarf .",
