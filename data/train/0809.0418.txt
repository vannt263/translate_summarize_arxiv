    "the imprints of general relativity ( gr ) effects on the radiation emitted in the inner regions of the accretion disc around the black hole in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and galactic black hole systems ( gbhs ) have been the subject of intense observational efforts in the recent past .",
    "the iron line spectroscopy has been so far the most used and successful technique to study gr effects and to estimate the black hole spin in both classes of objects ( see @xcite for a recent review and references therein ) .",
    "recently , continuum measurements have also been shown to be a promising technique for gbhs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray polarimetry is also a potentially very powerful technique in this respect , as shown by @xcite and doviak , karas & matt ( @xcite ) for agn . for gbhs , @xcite ; @xcite and connors , stark & piran ( @xcite ) discussed the gr effects on the polarization properties of the thermal emission of the accretion disc .",
    "they showed that a strong variation of the polarization angle and degree with energy , due to the radial dependence of the temperature , is induced . in this paper",
    "we reconsider and extend the stark and connors calculations , mainly we consider the scattering atmosphere with different optical depths .",
    "we assume the kerr metric for the gravitational field , a standard thin disc with a scattering atmosphere for the accretion flow and thomson scattering in the disc atmosphere as the origin of polarization . the resulting polarization angle and degree will be shown as functions of the energy for different inclinations of the observer , optical thickness of the atmosphere and black hole spins .",
    "the advent of a new generation of x - ray polarimeters ( @xcite ) makes the observation of the effects discussed in this paper feasible .",
    "we will discuss the observational perspectives for a bright gbhs , the well - known high inclination microquasar grs  1915 + 105 , for both a relatively small polarimetric mission like polarix ( @xcite ) and for the polarimeter aboard ixo ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume a keplerian , geometrically thin and optically thick disc around a black hole ( shakura & syunyaev @xcite ) . a full general relativity treatment is adopted ( page & thorne @xcite ) .",
    "we will show results for both a schwarzschild ( @xmath0 ) and an extreme kerr ( @xmath1 ) black hole , where @xmath2 is the dimensionless angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole . at each radius the disc is assumed to emit as a black body , modified by thomson scattering ( see below ) .",
    "the radial dependence of the temperature is given by the novikov - thorne relativistic expression to which we add the hardening factor @xmath3 correction , @xmath4^{1/4}\\ ,           \\left[\\frac{{m_{\\bullet}}}{{m_\\odot}}\\right]^{-1/2}\\,r(r , a)\\quad\\ ] ] where @xmath5^{1/4}$ ] and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of the radius and black hole spin ( see novikov & thorne @xcite for the details ) .",
    "we suppose that there is zero torque at the inner edge of the disc , which is assumed to be coincident with the innermost stable circular orbit , i.e. , @xmath8 ( for schwarzschild black hole ) and @xmath9 ( for an extreme kerr black hole ) with @xmath10 .     are shown . the results for @xmath11 do not differ much from the case @xmath12.,height=188 ]    we also assume that photons are scattered in the atmosphere of the disc and thus the observed radiation is polarized .",
    "we assume thomson scattering and no absorption in the atmosphere .",
    "the resulting polarization in the local reference frame of the disc atmosphere is computed using the monte carlo code stokes @xcite for finite optical depths ; for infinite optical depths we adopt chandrasekhar s analytical formula ( chandrasekhar @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - pda_loc ] , the polarization degree we obtain for the local disc emission is plotted versus the cosine of the emission angle , @xmath13 , and for different vertical optical thomson depths , @xmath14 , of the scattering atmosphere . for @xmath15 the polarization vector of the emission is aligned with the projected symmetry axis of the accretion disc . at higher optical depths , the direction of the polarization vector switches to a perpendicular one with respect to the symmetry axis .",
    "the intermediate case with @xmath16 has parallel polarization for @xmath17 and perpendicular polarization otherwise .",
    "the effect of hardening of the energy of photons due to scattering is modelled by a hardening factor , which increases the effective temperature ( shimura & takahara @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig - flux ] we show the multicolour black - body energy flux integrated over the whole disc as it would be measured by a distant observer . the normalization of the flux scales with the cosine of the inclination angle . for the extreme kerr black hole ,",
    "the disc can extend closer to the black hole horizon and therefore reach higher temperatures .",
    "therefore , the emission is stronger and harder in this case . here , and",
    "in all computations we assume the mass of the central black hole @xmath18 , the accretion rate @xmath19g / s and the hardening factor @xmath20 . with this choice ,",
    "the maximum temperature in the disc is 0.389 kev at the radius @xmath21 in the schwarzschild case and 1.985 kev at @xmath22 in the extreme kerr case .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     the assumption of a pure scattering atmosphere is the most critical one as far as the polarization is concerned .",
    "if the absorption opacity of the atmosphere is not negligible , the polarization degree is reduced and the polarization angle , for large optical depths , can even switch from perpendicular ( as for a pure scattering atmosphere ) to parallel to the projection of the axis on the sky ( e.g. laor , netzer & piran @xcite ; matt , fabian & ross @xcite ) .",
    "our assumption is therefore optimistic ; a more realistic calculation would need a detailed modelling of the disc atmosphere .",
    "we stress here that , whatever the absorption opacity is , in the newtonian case ( i.e. when the effects of special and general relativity are neglected ) the polarization , for symmetry reasons , must be either parallel or perpendicular to the projection of the disc axis onto the sky . the continuous variation of the polarization angle with energy ( see the next section ) is a clear signature of the gr effects .",
    "once the photons leave the atmosphere the polarization vector can be rotated due to the strong gravity of the central black hole .",
    "the emission is amplified by the transfer function ( cunningham @xcite ; doviak , karas & yaqoob @xcite ) and the energy of photons is shifted by the gravitational and doppler effects .",
    "we assume that scattering occurs in a non - expanding atmosphere , so we use the transfer function computed for the equatorial plane and we do not include the additional rotation of the polarization angle that could be caused by the bulk outflow velocity ( see beloborodov @xcite ) .    also one can expect that magnetic fields of the disc atmosphere ( silantev & gnedin @xcite ) will interfere the observed polarization . however , the energy - resolved dependency of the thermal component exhibits a rather unique profile which distinguishes the gravitational effects from other influences .",
    "as the most promising polarimeters presently designed work in x - rays above a few kev , in this paper we limit ourselves to investigate the case of a stellar mass black hole ( for agn , the thermal emission is dominant in the uv band ) .",
    "the main current application of our code is within the xspec data - fitting package , however , its applicability goes beyond that : the code can be compiled in a stand - alone mode , capable of examining polarimetrical quantities in the strong - gravity regime ( see doviak @xcite ; doviak et al .",

    "properties of radiation are described in terms of photon numbers . for a point - like source , the measured flux in the solid angle @xmath23",

    "various physical effects can influence polarization of light as it propagates towards an observer . here",
    "we examine only the influence of the gravitational field represented by the vacuum kerr space - time .",
    "the change of the polarization angle @xmath49 is defined as the angle by which a vector parallelly transported along the light geodesic rotates with respect to some chosen frame .",
    "we define it in this way because in vacuum the polarization vector is parallelly transported along the light geodesic .",
    "this angle depends on the choice of the local frame at the disc and at infinity . at the disc we consider the local frame co - moving with it with the @xmath56-axis in the direction @xmath57 in the plane defined by the normal of the disc @xmath58 and the momentum @xmath59 of the emitted photon",

    "[ fig - cpa ] .",
    "it can be seen that at large distances from the black hole this change is small .",
    "therefore the depolarizing effect of the integration over this part of the disc will be also relatively small . on the other hand , below the critical point , where the light is emitted perpendicularly to the disc ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cpa ] ) , the change of the polarization angle can acquire any value .",
    "thus the depolarizing effect of this region is large .",
    "therefore for the overall polarization measured at infinity it is important if this critical point is above or below the marginally stable orbit .",
    "it is clear that the depolarizing region is smaller for lower spin of the black hole .",
    "note also that the area of the depolarizing region is larger for lower inclinations of the observer ( the critical point moves farther away from the black hole ) .",
    "the decrease of the temperature with the disc radius implies that , the closer to the black hole the radiation is emitted , the harder it is . as a consequence ,",

    "the polarization degree and angle are basically equal to the local ones for the emission angle equal to the inclination of the observer ( compare with the fig .",
    "[ fig - pda_loc ] ) . in general , the polarization is highest for these energies because , as said above , gr effects tend to depolarize the radiation emitted from regions closer to the central black hole .    for high energies ( above 10 kev ) , the polarization degree also increases .",
    "the polarization here is influenced mainly by that region of the disc , where the transfer function is the largest and the temperature is the highest .",
    "this area is not very large and thus the span of the change of the polarization angle is small .",
    "therefore the depolarizing effect is not very large .",
    "note , however , that for the same reason ( small area ) the flux for this interval of energy is also very small ( see fig .  [ fig - flux ] ) .",
