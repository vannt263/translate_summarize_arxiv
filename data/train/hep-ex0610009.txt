    "supersymmetry ( susy ) predicts the existence of a new particle for every standard model ( sm ) particle , differing by half a unit in spin .",
    "the quantum number @xmath6-parity  @xcite , defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the baryon , lepton and spin quantum numbers , is @xmath11 for sm and @xmath12 for susy particles .",
    "often @xmath6-parity is assumed to be conserved , which leaves the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) stable .",
    "however , susy does not require @xmath6-parity conservation . if @xmath6-parity violation ( ) is allowed , the following trilinear and bilinear terms appear in the superpotential  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath9 and @xmath14 are the lepton and quark su(2 ) doublet superfields and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote the singlet fields .",
    "the indices have the following meaning : @xmath18 = family index ; @xmath19 = weak isospin index ; @xmath20 = color index .",
    "the coupling strengths are given by the yukawa coupling constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the last term , @xmath23 , mixes the lepton and the higgs superfields .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 couplings give rise to final states with multiple leptons , which provide excellent signatures at the tevatron .",
    "all analyses presented here require that only one  coupling is of significant size , since strict limits exist on the product of two couplings , i.e. from the proton lifetime  @xcite . a detailed review of  susy is given in @xcite .",
    "the data for this analysis were recorded by the d  detector between april 2002 and august 2004 at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath26  tev .",
    "the integrated luminosity corresponds to @xmath27  pb@xmath5 .",
    "a detailed description of the d  detector can be found in @xcite .",
