    "the ames research center has had a prominent role in the materialization of such purposes .",
    "a comprehensive early summary was that of borucki et al .",
    "in mid-2013 nasa announced that two out of the original four reaction wheels used in pointing the telescope on the satellite had become inoperable and the initial objectives of the mission would be compromised as a result .",
    "however , there is , by now , a large archive of photometric data inviting continued close attention and discussion .",
    "rhodes & budding ( 2014 ) , giving further background information relevant also to the present paper , tested their light - curve fitting software for _ kepler _ exoplanet transit light curves against results published by others .",
    "they concluded that there was a fair measure of agreement about published parameter values although significant differences were found in some cases .",
    "many of these differences can be associated with the transition of the photometric to inferred absolute parameters .",
    "rhodes & budding ( 2014 ) accounted for this in terms of the high sensitivity of derived mean densities to imprecisely known , but observationally obtained , surface gravities .",
    "in the case of koi 13.01 , however , it is feasible that the differences in derived inclinations * are valid and can be associated with real short term changes due to precession * ( szab et al . , 2013 ) . koi 377.01 (= kepler-9 )",
    "is similarly open to possible variations of empirical parameters associated with orbit complexities of this known multi - planet system . for koi 3.01 , the difference in the derived stellar relative radius ( @xmath0 )",
    "may again arise from orbital complexity ( bakos et al .",
    "the unusually high limb - darkening coefficient found for kepler-1 has remained with further study of the data and is an issue calling for continued attention and analysis , perhaps related to other peculiarities associated with this hot jupiter ( kipping & spiegel , 2011 ) .",
    "the fitting program winkepler , discussed in rhodes & budding ( 2014 ) , has since been upgraded and is now called winfitter .",
    "it performs optimization by a modified marquardt - levenberg application of a fitting function to a photometric data - set ( light curve ) .",
    "the fitting function is based on the _ radau model _ developed from kopal s ( 1959 )",
    "approach to the tidal and rotational distortions ( ellipticity ) , together with the radiative interactions ( reflection ) , of massive and relatively close gravitating bodies .",
    "it can be downloaded from * http://home.comcast.net/@xmath1michael.rhodes/. *    the upgrade allows the user the option of regular stellar eclipsing binary light curve analysis as well as that of exoplanet light curves such as those released by the _ kepler _",
    "mission via the mikulski archive for space telescopes ( mast ) .",
    "optimal models produced by winfitter correspond to the least value of @xmath2 , defined as @xmath3 ( bevington , 1969 ) , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the observed and calculated light levels at a particular phase .",
    "@xmath6 is an error estimate for the measured values of @xmath4 .",
    "the nasa exoplanet archive ( nea ) lists empirical values of @xmath6 for each datum , which guide the values assigned to winfitter .",
    "given such starting @xmath6s , we have retained flexibility in the values to be used in the @xmath2 calculation , however , as it became clear that there are sources of photometric variation other than the eclipsing binary effects and photon noise .",
    "the question of what can be regarded as random noise , from the point of view of systematic effects on the close eclipsing system model , is a matter we discuss further in section 2.2 .",
    "the theoretical light - level @xmath7 corresponds to the given fitting function .",
    "the central problem in the analysis of photometric data , like that discussed in the present paper , is to find the best values of the parameters of this fitting function , together with the demonstration of a formally determinate optimal set of such parameters , whilst ensuring adequacy of the underling model to account for the observed effects .",
    "location of a single optimum in the hyperspace formed by the unknown parameters and @xmath2 is effected by the simultaneous vanishing of the @xmath2 derivatives with respect to all those sought parameters .",
    "determinacy is checked by the @xmath2 hessian staying positive definite in the vicinity of this optimum .",
    "adequacy of the model entails that the value of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of degrees of freedom of the data - set , should be acceptably close to unity at the optimum .",
    "standard tabulations of the @xmath10 values at given probability levels can be used to check this .",

    "the fact of pulsational activity in this star , relating to the aforementioned asteroseismological work , could be anticipated on the basis of the arguments used in rhodes & budding ( 2014 ) concerning the level of scatter observed around the mean value of the stellar flux .",

    "( 2015 ) , whose analysis procedure allows for variation of hyperparameters .",
    "however , the main parameters connecting with photometric effects , such as the eclipse and its shape , constitute separate information to absolute parameter specification .",
    "fittings to the transit minima led to reasonably consistent indications about @xmath0 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( the radius of the star expressed as a fraction of the semi - major axis of the orbit , the ratio of planet to stellar radii , and the orbital inclination ) independently of much of the information set out in table 1 .",
    "the inclination turns out to be relatively low ( @xmath170  in table 2 ) and the star is a relatively large fraction ( @xmath10.4 , table 2 ) of the planet - star separation , so that a noticeable boundary correction ( cf .",
    "kopal , 1959 ; ch .",
    "4 ) can occur for moderate levels of distortion .",
    "this can delay the onset of the transit by a degree or two of phase from what would correspond to a circular stellar disk .",
    "the oft - cited formulae of mandel and agol ( 2002 ) , used in transit analyses such as those mentioned above , could thus render the fitting function less than adequate for precise data , regardless of the precision of available priors .",
    "our general procedure is to approach the optimal photometric parameter specification in steps .",
    "first we concentrate on the parameters that have a relatively strong effect or are highly constrained by the light curve s form .",
    "when these settle towards well - defined numbers , we allow for simultaneous improvements in weaker parameters . in preliminary fittings",
    "we would generally start by optimizing the scaling constant for the light curve s vertical axis ( unit of light ) @xmath22 , could be used to scale the representative flux from the system and thence derive a corresponding stellar magnitude .",
    "however , probably related to the wide passband of the _ kepler _ filter , the calibration in question turns out not simple , and we can see an appreciable departure from the trend of magnitudes with effective wavelength listed in table 3 of lillo - box et al ( 2014a ) in the case of the _ kepler _ magnitude .",
    "our flux - derived _ kepler _ magnitude ( 12.408 ) thus appears too faint at the flux - weighted wavelength 0.735 @xmath23 m , as judged by the run of values cited by lillo - box et al .",

    "we extracted the transit portions of the light curves corresponding to the phase range 0.05 to 0.05 .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of combining all the transit regions of all 17 light curves into a single sorted data - set of 6322 points , which has been then binned to a representative 97 points in bins of phase interval 0.001 .",

    ", we proceeded to examine the complete light curves .",
    "it can be readily expected from the preliminary information that proximity effects due to the relatively low separation of this hot jupiter should be detectable , although the system is fairly faint ( @xmath26 = 12.884 , everett et al . , 2012 ) and",
    "the scatter of the data points relatively high , as noted above . in subsequent fittings to complete light curves we experimented by concentrating all the determinability of the data to optimizing only @xmath22 and the mass - ratio , @xmath27 , the other parameters having been fixed from previous fittings .",
    "this procedure is sometimes called a photometric @xmath27-search .",
    "the essential form of the fitting function used here is as given in eqn ( 9.17 ) in budding & demircan ( 2007 ) , with further details being given in the bibliographical notes ( 9.7 ) of that book .",
    "winfitter has now multiplied the relative luminosities l@xmath28 of the original formulation by ` doppler - beaming ' factors , as explained in the paper of shporer et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "we continued with further fittings for the 17 light - curves folded over each quarter , allowing the geometric parameters to relax from previously found values .",
    "table 2 summarizes the findings of a large number of fitting experiments as performed by our team - members separately .",
    "the run of values through the tables allows an insight into the determinability of the parameters , apart from the formal errors of each fitting .",
    "the 17th data set contains only about 1/4 of typical quarters and its best - fitting values diverged somewhat from the trend of the other solutions , while the reduced @xmath2 remained relatively high . we have therefore included the results from that fitting in the tabulated mean values with a correspondingly reduced weight . at this point",

    "the inclusion of a linear correlation ( incorrectly assigned period ) improves the value of @xmath2 , but only marginally , and , in fact , @xmath8 is not significantly altered .",
    "a more noticeable reduction in @xmath8 ( 19% ) is obtained by the parabolic fit ( decreasing period ) but the decrease is from around a one in three ratio of exceeding the higher @xmath8 by pure chance , to around a one in three ratio of being less than the lower @xmath8 value randomly , and so can not be considered significant .",
    "alternatively , the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) , which is easily related to the @xmath2 variate using the formula of kass & raftery ( 1995 ) , gives a very small preference for simply keeping the adopted period with a slight change of the reference epoch .",
    "but the first 3 fittings ( reference point only , linear , and parabolic trends , have no significant difference in corresponding bic values ( 23.3 , 25.0 , 24.2 ; respectively ) , though a 4-parameter fit ( bic = 27.0 ) would not be supported , by the assessment table of kass & raftery .",
    "in fact , the implications of such a period reduction would be the highly unexpected circumstance of catching a planet within a few thousand of years before its demise .",
    "on the contrary , sato et al ( 2015 ) gave a slightly increased period value from that given by tenenbaum et al .",

    "the close binary system photometry analysis program winfitter that we have adapted and applied , however , includes a fuller description of the surface distortions due to tides and rotation , as well as the reflection effect , than has generally been used in similar studies hitherto .",
    "given the relatively large fractional size of the star in the present case the higher power terms are significant and we can expect a systematic improvement in the mass ratio ( reduced by @xmath1 40% from that determined by lillo - box et al .",
    ", 2014a ) .",
    "our derived value @xmath32 for the mass ratio is then in good agreement with that which can be inferred from the relatively high - accuracy radial velocity data of barclay et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and perhaps even more with the greater coverage and higher mean accuracy results of sato et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "it is clear from the comparison of the observed scatter in the data compared with the photon noise expectable for a @xmath33 star that there are additional short term variations , which can be associated with the non - radial pulsational spectrum also studied by lillo - box et al ( 2014a ) .",
    "in fact , the scatter in the raw data makes individual planetary transits only 1@xmath34 events : binning by a factor of @xmath1100 therefore appears desirable to allow a reasonably confident approach to parametrization . from the empirical point of view , the light curve produced in this way can be characterized by , in addition to regular eclipsing binary system effects , ( a ) an ` oconnell effect ' ( asymmetric maxima ) and ( b ) the persistence of quasi - periodic small light drops or dims .",
    "the former can be associated with the effect of orbital eccentricity , given the slight , though calculable , effects of a correspondingly varying tidal distortion of the star .",
    "the possibility of photometric effects associated with some surface maculation may be mentioned , given the cool temperature and likely structure of this star .",
    "we know , however , from the slow rotation speed derived by lillo - box et al ( 2014a ) that the planet performs around 7.6 revolutions in one rotation of the star ( unlike the synchronized arrangement usually found in close binary stars  cf .",
    "e.g.  zahn , 1977 ) .",
    "maculation seems thus unlikely to persist as coherent systematic effects in the binned light curve in general , though starspots may be partly associated with the relatively high scatter .      regarding the dims , lillo - box et al .",
    "raised possible lines of explanation involving other planets or satellites that co - rotate synchronously or are in a resonant arrangement with kepler-91b .",
    "the idea of eclipses of the planet s reflected light , although apparently modelled by barclay et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , faces at least conceptual difficulties , since the dims are more than twice as deep as the regular scale of reflected light at full phase .",
    "when this is eclipsed out at the secondary minimum the light level should not be appreciably lower than at phases just outside the primary minimum ; the star s light only being received in either case .",
    "we have to countenance also improbability going with the paired circumstances of another planet s non - coplanar orbit , though still near the line of sight , which is _ also _ at a resonant period .    given the v - shaped effect at phase @xmath160the possibility of a large trojan concentration can be considered : similarly , perhaps a hilda concentration could be associated with the extra light loss about the secondary minimum .",
    "such situations have been examined , for example by schwarz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , or in the volume edited by souchay & dvorak ( 2010 ) , but more detailed clarifying explanation is needed .",
    "it seems clear that additional systematic effects are present in the light curve that survive the repeated foldings and should therefore have some connection to the orbit .",
    "however , it is also seen that the depth of the dims is @xmath11/10 that of the transit , entailing that any planetoid concentration must involve the equivalent of at least several thousand vesta - sized objects if it is to fully account for the scale of light loss .",
    "the effect is several orders of magnitude greater than could apply to the trojan concentration in the solar system ( yoshida & nakamura , 2005 ) , and so must be regarded cautiously .",
    "lillo - box et al .",
    "( 2014a ) mentioned subtle effects associated with the _ kepler _ data - processing . a known effect associated with the relatively large pixel size of the _ kepler _ detectors",
    "is the presence of a remote algol system in the field .",
    "there would again be a paired coincidence required in such a case associated with the orbital period integral sub - multiplicity .",
    "additionally , false - positive scenarios of this kind diminish to low probability following high - resolution analysis of data from the astralux lucky - imaging camera on the 2.2 m telescope at the calar alto observatory included in the study of lillo - box et al .",
    "( 2014a ) .",
    "the more direct line of interpretation raised in the previous section is thus favoured , though the suggested pipeline error possibility can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "our treatment , introducing a low pass filter to remove these apparently systematic and orbitally resonant effects , leads to more precise eclipsing binary model defined parameters , as with the approach of barclay et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , as well as casting doubt on the precise representation of light curve asymmetry in terms of simply an elliptical orbit .",
    "nevertheless , the light curve asymmetry is maintained even after cleaning and the most direct explanation of that is in terms of a slightly eccentric orbit , even given an expectable trend towards orbit circularization ( zahn , 1977 ) , keeping in mind the great age of the system estimated by lillo - box et al .",
    "( 2014a ) .",
    "at this point , we may note the possibility of orbital eccentricity  resonant pulsational interactions , as considered , for example , in heartbeat pulsators ( as an extreme case : see e.g.  hambleton et al .",
    ", 2013 ) . physically , the argument is that an orbital eccentricity that might otherwise be frictionally eroded can be trapped at a certain value if appropriate amounts of energy are fed back into the orbit at just the right times from a suitable @xmath35-mechanism ( henrard , 1982 ; alexander , 1988 ; witte and savonije , 1997 ) .",
    "however , the potentially resonant process here is actually a beat effect , rather than a direct eigenfrequency of the underlying kappa - mechanism .",
    "even so , the amplitude envelope of selected strong eigenfunction pairs does apparently resonate at 6/p with the orbital frequency . that the suggested mechanism is , or is not , possible physically , thus invites fuller follow - up theoretical consideration .",
    "our modelling suggested the possibility of a steady decline in the period , although the likelihood of this is not high , given the uncertainties of the time of minimum determination . on the other hand",
    ", there appears some suggestion , from the results of sato et al .",
    "( 2015 ) that the period may be increasing in the short term . in a similar way ,",
    "an apparent trend to decrease of the longitude of periastron over the full range of the _ kepler _ mission surveillance can not be taken so seriously given the relatively high errors of the determination .",
    "but , in connection with such effects , budding ( 1984 ) gave a possible form for the variation of the separation @xmath36 between the components of a binary system with total mass @xmath37 and two stellar masses @xmath38 , @xmath39 , in which mass loss and transfer was taking place as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the system s angular momentum , and the small components in @xmath42 are associated with the rotational changes of the two bodies and some surrounding matter .",
    "these latter components are often neglected , at least in a preliminary assessment .    in classical algols , regarded as involved in a process of _ mass transfer _ and where @xmath38 denotes the originally more massive and mass - losing star ,",
    "this equation can be simplified to @xmath43 where we have written simply @xmath44 . in a mass loss process",
    ", @xmath45 is , by definition negative , so this equation tells us that once @xmath38 has dropped below half the system s mass , further mass loss will widen out the separation , unless there is some significant loss of system angular momentum through @xmath46 .",
    "this is usually considered small for classical algols in the process of conservative mass transfer , so the separation of the components in this phase is expected to increase . if @xmath38 were to become very small , but still engaging in mass transfer in this way eqn 2 has a small denominator , which would tend to amplify the separative effect of even a low rate of mass transfer .",
    "it is feasible that the planet kepler-91b might be losing mass in this way through the atmospheric inflation process considered by lillo - box et al .",
    "( 2014a ) .",
    "the mean density of the planet certainly seems low in comparison to more typical hot jupiters .",
    "this might then be consistent with the apparent period increase indicated by sato et al ( 2015 ) .",
    "various possibilities that might produce a noticeable variation of @xmath46 could be considered , including tidal friction and magnetic braking .",
    "the latter offers a wide range of possible parameter variation and appears able to introduce significant effects in a variety of situations . in general , of course , we should expect such frictional effects to make for a negative @xmath46 , which would entail period decrease , as suggested in figure 2 .",
    "reasonable estimates for @xmath46 due to magnetic braking were estimated by demircan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and also erdem & ztrk ( 2014 ) . however , the scale of effect that might be interpreted from figure 2 has @xmath47 , which is a 2 - 3 orders of magnitude greater than the effects considered in these papers .",
    "granted that the scale of error in fig .",
    "2 makes any present attempt at interpretation in physical terms unrealistic , still the _ possibility _ of period changes is intriguing .",
    "a magnetically driven mass loss , tending to decrease the orbital period , could be reasonably expected from this star ; while mass transfer from the inflated planet would increase the period .",
    "the combination of effects in the kepler-91 system overall thus make for interesting alternatives , and the case for continued surveillance is compelling .",

    "<S> we have applied the graphical user interfaced close binary system analysis program winfitter to an intensive study of kepler-91 using all the available photometry from the nasa exoplanet archive ( nea ) at the caltech website :    our fitting function for the tidal distortion derives from the relevant radau equation and includes terms up to the fifth power of the fractional radius . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a systematic improvement in the mass ratio estimation over that of lillo - box et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2014a ) and our derived value for the mass ratio is in close agreement with that inferred from recent high - resolution spectroscopic data .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the data analysis in terms of simply an eclipsing binary system is compromised by the presence of significant other causes of light variation , in particular non - radial pulsations . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a low - frequency filtering procedure to separate out some of this additional light variation . whilst the derived eccentricity appears then reduced </S>",
    "<S> , an eccentric effect remains in the light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we consider how this may be maintained in spite of likely frictional effects operating over a long time . </S>",
    "<S> there are also indications that could be associated with trojan or other period - resonant mass concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> suggestions of a possible secular period variation are briefly discussed . </S>"
