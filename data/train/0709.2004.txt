    "solitons are solitary - waves that emerge unscathed from collisions with each other , up to shifts in position and phase ; this behaviour is reminiscent of particle behaviour , motivating the particle - like name soliton .",
    "this distinction is an important one , although in practice the names soliton and solitary - wave are commonly interchanged .",
    "`` classic '' solitons , in this sense , are to be found in integrable nonlinear wave - equations , such as the korteweg - de vries equation , the sine - gordon equation , and the one - dimensional nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the solitons ability to re - emerge after collisions is due to the fact that their dynamics are strongly constrained by conservation laws associated with the wave - equations integrability @xcite .",
    "solitons and solitary - waves are topics of keen interest in the atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) community .",
    "this is because low - temperature bec dynamics are frequently described to a good approximation by the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , a 3d nonlinear wave equation . for regimes where the atoms are confined in the radial direction by a tight trapping potential",
    ", the 3d gpe reduces approximately to a 1d equation ( the so - called 1d gpe ) .",
    "the homogeneous 1d gpe is simply the 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation , which can be solved by the inverse scattering transform , and yields bright soliton solutions when the nonlinearity is attractive @xcite . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the interatomic scattering can be largely described through a single parameter , the @xmath0-wave scattering length . in this context",
    ", an attractive nonlinearity arises from a negative @xmath0-wave scattering length , which may be intrinsic , or which may be induced by exploiting a feshbach resonance to tune the inter - atomic interactions @xcite . as well as describing bec under tight transverse confinement",
    ", the 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation is also used to describe nonlinear optical systems @xcite .",
    "these systems provide a useful analogue of bec under tight transverse confinement , and we will frequently refer to work on nonlinear optics in this paper .    experiments involving becs composed of attractively interacting atoms have been performed in 1d geometries , resulting in the observation of single @xcite and multiple bright solitary - waves @xcite . in the experiments with multiple solitary - waves ,",
    "the bec was trapped in the axial direction by a ( relatively weak ) harmonic confining potential in addition to the radial confinement .",
    "the addition of an axial harmonic potential acts to break the integrability of the 1d gpe , meaning that we no longer have exact soliton solutions . in the experiment by strecker _",
    "@xcite , classic soliton - like behaviour ( where the solitary - waves collide and reform up to shifts in phase and position ) was not observed , but rather , trains of solitary - waves which are continuously repelled by each other .",
    "the dynamics of solitary - wave trains both in bec and nonlinear optics have been the topic of extensive modeling using a variational method @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , a toda lattice approach , @xcite , a particle model @xcite ( quite distinct to that presented in this paper ) , analysis using the inverse - scattering transform @xcite and by using a perturbation approach @xcite .",
    "these treatments model regimes where the solitary - waves are never well separated , where it has been found that the solitary - waves do not collide with each other and re - form , but interact with each other by attractive and repulsive forces , depending on their relative phase .",
    "motivated by the observation of such soliton trains , a `` soliton laser '' has been proposed @xcite .",
    "a review article on bec solitons addresses some of this work in more detail @xcite .",
    "as opposed to solitary - wave trains , we investigate whether classic soliton - like behaviour , i.e. , colliding and reforming of distinct , localized wave packets up to shifts in phase and position , is possible in the 1d gpe with a harmonic potential . in a previous work @xcite",
    "we found regimes where such behaviour is quite pronounced .",
    "this behaviour was also seen in work done in similar nonlinear optical settings @xcite . in this paper",
    "we further our investigation into soliton - like behaviour ; in particular we explore the bounds within which the solitary - waves can still be expected to behave as solitons . to this end",
    ", we use a particle model introduced in our previous work @xcite , adapted from a model developed for use in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "we show that soliton - like behaviour is possible in the 1d gpe with a harmonic potential , provided that the solitary - waves collide with large enough relative velocity such that the collisions occur during a short timescale compared with the period of the axial trapping potential . this type of behaviour has recently been experimentally observed @xcite , and provides an exciting prospect for future experiments to probe the dynamics in more detail .    in the case of three solitons",
    ", we find regimes of regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "in particular , chaotic solutions to the gpe are expected to coincide with more rapid condensate depletion than in otherwise similar regular solutions @xcite ; indeed this has been seen in theoretical studies of several systems @xcite .",
    "this provides an additional motivation to identify regimes of regular and chaotic soliton dynamics in the gpe .    in more realistic models for becs",
    ", the integrability of the nonlinear wave equation is also broken by residual 3d effects .",
    "these effects cause the soliton collisions to be inelastic ; specifically , there is particle exchange between the solitons accompanied by changes in their outgoing velocities @xcite .",
    "a reduction from 3d to non - integrable 1d equations @xcite , more sophisticated than the 1d gpe , confirms this result @xcite .",
    "this type of behaviour is common in other non - integrable schrdinger - type equations : @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates with attractive interatomic interactions are prone to collapse if the particle density becomes too high @xcite .",
    "fully 3d gpe simulations show that in - phase collisions between solitons , during which the particle density becomes large , can cause collapse of the condensate , @xcite . in this paper , as well as identifying regimes in which soliton - like behaviour can still occur despite the mild breaking of integrability by the harmonic potential , we also briefly discuss regimes where solitons are expected to survive 3d integrability breaking .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section ii we introduce the model equations and reiterate the soliton solution to the homogeneous 1d gpe ; in section iii we identify one , two and three solitary - wave solutions to the 1d gpe with a harmonic potential and introduce a particle model to test their soliton nature ; in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "in the case of an atomic bose gas , the dynamics of the system may be described , in the heisenberg picture , by the time - evolution of the bosonic field operator @xmath1 . at the temperatures typically encountered in atomic bec experiments ( nk ) , for sufficiently dilute bose gases , atomic interactions are dominated by low energy two - body collisions . in this case",

    "we expect regimes where the gpe dynamics are chaotic to coincide with rapid depletion of the condensate .",
