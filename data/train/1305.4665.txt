    "the modes @xmath11 behave as the vielbein describing the gravitational degrees of freedom with the effective metric field @xmath12 .",

    "if the fields @xmath13 are not independent , the emergent low energy action of the form of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) contains the terms that are not invariant under the diffeomorphisms .",
    "this gives the principal difficulty .",
    "however , this difficulty is avoided if eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is considered as a gauge fixed version of the action for the theory invariant under the diffeomorphisms . if @xmath14 is absent or is expressed through the emergent vielbein @xmath15 , the given construction results in the teleparallel gravity , i.e. the theory of the varying weitzenbock geometry .",
    "if @xmath14 varies independently of the vielbein , this may give the scenario of how topology leads to the emergence of riemann - cartan gravity .",
    "condensed matter example of the emergent gravity is provided by weyl syperfluid @xmath16he - a @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the construction of @xcite works for the odd dimension of space . here",
    "we demonstrate , that the similar construction works also in monolayer graphene that is the @xmath2 system ( see also @xcite ) . in the non - topological systems ,",
    "the relativistic tetrad gravity may also arise , see e.g. @xcite , but it is not universal , since is not accompanied by the emergence of spinor and vectors fields .",

    "the symmetry of the underlying microscopic system becomes instrumental .",
    "there are many examples where topology in combination with the symmetry consideration gives rise to exotic spectrum , with nonlinear touching of energy branches at fermi point ( such as quadratic , cubic , quartic , etc . touching , i.e. @xmath18 with @xmath19 @xcite ; and the mixed linear and quadratic touching @xmath20 @xcite ) .",
    "the quantum field theory ( qft ) of fermions and bosons , which emerges in the vicinity of an exotic fermi point , is certainly non - relativistic . but this is the subject of the qft with the anisotropic scaling @xmath21 , @xmath22 , which recently got attention due to the construction of the so - called hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite .",
    "the qed with anisotropic scaling emerging in such systems has been discussed in refs .",

    "this expansion does not produce the metric field , and thus can not serve as a possible microscopic source of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",

    "in topological materials the edge states are not fully autonomous : they reflect the topological properties of bulk state and their degrees of freedom are restricted ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the hoava - lifshitz gravity ( see also @xcite ) is the outcome of the momentum - space topology in the mesoscopic finite @xmath25 regime .",

    "we allow the hopping parameters to vary .",
    "in particular , this model may describe the monolayer graphene with the varying elastic deformations .",
    "we show that the varying hopping parameters for monolayer graphene give rise to the varying @xmath0 zweibein @xmath173 .",
    "the other existing field ( the 2d gauge potential @xmath174 ) is expressed through @xmath71 .",

    "interestingly , if the emergent gauge field is exactly compensated by the external electromagnetic field ( for the fermions living to one of the fermi - points ) , the effective low energy hamiltonian obeys the emergent invariance under the @xmath0 reparametrizations ( near to the given fermi - point ) .    in the case of the multilayer graphene with @xmath3 stacking we",

    "therefore , we conclude , that the effective low energy theory of multilayer graphene with the varying intralayer hopping parameters models the horava - like teleparallel gravity with anisotropic scaling .    actually , we do not exclude that independent contributions to the effective @xmath82 connection and effective @xmath1 field may appear due to a mechanism that was not taken into account here .",
