    "soft matter enjoys a rich variety of multiphase equilibria due to the subtle interplay of energetic and entropic forces acting on different length scales .",
    "when one of the parameters controlling the system thermodynamics is suddenly changed , however , the phase formation is generally hindered for kinetic reasons and one observes amorphous states with distinct physical ( as opposed to chemical ) features .",
    "such novel states of structural arrest and the glass - to - glass transition they can possibly undergo , were first predicted within schematic mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite , and have been subsequently observed in short - range attractive colloids , dense copolymer micellar solutions , and several model systems  @xcite .",
    "their characterization is not only technologically important for material design but is also a theoretical challege , as there is no obvious way to discriminate , on a macroscopic observation scale , disordered patterns that are apparently featureless from a geometric standpoint .",
    "multiple glass states of short - range attractive colloids have been generally ascribed to structural changes of the cage that confines particle motion . for weak attraction",
    "the glass formation is driven by the usual steric effects at high packing density , while for strong attraction the tight clustering of particles leads to an amorphous state with a rigid gel - like structure which can exist even at very low packing density .",
    "when the control parameters ( temperature and packing density ) are continously changed , the transition between the two glass states can be either smooth or discontinuous . in the latter case the debye - waller factor undergoes an extra jump .",
    "interestingly , it has been recently found that interparticle attraction is not an essential ingredient for the existence of multiple glasses .",
    "in fact , additional peculiar glass states do exist also in purely repulsive particle systems , such as hard spheres interacting with a square - shoulder potential  @xcite and binary mixtures with a disparate sizes of their components  @xcite . in these systems",
    "the competition between two repulsive length scales leads to distinct glasses dominated by packing properties on different length scales .",
    "moreover , in a certain range of the control parameters , the glass - glass transition line results completely disconnected from the liquid phase  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "i show that similar intriguing features generally exist in microscopic on - lattice models with facilitated dynamics . a new prediction that emerges from our calculations",
    "is that the disconnected glass - glass transition can appear in systems with either a discontinuous or a continuous liquid - glass transition .",
    "the framework naturally suggests that the latter possibility should be realized in fluid mixtures confined in a disordered porous matrix .",
    "our theoretical analysis , which is complementary to mct , confirms that these features are controlled primarily by the interplay of crowding effects on different microscopic lenght scales ( due , e.g. , to particles of dissimilar size ) , and are therefore generally expected in multicomponents systems whenever competing packing effects are important .",
    "in the past decades there has been a long lasting effort to identify valuable on - lattice models enabling a detailed analysis of the microscopic mechanism behind the glass transition .",
    "a promising approach in this direction is provided by the heterogeneous extension of bootstrap percolation and dynamic facilitation ideas  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the coarse - grained structure of a system is represented by an assembly of mesoscopic _",
    "cells_. typically , to every cell @xmath0 is assigned a binary spin variable , @xmath1 , depending on whether the local density is higher or lower than its average value . in the simplest case , no energetic interaction among cells is assumed , @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial assumption is that the temporal evolution of the system is dictated by a kinetic constraint : density fluctuations in the cell @xmath0 occur if and only if there is a certain number , say @xmath3 , of nearby low - density cells .",
    "@xmath3 is the local facilitation ( or threshold ) parameter which mimics the local cage effect and takes on values in the range @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the lattice connectivity .",
    "the facilitation probability distribution @xmath6 reflects the coexistence of different length scales in the system due to the presence of more or less mobile molecules , or of polymers with small and large gyration radius .",
    "in facilitated spin mixtures the average strength of kinetic constraints can be tuned smoothly by changing the populations of spins with different @xmath3 , and one can thus explore a variety of different situations .",
    "interesting results are obtained when the facilitated dynamics is cooperative , i.e. , when @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that is important to further distinguish the latter situation in strong , @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and moderate @xmath10 , cooperative dynamics .",
    "explicit calculations and detailed numerical simulations have shown that the basic results of schematic mct are well reproduced within this framework  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , when the dynamics is strongly cooperative , i.e. , when the fraction of spins with @xmath11 or @xmath12 is larger than that with @xmath13 , the liquid - glass transition is continuous ( and thus the incipient cluster of frozen spins is fractal ) ; while in the opposite case it is discontinuous ( with a corresponding core having a compact structure ) . in the intermediate situation",
    "there is a crossover between the two transitions that can be either smooth  @xcite or abrupt  @xcite . in the latter case",
    ", the discontinuous transition extends deep inside the glass phase , thus generating an extra glass - glass transition  @xcite . as we are going to see in the remaining part of the paper ,",
    "unusual features occur when a more subtle competition between clusters of frozen spins with different facilitations is present in the spin mixture .",
    "exploiting the analogy with heterogeneous bootstrap percolation on locally tree - like random graphs  @xcite one can see that the probability @xmath14 that a cell is , or can be brought , in the lower density state by only rearranging the state of the nearby @xmath15 cells obeys a self - consistent polynomial equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the fraction of higher density cells in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and the angular brackets , @xmath22 , represents the average over the probability distribution of kinetic constraints , @xmath6 .",
    "quite generally , one finds that at high temperature every cell can always change state , @xmath23 , while at low enough temperature there is a fraction of spins which is unable to change state , @xmath24 , and the system is therefore a glass .",
    "the detailed topology of the phase diagram at low temperature depends on the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath25 and can be rather intricate .",
    "interestingly , the self - consistent equation @xmath26 has a formal structure quite similar to that satisfied by the nonergodicity parameter in mct  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one can immediately draw the conclusion that @xmath25 exhibits the same hierarchy of bifurcations of schematic mct , provided that the facilitated dynamics selects the maximum root of @xmath27 ( as it happens with mct dynamics ) . a rigorous proof of the latter statement is still lacking and one must rely , at the moment , on numerical evidences and physical consistency arguments to support this conjecture .",
    "we recall that an @xmath28 bifurcation occurs when the maximum root of @xmath27 has a degeneracy @xmath29 and @xmath30 the taylor expansion of @xmath27 near the critical surface and eqs .",
    "( [ eq.dq ] ) , immediately implies that the scaling form of the order parameter near an @xmath28 bifurcation goes like @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the distance from the critical surface ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) .",
    "singularities of type @xmath28 can be further distinguished in _",
    "generic _ and _ degenerate _ depending on whether the order parameter , @xmath34 , changes abruptly or smoothly near the transition . to denote this latter case",
    ", we shall use the notation @xmath35 . near a degenerate singularity of type",
    "@xmath35 the order parameter behaves as @xmath36 . in the original mct literature",
    "the distinction between degenerate and generic singularities has been addressed only for the simple case @xmath37 ( where such singularities were named type - a and type - b glass transitions ) and @xmath38 .",
    "as we shall see , such a distinction seems to apply well also for the more general case of higher - order singularities with @xmath39 .    in the following ,",
    "we shall focus on ternary mixtures with facilitation distribution @xmath40 for such ternary mixtures , denoted here with @xmath41 , we shall consider two distinct situations corresponding to facilitation values which are more or less sparse .",
    "for each situation , we determine the phase diagram and compute the fraction of permanently frozen spins , @xmath34 , which represents the actual order parameter in this framework .",
    "it is directly related to @xmath14 through the general relation @xmath42 for sake of simplicity we shall consider hereafter only random graphs with fixed connectivity , i.e. bethe lattices .",

    "the mixture with @xmath50 on a bethe lattice with connectivity @xmath43 is particularly useful because one can get explicit analytic results .",
    "the fixed - point equation obeyed by @xmath14 in this case is : @xmath51 plugging @xmath23 in the fixed - point equation one get the continuous glass transition @xmath52 .",

    "this latter , in turn , enters the frozen phase thus producing an extra glass - glass transition . upon further increasing @xmath59",
