    "pulsar timing experiments by hulse and taylor @xcite led to accurate measurement of periastron time shifts in the psr1913 + 16 binary pulsar system .",
    "these matched to the predictions from the theory of general relativity for energy losses due to gravitational waves ( gw ) to better than @xmath2 accuracy .",
    "this was the first strong indirect evidence for the existence of gw . over the last decade or so ,",
    "a host of laser interferometric detectors like the two ligo detectors @xcite in usa , geo600 in germany @xcite , the tama 300 in japan @xcite and virgo in italy - france @xcite are being built to _ catch _",
    "these waves _ in flesh _ and unravel the physics of the universe encoded in them . as of present , several of these interferometers are in advanced stage of completion .",
    "the tama 300 has achieved significant observation time with more than 1000 hours of observation whereas the ligo had its first successful scientific run in august , 2002 .",
    "thus data from these detectors promise much interesting and new astronomical research over the next several years .",
    "the most well studied sources of gw important to detection are compact astrophysical objects moving at relativistic speeds , like merging blackholes , spinning neutron star systems , inspiraling neutron star binaries etc .",
    "@xcite . a gravitational wave burst with a typical gw strain of @xmath3",
    "is expected to carry @xcite about @xmath4 past the modern detectors over a duration of @xmath5 millisec .",
    "however , gw interact so weakly with matter that even this huge flux of energy ( by electromagnetic standards ) will produce only a minute measurable signal of the above order in the arm lengths of the detectors .",
    "detection of such weak signals requires special signal processing methods to extract the signature of these signals buried in the noisy output of these detectors .",
    "accurate waveform modeling of gravitational waves from the inspiral phase of compact binaries @xcite makes it possible to look for their signatures using the technique of matched filtering and are considered to be the likely sources to be detected by the first generation of detectors . in the last few minutes of their inspiral",
    ", the frequency of the emitted gw will lie in the sensitive bandwidth of these detectors .",
    "matched filtering involves cross correlating the detector output with a bank of template waveforms each having a different set of parameters .",
    "this is necessary since only the _ form _ of the expected signal is known and not its exact parameters _ a priori_. together , these templates span the whole range of parameters as determined from astrophysical considerations .",
    "this procedure is computationally less efficient if implemented in a _",
    "flat _ method which uses a very dense grid of templates to span the parameter space .",
    "the method is very well described in earlier literature - see @xcite for example .",
    "a more efficient implementation of the flat search is desirable for several reasons .",
    "eventually the interferometers will run continuously and real time analysis must be carried out in order to keep up with the data streams .",
    "this means that the time taken to analyze a data segment of duration @xmath6 seconds , must be @xmath7 seconds in real time . by the same token",
    ", the computational efficiency of real time algorithms will limit the volume of the parameter space which one can search for gw signals in interferometer data .",
    "the desirability for the improved computational efficiency promised by the hierarchical algorithm presented here is twofold : ( i ) to date , there has been little or no optimization of the implementation of parallelized matched filtering algorithms and their performance will not scale with larger numbers of processors @xcite ; ( ii ) recent developments in the methodologies to handle more massive compact binary systems and to include non aligned spin have shown the need for a greater number of templates in a higher dimensional search space than has been applied in the first searches for lighter mass systems @xcite .",
    "a faster implementation of the matched filtering procedure was proposed by mohanty and dhurandhar @xcite which could reduce the computational cost of the search algorithm by a factor of 25 to 30 without sacrificing the efficiency of the flat - search method .",
    "it essentially involved using hierarchically staged analyses on two template grids instead of one dense grid .",
    "the first layer was that of trigger stage templates which were placed more sparsely than the second stage templates .",
    "any _ crossing _ over the trigger threshold would be followed up _ locally _ by the fine bank .",
    "this trigger threshold must be carefully chosen such that not only could false alarms be kept in control , but also the detection probability of a genuine signal will be higher than a prescribed minimum ( usually @xmath8 ) . the need for further improving upon the efficiency of implementing the matched filtering method is more pressing at present than ever - mainly because of our experience with real interferometer data over the recent past .",
    "some of the benign assumptions which are used in prescribing the canonical search actually do not hold true in real time data - for example the stationarity and gaussianity of interferometer noise is a key assumption to almost all the previous work .",
    "however , drifts in the noise power spectra and _ tail _ features therein severely undermine the efficiency of the matched filtering algorithm @xcite .",
    "thus hidden costs are incurred in carrying out even a flat search where @xmath9 vetoing @xcite is now prescribed to curb high unprecedented false alarm rates .",
    "the tama data analysis team @xcite had to put such vetoing even in the trigger stage of the hierarchical search .",
    "such vetoing techniques add to the total cost of the online computational budget .",
    "an alternative implementation to the matched filtering has been proposed recently using the fast chirp transform ( fct ) method @xcite .",
    "the complexity of this algorithm is comparable to that of the conventional matched filtering technique .",
    "it may become simpler under certain circumstances if it is possible to transpose the order in which the associated 2-d fft is calculated . to date",
    ", however , this has not been explored further .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a faster implementation of the canonical hierarchical search method .",
    "because most of the power in the chirp signal is at low frequencies - the power in the signal falls off as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the frequency - one can truncate the fourier transformed data at a relatively lower frequency ( we choose 256 hz ) and nonetheless retain sufficient signal power @xmath12 @xcite . then the key idea is to sample the data at a lower rate ( 512 hz ) in the trigger stage which gives us smaller fft data sets to work upon .",
    "lowering the first stage sampling rate also leads to a changed filter placement scenario where the absence of higher frequency modes of the gw chirp causes the ambiguity function to fall off more gradually and thus individual trigger templates can cover a bigger volume of the parameter space .",
    "this also leads to further computational advantage since the number of trigger templates is reduced .",
    "however , the lowered trigger thresholds and reduced signal to noise ratio due to this method will tend to increase the false alarm rate . we discuss these issues and supplement our solution with simulation results . in an earlier paper @xcite",
    "we had outlined some of the above ideas .",
    "however , the scope of that paper did not include such complications as rotation of the parameter space , innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) frequency cutoffs etc . here",
    ", we take into account all these realistic scenarios to propose an extended hierarchical search ( ehs ) algorithm which can reduce the computational cost by a factor of @xmath13 65 over a flat search . the family of restricted",
    ", spin - less 2pn family of chirp waveforms is used for our computation .",
    "we also use the target noise power spectral density of initial 4 km ligo interferometers in our simulations @xcite .",
    "in this section , we at first gloss over the necessary background and notation in order to make the paper self contained .",
    "we then estimate the online computational cost of the flat search .",
    "this will prepare us for the ehs and comparing the cost advantages thereof .",
    "generic time domain functions @xmath14 will be denoted by @xmath15 in the fourier domain , where @xmath16 engineering and much of ligo analysis software uses the opposite sign for the exponent in ( [ eq : fftdef ] ) .",
    "we however maintain this notation for consistency with the published literature @xcite .",
    "the stationary phase approximated fourier transform @xmath15 of the spin - less , restricted second post - newtonian binary chirp is given up - to a constant factor @xmath17 by = f^-7/6 i , [ eq : htilde ] where @xmath18 is the total mass of the binary system , @xmath19 and @xmath20 being the individual masses of the stars ; @xmath21 is the ratio of the reduced mass to the total mass ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the arrival phase and the time when the frequency @xmath11 attains the fiducial value @xmath24 .",
    "the factor @xmath17 depends on the masses , @xmath24 and the distance to the binaries .",
    "the function @xmath25 describes the phase evolution of the inspiral waveform and is given by @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{eq : phase}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is important to distinguish between the nature of parameters that appear in the above _ form _ of the gw chirp . the two mass parameters @xmath27 are the dynamical parameters and determine the _ shape _ of the chirp .",
    "exclusive to this set are the ` offset ' parameters @xmath28 which determine the duration of the chirp or the end - points in the time series .",
    "the latter can be quickly estimated in the matched - filtering paradigm without having to construct template banks over them .",
    "for example , spectral correlators using ffts allows us to estimate correlations at all time lags and thus estimate @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , using the quadrature formalism to construct template banks , the initial phase can be estimated analytically .",
    "however , the dynamical parameters need to be tackled by building a grid of templates which span them . in future",
    ", our parameter - space will refer explicitly to these mass parameters unless otherwise mentioned . to ease the computation , a new set of time parameters @xmath29 that are functions of the masses is chosen in which the metric defined over the parameter space is approximately constant .",
    "they are related to @xmath30 by @xmath31 in other words , the template bank is set up over @xmath32 .",
    "the form of ( [ eq : htilde ] ) allows us to write the explicit quadrature representation of the @xmath33-th template as ( f;_i , t_a , _ a ) = ( f ; _ i , t_a ) _ a + ( f ; _ i , t_a ) _ a , [ eq : quadrature ] where , @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the normalization constant @xmath17 in ( [ eq : quadrature ] ) is fixed by demanding unit norm of both @xmath35 and @xmath36 i.e. @xmath37 , where the scalar product @xmath38 of two real functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 is defined as ( a , b ) = 2 _ f_l^f_u df  , [ eq : scalar ] where , we use the hermitian property of fourier transforms of real functions .",
    "@xmath41 is the one sided power spectral density of the noise of initial ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "further , @xmath42 is taken to be the effective spectral window for computing the scalar product .",
    "the lower frequency cut - off @xmath43 is dependent on the sensitivity of the detector to seismic vibrations and is taken to be @xmath44 , whereas the upper frequency cut - off @xmath45 is equal to half the full sampling frequency taken to be @xmath46 in this paper . in practice , the upper cut - off frequency for the signal is held back from the nyquist rate by a factor @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , for normalizing the templates , we choose an upper cut - off frequency @xmath48 which is the minimum of @xmath49 and the so called isco cut - off frequency .",
    "the latter corresponds to the last stable circular orbit at which the inspiral phase is deemed to end and is relevant only for high masses when the isco frequency is less than @xmath49 . for low masses where the isco cut - off frequency is more than @xmath49 , the loss in snr due to this band limiting is @xmath50 , which is negligible .",
    "having thus set up a template bank , the statistic @xmath51 for an output signal @xmath52 of the interferometer is the maximum of the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) over all the templates ( labeled by @xmath33 ) and the time - lags @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the statistic @xmath51 is given ) is not taken .",
    "we however , choose to take the square root to facilitate computation of detection and false alarm probabilities .",
    "see [ sec : finebank ] for a discussion .",
    "] by , = _ i , [ eq : rho ] which is then compared with a pre - determined threshold @xmath53 .",
    "any crossing above this threshold is recorded as a candidate event in flat search scenarios .",
    "let the snr be maximized by the @xmath54-th template and at the time - lag @xmath55 .",
    "the phase offset of the chirp @xmath22 can then be calculated as : _ a = ^-1 _ |i , |t_a .",
    "a detailed description of this procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath56 is spanned by a _ discrete _ grid of templates , it might so happen that a signal arriving at the interferometer has parameters that do not correspond to a grid point . in this event ,",
    "the correlation of such a signal with the nearby templates will fall below the maximum obtainable value .",
    "the degree of discretisation is governed essentially by the rule of thumb - that in the worst case , the loss in correlation shall not exceed @xmath57 of the maximum .",
    "this corresponds to a loss of event rate of roughly @xmath58 which is an agreed upon number in the community .",
    "given the range of masses which act as search limits and set the boundary of @xmath56 , a grid of templates is constructed with the above idea .",
    "the main computational cost incurred in the flat search method outlined previously is in performing the fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) and multiplying the elements .",
    "if a data segment of duration @xmath6 , sampled over @xmath59 points is parsed through a flat search , utilizing @xmath60 templates , the order of floating point operations is ~6 n _ 2(n ) .",
    "[ oper ] if these many operations are to be carried out in real time , the computational speed in floating point operations per second ( flops ) is given by = , [ cspd ] where @xmath61 is the padding length in the data segment .",
    "computationally it is advantageous to use stretches @xmath6 that are significantly longer than the duration @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the duration of the longest chirp .",
    "however , in order to preclude losing chirps that occur within @xmath63 of the ends of the longer data stretch @xmath6 , it is necessary to overlap adjacent epochs of data by this amount .",
    "thus the effective computational time available to analyze a data stretch of duration @xmath6 is @xmath64 .    for the mass range of @xmath65 ,",
    "the longest chirp signal occurs when each of the component masses is equal to @xmath66 , and is @xmath67 sec in duration .",
    "the data segments are taken to be 512 sec each ( greater than three times @xmath63 ) , so @xmath68 sec .",
    "the parameter spaces for the individual mass ranges of @xmath65 and @xmath69 in the @xmath29 coordinates are shown in fig .",
    "[ boundary ] .",
    "the mass range is set to @xmath65 in this paper and is typical for the initial detectors .",
    "the lower mass limit is chosen relatively higher , because higher masses lead to higher snr ( the snr scales as @xmath70 ) , in order to compensate for the relatively lower sensitivity expected for the initial detectors .",
    "choosing the fiducial frequency @xmath71 , the area of the parameter space is @xmath72 .",
    "if the parameter space is covered by a rectangular lattice of templates , obtained by using the largest inscribed rectangle within the contour of @xmath57 mismatch , the density of templates is @xmath73 .",
    "multiplying the density by the area gives about @xmath74 templates which are needed to cover the parameter space .",
    "one typically takes @xmath75 data trains sampled at @xmath76 which gives @xmath77 . with a padding length of @xmath78 and using eq .",
    "( [ oper ] , [ cspd ] ) , we see that the online flop rating required is @xmath79 g - flops .",
    "in addition to the cost of ffts , there are overhead costs , incurred in element by element multiplication of the data and template vectors and data preprocessing .",
    "however , we neglect them in our analysis since they are small compared to the fft costs .",
    "the above estimate however does not take into account boundary effects , where the templates can spill out of the searched parameter space because of imperfect tiling .",
    "this effect can considerably increase the number of templates .",
    "the current ligo template placement code @xcite was run for the above parameters and was found to generate almost three times as many templates as in this simple estimate .",
    "since the current code sets the fiducial frequency equal to the lower cut - off frequency , @xmath24 was set at 30 hz for the purpose of obtaining the number of templates .",
    "lowering the mass limit , increases the area of the parameter space and thus the computational cost .",
    "the results are described in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath80 ( broken line ) in @xmath81 co - ordinates with @xmath71 .",
    "note that the @xmath82 should be multiplied by @xmath83 in order to get the newtonian chirp time.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    .estimates of number of templates and online computational cost for flat search .",
    "templates are placed using the method prescribed by owen and sathyaprakash @xcite .",
    "the prescribed minimum mismatch level is set at 0.97 .",
    "the area of the parameter space is computed for the fiducial frequency of @xmath84 . the upper mass limit in all the cases",
    "is set to @xmath85 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : gain ]    using the above formulae , we are now in a position to estimate the online computational cost of the ehs .",
    "recall that for the mass range considered , the longest chirp signal occurs for the smallest component masses @xmath86 . for the lower cut - off of @xmath87",
    "hz this signal is about 95 sec .",
    "thus @xmath88 sec . in the description of the flat search we mentioned that a total of @xmath74 templates were required .",
    "furthermore , implementing the trigger stage template placement method described above , we find that a total of @xmath89 templates would be required in this stage . finally , setting @xmath90 and using ( [ eq : nc ] - [ eq : floptotal ] )",
    "we have @xmath91 m - flops .",
    "this should be compared with the cost of a flat search given in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "for the similar mass limit , we find that the ehs algorithm reduces the online computational cost requirement over a flat search by a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "the results for various choices of the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 are summarised in table [ tab : gain ] .",
    "we have investigated the performance of a new implementation of the two - step hierarchical search algorithm for detection of gravitational waves from compact inspiraling binaries where the first stage is coarsely sampled in time , while retaining the earlier flavor of hierarchy of templates over the mass parameters .",
    "the noise power spectral density used in this work is that of the initial ligo . we have described a new method of placing templates in the trigger stage of the hierarchical search .",
    "we have also clearly outlined methods to set up thresholds at the two levels based on probability arguments .",
    "the calculation of false alarm probabilities and detection probabilities in this paper follow from a basic assumption of gaussianity and wide sense stationarity of the noise in the gravitational wave detectors . also , we have assumed statistical independence of the output from the templates .",
    "however , we are aware that this may not be the case when the templates are placed closely .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations to verify the effect of statistical correlations between the templates .",
    "our simulations show that there is very little correlation between the processed output of the first stage templates .",
    "we believe that this is because of the fact that in this stage the template separations are quite large compared to earlier implementations of the hierarchical search .",
    "we also find that even when the signal parameters are far away from the template centers , there is no appreciable loss in detection probability .",
    "this result is however obtained for gaussian noise .",
    "we estimate that an optimum implementation of the ehs algorithm would reduce the required online computing power by a factor of @xmath95 over a flat search .",
    "the _ shape _ of the noise power spectral density has an important bearing in the calculation of these numbers .",
    "if most of the compact binaries are likely to have equal companion masses , templates centered on the @xmath96 line will pick them up with a higher detection probability .",
    "but this entails using greater number of first stage templates since a significant fraction of these templates would spill over into the unphysical part of the parameter space - below the @xmath96 line .",
    "we have adopted a different strategy wherein we have tried to minimize this template spillage .",
    "our simulations show that even when the signal parameters lie close to the equal mass line , there is no appreciable loss in detection probability .",
    "however , to improve the probability of detection in the scheme , templates can be centered on the bisector of the two boundary lines ( a ) @xmath97 and ( b ) @xmath98 .",
    "this strategy would increase the detection probability of the signals in the deemed parameter space without using more templates .",
    "note that by placing the tiles above the @xmath96 line , in the first stage , we are actually searching more than the mass range of @xmath99 , because the tiles span a region which correspond to actual physical values of the individual masses but outside this range .",
    "if we include this region in our parameter space , then because the rectangles efficiently tile the total space - by definition - the gain factor could rise above 100 .",
    "a search code for implementing the ehs algorithm is being written using the ligo algorithm library ( lal ) @xcite for the ligo data analysis system ( ldas ) @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that the existing lal implementation of the template bank generation is based on the quadratic approximation of @xmath100 .",
    "this is not suitable for the trigger stage of ehs which uses @xmath94 @xmath101 . at these values of @xmath94 , the quadratic approximation to the ambiguity function",
    "is no more adequate - which means that it is not feasible to use the metric formalism @xcite to place trigger stage templates in the ehs scheme .",
    "therefore , we plan to implement the approach of laying out the trigger stage templates using the algorithm described in this paper .",
    "the fine - bank templates will be layed out using the lal bank package .    for each event detected in the first layer of the hierarchy ,",
    "the _ approximate _ time of arrival @xmath23 is already determined .",
    "thus , only a smaller segment of the data at full sampling rate @xmath102 needs to be processed in the second stage .",
    "this could provide further savings in the second stage cost .",
    "however , as can be seen from table [ tab : gain ] , most of the computational cost is incurred in the trigger stage , so that the improvement in speed - up factor will be small .",
    "we have not addressed the issue of non - gaussianity in this paper .",
    "however we believe that tail features would lead to higher false alarm rates in the trigger stage - necessiating an upward revision of the @xmath103 from present values of @xmath104 .",
    "this would lead to a reduction in the computational advantage of the ehs method as more templates would be needed at this stage . but perhaps putting another sieve in between the hierarchy layers may alleviate the problem .",
