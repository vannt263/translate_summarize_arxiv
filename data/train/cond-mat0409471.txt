    "the quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd ) 2h - tase@xmath1 , 2h - tas@xmath1 and 2h - nbse@xmath1 are layered compounds where @xmath0-wave superconductivity coexists with a charge density wave ( cdw ) @xcite at low temperatures , and whose transport properties are highly anisotropic in the high temperature cdw phase @xcite .",
    "there is a vast literature reporting anomalous effects in the cdw phase , including , non - linear hall effect , anomalous impurity effects in the superconducting ( sc ) phase @xcite , stripe phases @xcite , and different regimes of commensurability @xcite .",
    "recent angle resolved photoemission experiments ( arpes ) reveal that the quasi - particles of tase@xmath1 have a marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) lifetime @xcite .",
    "this scenario becomes more exciting by the verification that some of the physical properties of tmd , such as the linear growth of the normal resistivity with temperature @xcite , and the strong anisotropy in the in - plane and out - of - plane transport are similar to the same properties in the high temperature superconductors ( htc ) .",
    "htc do not show a cdw gap but a @xmath2wave _ pseudo - gap _ coexisting with the superconducting phase .",
    "in both cases , the transport and thermodynamic properties are weakly dependent on the application of external fields in the normal / pseudo - gap phase , and strongly dependent on them in the superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the application of pressure in tmd favors the superconductivity and suppresses the cdw phase @xcite , in a close analogy with the htc phase diagram of temperature versus doping . differently from the htc , however , the tmd are very clean materials .",
    "the anomalous tmd properties are sample independent and can help to clarify the physics behind a whole class of low - dimensional superconductors .",
    "the interpretation of the experimental data in tmd is however still very controversial . within the peierls theory ,",
    "the cdw gap formation in 1d systems is usually due to nested fermi surfaces . in 2d systems ,",
    "the nesting is not perfect and some parts of the fermi surface may not be gaped .",
    "early band structure calculations @xcite indicated that the @xmath3 centered sheets ( @xmath4 ) are nested with the @xmath5 centered ones ( s@xmath6 ) by the @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) wavevectors of the triple - cdw ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the value of the cdw wave - vector , @xmath9 , measured by neutron diffraction @xcite , and recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments @xcite confirm the plausibility of a nesting scenario . an alternative theory proposed by rice and scott @xcite",
    "is based on a fermi surface independent cdw mechanism , where the cdw wavevectors connect the saddle points ( indicated in fig . 1 around @xmath10 ) of the transition metal @xmath2bands , generating a logarithmic divergence in the electronic susceptibility .",
    "however , the saddle point energy in nbse@xmath1 is too large ( @xmath11 mev ) in comparison to the cdw ordering thermal energy @xmath12 mev to allow a saddle point driven instability @xcite . in tase@xmath1 , however , arpes has observed an extended saddle band along @xmath13 .",
    "this band is nearly flat and closer to the fermi energy than the band calculations predicted @xcite .",
    "as the saddle points are not well defined in this case , it is questionable to justify the cdw wave - vector measured with neutrons by some mechanism related to special parts of the saddle bands .",
    "more experimental studies are required to elucidate this point .",
    "if on one hand these arguments seem to rule out at least a conventional saddle point mechanism , consensus on the origin of the cdw instability has not been reached .",
    "stm scans at 4.2 k in tase@xmath1 , tas@xmath1 and nbse@xmath1 show that the amplitude of the cdw gap is @xmath14 , and 34 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the ability of arpes to measure the superconducting gap @xmath15 mev @xmath16 in nbse@xmath1 , combined with the complete failure of arpes to detect traces of the cdw gap in the brillouin zone of tase@xmath1 and nbse@xmath1 @xcite were interpreted as an evidence that the fermi surface is weakly covered by the cdw .",
    "we observe that the arpes results seem to be in contradiction with the stm data , and can not explain the non - fermi liquid transport in the tase@xmath17 crystal .",
    "one possibility is that the arpes data are obscured by the strong dependence of cdw gap with the directions of the brillouin zone combined with the formation of pockets in the points of the fermi surface where @xmath18 ( @xmath19[@xmath20 @xmath21 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the arpes electronic dipole matrix elements vanish for certain states in the cdw phase due to the broken spacial inversion symmetry ( detected in neutron scattering @xcite ) forbidding the observation of some bands .",
    "the strong resemblance of the normal cdw phase resistivity of tase@xmath1 with the htc @xcite and the anomalous quasi - particle life - time , given by the inverse of the imaginary part of the electronic self - energy @xcite @xmath22 , indicates that a marginal fermi liquid theory @xcite should be developed as the basis of a minimal model unifying the cdw and superconducting phases in tase@xmath1 .",
    "the experimental verification that @xmath23 for all the tmd ( in tase@xmath1 for example , @xmath24 mev ) gives a good indication that a strong coupling cdw theory is required .",
    "one of us ( a.h.c.n . ) @xcite has recently proposed a unified picture for the cdw and sc phases where the elementary particles are dirac fermions that are created in the region where the cdw gap vanishes , leading to the generation of a nodal liquid . according to neutron diffraction studies , the inversion center of the crystal",
    "is lost in the cdw phase @xcite , allowing for the possibility of piezoelectric effects . in a system with nodal quasiparticles ,",
    "the piezoelectric coupling is a marginal coupling from the renormalization group ( rg ) point of view , while the usual electron - phonon coupling is irrelevant under the rg @xcite .",
    "based on a _ tight - binding _ description of the electronic orbitals @xcite , and on the assumption of imperfect nesting between different fermi surface sheets , the model of ref .",
    "[ ] proposes a _ _ _ _ @xmath25-wave symmetry cdw gap , with lobes along the saddle point directions , and six nodes at the points where the gap is zero ( see fig .",
    "the proposed cdw gap is odd in the brillouin zone , due to the symmetry of the electron - phonon coupling @xcite , and due to the absence of inversion symmetry in the cdw phase , changing sign in each node .",
    "the superconductivity emerges from cooper pairing between the dirac fermions mediated by acoustic phonons via a piezoelectric coupling .",
    "we propose that the fermi surface is fully gaped by the superposition of the cdw and the @xmath26wave superconducting ( sc ) order parameters .",
    "this model is able to correctly explain some of the anomalous properties of the tmd like the marginal quasi - particles life - time in tase@xmath1 , the dependence of the normal - superconducting phase transition with the lattice parameters , and the metallic behavior of the resistivity in the cdw phase @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the proposed cdw gap is similar to the brillouin zone of graphite , where the nodes represent the points where the conduction and valence @xmath27bands cross each other @xcite .",
    "in contrast to graphite , the lattice inversion symmetry is broken in the distorted phase , and the piezoelectricity can arise . as it is usually observed in insulators ,",
    "since metals screen the polarization fields , one may ask : is actually possible to find piezoelectricity in a superconductor ? to answer this question , we should consider first that in a nodal liquid the density of states ( dos ) goes to zero in the nodes , and therefore the electrons can not effectively screen electric fields .",
    "hence , one can conciliate a metallic theory ( with gapless quasi - particle excitations ) with piezoelectricity .",
    "the rigorous vanishing of the dos at the fermi surface , however , is not essential for the piezoelectricity to appear .",
    "it is sufficient to consider that the electrons of low lying momentum ( for example , in a small pocket around the nodes ) are `` slow '' enough to couple with the acoustic phonons of the polarized lattice .",
    "if the piezoelectricity and the metallic character are not mutually excluding , it remains the question of how the polarization vector affects the phase coherence of the condensate .",
    "the answer to this question can be found in the collective modes .",
    "the electromagnetic gauge invariance of the superconducting state is provided by the longitudinal response of the collective excitations , that screen the electrons through a cloud of virtual plasmons @xcite .",
    "only the plasmons respond to the longitudinal fields and give rise to screening .",
    "since the piezoelectricity involves electric fields only , it does not affect the phase coherence of the electrons . in a previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have shown by means of a semi - classical calculation that piezoelectricity is not only consistent with the stability of the condensate as it is possibly behind the quantum critical points ( qcp ) observed experimentally in the tase@xmath1 phase diagram , separating the @xmath28 commensurate phases from the stripe phase as a function of the applied pressure .",

    "ii we introduce the model hamiltonian of the cdw and superconducting phase ; in sec .",
    "iii we derive the superconducting gap equation ; sec .",
    "iv is devoted to the thermodynamics of the superconducting phase while in sec .",

    "the cdw elementary excitations around the nodes are therefore fermions which follow the two - dimensional massless dirac hamiltonian , similarly to the two - band electronic description of graphite @xcite .    the broken lattice inversion symmetry due to the cdw gap allows the piezoelectricity in the crystal .",
    "we propose that the electron - phonon coupling is piezoelectric , giving rise to a pairing of dirac fermions in the singlet state through the triple - cdw superstructure .",
    "in contrast with usual cooper pairs , whose electrons are paired across the fermi surface , these pairs are formed by electrons located in different nodes linked by a cdw wavevector * @xmath7 * ( see fig .",
    "the pairing approximation consists in assuming a condensate of pairs whose center of mass have momentum @xmath7 and zero spin .",
    "this assumption clearly _ violates _ the time - reversal symmetry of the superconductor order parameter @xmath53 . according to anderson @xcite , the strong insensitivity of the bcs superconductors to impurities is due to the tendency of electrons to be in the state of highest possible degeneracy in the condensate , implying pairing each electron with its symmetric in spin and momentum . in such case",
    ", the scattering channels promote transitions between two degenerated states , keeping the system coherent . the absence of time reversal symmetry should destroy the condensate in the presence of a very small impurity concentration @xcite . in the case",
    "tmd , however , the cdw scattering does not affect the degeneracy of the condensate as far as the dirac fermions @xmath54 living in different nodal subspaces ( indexed by the three cdw directions @xmath8 ) remain decoupled .",

    "<S> we explore the physical properties of a unified microscopic theory for the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves in two - dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides . in the case of particle - hole symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the elementary particles are dirac fermions at the nodes of the charge density wave gap . </S>",
    "<S> when particle - hole symmetry is broken electron ( hole ) pockets are formed around the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting ground state emerges from the pairing of nodal quasi - particles mediated by acoustic phonons via a piezoelectric coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate several properties in the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase , including specific heat , ultra - sound absorption , nuclear magnetic relaxation , thermal , and optical conductivities . in the case with particle - hole symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the specific heat jump at the transition deviates strongly from ordinary superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the nmr response shows an anomalous anisotropy due to the broken time - reversal symmetry of the superconducting gap , induced by the triple cdw state . </S>",
    "<S> the loss of lattice inversion symmetry in the charge density wave phase leads to anomalous coherence factors in the optical conductivity and to the appearance of an absorption edge at the optical gap energy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , optical and thermal conductivities display anomalous peaks in the infrared when particle - hole symmetry is broken . </S>"
