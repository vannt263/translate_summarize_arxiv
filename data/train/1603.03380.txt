    "in a recent paper , we studied the spectrum of a modified form of the usual schrdinger - newton system ( sn ) of gravity coupled to quantum mechanics ( sn was originally developed in  @xcite ) .",
    "now we turn to the spherical dynamics of the self - coupled gravity introduced , in this quantum mechanical setting , in  @xcite .    for the sn system",
    ", we have newtonian gravity determining the potential @xmath2 using the wave function itself to describe the mass density , so the coupled system is @xmath3 the spectrum and dynamics of this system of equations has been studied extensively , and its relevance to single - particle collapse similarly explored  see  @xcite and references therein for a review of that discussion .",
    "motivated by the special relativistic notion that energy and mass are equivalent , we modified the gravitational piece to include the self - gravity of @xmath2 itself  the resulting static theory of gravity was originally introduced by einstein in  @xcite , and has been re - developed periodically ( see  @xcite , for example ) . when we combine this new gravity model with schrdinger s equation , we get @xmath4 here , we have modified the field equation for gravity to reflect the same sort of self - consistent self - coupling that is found in full general relativity ( albeit in a scalar setting ) .",
    "the form comes from considering the combined gravity / quantum mechanical equation , from  @xcite , @xmath5 and making a gravitational field equation in  ( [ scsg ] ) that is more like the nonlinear ( einstein tensor ) left - hand side of  ( [ mrg ] ) than the linear poisson equation for gravity found in  ( [ sn ] ) .",
    "both sn and our modification take the source to be @xmath6 , and the approach can be viewed either as part of a multi - body hartree approximation , or fundamental ( the many - body view would not change the gravitational field equation here  we would still have to incorporate the energy self - coupling ) . in this work , we will take a single - particle wave - function which can not be viewed , by itself , as a hartree approximation ( due to the lack of self - interaction in the hartree approach  @xcite ) .",
    "there are other ways of extending the gravitational field equation to capture additional relativistic effects , like introducing the gravito - magnetic contribution as in  @xcite . that allows the  magnetic \" component of weak - field gravity to play a role in the sn setting .",
    "but that extension retains the linearity of the gravitational field equations themselves .",
    "we are working in a complementary direction , in which we extend to include the self - energy coupling that leads to the nonlinearity of general relativity .",
    "the dynamics of the sn system , in particular , the details of spherical collapse , have been studied , and our goal is to compare the sn collapse with the ( potential ) spherical collapse of an initial gaussian evolved using  ( [ scsg ] ) .",
    "en route to that comparison , we will first consider the role of the relativistic dirac equation with the modified gravity .",
    "then we will estimate the critical mass at which the gravitational interaction balances the spreading of a free gaussian , for both sn and the modified gravitational form . in the sn case ,",
    "this critical mass defines the boundary between collapse ( to a ground state ) and dissipation . for the self - coupled case",
    ", there is no collapse to the ground state , although at the critical mass , there is a balance between gravity and quantum mechanical dissipation .",
    "given that we are using the relativistic notion of energy and mass equivalence to motivate the use of the modified form of gravity appearing in  ( [ scsg ] ) , it is reasonable to introduce the competing relativistic effects on the quantum mechanical side .",
    "if we start with the dirac lagrangian , coupled to the lagrangian appropriate to the modified form of gravity ( that gravitational lagrangian can be found in  @xcite ) , @xmath7 then the resulting dirac equation and modified gravity coupling gives an eigenvalue problem for the ground state that looks like ( already in spherical coordinates ) : @xmath8 \\ , \\left[\\begin{array}{c } u \\\\ v \\end{array } \\right ] & = e \\",
    ", \\left[\\begin{array}{c } u \\\\ v \\end{array } \\right ] \\\\",
    "\\frac{d^2}{d r^2 } \\ , { \\left ( r \\ , \\sqrt{\\phi } \\right ) } & = \\frac{2 \\ , g \\ , m}{c^2 \\ , r } \\ , { \\left ( u^ * u + v^ * v \\right ) } \\ , \\sqrt{\\phi } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we take @xmath9 ( no orbital angular momentum ) .",
    "we can solve this coupled system just as we did in  @xcite  the numerical method does nt change significantly , although there are relativistic details that need to be addressed ( the presence of negative energy states , for example , means we need to be careful how we identify the ground state ) .",
    "we modified our method to accommodate the additional complexity , and proceeded to find the ground state energies for the new system ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the dirac ground state energy , as a function of mass , is shown in  figure  [ fig : west ] . in that figure",
    ", we also show the effect of using the dirac equation together with newtonian gravity , and the ground state energy of sn itself , all for comparison .        by",
    "how much does the ground state energy change when we use the dirac equation instead of schrdinger ?",
    "we can compare the energy estimates directly , as shown in  figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "there , the percentage difference between the energies computed using the schrdinger equation vs. the dirac equation are shown ( both cases use the modified form of gravity , of course ) .",
    "the divergence of the two energies at the masses shown is relatively mild , with a difference of @xmath10 at five planck masses .    for the temporal evolution of an initial gaussian",
    ", we ll use the schrdinger equation , where the numerical method is easy to generate and verify .",
    "we will work with large masses , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 planck mass , where the ground state energies differ by @xmath13 between schrdinger and dirac .",
    "while we are well within the relativistic regime at these masses , the difference in energy is small , and we expect the basic qualitative dynamics to hold using the schrdinger equation instead of the dirac equation .",
    "starting from  ( [ sn ] ) and  ( [ scsg ] ) , let @xmath14 , and then set @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and let @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 the planck mass .",
    "the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath21 and then we use either newtonian gravity ( top ) or the self - coupled form ( bottom ) : @xmath22 where we have set @xmath23 and @xmath24 is ( up to the factor of @xmath25 ) the planck length .    while the sn set has well - known scaling properties ( see  @xcite ) that allow a single numerical result to be relevant for a wide variety of mass and length scales , the nonlinearity introduced in the self - coupled form of gravity spoils the scaling , so that the numerical results refer only to the mass / length scales used .",
    "we know that the self - coupled scalar gravity reduces to newtonian gravity for small masses , so the results of previous work will hold at those relevant mass scales ( around @xmath26 u , for example ) .",
    "our goal is to probe the higher mass regime , in which the relativistic correction provided by the self - coupling of the gravitational field is significant , and these scales are basically forced upon us numerically  the choices in  ( [ scales ] ) uniquely render the gravitational field equation with unit coefficients .",
    "we ll start with a spherically symmetric gaussian wave function : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the variance ( up to constants ) of the initial distribution .",
    "then our initial , dimensionless @xmath29 is @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "the normalization of the wave function , in the dimensionless setting , is @xmath32    for our initial gaussians , we will take @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 . while we can make @xmath35 larger to spread out the initial distribution of mass as a source for gravity",
    ", there is no natural multiple of @xmath24 to use ",
    "one might try to extend the distribution beyond , for example , its schwarzschild radius ( at @xmath36 in these dimensionless units )  but then the mass required to achieve collapse also increases , and the initial distribution ends up inside the schwarzschild radius again  @xcite . in order to compare with potential experiments , the relevant scale is @xmath37 m ( as in  @xcite ) , but in our units , this leads to @xmath38 , inappropriately large for numerical work . at the low densities implied by taking @xmath39 m , we know that the predictions of the self - coupled form of gravity match the newtonian case . choosing @xmath34 allows us to probe the regime in which newtonian gravity must be augmented by the self - gravity of the field ( and additional , as yet unknown , physics ) .",
    "the collapse dynamics of sn have been studied in  @xcite , and all use similar methods to time - evolve initial gaussians : some variant of crank - nicolson and a solver for the gravitational poisson problem in iterative combination .",
    "our method is similar , when applied to sn , although we use verlet to find the gravitational field ( as opposed to quadrature or a pseudo - spectral method ) .",
    "verlet is easy to apply to the nonlinearity present in the self - coupled gravitational field equation , with its more complicated boundary conditions .",
    "the pieces ( crank - nicolson and verlet ) can be described separately , but then an iterative step must be involved to achieve a self - consistent solution .",
    "we start by discretizing in space and time via @xmath40 and @xmath41 for constant spacings @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we ll call the value of @xmath29 ( at location @xmath44 and time @xmath45 ) @xmath46 , and similarly @xmath47 .    the forward - euler discretization in time , for the schrdinger piece , reads @xmath48.\\ ] ] this equation holds for all grid points , and we understand that at @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 for all @xmath51 , that s the boundary condition at the origin ( for @xmath52 finite at the origin , as it should be , @xmath53 will be zero at the origin )",
    ". the spatial grid will extend to @xmath54 for integer @xmath55 , our choice of numerical infinity , and out there we ll again set @xmath56 ; the wave function should vanish .",
    "let the vector @xmath57 contain the ( unknown ) spatial values at time level @xmath51 : @xmath58 and similarly for the vector @xmath59 .",
    "then we can write the forward euler discretization ( together with the boundary conditions ) in terms of a matrix - vector multiplication : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the identity matrix , @xmath62 is defined by  ( [ fed ] ) , and we highlight its dependence on the gravitational potential .",
    "the backwards euler version of the problem is @xmath63 and then the crank - nicolson method is defined by @xmath64    for the gravitational field portion , we ll use verlet , although the details will change slightly between the two forms of gravity for reasons that will become clear as we go . for newtonian gravity , we start at  spatial infinity \" ( out at @xmath65 ) with the newtonian limiting form : @xmath66 and @xmath67  the constant term provides a constant offset ( @xmath68 when units are introduced ) that does nt effect the probability density here , but we introduce it for comparison with the modified gravity . starting at @xmath55 , we move inwards according to the verlet update : @xmath69    the procedure for modified gravity is a little different  at spatial infinity , we know that newtonian gravity , for a spherically symmetric source of mass @xmath70 , must limit to @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 if a constant offset is desired ) .",
    "but for the modified gravitational field , we have @xmath73 as the leading contribution at spatial infinity  the @xmath68 is required so that the modified solutions become newtonian in the non - relativistic limit ( see  @xcite ) , and the  mass \" @xmath74 depends on the details of the central distribution ( for example , a point mass @xmath70 at the origin and a sphere of homogeneous mass density and total mass @xmath70 , lead to different values for @xmath74 ) .",
    "since the central distribution of mass will change here , the value for @xmath74 is a function of time , a complication we d like to avoid .    instead , we ll focus on the value of the field as @xmath75 . for a sphere with homogenous mass density , the internal field @xmath76 looks like ( see  @xcite ) @xmath77 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath24 is a constant related to the mass . as @xmath75",
    ", @xmath79 goes to a constant bounded by @xmath68 , and the derivative of @xmath79 goes to zero . since we expect there to be some non - zero density near the origin , these are reasonable boundary conditions for our numerical solution , i.e.  @xmath80 a constant @xmath81 $ ] and @xmath82 , so that the numerical derivative is approximately zero .",
    "we will pick @xmath83 so that @xmath84 , its limiting value , at spatial infinity ( the best we can do here ) by shooting ",
    "i.e.  we will run forward verlet : @xmath85.\\ ] ] for different values of @xmath86 until @xmath87 , using bisection to determine @xmath83 accurately .    in both of these cases , newtonian and modified",
    ", we must iterate at each time level to achieve a self - consistent solution  notice that the left - hand side of  ( [ cn ] ) depends on @xmath88 , which we can only get once @xmath89 is known  but we ca nt _ find _ @xmath89 without @xmath90 . to break out of the recursion , we will define an iterative index @xmath91  let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be the @xmath91 iteration at time - level @xmath94 . for @xmath95 , we define @xmath96 and @xmath97 . now , at level @xmath91 , we update ( using the newtonian update for simplicity ) according to : @xmath98 where the top line defines the new value for the wave function , and the second line updates the gravitational field .",
    "we proceed with this iteration until @xmath99 where @xmath100 is given  i.e.  we continue to iterate until the wave function has stopped changing significantly .",
    "once we have achieved ( numerical ) convergence , we set @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and we re ready to move on to the next time step .",
    "the goal of this section is to establish mass values for which the behavior of the initial gaussian shifts from  mainly quantum \" , with the initial gaussian spreading out over time , to  mainly gravitational \" , with the initial gaussian becoming more localized .",
    "one simple way to estimate this mass , from  @xcite , is to take the free particle solution for the initial gaussian , which is : @xmath103 and note that the peak of @xmath104 is located at @xmath105 with no gravitational component , @xmath106 , the initial acceleration of the most - likely position depends only on @xmath70 ( and the initial variance ) . with a gravitational force in place",

    "that lack of manifest norm preservation comes from the time - dependence of the matrix operator @xmath144 appearing on the left and right sides of  ( [ cn ] ) . yet in practice , the norm is preserved well in all the runs , with the maximum difference between the numerical norm and @xmath145 ( the appropriate normalization from  ( [ normit ] ) ) on the order of @xmath146 .    for sn",

    "the collapse to the ground state , apparent for sn at masses above @xmath153 here , is absent from the self - coupled case ( at the time scales considered here  time scales which are relevant for the sn case , at least ) .    because we are using a form of gravity inspired by special relativistic mass - energy equivalence , we first calculated the energy spectrum of the quantum - mechanical / self - coupled gravitational system using the dirac equation , to compare with the previously published schrdinger spectrum , and found that , for the masses of interest to us at collapse , the error in the ground state energy is @xmath0 , this suggests we can use the schrdinger equation to evolve the initial gaussian forward in time without incurring too much error . for comparison ,",
    "the difference between the ground state energy for sn and dirac with self - coupled gravity is @xmath174 .",
    "self - coupled gravity does not appear to collapse to its ground state ( or any other ) ; the wave function does not achieve a relatively static steady state , as it does in sn , nor does it  converge \" ( in overlap ) to its ground state .",
    "it would be interesting to establish , analytically , that the ground state in the self - coupled form of gravity is dynamically unstable , leading to the observed oscillation without the decay to the ground state present in sn .",
    "another potential issue is our use of the schrdinger equation  perhaps at higher mass values , where the dirac equation is relevant , we would find a damped - oscillatory collapse for the self - coupled gravity .",

    "<S> we show that the schrdinger ground state energies match the dirac ones with an error of @xmath0 . at the planck mass scale </S>",
    "<S> , we predict the critical mass at which a potential collapse could occur for the self - coupled gravitational case , @xmath1 planck mass , and show that gravitational attraction opposes gaussian spreading at around this value , which is a factor of two higher than the one predicted ( and verified ) for the schrdinger - newton system . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the schrdinger - newton dynamics , we do not find that the self - coupled case tends to decay towards its ground state ; there is no collapse in this case . </S>"
