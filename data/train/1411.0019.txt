    "physical properties of quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) superconductors have been intensively studied since the discovery of superconductivity in the bechgaard salts - superconductors in the chemical family ( tmtsf)@xmath4x , where x= clo@xmath5 , pf@xmath1 , etc [ 1,2 ] .",
    "early experiments alluded to the unconventional nature of these superconductors , as non - magnetic impurities destroyed superconductivity [ 3,4 ] and the so - called hebel - slichter peak in the nmr data was not observed [ 5 ] .",
    "recent experiments [ 6 ] have firmly supported these early findings . despite 30 years of intensive investigations ,",
    "the nature of superconductivity in the bechgaard salts is still controversial . on the one hand",
    "it was shown [ 7 - 9 ] that superconducting phase in ( tmtsf)@xmath4clo@xmath5 compound is more likely of d - wave type with zeros on q1d fermi surface .",
    "on the other hand , in ( tmtsf)@xmath4pf@xmath1 compound there is still some chance of a spin triplet superconducting pairing [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "triplet superconductors with layered q1d fermi surfaces ( fs ) were theoretically shown to exhibit very unusual magnetic properties in a high magnetic field perpendicular to the chains and parallel to the layers .",
    "more precisely , it was demonstrated [ 13 - 16 ] that superconductivity can be restored as a pure two - dimensional phase when the magnetic field is high enough to localize conducting electrons on q2d layers .",
    "this happens when the typical `` sizes '' of electron trajectories become less than the inter - plane distance due to the so - called quantum @xmath6 dimensional crossover [ 2 ] .",
    "( note that this phenomenon , which we call reentrant superconductivity , was first suggested in ref.[13 ] and is different from the quantum limit ( ql ) superconductivity , suggested for a pure 3d case by tesanovic and razolt [ 17 ] and for a q1d case by us [ 18 ] . )    in this context , the possible triplet superconductor li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 presents unique opportunity to study superconductivity in high magnetic fields .",
    "li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 is a q1d , layered transition metal oxide , structurally similar to the bechgaard salts .",
    "it is metallic at high temperatures and undergoes a superconducting transition at @xmath7 .",
    "recently , mercure et al . [ 19 ] have shown that superconductivity in the li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 compound exceeds the so - called clogston - chandrasekhar paramagnetic limit [ 20 ] by 5 times .",
    "our theoretical analysis [ 21,22 ] of the experimental curves in ref .",
    "[ 19 ] showed excellent quantitative agreement between the experimental properties and the theoretical predictions for a spin - triplet superconductor in the absence of pauli destructive effects .",

    "we note that the possibility of existence of reentrant superconductivity phenomenon is restricted by such triplet phases where the spin - splitting pauli effects against superconductivity are absent .",

    "the latter shows that a nodeless scenario of triplet superconductivity parametrized by an order parameter that changes its sign on the two sheets of the q1d fermi surface leads to the experimentally observed destruction of superconductivity by pure orbital effects in a magnetic field parallel to conducting chains .",

    "our calculations show that such fields , parallel to the layers and perpendicular to the conducting chains lead to the appearance of the reentrant superconductivity phenomenon in li@xmath0mo@xmath1o@xmath2 below a reentrant transition temperature of @xmath9k .",
    "second , we calculate the angular dependence of @xmath10 to account for inclination of the same magnetic field from the optimal geometry of the corresponding experiment",
    ". the latter will allow to conduct the experiments with necessary accuracy .",

    "for our present theoretical analysis of the reentrant phase , we initially consider a q1d conductor in a magnetic field parallel to the layers and perpendicular to the conducting chains , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the q1d fermi surface , shown in fig.2 , consists of two open , slightly warped sheets centered at @xmath11 .",
