    "currently there is much interest in plasmon excitations and their effects on the properties of the object ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "plasmons are the collective excitation of electrons . they are found in strongly correlated systems such as nanotubes , fullerenes ( not limited to the carbon variety ) and metallic clusters . the endohedral atom , an atom confined within a fullerene , is another area of interest @xcite and particularly metallofullerenes @xcite .",
    "other forms of confinement include confinement as dopant in metals @xcite and confinement within hollow structures such as nanotubes and inorganic fullerenes .",
    "connerade and solovyov studied the effect of electromagnetic screening on an atom confined within a fullerene @xcite .",
    "an atom inside the spherical @xmath0 molecule was considered .",
    "they found that the screening is strongly dependent on the frequency , hence the term dynamical screening .",
    "near the plasmon frequency of the fullerene there is a large amplification of the field within the fullerene , leading to an enhancement of the photoabsorption cross section of the endohedral atom . in their work",
    "they treated the fullerene as an infinitely thin spherical shell .",
    "connerade and solovyov used the hydrodynamic formalism outlined in @xcite .",
    "recent work by scully @xcite and by reinkster @xcite demonstrate the existence of a second giant resonance in the single photoionisation cross section of multiply ionised @xmath0 molecules .",
    "the first resonance is known to correspond to the surface plasmon of the fullerene .",
    "the nature of the second resonance has been discussed by scully in the original paper and also by korol and solovyov in the comment @xcite .",
    "this is an investigation into the effects of a fullerene that has finite width , and in particular , focusses on the dynamical screening factor studied in @xcite .",
    "consider a system where an atom is confined at the centre of a spherical fullerene .",
    "this fullerene has an average radius of @xmath1 and a thickness of @xmath2 as depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "when this system is exposed to an electromagnetic field , the presence of the fullerene dynamically screens the confined atom - it experiences a field that is either enhanced or suppressed depending on the field frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the result is that , for the same external field , the photoabsorption rate of the confined atom differs from that of the free atom .",
    "a dynamical screening factor @xmath4 may be defined to relate the photoabsorption cross sectons of these two atoms :    @xmath5     and thickness @xmath2 .",
    "the inner and the outer radii of the fullerene are given by @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "this system is exposed to an external field @xmath8 . ]    in this work the problem has been studied using a dielectric shell model , first applied to fullerenes by lambin @xcite to study the two surface plasmon modes .",
    "the fullerene is modelled as a spherical shell of dielectric function @xmath9 .",
    "it has an inner and an outer radius of @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , with @xmath1 being their average .",
    "the atom , located at @xmath10 is characterised by the polarizability @xmath11 and the average radius @xmath12 , which is assumed to be small in comparison to @xmath13 .",
    "this system is exposed to a monochromatic electromagnetic wave . using the dipole approximation and neglecting the magnetic part ,",
    "this is treated as an external uniform electric field @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed that the quantities discussed here depend on the frequency @xmath3 of the external field , i.e. all the relations are written for the fourier components of the corresponding quantities . to calculate the screening factor @xmath15",
    ", one must find the absorption rate of the confined atom and compare it with that of the free atom . in the dipole limit ,",
    "an object exposed to an electromagnetic wave will absorb its energy with a rate q given by @xcite    @xmath16    here the integration is carried out over the volume of the considered system .",
    "@xmath17 is the electric field intensity at the position @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the dipole moment of the integration element at that position .",
    "thus to calculate @xmath20 , the atom s photoabsorption rate , it is necessary to obtain a precise expression for the field experienced by the confined atom .      when the system is exposed to the external electric field , both the fullerene and the atom become polarized .",
    "the field , which acts on the atom may be decomposed into the contributions described by the following .",
    "the external field polarizes the dielectric shell , creating an additional field .",
    "both fields polarize the confined atom , giving rise to a third field .",
    "this third field causes further polarization of the shell , which further polarizes the atom etc . to obtain a precise expression for the field experienced by the confined atom",
    ", one must consider this infinite cycle of the shell ( and of the atom ) being polarized and polarizing .",
    "this was achieved by splitting the problem up into two parts : the dielectric shell in the external field ( section [ sec : prob1 ] ) , and a point - like dipole at the centre of the shell in the absence of the external field ( section [ sec : prob2 ] ) .",
    "results from these two problems were then combined in an iterative manner to construct the final expression for the total field @xmath21 inside the fullerene ( section [ sec : prob3 ] ) .      the problem of a solid dielectric sphere in a uniform field is well known and discussed in many textbooks , @xcite .",
    "the case of a dielectric shell in a uniform field is an extension of that problem to a spherical layer @xcite . using the method detailed in @xcite",
    ", one finds the electric field to be :    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    and @xmath25 , the ratio of the inner to outer shell radii , given by    @xmath26      when a field @xmath27 polarizes the atom , with polarizability @xmath11 , the induced dipole moment @xmath28 is given by :    @xmath29    consider the general problem of a point - like dipole @xmath28 located at the centre of the dielectric shell in the absence of an external field .",
    "the dipole moment polarizes the shell .",
    "both fields contribute to the total field intensity over the whole space . applying the same approach as in section [ sec : prob1 ] ,",
    "one finds the following expression for the electric field :    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    with @xmath32 defined as in ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the problem of the atom confined at the centre of the dielectric shell in the presence of the external field @xmath33 . to construct the precise expression for the field we combine the results from the previous sections in an iterative manner described below .",
    "let @xmath34 refer to the electric field at @xmath10 due to the polarization of the shell and @xmath35 refer to the induced moment of the atom in the @xmath36 iteration .",
    "then the iteration scheme is as follows .    _",
    "@xmath37 iteration : _ the external field @xmath33 induces a dipole moment in the shell , which creates the additional field @xmath38 . the combined field @xmath39 , refer to ( [ eq : field1 ] ) , polarizes the atom and induces the dipole moment @xmath40 .    _",
    "@xmath41 iteration : _ as discussed in section [ sec : prob2 ] , the dipole @xmath42 gives rise to another induced dipole moment of the shell .",
    "this creates the additional field @xmath43 at @xmath10 , refer to ( [ eq : field2 ] ) : @xmath44    this field in turn induces the dipole moment @xmath45 given by :    @xmath46    _ @xmath36 iteration : _ it follows that for the iterations where @xmath47 , the relations for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by :    @xmath48    the above relations are then expressed in terms of @xmath33 and then summed over all iterations to give the total field due to the polarization of the system and the total dipole moment @xmath49 of the atom .",
    "the total electrical field at the atom @xmath21 , is simply the polarization field combined with the external field .",
    "@xmath50    where    @xmath51    the field at @xmath10 , given by @xmath21 , has been modified by the system .",
    "equation ( [ eq : finalfield ] ) shows that the electric field , which the atom is exposed to , differs from the external field by a factor of @xmath52 , which depends on the frequency of the external field .",
    "the absorption rate of the electromagnetic wave by the system may be divided into two parts : absorption due to the two surfaces of the fullerene shell and due to the atom . from ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : finalfield ] ) , the atom s absorption rate is :    @xmath53    the difference between this absorption rate for the confined atom and that of the free atom is the factor of @xmath54 , and from ( [ eq : definition ] ) , this factor is the dynamical screening factor @xmath55 .    in the approximation",
    "that the radius of the atom , @xmath12 is much smaller than that of the fullerene the expression for @xmath56 may be simplified .",
    "the polarizability of the atom , @xmath57 , is roughly proportional to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath59 is therefore negligible and ( [ eq : fexact ] ) becomes @xmath60 .",
    "thus the screening factor is :    @xmath61    further analysis of @xmath56 requires the dielectric function of the shell to be expressed in terms of the angular frequency of the electric field , @xmath3 .",
    "this depends on the material nature of the fullerene .",
    "it must be emphasised that until this point the expression for the screening factor is independent of the ` type of material ' of the shell .",
    "henceforth the fullerene shall be treated as being metallic on account of the delocalization of the valence electrons . following the drude model @xcite and temporarily ignoring the damping of the plasmon oscillations ,",
    "the dielectric function @xmath9 is expressed as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the volume plasmon frequency , which is described by the total number of delocalised electrons @xmath64 ( 4 valence electrons from each carbon atom ) and the volume of the shell @xmath65 :    @xmath66    it can be shown that @xmath32 , see ( [ eq : delta ] ) , is transformed by the drude model into :    @xmath67    where    @xmath68    the frequencies @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the eigenfrequencies of the surface plasmon modes of the fullerene @xcite : the plasmons at the inner and the outer surfaces of the fullerene are coupled oscillators and has two normal modes . in the symmetric mode characterised by @xmath69 the charge densities of the two surfaces oscillate in phase , whereas in the antisymmetric mode of frequency @xmath70 they are in antiphase .    the screening factor ( [ eq : cf ] ) can be expressed as a sum of terms resonant in @xmath69 and in @xmath70 :    @xmath71    in the expression above damping has been introduced via the widths of the symmetric and antisymmetric plasmon mode , @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "they describe the decay rate from collective excitation to the incoherent sum of single - electron excitations . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to calculate these widths .",
    "various methods for calculating the widths are described in @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of calculation , the widths of the two plasmons were set as a fraction of the corresponding resonant frequency : @xmath74 .",
    "the values of @xmath75 used here are 0.1 , 0.25 and 0.5 .",
    "it should be noted that the screening factor is now completely parameterised by the the number of delocalised electrons , the outer radii and the quantity @xmath25 , the ratio of the fullerene s inner and outer radii .    .",

    "it must be noted that @xmath69 for @xmath0 is experimentally known to be 20 ev @xcite .",

    "all the plots of the screening factor show that in the static limit the atom is completely shielded from the external field . at every high frequencies the fullerene is transparent to the light and there is no enhancement .",
    "this is as expected for a metallic fullerene .",
    "the profile of the screening factor for the different fullerenes are very similar and show a strong dependence on the value of @xmath75 .",
    "there is a peak in the vicinity of the first resonant frequency and another feature near the second resonant frequency due to the symmetric and the antisymmetric plasmon modes , respectively , as demonstrated in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "their characteristics are determined by the damping of the plasmons , which are determined by the value of @xmath75 . for each fullerene",
    ", there is a well defined peak at each resonant frequency for @xmath80 . for larger values of @xmath75 , the individual contribution of the second plasmon mode",
    "is strongly suppressed by the damping . here",
    "the interference terms of the screening factor become more significant and the second resonance is reduced to an extension of the first peak , as shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",

    "the individual contributions of the symmetric and the antisymmetric plasmon modes are also shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from figure [ fig:2 ] it can be seen that the relative heights of the first peaks are almost the same for the different fullerenes . in this region",
    "the contribution from the second plasmon mode is effectively constant and is small . using the approximation that the maximum occurs at the first resonant frequency , one arrives at this result :",
    "@xmath82    where @xmath83 is a function of @xmath25 , which is fixed by the particular fullerene .",
    "this relation explains the large differences in @xmath84 , seen in figure [ fig:2 ] , for the different values of @xmath75 and also between the different fullerenes .      in the limit of the infinitely thin fullerene of radius @xmath1 ,",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath86 .",
    "following on from this , one shows that the two resonant frequencies become    @xmath87    physically , the two surfaces approach each other . at the limit ,",
    "the two surfaces merge and only the symmetric mode is possible .",
    "here , @xmath88 , removing the second resonant term , and @xmath69 becomes @xmath89 , the resonant frequency for the surface plasmon of the infinitely thin fullerene .",
    "thus the screening factor becomes :    @xmath90    this is the result given by connerade and solovyov in @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the two screening factors is given in figure [ fig:4 ] .",

    "recent studies @xcite have demonstrated the existence of a second plasmon peak in the photoabsorption cross section of the fullerene .     with @xmath81 . ]",
    "in this paper we have generalised the dynamical screening factor obtained by connerade and solovyov @xcite for an atom confined within an infinitely thin fullerene to that of an atom confined by a fullerene of finite width .",
    "we have taken a classical dielectrical approach to study the screening of an atom at the centre of the fullerene .",
    "we have focussed on the case where the polarisability of the confined atom is sufficiently small so as to not have an appreciable effect on the field inside the fullerene .    with this classical approach",
    "we give a qualitative description of the dynamical screening factor .",
    "we have shown that there are two surface plasmon eigenomdes of this thick fullerene .",
    "they result in two frequency ranges where there are large enhancements of the confined atom s photoabsorption cross section .",
    "this is in contrast to the single frequency range for the infinitely thin fullerene . for cases of minor",
    "damping of the plasmons , there are two distinct peaks of the screening factor in the vicinity of the plasmon resonant frequencies .",
    "when damping is large , the second peak is suppressed and becomes an extension of the first peak .    despite the simplicity of this model",
