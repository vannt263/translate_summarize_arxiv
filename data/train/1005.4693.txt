    "over the last decade , astronomers have carefully scrutinized the large fraction of molecular cloud dense cores that contain no point sources of radiation , in order to understand more fully the onset of star formation .",
    "it was already established that the gross properties of these objects differ little from their counterparts with internal stars @xcite , except perhaps for a mass that is slightly higher on average ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  3 ) .",
    "more detailed spectroscopic studies of molecular line emission revealed that many starless cores exhibit signs of inward contraction @xcite .",
    "the hallmark of this so - called infall signature is an asymmetric emission line , often with a self - absorption dip , that is skewed to the blue .",
    "there is a variety of line profiles seen in dense cores , sometimes even in the same object , and the profile just described is by no means universal .",
    "it is preferentially found in starless cores with a higher central column density and optical depth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". such cores also exhibit chemical abundances that differentiate them from lower - density objects @xcite .",
    "the kinematic signature is especially common in more evolved dense cores that contain class  0 and class  i sources , i.e. , very young , embedded stars @xcite .",
    "these facts , together with the simple and compelling infall interpretation of the asymmetric profiles @xcite , have convinced most researchers that we are witnessing a type of contraction that precedes the free - fall collapse onto a protostar .",
    "the contraction hypothesis is especially convincing for starless cores , where there is no possibility of confusion from stellar outflows .    what is the physical cause of this motion ?",
    "the observed magnitude of the infall velocity is typically a few tenths of the sound speed .",
    "this finding rules out ambipolar diffusion as the underlying process , since the characteristic ion - neutral drift speed is much smaller ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "conversely , the subsonic level of the velocity , together with the statistical prevalence of starless cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicate that such objects are relatively long - lived @xcite , and thus are unlikely to be in a true state of collapse , as proposed by @xcite .    in a recent contribution (",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) we introduced a new model for the contraction .",
    "starless cores , like all self - gravitating objects , undergo bulk oscillations .",
    "indeed , there are now several cases where spectroscopic observations indicate that such oscillations are occurring @xcite . for an object that has evolved to the point of collapse , by whatever means",
    ", the frequency of the lowest normal mode vanishes .",
    "we studied , using perturbation theory , how a cloud subject to such a frozen ( more commonly called ` neutral ' ) mode slowly evolves toward full - blown collapse .",
    "we found that this previously unrecognized phase of quasi - static contraction lasts a considerable period ( of order @xmath3  yr ) , during which time the cloud attains internal speeds similar to those observed ( see fig .",
    "4 of paper  i ) .    encouraged by this result , we now seek to forge a stronger link to the observations .",
    "we calculate , using a publicly available radiative transfer code , the emitted line spectrum from our model cloud .",
    "we choose three molecules that are among the most commonly employed in the spectroscopic studies : n@xmath0h@xmath1 , cs , and hcn . following the early surveys of @xcite and @xcite",
    ", n@xmath0h@xmath1 is often used as a tracer of dense , relatively quiescent cloud gas .",
    "its rotational lines are optically thin in low - mass dense cores .",
    "thus , they do not exhibit either self - absorption or blue - red asymmetry , but serve principally as a gauge of excitation temperature and as a comparison benchmark with lines that are sensitive to internal cloud motion .",
    "the rotational lines of cs are often optically thick , and can have asymmetric profiles that have long been interpreted kinematically @xcite . on the other hand , the infall signature is relatively weak in starless cores , in part because the polar molecule cs is depleted at high density from the gas phase onto grain mantles @xcite .",
    "finally , the rotational transition of hcn has the strongest infall signature of all , and the molecule appears to suffer little depletion @xcite .",
    "although our model cloud is a highly idealized isothermal sphere , the results of this study further lend credence to the underlying dynamical picture . for a representative 3@xmath4 cloud that has been contracting for 1  myr , we find that all the calculated line profiles resemble those observed , at least in an average sense .",
    "interestingly , the cs profile is only acceptable once we include central depletion of the molecule . in section  2 below ,",
    "we first describe our implementation of the radiative transfer program .",
    "section  3 then summarizes observations to date of the three molecules in starless dense cores .",
    "we describe , in section  4 , how the emergent line profiles alter when we change our physical input parameters .",
    "judging from these trends , we then select a canonical model cloud and compare its emission spectrum to the available data .",
    "finally , section  5 discusses limitations of the dynamical theory and the prospects for improvement .",
    "we also indicate how the model , even in its current , simplified form , can be used to assign contraction ages to individual starless cores .",
    "for each selected cloud model , we solve the equation of transfer numerically , using the code ratran @xcite .",
    "the basic strategy underlying this code is to choose randomly a set of cells outside the cloud that generate photons .",
    "these photons propagate through the cloud interior , while the molecular level populations are temporarily held fixed .",
    "the statistical equilibrium of the levels is then solved separately , whereupon photon propagation is reinitiated .",
    "the accelerated lambda iteration scheme introduced by @xcite ensures rapid convergence of the radiation field and level populations .",
    "treatment of non - isotropic scattering is cumbersome in this approach , so ratran does not include this effect .",
    "such a simplification is acceptable in the infrared and millimeter regime of interest .",
    "the code must be supplemented by tables of molecular data , containing energy levels , degeneracies , einstein a - values , and collisional rate coefficients . here",
    ", we utilized the leiden atomic and molecular database ( lamda ) .",
    "@xcite describe the construction of the database and its use .",
    "these tables include the full multiplets of rotational lines created by hyperfine splitting .",
    "in fact , recent observational studies of dense core kinematics have focused on individual hyperfine lines , as we will describe .    in order to display the line spectra",
    ", we utilized the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "we placed our cloud at a representative distance of 140  pc , and `` observed '' it with a gaussian beam of angular size @xmath5 . for comparison",
    ", our canonical cloud has a physical diameter of 0.27  pc , or 392@xmath6 at the selected distance . in constructing spectra , we assumed a velocity resolution of 0.01  km  s@xmath7 .",
    "we tested the radiative transfer calculation by first reproducing prior results for line profiles in a collapsing cloud .",
    "an early and influential work was that of @xcite .",
    "this study compared the self - similar collapse models of @xcite with that derived independently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated , for both models , cs rotational line profiles at various times , both before and after formation of the central protostar .    in testing both self - similar collapse models , @xcite assumed a gas kinetic temperature of 10  k. following @xcite , he augmented the shu model with a turbulent velocity of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant and @xmath10 is the local cloud density .",
    "the constant was determined empirically by @xcite to have the value .",
    "@xcite argued that this figure was likely to be an overestimate , since the observed `` turbulence '' could have included infall motion for dense cores containing stars .",
    "accordingly , he used a value of @xmath9 smaller by a factor of 0.25 .",
    "finally , he set the cs abundance , i.e. , the number density of the molecule relative to hydrogen , to @xmath11 , following @xcite .",
    "we provisionally adopted the same assumptions as @xcite and recalculated , using ratran , cs line profiles from the shu model for the period after protostar formation .",
    "all lines were viewed through the cloud center .",
    "the ratran code allows one to select @xmath12 , the total number of shells in the cloud , as well as @xmath13 , the ratio of outer to inner shell radii .",
    "we adjusted both numbers until we obtained the best match with the , , and profiles shown in figure  3d of @xcite . by choosing and",
    ", we obtained an excellent fit to all profiles for the four times considered by @xcite .",
    "agreement did not improve when either @xmath12 or @xmath13 was increased further .",
    "for example , the peak antenna temperatures @xmath14 changed by less than 0.1  % .",
    "we therefore retained these values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 in our subsequent calculations .    turning to starless dense cores",
    ", we continued to use a gas kinetic temperature of 10  k , corresponding to a thermal speed of .",
    "this temperature is on the low end of the range found empirically by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 2 ) . in any case , it is important to note that purely thermal line profiles are never seen , even at the centers of the most quiescent objects @xcite , and the prescription for turbulence in equation  ( 1 ) continues to provide a useful representation of the observations . in light of the comments by @xcite , we view @xmath9 as a free parameter , whose upper limit is likely to be the value advocated by @xcite .",
    "it is straighforward to incorporate turbulence into ratran , which allows a variable degree of intrinsic line broadening in each mass shell of the cloud .",
    "an additional free parameter is inherent in the theoretical model of paper  i. we envisioned the cloud undergoing a global oscillation , characterized by a nondimensional amplitude @xmath15 . for our standard initial conditions , @xmath15 gives the fractional deviation of the density from its unperturbed , equilibrium distribution ( see eq .  (",
    "17 ) and the discussion in  4.2 ) .",
    "the numerical integration of paper  i used a relatively large amplitude of , motivated by observation and analysis of the starless core b68 @xcite . here , we reset @xmath15 to the more modest , and perhaps more typical , value of 0.1 .",
    "we comment later on how changing @xmath15 affects the emergent line profiles .    with these assumptions ,",
    "the only remaining free parameters are the cloud mass @xmath16 and the time of observation @xmath17 .",
    "the zero point for @xmath17 is the onset of quasi - static contraction .",
    "both quantities must be related to the corresponding nondimensional ones , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , used in paper  i. our model cloud has a fixed nondimensional mass , , where the number results from numerical integration of the isothermal lane - emden equation . combining equation  ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) of paper  i",
    ", we find that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related by @xmath20 since @xmath18 and @xmath21 are either known or preset , the equation tells us , for any @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the appropriate @xmath19 to use from the model sequence .",
    "we further read off , at this point in the sequence , the distribution of the nondimensional density and velocity as functions of radius .",
    "the equations of  2.2 in paper  i tell us how to translate the quantities into dimensional form .. equation  ( 9 ) of paper  i allows us to solve for @xmath22 , given the dimensional cloud mass @xmath16 . ]",
    "after surveys had established the presence of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in star - forming regions , targeted observations were pursued in dense cores , including those already detected in nh@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it was found that the molecule selectively traces dense and quiescent gas , and is indeed absent in hotter and shocked material .",
    "the rotational transition , which has 7 hyperfine components , is usually optically thin in starless cores , but not always so .",
    "for example , the well - studied core l1544 shows an asymmetric profile toward the cloud center , extending over a region some 1400  au in radius @xcite .",
    "@xcite conducted the first largescale , systematic observations of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in starless dense cores .",
    "the 220 sources in their catalog had been selected primarily on the basis of optical obscuration .",
    "for the 72 objects detected in n@xmath0h@xmath1 , detailed study was made of the relatively isolated hyperfine line at 93.176  ghz .",
    "this line almost always has a gaussian profile , with no self - absorption or asymmetry .",
    "the mean measured peak intensity was , and the fwhm was .",
    "@xcite followed up these single - pointing observations with spatial maps of many individual cores .",
    "the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission is compact , with a well - defined central peak .",
    "diameters of the regions within the half - maximum contours range from 0.05 to 0.13  pc .",
    "[ [ cs ] ] cs ~~    these properties of n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission are in sharp contrast to those of the rotational line of cs at 97.981  ghz .",
    "@xcite found , in the 163 starless cores for which the line was detected , that a large fraction of the profiles were asymmetric and skewed toward the blue , either with two distinct peaks or , more commonly , a blue peak and a red shoulder ( see their figure  1 ) .",
    "detailed profiles vary from source to source , and there are even a few examples of double - peaked profiles stronger in the red .",
    "the subsequent mapping survey of @xcite showed that the region of cs asymmetry is relatively diffuse , and the emission is frequently depressed just where the n@xmath0h@xmath1 intensity peaks ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    with both the optically thin ( n@xmath0h@xmath1 ) and optically thick ( cs ) lines in hand , one may quantify the degree of blue - red asymmetry of the latter . @xcite introduced @xmath24 , the normalized velocity shift of cs .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath25 here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the peak , line - of - sight velocities of the two species .",
    "the peak velocity of n@xmath0h@xmath1 is assumed to represent the systematic motion of the cloud as a whole . in the single - pointing survey of @xcite , @xmath24 was usually negative , signifying that the profile peak is blueward of line center .",
    "the mean value of @xmath24 in this sample was @xmath28 .",
    "the rotational transition of hcn is the latest diagnostic tool for studying the kinematics of starless cores . as mentioned previously",
    ", the molecule suffers little depletion , at least for central densities less than @xcite .",
    "integrated intensity maps show that the hcn emission region is roughly coextensive with that of n@xmath0h@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the transition consists of three hyperfine lines of differing optical depth : @xmath29 at 88.634  ghz , @xmath30 at 88.632  ghz , and @xmath31 at 88.630  ghz , under optically thin , lte conditions , these would have intensity ratios of @xmath32 .",
    "of course , it is the fact that these lines are optically thick in starless cores that makes them useful kinematic probes .",
    "@xcite conducted single - pointing observations for hcn in 85 starless cores , netting 64 detections .",
    "the profiles of all three hyperfine lines are distinctly non - gaussian , displaying either two peaks with a self - aborption dip or a single peak with a shoulder . not surprisingly , the central dip is strongest in the optically thickest @xmath30 line , which also shows the greatest blue - red asymmetry .",
    "but a central result of this study is the heterogeneity of the profiles . while 43  percent of the sources have at least one or two double - peaked hyperfine lines skewed to the blue , 33  percent have blueward and redward asymmetries mixed in the three lines .",
    "nevertheless , the overall tendency is for profiles indicative of contraction , rather than expansion . in analogy with equation  ( 3 ) , @xcite defined @xmath33 , a normalized velocity shift with respect to n@xmath0h@xmath1 . for each hyperfine line ,",
    "the large majority of sources are observed to have negative @xmath33 ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "the actual magnitudes of @xmath33 are larger than for cs .",
    "the mean values are @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the magnitudes are tightly correlated , in the sense that a source with greater @xmath37 in the @xmath29 line also has a greater shift in @xmath30 and @xmath31 . within each source",
    ", however , there is no clear pattern for the relative magnitudes of the velocity shifts for the three lines , nor for the relative intensities of the lines . in other words",
    ", starless cores frequently exhibit hcn `` intensity anomalies '' with respect to lte , a phenomenon that has long been noted and studied in other molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because of the range in optical depths in the three lines , the profiles of hcn are potentially useful for tracing the full velocity structure of a dense core .",
    "@xcite constructed single - dish spatial maps of emission for two starless cores , l694 - 2 and l1197 . to complement their observations",
    ", they also performed a radiative transfer calculation in spherical cloud models with adjustable density and velocity profiles .",
    "interestingly , monotonic velocity profiles do not match the data .",
    "for both starless cores , @xcite found that the inferred contraction speed begins relatively small at the cloud edge , reaches a maximum about halfway inward in radius , and thereafter declines toward the cloud center .",
    "this type of velocity profile emerges naturally from our dynamical model ( paper  i ; figure  4 ) .",
    "after setting the oscillation amplitude to , we next gauge how the line profiles , still viewed through the cloud center , change as the other parameters are varied .",
    "these trends enable us to seek a model whose lines best match the data in an average sense . recall that our remaining free parameters are : @xmath9 , the turbulence coefficient in equation  ( 1 ) , the cloud mass @xmath16 , and the time @xmath17 since the start of inward motion .",
    "the updated molecular abundances we used in the transfer code were : @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "we first explored the effect of altering the cloud mass at fixed @xmath9 and @xmath17 .",
    "following @xcite , we focused on the hyperfine line of n@xmath0h@xmath1.h@xmath1 table of lamda lists 3 lines at 93.176  ghz corresponding to the transitions , , and .",
    "the lower levels are also listed as being degenerate in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "assuming the three individual lines can not be resolved in practice , we added their intensities . ] as @xmath16 is raised , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line remains gaussian , and is therefore still optically thin . of course , the total emission increases with @xmath16 , so that @xmath38 also rises .    in cs and hcn lines exhibiting self - absorption ,",
    "these dips eventually disappear with increasing cloud mass .",
    "this tendency is easy enough to understand . according to equation  ( 2 ) ,",
    "an increase of @xmath16 at fixed @xmath17 necessitates a lower @xmath19 .",
    "we are viewing our fiducial , contracting cloud at an earlier nondimensional time , when the cloud radius @xmath39 was larger .",
    "but equations  ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , and ( 12 ) of paper  i imply that @xmath40 since @xmath41 falls , the column density through the cloud _ decreases _ with increasing @xmath16 .",
    "many observed lines , especially those of hcn , show clear self - absorption .",
    "thus , the sensitivity of the calculated profiles effectively sets a ceiling on the allowable range of cloud masses .",
    "a similar disappearance of the self - absorption dips in cs and hcn occurs when we fix @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but increase @xmath9 .",
    "a larger value of @xmath9 corresponds to a greater velocity dispersion throughout the cloud .",
    "the gas consequently has a higher , overall excitation temperature , so there is less of the absorption that creates central line dips . by the same token , the optically thin n@xmath0h@xmath1 line broadens , i.e. , @xmath42 increases . both trends",
    "help us to set bounds on @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we may fix @xmath16 and @xmath9 , and consider various evolutionary times @xmath17 . at greater @xmath17 , the maximum infall speed within the cloud increases .",
    "thus , the blue / red asymmetry of all optically thick lines becomes more pronounced .",
    "quantitatively , both @xmath43 and @xmath44 which are both negative , become larger in magnitude .",
    "figure  1 shows that the overall emission in n@xmath0h@xmath1 increases with time , a reflection of the higher cloud density .",
    "the line peak grows faster than its width , with the result that @xmath45 declines . in the figure ,",
    "the fwhm is at the initial instant , and at the last time shown ( ) .      rather than attempt to find , within the model parameter space , matches to individual dense cores",
    ", we sought first a combination of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath9 that reproduces the general , observed characteristics of the various line profiles , as summarized in  3 .",
    "some experimentation was required , in light of the constraints just given .",
    "however , a suitable parameter set quickly emerged .",
    "if we set , , and ( i.e. , 0.5 times the original value found by @xcite ) , then the profiles are generally consistent with the data .",
    "following our previous discussion , it is the magnitude of the self - absorption dip that is most sensitive to variations in these parameters .",
    "we may accordingly gauge the acceptable range of parameter values by noting when the dips depart substantially from those in the canonical model .",
    "holding @xmath17 and @xmath9 fixed while allowing @xmath16 to range from 2.7 to @xmath46 , the magnitude of the dip in the @xmath47 line of hcn changed by less than 25  % in either direction . by the analogous measure",
    ", @xmath17 can vary from 0.8 to 1.2  myr , and @xmath9 from 3.3 to .",
    "the topmost curve in figure  1 shows the calculated n@xmath0h@xmath1 profile for the canonical model .",
    "as in nearly all observed cases , the line is symmetric and guassian .",
    "our fwhm of 0.21  km  s@xmath7 is on the low end of the observed range , as would be expected given our assumed kinetic temperature of 10  k. conversely , our t@xmath48-value of 0.33  k is higher than the average . here",
    ", of course , the beam efficiency ( assumed to be unity in ratran ) comes into play , as do the various distances to the observed dense cores .",
    "figure  2 ( dashed curve ) shows the emergent profile of cs through the center of the canonical cloud model .",
    "because of higher optical depth , the line is markedly asymmetric , as the data also show .",
    "however , while the sense of the asymmetry in this calculated profile is correct , the deep , self - absorption dip is rarely seen ( compare figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "what is observed instead is a relatively broad , redshifted shoulder joining onto a blueshifted peak .",
    "we may recover this shape by introducing depletion of the molecule , presumably caused by adsorption onto grain surfaces .",
    "@xcite invoked such depletion to improve the observational match of their cs spatial intensity maps .",
    "following these authors , we assume a centrally depressed , radial profile for the relative number density : @xmath49   \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath50 is the usual interstellar value of @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the cloud number density , and the threshold density @xmath53 is a free parameter . for the solid profile in figure  2 , we used . as a comparison , table  4 of @xcite lists @xmath53-values ranging from 1 to @xmath54 for five starless cores . our calculated relative velocity shift , ,",
    "is equal to the mean observed @xcite .",
    "the three hyperfine lines of hcn ( figure  3 ) exhibit more diverse profile shapes .",
    "the optically thinnest @xmath55 transition has a blue peak / red shoulder profile , similar to that in cs .",
    "the other two lines exhibit clear self - absorption , with the deepest trough being found in the optically thickest , @xmath47 line .",
    "scanning figure  1 of @xcite , we see that this pattern is commonly seen ( e.g. , l63 , l1197 ) , but is by no means universal ( e.g. , l1544 ) . our calculated relative velocity shifts , @xmath56 , for the ( 0 - 1 ) , ( 2 - 1 ) , and ( 1 - 1 ) lines are -0.33 , -0.81 , and -0.67 , respectively .",
    "as mentioned earlier , observations give similar values for all three lines , with a mean of about -0.5 .",
    "we are further encouraged by this qualitiative agreement .",
    "we stress that calculated line profiles are quite sensitive to the interior dynamics of the cloud , and thus do provide a worthwhile test of the underlying theory . to further illustrate this point , we recalculated all profiles using the collapse model of @xcite .",
    "we again set , where the zero of time now refers to the start of inside - out collapse .",
    "for , the mass of the central protostar in the model is @xmath57 . in calculating profiles",
    ", we used the same velocity dispersion parameter , , as in our canonical model .",
    "all calculated line profiles are now far broader than those observed . for example , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 profile , while remaining symmetric , is distinctly non - gaussian , with a shallow , central depression and wings extending to on either side of line center .",
    "optically thick lines have profiles that are much too asymmetric .",
    "our point here is _ not _ that the shu model is a poor representation of starless cores , which was to be expected .",
    "the message is rather that the gas motions induced by a central protostar of solar - type mass are qualitatively different from those in our slowly contracting , starless cloud , and in a manner clearly reflected in the molecular line profiles .      our canonical value of the oscillation amplitude @xmath15 , while guided by the scant observational data available , is still rather arbritrary .",
    "how , in the future , can we pin down this parameter when we examine specific dense cores ?",
    "even more importantly , will we be able to gauge the cloud s contraction age through comparison between real and model - generated line profiles ?",
    "these questions are related .",
    "we remarked in paper  i that an increase of @xmath15 , if accompanied by a _ decrease _ in the evolutionary time , could leave the cloud largely unchanged .",
    "if that were the case , it would be difficult to ascertain @xmath15 and @xmath17 individually .",
    "specifically , our cloud model , at a given @xmath15 and nondimensional time @xmath19 , attains nearly the same contraction velocity as one at a different amplitude @xmath58 and nondimensional time .",
    "the nondimensional time scales as the inverse square of the amplitude because cloud contraction is driven by a second - order perturbation",
    ". the dimensional time may be obtained from the nondimensional one through equation  ( 2 ) .",
    "does this scaling relation mean that line profiles are degenerate in @xmath15 and @xmath17 ?",
    "armed with ratran , we now demonstrate that this is fortunately not the case .",
    "figure  4 shows in detail the effect of trading amplitude and age .",
    "the solid curve in the lefthand panel is the velocity profile in our canonical model (; ) .",
    "the dashed curve is the profile for a cloud with the same mass of , but with and . as predicted , the velocities are quite similar . on the other hand ,",
    "the internal _ densities _ differ greatly .",
    "the righthand panel shows that the cloud with larger @xmath15 has a lower central density , since it was initially more inflated and evolved over a shorter time .",
    "the net result is that the line profiles also do not match . as an example , figure  5 displays the three hyperfine lines of hcn .",
    "the degree of blue / red asymmetry in all the profiles is markedly less than in the canonical model . for the optically thinnest , @xmath55 line ,",
    "the profile is nearly gaussian .",
    "the normalized velocity shift @xmath56 is only , well below typical observed values .    what happens if we keep , but increase @xmath17 back to ? for our model to be useful observationally , the resulting line profiles should again differ noticeably from the canonical case .",
    "indeed they do , and in the opposite sense as the previous example .",
    "both the cs and hcn profiles now exhibit _ too much _ asymmetry .",
    "for example , the red wing of the @xmath55 line of hcn degenerates to a shoulder ; a similar profile is seen in cs . according to figure  1 of @xcite , this development reflects relatively high infall speed .",
    "in fact , the maximum infall speed for this choice of parameters is 0.06  km  s@xmath7 , three times that in the canonical one .",
    "the central density is also higher by about the same factor .",
    "consequently , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 line , while maintaining a gaussian profile , has a @xmath14-value of 0.85  k , significantly above the range reported by @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the calculated cs profile is not even qualitatively correct unless we include the effect of depletion onto grain surfaces .",
    "our strategy , following previous authors , was simply to introduce a spatial variation in the molecular abundance . nevertheless , our canonical model still assumes a uniform distribution of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and hcn .",
    "this simplification also bears examination .",
    "the detailed abundance of any species is influenced not only by the efficiency of grain absorption but also by the cloud dynamics itself .",
    "the latter point was emphasized in the pioneering study by @xcite , who followed a time - dependent chemical reaction network in models of collapsing dense cores .",
    "utilizing a radiative transfer code , these authors demonstrated , as we did in  4.2 , the sensitivity of emergent molecular line profiles to the cloud s internal velocity structure .",
    "not only is there a direct , kinematic effect , but various species may not have time to achieve chemical equilibrium , creating abundance gradients that also influence line profiles . in a more recent work , @xcite found that the fractional abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 falls by an order of magnitude from cloud center to edge within a cloud undergoing inside - out collapse ( see their fig .  3 ) .",
    "to account fully for the interplay of dynamics and chemistry , we would also need to follow simultaneously both a chemical reaction network and line transfer in our evolving cloud model .",
    "needless to say , such an undertaking is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "however , we may assess in a general way the effect of abundance gradients .",
    "consider the optically thick lines of hcn , whose profiles should be especially sensitive . in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we adopt a linear variation of the relative hcn abundance : @xmath59 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath60 is the mass contained within any radius @xmath61 and @xmath50 is the nominal abundance we used previously . within our canonical model ,",
    "we vary the nondimensional slope @xmath62 and calculate the emergent hcn profiles",
    ".    the slope @xmath62 can not exceed 2 in absolute value , since @xmath63 would then become negative at either the cloud center or edge . for smaller , but substantial , values of @xmath64 , the most significant effect is on the depth of the self - absorption dip .",
    "figure  6 shows how the optically thickest , @xmath65 , line profile changes as @xmath62 ranges from -0.5 through 0 ( uniform abundance ) , to + 0.5 . according to the standard gauge of the relative velocity shift ,",
    "the effect is minor . for",
    ", @xmath33 is 6  % greater in magnitude than the canonical value , while the shift is 6  % less for .",
    "nevertheless , the degree of self - absorption diminishes markedly for positive @xmath62 , i.e. , when hcn is concentrated in the more slowly moving , outer portion of the cloud . to restore the dip to its original magnitude , the contraction age for the cloud would need to increase slightly from the canonical 1.0  myr to 1.2  myr .",
    "we conclude that , while coupled chemical and dynamical models are preferable in principle , such extensive effort is unnecessary for beginning a quantitative assessment of starless core properties .",
    "this suite of radiative transfer calculations performed on our theoretical cloud model has yielded two important findings .",
    "first , we have been able to match the generic , observed properties of the selected line profiles using a reasonable cloud mass , turbulent velocity dispersion , and evolutionary time .",
    "this success may indicate that the model has captured the essential physics of the contraction process itself .",
    "note also that the accelerating character of the contraction in our theory explains naturally the key observation that starless cores of lower density exhibit less asymmetry in their line profiles @xcite .",
    "second , the sensitivity of the emergent line profiles to the input parameters means that the model offers a practical route to gauge starless core properties that have previously been difficult to ascertain .",
    "for example , given the empirical mass and kinetic temperature of an object , the matching of line profiles would yield a first estimate of its contraction age . obtaining ages for numerous starless cores in different environments would aid greatly in understanding the onset of star formation .",
    "of course , the observations offer more detail than the model can explain , at least in its current , highly idealized form .",
    "we can not yet account for the rather surprising spatial extent of asymmetric cs emission @xcite .",
    "nor can we explain the relative intensities of the hcn hyperfine lines @xcite .",
    "explaining both features of the data may require alterations in the spatial abundance gradients , in the manner employed in sections 4.2 and 4.4 .",
    "additionally , an improved model would consider more carefully how the interior , relatively quiescent gas joins onto surrounding , more turbulent , material .",
    "in fact , it has long been realized that the pattern of hcn hyperfine anomalies requires the presence of an envelope of relatively high excitation temperature @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently simulated the birth of dense cores out of spherical , converging flows .",
    "such calculations , when extended to three dimensions , may offer additional insight into the nature of the core - envelope transition .",
    "finally , we must face the obvious fact that real starless cores are not spherical , as the model currently assumes .",
    "the shapes of these objects may be partially determined by the anisotropic pressure of their turbulent environments , as found in recent simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another important factor setting the gross core properties is the force associated with the internal magnetic field @xcite",
    ". it would be instructive to study , using the method of paper  i , the onset of collapse in marginally stable , magnetostatic equilibria , such as those found by @xcite .",
    "such an investigation would add a significant degree of realism to our picture of protostellar collapse .",
    "we are grateful to floris van der tak , one of the authors of ratran , for guiding us in the proper use of the code .",
