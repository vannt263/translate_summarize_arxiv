    "these approaches have in common that the noise is due to the residual part of the interactions acting on top of the mean field .",
    "however they generally differ on the strategy used to incorporate noise . in some cases , the residual interaction is treated using statistical assumptions @xcite , while in other cases the interaction induces fluctuations in the wave - packets either by random phase - shifts @xcite or by quantum jumps according to the fermi - golden rule @xcite .",

    "these theories provide an exact stochastic formulation of quantum problems and lead to the so - called quantum monte - carlo methods @xcite .",
    "recent applications to nuclear physics have shown that stochastic methods can be applied successfully to describe the structure of nuclei @xcite .",
    "these methods can also be applied to the description of dynamical properties @xcite .",

    ", we would like to mention that the approximate stochastic formulation has the same limitations at extended tdhf and can only be applied to problems for which the residual correlations are weak .",
    "the main result of our work is the proof that the exact dynamics of a correlated system evolving through a two - body hamiltonian can be replaced by a set of stochastic evolutions of one - body density matrices where each density evolves according to its own mean field augmented by a one - body noise .",
    "guided by the exact stochastic formulation , an approximate stochastic mean field theory valid in the weak coupling limit is proposed . in this theory , jumps occur on a coarse - grained time scale .",
    "the alternative stochastic formulation presented here does avoid some of the ambiguities present in other stochastic theories .",
    "a first remarkable aspect comes from the justification of the noise source .",
    "indeed , since the starting point of our work is an exact formulation of the many - body problem , the noise has an unambiguous mathematical and physical interpretation .",
    "in addition , from a practical point of view , it has clearly some advantages . in all applications to quantum problems of extended mean field theory ,",
    "it has been shown that the memory effect is important ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "this memory effect corresponds to the non - local action in time of the past history collisions on the future dynamics .",
    "although the noise is markovian , it accounts also for this non - markovian effect through the instantaneous average over trajectories .",
    "in addition , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to apply stochastic theories proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to large amplitude motions , one should be able to guess what will be the important states in the future evolution .",
    "this is in particular necessary to reduce the number of trajectories .",
    "for instance , it has been guessed in ref .",
    "@xcite that jumps can be optimized due to the 2 particle-2 hole ( 2p-2h ) nature of the residual interaction . in the theory developed here ,",
    "the system is driven naturally towards the important states . indeed , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : stocone ] ) , these states are self - consistently defined without ambiguity , and the 2p-2h character of the residual interaction directly shows up in the stochastic part of the propagator .",
    "the exact treatment of the many - body problem with stochastic theories is still not possible for realistic large amplitude dynamics due to the required numerical effort .",
    "however , an alternative formulation of the stochastic theory has been proposed in the second part of this article which should make the numerical applications easier .",
    "this stochastic theory provides a suitable framework for the description of interacting systems in the weak coupling regime .",
    "in particular , it keeps the advantages discussed above and it is expected to significantly reduce the numerical efforts for practical applications . such a theory could a priori be applied to nuclear systems where quantum and dissipative effects are important such as for instance giant resonances , fusion reactions or the thermalization in nuclear reactions .",
    "finally we would like to mention that an additional difficulty may be encountered due to the possible progressive entanglement of the initial state .",
    "indeed , starting from an initial simple state , the states propagated with stochastic schroedinger equation will progressively become more complicated and fragmented over phase space .",
    "if such an entanglement occurs , the method proposed here might be very difficult or even impossible to use ."
