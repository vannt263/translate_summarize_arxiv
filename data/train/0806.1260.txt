    "extragalactic jets constitute the longest collimated structures in the universe .",
    "they transport huge amounts of energy from the nuclei of active galaxies out to kpc or mpc distances , significantly affecting the properties of the surrounding intracluster / intergalactic medium .",
    "jets have been extensively studied in the radio domain on different scales since the very beginning of the development of modern radio interferometers ( bridle & perley 1984 , begelman et al .",
    "more recently , the excellent spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( and , to a lesser extent , of other x - ray satellites like _ xmm - newton _ ) has allowed us to image large - scale structures in powerful extragalactic radio sources at x - ray frequencies as well , and thus has opened a new era in studying the high energy emission of these objects .",
    "more than 100 radio - loud agns are now known to possess x - ray counterparts to their radio jets , hotspots or lobes on kpc - to - mpc scales ( e.g. , harris & krawczynski 2002 ; 2006 , stawarz 2003 , hardcastle et al . 2004 , sambruna et al . 2004 ,",
    "kataoka & stawarz 2005 , marshall et al .",
    "2005a , croston et al .",
    "2005 , tavecchio et al .",
    "2005 , hardcastle 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray emission observed from the extended lobes is well understood and modeled in terms of the inverse comptonization of the cosmic microwave background photons by the low - energy electrons ( ic / cmb ; see the discussion in kataoka & stawarz 2005 , and croston et al .",
    "2005 ) , providing strong evidence for approximate energy equipartition between the radiating electrons and the lobe magnetic field ( with the particle pressure dominating over the magnetic pressure by up to one order of magnitude ) . however , the origin of the @xmath3kev radiation detected from the large - scale jets and hotspots is still widely debated and , to some extent , controversial .",
    "the x - ray emission of the terminal regions ( the hotspots ) of _ powerful _ jets is consistent with the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission model , in which radio - emitting electrons accelerated at the terminal shock inverse - compton - scatter synchrotron radio photons to kev energies ( e.g. , hardcastle et al .",
    "2004 , kataoka & stawarz 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "modeling of x - rays from this emission process allows us to extract several crucial jet parameters .",
    "in particular , the observations imply rough equipartition of the energy densities stored in radiating electrons , @xmath4 , and magnetic field , @xmath5 , and it has been argued that they indicate a dynamical role for non - relativistic protons in the outflow ( see stawarz et al .",
    "2007 for the case of the radio galaxy cygnus a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray emission of the hotspots in _ low - power _ jets is in disagreement with the predictions of the simple ssc model ( see the discussion in hardcastle et al .",
    "the complex x - ray morphology and spectral character of the broad - band hotspot emission in objects like 3c  227 or 3c  327 suggest instead that we are seeing synchrotron emission from high - energy electrons accelerated continuously in the extended and turbulent jet termination regions ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2007a , fan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the origin of the bright x - ray knots within the jets themselves ( hereafter ` jet knots ' ) is also a matter of a debate . in nearby , low - power fr  i sources ( like m  87 and centaurus  a ) , the typical radio - to - x - ray spectra of the jet knots are consistent with a single smoothly broken power - law continuum , indicating synchrotron radiation from a single electron population extending up to the highest energies ( @xmath6 ; e.g. , marshall et al .",
    "2002 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2003 ) . yet",
    "the particular acceleration processes involved , the multi - component character of the high - energy emission , and the main factors determining the spectral shape of the broad - band jet emission , are far from being understood ( see the discussions in , e.g. , kataoka et al . 2006 , laing et al .",
    "2006a , honda & honda 2007 ) .    the most controversial issue , however , is the origin of the intense x - ray emission detected from knots in powerful quasar jets , such as pks  0637@xmath7752 or 3c  273 ( schwartz et al .",
    "2000 , marshall et al .",
    "2001 , respectively ) . here",
    "the x - ray knot spectra are much brighter than expected from a simple extrapolation of the radio - to - optical synchrotron continua , indicating that an additional or separate spectral component dominates the jet s radiative output at high ( x - ray ) photon energies .",
    "very often , this emission is modeled in terms of inverse - comptonization of the cmb photon field by low - energy ( @xmath8 ) electrons ( tavecchio et al . 2000 , celotti et al .",
    "2001 ) , which typically requires highly relativistic jet bulk velocities on kpc - mpc scales in order to maintain rough equipartition between electrons and magnetic field and to fulfill the minimum power condition .",
    "the derived jet bulk lorentz factors @xmath9 are comparable to those inferred for the pc - scale jets ; ( harris & krawczynski 2002 , sambruna et al .",
    "2004 , marshall et al .",
    "unfortunately , the global dynamics of large - scale jets in powerful sources are largely unknown , and different arguments in favor of and against highly relativistic bulk velocities on kpc - mpc scales ( obtained by means of the analysis of the radio or optical jet emission ; e.g. , wardle & aaron 1997 , hardcastle et al . 1999 ,",
    "scarpa & urry 2002 ) , are not conclusive .",
    "thus , the ic / cmb model may be considered to be strong support for the idea that these outflows do indeed propagate from sub - pc scales with little energy dissipation , efficiently transporting energy in the form of bulk kinetic motion , and depositing it far away from the active nuclei ( tavecchio et al . 2004 ; 2007 ,",
    "sambruna et al .",
    "2006 ; but see the discussion in hardcastle 2006 ) .",
    "this important conclusion is often claimed to be consistent with the observed one - sideness of the extragalactic x - ray jets detected by _",
    "chandra _ , since jet one - sideness is a simple and natural consequence of relativistic beaming .    on the other hand ,",
    "if there is significant beaming in powerful jets on large scales , then the detection of bright x - ray jet emission from fr  ii radio galaxies , which are believed to be analogous systems to radio loud quasars but to be viewed with the jets at large angles to the line of sight , should be considered as unlikely .",
    "such emission has , however , been detected in several objects ( e.g. , 3c  303 , 3c  15 ,",
    "pictor  a , or 3c  403 ; see kataoka et al .",
    "2003a , b , hardcastle & croston 2005 , and kraft et al . 2005 , respectively ) .",
    "obviously , detection of any x - ray counterjet would be of primary importance in this respect , since it would automatically exclude significant beaming , and thus impose very severe constraints on the jet emission models . in fr  i sources , where the emission mechanism is generally supposed to be synchrotron , possible or likely detections of x - ray counterjets have been reported in 3c  270 and centaurus  a ( chiaberge et al",
    ". 2003 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2007b , respectively ) . in the latter case",
    "the counterjet detection is almost certain , since _ extended _ x - ray emission coincident with the _ extended _ radio features in the receding jet rules out a claim that all of the observed x - ray counterparts to the radio counter - knots may be due to chance coincidence of the jet - related radio features with x - ray binaries of the centaurus  a host galaxy .",
    "however , in more powerful sources , there has been no definitive counterjet detection to date .",
    "possible counterjets have been reported in the intermediate fr  i / fr  ii object 4c  29.30 ( sambruna et al .",
    "2004 ) , as well as in the broad - line fr  ii radio galaxy pictor  a ( hardcastle & croston 2005 ) .",
    "in these cases , it is unclear whether the x - ray emission is non - thermal in nature , because with the available very limited photon statistics any detailed spectral analysis is impossible , and in addition it is rather difficult to claim one - to - one morphological correspondence between the x - ray and radio structures ( especially since the counterjet in the prototype fr  ii source pictor  a is not detected at radio frequencies ) . in x - ray maps of the classical double ( narrow - line fr  ii radio galaxy ) cygnus  a , linear features aligned  but not co - spatial  with the radio jet and the counterjet have been noted , but their direct connection with the radio jet plasma is extremely vague ( smith et al .",
    "2002 , steenbrugge et al .",
    "it is then possible that in this , and some other possible x - ray counterjet sources , the aligned x - ray structures on the counterjet side are due to thermal radiation of shocked galactic / intergalactic gas interacting with the jet plasma , as observed in the distant ( @xmath10 ) radio galaxy pks  1138 - 262 ( carilli et al .",
    "we note in this context that cygnus  a is located in the very center of a rich cluster environment , while the restarting 4c  29.30 radio galaxy is known to have clear signatures of the interaction between the radio jets and the ambient line - emitting gas ( van breugel et al .",
    "1986 , jamrozy et al .",
    "2007 ) . a clear spatial association between the radio and x - ray jets and the capability to distinguish non - thermal and thermal emission are the key requirements for a convincing counterjet detection in a powerful source .",
    "an alternative to the inverse - compton model as an interpretation of the x - ray emission of powerful jets involves synchrotron emission from high - energy electrons , which , in order to be consistent with the constraints on optical emission , must often either be characterized by a ` non - standard ' ( concave ) energy distribution , or must constitute a separate population to the ones emitting the radio - to - optical continuum .",
    "it has been noted that such an electron population can arise due to the continuous and efficient stochastic acceleration processes expected to take place within the extended jet volumes ( stawarz et al .",
    "2004 ) , and will be seen preferentially within turbulent jet boundary layers with significant velocity shear ( stawarz & ostrowski 2002 ) . a very strong support for the synchrotron hypothesis",
    "was recently provided by detailed multiwavelength observations of the jet in the quasar 3c  273 ( jester et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 , uchiyama et al .",
    "the observations showed in particular that the x - ray spectra are significantly softer than the radio spectra in most regions of the 3c  273 outflow , and that they are compatible with extrapolating the x - ray power law down to the polarized ( and therefore synchrotron in origin ) uv / optical continuum .",
    "these findings are in strong disagreement with the predictions of the ic / cmb model .",
    "in addition , a detailed analysis of the broad - band emission of several other quasar jets supports the synchrotron hypothesis , pointing out an important role of the jet velocity structure ( consisting of a fast spine and a slower boundary layer / outer sheath ) in shaping the jet high - energy radiation ( e.g. , hardcastle 2006 , jester et al .",
    "2006 , siemiginowska et al .",
    "such jet velocity structure is in fact always seen in numerical modeling of the evolution and propagation of extragalactic relativistic jets ( e.g. , aloy et al .",
    "1999 , leismann et al .",
    "2005 , mizuno et al .",
    "2007 ) , since it results inevitably from the non - linear growth of kelvin - helmholtz instabilities on the jet surface ( see the recent studies by perucho et al .",
    "2007 , hardee 2007 , meliani & keppens 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "it is not yet established , however , if the jet boundary layers are indeed the places of the enhanced acceleration of high - energy particles . nor is the exact velocity profile at the jet boundaries precisely known ; in fact , there are reasons to believe it may be far from the widely expected monotonic one , and may even exhibit a sharp increase in the bulk velocity of the outflow at the jet edges ( aloy & rezzolla 2006 , mizuno et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the radiative signatures of such ` anomalous ' shear layers , in the context of the high - energy emission from extragalactic large - scale jets , were recently investigated by aloy & mimica ( 2008 ) .",
    "observational studies of the velocity structure of extragalactic jets and its relationship to their broad - band emission are hampered by the difficulties in resolving the outflows transversely , especially at high energies .",
    "detailed radio studies and sophisticated modeling of the polarization and total intensity in the radio of several nearby fr  i sources ( like 3c  31 , ngc  315 , or 3c  296 ; laing & bridle 2004 , laing et al . 2006a ,",
    "b , respectively ) do reveal jet radial velocity structures , and indicate that the flatter - spectrum radio regions are indeed often associated with the jet boundary shear layers .",
    "unfortunately , only a few kpc - scale low - power jets , e.g. , the one hosted by the radio galaxy centaurus  a , can be resolved at x - ray frequencies by the _",
    "chandra _ instrument .",
    "the cen a observations show interestingly limb - brightened x - ray morphology , but there is no obvious relation with the spectral shape of the synchrotron x - ray continuum ( hardcastle et al .",
    "2003 , 2007b , kataoka et al .",
    "2006 , worrall et al .",
    "in particular , the diffuse component of the centaurus  a x - ray jet is characterized by a constant spectral index across the jet ( kataoka et al .",
    "2006 ) , while the x - ray spectra of isolated knots seem to be steeper within the jet sheath when compared to the x - ray spectra of the knots within the spine ( worrall et al .",
    "recently , two ` intermediate ' fr  i / fr  ii jets in the bl lacertae objects 3c  371 and pks  2201 + 44 were also resolved transversely in x - rays ( sambruna et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the observations indicated a synchrotron origin of the detected kev photons from all the jet components , and suggested slightly steeper x - ray spectra of the jet edges when compared with the jet spines .",
    "interestingly , the width of the x - ray jets in these two sources is not smaller than the widths of their optical and radio counterparts . needless to say ,",
    "no quasar or powerful fr  ii jet has been resolved till now at x - ray frequencies .",
    "this is true even for the particularly bright and wide 3c  273 jet , which , although imaged in detail at optical and radio frequencies ( jester et al .",
    "2005 ) , can not be resolved transversely at higher photon energies . for this source ,",
    "however , the limits to the width of the x - ray jet are smaller than the sized measured in the optical and radio bands at the position of the bright knots ( jester et al .",
    "2006 ) , but not necessarily in the interknot regions ( see marshall et al .",
    "2005b ) .",
    "the fr ii radio galaxy 3c  353 provides one of the best - known examples of fr ii jets that can be resolved at both radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "3c  353 ( @xmath11 ) is the fourth strongest radio source in the 3c catalog , with a total flux density @xmath12jy at @xmath13ghz , and a projected size @xmath14 .",
    "it exhibits hotspots and a pair of large - scale fr  ii - type jets , clearly visible within filamentary lobes ( swain et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the jets in 3c  353 , constituting about @xmath15 of the entire source luminosity , are well collimated trains of knots with an average width @xmath16 and jet - counterjet radio brightness asymmetry @xmath17 ( swain 1996 ) .",
    "both total and polarized intensity profiles across the jets indicate that the bulk of the jet radio emission is produced at the jet edges , and so presumably within a boundary shear layer ( swain 1996 , swain et al .",
    "1998 ) . since these jets are among only a very few fr  ii jets wide enough to be resolved in x - rays , we planned and conducted a deep _ chandra _ observation of 3c  353 , in order to investigate the multiwavelength structure of powerful fr  ii outflows .",

    "the nucleus and lobes will briefly be discussed further in  [ sec : frii ] and  [ sec : origin ] respectively , but since our major findings above are all related to the jets , the remainder of the paper mostly focuses on the interpretation of the observed x - ray jet emission . before this , however , let us comment on the question of whether 3c  353 is indeed representative of other quasar / fr  ii jet sources .",
    "there are some reasons one might suspect that 3c  353 is not representative of other powerful fr  ii - type jets .",
    "first , 3c  353 is located in the outskirts of a merging cluster , which is not a typical environment for classical doubles or radio loud quasars .",
    "second , one may note the apparent lack of the x - ray signatures for the cavity inflated in the cluster medium by the expanding lobes of 3c  353 , like those observed in , e.g. , cygnus  a ( smith et al . 2002 ) .",
    "and third , the particular morphology of the radio hotspots in the discussed object might be thought to be unusual for an fr  ii radio galaxy : the east ( main jet ) hotspot is located in the middle  and not at the edge , as expected  of the fat east lobe , while the counterjet terminates in the elongated west lobe without forming a ` classical ' hotspot , but instead splits into a mushroom - shaped vortex ring ( see figure  [ fig : rad_img ] ) .",
    "this type of jet morphology might rather be thought to resemble the ` inner hotspots ' , or ` flaring regions ' observed in narrow angle tailed ( nat ) sources at the point where the substantially curved jets suddenly lose their collimation but continue to propagate away from the nucleus rather than terminating and forming backflow ( see in this context eilek et al .",
    "interestingly , nat sources are typically ( exclusively ) located in the outskirts of rich clusters .",
    "we therefore considered the possibility that 3c  353 is a nat radio galaxy observed in projection , with the line of sight being almost in the jet bending plane .",
    "the first reason to doubt the above interpretation is the very low probability that the line of sight would be exactly in the plane in which the nat jet was bending . with any other orientation of the source in the sky",
    ", one should expect to observe some gradual curvature of the 3c  353 outflows , or at least some misalignment between the jet and the counterjet axes .",
    "by contrast , the jets in 3c  353 are very straight all over their lengths . as for the jet misalignment",
    ", we have carefully investigated the available radio maps , and found only a small difference between the two axes : if a line is drawn from the nucleus out to follow the west jet , and another from the nucleus to follow the east jet , the position angles of the lines differ by @xmath159 . if , instead , we aim for similar size ellipses , one fitting the hotspot region at the end of the counterjet and the other ( of the same size ) fitting the brightest jet termination feature of the main jet , the lines differ by @xmath160 only .",
    "the other problem is that the jets in nat sources are of the fr  i type , while both the jets in 3c  353  extremely well collimated outflows with a half - opening angle @xmath161  are clear examples of the type of jets seen in fr  iis ( swain 1996 , swain et al .",
    "also , the apparent lack of any signatures for the x - ray cavity inflated in the ambient medium by the expanding lobes may be explained if 3c  353 is in reality located in front of or behind the cluster mid - plane , as was argued by g08 based on an analysis of pressure balance ; even if the source were in the plane of the cluster it is unlikely that a strong cavity signature would be observed at the observed distance from the cluster center . finally",
    ", the recessed hotspot observed in the east lobe of 3c  353 is not particularly unusual for classical doubles ( mullin et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "there are also many positive reasons for believing 3c  353 is a fairly typical fr  ii object , and here we briefly summarize them : ( i ) the total radio power of 3c  353 , @xmath162whz@xmath23 , is an order of magnitude above the borderline between fr  is and fr  iis ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) ; ( ii ) the spectral properties of the x - ray nucleus in 3c  353 , in particular a large intrinsic absorbing column density @xmath163@xmath36 ( see  [ sec : nucleus ] and g08 ) , are typical to what is observed in powerful narrow line radio galaxies , i.e. classical doubles with narrow ionization lines ; ( iii ) the position of 3c  353 in the host ( optical ) luminosity  radio luminosity domain is consistent with classifying 3c  353 as an fr  ii source ( swain et al . 1998 ) ; ( iv ) the detection of inverse - compton x - rays from the lobes of 3c  353 is consistent with what is typically seen in other classical doubles ( see  [ sec : lobe ] and g08 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that 3c  353 should be considered as representative of the class of powerful jet sources , including both radio - loud quasars and fr  ii radio galaxies .",
    "although the constructed three - band x - ray spectra for the jet knots (  [ sec : jet - spectra ] ) are consistent with power - law emission , a thermal origin of the detected x - ray features can not be ruled out by means of spectral analysis , because of the limited photon statistics .",
    "in fact , one can fit the x - ray data for these knots with a thermal model ( bremsstrahlung radiation ) , although the derived gas temperature is not well constrained .",
    "we therefore begin this section by checking whether the global parameters implied by a thermal interpretation are realistic .",
    "the bolometric bremsstrahlung luminosity of a hypothetical source with volume @xmath164 and number densities of electrons and ions @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , assumed to be characterized by a single temperature @xmath167 , is @xmath168 where all the quantities are expressed in cgs units ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath169kev ( which is close to the temperature of the zw  1718.1 - 0108 cluster ; iwasawa et al . 2000 ; g08 ) , and consider a completely ionized thermal hydrogen plasma ( @xmath170 ) uniformly distributed within the spherical volume @xmath171 of the radius @xmath172kpc ( as appropriate for , e.g. , the w47 knot ; see table  [ tab : spectra ] ) , then we find @xmath173ergs@xmath23 .",
    "the observed @xmath174kev luminosity of the w47 knot is @xmath175ergs@xmath23 .",
    "this , in the framework of the thermal model , would imply a number density of the thermal gas @xmath176@xmath177 , which is much higher than what is expected for the thermal gas density at the edge of the cluster .",
    "in addition , the corresponding thermal pressure of the hypothetical x - ray emitting cloud , @xmath178erg@xmath177 , would be about two orders of magnitude higher than the non - thermal pressure of the lobe , @xmath179erg@xmath177 , as estimated below .",
    "the presence of such a highly overpressured dense cloud of a hot gas , with a total mass of @xmath180 , within the lobes of a powerful radio galaxy and close to the radio jet , seems highly unlikely .",
    "we also emphasize that a clear discontinuity in the polarization properties of the jet , due to the rotation measure associated with the cloud ( @xmath181radm@xmath182 @xmath183radm@xmath182 , for an expected magnetic field component parallel to the line of sight within the cloud @xmath184@xmath185 g ) , although not large , should have been observable in the detailed analysis of the radio polarization maps presented by swain ( 1996 ) and swain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but was not seen .",
    "finally , we note that decreasing the assumed gas temperature ( in order to reduce the pressure of the postulated x - ray emitting cloud ) would cause the derived gas number density , the total mass of the cloud , and the rotation measures to increase still further .",
    "therefore , we rule out a thermal interpretation , and conclude that the x - ray emission of the jet - related knots detected by _",
    "chandra _ is non - thermal in origin .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : sed ] , the overall spectral energy distributions of different knots in 3c  353 are similar to each other , suggesting that _ the same _ physical process is responsible for production of the observed x - ray emission from the jet and the counterjet ; thus , in what follows , we attempt to find a single emission process that can explain all the observations .",
    "in addition , as we have noted above , the x - ray spectra of all the knots are inconsistent with simple extrapolations of the radio ( synchrotron ) continua .",
    "in this situation , as discussed in  [ sec : intro ] , the x - ray emission may be synchrotron emission from a second electron population , or it may be some form of inverse - compton emission . since the x - ray / radio morphology of the 3c  353 jet knots , discussed in more detail in the next sections ( in particular , the large positional offsets between the x - ray and radio intensity maxima , as well as the differences in the x - ray and radio jet widths ) , exclude any significant contribution of the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) process to the observed x - ray radiative output , we do not consider the ssc process further .",
    "instead we focus our examination of inverse - compton processes on the ic / cmb model (  [ sec : intro ] ) . in core - dominated quasars , the spectral behavior seen in the jet and counterjet knots of 3c  353",
    "is often believed to be a manifestation of the ic / cmb component dominating the observed x - ray emission , with corresponding high bulk lorentz factors ( sambruna et al .",
    "2004 , marshall et al .",
    "we will argue below that this can not be the case in 3c  353 , which substantially weakens the case for adopting the model in analogous fr",
    "ii / quasar jet sources .",
    "we begin by briefly discussing the global energetics of the 3c  353 jets , by utilizing our _ chandra _ detection of the non - thermal x - ray emission from the east radio lobe ( see  [ sec : lobe ] and elobe in table 1 ) , which is consistent with what was derived from the _ xmm - newton _ data ( g08 ) .",
    "first , we measure the radio fluxes of the east lobe taking the same extraction region as for the _ chandra_/_xmm - newton _ flux measurements , obtaining @xmath186jy , @xmath187jy , @xmath188jy , and @xmath189jy , respectively for @xmath142mhz , @xmath13ghz , @xmath135ghz , and @xmath20ghz radio maps .",
    "this corresponds to a radio spectral index of @xmath190 . assuming a spherical volume with a radius @xmath191kpc ( corresponding to @xmath192",
    "; see  [ sec : lobe ] ) , the equipartition magnetic field strengths for the east lobe is @xmath193@xmath185 g ( e.g. , kataoka & stawarz 2005 ) , and the minimum electron lorentz factor @xmath194 . ] . by assuming that all the lobe x - ray emission is due to inverse - comptonization of the cosmic microwave background photons , the measured flux densities imply a magnetic field strength @xmath195@xmath185 g .",
    "therefore , the equipartition magnetic field intensity exceeds the value measured for the east lobe by a factor @xmath322 .",
    "this result is indeed in a very good agreement to what is observed in other fr  ii sources ( see croston et al .",
    "2005 , kataoka & stawarz 2005 , and references therein ) and consistent with what was measured by g08 .",
    "assuming further equal energies stored in the non - thermal electrons and protons , the total energy density of the 3c  353 lobes is @xmath196erg@xmath177 .",
    "the total volume of the lobes is @xmath197@xmath198 .",
    "this gives a total energy @xmath199erg , which is in fact a lower limit only .",
    "finally , we estimate the radio source lifetime to be @xmath200yrs , which corresponds to the observed jet length @xmath201 and the assumed advance velocity of the jet termination region @xmath202 , as appropriate for a typical fr  ii radio galaxy ( see , e.g. , machalski et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this constrains the jet kinetic power in the 3c  353 radio galaxy to be @xmath203ergs@xmath23 .",
    "the above order - of - magnitude calculations allow us to estimate the jet magnetic field , @xmath204 , by minimizing the total kinetic luminosity of the 3c  353 jets , @xmath205 ( the sum of the kinetic powers carried by the jet protons , electrons , and the magnetic field , respectively ) , for a given jet synchrotron emission ( ghisellini & celotti 2001 ) .",
    "in particular , with @xmath206 , where @xmath207kpc is the jet radius ( swain et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath208 is the jet bulk lorentz factor , and @xmath209 is the comoving energy density of the jet magnetic field , one obtains @xmath210 which is very close to the standard equipartition value ( swain 1996 ) . from this , one may find the observer - frame ratio of the ic / cmb and synchrotron luminosities as @xmath211 here , @xmath212erg@xmath177 is the jet comoving energy density of the cmb radiation , @xmath213erg@xmath177 ( see equation [ eq : b ] ) , and @xmath214^{-1}$ ] is the jet doppler factor .    based on their models of the jet total intensity and polarization profiles , swain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) constrained the jet inclination to the line of sight in 3c  353 to be @xmath215 ; these large angles to the line of sight are strongly supported by the observed two - sidedness of both the radio and x - ray jets .",
    "accordingly , we can approximately substitute @xmath216 in equation [ eq : ratio ] , obtaining the observed luminosity ratio @xmath217 independently of the jet kinematic factors .",
    "the resulting value , @xmath218 , is in strong disagreement with the observed x - ray - to - radio luminosity ratio @xmath219 ( see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "note , that in the framework of the ic / cmb model with large jet inclinations such that @xmath220 , the electrons producing inverse - compton emission at the observed kev photon energies have lorentz factors @xmath221 , i.e. , almost exactly the same as the electrons producing synchrotron photons at the observed ghz frequencies , @xmath222 , so one can write @xmath223 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the ic / cmb model can not explain the observed x - ray emission of the 3c  353 jets , unless very large departures from energy equipartition , @xmath224@xmath185 g , are invoked .",
    "such large deviations from the minimum power condition are not expected in the case of large - scale extragalactic jets ( see in this context stawarz et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) and they would imply very high total energy densities in the jet .    the only possibility left is therefore that the observed x - ray emission of 3c  353 results from the synchrotron radiation of some flat - spectrum high - energy electron population , most likely separate to the one producing the observed radio emission .",
    "the required lorentz factors of the electrons emitting synchrotron photons with the observed kev energies are @xmath225 ( assuming the scaling of the magnetic field as given in equation 2 above and , again , @xmath226 ) .",
    "it has already been shown that stochastic acceleration processes taking place in large - scale extragalactic outflows may easily account for the production of electrons with these lorentz factors ( stawarz & ostrowski 2002 , uchiyama et al . 2006 ) and they are already invoked to explain observations of the hotspots of fr  ii sources and the jets of fr  is (  [ sec : intro ] ) . in the following section , by discussing in detail the x - ray / radio morphology of the 3c  353 jets",
    ", we aim to constrain several other aspects of the synchrotron scenario .      before discussing in more details the radio / x - ray morphology of the 3c  353 jets ,",
    "it is useful to summarize the main results of the extensive radio studies carried out on this source by swain ( 1996 ) and swain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . by means of detailed modeling of the intensity and polarization properties of the jets in 3c  353",
    ", these authors concluded that :    * most of the observed radio emission from the jet ( as well as from the counterjet ) , is produced within the outer sheath of the outflow / jet boundary layer with a velocity shear ; the contribution from the central jet spine is negligible ; * the magnetic field within the jet boundary layer has no radial component , @xmath227 , but only random axial and toroidal components in equipartition , @xmath228 , both ordered by a velocity shear ; the axial component of the magnetic field within the jet spine is negligible ; * the outer sheath and the jet spine have constant half - opening angle @xmath229 all along the outflow , such that the radius of the spine is roughly half of the total jet radius @xmath230kpc ; * jet models with ordered large - scale magnetic field ( helical structure , transverse flux ropes , etc . ) can not account for the observed flat - topped synchrotron intensity profiles across the jets and , at the same time , for the symmetric polarization profiles with measured degree of linear polarization @xmath231 .      as described in ",
    "[ sec : jetwidth ] of this paper , we have found that the x - ray _ knots _ in 3c  353 are possibly narrower than their radio counterparts ( which are also situated further away from the active nucleus ) .",
    "this agrees with what is observed in powerful quasar jets detected by _",
    "chandra _ : the limits to the width of the ( transversely unresolved ) x - ray knots in these systems are always slightly smaller than the measured sizes in the radio band , and sometimes even in the optical band ( jester et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) . in the framework of the ic / cmb model involving significant beaming",
    ", one would argue that since the comoving energy density of the cmb photons is proportional to the square of the bulk lorentz factor of the emitting plasma , @xmath232 , the comoving ic / cmb emissivity of the slower jet boundary layer should be much smaller than the analogous emissivity of a fast jet spine , resulting in the x - ray jet being narrower than its radio / optical counterpart ( for a fixed magnetic field energy density @xmath233 throughout the outflow ) .",
    "however , as discussed in the previous section , the detection of the x - ray counter - knot in 3c  353 and the established large inclination of this source exclude the ic / cmb model : only the synchrotron model is viable to explain these features .",
    "thus , the observations imply that the presence of high - energy electrons producing the observed synchrotron x - ray jet emission must be restricted to the central spine of the jet rather than to the jet boundary layer , _ at least in the upstream portions of the bright knots _ , if our findings regarding the widths of the x - ray jet features are correct .",
    "we speculate that such a difference may be due to the different configurations of the small - scale magnetic field within different parts of the radially stratified outflow , as discussed by swain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that with the current data the signal - to - noise ratio of the _ chandra _ x - ray maps of 3c  353 is rather poor , and therefore all conclusions regarding the width of the x - ray jets in this object , or rather of the isolated jet knots , should be taken with extreme caution . also , we emphasize that the multiwavelength structures and spectra of bright knots in other well - studied jet sources ( 3c  273 , centaurus  a ) do not necessarily correspond directly to the multiwavelength morphology and spectral properties of the interknot regions ( marshall et al .",
    "2005b , kataoka et al .",
    "2006 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2007b ) , but that it is the interknot regions ( rather than the bright knots ) that reflect closely the global , possibly stratified morphology of the outflow .",
    "finally , the poorly known internal structure of the boundary layer in relativistic jets may be much more complicated than what is typically assumed , resulting in several non - intuitive radiative properties of the jet plasma ( see in this context aloy & mimica 2008 ) .      in the case of the jets in 3c  353",
    ", we observe a systematic decrease of the @xmath234 ratio along the outflow ( see  [ sec : jet - spectra ] and figure [ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed in many ( though not all ) quasar jets detected by _ chandra _",
    "( e.g. , sambruna et al .",
    "2004 , marshall et al . 2005a , hardcastle 2006 , siemiginowska et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the framework of the ic / cmb model for the x - ray jet emission",
    ", it has been suggested that this behavior results from a smooth deceleration of the outflows on kpc - mpc scales due to gradual mass entrainment ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2004 , tavecchio et al .",
    "as pointed out by hardcastle ( 2006 ) , this idea faces several difficulties in explaining the multiwavelength morphology of powerful jets , and here we briefly summarize the arguments given : ( i ) no trend for the gradual bulk deceleration is observed in large - scale radio jets of fr  ii sources , but if only the jet spine is to be decelerated , the model should explain why the jet boundaries do not respond to the involved dramatic changes in the jet / spine kinematics ; ( ii ) the amount of cold matter required to be entrained , and thus to decelerate powerful quasar jets , is in some cases too high when compared to the upper limits on the masses of the surrounding thermal gas .",
    "as discussed previously , the ic / cmb model is excluded in the case of 3c  353 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the previous subsection we have argued that the x - ray morphology implies that the synchrotron x - ray emission is associated with the faster jet spine rather than with the slower jet boundaries .",
    "could the observed systematic decrease of the @xmath235 flux ratio therefore nevertheless be connected with a smooth jet / spine deceleration ?",
    "it is important to remark again in this context that the jets in 3c  353 are extremely well collimated all over their lengths , with a constant half - opening angle @xmath236 , and constant jet / counterjet brightness asymmetry ratio @xmath237 .",
    "this is in agreement with what is observed in other fr  iis : no evidence for gradual jet deceleration is provided by the jet radio morphology ( hardcastle 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by swain et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the fact that the boundary layer seems to be always restricted to the same parts of the outflow @xmath238 ( i.e. , that the boundary shear layer does not spread / expand toward the jet axis ) , coupled with the constancy of the observed level of linear polarization along the jets and the absence of radial component of the magnetic field , indicate that no large - scale turbulent eddies associated with mass entrainment are present in the 3c  353 jets .",
    "since it is the jet boundary shear layer which mediates interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium , the absence of changes in the shear layer implies that there is no reason for the jet spine to decelerate .",
    "thus , we must conclude that systematic mass entrainment on scales of tens of kpc is unlikely to be of any importance , at least in 3c  353 .",
    "the only remaining possibility is thus that the particle acceleration conditions associated with microphysical plasma parameters  rather than with the global hydrodynamical configuration of the outflow  change within the central parts of the jets . because those regions of the jet dominate the jet radiative output at x - ray frequencies but produce negligible radio emission when compared to the jet boundaries , the ratio of the observed x - ray and radio fluxes decreases systematically along the jet in 3c  353 and in other analogous systems .",
    "we might for example speculate that a gradually decaying chaotic component of the magnetic field in the jet spine leads to a lower efficiency in the acceleration ( due to , e.g. , magnetic reconnection processes ) of the highest - energy electrons .      the apparent positional offsets between the intensity maxima of the x - ray and radio knots , as reported in this paper for 3c  353 , are observed in several other jet sources detected by _",

    "( 2003 ) , they can not be explained by simple models involving particle acceleration at a single extended shock front , which just exploit the difference between the cooling timescales for the electrons emitting synchrotron x - ray and radio photons ( bai & lee 2003 ) . in a wider context , the problem of such offsets relates directly to the question on the nature of the jet knots : are they separate moving portions of the jet matter , or rather stationary features produced by , e.g. , reconfinement shocks ? we note that formation of reconfinement shocks in relativistic outflows has recently been widely discussed in the context of the inner ( @xmath239kpc ) jets of @xmath240-ray emitting blazars and radio galaxies ( e.g. , jorstad et al . 2001 , cheung et al .",

    "chandra _ , among other observed jet properties , has led several authors to conclude that knots are instead separate moving portions of the jet with excess kinetic power , produced by intermittent or modulated activity of the central engine ( bridle et al .",

    "in addition , the reconfinement shock scenario does not predict in a natural way the frequency - dependent position of the intensity maxima of the radiating plasma .",
    "clearly , this problem can not be addressed fully in our qualitative discussion , since detailed numerical simulations are needed to understand the complex structure of the reconfinement shocks in large - scale mildly - relativistic outflows .",
    "however , we believe that a more likely explanation for the observed x - ray / radio positional offsets can be given in the framework of the model in which knots are moving portions of the jet matter . for example , one may propose that portions of the jet produced by the central engine during a more active period , and hence characterized by excess kinetic power and/or higher bulk velocity , propagate within the ` stationary ' ( slower ) outflow corresponding to the quasi - quiescent state of the active nucleus .",
    "since the bulk velocities of the jet plasma are expected to be supersonic ( although not necessarily ultrarelativistic ) , a double - shock structure is expected to form , due to collisions of the faster portions of the jet matter with the slower outflow .",
    "let us consider a model in which the forward shock propagating in the slower outflow ( and thus characterized by a highly oblique geometry at the jet boundaries ) is responsible for the brightening of the outer portions of the jet at radio frequencies ( due to compression of the jet magnetic field , driving the turbulence , etc . ) , while the reverse shock propagating within the faster portion of the jet is associated with the intensity maximum of the synchrotron x - ray emission . in this case",

    "several features of the observations are not explained by this scenario ; for example , ( i ) there is no obvious reason why the forward and reverse fronts of the double shock structure should work substantially differently with respect to the acceleration of ultrarelativistic electrons ; and ( ii ) it is not clear why similar positional offsets are observed in the jet knots and in the jet termination regions ( hotspots ) , since the shock structures produced in the latter regions are expected to be completely different .",
    "these may suggest that the toy model considered above is over - simplified , and that some other physical picture has to be considered .",
    "another possibility  still in the framework of intermittent jet activity  is that the central engine ejects _ heavy _ knots in @xmath263yr - long flare - like activity periods . due to the high ( relativistic ) mass load of the knot",
    ", the bulk velocity of one of these heavier portions of magnetized plasma is expected to be smaller than the velocity of the ` weak jet ' formed in an epoch of quiescence .",
    "interactions between the heavy / slower and light / faster portions of the jet would lead to formation of a single ( reverse ) shock at the upstream edge of a heavy knot ( the forward shock , propagating within the heavy portion of the jet matter , would be expected to die away soon after its formation , as long as the density ratio between the two phases of the ejecta was high ) .",
    "thus , the heavy portion of the jet outflow would behave like the reflecting walls used in ` particle - in - cell ' simulations and would form a shock front that would propagate upstream . as a result",
    ", the positions of radio knots would coincide with the positions of heavy portions of the jet plasma , while the x - ray intensity maxima due to freshly accelerated electrons would be expected to coincide with the downstream region of the reverse shock .",
    "this model solves at least problem ( i ) noted above ; however , discussions based on more sophisticated numerical simulations are clearly essential to confirm this or other similar speculations .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the data for the powerful fr  ii radio galaxy 3c  353 obtained with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory . in a deep , @xmath2ks _ chandra _ observation , we have detected the x - ray emission from most of the radio structures in this source , including the nucleus , isolated knots in the jet and the counterjet , the terminal jet regions ( hotspots ) , and one radio lobe .",
    "our major findings are as follows :    1 .   non - thermal x - ray emission associated with a knot in the counterjet of a powerful fr",
    "ii source has been detected for the first time .",
    "this detection , in agreement with the established large inclination of 3c  353 , strongly disagrees with the inverse - compton model proposed in the literature , and points to a synchrotron origin for the x - ray jet photons . 2 .",
    "we find that the width of the x - ray knots is narrower ( @xmath86 effect ) than that measured at radio wavelengths , suggesting that the production of the x - ray emission is associated with the central jet spine rather than with the jet boundaries .",
    "this conclusion , however , must be confirmed with x - ray data with a much better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the radio - to - x - ray flux ratio decreases systematically downstream along the outflows , as is often observed in other extragalactic sources .",
    "we argue that this is due to the fact that the particle acceleration conditions associated with microphysical plasma parameters changes within the central part of the jet , rather than being due to a gradual decrease of the jet bulk velocity resulting from a smooth jet deceleration .",
    "substantial ( kpc - scale ) offsets between positions of the x - ray and radio intensity maxima within each knot are found , with the magnitude of the offsets increasing away from the nucleus .",
    "we have speculated that these offsets can be explained if radio knots are moving portions of jet material which are produced by the central engine during an epoch of enhanced activity .",
    "depending on the velocity and density ratio between these knots and the outflow produced at times of quiescence , a complex double - shock structure may form as a result of the interaction between the two phases of the ejecta , with the reverse shock ( propagating within the faster portion of the jet ) being associated with the peak of the x - ray emission .",
    "although we can not provide definitive solutions or interpretations for each problem , we argue that the 3c  353 data strongly suggest that the synchrotron x - ray emission of extragalactic large - scale jets is not simply shaped by the global hydrodynamical configuration of the outflows , but is also very sensitive to the microphysical parameters of the jet plasma .",
