    "let us also note that although in this paper we have in mind the application of the ( wa ) in underwater acoustics examples , our analytical and numerical methods can also be applied to wide - angle seismic wave , @xcite , and aeroacoustic @xcite wave propagation .",

    "we would like to stress that the convergence analysis of the proposed finite difference scheme is not a repetition of the corresponding analysis for the flat bottom case ( cf .",

    "this is due to the fact that the differential operator is third order with respect to @xmath71 , which leads to a truncation error of @xmath72 at the nodes adjacent to the endpoints of @xmath68 .",

    "in section 5 , we verify the accuracy and stability of the finite difference scheme by means of numerical experiments and apply it to solve an underwater acoustics problem in a downsloping benchmark domain comparing the results with those obtained from the model proposed in @xcite .",
    "for rigorous error estimates on other finite difference and finite element methods for the pe and wa equation on domains with horizontal or variable bottom we refer the reader e.g. to the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and their references .",
