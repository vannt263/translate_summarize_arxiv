    "for a nonnegative integer @xmath0 , stirling s formula @xmath1 where @xmath2 is euler s number , yields an approximation of the central binomial coefficient @xmath3 ( assuming that @xmath0 is even ) using @xmath4 as @xmath5 where we write @xmath6 as a short - hand for @xmath7 . in the current note , we derive an asymptotic formula for the central _ multinomial triangle _ or , _ polynomial _ , _ coefficient _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , where multinomial triangles are a generalization of binomial triangles , where entries in row @xmath8 are defined as coefficients of the polynomial @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "our derivation is not based upon asymptotics of factorials but upon the limiting distribution of the sum of discrete uniform random variables . or @xmath11 are even .",
    "if this is not the case , replace respective quantities , e.g. @xmath12 , with their floor , @xmath13 . ]",
    "polynomial coefficients are important , for example , because they denote the number of _ integer compositions _ of the nonnegative integer @xmath14 with parts in the set @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , are nonnegative integers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , i.e. the number of possibilities to write @xmath14 as a sum of integers @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , for @xmath20 .",
    "in generalization to binomial triangles , @xmath21-nomial triangles , @xmath10 , are defined in the following way . starting with a @xmath22 in row zero ,",
    "construct an entry in row @xmath8 , @xmath23 , by adding the overlying @xmath21 entries in row @xmath24 ( some of these entries are taken as zero if not defined ) ; thereby , row @xmath8 has @xmath25 entries .",
    "for example , the monomial ( @xmath26 ) , binomial ( @xmath27 ) , trinomial ( @xmath28 ) and quadrinomial triangles ( @xmath29 ) start as follows ,    [ cols= \" > \" , ]     in the @xmath21-nomial triangle , entry @xmath14 , @xmath30 , in row @xmath8 , which we denote by @xmath31 , has the following interpretation .",
    "it is the coefficient of @xmath32 in the expansion of @xmath33 in recent work , eger @xcite has shown that @xmath31 denotes the number of integer compositions of the nonnegative integer @xmath14 with @xmath8 parts @xmath18 , each from the set @xmath34 , and allows the following representation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a _ multinomial coefficient _ , defined as @xmath37 , for nonnegative integers @xmath38 .",
    "we can easily verify representation by noting that for real numbers @xmath39 , it holds that ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath40 then setting @xmath41 for @xmath42 , @xmath43 and comparing coefficients of the right - hand sides of and leads to .",
    "our strategy for deriving approximation formulae for polynomial coefficients is as follows .",
    "first , we determine the asymptotic distribution of the sum of discrete uniform variables , which we easily find to be a normal distribution by the central limit theorem ( clt ) .",
    "then we determine the exact distribution , which turns out to yield the normalized polynomial coefficients @xmath44 .",
    "this distribution has recently been found by caiado and rathie @xcite using characteristic functions , residue theory and cauchy s theorem , but we give an elementary two - line proof that almost requires no effort at all . by relating the asymptotic distribution to the exact distribution , we obtain a multinomial analogue of stirling s approximation to the central binomial coefficient .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive integer and let @xmath11 be a nonnegative integer .",
    "let @xmath45 , @xmath46 , be identically and independently distributed random draws from the discrete uniform distribution on the set @xmath47 , and let @xmath48 be their sum , @xmath49 obviously , the mean and variance of @xmath48 are given by @xmath50 = m\\operatorname{e}[s_j ] = \\frac{ml}{2},\\quad\\quad\\sigma^2_{m , l}:=\\operatorname{var}[s^{(m ) } ] = m\\operatorname{var}[s_j ] =    m\\frac{(l+1)^2 - 1}{12},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by standard moments of the uniform distribution .",
    "moreover , by the clt @xmath51 so that for large @xmath0 , @xmath48 is approximately normally distributed with mean @xmath12 and variance @xmath52 .    however , we can also exactly determine the probability that @xmath48 takes on the integer value @xmath14 , for @xmath53 . for this purpose , interpret all @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as independently and identically _ multinomially _ distributed with probabilities @xmath54 of ` events ' @xmath55 to @xmath11 occurring , i.e. each @xmath45 is vector - valued , @xmath56 , with @xmath57=\\frac{1}{l+1}$ ] for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 denotes the number of times event @xmath8 occurs , for @xmath61 .",
    "hence , the sum @xmath48 is multinomially distributed with probability mass function@xmath62=p[a_0=a_0,\\dotsc , a_l = a_l ] =    \\binom{m}{a_0,\\dotsc , a_l}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{l+1}\\bigr)^m , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 . then , if @xmath64 for nonnegative integers @xmath65 with @xmath63 , @xmath48 ` represents ' the integer @xmath66 .",
    "thus , for @xmath14 such that @xmath53 , we obviously have , reinterpreting @xmath48 as scalar - valued , @xmath67 = \\sum_{\\overset{a_0+\\dotsc+a_l = m}{0\\cdot        a_0+\\dotsc+l\\cdot        a_l = n}}p[s^{(m)}=(a_0,\\dotsc , a_l)]=\\bigl(\\frac{1}{l+1}\\bigr)^m\\sum_{\\overset{a_0+\\dotsc , a_l = m}{0\\cdot        a_0+\\dotsc+l\\cdot        a_l = n}}\\binom{m}{a_0,\\dotsc , a_l}=\\bigl(\\frac{1}{l+1}\\bigr)^m\\binom{m}{n}_{l+1}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      from our above derivations , we know that the normalized random variable @xmath48 converges in distribution to a normally distributed random variable , which precisely means that the distribution function of @xmath48 converges pointwise to the distribution function of the corresponding normally distributed random variable .",
    "let @xmath53 and consider @xmath67 = p[s^{(m)}\\le n]-p[s^{(m)}\\le n-1 ] . \\ ] ] by convergence of distribution functions , we hence know that , for large @xmath0 , @xmath68 \\approx p[n-1\\le x\\le n ] \\approx p[n-1/2\\le x\\le n+1/2],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 has a normal distribution with the same mean and variance as @xmath48 , and applying a continuity correction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . rewriting the right hand side of in terms of the standard normal variable @xmath70",
    ", we thus obtain for @xmath71 , @xmath72 \\approx p[-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m , l}}\\le z\\le      + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m , l } } ] = \\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m , l}}\\right)-\\phi\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_{m , l}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the standard normal cumulative distribution function .",
    "geometrically , @xmath74 denotes the area under the normal curve @xmath75 from @xmath76 to @xmath77 . for large @xmath0 , this area can be approximated by the area of the rectangle with width @xmath78 and height @xmath79 , that is , @xmath72",
    "\\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi        m\\frac{(l+1)^2 - 1}{12}}}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the expression for @xmath80 $ ] from above , we hence have @xmath81 for @xmath27 , pascal s case , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath82 , we therefore have the approximations @xmath83    $ ] for @xmath84 for @xmath82 fixed ; and normal approximations.,title=\"fig : \" ] $ ] for @xmath84 for @xmath82 fixed ; and normal approximations.,title=\"fig : \" ] $ ] for @xmath84 for @xmath82 fixed ; and normal approximations.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ figure : plots1 ]      these plots suggest to more generally consider a pointwise approximation of @xmath80 $ ] , for @xmath53 , by the value @xmath85 of the density of the corresponding normally distributed random variable @xmath69 , leading to the following approximation formulae for polynomial coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath86 how well are these ` normal approximations ' @xmath87 of @xmath88 for various values of @xmath14 for finite @xmath0 ? in figure [ figure : plots ] , we depict the relative error @xmath89 for all values of @xmath14 between @xmath55 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the relative error becomes very low for @xmath14 ` around ' @xmath12 and increases symmetrically as @xmath14 approaches the boundary values @xmath55 and @xmath90 . in the same figure",
