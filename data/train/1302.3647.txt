    "this paper is devoted to a study of families of equilibrium measures on the real line in the polynomial external fields .",
    "we consider these measures as functions of a parameter @xmath0 representing either the total mass , time or temperature .",
    "these families are regarded as models of many physical processes , which motivates their intense study in the context of the mathematical physics .",
    "but equilibrium problems for the logarithmic potential play an important role also in analysis and approximation theory ; in particular , they provide a general method used in the theory of orthogonal polynomials . in this sense ,",
    "the subject is essentially `` bilingual '' and has so many ramifications that we opted for writing an extended introduction , instead of a dull enumeration of our results .",
    "one of our main goals is a formal investigation of the dependence of the key parameters of the equilibrium measure from the parameter @xmath0 , and in particular , their singularities as functions of @xmath0 . in thermodynamical terms , these singularities are closely related to phase transitions , and we start the introduction with the discussion of this problem in the context of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . it does not mean that we actually intend to interpret our results in any nonstandard way .",
    "we want , on the contrary , to make a short review of a few existing standard interpretations , which could be helpful during `` translations '' in our bilingual area .    then we formally introduce basic facts related to the equilibrium measure and mention briefly some applications in analysis and approximation theory , returning at the end to the topic of the coulomb gas and random matrices .    in the course of these discussions we describe in general terms the main results of the paper and its structure .",
    "determinantal random point processes ( or self - avoiding point fields ) are pervasive in statistical mechanics , probability theory , combinatorics , and many other branches of mathematics @xcite . among the examples of such processes we can mention 2-d fermionic systems or coulomb gases , plancherel measures on partitions , two - dimensional random growth models , random non - intersecting paths , totally - asymetric exclusion processes ( tasep ) , quantum hall models , and random matrix models , to mention a few .",
    "many of these models lead to the so - called _ orthogonal polynomial ensembles _",
    "@xcite , an important subclass of determinantal random point processes .",
    "the large scale behavior of such ensembles is described in terms of the asymptotics of the underlying family of orthogonal polynomials , and in the last instance , by the related equilibrium measure solving an extremal problem from the potential theory .",
    "one of the earliest and probably best known examples of orthogonal polynomial ensembles is the joint distribution of the eigenvalues of a random @xmath1 hermitian matrix drawn from a unitary ensemble ( see @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , we endow the set of @xmath1 hermitian matrices @xmath2 with the joint probability distribution @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a given function with enough increase at @xmath5 to guarantee the convergence of the integral in the definition of the normalizing constant @xmath6 then @xmath7 induces a ( joint ) probability distribution @xmath8 on the eigenvalues @xmath9 of these matrices , with the density @xmath10 and with the corresponding _ partition function _ @xmath11 this result can be traced back to a classical theorem by h.  weyl , see @xcite and also @xcite . notice that @xmath7 is invariant under unitary transformations of the hermitian matrices , while measure @xmath8 defines the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a dyson gas of @xmath12 particles with positions @xmath13 on @xmath14 in the potential @xmath15 , where they interact by the repulsive electrostatic potential of the plane ( the logarithmic potential ) . on the other hand , is also the joint probability density function of an @xmath12-point orthogonal polynomial ensemble with weight @xmath16 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "free energy _ of this matrix model is defined as @xmath17 regardless its interpretation , a particularly important problem is to analyze its asymptotic behavior in the thermodynamic limit , i.e.  as @xmath18 .    a rather straightforward fact , the existence of the limit @xmath19 ( infinite volume free energy ) has been established under very general conditions on @xmath15 , see e.g.  @xcite and section [ subsect : equilibrium_analytic ] below . an important property of the infinite volume free energy @xmath20 is its analyticity with respect to the parameters of the problem .",
    "the values of the parameters at which the free energy is not analytic are the _ critical points _ ; curves of discontinuity of some derivatives of the free energy connecting the critical points divide the parameter space into different phases of the model . thus , critical points are points of phase transition , and they are going to be a center of our case study .",
    "the observation that the distribution can be regarded as the gibbs ensemble on the weyl chamber @xmath21 with hamiltonian @xmath22 allows to foretell the fundamental fact that the value of @xmath20 is given by the solution of a minimization problem for the weighted logarithmic energy .",
    "the corresponding minimizer is the _ equilibrium measure _ associated to the problem . ] .",
    "this measure , which is a one - dimensional distribution on @xmath14 , is also a model for the limit distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath9 in .",
    "indeed , the multidimensional probability distribution @xmath8 is concentrated for large @xmath12 near a single point @xmath23 , which is actually the minimizer for the corresponding discrete energy of an @xmath12-point distribution . in other words , for large @xmath12 the measure @xmath8 is close to @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath18 , the discrete equilibrium measure converges to the continuous one , so that the thermodynamic limits are essentially described by the ( continuous ) equilibrium measures ( see section [ sec : equilibriuminanalysis ] ) .",
    "when @xmath15 is real - analytic , the support of such a measure ( or the asymptotic spectrum of the corresponding unitary ensemble ) is comprised of a finite number of disjoint intervals ( or `` cuts '' ) , and the number of these intervals is a fundamental parameter .",
    "for instance , the free energy @xmath25 has a full asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath26 ( `` topological large @xmath12 expansion '' ) if and only if this support is a single interval ; otherwise , oscillatory terms are present ( this was observed in @xcite , and studied systematically in @xcite ) .",
    "the particularly interesting phenomena occur precisely in the neighborhood of the values of the parameters at which the number of the connected components of the support of the equilibrium measure changes .",
    "any change in the number of cuts is a phase transition in the sense specified above , but there are also phase transitions of other kinds ( not related to a change in the number of cuts ) : see sections [ subsec : classification ] and [ sec : phasetrans ] for details .",
    "we specialize our analysis to the polynomial potential .",
    "it is convenient to write @xmath15 in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a polynomial of an even degree and positive leading coefficient .",
    "this case is of great interest , see e.g.  @xcite , to cite a few references .",
    "a common situation is when @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath30 although the coefficients of @xmath28 ( `` coupling constants '' of the model ) play a role of the variables in the problem , the parameter @xmath31 stands clearly out , as it was already mentioned above .",
    "recall that it can be regarded either as a temperature ( from the point of view of statistical mechanics ) or time ( from the perspective of a dynamical system ) , and will correspond to the total mass of the equilibrium measure in the external field @xmath28 on @xmath14 .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is the description of the evolution of the limiting spectrum of the unitary ensemble for  as time ( temperature ) @xmath0 grows from zero to infinity , paying special attention to the mechanisms underlying the increase ( `` birth of a cut '' ) and decrease ( `` fusion of two cuts '' or `` closure of a gap '' ) in the number of its connected components .",
    "equivalently , we study one - parametric families of equilibrium measures on @xmath14 in a polynomial external field with the total mass @xmath0 of the measure as the parameter .",
    "this problem has been addressed in several publications before , here we only mention a few of them .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the fusion of two cuts for the quartic potential @xmath28 , proving the phase transition of the third order for the free energy ( in other words , that @xmath32 ) .",
    "this work found continuation in @xcite , where in particular the birth of the cut in the same model was observed ( but not proved rigorously ) .",
    "it turns out actually that the third order phase transition of the infinite volume free energy is inherent to all possible transitions existing in this model .",
    "the evolution of the support of the equilibrium measure in terms of the parameters of the polynomial potential has been studied also in @xcite , where a connection with some pde s and integrable systems have been exploited .    however , despite of this intense activity , the picture is not complete ; even the monographic chapter @xcite contains imprecisions .",
    "open questions exist actually for the first non - trivial case of a quartic field , and this paper adds a number of new details to this particular picture ; some of them seem to be significant .",
    "for instance , we present a simple characterization of the case when the equilibrium measure has one cut _ for all _ values of the parameter @xmath31 , or when a singularity of type iii ( see the definition in section [ sec : revisited ] ) can occur",
    ". we also study in more detail the system of differential equations governing the dynamics of the endpoints of the support of the equilibrium measure .",
    "in particular , we analyze the behavior of the infinite volume free energy and of other magnitudes of the system near the singular points , revealing some interesting universal properties .    finally , but not less important",
    ", we show that all the known and new results related to the outlined problem can be systematically derived from two basic facts in the potential theory .",
    "one of them is a representation for the cauchy transform of the equilibrium measure .",
    "this representation is a corollary of the fact that on the real line any equilibrium measure in an analytic field is a critical measure , which allows us to apply a variational technique presented in @xcite , and systematically in @xcite .",
    "another fact is a buyarov  rakhmanov differentiation formula @xcite for the equilibrium measure with respect to its total mass and some of its immediate consequences , which we complement with a unified treatment of the differentiation formulas with respect to any coupling constant , a result which to our knowledge is new .",
    "we provide further details in section [ sec : critical ] .      in this section",
    "we introduce basic notation and mention a number of fundamental facts on the equilibrium measures on the real line , necessary for the rest of the exposition . for more details the reader can consult the original papers @xcite and the monograph @xcite .    for a finite borel measure @xmath33 with compact support @xmath34 on the plane we can define its _ logarithmic potential _ @xmath35 and its _ logarithmic energy _ , @xmath36= -\\iint \\log |z - x|\\,d\\sigma ( x)d\\sigma ( z).\\ ] ]",
    "suppose further that a real - valued function @xmath28 , called the _ external field _",
    ", is defined on @xmath34 .",
    "then we introduce the _ total _ ( or `` chemical '' ) _ potential _",
    ", @xmath37 ( defined at least where @xmath28 is ) and the _ total energy _ , @xmath38= i [ \\sigma ] + 2\\int \\varphi(z ) \\ , dz,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "this definition makes sense for a very wide class of functions @xmath28 , although for the purpose of this paper it is sufficient to consider basically real - analytic , actually polynomial , external fields on the real axis . as usual ,",
    "we assume also that @xmath39 condition that is automatically satisfied for any real non - constant polynomial of even degree and positive leading coefficient . then for each @xmath31 there exists a unique measure @xmath40 with compact suport @xmath41 , minimizing the total energy @xmath42= \\min_{\\sigma \\in { { \\mathcal m}}_t } i_{\\varphi   } [ \\sigma]\\ ] ] in the class @xmath43 of positive borel measures @xmath33 compactly supported on @xmath14 and with total mass @xmath0 ( that is , @xmath44 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 is completely determined by the equilibrium condition satisfied by the total potential @xmath46 where the _ equilibrium _ or _ extremal constant _",
    "@xmath47 can be written as @xmath48-\\int \\varphi \\ , d\\lambda_t \\right).\\ ] ]    when @xmath49 is a compact set on @xmath14 and the external field @xmath28 is @xmath50 the corresponding energy minimizer @xmath51 in the class of all probability measures @xmath52 , denoted by @xmath53 , is known as the _ robin measure _ of @xmath49 , its energy is the _ robin constant _ of @xmath49 , @xmath54,\\ ] ] and the logarithmic capacity of @xmath49 is given by @xmath55 .",
    "measure @xmath53 is characterized by the the fact that @xmath56 together with the equilibrium condition @xmath57    for a general external field the main technical problem when finding the equilibrium measure is that its support is not known a priori and has to be found from the equilibrium conditions .",
    "once the support is determined , the measure itself can be recovered from the equations presented by the equality part in , which is an integral equation with the logarithmic kernel .",
    "after differentiation it is reduced to a singular integral equation with a cauchy kernel whose solution ( on reasonable sets ) has an explicit representation .",
    "hence , solving the support problem is the key , and it is essentially more difficult .    in the one cut case ,",
    "its endpoints are determined by relatively simple equations , but in general , straightforward solutions are not available . for a polynomial ( actually , real analytic ) field",
    "the support @xmath58 is a union of a finite number of intervals .",
    "equations may be written for the endpoints of those intervals ( and we better know the number of intervals in advance ) , but these equations are not easy to deal with .",
    "for instance , in the case of the polynomial field they may be interpreted as systems of equations on periods of an abelian differential on a hyperelliptic riemann surface ( see e.g.  remark [ remark : riemann ] ) , but such systems are usually far from being simple . in this context",
    ", our approach is based on the dynamics of the family @xmath58 .",
    "as we have mentioned above , one of our goals is to describe the dynamics of the family of supports @xmath58 as the mass @xmath0 ( which is also `` time '' , or according to @xcite , the `` temperature '' ) changes from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "the detailed discussion starts in sections [ sec : critical ] and [ sec : polyn ] below .",
    "observe finally that a study of the family @xmath61 with total mass @xmath0 as a parameter in a fixed external field @xmath28 may be reduced by a simple connecting formula to the family of unit equilibrium measures with respect to family of fields @xmath62 .",
    "we have @xmath63 in some cases such a reduction is reasonable , but more often it brings more problems than benefits .",
    "in particular , we believe that the total mass as a parameter has particular advantages in the problem under consideration .",
    "the significant progress in the theory of rational approximations of analytic functions ( pad - type approximants ) and in the related theory of orthogonal polynomials in the 1980 s is due in part to the logarithmic potential method ; see the original papers @xcite and the monographs @xcite , although the list is not complete . a novel important ingredient of the techniques developed during that period was precisely the introduction of the weighted equilibrium measure ( among other types of equilibria ) .",
    "for instance , a typical application of the notion of equilibrium measures for orthogonal polynomials is the following fundamental result from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , presented here in a simplified form : let @xmath28 be a continuous external field , @xmath64 , and let polynomial @xmath65 be defined by @xmath66 this polynomial is also characterized by the extremal property @xmath67 now , if @xmath29 in such a way that @xmath68 , then @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the weak-@xmath71 convergence . from the point of view of the spectral theory ,",
    "zeros of @xmath72 are eigenvalues of the truncated @xmath1 jacobi matrices associated with the weight @xmath73 , and shows that @xmath74 can be naturally interpreted as the limit spectrum of the infinite jacobi matrix , associated with the scaling @xmath75 . for details related to applications of equilibrium measures in spectral theory of discrete sturm - liouville operators",
    "see @xcite .    another large circle of applications of ( continuous ) equilibrium measures @xmath74 is related to the discrete analogue of this notion .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the set of all point mass measures on @xmath14 of total mass @xmath77 .",
    "the corresponding discrete energies are defined by @xmath78:=    \\sum_{i\\neq j } \\log\\frac{1}{|\\zeta_i-\\zeta_j| } , \\quad e_\\varphi[\\mu]:= e[\\mu]+2\\int \\varphi\\ , d\\mu\\ ] ] ( cf .  ) .",
    "let @xmath79 be a minimizer ( not necessarily unique ) for @xmath80 $ ] in the class @xmath81 ; points @xmath82 are also known as _ weighted fekete points_. we have @xmath83 \\longrightarrow i_\\varphi [ \\lambda_1 ] \\quad \\text{as } n\\to \\infty;\\ ] ] for the proof , see e.g.  @xcite , where some applications of fekete points in approximation theory are also discussed .",
    "furthermore , for a class of external fields @xmath28 , the polynomials @xmath84 satisfy a second order differential equation with polynomial coefficients and constitute an example of the so - called heine - stieltjes polynomials ; see @xcite for further details on the algebraic and analytic properties of these polynomials . as it was shown in @xcite , the limit zero distribution of such polynomials in the classical case studied by stieltjes @xcite",
    "is governed again by the ( continuous ) one - parametric family of equilibrium measures .",
    "also a related work worth mentioning is @xcite , where deformation with respect to the parameters of the external field were considered .",
    "let us return to the random models mentioned in the beginning of this introduction .",
    "an important fact , already mentioned there , is that the eigenvalue distribution of the unitary ensemble of random matrices may be equivalently written in terms of the discrete energy . indeed , since we deal only with symmetric functions of a vector @xmath85 , we may identify @xmath86 with the non - ordered collection @xmath87 of real points",
    ". this collection uniquely determines measure @xmath88 with @xmath89 by @xmath90 so that we can identify also @xmath91 and write @xmath92 instead of @xmath93 .",
    "now , we define @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "distribution @xmath96 coincides with @xmath97 in if we identify @xmath98 and use also connection . as observed before , is a canonical gibbs distribution for a dyson gas .    in this connection",
    ", the classical heine s formula @xmath99 represents the orthogonal polynomial @xmath72 with respect to the weight @xmath100 as the average of polynomials with random real zeros distributed according to @xmath101 .    in the last decade the distribution @xmath102 and its characteristics , such as the correlation function , has been intensively investigated in relation to the eigenvalue statistics of the unitary ensembles of hermitian matrices .",
    "one of the relevant features of @xmath102 in the asymptotic ( thermodynamic ) regime is that it exhibits non - trivial phase transitions or critical behavior , with universal properties that attract increasing attention .",
    "the existence of such phase transitions and their character has important physical interpretations , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium measure @xmath61 ( and consequently , the parameters upon which it depends ) is called _ regular _ ( see e.g.  @xcite ) if the following conditions hold : ( a ) @xmath61 is absolutely continuous on @xmath14 with respect to the lebesgue measure and @xmath103 does not vanish in the interior of @xmath58 ; ( b ) @xmath103 has a square root vanishing at the endpoints of the connected components of the support @xmath58 ; and ( c ) the inequality in is strict in @xmath104 .",
    "otherwise , the equilibrium measure is singular . following",
    "the terminology of @xcite , an equality in at a point in @xmath104 is a _ singularity of type i _",
    "( this is also known as `` birth of the cut '' , see below ) ; zeros of @xmath103 that lie in the interior of @xmath58 are called _ singular points of type ii _ ( corresponding to a closure of a gap ) , while the endpoints of the connected components of @xmath58 where @xmath103 has a higher order vanishing are called _ singular points of type iii_.    it is rather easy to see that the infinite volume free energy or the correlation kernels are analytic functions of the parameters of the problem as long as the underlying equilibrium measure is regular .",
    "hence , phase transitions ( in the physical sense of break of analyticity of the free energy ) are intimately connected to the singularities of the equilibrium measure ; this is the central idea of this work .",
    "our goal is to discuss the mechanisms of these phase transitions and to analyze the behavior of the free energy near its critical values .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of a random matrix ensemble near singular points of the equilibrium measure has been studied intensively ( see @xcite , to mention a few ) . a remarkable feature of this behavior is revealed in the so - called double scaling limit , where the parameters near the critical value are coupled with the @xmath12 ( the size of the matrix ) . in this case , with an appropriate scaling of the variables , the asymptotic behavior of the correlation kernel near the critical point depends only on the type of the singularity rather than on the potential itself , which is one of the manifestations of the universality in the random matrix models .",
    "it is known that the asymptotic behavior of the correlation kernel in a double scaling limit at the singular points is connected to the hierarchies of the painlev equations . in the general polynomial case ,",
    "the local behavior at the birth of the cut was described in @xcite ( in terms of orthogonal polynomials with respect to the freud weight @xmath105 on @xmath14 ) , and proved almost simultaneously in @xcite using the riemann - hilbert techniques . for the type ii singularity @xcite",
    ", the kernel can be written in terms of the hastings  mcleod solution of the painlev ii equation , while for the type iii singularity , the kernel is related to the painlev i transcendent @xcite .",
    "the double - scaling asymptotic analysis of this sort is beyond the scope and techniques of this paper .",
    "in the study of measures minimizing the total energy functional it is often convenient to consider simultaneously solutions of certain more general but closely related types of equilibrium problems and associated measures , which we call _ critical measures_. we discuss here two kinds of critical measures  the local minima and the saddle points of the energy , used to derive an equation for the cauchy transform of equilibrium measure ( see theorem [ lem : mfra09a ] below ) . in this connection",
    "we make also a few general remarks on the equations that can be useful for the constructive determination of the equilibrium measures .",
    "we fix a smooth external field @xmath106 and @xmath31 .",
    "recall that the pair consisting of a positive measure @xmath107 ( the equilibrium measure with total mass @xmath0 ) and and an ( equilibrium ) constant @xmath108 is uniquely defined by the ( equilibrium ) conditions ; measure @xmath109 is also the unique global minimizer of the total energy in the class @xmath110 . under the assumptions above ,",
    "it is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , so that @xmath111 on @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , the problem of the constructive determination of @xmath61 boils down to finding its support @xmath58 , a problem that has been under investigation for a few decades .",
    "the main conclusion is that this problem has a simple constructive solution if @xmath58 is a single interval ( see e.g.  @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv ) ) ; when the support is not connected , a satisfactory constructive solution is not available .",
    "let us provide some details in this respect .",
    "assume that the support is a union of @xmath112 disjoint intervals , @xmath113 , \\quad a_1<a_2<\\dots < a_{2p}.\\ ] ] differentiating the equality part of the equilibrium conditions one obtains the singular integral equation @xmath114 this equation on the unknown function @xmath115 , given a fixed @xmath58 in and a fixed @xmath116 , is a well known object in the theory of singular integral equations .",
    "a general solution of this equation may be written in terms of singular integrals ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 ,  4 ) , as well as @xcite ) .",
    "the explicit expression for this solution is not so relevant here , but it renders a system of @xmath117 equations on the @xmath118 endpoints @xmath119 of the support @xmath58 ( see equations below ) that are central to our discussion .    condition @xmath106 implies that @xmath120 , and in particular , that the density of the equilibrium measure is bounded on @xmath58 .",

    "if they are satisfied , the problem is solved .",
    "can this solution be regarded as constructive ?",
    "we can certainly assert this in the one - cut situation .",
    "but we are inclined to give a rather negative answer in the multi - cut case . to the best of our knowledge",

    "let us point out that once @xmath58 has been established , it determines the partition of the total mass @xmath0 into its `` portions '' @xmath136 these values are closely related to the so - called t hooft parameters in the gauge theories .",
    "we can make additional progress under the assumption that the external field is analytic on the real line .",

    "the representation remains valid , as well as many of its corollaries derived in this paper , with some obvious modifications .",

    "the proof of theorem [ lem : mfra09a ] actually carries over to a more general situation , e.g.  when @xmath150 is meromorphic ( in this case @xmath151 might have poles at the location of poles of @xmath150 ) . in a more physical context , was obtained for instance as the saddle - point approximation to the large @xmath12 limit of the number of planar feynman diagrams of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the meromorphic @xmath150 has found applications also in the study of the asymptotic distribution of zeros of heine - stieltjes polynomials @xcite or in the analysis of the phase transition in matrix model with logarithmic action @xcite .",

    "it follows further ( as it was shown in @xcite ) that the support @xmath58 of @xmath61 consists of a finite number of intervals , whose endpoints are simple real zeros of @xmath154 ; the unknown zeros of @xmath154 become the main parameters determining @xmath61 and its support .    in this representation",
