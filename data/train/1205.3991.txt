    "radio interferometry provides a powerful tool for probing the structure of the polarised emission from celestial sources .",
    "such measurements are made by detecting two orthogonal polarization states at each antenna and cross  correlating all combinations . to utilize such observations ,",
    "corrections must be applied for the effects of the independent electronics in addition to paths through the atmosphere and errors in the assumed geometric model that corrupt the data .",
    "most of the geometric and atmospheric effects modifying the arrival time of a given wavefront are the same for the two polarization states at a given antenna but differences in the electronics used for the two polarization states will introduce an instrumental polarized delay and phase .    the traditional calibration technique for radio interferometric data , especially when the receptors measure the orthogonal circular polarizations , has been to determine the calibration for the two hands of polarization separately .",
    "this effectively ignores both the polarization of the calibrator and the spurious polarized response of the instrument .    for systems measuring circular polarization and using synchrotron sources for calibration",
    ", this is generally a good approximation .",
    "the circular polarization of the typical compact radio source is less than 0.1% and the spurious instrumental polarization response of the order of a few % .",
    "this approximation is less valid for interferometers measuring orthogonal linearly polarized signals as the same calibrators typically have linear polarizations of a percent or less at frequencies below a few hundred mhz up to @xmath010% at frequencies above a few tens of ghz @xcite .",
    "independent calibration of the parallel  hands also has the disadvantage that it allows an arbitrary group delay and phase offset between the two parallel systems .",
    "the offsets between the parallel  hands need to be determined and removed before the cross ",
    "polarized visibilities can be used for astronomical imaging .",
    "these cross ",
    "polarized visibilities may be dominated by the linear polarization of the source which can be used for cross  polarized calibration ; this case is considered in the following .",
    "one technique used in the past was to `` fringe fit '' , fit for group delay and delay rate , independently for the parallel  hand visibilities @xcite , apply this calibration and then do single baseline delay fitting of a few cross  polarized visibility spectra and average the results @xcite .",
    "an alternate technique @xcite is to use closure constraints on the results of a series of single baseline fringe fits to determine the offsets between the parallel hand systems .",
    "both of these techniques have limited sensitivity .",
    "this paper explores an improved technique in the obit package @xcite.bcotton / obit.html ]",
    "telescopes using heterodyne electronics as are commonly used in interferometers at radio wavelengths are sensitive to a single polarization state of the incoming wave . in order to fully sample both polarization states of the celestial signals ,",
    "sets of electronics nominally sensitive to orthogonal polarizations are used . to sample the full state of the visibility measured with an interferometer , cross ",
    "correlations of all ( 4 ) combinations of the polarizations states are made on each baseline , or pair of antennas .",
    "denote the various visibilities measured between antennas @xmath1 and @xmath2 and using detectors for polarization states @xmath3 and @xmath4 as @xmath5 .",
    "typically , either right and left  hand circular polarizations ( `` r '' , `` l '' ) or orthogonal linear polarizations ( `` x '' , `` y '' ) are used in radio interoferometers .    in practice ,",
    "the two polarizations measured are not precisely those desired but can be modeled by the desired state plus a complex value , called the `` leakage '' term , @xmath6 , times the orthogonal state .",
    "thus , the signal received by a detector on antenna @xmath1 nominally in polarization state @xmath3 is actually : @xmath7 the leakage terms will result in a spurious polarized response which is referred to as `` instrumental polarization '' in the following .",
    "to first order ( ignoring products of source and instrumental polarization terms ) , the interferometric response for an interferometer between antennas @xmath1 and @xmath2 using linear detectors of an unresolved source is @xcite : @xmath8 , \\\\",

    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] the impact of source polarization on parallel hand calibration can be seen from eqs ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "stokes v is generally very small compared to stokes i , much less than a percent and can relatively safely be ignored in eq ( 4 ) . on the other hand , values of stokes q and u of a few percent of stokes i will limit the accuracy of parallel hand calibration if ignored in eq ( 2 ) .    @xcite give a discussion of the three calibration parameters that can not be constrained from only parallel hand data . if the source and instrumental polarizations can be considered negligible , the third and its frequency derivative can be obtained using the linear polarization of the calibrator . for more details on the response of an interferometer to a partially polarized signal",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if the calibrator and instrumental polarizations are sufficiently small to be ignored , the two parallel polarized sets of visibilities can be assumed to be independent measurements of the same celestial quantities . for a given baseline , @xmath22 , the measured correlations ( @xmath23 )",
    "are related to the calibrated visibilities ( @xmath24 ) by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is given by : @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the amplitude correction , @xmath29 the group delay residual from the correlator model , @xmath30 the model phase residual , and @xmath31 the observing frequency .",
    "calibration parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be determined from observations of ( calibrator ) sources of known brightness , structure and position .",
    "calibration quantities are generally functions of time and frequency .",
    "this system of equations is degenerate in that only differences in @xmath29 and @xmath30 are actually measured . the system is frequently made determinate by assigning the values of a `` reference antenna '' to zero .",
    "thus , all phase  like quantities are determined relative to the reference antenna leaving only the relationship between the two hands of polarization at the reference antenna undetermined . if the electronics of the reference antenna are sufficiently stable , the differences between the two parallel hands at the reference antenna will be stable in time .",
    "independent calibration of the parallel  hand systems allows for a difference between @xmath32 and @xmath33 as well as between @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 indicates the reference antenna .",
    "denote these differences as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "note : if the observing bandwidth is divided into multiple `` spectral windows '' with at least partially independent electronics and signal paths , the calibration parameters may vary between spectral windows .",
    "the relation per spectral window between parallel  hand calibrated data ( @xmath39 ) and cross  hand calibrated data ( @xmath40 ) is : @xmath41 note : this requires a single pair of values , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , per spectral window . a sample baseline of evla ( circular polarization ) calibrator data with parallel  hand but",
    "not cross  hand calibration applied is shown in figure [ norldly ] .",
    "while there are but two parameters to be determined per spectral window , there are a number of complications .",
    "the most serious of these is spurious instrumental polarization ( @xmath6 in eqs .",
    "[ xypol ] and [ rlpol ] ) which can contribute a significant fraction of the strength of the source polarization to the cross  polarized visibilities .",
    "to first order , this spurious instrumental polarization is independent of source polarization and can vary strongly with frequency and baseline .",
    "a second complication is for arrays with alt - az mounts for which the antenna rotates with parallactic angle as seem by the source ( eq . [ parang ] ) .",
    "if no correction is made and the antennas detect circular polarization , a varying parallactic angle will cause the source polarization to rotate in polarization angle while the instrumental polarization is constant .",
    "if the data are corrected for parallactic angle , the instrumental polarization then rotates while the source polarization is constant .",
    "a further complication is the case in which the source has significantly resolved polarized structure . in this case , the source component of the cross ",
    "polarized response will vary with time , frequency and baseline .",
    "consider the case of the evla with alt - az mounts and detectors sensitive to circular polarization observing an unresolved source whose linear polarization is much stronger than the instrumental polarization .",
    "if these data have their phases corrected for parallactic angle and have parallel  hand calibration applied , the cross ",
    "polarized spectra are from eq .",
    "[ rlpol ] : @xmath42 thus , the @xmath43 and @xmath44 spectra are the complex conjugates of each other and this relationship holds for all baselines and times . in the case",
    "represented here , the cross ",
    "polarized spectra can be averaged over all baselines and times and the averaged spectra used to fit for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the solution for @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be separated and done independently . the group delay ( @xmath37 ) can be determined from the value of @xmath45 which maximizes : @xmath46 using a direct parameter search over @xmath45 and @xmath47 denotes the modulus .",
    "the summation is over spectra for all included times and baselines .",
    "the phase ( @xmath38 ) is then the phase of the average of the delay corrected visibilities : @xmath48\\ ] ] the analysis above is only valid if the cross  polarised visibilities include a significant detection of the polarized signal .",
    "the typical `` signal  to - noise ratio '' ( @xmath49 ) of the individual channel samples can be estimated from the rms scatter of their phases about the mean in radians and the approximation that : @xmath50 for an @xmath51 1 .",
    "channel averages over baseline and time can be used to increase the @xmath49 of individual samples .    in general , the instrumental polarization is not negligible compared to the source polarization but should vary from baseline - to - baseline .",
    "furthermore , after the data are corrected for the parallactic angle , the instrumental polarization will vary with parallactic angle , hence time . averaging over baselines and time",
    "will reduce the contribution of the instrumental polarization to the averaged @xmath43 and @xmath44 spectra .",
    "the case of interferometers , such as alma or the atca , whose elements are sensitive to linear polarization , is more complex . as can be see from eq .",
    "[ xypol ] , the source polarization component of the cross  hand visibility spectrum is : @xmath52 stokes v for most sources is very small and can be ignored .",
    "however , the linearly polarized component is a more complex function of parallactic angle and can only be averaged over a time range and set of baselines for which the variation of parallactic angle is small .",
    "the averaged xy and yx spectra can be used to determine the x - y delay difference as was done for circular feeds in the section above and the snr of the data can be determined as well .",
    "variation of the instrumental polarization among baselines will reduce its effect on the averaged spectra .",
    "the technique outlined above has been implemented in the obit@xcite package available through task rldly .",
    "the fitting is that described in the previous sections except using weighted sums to fit for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the weights used are the data quality weights assigned to the data which are inversely proportional to the visibility noise variance .",
    "the implementation in rldly allows for dropping the end channels in each spectral window which may be poor representations of the values being fitted . in this case",
    "the phase ramp applied to the spectra still begins with the first channel in each spectrum .",
    "the calibration data from an evla observation was used to test this technique .",
    "the data included the bandpass 6.08.0 ghz in 16 spectral windows ( ifs ) each averaged to 16 channels .",
    "the observations included 5 @xmath53 15 second scans over roughly 5 hours on the strongly linearly polarized calibrator 3c286 ( @xmath54 % ) .",
    "the evla has detectors sensitive to circular polarization and alt - az antenna mounts .",
    "data had strong , non  celestial signals removed and were initially calibrated using the standard parallel  hand techniques ; a sample of these data on one of the longer baselines is shown in figure [ norldly ] .",
    "corrections were applied for parallactic angle so all times were used in the fitting .",
    "the data were obtained in the `` a '' configuration for which the synthesized beam is about 0.25  fwhm .",
    "3c286 is well resolved in this configuration but the bulk of the emission , both total and polarized intensity is from the marginally resolved core .",
    "therefore , all baselines were used for the fitting .",
    "a target r - l phase of 66@xmath55 and rotation measure of 0 rad / m were provided .",
    "the outer 3 channels on each end of each spectral window were omitted from the fitting of the 3c286 data .    the cross ",
    "polarized corrections were applied to the data .",
    "the same data shown in figure [ norldly ] after this recalibration are shown in figure [ wrldly ] .",
    "the rapid variation of the cross  polarized phase with frequency is largely eliminated .",
    "variations of phase with frequency remaining are due to the frequency variable instrumental polarization which has not been corrected ; these can be corrected using aips task pcal .",
    "the fluctuations of instrumental polarization are also visible in the cross  polarized amplitudes .",
    "note that the parallel ",
    "polarized data are unaffected by the cross  polarized calibration .    in order to test the effect of a weakly polarized calibrator ,",
    "the same test was run but using as calibrator j1504 + 1029 whose polarization ( @xmath56 % ) is less than the typical baseline instrumental polarization . a plot of the data shown in figures [ norldly ] and [ wrldly ] after calibration using this source is given in figure [ wrldly1504 ] .",
    "a relatively general and robust method for fitting instrumental cross  polarized group delays and phases is presented and tested using evla data . in these tests , the large phase slope in the cross ",
    "polarized spectra due to the difference in the parallel  hand group delays is essentially removed .",
    "the fitting of data from circularly polarized detectors and a strongly linearly polarized unresolved calibrator , as in the first test presented , is relatively straightforward as all baselines are measuring essentially the same value and much averaging can be incorporated .",
    "more extensive testing will be needed in the case of weakly polarized calibrators where the cross - polarized visibilities will be dominated by instrumental polarization and arrays using linearly polarized detectors for which time averaging need be more limited .",
    "one test on the same dataset as discussed above using a calibrator whose polarized emission is less than the typical baseline instrumental polarization resulted in cross ",
    "polarized delay fits comparable to those derived from 3c286 although with larger scatter in the r ",
    "l phase .",
    "fitting for cross ",
    "polarized group delays is needed prior to fitting for instrumental polarization if any averaging in frequency is to be used in the calibration fitting .",
    "fitting for cross  polarized phases at this point will be only approximate due to corruption by the instrumental polarization and will need to be redetermined after removal of the instrumental polarization .",
    "the technique described here can also be applied to vlbi data for which the parallactic angle is different amoung the various antennas at a given time if the data are initially corrected for parallactic angle ( circular feeds are generally used for vlbi ) . at vlbi resolutions",
    "there is generally significant resolution of the polarized emission of even calibrators and a limited range of baselines may need to be used .",
