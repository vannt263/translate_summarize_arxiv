    "the existence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the one - band two - dimensional hubbard model has been established through a variety of theoretical methods at both weak  @xcite and strong coupling  @xcite , in other words for one - site interaction @xmath2",
    "either much smaller or much larger than the bandwidth @xmath10 . generalizations of dynamical mean - field theory are particularly suited for the strong coupling limit , but they are also an excellent guide to the physics at weak to intermediate coupling .",
    "@xcite , these calculations suggest that pairing is maximized at intermediate coupling , where the on - site interaction @xmath2 is of order the bandwidth @xmath3 .",
    "some non - perturbative calculations based on weak coupling ideas even agree at intermediate coupling  @xcite with strong - coupling based approaches .    in all these approaches , spin fluctuations with either an antiferromagnetic or a singlet character  @xcite",
    "have been argued to drive the pairing .",
    "these spin fluctuations result from the presence of an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath2 . at strong coupling ,",
    "the characteristic energy scale of these fluctuations , the exchange interaction @xmath6 , is given by @xmath11 , and the @xmath0-wave gap symmetry adopted by the cooper pairs allows them to avoid the direct effect of the on - site repulsion @xmath2 .",
    "little attention has been paid so far to the effect of the nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion ( or extended hubbard interaction ) @xmath5 that we expect to be detrimental to @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "roughly speaking , in a simple bcs picture that does not take retardation into account , we expect the effective interaction to be the difference @xmath12 . in ordinary phonon - mediated superconductivity ,",
    "the repulsion @xmath5 is replaced by a smaller pseudopotential @xmath13 to account for the fact that binding occurs at low frequencies through phonons while the coulomb interaction acts over a broad energy scale .",
    "this so - called anderson - morel mechanism  @xcite , leads to the following estimate for the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath14 where the debye frequency is @xmath15 and the fermi energy @xmath16 .",
    "one expects that in strongly - correlated superconductivity , the ratio @xmath17 must be replaced by a number closer to unity in which case this mechanism would no - longer be effective and superconductivity should disappear as soon as @xmath18 .",
    "this issue is crucial to understand high - temperature superconductors since that condition , or the weaker condition @xmath19 with @xmath20 the spin gap , is likely to be satisfied in these materials . from the value of the near - neighbor coulomb interaction with a relative dielectric constant of order 10 we estimate @xmath21 mev while @xmath22 mev  @xcite .",
    "so far , it has been shown using a variational wave - function approach for the @xmath23 model at strong coupling that superconductivity persists as long as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the doping .",
    "a large - n calculation gives superconductivity at least up to @xmath26 ,  @xcite while density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations on hubbard or @xmath27 ladders  @xcite suggest that pairing can survive up to @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite at very small coupling ( @xmath29 ) , it has been argued  @xcite that pairing is destroyed as soon as @xmath30 .",
    "this weak coupling bound is close to the result of a flex calculation .",
    "@xcite    here we show that @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the one - band two - dimensional hubbard model at strong coupling is in fact more robust than expected . even for @xmath7 , as long as the inequality @xmath31 is satisfied , superconductivity persists",
    "this illustrates differences between pairing at weak and at strong coupling , especially in the pseudogap regime .",
    "the resilience of @xmath0-wave superconductivity to @xmath5 can be traced to the increase in the effective @xmath6 caused by @xmath5 at strong coupling , i.e. when at half - filling the system is a mott insulator .",
    "this increase in @xmath6 is visible in the dynamics of both the spin susceptibility and the cooper pair green s function which is enhanced by @xmath5 at low frequency .",
    "the pair - breaking effect of @xmath5 manifests itself at higher frequency .",
    "this leads overall to a sizeable range of values of @xmath5 where the order parameter is essentially independent of @xmath5 in the underdoped regime where a pseudogap appears .",
    "recall that at strong coupling , the pseudogap extends up to optimal doping , a sign that mott physics extends well beyond half - filling  @xcite .",
    "we use cellular - dynamical mean - field theory that allows us to study the strong - coupling limit and allows one to take into account both @xmath6 and @xmath5 as well as the effect of retardation .",
    "we first present the method and model and conclude with a discussion after the presentation of the results obtained from large scale numerical calculations .",
    "we start from the one - band extended hubbard model on a square lattice , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the destruction ( creation ) operator for an electron of spin @xmath34 at site @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the corresponding number operator ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we assume a band structure close to that of yba@xmath38cu@xmath39o@xmath40 , with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath41 set to unity , diagonal hopping @xmath42 and third - neighbor hopping @xmath43 , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "this model is solved with a 4 site plaquette cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft ) at @xmath44 using an exact diagonalization solver  @xcite that allows us to obtain real - time quantities without analytic continuation .",
    "this approach has been used to reveal the presence of @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the one - band hubbard model,@xcite and to study the pairing dynamics and retardation when @xmath45 .",
    "@xcite the results obtained for @xmath0-wave superconductivity with the plaquette are essentially identical to those obtained with larger clusters .",

    "[ fig : cluster ] , with 6 parameters to be determined through the cdmft self - consistency relation : the hybridizations @xmath46 between the bath and the cluster , the bath energies @xmath47 and the bath @xmath0-wave pairing parameters @xmath48 which , when nonzero , signal the presence of superconductivity and lead to a non - vanishing cluster @xmath0-wave order parameter @xmath49    the order parameter is extracted from the lattice green s function while the doping is measured on the cluster .",
    "the distance function is defined in ref .  .",
    "we use cutoff @xmath50 and fictitious inverse temperature @xmath51 .    while the extended interaction @xmath5 within the cluster can be treated exactly with an approach like cdmft , the coupling to neighboring clusters requires the hartree approximation .",
    "@xcite more specifically , the model hamiltonian eq .",
    "is modified by replacing the inter - cluster interaction by @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes nearest - neighbor pairs within the plaquette and @xmath54 nearest - neighbor pairs across plaquettes .",
    "the mean field @xmath55 must be determined self - consistently ; in practice , it is treated like the six bath parameters wihtin the cdmft self - consistency loop and thus both the dynamical mean field ( represented by the bath parameters ) and the static hartree mean field are converged simultaneously .    to verify the accuracy of this approach , consider momentarily the half - filled , particle - hole symmetric extended hubbard model with @xmath56 . in that simple case , the hartree field @xmath55",
    "is fixed by particle - hole symmetry .",
    "we find that the dynamical spin susceptibility at the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath57 has a dominant peak at a low frequency @xmath58 .",
    "the position of this peak is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_hf ] as a function of @xmath5 for two values of @xmath2 . in the large @xmath2 limit",
    ", the half - filled extended hubbard model should map to the heisenberg model with a super - exchange parameter @xmath9 . the energy denominator is easily understood by comparing the energy , at @xmath59 , between a configuration where all sites are exactly singly - occupied and another configuration in which one electron has vacated a site in order to doubly occupy a neighboring site .",
    "four @xmath5 bonds are lost , but three are gained . since we expect the frequency @xmath58 to scale like @xmath6 in the large-@xmath2 limit , fig .",
    "[ fig : chi_hf ] confirms that we obtain the correct scaling with @xmath5 .",
    "hence , our approach leads to the correct strong - coupling physics .",
    "to concentrate on the effect of short - range spin fluctuations on superconductivity , we ignore the possibility of long - range antiferromagnetic order predicted by cdmft at low doping ,  @xcite as well as the possibility of long - range charge density waves in the presence of @xmath5 . at weak coupling charge - density waves",
    "may occur for @xmath60 in two - dimensions .",
    "@xcite we found a similar result at half - filling for strong coupling .",
    "the @xmath0-wave order parameter for ybco hopping parameters is displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : op ] for hole - doping at @xmath61 , 8 and 16 . in each panel , obtained for a given value of @xmath2 , we display the results for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the mott transition at half - filling , that separates weak from strong coupling , occurs around @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite as observed before ,  @xcite in the weak coupling case ( @xmath61 ) superconductivity is strongest at half - filling when competition with antiferromagnetism is prohibited ( fig .",
    "[ fig : op]a ) . at larger coupling ,",
    "the mott transition destroys superconductivity at half - filling ( figs .",
    "[ fig : op]b , c ) .",
    "the value of @xmath5 influences the order parameter in strikingly different ways at weak and at strong coupling . for @xmath61 ,",
    "superconductivity has essentially disappeared at @xmath63 , in agreement with the upper limit @xmath64 found by weak coupling analysis .",
    "@xcite this is consistent with the fact that at weak coupling , @xmath5 always decreases the strength of spin fluctuations .",
    "@xcite by contrast , at strong coupling , @xmath5 can increase the strength of spin fluctuations through @xmath9 , and for the same ratio @xmath65 , the order parameter is still large for @xmath66 on fig .",
    "[ fig : op]b .",
    "in fact , it is barely influenced by @xmath5 in the pseudogap ( underdoped ) regime close to half - filling ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "on the lower panel , for @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 at @xmath70 and superconductivity still persists .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 is maximum at @xmath72 .",
    "we estimate that @xmath73 is the upper bound for the the appearance of @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( ignoring competing orders ) .",
    "the link between superconducting order parameter and spin fluctuations was demonstrated at @xmath45 by the correlation between the peaks in the imaginary part of the anomalous self - energy and the peaks in the spin fluctuation  @xcite .",
    "this correlation persists here ( not shown ) . to further investigate this link between spin fluctuations and superconductivity ,",
    "let us thus first focus on the spin dynamics revealed by the the local spin spectral function @xmath74 illustrated on fig .",

    "the corresponding charge susceptibility is negligible on this scale .",
    "spin fluctuations are much smaller in the overdoped regime and their weight is spread in wavevector contrary to the underdoped case .",
    "panel ( b ) shows that in the underdoped regime ( @xmath67 ) where there is a pseudogap , a moderate extended interaction @xmath5 at strong coupling mainly shifts the spectrum of @xmath77 spin fluctuations to higher frequencies , as expected from the increase of @xmath9 caused by @xmath5 ; it decreases somewhat the overall spectral weight without affecting the spectral shape .    to show that low - frequency spin fluctuations are apparent in the pair dynamics",
    ", we compare the characteristic frequency @xmath58 of spin fluctuations , given by the position of the dominant peak of @xmath78 , with a characteristic frequency in the pair dynamics , as was done in ref .  .",
    "the pair dynamics can be studied through the integral @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the retarded gorkov function ( or anomalous green s function ) defined in imaginary time by @xmath81 with @xmath35 and @xmath82 nearest - neighbors .",
    "the infinite frequency limit of @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 which in turn is proportional to the @xmath44 @xmath0-wave order parameter @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is useful to estimate the frequencies relevant for binding .",
    "we call @xmath86 the cumulative order parameter .    in bcs theory , @xmath87 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath88 that reaches its asymptotic value at the bcs cutoff frequency @xmath89 .",
    "@xcite in the eliashberg approach that includes retardation as well as the coulomb pseudopotential ,  @xcite the function overshoots its asymptotic value at frequencies near the main phonon frequencies before decaying to its final value because of pair breaking effects at higher frequencies .",
    "we define the characteristic frequency @xmath90 as the point where @xmath87 reaches half of its asymptotic value . if one imagines that @xmath91 is made of a single peak , then that peak would be located at @xmath90 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ig ] illustrates the cumulative order parameter @xmath87 for various values of @xmath5 .",
    "the top two panels are for two values of doping @xmath92 at @xmath66 , and the bottom one for @xmath68 in the underdoped regime .",
    "the asymptotic value is indicated by a horizontal line . following a sharp rise around @xmath93 ,",
    "the function has a maximum and then decreases towards its asymptotic value , as in eliashberg theory .",
    "the link between the characteristic spin - fluctuation frequency @xmath58 and the characteristic frequency of the pair @xmath90 is summarized on fig .",

    ". clearly , @xmath58 , @xmath94 and @xmath90 all decrease with doping .",
    "this shows that spin fluctuations and pair dynamics are strongly linked .    even for @xmath45",
    "however , the increase in @xmath6 as measured by @xmath95 and @xmath90 in the underdoped regime , @xmath96 , does not correspond to an increase in the order parameter .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : op ] , for @xmath67 and @xmath76 the @xmath0-wave order parameter is essentially identical when @xmath45 and the increase in @xmath90 near half - filling manifests itself only in the maximum value of the cumulative order parameter @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ig ] , not in the value of the order parameter .",
    "clearly the order parameter does not increase in the underdoped regime despite the increase in the characteristic spin fluctuation frequency @xmath95 because of another effect .",
    "that effect is the pseudogap .",
    "the pseudogap removes many of the states near the fermi energy that would otherwise be paired .",
    "the presence of the pseudogap can be seen by contrasting the single - particle local density of states at two dopings . in the overdoped regime ( @xmath76 )",
    "the local density of states has no pseudogap in the normal state , as seen from the dashed red line on fig .",
    "[ fig : dos]b .",

    "the effect of superconductivity manifests itself only through the small more symmetric gap near @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite the pseudogap , as measured from the peak to peak distance , increases slightly with @xmath5 in the underdoped regime .",
    "the detrimental effect of the pseudogap on the superconducting order parameter was demonstrated in fig .  7 of ref .   where the bubble contribution to the pairing susceptibility decreases as we approach half - filling .",
    "this means that in the absence of interactions between the particles forming the pair ( represented by vertex corrections ) , self - energy effects disfavor superconductivity .",
    "this physics is also present at weak to intermediate coupling when the pseudogap is induced by long wavelength antiferromagnetic fluctuations  @xcite ( and not by the incipient short - range mott localisation that appears at strong coupling  @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of spin fluctuations and of near - neighbor repulsion @xmath5 on pairing is relatively straightforward in the overdoped regime ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "there , as seen on fig .",
    "[ fig : op]b and figs .",
    "[ fig : u8]a , c , the order parameter increases with the characteristic spin frequency @xmath58 and the characteristic pair frequency @xmath90 . like for the @xmath45 case",
    ", superconductivity disappears at finite @xmath5 when the amplitude @xmath94 of the lowest frequency peak in the spin fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : u8]b ) vanishes ,  @xcite as observed in experiment .",
    "@xcite the main effect of @xmath5 is to decrease the spin fluctuations , as happens systematically at weak coupling .",
    "@xcite    as we approach half - filling , the decrease of the order parameter for all values of @xmath5 ( figs .",
    "[ fig : op]b , c ) , despite the increase in the amplitude @xmath94 of the lowest peak in the spin fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : u8 ] ) , is mainly due to the increase of the pseudogap : it removes more and more states from the fermi energy as the doping @xmath92 decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath5 causes opposite changes in the amplitude @xmath94 and in the characteristic frequencies ( figs  [ fig : u8 ] ) , which might explain the near independence of the order parameter with respect to @xmath5 in figs .",
    "[ fig : op]b , c . however , these changes are small on a relative scale and are probably not the main reason for the insensitivity of the order parameter to @xmath5 .",
    "the resilience of @xmath0-wave superconductivity to @xmath5 at strong coupling is best understood from the @xmath68 results for the cumulative order parameter @xmath86 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ig]c for @xmath67 .",
    "the largest value of @xmath86 scales roughly like @xmath9 , in other words @xmath5 increases the binding at low frequency , where the retardation is large .",
    "however , @xmath5 also has the expected pair - breaking effect : larger @xmath5 causes larger pair - breaking so that the low frequency increase in @xmath87 is essentially compensated by the time @xmath87 reaches its asymptotic value ( the order parameter ) .    to understand more deeply the dual role of @xmath5 , as both pair binding and pair breaking , it is helpful to return to the solution of the eliashberg equations in the electron - phonon case . figs .  7 , and 13 of ref .",
    "show that the imaginary part of the gap function remains positive for all frequencies when the coulomb pseudopotential vanishes .",
    "by contrast , one verifies from fig .",
    "11 of the same paper that the imaginary part of the gap function changes from positive to negative as frequency increases when the coulomb pseudopotential is finite .",
    "a sign change in the imaginary part of the gap function should lead to a similar behavior in the imaginary part of the gorkov function @xmath99 . in this case",
    "its integral @xmath87 , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ f(w ) ] ) , should reach a maximum before decreasing to its asymptotic large frequency value .",
    "by contrast , when the imaginary part of the gap function remains positive at all frequencies , i.e. in the absence of coulomb pseudopotential , @xmath87 should increase monotonically to its asymptotic value , as in bcs theory . since we observe that @xmath87 has a maximum at finite frequency , we are in the case where the coulomb pseudopotential is important .",
    "comparison of figs .  11 and 13 of ref .",
    "also shows that the maximum value of the imaginary part of the gap function ( and that of its frequency integral , as one can check ) increases with the electron - phonon coupling constant . in our case",
    ", the increase in @xmath9 caused by @xmath5 similarly leads to an increase in the maximum value of the cumulative order parameter @xmath87 .",
    "in other words , we can surmise that the increase in @xmath5 leads to larger binding at low frequency , like an increase in the electron - phonon coupling constant , but it also leads to more pair - breaking at large frequency , coming from the coulomb pseudopotential - like effect of @xmath5 , and these two effects nearly cancel each other .    in the electron - phonon case",
    ", one also notes that the imaginary part of the gap function vanishes at about two to three times the maximum phonon frequency .",
    "this is where the cumulative order parameter @xmath87 would reach its asymptotic value . in the case of spin fluctuations , @xmath100 is a measure of the width of the spin - fluctuation spectrum . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : ig]a for @xmath66 and fig .",
    "[ fig : ig]c for @xmath68 , one notices that the frequency for which @xmath87 reaches its asymptotic value is smaller by a factor of roughly two for @xmath68 where the @xmath45 value of @xmath6 is twice as small as for @xmath66 .",
    "the opposing effects discussed above conspire to leave the order parameter rather insensitive to @xmath5 in the presence of a pseudogap .",
    "the pseudogap induced by mott physics  @xcite is detrimental to superconductivity , but in its presence superconductivity is effectively protected from near - neighbour repulsion @xmath5 .",
    "indeed , in a doped mott insulator , short - range incipient localisation is strong enough to create a pseudogap , but while @xmath5 causes pair - breaking at high frequency , it also enhances spin fluctuations ( @xmath9 ) at low frequencies , thus compensating the pair - breaking effect .",
