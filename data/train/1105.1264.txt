    "negative_. note the signs of the pairs do not change when the orientation on the knot is reversed .",
    "note , moreover , that if the crossings of an unoriented knot are split into matched unoriented pairs , then , introducing any orientation , we always get counter - directed pairs shown in fig .",

    "any rational knot has a matched diagram , because any rational number can be represented by a continued fraction with even ( positive or negative ) denominators ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the standard diagram of the knot @xmath0 ( which is not rational )        can be easily transformed to a matched form :        \\3 .",
    "we managed to find matched diagrams for all table knots with up to 8 crossings , save for the knot @xmath1 .",
    "the problem raised by jozef przytycki in 1987 is to investigate which knots possess a matched diagram .",
    "this question appears in the well - known collection `` open problems in topology '' maintained by rob kirby @xcite , as part of problem 1.60 .",
    "more exactly , conjecture 1(a ) therein ( belonging to przytycki @xcite ) reads : `` there are oriented knots without a matched diagram '' .",
    "as the reader understands , the word `` oriented '' can be here omitted without any loss of meaning .",
    "this conjecture stayed open for 24 years , notwithstanding the effort of several excellent mathematicians , including its author and j.  conway @xcite .",
    "we give a positive solution to the conjecture , that is , demonstrate that some knots , e.g. pretzel knot with parameters @xmath2 , are not bipartite . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce our main construction , which also explains the meaning of the word `` bipartite '' in this context .",
    "consider a matched diagram of a knot @xmath3 . replace every matched pair of crossings by two parallel segments , directed as the knot and joined by a common perpendicular ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : p2 ] .        the parallel segments",
    "are then joined by the remaining fragments of the knot diagram into a simple closed line on the plane , straightenable into a circle , whereas the common perpendiculars become _ chords_. an example for the matched diagram of the knot @xmath0 mentioned above , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : md - cd ] , where the inner and outer chords are changed places : this leads to turning the knot diagram inside outside with respect to some point and does not alter the isotopy type of the knot .",
    "chord diagram , height=151 ]    the chord diagrams obtained in this way , are rather special : the set of all chords is split into two parts ( inner chords and outer chords ) , so that the chords in each part do not intersect between themselves , and the intersection graph of the whole diagram is bipartite .",
    "this procedure is reversible : from a bipartite signed chord diagram one can reconstruct the knot diagram in a unique way ( see fig .",

    "a seifert surface @xmath4 of a knot is a compact oriented surface embedded in @xmath5 so that its boundary is the given knot . choosing a basis in @xmath6",
    ", one can construct a matrix of the bilinear form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the linking number , and @xmath9 is a small shift in the positive direction along the normal of @xmath4 .",
    "this matrix is called a seifert matrix of the given knot .",
    "there is a standard procedure to construct a seifert from any diagram , using checkerboard coloring and seifert circles . for matched diagrams there",
    "exists a different construction , which is crucial for our needs : it yields a seifert matrix of a special type , which , in turn , produces an alexander matrix with extraordinary properties .",
    "[ lemma1 ] any bipartite knot has a seifert surface such that its seifert matrix has the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are square matrices of the same size , @xmath11 is a unit matrix , @xmath12 is a zero matrix , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are both symmetric integer matrices .    consider a bipartite knot @xmath3 and its plane diagram , construct the chord diagram as indicated above .",
    "start constructing the seifert surface from the inner circle of the chord diagram , out of which we cut out every chord together with a small open neighborhood and glue instead a double twisted band , so that the direction of the twists corresponds to the sign of the chord ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : p3 ] ) .",
    "so far the surface remains orientable , and its boundary follows the knot as much as it can .",
    "now we must add the bands along the outer chords . here",
    "one must be cautious , because simply connecting the ends of the two half - chords by two half - twisted bands results in an unorientable surface .",
    "we will do as follows : first attach a band along each outer chord , then , around the middle of that band , we attach a perpendicular small band , which is twice twisted opposite to the sign of the chord .",
    "we show this procedure on fig .",
    "[ fig : p4 ] for one chord on big scale and on fig .",
    "[ seifert ] for a whole seifert surface of a certain knot . in the latter picture",
    ", the narrow twice twisted bands on the left and on the right should be though of as lying above the surface of the corresponding perpendicular wide bands .",
    "the thick solid lines indicate the boundary of the seifert surface ; the four small dashed segments show parts of the visible contour of the surface which do not belong to its boundary .",
    "the two sides of the seifert surface ( which is two - sided by definition ) are indicated by different shades of gray .",

    "[ fig : p5 ] .",
    "( left ) and @xmath17 ( right),scaledwidth=70.0% ]    it follows that the seifert matrix for this seifert surface ( see @xcite ) has the form @xmath18 where @xmath12 , @xmath11 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are matrices of size @xmath19 , @xmath11 is the unit matrix , @xmath12 is the zero matrix , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 is a diagonal matrix with numbers @xmath22 on the diagonal ( the sign is inverse to the sign of the outer chord number @xmath23 ) .",
    "the cycles @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be chosen so that not to have common points , if @xmath26 , therefore , @xmath27 and thus the matrix @xmath14 is symmetric .",
    "this construction shows that , on a practical side , it is advisable to turn the diagram inside outside , if the number of outer chords is bigger than that of inner chords  as we did before for the example knot @xmath0 .",
    "the determinant of the alexander matrix @xmath28 is equal to the alexander polynomial of the knot @xmath3 ; it is an element of the ring of laurent polynomials @xmath29 $ ] , determined up to multiplication by invertible elements of the ring , that is , monomials @xmath30 .",
    "the alexander matrix is not determined by the knot uniquely ; in fact , to any knot there corresponds a big family of alexander matrices related between themselves by a set of equivalence transformations which is well known ( see @xcite . in particular , even the size of the matrix @xmath31 is not invariant .",
    "what is invariant , however , is the sequence of alexander ideals , the @xmath32-th ideal being defined as the ideal in @xmath29 $ ] generated by all minors of an arbitrary alexander matrix of size @xmath33 , where @xmath15 is the smallest among the number of columns and rows in @xmath31 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that the alexander polynomial can be rewritten in terms of the conway variable @xmath34 ; in general , this is no longer true about the generators of all alexander ideals . in the case of bipartite knots , we can prove a stronger assertion .",
    "[ lemma2 ] if the knot @xmath3 is bipartite , then there exists a square integer matrix @xmath35 such that the matrix @xmath36 is an alexander matrix for @xmath3 ( here @xmath11 is the unit matrix ) .",

    "put @xmath28 , multiply the left block column by @xmath38 , the second by @xmath39 , then interchange both columns . using the symmetry of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "we get : @xmath40 by a sequence of elementary transformations , we can make zero the upper right block of this matrix , using its right lower block : in doing so , we will be always adding polynomials @xmath41 to the elements of left upper block . in the end ,",
    "the matrix will become @xmath42    to achieve our goal , it only suffices to prove one technical proposition .",

    "then @xmath55 is divisible by @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 and the ideal is trivial .",
    "the last lemmas show that the alexander ideals of bipartite knots can not be arbitrary .",
    "in particular , they are always generated by polynomials in @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath3 by a bipartite knot .",
    "if the alexander ideal @xmath58 is non - trivial , then it can not contain the polynomial @xmath53 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of lemmas [ lemma2 ] and [ lemma3 ]",
    ".    this condition immediately give a series of knots which are not bipartite .",

    "also known as the pretzel knot with parameters @xmath2 , a detailed calculation of the second alexander ideal is available from @xcite . for other knots from the given list",
    ", we borrowed the result from computer generated tables of knot atlas @xcite .",
    "contrary to the universal tradition , we allow ourselves to raise the carpet and explain how we actually arrived at this solution .",
    "it was clear to us from the beginning that the rational knots are all bipartite .",
    "then we designed a procedure to very quickly compute the conway polynomial of a bipartite graph , starting from the corresponding signed intersection graph . looking through the table of all knots through 8 crossings , we managed to find the bipartite graphs that would give the same conway polynomials , and after one or two tries , using knotscape @xcite and knotinfo @xcite , we obtained a bipartite representation for the corresponding knots .",
    "this worked for all knots , save for @xmath1 .",
    "now , this is the only knot until 8 crossings with nontrivial second alexander ideal .",
    "we looked at other knots with nontrivial second alexander ideal and found some that can not be expressed through the conway variable @xmath57 . on the other hand",
    ", we devised a procedure to represent the alexander matrix of a bipartite graph in terms of @xmath57 .",
    "after this work was finished , the second author ( m.  sh . ) invented another argument showing that a knot with second alexander ideal @xmath61 , e.g. the table knot @xmath62 , can not be bipartite .",
    "a separate publication is being prepared to this end .    to summarize ,",
    "we have presented a sufficient condition for a knot not to have any matched diagram .",
    "we do not know , however , of any reasonable necessary condition in terms of alexander ideals .",
