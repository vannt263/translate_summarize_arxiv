    "methods based on the self - consistent mean - field approach @xcite are up to now the only microscopic tools that can be applied to all nuclei including the heaviest ones .",
    "however , mean - field methods have several limitations , and the method that we present here is part of an attempt to eliminate two of the most penalizing presented in a series of papers .",
    "the first limitation is due to the determination of a wave function in an intrinsic frame of reference .",
    "although the symmetry - breaking mean - field approach is a very efficient and transparent way to grasp the effect of correlations associated with collective modes in the limit of strong correlations @xcite , the absence of good quantum numbers and the corresponding selection rules does not allow direct determination of the electromagnetic transition probabilities .",
    "instead , approximations have to derived based on the collective model and these can not cover all possible cases as they are well justified only in the limit of large deformation .",
    "the second limitation concerns nuclei for which a mean - field description through a single configuration breaks down because several configurations with different shell structure are close in energy without being separated by a large potential barrier .",
    "methods to overcome these two problems have been proposed in the past , but it is only in the last ten years that sufficient computational resources have become available to construct and apply methods based on realistic effective energy density functionals aiming at eliminating both of these limitations",
    ".    angular momentum projection @xcite is the key tool to transform the mean - field wave function from the intrinsic to the laboratory frame of reference . there is no ambiguity in determining directly electromagnetic transition probabilities when working in the laboratory system .",
    "however , without the simplifying assumption of axial states , the restoration of rotational symmetry requires that rotations about three euler angles be considered .",
    "so far , for mean - field states with triaxial quadrupolar deformations , this has been mostly done in the context of phenomenological models by using small shell model spaces and often schematic interactions @xcite . in the context of energy density functional methods ,",
    "projection on angular momentum of mean - field states with triaxial quadrupolar deformations has been performed at the hartree - fock level by using a simplified skyrme interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite and very recently with a full skyrme energy functional in ref .",
    "@xcite . cranked wave functions have been projected in both cases to approximate a variation after projection on the angular momentum @xcite , but pairing correlations were not included .    to solve the problem of energy surfaces that are soft with respect to a collective degree of freedom , one has to introduce fluctuations in this collective degree of freedom into the ground - state wave function using the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "again , many studies used small shell model spaces and schematic interactions , but there is also a quite a large body of work starting from mean - field methods based on effective interactions in the full model space of occupied single - particle states and with inclusion of pairing correlations",
    ". there have been several applications  @xcite that deal with the intrinsic quadrupole mode including triaxial deformations , which is in most cases the dominant low - lying collective excitation mode in nuclei .",
    "there also have been studies of octupole modes @xcite and their coupling to the quadrupole mode @xcite , as well as investigations of fluctuations in pairing degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "all the studies mentioned so far have in common the fact that simultaneous symmetry restoration , if performed at all , is limited to numerically inexpensive modes , such as particle number or parity , whereas angular momentum is not restored .",
    "a simultaneous treatment of angular momentum projection and of fluctuations with respect to triaxial quadrupole deformation requires that five degrees of freedom be considered .",
    "the most transparent representation consists of three euler angles defining the relative orientation of the intrinsic major axis frame in the laboratory frame and two independent degrees of freedom characterizing the intrinsic deformation ( e.g. , through the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 introduced by  .",
    "bohr ) . in the context of the gcm",
    ", however , this has so far only been done in highly schematic models , by using either a single-@xmath4 shell @xcite or a very small shell model space and a schematic interaction @xcite .",
    "a first step toward the simultaneous treatment of these five degrees of freedom has been carried out recently with the gcm mixing of angular - momentum projected quadrupole - deformed axial mean - field states .",
    "this scheme is nowadays routinely applied by several groups , using skyrme energy density functionals @xcite , the density - dependent gogny force @xcite , or a relativistic point - coupling model @xcite . in all of those cases ,",
    "intrinsic triaxiality is neglected and two of the three euler angles can be treated analytically .",
    "all the studies mentioned so far that consider angular momentum projection have in common the fact that this operation is performed after variation .",
    "this has several drawbacks @xcite , in particular when working with time - reversal invariant mean - field states .",
    "the alternative , variation after projection , is computationally very demanding .",
    "the only standard method where variation after angular - momentum projection is considered ( together with restoation of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and parity ) is the vampir / monster approach @xcite which is confined to a very small shell model space and a shell model effective hamiltonian . in this framework , the intrinsic dynamics is not described in terms of deformation degrees of freedom , but rather in terms of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "an approximate scheme to describe five - dimensional quadrupole dynamics in a fully microscopic framework has been set up long ago .",
    "the idea is to construct the input of the bohr - hamiltonian microscopically @xcite .",
    "this is an approximation to the full five - dimensional gcm as it replaces the nonlocal kernels entering the hill - wheeler - griffin equation for nonorthogonal weight functions by local potentials and mass parameters in a collective schrdinger equation for orthogonal collective wave functions , but it also allows one to incorporate improved moments of inertia at a moderate cost .",
    "this approach has routinely been used for a long time in the framework of the density - dependent gogny force @xcite , and it has also been recently set up for skyrme interactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a first step toward a microscopic treatment of triaxial quadrupole dynamics and of angular momentum projection in the context of nuclear energy density functional methods using the full space of occupied single - particle states .",
    "th emethod employed generalizes that described in refs .",
    "@xcite by allowing for the breaking of axial symmetry of the mean - field wave functions .",
    "for a given nucleus , the calculations are performed in three steps .",
    "first , a nonorthogonal basis of self - consistent mean - field states is generated with constrained hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations .",
    "second , angular - momentum and particle - number projected matrix elements between all mean - field states are calculated .",
    "third , these matrix elements are used in a configuration - mixing calculation to determine the correlated ground state , the spectrum of excited states , and the transition moments    the only inputs to the calculation are the proton and neutron number and the parameters of a universal energy functional .",
    "the latter are taken from the literature and obtained from a global fit to nuclear properties aiming at the description of the entire chart of nuclei , without local fine tuning .",
    "one consistency requirement of our method is that the same effective interaction is used to generate the mean - field states and to calculate the configuration mixing .",
    "we chose a skyrme energy functional supplemented by the coulomb interaction in the mean - field channel , together with a zero - range , density - dependent functional in the pairing channel .",
    "we will give here , and in the appendix , only a sketch of the ingredients of the method .",
    "we postpone a detailed description to a future paper on the generalization of the code to time - reversal invariance breaking triaxial states .",
    "the hfb equations are solved self - consistently with the two - basis method of ref .",
    "the quadrupole moment is constrained through two coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which are related to the usual mass quadrupole deformations @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the bohr hamiltonian through the relations @xcite : @xmath9 with @xmath10 where @xmath11 fm .",
    "a mesh of positive values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 covers the entire first sextant of the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "the mean - field equations are solved on a three - dimensional mesh  , with the total nuclear density imposed to be symmetric with respect to three planes .",
    "thus , all odd-@xmath12 moments of the density identically vanish whereas the even moments , which are not constrained , are fully taken into account and take the values that minimize the energy .",
    "all the wave functions that we consider are , therefore , restricted to have positive parity .    for the results described in the following ,",
    "the mean - field wave functions are required to be time - reversal invariant , such that the collective coordinates can be limited to one sextant of the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane .",
    "the five other sextants correspond to one or several permutations of the principle axes of inertia . after projection and configuration mixing ,",
    "all of them are equivalent , although intermediate ( nonobservable ) quantities might differ .",
    "this equivalence will be used as a test of the numerical implementation of our method of sec .",
    "restoring symmetries allows to extract states with good quantum numbers from the mean - field states and provides a clean framework to use selection rules for electromagnetic transitions .",
    "eigenstates of the particle - number operator are obtained in the same way as previously  @xcite . from a technical point of view , it is crucial to restore this symmetry when mixing wave functions that are not eigenstates of the particle - number operators .",
    "since those wave functions have only the right mean particle number , their transition matrix elements will contain nondiagonal contributions in the number of particles .",
    "one can estimate easily the error that this symmetry breaking brings to energies .",
    "the binding energy per nucleon of most nuclei is between 7 and 8  mev / u and a deviation of the particle number of a mixed state as small as 0.1 nucleons would affect its energy by several hundreds of kev .",
    "particle - number projection removes this ambiguity @xcite .",
    "a technically simpler approximate method would be to introduce a constraint on the average value of the particle number @xmath13 of the mixed states in the hill - wheeler - griffin equation @xcite , but since the same value for this constraint has to be used for all the eigenstates to maintain their orthogonality , the error on the mean number of particles will vary from one state to another .",
    "we always project on the proton and neutron numbers imposed on the mean - field wave functions by lagrange multipliers in the mean - field equations .",
    "we , therefore , drop any reference to particle numbers for the sake of simple notation .",
    "angular momentum projection is significantly more complicated when triaxial mean - field states instead of axial ones are considered .",
    "eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator in the laboratory frame , @xmath14 , and its projection on the @xmath15 axis , @xmath16 , with eigenvalues and @xmath17 , respectively , are obtained by applying the operator @xmath18 where is the rotation operator and @xmath19 a wigner function$ ] , @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath21 $ ] . in any case , for systems with integer @xmath22 values as discussed here , the integration over @xmath23 $ ] of either @xmath24 or @xmath3 gives just a factor of 1 .",
    "@xmath25 picks the component with angular momentum projection @xmath1 along the intrinsic @xmath15 axis . the projected state is then obtained by summing over all @xmath1 components of the mean - field state @xmath26 , @xmath27 with weights @xmath28 determined by minimizing the energy  @xcite ( see the following ) .",
    "the number of values that the index @xmath29 can take is restricted by the symmetries of the mean - field states  @xcite ( signature with respect to @xmath30 and time - reversal invariance ) to @xmath31 for even @xmath22 values and @xmath32 for odd @xmath22 values .",
    "note that @xmath33 is not a projector in the strict mathematical sense , but it has the properties @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite .      the fluctuations of the intrinsic deformation and the resulting spreading of the nuclear states in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane can be described by a superposition of angular - momentum projected states using the two intrinsic quadrupole degrees of freedom @xmath36 as generator coordinates .",
    "taking into account that one has also to mix all @xmath1 values for each deformation , one obtains a resulting wave function given by @xmath37 this corresponds to the discretized version of the gcm .",
    "@xmath38 is a weight function of the @xmath1 components of the angular - momentum projected states of intrinsic deformation @xmath36 , determined from @xmath39 which leads to the hill - wheeler - griffin ( hwg ) equation @xcite @xmath40       \\ ; f^{j}_{\\nu } ( k',q ' ) = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the energy and norm kernels @xmath41 for the sake of simple notation , we have introduced the method using a hamilton operator @xmath42 .",
    "we shall comment on the procedure used to calculate the hamiltonian kernels from an energy density functional , and discuss some problems this may cause in sec .",
    "[ sect : mredf ] .",
    "the dimension of the variational space is considerably increased by introducing triaxial deformation .",
    "one can not limit the angular momentum projection to @xmath43 , and several @xmath1 components for each deformation have to be mixed .",
    "this has to be done with some care because of the high redundancy of the gcm bases , in the @xmath1 space for a given deformation on the one hand and also for the whole set of deformations on the other hand .",
    "for an efficient elimination of redundant states we have chosen a four - step procedure .",
    "we start from a basis @xmath44 .",
    "first , we restrict the subspace for each deformation @xmath36 and angular momentum @xmath22 by diagonalizing the norm kernel @xmath45 , rewritten in its significant subspace  @xcite , and neglecting eigenstates with negligible eigenvalues , typically smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "second , we solve the hwg equation in @xmath1 space within this new basis .",
    "the solutions @xmath47 are labeled by an index @xmath29 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : jmkappaq ] ) . the number of values that @xmath29 can take for a given @xmath22 depends on the deformation .",
    "it is just one for axial states and even @xmath22 values and is usually larger for triaxial deformation . in a third step , we transform all matrix elements to the new basis @xmath48 and diagonalize the norm matrix @xmath49 in the combined @xmath29 and @xmath36 space . once more , only significant eigenvectors of the norm matrix are retained .",
    "finally , the hamiltonian kernel is diagonalized in the basis of norm eigenstates to construct the weight functions @xmath50 .",
    "the final eigenstates @xmath51 , eq .  ( [ eq : j : gcm ] ) , mix all @xmath1 and @xmath36 values .",
    "they are then used to calculate all observables and transition moments .",
    "note that our method is not restricted to the choice of the triaxial quadrupole moment as a generator coordinate .",
    "this choice is suggested by the importance of quadrupole correlations in nuclei , but any other collective variable associated with an even multipole moment could be additionally considered , at the expense of having a larger mean - field basis .",
    "inncluding odd multipoles , in particular octupole deformations , would require a relatively simple generalization of the codes but can not be considered at present .",
    "however , some modes not related to a shape degree of freedom , such as pairing vibrations , can be included without modification of the numerics , as done earlier without angular momentum projection in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once the hwg equation is solved and the weight functions @xmath52 are known , the expectation values and transition moments of other observables @xmath53 can be determined starting from the kernels @xmath54 of the corresponding operators . some of them provide a good test of the accuracy of symmetry restoration , which can be used to determine a sufficient number of points for projection .",
    "the matrix elements of the proton and neutron number operators , for example , are equal to the required values with an absolute deviation lower than @xmath55 , and they have a dispersion lower than @xmath55 when using a nine - point formula for the particle - number projection .",
    "the symmetries of the unrotated time - reversal invariant hfb states ( time reversal and triaxiality ) permit the reduction of the integration intervals for euler angles to @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] , and @xmath58 $ ] ( i.e. , 1/16 of the full @xmath59 integration volume for systems with integer spin ) .",
    "the integrals over @xmath24 and @xmath3 are discretized with a trapezoidal rule , while for @xmath2 we employ gauss - legendre quadrature .",
    "the number of points in these intervals used for the results reported in the following is 6 for @xmath24 , 18 for @xmath2 , and 12 for @xmath3 , which corresponds to 24 , 36 , 24 points in the full @xmath59 integration volume necessary for integer @xmath22 values . with this discretization , the calculated expectation values of the angular momentum operators @xmath14 and @xmath16 are accurate with an error of the order @xmath60 for the values of @xmath22 discussed here .",
    "since the restoration of rotational symmetry provides wave functions in the laboratory frame of reference , one can compute directly the expectation values and transition matrix elements of electromagnetic operators . besides mean - square radii and @xmath61 transition moments ,",
    "we calculate spectroscopic quadrupole moments and @xmath62 values as well as magnetic moments and @xmath63 values . by combining projection and variational gcm mixing of states with different mass quadrupole moments , the @xmath62 transition moments for in - band and out - of - band transitions",
    "take the form @xmath64 and the spectroscopic quadrupole moments are given by @xmath65 the matrix elements of the electric quadrupole moment operator @xmath66 that enter the @xmath62 values and @xmath67 are calculated by using point protons with their bare electric charge @xmath68 .",
    "this approach is justified by the following considerations .",
    "first , there is no empirical evidence that electric moments are significantly modified by the in - medium effects that are absorbed into the effective energy functional but ignored for all other observables .",
    "second , we use the entire space of occupied single - particle states without assuming an inert core .",
    "third , the projected gcm , as a `` horizontal expansion '' @xcite of large - amplitude dynamics , can be formulated such that the calculation of matrix elements does not contain a sum over unoccupied states @xcite .",
    "the absence of effective charges is an important feature of a method aiming at a universal description of nuclei .",
    "the ( at least approximate ) folding with the intrinsic charge distribution of protons and neutrons to construct a charge density is important for radii @xcite , but it plays no role for multipole moments when accepting the current precision of our approach .    both the @xmath62 and @xmath67 values scale with mass and angular momentum . with triaxial shapes",
    ", however , on can no longer define a dimensionless intrinsic deformation @xmath69 that corresponds to a single @xmath67 or a single @xmath62 value , as can be done in the axial case @xcite , as one needs two independent observables ( i.e. , that are not within the same band ) to determine the deformation @xmath69 and the angle @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similarly , magnetic moments are given by @xmath70 and @xmath63 values are obtained as @xmath71 the magnetic dipole operator @xmath72 entering both expressions is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the total orbital and spin operators for protons and neutrons , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the @xmath80 factors of protons and neutrons in units of the nuclear magneton @xmath81 . unlike the electric moments , the spin contribution to the magnetic moments is modified by the physics of short - range correlations which is resummed into the energy functional but not explicitly considered in the wave functions .",
    "the spin @xmath80 factors are often quenched by an empirical factor to mock up these effects . in the present paper ,",
    "we start with time - reversal invariant mean - field states for which the spins of conjugated states exactly cancel each other .",
    "although this is no longer the case after mixing such states , particularly when projecting on angular momentum , the angular - momentum projected total spin @xmath82 , remains a small correction of a few percent to the dominating collective contribution from orbital angular momentum when calculating the @xmath15 component of total angular momentum in the laboratory frame , @xmath83 .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , we can ignore the subtlety of in - medium corrections to the spin @xmath80 factors for time being .",
    "however , when projecting and mixing cranked states at high spin or @xmath84-quasiparticle states that might have significant open spin , this point will deserve more attention .",
    "second , the magnetic moments calculated for the projected and mixed states discussed in the present paper will be very close to the expectation value of the proton orbital angular momentum @xmath85 in nuclear magnetons .",
    "the matrix elements that are needed to solve the hwg equation and to calculate the electromagnetic properties of the gcm eigenstates are matrix elements of tensor operators @xmath86 of rank @xmath87 between particle - number and angular - momentum projected states @xmath88 . as at present",
    "we consider only operators that commute with the particle - number operator , the particle - number projector for the left state can be commuted with @xmath86 and one only has to project the right state on particle number .",
    "the angular - momentum projection operator , however , does not commute with tensor operators of rank different from zero . still , the commutator can be evaluated using angular - momentum algebra to obtain matrix elements with an angular - momentum projection operator acting on the left state only : @xmath89 for a scalar operator @xmath90 , this simplifies to @xmath91 as a consequence , we have to evaluate matrix elements of the form @xmath92 where @xmath26 and @xmath93 are hfb states with possibly different intrinsic deformations , and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the hfb states rotated in coordinate and gauge space , respectively .",

    "the terms in the skyrme edf that contain time - odd densities are treated as described in appendix  c of ref .",
    "@xcite and give a small contribution to the nondiagonal kernels .",
    "the density - dependent terms are generalized by using the standard prescription that the density is replaced by the transition density in the density - dependent terms .",
    "this is the only prescription that guarantees various consistency requirements of the energy functional @xcite .",

    "discontinuities or even divergences of the energy kernel may indeed appear as a function of deformation . a regularization scheme has been proposed @xcite and applied to a simple case of mr - edf calculations @xcite .",

    "first , the coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath3 are not related to any matrix element in the angular - momentum projected energy surfaces but merely provide a label for the intrinsic state fromwhich the projected energy is obtained .",
    "all states projected on @xmath96 are spherical in the laboratory frame .",
    "second , neither the mean - field nor the projected states are orthogonal , such that the energy maps do not and can not represent the actual metric , which is related to the inverse of the respective overlap matrix . finally , the @xmath98 , @xmath99 surface depends on the orientation chosen for the principal axes of the nucleus .",
    "the quadrupole moment along the @xmath15 axis is the largest one in fig .",
    "[ fig : map : j00 ] .",
    "we shall show later that the @xmath99 results have no obvious interpretation for other choices .    starting with the energy surface without angular - momentum projection",
    ", one sees that the mean - field ground state corresponds to an axial prolate deformation , more bound than the spherical configuration by about 700  kev . comparing with the axial energy curve given as a solid line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nilsson : ax ] , one notices that the prolate minimum is indeed a true one but that the oblate extremum seen in fig .",

    "@xcite and in hfb calculations with the gogny force d1 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the projection on @xmath96 favors triaxial configurations : the lowest energy is obtained for a triaxial mean - field configuration with @xmath101 and a value for @xmath69 around 0.6 , similar to that of the axial mean - field state giving the lowest @xmath96 projected energy . before projection , these two states were separated by 2.2  mev .",
    "the energy gain for the triaxial point is 3.1  mev larger than that of the axial point .",
    "this difference is thus large enough to compensate for the difference in energy between the mean - field configurations .",
    "however , this result has to be taken _ cum grano salis _ as the deformation has a limited meaning after projection . in particular , the states resulting from the projection on the same @xmath22 value of mean - field configurations corresponding to different quadrupole moments may have a large overlap .",
    "the states with the lowest energy obtained after projection of axial and triaxial configurations have an overlap close to 0.9 .",
    "@xmath0 is one of the few light nuclei with a deformed mean - field ground state when pairing correlations are taken into account . in this small system , however , the static quadrupole correlation energy ( i.e. , the deformation energy of the mean - field ground state ) is much smaller than the dynamical quadrupole correlation energy obtained from projection and mixing of states with different intrinsic shapes ; this is a general feature of light nuclei with @xmath102 @xcite .",

    "however , further improvements are still necessary , including the breaking of time - reversal invariance and the consideration of the projection of cranking states optimized for each angular momentum .",
    "the breaking of axiality is a necessary first step before the breaking of time - reversal invariance and we hope to validate the extension of our method in this case in the near future . * the power of our method will be more apparent when breaking of time - reversal invariance is included .",
    "although some new states can already be described at the present level of development ( e.g. , odd-@xmath22 members of @xmath193 bands ) , it will be possible to describe quasiparticle excitations and in particular nuclei with an odd number of neutrons or protons .",
    "* our method also provides an ideal tool to benchmark simpler models . to give only one example",
    ", the metric of the @xmath2-@xmath3-plane is generated directly in our method by the overlaps between mean - field wave functions of different shapes .",
    "although it is not trivial to derive this metric in a multidimensional problem , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the one - dimensional case , it would be very instructive to compare a metric derived from a purely microscopic approach to the metrics that are usually based on semiclassical approximations .",
    "there are no basic reasons that prevent the application of the method presented here to heavy nuclei , although this would be too time consuming with our current numerical implementation .",
    "further developments are required to improve the efficiency of the numerical algorithms .",
    "in particular , the choice of discretization points used to evaluate the integrals over the euler angles needs to be optimized and the codes have to be parallelized , which could be done in a very efficient way .",
    "work in that direction is underway .",
    "another development that will have to be completed in the near future is the implementation of the regularization scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to remove the pathologies brought by the use of the generalized wick theorem when evaluating the energy kernels starting from an energy density functional .",
    "however , the conceptual and technical difficulties encountered in the present generalization of the projected gcm justify the continuation of the present developments in parallel .",
    "considerable work at the level of the computational algorithm still remains to be performed to have a method applicable to heavy nuclei .",

    "the mean - field states are generated with a simplified version of the cranked hfb code whose evolution is documented in refs .  @xcite .",
    "we have imposed time - reversal invariance of the hfb vacua such that the single - particle wave functions are pairwise connected by time reversal .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are represented as complex spinors discretized on a three - dimensional cartesian lagrange mesh in coordinate space .",
    "in addition to time reversal , two further symmetries of the @xmath194 symmetry group  @xcite are imposed on the single - particle basis , namely that they are eigenstates of the parity @xmath195 and @xmath15 signature @xmath196 .",
    "their relative phases are fixed by choosing a basis where the eigenvalue of the @xmath113 time simplex @xmath197 is @xmath198 for all single - particle states .",
    "this introduces three plane symmetries and allows us to restrict the numerical representation of individual wave functions to 1/8 of a full box  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the single - particle states are chosen to have good isospin projection ( i.e. , they are either pure proton or neutron states ) .",
    "mean - field states with different deformation are obtained adding constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath8 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) in the variation .",
    "the constrained hfb equations are solved by using the `` two - basis method '' described in ref .",
    "@xcite , which delivers the hfb states @xmath26 through quite a small number of single - particle states represented in coordinate space in the so - called hartree - fock ( hf ) basis that diagonalizes the single - particle hamiltonian and the corresponding @xmath199 and @xmath200 matrices that establish the general bogoliubov transformation @xcite from the hf basis to the quasiparticle basis that diagonalizes the quasiparticle hamiltonian .",
    "this procedure permits to limit the numerical representation to all single - particle levels below the fermi energy and to a small number of levels above . as done in our earlier configuration - mixing calculations",
    ", we add the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) prescription to the hfb equations to enforce pairing correlations in all mean - field states .",
    "using states without pairing in a gcm calculation introduces the danger of artificially decoupling many - body states with a different ratio of occupied single - particle states of positive and negative parity , which can lead to instabilities when solving the hwg equation  ( [ eq : hwg : full ] ) .",
    "the representation of the single - particle states on a coordinate space mesh has the clear advantage that its precision is fairly independent of the deformation when a sufficiently large box is chosen , and it only depends on the distance of discretization points .",
    "this is important for gcm calculations mixing states with very different deformation .",
    "for the subsequent projection and mixing of hfb states with different shapes , it is advantageous to use the canonical single - particle bases of the mean - field states as starting point .",
    "this simplifies the corresponding @xmath199 and @xmath200 matrices and allows for a safe cutoff of single - particle states with very small occupation @xmath201 that do not contribute to any of the kernels . for the identification of symmetries of the integrals over euler angles",
    ", it also turns out to be advantageous to transform the single - particle basis to a basis of eigenstates of @xmath30 signature @xmath202 .",
    "the rotation of the `` left '' state in coordinate space and the `` right '' state in gauge space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : melr ] ) , can be performed either as rotations of the canonical single - particle states leaving the corresponding @xmath199 and @xmath200 matrices untouched or as rotations of the @xmath199 and @xmath200 matrices leaving the single - particle states untouched . for the coordinate space rotation ,",
    "the latter is equivalent to the expansion of the rotated single - particle states in terms of the unrotated ones , which already at moderate deformation requires highly excited single - particle states above the fermi energy , which are outside of the single - particle basis used to describe the unrotated state .",
    "therefore , the coordinate space rotation @xmath203 is performed as a rotation of the single - particle states on the mesh as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , which , however , is the most time - consuming piece of the numerical calculations . in contrast , it is simpler and numerically more efficient to perform the gauge - space rotation as a transformation of the @xmath200 matrices instead of the single - particle basis , which in the canonical basis boils down to the multiplication of a small antidiagonal matrix with a phase factor .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath203 mixes single - particle states of both signatures , which requires one to extend the numerical representation of the single - particle wave functions from 1/8 to 1/2 of the full box , leaving only parity ( and the isospin projection ) as a good quantum number .",
    "the symmetries of the unrotated time - reversal invariant hfb states , however , permit the reduction of the integration intervals for euler angles to @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 $ ] , and @xmath58 $ ] ( i.e. , 1/16 of the full @xmath59 integration volume for systems with integer spin ) .",
    "rotating an hfb state in coordinate or gauge space gives back an hfb state ; hence , the matrix elements between `` left '' and `` right '' states , eq .  ( [ eq : melr ] ) , can be easily evaluated with the generalized wick theorem @xcite .",
    "the expressions given in refs .",
    "@xcite can not be directly used , however .",
    "first , we have to transform the contractions between states in different quasiparticle bases to expressions for contraction between states in different canonical single - particle bases @xcite .",
    "second , our coordinate space representation has as a consequence that the single - particle bases that set up @xmath26 and @xmath93 are not equivalent , a difficulty that is amplified further by rotation of one of the states .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by eliminating the contribution to the kernels coming from single - particle states that are occupied in one of the bases but not in the other should be replaced by @xmath204 , which does not have any consequences for these papers as the matrix @xmath205 is real with the symmetries chosen there . ]",
    "@xcite .",
    "the integrals over the gauge angles for projection on proton and neutron number are discretized with the fomenko prescription @xcite , which is equivalent to a trapezoidal rule . by using the number parity of the mean - field states ,",
    "the integration intervals can be reduced to @xmath206 $ ] for protons and neutrons .",
    "additionally , a symmetry connects the basic contractions and overlap in the interval @xmath207 $ ] with those in @xmath208 $ ] , which , however , can not be used to reduce the integration intervals for the reasons outlined in the appendix of ref .",

    "its modulus is determined by the onishi formula @xcite .",
    "its phase , a rapidly varying oscillatory function of the gauge angle of particle - number projection , has to be determined from continuity arguments . its value is zero for the overlap between non - gauge - space - rotated states and is followed during the gauge - space rotation by performing a second - order taylor expansion . to this end ,",
