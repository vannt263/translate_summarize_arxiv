    "the foundation of the ising model became an very important event in the modern physics .",
    "it was the basic tool explaining critical temperatures for which phase transitions occur in physical systems ( see domb et al  @xcite ) .",
    "it is one of the most studied models with wide range of applications in different sciences .",
    "weidlich used ising model to explain the polarization phenomena in sociology .",
    "it also has been adapted in economics to explain the diffusion of technical innovations .",
    "new technologies were stated as the result of the interaction with neighboring firms . into general equilibrium economics ising model",
    "was introduced by fllmer  @xcite .",
    "there are several sources of influence on the price of the stock . one important component is real firm data ; another one , correlation between amount of buyers and sellers .",
    "the action of each trader ( he is a buyer or seller ) was taken as the value of the trader .",
    "kaizoji  @xcite introduced an ising - type model of speculative activity , which explain bubbles and crashes in stock market .",
    "he introduced the market - maker , who adjusts the price on the market in dependence of correlation of the buyers and sellers .",
    "after curie had discovered the critical temperature , weiss developed a theory of ferromagnetism based on a spin system .",
    "it appears by replacement of the nearest - neighbor pairs interacting of the ising model by assumption that each spin variable interacts with each other spin variable at any site of the lattice with exactly the same strength .",
    "some space - time models have been suggested .",
    "one model based on the ising model , was suggested by jrpe  @xcite .",
    "the partition function of the model contains two hamiltonians , one of which describes previous moment of the time .",
    "this model may be used for describing volatility clustering on the market .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a new space - time model , which is also describes the volatility clustering without assumptions about the structure of the lattice .",
    "today information about trading on the markets is available , e.g.  in internet , to everyone . since there is less space restrictions for this reason it motivates creating a space - time model baced on the curie - weiss model .",
    "such a model is formally defined in this paper , and some results about critical temperature of the market is derived according to the distribution of the hamiltonian in this model .    in section  [ sec_meth ]",
    "the model and methods which are used are described . in section  [ sec_res ]",
    "all main results are presented .",
    "the implications are discussed in section  [ sec_disc ] .",
    "the model which is introduced in this paper is based on two models .",
    "the first is the curie - weiss model , which is a simple modification of the ising model .",
    "it allows all agents in the system to interact with each other with a constant strength .",
    "the second model is the spatio - temporal model of jrpe  @xcite which possesses both spatial and time dependence .",
    "the state of a site in a lattice is depending on the states of its nearest neighbors and on the global degree of clustering of the previous pattern .",
    "we took from the curie - weiss model the idea of the global interaction and from the model of jrpe the structure of the partition function and obtained a new space - time model which is appropriate for describing the volatility clustering on the market .",
    "let us consider a market which contains @xmath0 traders symbolically denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "in this simple model every trader in a time - period can buy a fixed amount of stock or sell the same amount . in the first case",
    "the `` trader s decision '' is @xmath2 , in the second case @xmath3 . then @xmath4 represents the investment attitude of the market .",
    "all traders are neighbors .",
    "that means that each trader knows about the `` trader s decisions '' of all others traders , so his decision is under influence of the others .",
    "a configuration of the model is a specification of `` trader s decisions '' of all traders of the market . with each configuration",
    "@xmath5 a hamiltonian or interaction energy , @xmath6 is connected . we will consider this hamltonian without investment environment .",
    "let @xmath7 be the probability of observing the state @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an enumeration of the distinct states of @xmath10 .",
    "obviously we have that @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "further we assume that all states @xmath13 are possible ( i.e @xmath14 ) .",
    "now , wanting to minimize the entropy we have an optimization problem of minimizing @xmath15 with respect to measure @xmath16 .",
    "suppose that the energy of each configuration @xmath17 has been determined .",
    "the probability , @xmath16 , that the system has configuration @xmath13 with energy @xmath18 if the configuration at the privious moment of time is given is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a partition function and @xmath21 is the market temperature describing the strenght of interaction between the traders .",
    "the statistic @xmath22 is minimal sufficient for inference about the temperature paramter conditional on the previous state , @xmath23 .",
    "the behavior of the system in the curie - weiss model is described by the equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents magnetization of the configuration .",
    "this equation allows us to obtain the property of the temperature of the market and the critical value of the temperature .",
    "we will use the method of hartmann and weigt   to obtain the equation of the behavior of new model .",
    "the equation of the behavior of the system for the new model is @xmath26    the critical temperature of the new model is @xmath27 . for @xmath28",
    "the model @xmath29 is stationary in the space - time sense . for @xmath30 ,",

    "when @xmath34 the partition function has the form @xmath35 we know the function @xmath36 and the form of the @xmath37 is deduced from @xmath38 implying that @xmath39 @xmath40 therefore @xmath41    since the hamiltonian @xmath18 is sufficient for the temperature parameter , we are interested in obtaining the distribution of the hamiltonian . testing for dependence will make a null hypothisis assuming independence , and thus we first consider the distribution of @xmath18 assuming @xmath42 .",
    "we are interested in analysis of dependence between @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "let the variables @xmath46 be independent of each other and take their values in @xmath47 with equal probability @xmath48",
    ". then all non - identical pairwise products are independent , i.e.  @xmath49 if @xmath50 or @xmath51 for any dimension @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a model where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are decisions of the traders .",
    "for every trader the probability of their decision to buy or sell is @xmath48 unconditional of the other traders .",
    "now , let us consider the set of values of the mean field @xmath54 .",
    "for this we have the state space @xmath55 meaning that @xmath56 can be in @xmath57 states .",
    "consider now values of @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath0 is even , then one value of @xmath56 is 0 and @xmath59 which is to say that @xmath58 could be in @xmath60 different states .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd , then 0 is not a value of @xmath56 and @xmath61 and in that case @xmath58 could be any of @xmath62 states .    regarding the hamiltonian @xmath63 we consequently the statespace of @xmath18 @xmath64 in the case when @xmath0 is even .",
    "if @xmath0 is odd we get @xmath65    if @xmath66 and @xmath46 are independent , then @xmath67 , where @xmath68 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath69 when @xmath70 are independent is @xmath71      let us now consider the case when the decisions of the traders are not independent .",
    "the distribution of @xmath69 when @xmath70 are not independent is @xmath72      from now on we consider the space - time process @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "then we have a corresponding sequence of mean fields , @xmath75 where @xmath76 , and of hamiltonians , @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    "we obtained the exact distribution of the statistic @xmath94 .",
    "now let us calculate this distribution in the case with 10 traders .",
    "we wrote a program in the r language of programming which calculates the probability of all possible configurations of the system containing @xmath0 traders , by determining the value of the hamiltonian for each configuration and build the matrix vec of dimensions @xmath95 where the first line contains all possible values of @xmath18 , the second line : the number of the configurations that leads to the corresponding value in the first line , the third : probability of corresponding value from the first line . in figure  [ fig_exact_distr ]",
    "we can see the distribution of @xmath18 for @xmath96 .",

    "the value of the test statistic in this case is @xmath98 this means that we can not reject the hypothesis of independence on level 5% of significance ( or any lower level ) . as a matter of fact",
    "the @xmath99-value of @xmath100 in this case is @xmath101 so dependence can not be proved on any reasonable level of significance .",
    "in this thesis we investigated a new space - time model for interacting agents in the financial market .",
    "first we reviewed the history of the ising model and some other ising - type models .",
    "then the ising model , curie - weiss model and some modifications of these models were formally presented .",
    "also we considered one way of finding the critical temperature of the market .",
    "a new space - time model was developed and necessary and sufficient conditions for its stationarity were found .",
    "the non - linear sensitivity of market global properties in terms of temperature parameter changes was investigated .",
    "the critical temperature for this model was analytically derived .",
    "the distribution of the hamiltonian was analyzed using its dependence with the magnetization of the market and the exact distribution was calculated .",
    "the conditional expectation and variance of the hamiltonian were found and the stationary distribution was obtained .",
    "then the exact distribution of the hamiltonian for 10 traders was calculated , and the expected distribution was confirmed .",
    "hypothesis test for independence between agents was considered for the swedish steel market and it showed that there is no evident critical situation on the market at the time of this dataset .",
    "the parameter reflects how strongly traders are influenced by each other in the market .",
    "it can signalize risk for a crash or a bubble in the market .",
    "therefore it is very important that its analysis is accurate in such situations . what remains for future work ?",
    "we could try a lot of real data and compare inferential results relying on this model to observable quantities generally accepted as a measure of health of the situation on the market .",
    "also we can consider a bigger ammount of traders to have a more exact @xmath99-value in the hypothesis testing .",
    "then we can estimate the amount of interaction for our model using e.g. maximum likelihood estimator .",
    "here exists also the possibility to develop hypothesis testing based on a time dependent model . also interesting to find out how good this model is to explain volatility clustering .",
