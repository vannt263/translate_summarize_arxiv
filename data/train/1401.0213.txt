    "the collisions of relativistic heavy ions have total cross sections as large as hundreds of barns , primarily due to bound - free pair production ( bfpp ) and electro - magnetic dissociation ( emd ) .",
    "these cross sections have been previously calculated for the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "secondary beams created by bfpp can limit the lhc heavy ion luminosity since they have a different charge - to - mass ratio than the primary beam and can be lost in cryogenically cooled magnets . the heat generated due to this loss can quench these magnets , when exceeding a threshold .",
    "localized beam losses of a secondary beam generated by bfpp were observed in rhic with cu+cu collisions  @xcite .",
    "the secondary beams generated in au+au and u+u collisions in rhic are within the transverse momentum aperture but outside the longitudinal acceptance of the radio frequency ( rf ) buckets .",
    "these secondary beams are eventually lost , but not in the same turn .    in 2012 rhic",
    "operated for the first time with uranium ions , which have a prolate shape .",
    "such collisions are interesting for several reasons .",
    "collisions of uranium ions along their long axis can potentially create a quark - gluon plasma even denser than that from collisions of the more spherical gold ions .",
    "central collisions of uranium ions with the long axes parallel create elliptic flow  @xcite of secondary particles , but without the magnetic field generated by the ions passing each other when the elliptic flow is generated through partial overlap of the ions .    in uranium - uranium operation  @xcite with a low - loss magnetic lattice  @xcite and 3-dimensional stochastic cooling in store  @xcite",
    ", the beam loss of a well - tuned machine can be almost entirely attributed to luminous processes . in this situation",
    "the total cross section can be obtained from the observed beam loss rates .    in the following we present the calculations for the total u+u cross section for the rhic operating energy , the main features of the u+u operation during 2012 , the methodology for determining the total cross section experimentally , and the experimental result .",
    "the calculated u+u cross sections at rhic are shown in tab .  [",
    "tab : xsec ] together with the rhic au+au and lhc pb+pb cross sections .",
    "the largest contributions to these cross sections come not from the nuclear overlap of the colliding ions , but from two electromagnetic processes , bound - electron free - positron pair ( bfpp ) production and electromagnetic dissociation ( emd ) of the nucleus .",
    "bound - electron free - positron pair production changes the charge of the ion causing it to fall out of the beam .",
    "electromagnetic dissociation removes at least one neutron from the ion , changing its mass and likewise causing it to fall out of the beam .",
    "since the total u+u cross section measured here is obtained from beam loss rates , processes that do not lead to beam loss are obviously not included in the calculated cross sections . at rhic energies the infinite range elastic coulomb scattering cross section does not cause any notable deviation in the beam trajectories .",
    "the u+u cross section for free electron positron pairs in this experiment is huge , 64  kb calculated with the perturbative formula of racah  @xcite ( a formula which agrees very well with recent numerical calculations and is much more accurate than the formula of landau and lifschitz  @xcite ) .",
    "for au+au at rhic the corresponding perturbative cross section is 36  kb .",
    "however , these free pair cross sections are almost completely dominated by soft pairs , where the ions remain intact , and they do not contribute to the present measured total cross section .",
    "the calculated bfpp cross section for the process @xmath1 is listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : xsec ] .",
    "they are derived from the paper of meier , halabuka , hencken , trautmann , and baur  @xcite . in this work exact dirac wave functions",
    "are used for final state bound electrons , and higher shell states are included .",
    "exact coulomb distorted dirac wave functions are also used for the final state continuum positrons .",
    "calculations are perturbative , and semi - classical straight line trajectories are assumed for the ions .",
    "however , higher order effects should be small : exact calculations have been done in the ultra - relativistic limit for rhic au+au , and they show a modest reduction on the order of 3% from perturbation theory in the bfpp cross section to the dominant lowest electron bound 1s - state  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections calculated in  @xcite are compared in that paper with other calculations in the literature and found to be in good agreement . because of the thoroughness and the convenient presentation of the results in a useful form , we consider the  @xcite results the current state of the art for bfpp calculations",
    ".    .calculated total cross sections for au+au and u+u collisions in rhic , and pb+pb collisions in the lhc .",
    "the total cross section is given by the sum of bfpp , single emd , and nuclear cross sections .",
    "the mutual emd cross section is given for reference only . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the pct calibration is typically performed at the beginning of the running period and the question is by how much the calibration parameters can vary during the run .",
    "we have already considered the temperature effect above . here",
    "we list other sources of errors that can affect the calibration taken from the specifications found in the pct user manual :    * linearity error @xmath2% @xmath3 zero error * zero drift ( 1 hour ) @xmath4  @xmath5a * zero drift ( 1 year ) @xmath6  @xmath5a at constant temperature * absolute accuracy @xmath7%    we have compared some of these values with slope values for two instances where calibration parameters before and after a calibration were logged and one where calibrations were logged two days apart .",
    "we see that all the slope differences between calibrations are largest for the madc measurements which vary by an average of 0.14% when the measurements are months apart and 0.036% when they are 2 days apart .",
    "the dvm measurements are much better than could be expected from the current source specifications .",
    "independent of the digitizer used the slope values always repeat within 0.2% .      in the past",
    ", some discrepancies were observed when comparing expected dvm readings with actual readings obtained with a series of current source settings .",
    "these discrepancies were attributed to noise .",
    "such measurements were repeated .",
    "figure  [ figa1:1 ] shows the differences between expected and observed values and the quality of linear least square fit indicates that the discrepancies are mainly due to a calibration issue which is compensated for in the calibration procedure .",

    "[ tab : di ] . for those errors that were obtained in units of current , such as the temperature correction",
    ", the values were converted to percentages by using an average beam current of 28  ma , typical for the uranium beams mid - store in the experiments ( tab .",
    "[ tab : beam ] shows the values at the beginning of the store and at the time of the maximum luminosity ) .",
    "output noise contributes only 0.01% to the systematic intensity error ( tab .",
    "[ tab : di ] ) .",
    "the luminosity is measured via the detection of neutron - pair coincidences in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc )  @xcite . the effective cross section for neutron - pair coincidence detection",
    "was measured to be @xmath8  barn for phenix , and @xmath9  barn for star .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the calculated cross sections given in tab .  [",
    "tab : xsec ] .",
    "indeed , by accounting for the fact that about 97% of the emd events are accompanied by the emission of at least one neutron at each side , the value of 15.34  b is obtained as @xmath10  b , providing that forward neutrons are always emitted in nuclear collisions .",
    "a general outline of the error analysis of luminosity measurements is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the detailed analysis of the u+u luminosity error in ref .",
    "the following effects were considered in the determination of the luminosity error : ( i ) the need for a double gaussian fit function for the luminosity as a function of relative beam offset , ( ii ) the total intensity measurement , ( iii ) the bunched intensity measurement , ( iv ) the fill pattern , ( v ) the relative position measurement error , ( vi ) the crossing angle .",
