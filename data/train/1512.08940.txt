    "[ fig6](e ) . in this case , only the as current contributes to the total current .",
    "the traveling electrons through the as channel and the stable electrons located in bs level make @xmath161 become the second dominant matrix element . in brief , the magnitudes of as or bs currents depend on how close the corresponding energy level and @xmath159 are .",

    "[ ] .,width=207 ]    if the ab phase dependence of the total current is half period of that of the as or bs current , the as and bs energy levels are equally close to @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the traveling electrons passing through these channels have similar contribution to the corresponding reduced density matrix elements .",
    "the magnitudes of @xmath143 and @xmath144 are close to each other in this condition ( see fig .  [ fig6](c ) ) .",
    "the larger @xmath174 makes the electrons that flow from the left lead to the right lead more sensitive on the magnetic flux , and thus gives the larger amplitudes to the reduced density matrix elements @xmath143 and @xmath144 and the corresponding currents , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where the strong interference between the @xmath143 and @xmath144 is also shown .",
    "the dqds system would have large probability to be in bonding state or antibonding state at certain @xmath15 .",
    "for example , the dqds system mainly locate in antibonding state ( bonding state ) at @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "therefore , if the strong indirect interdot coupling can be practically succeeded , it could provide an efficient way to manipulate coherence between the bonding and antibonding states through the magnetic flux . a similar scheme for dqds without direct interdot coupling has been proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] for manipulating the relative phase between the two qds . however , the direct interdot coupling can totally manipulate the energy levels of bonding and antibonding states so that we can distinguish the contributions of the corresponding channels in the transport current .",
    "in conclusion , using the quantum transport theory based on the master equation@xcite , we have justified the method used in ref .  [ ] for analysing the as and bs currents .",
    "we show that when the energy level of bs is within a quite large range near the middle of the bias window , the bs current in configuration 1 well approximates the bs current in configuration 2",
    ". however , in conditions that the temperature is high or the couplings to the environments is strong , this analysis may not be valid .",
    "this is because the bias window is broaden in high temperature and the effective transmissions of the channels become wider for the strong couplings to the leads .",
    "we also extend this current analysis through as and/or bs channels to the transient regime .",
    "we find that the analysis in ref .",
    "[ ] is still valid in the transient regime except for a short time interval from the very beginning .",
    "we also show that the ab phase dependence of these current components is mainly determined by the device geometry , and it is independent of the dynamics of the as and bs channels .",
    "furthermore , we also examine the relation between the ab phase dependence of single - electron probabilities of occupying as and bs and the corresponding currents .",
    "we find that the ab phase dependence varies in the same way under different device geometries .",
    "we also explore the ab phase dependence of the as and bs reduced density matrix elements and the corresponding currents under different as and bs energies .",
    "this provides not only the useful information for the reconstruction of quantum states through the measurement of transport current , an approach known as quantum state tomography , but also a practice way to manipulate coherence between the as and bs states with the magnetic flux , as a key for quantum information processing in quantum dot systems .",
