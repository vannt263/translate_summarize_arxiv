    "preparing a massive object in a spatial quantum superposition over distances comparable to its size is a tantalizing possibility .",
    "this has been achieved in seminal experiments on matter - wave interferometry of molecules  @xcite , which hold a mass record of @xmath1 amu  @xcite .",
    "it would be particularly intriguing to prepare large quantum superpositions of even larger masses such that one could enter into the _ gravitational quantum regime _",
    "( gqr ) , which we define as follows . for a solid sphere of radius @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 ,",
    "we define the timescale @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the planck s constant and @xmath6 the newton s gravitational constant .",
    "@xmath7 has two interpretations : ( i ) it is the conjectured lifetime of a quantum superposition state of a single sphere delocalized over a distance @xmath2 , according to the parameter - free   in the mass density is typically introduced , thereby making the model parameter - dependent . in that case the quantum superposition lifetime for a sphere of radius @xmath2 separated by a distance of the order @xmath2 would then be reduced by a factor @xmath8 , namely it would be given by @xmath9 .",
    "thus the lifetime @xmath7 discussed in the text is a parameter - free upper - bound to the lifetime predicted by gravitationally - induced collapse models .",
    "see @xcite for further details . ]",
    "gravitationally - induced decoherence collapse model proposed by disi and penrose  @xcite , ( ii ) @xmath10 is the kinetic energy of two spheres equivalent to their gravitational interaction energy when separated by a distance @xmath11 , a situation that could be used to measure @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath7 is related to the much longer timescale @xmath12 required to entangle the center - of - mass motion of two spheres spatially localized within a length scale @xmath13 and separated by a distance @xmath14 using the gravitational interaction  @xcite . for a given mass density , one can plot @xmath7 as a function of @xmath3 , see .",
    "we define the gqr as the regime in which @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a characteristic time scale of the quantum system for each of the two interpretations of @xmath7 . in particular : in ( i ) @xmath16",
    "is the coherence time of the superposition taking into account standard sources of decoherence , in ( ii ) @xmath17 could be the trap frequency of a harmonic potential where two spheres are cooled near to their respective ground states .",
    "choosing @xmath16 to be of the order of @xmath18 second , which is an ambitious timescale for quantum experiments , one sees in that @xmath19 pertains to masses @xmath20 .",
    "the goal of this article is to propose an earth - based experimental scenario that allows one to access the gqr .    preparing a large mass ( @xmath20 ) in a large quantum superposition ( comparable to its size )",
    "is an ambitious challenge that we think can be addressed via two different approaches : either the _ bottom - up approach _ , consisting in gradually increasing the mass of the object that is prepared in a large superposition , or the _ top - down approach _ , that gradually increases the delocalization distance of a large mass that is brought into the quantum regime .",
    "matter - wave interferometry has traditionally followed the bottom - up approach .",
    "starting in the 30 s with the quantum interference of single electrons , the mass of the objects that can be interfered has remarkably increased up to molecules of @xmath1  amu  @xcite .",
    "the top - down approach is more recent and has been triggered by the field of quantum nano- and micromechanics  @xcite .",
    "recent achievements in this field include bringing objects with masses ranging from @xmath21 amu to @xmath22 amu to the quantum regime by cooling their associated mechanical degree of freedom to its quantum ground state  @xcite .",
    "however , while the mass is definitely large , the delocalization distance of the ground state in such systems is typically smaller than the size of a single atom .",
    "such tiny delocalization distances prevent current quantum micromechanical oscillators to enter into the gqr , specially in the context of ( i ) .",
    "levitated mechanical oscillators , in particular optically levitated dielectric nanospheres in high finesse optical cavities  @xcite , have been suggested as an ideal nanomechanical system to implement the top - down approach by releasing the mechanically cooled nanosphere from the trap to increase the delocalization distance  @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , these all - optical hybrid schemes  @xcite using the best of matter - wave interferometry and quantum optomechanics seem , even in the most ambitious proposals requiring a space environment  @xcite , to be limited to masses between @xmath23 and @xmath21 amu , putting them still away from the gqr .    here",
    "we propose to attain spatially large quantum superpositions of masses @xmath24 amu , well inside the gqr , by abandoning the use of lasers and using instead an _ all - magnetic _ on - chip architecture .",
    "this approach combines the following salient features : ( i ) cryogenic temperatures both for environment and the massive particle to minimize decoherence due to emission , scattering , and absorption of black - body radiation , ( ii ) the use of static magnetic potentials created by persistent currents to magnetically levitate the sphere without creating decoherence ( space environment is not required ) as well as to exponentially speed - up quantum dynamics by using inverted potentials , and ( iii ) coupling the position of the sphere to quantum circuits on an integrated on - chip configuration to cool the center - of - mass motion to the ground state , to make a double - slit smaller than the size of the sphere by measuring the squared center - of - mass position , and to measure the interference pattern downstream .",
    "these tools permit , in principle , to make an all - magnetic young s double slit experiment , with a single run - time of less than a second , on - earth , with a superconducting microsphere of radius @xmath25 m , mass @xmath22  amu , and with a slit separation of half a micrometer .",
    "as discussed before , this ambitious goal could be experimentally addressed from a top - down approach by first implementing on - chip quantum magnetomechanics with superconducting microspheres  @xcite , and then progressively implementing the key ingredients of the proposal .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in",
    "we discuss the main challenges that a proposal aiming at preparing large quantum superpositions of a massive object has to overcome .",
    "the discussion of these challenges aims at motivating both the protocol and the implementation of our proposal . in",
    "we describe the quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol as well as how to analytically calculate all the steps of the protocol taking into account decoherence .",
    "this enables us to analytically obtain the interference pattern as a function of all the physical parameters of the protocol and environmental decoherence . in",
    "we propose and analyze an all - magnetic on - chip implementation of the quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol for a superconducting microsphere . in we analyze a case study with a set of experimental parameters , whose complete list is given in the appendix .",
    "while the experimental parameters have not been fine - tuned , this is an example which shows the feasibility to enter in the gravitational quantum regime such that parameter - free gravitational - induced decoherence could be unambiguously falsified .",
    "we draw our conclusions and provide some final remarks in .",
    "let us discuss three fundamental challenges that will need to be overcome by proposals aiming to prepare large superpositions of a massive object in the gqr : unavoidable decoherence , slow quantum dynamics , and the double - slit .",
    "these challenges are discussed in a general fashion without considering any particular implementation .",
    "they will serve as a motivation to introduce the quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol in   and the implementation in   that we propose to overcome them .",
    "consider a sphere of radius @xmath2 whose center - of - mass position along the @xmath26-axis is described by the quantum state @xmath27 .",
    "most sources of decoherence of the center - of - mass position are of the position localization ( pld ) type ( see , for example  @xcite ) .",
    "pld makes the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix in the position basis decay exponentially in time . in the so called long wavelength ( lw )",
    "limit , where decoherence events provide only partial which - path information , it can be shown that @xmath28 \\bra{x } \\hat \\rho(0 ) \\ket{x'}$ ] , where @xmath29 is the localization parameter . in this regime decoherence",
    "is modeled by the master equation ( t ) = - [ eq : pldecoh ] , where @xmath30 is the hamiltonian of the system . in the short wavelength",
    "( sw ) limit , where decoherence events provide a full which - path information , one has that @xmath31 \\bra{x } \\hat \\rho(0 ) \\ket{x'}$ ] .    as discussed in @xcite",
    "most of the paradigmatic collapse models predict , at the level of density matrices , a pld .",
    "in particular , the effect of the parameter - free gravitationally induced collapse model , conjectured by penrose and disi  @xcite , can be described with the lw limit of the pld with a localization parameter given by  @xcite _ g = .[eq : dplam ] here @xmath6 is the newton s gravitational constant .",
    "note that @xmath32 is parameter - free , namely , it does not depend on any phenomenological parameter , since a homogeneous mass density is assumed .",
    "as already remarked in a footnote of the introduction , such choice provides a lower bound on the gravitationally - induced decoherence rate , hence by falsifying this case all other parameter - dependent forms of gravitationally - induced decoherence would also be falsified , see  @xcite for further details",
    ". combining eqs .",
    "[ eq : pldecoh ] and [ eq : dplam ] , we can immediately see that the correlations in a spatial quantum superposition of extent @xmath2 decay as @xmath33 \\bra{r/2 } \\hat \\rho(0 ) \\ket{-r/2}$ ] , where @xmath34 is the timescale used in to define the gqr .    in order to falsify such an exotic source of decoherence , which predicts the breakdown of standard quantum mechanics",
    ", one has to account for and control the standard sources of decoherence that are expected in an implementation .",
    "we discuss the following inevitable sources of decoherence : scattering of air molecules , emission , absorption , and scattering of black - body radiation , and stochastic forces due to vibrations .",
    "decoherence due to scattering of air molecules , with a thermal wavelength typically smaller than the superposition size of interest , is described by pld in the sw limit  @xcite .",
    "the decoherence rate is given by _",
    "a = , where @xmath35 is the environmental pressure , @xmath36 is the environmental temperature , and @xmath37 is the mass of an air molecule . in order to preserve coherence , the quantum micromechanical interferometer should be implemented in a time @xmath38 , namely , it is required that the sphere does not scatter any air molecules during each run of the protocol . for a sphere of @xmath39 in an optimal cryogenic environment with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the coherence time",
    "is given by @xmath42 .",
    "hence , a single run of the quantum micromechanical interferometer has to be performed in a timescale of the order of a second or less . combined with the slow quantum dynamics of large masses , as we discuss below , this poses a challenge .",
    "we remark that pressures as low as @xmath43 can be achieved in cryogenic environments .",
    "this was shown , for example , in the experiments with antiproton lifetimes by gabrielse _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath44 is an upper - bound for the time scale @xmath16 used to define the gqr , especially regarding interpretation ( i ) .",
    "decoherence due to scattering , absorption , and emission of black - body radiation is described by pld in the lw limit , since the wavelength of thermal photons is typically much larger than the superposition size .",
    "the localization parameter is given by @xmath45 , where  @xcite ^s_bb c r^6 ^9 ^2 is the contribution due to scattering and [ eq : lbbe ] ^e(a)_bb c r^3 ^6 are the contributions due to emission ( e ) and absorption ( a ) of thermal photons .",
    "the last two contributions are the same when the internal bulk temperature @xmath46 of the sphere is the same as the environmental @xmath36 .",
    "these localization parameters depend on the dielectric permittivity @xmath47 of the sphere at the thermal frequency @xmath48 . for a sphere of @xmath39 and density @xmath49",
    ", one can show that & & 10 ^ -15 ^9 ^ 2 + & & 10 ^ -7 ^6 hence , in order to minimize the effect of decoherence due to black - body radiation , such that gravitationally - induced decoeherence would dominate , the quantum micromechanical interferometer should be implemented in a cryogenic environment .",
    "any experiment will suffer from unavoidable vibrational noise .",
    "let us consider vibrations along the @xmath26-axis described by the fluctuating variable @xmath50 , which has length units and fulfills @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the vibrational noise is characterized by the power spectral density s_xx ( ) = e^ , which has units of @xmath53 . for a given external potential @xmath54 that depends on the @xmath26-coordinate of the center - of - mass of the sphere",
    ", the vibrational noise leads to a time - dependent stochastic force given by @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can then be written as @xmath56 . for a harmonic potential of the form @xmath57 with the stochastic force due to vibrations given by @xmath58",
    ", one can show  @xcite that by averaging the stochastic force , one obtains a master equation for the dynamics .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath59 , this master equation is of the pld form in the lw limit with a localization parameter given by _",
    "v = s_xx(_p ) .",
    "note that the decoherence due to vibrations scales quadratically with the mass of the sphere and quartically with the trapping frequency since stochastic force is proportional to @xmath60 for a harmonic potential . as expected , the stochastic force is zero when the particle is not in an external potential . in order to falsify gravitationally - induced decoherence in the presence of an external harmonic potential",
    ", the decoherence induced by such fluctuations has to satisfy @xmath61 , which becomes increasingly challenging with the size of the sphere .",
    "in particular , for a sphere of @xmath39 one requires @xmath62 ^ 2 \\times 10^{-15}~\\text{m}/\\sqrt{\\text{hz}}$ ] .",
    "thus , in order to suppress the effects of vibration - induced decoherence , the implementation of the quantum micromechanical interferometer necessitates a minimal use of external potentials in addition to substantial vibration isolation .",
    "in any quantum micromechanical interferometer scheme there are two important dynamical processes that require some time : the generation of a large enough coherence length , to be defined below , and the generation of an interference pattern with sufficient visibility , namely that the separation between the interference fringes is larger than the resolution with which the position can be measured .    in order to define the coherence length ,",
    "let us first recall some properties of an important class of states ",
    "gaussian states  that can be used to describe the quantum state of the sphere along the @xmath26-axis . a quantum state @xmath27 with @xmath63 = \\tr [ \\pop \\hat \\rho ] = 0 $ ] is called gaussian if it is completely determined by the following three real parameters @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath65 $ ] , and @xmath66/2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "indeed , the density matrix of a gaussian state in the position basis is given by [ gausstate ] = e^ -a_1 x^2 - a_1^ * x^2 - a_2 x x , where    v_x a_1 & - , + v_x a_2 & .",
    "here we have used that the purity @xmath67 $ ] of a gaussian state is given by @xmath68^{-1/2}$ ] . note that the heisenberg uncertainty relation for a gaussian state reads as @xmath69 .",
    "the coherence length @xmath70 for a gaussian state is defined as @xmath71/\\sqrt{2 \\pi v_x}$ ] , and is given by the compact expression .",
    "the coherence length scales with the position variance as @xmath72 , as expected , with a scaling factor given by the purity of the state . for a gaussian state with a coherence length @xmath70 incident on a double slit of separation @xmath73",
    ", one will observe a coherent superposition resulting in interference fringes for @xmath74 and an incoherent mixture for @xmath75 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that during free expansion of the wavefunction without decoherence , or in other words , under unitary evolution with @xmath76 , the coherence length grows at a speed given by _",
    "( t ) = . starting out in the ground state of a harmonic potential with frequency @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then @xmath80 .",
    "note that the larger the mass the slower the coherence length grows .",
    "for a sphere of @xmath39 and mass density @xmath81 initially in a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath82 , the speed at which the coherence length grows is @xmath83 .",
    "since we would like to have @xmath70 of the order of @xmath2 , this speed in free expansion poses a challenge for propagation times of the order of a second , as required to prevent decoherence due to scattering of air molecules .",
    "even more challenging is the time required to generate sufficiently separated fringes .",
    "it is known in matter - wave interferometery that after the gaussian state passes through a double slit of separation @xmath84 , one obtains a coherent superposition which after free expansion downstream generates , in the absence of decoherence , an interference pattern with a fringe spacing x_f =",
    ". the fringe separation speed is thus given by @xmath85 .",
    "for a sphere of @xmath39 , mass density @xmath49 , and assuming a double slit of separation @xmath86 , the speed is given by @xmath87 which is very small .",
    "for example , assuming a position measurement resolution of @xmath88 , one would require @xmath89 to obtain resolvable fringes .",
    "this definitely poses a very important challenge .",
    "the final challenge is to prepare a quantum superposition of the center - of - mass position of the sphere , which should ideally be done without any decoherence .",
    "this is a non - gaussian operation that transforms a gaussian state with a positive wigner function into a non - gaussian state with a negative wigner function .",
    "the preparation of non - gaussian states has been a major goal and a rather formidable challenge in quantum nanomechanics  @xcite .",
    "a double slit in a young s experiment is a beautiful example of how this can be done .",
    "however , in a double slit one is typically forced to prepare spatial superpositions which are larger than the size of the object , namely @xmath90 . for large masses",
    "this condition might be too demanding as it could compromise the conditions required to meet the challenges discussed before .",
    "for instance the larger the superposition the longer it takes for fringes to be generated for the final measurement .",
    "hence it might be advantageous to prepare superpositions with an extent not necessarily larger than the diameter of the sphere . implementing a double slit with a slit separation smaller than the size of the sphere is a seemingly naive challenge , but an important one to meet when taking into account the constraints posed by the slow quantum dynamics and the unavoidable sources of decoherence .",
    "in this section we propose and analyze a quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol for a massive object .",
    "the protocol will be designed in a manner such that two of the challenges discussed in , namely that of slow quantum dynamics and of the double slit , are addressed .",
    "a detailed implementation of the protocol for the specific case of a superconducting sphere is proposed and analysed in .",
    "this implementation is designed to overcome the unavoidable decoherence challenge .",
    "thus in this section we keep the discussion general without reference to any particular implementation .",
    "the quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol is divided into 7 steps ( see  ) ;    1 .   *",
    "cooling*. cooling the center - of - mass motion in a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath91 for a duration @xmath92 to a final phonon occupation number @xmath93 .",
    "* boost*. evolution of the center - of - mass motion in an inverted harmonic potential of frequency @xmath94 for a time @xmath95 which exponentially boosts the sphere s kinetic energy .",
    "3 .   * free*. free evolution for a time @xmath96 to delocalize the center - of - mass over large distances .",
    "4 .   * split*. a squared position measurement for a time @xmath97 to prepare a quantum superposition state . 5 .",
    "* rotation*. a short evolution for a duration @xmath98 in a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath99 to give opposite momentum to the two wave packets in the superposition .",
    "6 .   * inflation*. evolution in an inverted quadratic potential of frequency @xmath100 for a duration @xmath101 to exponentially generate the interference fringes",
    "* measure*. a squared position measurement of time @xmath102 to unveil the interference pattern .",
    "the total time of the protocol after cooling is thus given by @xmath103 .",
    "the position of the center - of - mass of the sphere is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the position of the center of along the direction in which the quantum superposition is prepared .",
    "the other degrees of freedom are assumed to be in a thermal classical state with a temperature as low as possible .",
    "steps 1 to 3 of the protocol are used to create a large and coherent matter - wave of the center of mass of the sphere along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "these are the steps used to generate an observable difference between the state of the sphere when one includes the existence of gravitationally - induced decoherence and when one does not .",
    "in particular , the coherence length @xmath70 after step 3 , takes a smaller value @xmath106 when gravitationally - induced decoherence is taken into account . in order to falsify gravitationally - induced decoherence we aim at operating the micromechanical interferometer in a regime where @xmath107 , for a given slit separation @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that the double slit prepares a coherent superposition in the absence of gravitationally - induced decoherence , and an incoherent mixture otherwise .",
    "steps 4 to 7 consist of performing the double slit operation and unveiling the interference fringes for the case in which the coherent superposition has been prepared .",
    "these steps have to be done unitarily such that if one prepares a coherent superposition the visibility of the interference fringes is not washed out .",
    "thus , we emphasize that steps 1 to 3 are used to create the difference between the state with and without the existence of gravitationally induced decoherence , and steps 4 to 7 are used to demonstrate this difference .    in the following",
    "we show how the position probability distribution along the @xmath26-axis after step 7 , namely @xmath108 , can be analytically calculated taking into account pld in the lw limit and all the parameters describing the protocol .",
    "we divide the discussion into the separate steps of the protocol .      in this step , which takes place from @xmath109 to @xmath110 , the center - of - mass motion of the microsphere along the @xmath26-axis",
    "is cooled using a linear quantum nanomechanical coupling to a cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "the particle is confined in a harmonic trap of frequency @xmath111 , such that its zero - point motion length is given by @xmath112 .",
    "the total hamiltonian describing the coupling of the particle to a driven cavity mode of frequency @xmath113 and creation ( annihilation ) mode operators @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) is given by    [ coolham ] = & -  + _ 1 + g_l(+ ) + & - e_1 ( - ) .",
    "the above hamiltonian is given in a rotating frame with the drive frequency @xmath116 . here",
    "@xmath117 with @xmath118=1 $ ] , @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the strength of the coherent drive that couples to the cavity mode , and @xmath121 is the linear quantum nanomechanical coupling .",
    "we linearize the system by making the change of variables @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and choosing @xmath124 and @xmath125 such that assuming that @xmath126 and neglecting the decoherence in the center - of - mass motion , one can eliminate the cavity mode degree of freedom @xmath115 and write an effective master equation for the reduced density matrix of the sphere .",
    "this master equation leads to the following rate equation for the phonon number of the sphere center - of - mass degree of freedom : with the additional assumption that the bath attached to the cavity mode is at zero temperature . in this case the damping and driving terms of the above rate equation are given by with the shifted detuning @xmath127 .",
    "if at @xmath110 the initial number of phonons is @xmath128 , the number of phonons at a later time @xmath92 is given by |n = + e^-(a_--a_+ ) t_1 .",
    "an additional heating source in the center - of - mass motion at a rate @xmath129 can be easily included by replacing @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "note that when the coupling to the cavity mode is turned on for the cooling process , the equilibrium position of the sphere along @xmath26 shifts to the mean field value @xmath132 .",
    "one can expect that as the coupling is turned off slowly the cooled state of the particle will be adiabatically shifted to @xmath133 .    at @xmath110 the center - of - mass motion along the @xmath26-axis",
    "is thus prepared in a gaussian state given by [ eq : solstep1 ]    v_x(t=0 ) & = _ 1 ^ 2 ( 2 |n + 1 ) , + v_p(t=0 ) & = ( 2 |n + 1 ) , + c(t=0 ) & = 0 .",
    "+    this state has a purity @xmath134 and an initial coherence length given by @xmath135 .",
    "owing to the large mass , the coherence length at this step will be typically much smaller than the size of a single atom .",
    "our goal is to expand it to a value of the order of the radius of the sphere , that is , by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this is what we do in the next two steps of the protocol .",
    "as discussed in  , in free space the coherence length of the state grows with a speed given by @xmath136 . in order to increase this speed , in step 2 ( boost ) the center - of - mass evolves in an inverted harmonic potential of frequency @xmath137 , given by the hamiltonian @xmath138 , from @xmath110 to @xmath139 such that @xmath140 is boosted by a factor of @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "assuming pld in the lw limit , with a localization parameter @xmath142 , the dynamics preserves the gaussian character of the state at @xmath110 since the hamiltonian is quadratic and the jump operators in the master equation are linear in @xmath105 and @xmath143 .",

    "thus , for typical non - superconducting metals , we find that decoherence due to magnetic field fluctuations near the surface is much larger than gravitationally - induced decoherence .",
    "therefore , to be able to observe gravitationally - induced decoherence , one needs to place the microsphere near a superconducting surface .",
    "that is , one should use a superconducting atom chip  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic skatepark implementation of the quantum micromechanical interferometer protocol discussed above is ambitious and therefore experimentally challenging , specially when operating in the regime presented in the case study of .",
    "as discussed in the introduction of the article , we suggest to address this goal from a top - down approach , namely to gradually increase the delocalization distance of a superconducting microsphere brought to the quantum regime .",
    "to do so , one could perform a set of progressively challenging experiments that could be themselves relevant in the the field of quantum nano- and micromechanics  @xcite . a possible experimental roadmap could be to show :    * magnetic levitation of a superconducting microsphere in vacuum . * magnetomechanical coupling between a superconducting object and a quantum circuit .",
    "the superconducting object does not need to be levitating , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "* ground state cooling of a magnetically levitated superconducting sphere using a quantum magnetomechanical coupling by combining the two previous points . *",
    "the preparation of non - trivial quantum states of the center of mass of a magnetically levitated superconducting microsphere using a quantum magnetomechanical coupling to a quantum circuit .",
    "these states still have a small delocalization distance comparable to the zero point motion . * quantum coherent expansion of the center - of - mass motion by making the trap shallower after ground state cooling . * exponential speed - up of the coherent expansion by inverting the quadratic potential after ground state cooling . * the implementation of ground state cooling and coherent expansion as proposed in step 1 , 2 , and 3 of the skatepark . *",
    "perform a squared continuous - time quantum measurement using the coupling to a quantum circuit to prepare a double slit . *",
    "the implementation of the quantum micromechanical interferometer with the 7 steps with small slit separations .",
    "one can then gradually increase the slit separation distance .",
    "note that this roadmap would also allow to carefuly characterize the standard sources of decoherence arising from scattering of air molecules , vibrations , and magnetic field fluctuations , as well as other sources of decoherence that may have been overlooked .",
    "in this section we consider a particular set of experimental parameters and analytically calculate the interference pattern that would be obtained in the proposed quantum micromechanical interferometer .",
    "this is done considering standard sources of decoherence and with ( red curve in ) or without ( grey curve in ) gravitationally - induced decoherence . with the parameters explicitly listed in the appendix , one obtains the interference pattern plot in , indicating that the faint parameter - free gravitationally - induced decoherence could be unambiguously falsified .",
    "we emphasize that the set of parameters that we chose , see appendix , has not been fine - tuned .",
    "it is only a representative example and we anticipate that there would be other sets of parameters that would lead to the same conclusion , namely that gravitationally - induced decoherence could be falsified .",
    "of course , some of the important parameters have been chosen to ensure that the interferometer protocol is faithfully implemented . in the rest of this section",
    "we discuss and justify the same .",
    "we have considered a superconducting sphere in the meissner state with a radius of @xmath39 and a mass of @xmath352 , well inside the gravitational quantum regime , as shown in .",
    "the superposition size is determined by the slit separation @xmath353 and slit width @xmath354 .",
    "the total time of the quantum micromechanical interferometer after cooling ( which takes @xmath355 ) is @xmath356 .",
    "this time is distributed between the different steps as @xmath357 , @xmath358 , @xmath359 , @xmath360 , @xmath361 , and @xmath362 .",
    "the harmonic potentials in steps 2 , 5 , and 7 have a frequency of @xmath363 . note that the longest duration in the operation of the interferometer is in the free expansion of step 3 , where standard sources of decoherence are minimal .",
    "the coherence length after step 3 is given by @xmath364 without gravitationally - induced decoherence , and @xmath365 including it .",
    "hence note that the condition @xmath195 is fulfilled .",
    "the latter is the key condition in order to falsify gravitationally - induced decoherence , as shown in .",
    "steps 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 are intended to build the interference pattern , in case of a coherent superposition , and thus have to be performed as fast as possible in order to prevent decoherence from washing - out the interference pattern . with the parameters used ,",
    "the blurring distance is given by @xmath366 with the presence of gravitationally - induced decoherence and @xmath367 with only standard sources of decoherence .",
    "note that the difference is minimal and the blurring is small enough to not wash - out the interference fringes generated when gravitationally - induced decoherence is absent , since the fringe separation takes the value @xmath368 for the chosen parameters .",
    "a larger mass of the sphere has not been considered mainly because of two reasons : ( i ) the magnetic field gradients are limited by the fact that the field at the surface of the sphere has to be smaller than the first critical field of the superconducting material .",
    "the larger the mass , the smaller the field gradients and thus the smaller the trap frequency in step 1 , which then prevents one from achieving the resolved - sideband regime and thus preparing a sufficiently pure initial state .",
    "namely , we require the initial thermal mean phonon number occupation to be smaller than 1 , and @xmath369 for our parameter choice .",
    "( ii ) the larger the mass , the more vibration isolation is required to ensure that gravitationally - induced decoherence is the main source of decoherence .",
    "we have already considered a very good isolation vibration with values of @xmath370 at frequencies below @xmath371 , as required in steps 3 , 4 , and 7 , and @xmath372 at frequencies of @xmath363 , as required in steps 2,5 and 6 . in a cryogenic environment",
    "these values are challenging , and comparable to vibration isolation in present - day gravitational wave detectors .",
    "nevertheless , we remark that in future cryogenic gravitational wave detectors , schemes for achieving vibration isolation at the incredible numbers of @xmath373 at low frequencies are being developed , see for instance the kagra project  @xcite .",
    "vibrations are the main source of decoherence in our model provided that the decoherence from magnetic field fluctuations can be ignored .",
    "the latter is the case if the surface is superconducting , for example , if one uses a superconducting atom chip  @xcite .",
    "note that the sphere is skating at a distance from the surface of the order of @xmath374 .",
    "the distance slightly varies in each step of the protocol , something that we have not optimized since the smooth transitions between steps have not been included in our calculations .",
    "should the decoherence from the surface be a hindering factor , one could also consider implementing the interferometer protocol in free fall  @xcite with external magnetic potentials speeding - up the dynamics , as in step 2 and 6 of the protocol .    as mentioned before",
    ", we refer to the appendix for the complete list of experimental parameters used to analytically calculate , as an example , the interference pattern shown in .",
    "we have proposed and analyzed a quantum micromechanical interferometer scheme for preparing and probing quantum superpositions of a sphere in the micrometer scale with a mass @xmath375 .",
    "the quantum superposition state is prepared by using a young s double slit with slit separation comparable to the radius of the sphere . in particular , we have proposed an all - magnetic on - chip scheme where a superconducting microsphere skates in a magnetic landscape generated by persistent currents .",
    "the chip also houses some squids that are used to cool , implement a double slit , and measure final interference fringes . as the sphere skates through such a magnetic skatepark an all - magnetic young s double slit experiment",
    "is implemented passively , namely without the need to switch on and off magnetic potentials and to actively control the quantum circuits . using a feasible set of experimental parameters as a case study",
    ", we have shown that one can enter into the gravitational quantum regime where the faint parameter free gravitationally - induced collapse model , proposed by disi and penrose  @xcite , could be unambiguously falsified .",
    "while we have focused on this paradigmatic parameter - free collapse model as a figure of merit , we remark that our proposal would falsify the continuous - spontaneous - localization collapse model  @xcite with a collapse frequency phenomenological parameter as small as @xmath376 , several orders of magnitude below the original value proposed by ghirardi , rimini , and weber in the 80 s  @xcite . in our analysis , especially regarding the experimental feasibility , we have modelled the experiment with some necessary degree of simplification .",
    "for example , we have not considered the many potential sources of noise and decoherence that could be encountered in a real experimental implementation .",
    "instead , we have analyzed the aspects that we consider unavoidable in any experimental implementation and that would pose more than a technological challenge . while the experimental implementation of our proposal is ambitious and therefore challenging , we have nevertheless argued that it could be addressed by a set of progressively challenging experiments that would be themeselves relevant in the field of quantum nano- and micromechanics .",
    "we believe that in general , experiments aiming to explore the quantum superposition principle of very massive objects would benefit from the conditions that we have analysed and determined to be crucial for this proposal : ( i ) a cryogenic environment that minimizes decoherence due to black - body radiation and due to scattering of air molecules because of the ultra - high vacuum present in such environments .",
    "we note , for example , that pressures less than @xmath377 mbar have been achieved in cryogenic environments @xcite , ( ii ) the possibility to use static fields ( ideally using persistent currents ) to generate inverted potentials that speed - up the otherwise very slow quantum dynamics , ( iii ) a very good vibration isolation to avoid decoherence when using external potentials , ( iv ) superconducting surfaces in case of near - surface proposals since low frequency electromagnetic field fluctuations are absent , and ( v ) the use of quantum circuits to cool , to engineer non - linearities , and to measure the position of the massive object .",
    "we remark that one of the main ingredients to perform quantum interference of such massive objects in less than a second is the use of inverted potentials that speed - up the quantum dynamics .",
    "this idea could also be implemented in a free fall experiment that would require a cryogenic high - vacuum tower of few meters  @xcite , employing the same protocol as described here . in our protocol",
    "we propose to perform the young s double slit by performing a quantum measurement of the squared position . alternatively",
    ", one could also consider preparing the quantum superposition using a non - gaussian ( more than quadratic dependence in position ) magnetic potential .",
    "also , one could consider a magnetic grating formed , for instance , using the field created by an array of pinned superconducting vortices or nanomagnets .",
    "if the magnetic lattice has field maxima larger than the critical field of the sphere , superconductivity is prevented for spheres passing through these areas .",
    "such a magnetic grating could be used for near - field matter - wave interferometry , as an all - magnetic version of the all - optical talbot - lau matter - wave interferometers currently being implemented  @xcite . in this all - magnetic scenario",
    ", one could again use static fields to speed - up the dynamics without creating decoherence and thus increase the mass of the particle used in near - field matter - wave interferometers without requiring a space environment  @xcite .",
    "our proposal could also be extended to exploit the other interpretations of the gravitational quantum regime .",
    "in particular , one could consider two cold superconducting spheres moving along parallel magnetic waveguides and measure the mutual gravitational interaction which can then be used to determine @xmath6 .",
    "that is a levitation version of a recently proposed experiment for measuring @xmath6 with milligram masses  @xcite .",
    "one could also consider entangling the levitated spheres using the gravitational interaction .",
    "we hope that the proposal presented in this manuscript , namely an earth - based on - chip all - magnetic quantum micromechanical interferometer exploring quantum mechanics in a hitherto unexplored parameter regime , will trigger further table - top experimental and theoretical research on the interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity .",

    "<S> we propose and analyze an all - magnetic scheme to perform a young s double slit experiment with a micron - sized superconducting sphere of mass @xmath0 amu . </S>",
    "<S> we show that its center of mass could be prepared in a spatial quantum superposition state with an extent of the order of half a micrometer . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is based on magnetically levitating the sphere above a superconducting chip and letting it skate through a static magnetic potential landscape where it interacts for short intervals with quantum circuits . in this way a protocol for fast quantum interferometry using quantum magnetomechanics is passively implemented . </S>",
    "<S> such a table - top earth - based quantum experiment would operate in a parameter regime where gravitational energy scales become relevant . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the faint parameter - free gravitationally - induced decoherence collapse model , proposed by disi and penrose , could be unambiguously falsified . </S>",
    "<S> the ambitious goal of the proposal could be experimentally addressed by implementing a set of intermediate , progressively challenging , experiments that might be themselves relevant in the field of quantum miromechanics . </S>"
