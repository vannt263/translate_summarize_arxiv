    "a new family of noncommutative ( nc ) field theories @xcite , @xcite came under increasing scrutiny after 1998 when it was realized @xcite , @xcite that string theory seems to have some effective regimes described by noncommutative field theories ( ncft ) defined on a simple nc version of flat four dimensional space .",
    "this latter is the moyal space which has constant commutators between space coordinates . for a mathematical description see e.g @xcite , @xcite ; for a detailed study on the relationship between the moyal algebra and non unital extention(s ) of the connes spectral triple , see @xcite . for reviews on noncommutative geometry ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , it was noticed @xcite that the simplest nc @xmath3 model , ( @xmath4 real - valued ) on the 4-dimensional moyal space is not renormalizable due to the occurence of a phenomenon called ultraviolet / infrared ( uv / ir ) mixing @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon stems basically from the existence of nonplanar diagrams that are uv finite but nevertheless develop ir singularities which when inserted into higher order diagrams are not of the renormalizable type @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a first solution to this problem , hereafter called the `` harmonic solution '' , was proposed in 2004 @xcite .",
    "it amounts to supplement the initial action with a simple harmonic oscillator term leading to a fully renormalisable ncft . for recent reviews , see e.g @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this result seems to be related to the covariance of the model under the so called langmann - szabo duality @xcite .",
    "other renormalisable noncommutative matter field theories have then been identified @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and detailled studies of the properties of the corresponding renormalisation group flows have been carried out @xcite , @xcite , exhibiting in particular the vanishing of the @xmath5-function to all orders for the @xmath6 model @xcite .",
    "but , so far , the construction of a fully renormalisable gauge theory on 4-@xmath7 moyal spaces remains a challenging problem .",
    "the simplest nc analog of the yang - mills action given by @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 ( in the notations used in e.g @xcite ) , suffers from uv / ir mixing .",
    "this basically stems from the occurence of an ir singularity in the polarisation tensor @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is some external momentum ) . from a standard one - loop calculation",
    ", we easily infer that @xmath13 where @xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 and @xmath17 denotes the euler function .",
    "this singularity , albeit obviously transverse in the sense of the slavnov - taylor - ward identities , does not correspond to some gauge invariant term .",
    "this implies that the recent alternative solution to the uv / ir mixing proposed for the nc @xmath3 model in @xcite , which roughly amounts to balance the ir singularity throught a counterterm having a similar form , can not be extended straighforwardly ( if possible at all ) to the case of gauge theories .",
    "recently , the extension of the harmonic solution to the case of gauge theories has been achieved in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these works have singled out , as potential candidate for renormalisable gauge theory on 4-@xmath7 moyal space , the following generic action @xmath18 in which the 2nd and 3rd terms may be viewed as \" gauge counterparts  of the harmonic term introduced in @xcite . here , @xmath19 is the covariant coordinates , a natural gauge covariant tensorial form stemming from the existence of a canonical gauge invariant connection in the present nc framework .",
    "this action has interesting properties @xcite , @xcite deserving further studies .",
    "for instance , gauge invariant mass terms for the gauge fields are allowed even in the absence of higgs mechanism .",
    "besides , the covariant coordinates appears to bear some similarity with higgs fields .",
    "it turns out that the action has a non - trivial vacuum , whose explicit expression has been derived very recently in @xcite , which complicates the study of its actual renormalisability .",
    "notice that non trivial vacuum configurations also occur within nc scalar models with harmonic term as shown in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that most of the salient ( classical ) properties of nc gauge theories on the moyal space have a natural interpretation within the framework of differential calculus based on derivations .",
    "the link between the simplest nc analog of yang - mills theory and some version of the spectral triple has been studied closely in @xcite .",
    "note that we will not examine here the viewpoint of spectral triples .",
    "moreover , the moyal algebra we will consider is not the one used in the construction of these spectral triples .",
    "the differential calculus based on the derivations has been settled down in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for an exhaustive review ,",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this framework underlies the first prototypes of nc matrix - valued field theories @xcite , @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite . here",
    ", we consider in particular a natural modification of the minimal differential calculus generated by the `` spatial derivations '' , the one that implicitely underlies most of the works that appeared in the physics litterature .",
    "we show that this new differential calculus , generated by the maximal subalgebra of the derivation algebra of @xmath0 whose elements are related to ( infinitesimal ) symplectomorphisms , permits one to construct nc gauge theories that can be interpreted as yang - mills - higgs models on @xmath0 , the covariant coordinates of the physics litterature being interpreted as higgs fields , thanks to the existence of a gauge invariant canonical connection .",
    "we consider models invariant under @xmath20 or @xmath21 gauge transformations .",
    "we also compare in detail the present situation to the other nc geometries stemming from the finite dimensional matrix algebra @xmath1 and for the algebra of matrix valued functions @xmath2 .",
    "note that a similar modification of the minimal differential calculus on @xmath0 has been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , this work did not consider the construction of gauge theories on @xmath0 but was only focused on the construction of subalgebras of the @xmath22 moyal algebra from a set of constraints forming a subalgebra of the @xmath23 algebra and the obtention of the algebra of smooth functions of @xmath24 from a commutative limit .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in subsection",
    "[ generalproperties ] , we collect the main properties of the differential calculus based on the derivations of an associative unital @xmath25-algebra used in the sequel and introduce a definition of a nc connection on a module over the algebra , as a natural generalisation of ordinary connections .",
    "the specific properties and simplifications occuring when the module is equal to the algebra , which is the case relevant for ( most of ) the ncft on moyal spaces studied so far , are detailled in subsection  [ casem = a ] .",
    "this provides the suitable framework to deal with models invariant under @xmath20 gauge transformations . in subsection",
    "[ casem = an ] , we give the generalisation to the @xmath21 case which is obtained when the module is equal to the product of @xmath26 copies of the algebra . in section  [ gaugemoyal ] ,",
    "we focus on the moyal algebra @xmath0 whose main properties are recalled in subsection  [ generalpropertiemoyal ] . in subsection",
    "[ diffcalculusmoyal ] , we consider the differential calculus based on the maximal subalgebra of the derivations of @xmath0 whose elements can be related to infinitesimal symplectomorphisms .",
    "then , a direct application of the results of subsection  [ casem = a ] ( resp .",
    "[ casem = an ] ) leads to a natural construction of yang - mills - higgs models defined on @xmath0 with @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) gauge invariance .",
    "this is presented in subsection  [ gaugaactionsmoyal ] where we also indicate some classical properties of the nc yang - mills - higgs actions obtained from the modified differential calculus .",
    "explicit one - loop computation of the vacuum polarisation tensor , given in the appendices , shows that these latter still exhibits an ir singularity of the type given in .",
    "we also perform a comparition between these models and other gauge invariant models . in section  [ discussion ] , we compare the mathematical features underlying the nc differential calculus of section  [ gaugemoyal ] to those for the nc geometry stemming from the finite dimensional matrix algebra @xmath1 as well as for the algebra of matrix valued functions @xmath2 .",
    "the main point is that , in some sense , the case considered in section  [ gaugemoyal ] interpolates between these two latter situations .",
    "the differential calculus based on the derivations of an associative algebra has been initially introduced and developped in @xcite to which we refer for more details .",
    "a related review can be found in @xcite .",
    "this differential calculus can be viewed as a nc generalisation of the koszul algebraic approach to differential geometry @xcite . for other nc differential calculi ,",
    "related in particular to spectral triples , see in e.g @xcite , @xcite .",
    "subsection  [ generalproperties ] summarizes the main properties of the derivation - based differential calculus taken from @xcite that will be needed thourough the paper .",
    "this will fix our notations and conventions .",
    "subsection  [ casem = a ] outlines the essential mathematical features underlying ( most of ) the studies on nc field theories defined on moyal spaces that are sometimes overlooked or even ignored by physicists .",
    "this merely corresponds to the case where the algebra plays the role of the module used to define connections .",
    "the salient role played by the canonical connection is emphasized .",
    "subsection  [ casem = an ] involves the generalisation to the case where the module is equal to the product of @xmath26 copies of the algebra which is the relevant for the construction of @xmath21-invariant gauge theories .",

    "past classical studies of the corresponding gauge theories , with an action constructed mainly from the square of the curvature , gave rise to the intepretation of the gauge potential as involving two parts , one being the `` ordinary '' gauge theories and the other one identifiable as higgs fields .",
    "indeed , one can show that the simple action @xmath424 @xmath425 constructed using the corresponding curvature @xmath426 exhibits non trivial vacuum states in the higgs part , from which a mass generation on the `` ordinary '' gauge fields is a consequence .",
    "this situation has been generalized @xcite to the case of the algebra of endomorphisms of a @xmath427-vector bundle in the sense that the situation of the trivial bundle correspond to the algebra of matrix - valued functions . because of the possible non trivial global topology of the bundle , the situation is more involved @xcite but reveals essentially that this physical interpretation of the components of the noncommutative gauge fields can be performed in the same way .",
    "this framework has been used to generalize and classify nc generalisations of invariant connections in @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills - higgs type action constructed from differential calculus based on the subalgebra @xmath258 in section  [ gaugemoyal ] shares common features with this last situation : each additional inner derivation supplementing the `` ordinary spatial derivations '' , which may be viewed as related to an `` extra noncommutative dimension '' , corresponds to an additional covariant coordinate that can be interpreted as a higgs field .",
    "covariant coordinates have thus a natural interpretation as higgs fields within the framework of the present derivation - based differential calculus",
    ". then , yang - mills - higgs models can be obtained from actions built from the square of the curvature - .    as a final remark ,",
    "let us stress that until now , higgs fields can be given a natural interpretation within nc geometry when it is possible to introduce covariant coordinates as in proposition  [ prop2.9 ] . in the particular examples explored so far",
    ", this occurs because it is possible to substract a  reference object \" to ( some part of ) the 1-form gauge connections , therefore canceling ( some part of ) the inhomogeneous term of gauge transformations . in the example considered in the present paper , this reference object is the @xmath23 part of the 1-form @xmath121 appearing in lemma  [ lemmainnerdifferential ] . in the case of the nc geometry based on the algebra of matrix valued functions , the 1-form @xmath398 in the matrix directions",
    "is used as the reference object . in both cases ,",
    "the substraction takes place in the corresponding spaces of nc 1-forms . in the context of the standard model introduced using spectral triples (",
    "see e.g @xcite ) , higgs fields are introduced as covariant coordinates in the direction of the finite nc geometry , where the dirac operator @xmath428 in that direction plays the role of the reference object . in this latter case",
    ", the substraction takes place in the space of bounded operators of the relevant hilbert space because @xmath428 is simply constructed as a finite dimensional matrix and the connection 1-form is represented as bounded operators on the hilbert space , through @xmath429 $ ] where @xmath430 is the differential for the universal differential calculus and @xmath7 is the ( total ) dirac operator splitted into the spatial dirac operator and @xmath428 .",
    "we point out that the cancelation of some part of the inhomogeneous term of gauge transformations in all the above mentioned cases can be realized thanks to the existence of a relation between the differential in degree @xmath431 and the commutator with this reference object : in theses 3 cases , one has respectively @xmath432 $ ] , @xmath433 $ ] ( for the matrix algebra ) and @xmath429 $ ]",
