    "spherically symmetric models are often the simplest realistic models conceivable for astrophysical systems , and have been applied successfully to describe not only hydrostatic objects such as stars , but also hydrodynamic processes , for instance stellar winds ( parker 1958 ) . in many cases",
    "it is desirable to extend a spherically symmetric hydrodynamic problem to the analogous magnetohydrodynamic problem . in a global sense",
    "such a magnetohydrodynamic analogue can not exist , as that would require the existence of magnetic monopoles . locally , however , the magnetic field is divergence - free , and presents a natural approximation of a region with a diverging magnetic field . in hydrodynamics",
    "there are only acoustic waves ( for spherical sound waves see e.g. landau & lifshitz 1987 ) , but the magnetic field introduces alfvn waves .",
    "these transverse magnetic field oscillations can not be extended to cover an entire spherical surface without introducing discontinuities , but once again it will not present any difficulties locally .    in a previous paper ( boynton & torkelsson 1996 , hereafter paper 1 ) we have shown that nonlinear alfvn waves in a planar geometry can steepen and form current sheets , and thereby be damped by joule dissipation or by doing mechanical work on the background medium .",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism is limited by the alfvn wave becoming less nonlinear as it propagates upwards through a stratified medium .",
    "a spherical alfvn wave on the other hand may become less nonlinear for some time , but eventually has to grow nonlinear again because of the divergence of the background magnetic field .",
    "furthermore the gas pressure decreases faster than the magnetic pressure with height independently of whether the symmetry is plane - parallel or spherical , so that the alfvn wave becomes more dynamically important .",
    "models of alfvn wave - driven outflows have been constructed by hartmann & macgregor ( 1980 , 1982 ) to explain the winds from late - type giants , although a more popular model is that the outflows are driven by radiation pressure working on dust in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "it has been pointed out that the alfvn waves must damp within a few stellar radii to avoid accelerating the wind to too high velocities .",
    "there is no generally accepted model for this damping and holzer , fl  & leer ( 1983 ) have pointed out that the stellar wind depends sensitively on the damping mechanism .",
    "a spherically symmetric model may also apply to the coronal holes observed on the sun ( bohlin 1976 , zirker 1977 ) .",
    "the magnetic field in a coronal hole is open , which allows the plasma to expand outwards and form the so - called fast solar wind .",
    "this component of the solar wind is too fast to be described by the classical parker ( 1958 ) model , and it is possible that the extra acceleration is provided by alfvn waves .",
    "alfvn waves have been observed further out in the solar wind ( belcher & davis 1971 , balogh et al .",
    "1995 ) , but it is not known how these waves relate to the ones that are supposedly present in the corona .",
    "section 2 describes the initial hydrostatic model and summarizes the properties of linear waves propagating through it .",

    "3 . section 4 discusses the physical interpretation and the astrophysical consequences of our results , in particular , with respect to solar and stellar winds , and our conclusions are summarized in sect .",

    "it was suggested in paper 1 that the damping of the alfvn waves takes place in current sheets .",
    "these current sheets appear at the nodes of the alfvn wave , because the nodes represent minima of magnetic pressure , and thus oppositely directed magnetic field lines are pushed together at the nodes .",

    "we have seen in some of our simulations that nonlinear alfvn waves can in some circumstances propagate faster than the local alfvn speed ( fig .",
    "[ super_alfven]a - c ) .",
    "the reason that the wave in model 2c can propagate at a higher speed than those in models 2a and b is that the wave itself is accelerating an outflow with a maximum velocity of @xmath160 ms@xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ super_alfven]d ) .",
    "thus the alfvn wave gains the velocity of the medium it is propagating in .",
    "this effect was not found in paper 1 , as in the plane - parallel models the alfvn velocity is increasing upwards to eventually become supersonic .",
    "consequently the alfvn wave front manages to stay in front of the main outflow ( cf .",

    "[ precursor_3 ] that the alfvn wave is modulated on a frequency lower than the driving frequency . to test this",
    "we calculate power spectra of models 1b and 2b ( fig .",
    "[ power ] ) .",
    "in addition to the main peak at 0.0032 hz we see side peaks at 0.0030 and 0.0006 hz .",
    "to explain these extra peaks we note that a wave reflected back down by an inhomogeneity propagating upwards is doppler - shifted to a lower frequency @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the original frequency of the wave .",
    "to explain the side peak in model 1b we require an outflow velocity @xmath163 , which agrees well with the velocities generated in the model ( fig .",
    "[ power]b ) .",
    "the peak at 0.0006 hz of model 2b on the other hand requires @xmath164 , which is significantly higher than what is available ( fig .",
    "[ power]d ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation in this case is that the frequency 0.0006 hz represents the beat frequency between the original and reflected alfvn waves , thus giving the frequency of the reflected alfvn wave as 0.0026 hz , corresponding to @xmath165 .",
    "this agrees well with the velocity before the jump in @xmath38 at 11 @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ power]d ) , but the peak in the power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ power]c ) is at 0.002 hz , which may be a consequence of the inhomogeneity of the medium .",

    "1982 , macgregor & charbonneau 1994 ) .",
    "the main reason is that the alfvn waves may be able to drive the wind in circumstances where more well - understood mechanisms can be shown to be insufficient .",
    "this is for instance the case for the fast solar wind moving at velocities of 800 kms@xmath15 , which is too fast for the classical thermally driven wind model by parker ( 1958 ) , and the winds of late - type giants , where the temperatures are too low to drive a wind .",
    "a severe weakness of the models of the winds of late - type stars is that the alfvn waves must be damped within a few stellar radii in order to avoid over - accelerating the wind .",
    "usually this has been done by ascribing an arbitrary damping length to the alfvn waves , but the resulting models are sensitive to the choice of the damping length ( holzer et al . 1983 ) .",
    "in our simulations the waves are damped without the action of any dissipative mechanism while they are doing work on the background medium .",
    "our mechanism does not require the wavelength to become comparable to the length scale of the alfvn velocity variations in contrast to some previous attempts that have appealed to non - wkb waves being reflected .",
    "although we have not surveyed the parameter space it appears likely that the parameters of our model can be modified to provide a sufficiently effective damping to fulfill the constraints put on those wind models .",
    "an obvious improvement on our current simulations is to start from an initial state which describes an outflowing wind .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic waves may have been observed in the inner parts of the solar wind .",
    "ofman & davila ( 1997b ) have calculated that magnetohydrodynamic waves in the solar wind may give a line broadening of @xmath166 kms@xmath15 , which is comparable to the line widths observed by _",
    "( e.g. kohl et al .",
    "in particular ofman & davila ( 1997a ) suggests that what they call _ solitary _ waves are essential for the acceleration of the solar wind .",
    "the solitary waves are propagating @xmath33-@xmath38-perturbations generated by alfvn waves , and thus are akin to the density oscillations we have found in for instance fig .",
    "[ precursor_2 ] .",
    "the authors call them solitary waves as they believe them to be related to the solitary wave solutions found in slabs and thin flux tubes by roberts ( 1981 ) and roberts & mangeney ( 1982 ) .",
    "this is an interpretation that we find questionable for the following reason .",
    "it is certainly true that the two - dimensional axisymmetric model used by ofman & davila bears some resemblance to a flux tube with a lower density in the interior , but our one - dimensional simulations lack all features characteristic of a flux tube , and still we find the same kind of density oscillations propagating faster than the sound speed .",
    "we thus conclude that the oscillations can not be related to the existence of solitons in flux tubes . regarding the question of whether the solar wind is driven by alfvn waves or _ solitary _ waves that is very much a matter of semantics as",
    "the _ solitary _ waves must be driven by the alfvn waves .",
    "it is interesting to compare the simulations in terms of efficiency of deriving energy from the alfvn waves .",
    "the background models are roughly similar apart from that ofman & davila assume a radial magnetic field which is 70% stronger than the one we use in models 3 .",
    "they drive the alfvn wave at an amplitude inbetween our models 3a and b , and assume a period which is almost an order of magnitude longer than ours .",
    "consequently they find larger radial velocities than we do , but unfortunately they do not give any numbers for the fraction of the poynting flux that has been converted to mechanical energy .",
    "they do however state that @xmath167 of the poynting flux has been lost due to ohmic dissipation .",
    "this appears to be a rather inefficient conversion process , but one must keep in mind that their grid extends only to 4 @xmath0 , and we typically find that most of the damping takes place at larger distances .",
    "naturally there are alternative models for driving the fast solar wind .",
    "feldman et al . (",
    "1996 ) have suggested that the outflows are driven by the same kind of reconnection events that produce the x - ray jets ( yokoyama & shibata 1995 ) . in this model",
    "the emerging magnetic field of a bipolar region collides with the magnetic field of the chromospheric network .",
    "this field is concentrated in narrow flux tubes in the photosphere , but due to the stratification the flux tube increases in radius upwards . at the collision",
    "point the magnetic fields reconnect and two jets moving at close to the alfvn velocity appear .",
    "only a part of the momentum of the jet is directed upwards , but the horizontal momentum is absorbed by nearby matter and magnetic field , so that also a part of this becomes available for generating an outflow from the coronal hole .",
    "inevitably some of the energy goes into producing alfvn waves , and so the model may also explain the presence of alfvn waves in the solar wind .",
    "in this paper we have studied the propagation of nonlinear spherical alfvn waves . like in our previous simulations of alfvn waves in a plane - parallel atmosphere",
    "the waves damp by forming current sheets in which poynting flux is lost to ohmic heating and the acceleration of an outflow . in general",
    "most of the poynting flux is spent on accelerating an outflow .",
    "this combined process of damping alfvn waves and accelerating an outflow may be important in understanding both the fast solar wind and the winds of late - type giants .",
    "our work on nonlinear alfvn waves was begun as part of a collaborative research project between the astronomical institute , utrecht , and the fom institute for plasma physics , rijnhuizen , the netherlands .",
    "we are grateful to the other members of this collaboration , j. p. goedbloed , a. g. hearn , s. poedts and g. tth for a stimulating environment .",
    "ut is supported by an eu post - doctoral fellowship .",
