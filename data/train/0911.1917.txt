    "the model of a quantum two - level system ( tls ) , with only two relevant quantum states , is used to describe a variety of physical systems . at first",
    ", it was used in relation to spins and atomic collisions , which describe natural microscopic systems .",
    "it has been used to describe various other naturally occurring settings ever since .",
    "furthermore , some artificial mesoscopic systems that were realized recently in semiconductor quantum dots and superconducting circuits can operate as effective tlss .",
    "these solid - state tlss have received increasing attention recently for two main reasons : they exhibit fundamental quantum phenomena on macroscopic scales , and they are considered possible candidates to operate as quantum bits ( qubits ) in future quantum information processing devices .    it is quite common that the two energy levels of a quantum tls exhibit an _ avoided level crossing _ or anticrossing as some external parameter is varied , as shown in fig .  [ e(e ) ] .",
    "the physical properties of the two energy eigenstates are typically exchanged when going from one side of the avoided crossing to the other side .",
    "if the external control parameter is varied in time such that the system traverses the avoided crossing region , a non - adiabatic transition between the two energy levels can occur .",
    "the transition probability is usually named after landau and zener ( lz ) in recognition of their pioneering work on this subject , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if a lz transition is one step in a sequence of coherent processes occurring during the dynamics , not only the change in the occupation probabilities but also the change in the relative _ phase _ between the quantum states is relevant . in particular , in this review we shall focus on the situation where the control parameter is varied periodically and strongly , such that the system keeps going back and forth across the avoided crossing region . in this case",
    ", the physical observables exhibit periodic dependence on the phase acquired between the transitions @xcite .",
    "this periodicity , which is the basis of landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) interferometry , provides a useful tool that allows the characterization of the parameters defining the quantum tls and its interaction with the control fields and the environment .",
    "we note here that the formula for the single - passage transition probability can also be found in the paper majorana:1932 , and it can alternatively be named the landau - zener - stckelberg - majorana formula , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the problem of strongly driven tlss appears in a number of contexts in atomic physics . in atomic - collision problems ,",
    "the electronic state of the atom pair can experience a lz transition from the ground states of the incoming atoms into a hybridized intermediate state and then back to the electronic ground states of the outgoing atoms . in this case",
    "the avoided crossing region is passed twice @xcite , and the stckelberg phase typically has large variations and hence its interferometric consequences are washed out @xcite .",
    "an atom in an intense laser field can also experience lz transitions , but in contrast to atomic - collision problems , the atom is driven periodically in time and multiple lz transitions occur @xcite . in the case of an atom in a laser field , ( regardless of the field intensity ) if the atom is driven at a frequency that matches its energy - level splitting , it can be resonantly excited to an upper level .",
    "then , at low driving amplitudes , the level occupation probabilities experience rabi oscillations @xcite .",
    "when the driving amplitude is increased , multiphoton processes become relevant .",
    "these processes occur when the energy - level splitting matches the energy of an integer number of photons @xcite .",
    "these multiphoton processes have traditionally been described by making use of floquet theory [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; for a review see @xcite ] .",
    "in addition to controlling atomic states , resonant driving of atoms has also been studied as a means for finding atomic parameters , and the parameters of quantum systems in general coffey:1969 , henry:1977 .",
    "in addition to atomic systems , lzs interference has been studied in a number of other systems .",
    "for example , periodic dependence and time - domain oscillations related to lzs interference have been predicted in the electronic transport in semiconductor superlattices rotvig:1995,rotvig:1996 .",
    "stckelberg oscillations were also studied in superconducting quantum point contacts biased with a dc voltage and exposed to periodic driving @xcite .",
    "this effect was proposed as a sensitive tool for microwave - photon detection .",
    "another example of interference in microscopic systems arises in the study of interacting magnetic molecules [ @xcite , @xcite ] , molecular nanomagnets @xcite , and single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "interference effects have also been predicted to take place in the interlayer tunneling in quasi - one - dimensional layered materials , such as organic conductors [ cooper:2006 , @xcite ] , and in the tunneling of a periodically driven two - mode bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "recently , lz tunneling and stckelberg oscillations were measured in a gas of ultracold molecules @xcite and in the dipole - dipole interaction between rydberg atoms @xcite .",
    "avoided level crossings can also be used in the study of second - order phase transition problems @xcite .",
    "periodic driving around a phase transition can then result in interference fringes mukherjee:2009 .",
    "the lzs model has also been used to describe the singlet - triplet transition for the state of two electrons in a semiconductor double quantum dot [ @xcite , @xcite , burkard:2010 , @xcite ] as well as the transport of photons between two halves of an optical cavity divided by a dielectric membrane @xcite .",
    "recent technological advances have also allowed the realization of the strong - driving regime in superconducting qubits , where such interference has been observed in several experiments [ oliver:2005 , @xcite , @xcite , izmalkov:2008 , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "such superconducting qubit systems will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the theory of driven quantum tlss has been studied in numerous papers [ for reviews see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "some of the recent work has focused on the impact of the environment , e.g. [ ao:1991 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , nalbach:2009 ] . in particular , some papers pointed out that if the relaxation in the system is small enough , interference between multiple lz transitions becomes relevant for the system s dynamics , e.g. shimshoni:1991 , @xcite ; when the avoided crossing is passed several times , interference can take place and the dynamics is sensitive to the phase acquired between successive crossings , e.g. kayanuma:1994 .",
    "lzs interference has also been recently proposed as a possible approach to achieve perfect population transfers and to implement quantum gates for quantum - control and quantum - computing purposes [ @xcite , zhu:2001 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] [ related work on combining adiabatic lz crossings with coherent dynamics can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .    the purpose of the present review is to present the theory of strongly driven tlss and lzs interferometry and recent experimental results on the subject , particularly in relation to superconducting qubits .",
    "superconducting qubits are josephson - junction - based circuits that can behave as effective two - level systems .",
    "there are several types of superconducting qubits , differing mostly by their topology and by their physical parameters .",
    "they are generally called phase , charge , or flux qubits . for reviews",
    "see [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ] .",
    "superconducting qubits have several properties that make them unique for studying quantum effects .",
    "the qubits have mesoscopic size , which means that they allow the observation of quantum effects on a macroscopic scale",
    ". they can be integrated in electrical circuits , which provides different ways of controlling and probing their states .",
    "their parameters are adjustable : they can be tuned by changing the applied bias current , gate voltage , or magnetic flux .",
    "the qubit s state can be probed by measuring the charge or current induced in it .",
    "these unique properties of superconducting qubits allow the realization of the strong - driving regime , and they have allowed the realization of several experiments on lzs interferometry in the past few years .",
    "superconducting qubits can be used for lzs interferometry , but also to study other types of interferometry , including fano and fabry - perot interferometry [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "these latter devices can be implemented using quasi - one - dimensional open systems where photons are injected from the left and move towards the right side of the device . along the way",
    ", the photons interact with either one or two qubits acting as tunable mirrors , controlled by changing the applied electric and/or magnetic fields on the qubits .",
    "these qubits , working as tunable mirrors , can change the reflection and transmission coefficients of the photons confined in waveguides .",
    "let us first consider the case of a single superconducting qubit interacting with an incoming photon @xcite .",
    "when the energy of the incoming photon matches the energy spacing of the qubit , the photon is reflected , otherwise it is transmitted .",
    "this type of single - photon switch exhibits breit - wigner scattering : now in one dimension instead of the standard three dimensional case for natural atoms .",
    "this breit - wigner scattering produces a symmetric lorentzian peak in the reflection coefficient , versus frequency , of the photon .",
    "this situation occurs when the dispersion relation of the incoming photon is linear , as in a transmission line resonator , acting as a  rail \" guiding the motion of the photons . when the photon dispersion relation is nonlinear , for long - wavelength photons propagating in a quasi - one - dimensional array of coupled cavities , the reflection coefficient exhibits an asymmetric fano line shape , due to the interference between the continuous mode of the incoming photon and the discrete energy levels of the qubit .",
    "thus , for single - photon transport in a one - dimensional waveguide , the photons can be partially or totally reflected by a controllable two - level system which can act as a tunable mirror .",
    "it is known that the fabry - perot interferometer , which consists of two highly reflecting planar mirrors , provides the simplest cavity .",
    "it is then natural to ask the question :  is it possible to construct a quantum version of a fabry - perot interferometer ? \" namely , to build a resonator , in a one - dimensional waveguide , with two tunable - mirrors made of quantum scatterers .",
    "reference @xcite focused on this question and studied quantum analogs of the fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "they found that two separate two - level systems interacting with photons in a waveguide can also create , between them , single - photon quasi - bound states .",
    "a recent work liao:2010 studied a more complex form of interferometry , with the goal of controlling the transport of single photons by tuning the frequency of either one or two cavities in an array of coupled cavities guiding the 1d motion of photons . in some regimes",
    ", the photons can be localized around the scatterers , which act as impurities , producing isolated states in the gap of the energy spectrum [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the main subject of this review is a strongly and periodically driven tls .",
    "a quantum tls with energy bias @xmath0 and tunnelling amplitude @xmath1  is described by the hamiltonian    @xmath2    in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath3",
    "( @xmath4 is assumed throughout ) .",
    "one generally thinks of @xmath5 as being fixed by the system properties , and @xmath0 as being a tunable control parameter ; hence @xmath6 is a function of time @xmath7 and @xmath5 is not .",
    "we assume the monochromatic time - dependent bias@xmath8with amplitude @xmath9 , frequency @xmath10 and offset @xmath11 .",
    "note that this problem with the time - dependent component along the @xmath12-axis can be related to the one with the time - dependent component along the @xmath13-axis by a @xmath14-rotation around the @xmath15-axis:@xmath16the latter hamiltonian is typical for problems such as an atom in a laser field .",
    "it should also be noted that having different signs in the hamiltonian than the ones given above does not cause any nontrivial change in the results .",
    "the instantaneous eigenvalues of @xmath17 depend on the bias @xmath18 as follows:@xmath19the @xmath0-dependence of the energy levels is shown in fig .",
    "in particular , it shows an avoided level crossing at @xmath20 .     versus the bias @xmath21 .",
    "the two solid curves ( red and blue ) represent the _ adiabatic energy levels _ , @xmath22 , which display avoided crossing with energy splitting @xmath5 .",
    "the dashed lines show the crossing _",
    "diabatic energy levels _",
    "@xmath23 , corresponding to the diabatic states @xmath24 and @xmath25 . ( b )",
    "the bias @xmath26 represents the driving signal , and it oscillates between @xmath27 and @xmath28 with a sinusoidal time dependence : @xmath29.,width=8 ]    although the tls is a rather simple - looking model , concrete calculations on it can present significant difficulties .",
    "specifically , the schrdinger equation can be written as a second - order differential equation with periodic coefficients , the hill equation , which is not solvable in analytic closed form @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , different theoretical approaches can be used to obtain approximate analytical results in various parameter regions .",
    "as we shall explain in detail below , one key relation for purposes of deciding the suitability of a given theoretical approach is that between the driving frequency @xmath10 and the minimal energy splitting @xmath5 . in superconducting qubits ,",
    "both limits , @xmath30 sillanpaa:2006 and @xmath31 @xcite , have been realized in recent experiments .",
    "another key relation concerns the velocity of passing the avoided level region , which is of the order of @xmath32 ( we also introduce the adiabaticity parameter @xmath33 later in eqs .",
    "( p = p_lz-[delta ] ) ) .",
    "we will distinguish between the slow driving regime , @xmath34 , and the fast driving regime , @xmath35 .",
    "the natural representations for the two regimes are formulated in the adiabatic and diabatic bases , respectively .",
    "diabatic basis _",
    "@xmath36 is formed with the eigenstates of @xmath37 : @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( note that these states would be the eigenstates of the hamiltonian if @xmath40 vanished ) .",
    "the _ adiabatic basis _ consists of the instantaneous eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian : @xmath41 .",
    "the two bases are related to each other by the time - dependent coefficients @xmath42 ( see appendix a for details):@xmath43any given wave function of the quantum tls can be decomposed in either one of these two bases ; the coefficients in the quantum superposition are the probability amplitudes for the respective states .",
    "there are a number of theoretical approaches that can be used to study the problem of a strongly driven tls . among these approaches ,",
    "the adiabatic - impulse model , which we shall explain in detail below ( and in appendices a and b ) , is perhaps the most intuitive whenever the tls is repeatedly driven through the avoided crossing .",
    "we shall therefore put special emphasis on this theoretical approach in this review .",
    "three alternative theoretical approaches , which in certain parameter regimes can be well suited for the study of this problem , will be discussed in appendices c ( rotating - wave approximation ) , d ( floquet theory ) and e ( dressed - state picture ) .",
    "the adiabatic energy levels @xmath22 introduced in sec .",
    "i.c have a minimum distance of @xmath5 , and this minimum distance is realized at times @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ epm(t ) ] ; here @xmath47 is an integer . because the energy eigenstates , i.e.  the states of the adiabatic basis , change rather rapidly around the avoided - crossing region and are approximately constant far to the right or far to the left of that region",
    ", one would intuitively expect that the system will evolve almost adiabatically far from the points of avoided crossing and the evolution becomes nonadiabatic in the vicinity of these points .",
    "one could therefore make the approximation that beyond a certain boundary the evolution is completely adiabatic .",
    "however , it is convenient not to introduce an arbitrary boundary between the adiabatic and nonadiabatic regions and instead consider the evolution to be adiabatic everywhere except at the points of minimum energy separation , where the system experiences a sudden mixing in the populations of the two energy levels .",
    "naturally , these sudden transitions do not occur in reality .",
    "however , provided that the system follows a linear ramp traversing the avoided crossing region , one can still obtain an accurate description of the net result of the adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts of the evolution .",
    "this discretized picture only simplifies the algebra that arises in the relevant calculations . the calculation presented in appendix",
    "a can be used to obtain the appropriate assignment for the adiabatic phases and the mixing matrices at the crossing points in order to obtain the correct expressions describing the system s dynamics . following @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite and damski:2005 ) we call this picture the adiabatic - impulse approximation to emphasize the two - stage character of the model .",
    "in particular , this name emphasizes that the non - adiabatic transitions are described as instantaneous , which is just a convenient description of the continuous dynamics ; see also original articles , where the adiabatic - impulse theory was developed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .    , and the adiabatic evolution , described by the matrices @xmath48 . the acquired phases @xmath49 have a geometrical interpretation : they are equal to the area under the curves , shown by the yellow and blue regions . the diabatic energy levels , @xmath50 , are shown by the dashed lines.,title=\"fig:\",width=415 ]      the wave function @xmath51 that describes the quantum state of the tls as a function of time can be decomposed in the adiabatic basis ( see appendix a):@xmath52since in the adiabatic approximation @xmath53 are time - independent coefficients between crossings , the adiabatic evolution from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ( assuming that no lz transitions are encountered ) can be described by the evolution matrix @xmath56 , defined as follows@xmath57 in particular , the phases acquired during the adiabatic stages ( see fig .",

    "as the term theorem  suggests , the above statement is a rigorously provable statement .",
    "the tricky point is in deciding how slow the hamiltonian variation must be in order to ensure adiabaticity .",
    "the most common form of the adiabatic condition is obtained by inspecting the lz formula ( eq .  ( [ p = p_lz ] ) ) : @xmath116 , and slightly generalized forms of this condition . if the condition @xmath116 is satisfied in the lz problem , the system will almost certainly stay in the ground state , assuming it started in the ground state .",
    "the problem is that the above condition was derived for a specific problem , namely the simple lz problem , and not from general considerations that apply to any quantum system with any form of hamiltonian variation .",
    "this issue has been the subject of a number of recent papers [ @xcite , sarandy:2004 , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "for example , if a many - level system starts in an eigenstate of the hamiltonian , and then during the variation of the hamiltonian an enormously large number of avoided level crossings are encountered ( in what can colloquially be called a spaghetti  energy - level structure ) , as e.g. in [ @xcite , @xcite , garanin:2008 ] , knowing that each crossing depletes the population of the initial eigenstate by a small amount does not guarantee that the total depletion of the state from all the crossings will also be small .",
    "another example where the above simple condition does not guarantee adiabaticity over the full time evolution occurs in the simple lzs interferometry setup considered in this review .",
    "if the system is repeatedly driven back and forth across the avoided - crossing point and the phase accumulated between successive crossings is designed to produce constructive interference , the small transition amplitudes of the different crossings will add up to produce a large transition probability .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath116 , @xmath132 and @xmath210 ( i.e. , we choose the parameters to satisfy the resonance condition , eq .",
    "( construct ) ) , we know that it is only a matter of time until the ground - state population is transferred completely to the excited state and vice versa . finally , it should be emphasized that one does not need to satisfy any resonance condition of the kind given in eq .",
    "( [ res_cond ] ) .",
    "an arbitrary - looking driving signal that produces suitable phase accumulation between successive crossings will also eventually result in full population transfer between the ground and excited states . even _",
    "random _ phases will result in diffusion - like dynamics that ultimately result in large mixing between eigenstates .",
    "when discussing the adiabatic theorem , it is worth digressing for a moment to mention an idea that has received considerable attention recently , namely adiabatic quantum computing ( aqc ) @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of aqc is as follows : one subjects a physical system to a simple initial hamiltonian , such that it is guaranteed that the system will relax to its ground state .",
    "one then adiabatically changes the hamiltonian to reach a final hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the answer a given problem ( the specifics of the problem are encoded in the parameters of the final hamiltonian ) . measuring the final state",
    "then provides the answer to the problem . during the evolution from the initial to the final hamiltonian",
    ", one can expect that avoided crossing structures will be encountered , and the size and number of these avoided crossings will determine the requirements on the sweep rate .",
    "the smaller the energy gaps and the larger the number of crossings , the more slowly one has to sweep the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the traversal of the avoided crossings is governed by lz physics , and non - adiabatic lz transitions play a destructive role and should be avoided ; this was studied for a superconducting qubit e.g. in grajcar:2005 .",
    "it is currently unknown how the running time scales with system size for different problems .",
    "the answer to this question will determine whether aqc provides a computational advantage over classical computers or not . in a study that comes a step closer to the subject of the present article , it was argued in @xcite that the interaction between an aqc system and its surrounding environment could lead to a situation where the environment effectively drives the system back and forth across the avoided crossings , thus reducing the probability of remaining in the ground state .",
    "it is well known that when an atom is placed in a resonant cavity and the atom is initialized in its excited state , it emits a photon into the cavity with a rate that is proportional to the number of photons in the cavity ( more accurately , the emission rate is proportional to @xmath211 , where @xmath47 is the number of photons in the cavity ) .",
    "recently , this situation was realized in an experiment that uses a superconducting charge qubit whose energy - level structure is essentially the one that we study here @xcite .",
    "the qubit is biased such that it experiences an effective inverted relaxation taking it from the ground to the excited state .",
    "the qubit therefore constantly emits photons into the resonant cavity , and a lasing state is realized .    as discussed in @xcite , for small photon numbers the emission rate is proportional to the number of photons in the cavity , which can be seen as being a result of the fact that the rabi frequency is proportional to the square - root of the photon number .",
    "it is interesting to consider what happens if the photon number is so large that the cavity field effectively drives the qubit back and forth across the quasi - crossing region . in this case",
    "the rabi frequency is no longer proportional to the driving amplitude ( which is proportional to the square - root of the photon number ) , but it follows the bessel - function dependence that is characteristic of lzs interferometry ( see appendix c ) .",
    "one therefore has the situation where the emission rate is no longer proportional to the photon number in the cavity @xmath212 , but rather it is proportional to @xmath213 , where @xmath214 is a conversion coefficient . stimulated emission therefore exhibits oscillatory behavior , where the emission rate has regions where it increases with increasing photon number and regions where it decreases with increasing photon number .",
    "one consequence of the quasi - periodicity in the bessel function is that , with a suitable choice of parameters , there can exist several stable steady - state photon numbers in the cavity .",
    "these solutions can be obtained by comparing the emission rate into the cavity ( which follows the bessel - function dependence ) and the loss rate out of the cavity ( which is proportional to the photon number ) .",

    "if a quantum system is strongly driven , it can be excited by a multiphoton process .",
