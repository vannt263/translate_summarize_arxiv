    "one can also define a dimension vector @xmath5 which assigns to each vertex the rank of the corresponding summand . with these data",
    "the singular variety @xmath6 can be recovered as a moduli space parameterizing @xmath5-dimensional semisimple representations and in many cases a commutative resolution can be constructed by taking a moduli space parameterizing @xmath5-dimensional stable representations for some stability condition .",
    "if @xmath0 is a toric singularity , we would like our noncommutative resolution to carry an additional toric structure .",
    "this can be done by asking that all summands of @xmath2 are have rank 1 and are graded .",
    "this ensures that the moduli spaces can be constructed as toric quotients of toric varieties .",
    "if this is the case we call @xmath7 a toric noncommutative crepant resolution .",
    "an interesting problem is to classify all possible toric noncommutative crepant resolutions of a given singularity . in this paper",
    "we will describe an algorithm that does this for any toric three - dimensional gorenstein singularity .",
    "we then use a method by craw and quintero - velez @xciteto embed the quivers of these algebras inside a real 3-torus , such that the relations are precisely the homotopy relations .",
    "if the singularity is gorenstein the quiver can be projected to a 2-torus to obtain a dimer model .",
    "this is a combinatorial gadget that was originally introduced in string theory @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the power of the algorithm by looking at some special examples : singularities from reflexive polygons and abelian quotients of the conifold . in these cases",
    "we can prove that all the dimer models corresponding to such a singularity are connected by mutations .",

    "this means that the main component of @xmath100 is a toric variety and the group @xmath104 is a torus .",

    "the main questions we are interested in is the following :    *   * given a toric singularity can we find all toric nccrs / mmas ? * if the singularity is 3-dimensional and gorenstein can we find the dimer models corresponding to these nccrs ?    if @xmath107 is a direct sum of reflexive graded rank one modules and @xmath21 is any reflexive graded rank one module then @xmath108 ( because @xmath21 is invertible ) , so by tensoring with @xmath109 we can make sure @xmath0 itself is one of the summands of @xmath2 .",

    "this finiteness result implies that the problem of classifying all toric nccrs is feasible ( at least in principle ) and the first step will be to obtain a list of all graded rank 1 cohen - macaulay modules .",

    "the conifold has a unique toric nccr which corresponds to a torus tiled by @xmath373 squares .",
    "@xmath502    by lemma [ cover ]",
    "this quotient singularity then has an nccr which corresponds to tiling the torus by @xmath503 squares , but in general this is not the only nccr .",
    "e.g. for @xmath504}$ ] we get 5 nccrs :     +    these dimers all look like the first one with some additional _ diagonal arrows _ that go around in curves , ignoring orientation issues .",
    "one can solve the orientation issue by reversing the directions of the diagonal arrows pointing in the `` north - south '' directions while keeping the orientation of the diagonal arrows in the `` east - west '' directions .",
    "if one looks at the homology of these curves with coefficients in @xmath505 , one sees that the total homology is zero .",
    "this is not a coincidence .",
    "consider @xmath46 with @xmath506}$ ] .",
    "* for each dimer model of this singularity , construct an unoriented graph by forgetting the orientations of the arrows .",
    "this graph consists of the tiling of the torus by @xmath503 squares together with some additional non - intersecting diagonals . *",
    "divide the diagonal arrows in two classes @xmath507 such that the directions of the diagonals in each class are parallel .",
    "then the homology class of @xmath508 on the torus is zero . *",
    "all dimer models of @xmath0 can be torically mutated to the dimer model which tiles the torus by @xmath503 squares ( i.e. the one without diagonals ) .",
    "one can compute that @xmath509 in the fundamental domain of the torus @xmath510 there are only @xmath503 points with the property @xmath511 , so for a dimer model , every such points must have a graded rank one cohen - macaulay sitting on it .",
    "there are @xmath187 classes of graded rank one reflexives according to the equivalence class of @xmath512 .",
    "note that the class to which a graded rank one reflexives belongs depends on the @xmath513 of its point in @xmath510 because @xmath514 .",
    "the directions of the arrows in the nccr will correspond to @xmath515 where by corollary [ arrows ] all @xmath516 except for one or two consecutive @xmath266 that are @xmath106 .",
    "so in total there are eight possible directions : the straight ones ( only one @xmath517 ) and the diagonal ones ( 2 @xmath517 ) .",
    "the diagonal ones we divide in 2 classes : @xmath518 ( @xmath519 or @xmath520 ) and @xmath521 ( @xmath522 or @xmath523 ) . note that after projection onto @xmath397 all arrows in each class are ( anti)parallel .    the consistent @xmath89-charge @xmath524 assigns degree @xmath67 to the straight arrows and degree @xmath106 to the diagonal ones .",
    "the consistency condition @xmath525 implies that every vertex has precisely 2 straight arrows arriving and 2 straight arrows leaving , so ignoring orientation , the straight arrows form a square grid that tiles the torus .    the number of diagonal arrows in a vertex is either @xmath373 or @xmath187 .",
    "now consider a diagonal arrow in @xmath518 with @xmath526 and look at the next diagonal arrow @xmath147 arriving in or leaving from @xmath97 , in clockwise direction from @xmath329 .",
    "if this arrow is in @xmath518 then @xmath526 because there are @xmath373 straight arrows between @xmath329 and @xmath147 .",
    "if this arrow is in @xmath521 then @xmath527 .",
    "this implies that @xmath528 is a sum of cycles .",
    "next we show that these cycles are boundaries .",
    "consider @xmath187 points on the torus that form a grid square made of straight arrows .",
    "if the dimer model has a diagonal in that square then the @xmath373 vertices of the square that are not on the diagonal have reflexives with different @xmath194-coordinates .",
    "indeed there is a path connecting these @xmath373 vertices consisting of @xmath373 straight arrows in the same direction and a diagonal arrow .",
    "the @xmath194-coordinate of such a path is in @xmath529 .",
    "if there is no diagonal in the square or there is a diagonal connecting the two vertices then there is a path between them consisting of 2 straight arrows .",
    "the @xmath194-coordinate of such a path is in @xmath505 .",
    "from this discussion we can conclude the following :    * the diagonal arrows connecting cms with @xmath530 form the boundary between the region containing all cms with @xmath531 and the region containing all cms with @xmath532 . * the diagonals going between cms with @xmath533 form the boundary between the region containing all cms with @xmath534 and the region containing all cms with @xmath535 .    because they are boundaries the total homology with coefficients in @xmath505 is zero .",
    "if one mutates a vertex with coordinates @xmath536 then the first two new coordinates @xmath537 must be the same because the other possibilities are occupied .",
    "the third coordinate must change by @xmath67 because if @xmath538 is the direction of a straight arrow and @xmath539 is a straight arrow in the opposite direction then @xmath540 . so mutation changes the equivalence class of the vertex .",
    "now look at the torus @xmath541 of the dimer model and cut it in pieces along the diagonal arrows . if there are diagonal arrows there must be at least 2 pieces because they form boundaries .",
    "if there is a piece that is simply connected then we can perform a mutation on an internal vertex contained in a triangle ( so it borders the boundary of the simply connected piece ) . after mutation",
    "this vertex lies outside the simply connected piece , so gradually we can shrink the piece away .",
    "if there is no simply connected piece , all pieces have the topology of a cylinder and are each bounded by two curves with either the same homology class or the opposite homology class .",
    "there must be at least one cylinder piece with opposite homology classes because the total homology of the boundaries is zero .",
    "using the same procedure as above we can shrink this piece away . eventually all pieces except one have shrunk away and we are left with the dimer model consisting only of squares .",
    "we have seen that the algorithm we proposed worked for the three dimensional gorenstein case .",
    "we are now going to discuss briefly what happens in other cases .",
    "the concepts of nccr and mma were originally thought of mainly in the context of gorenstein singularities .",
    "things work differently in the non - gorenstein world . already in the 2-dimensional situation",
    ", there is no straightforward connection between minimal commutative resolutions and nccrs .",
    "if we look at a 2-dimensional abelian quotient singularity usually the nccr , which is equal to the skew group ring , has a lot more vertices than the minimal resolution has components and therefore the derived categories can not be equivalent ( see @xcite ) .    in the 3-dimensional case section [ somefacts ] still holds for non - gorenstein singularities .",
    "so the list @xmath290 produced by the algorithm will contain all graded rank @xmath106 cohen - macaulays .",
    "step 2 will now give a list of all toric modifying modules with the highest possible number of summands .",
    "however we do not know whether these modifying modules are maximal ( it might be that higher rank summands are needed to maximize them ) .",
    "we also do not know in general whether the endomorphism rings of these modules have global dimension @xmath66 , but often this is indeed what happens .",
    "let s have a closer look at a small example : @xmath542}\\ ] ] which is the simplest example from toric geometry where flips occur ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm produces one algebra : @xmath543 the quiver of this algebra has 5 arrows : @xmath66 from the first to the second vertex and @xmath373 back .",
    "one can check that the global dimension of this algebra is @xmath66 .",
    "this algebra is also connected to the dimer model of the conifold .",
    "let @xmath449 be the @xmath187 arrows of the conifold dimer with @xmath544 and @xmath545 . by comparing generators and relations",
    "one can show that the endomorphism ring @xmath546 is isomorphic to the homotopy algebra of the embedded quiver that has the same vertices as the conifold dimer but as arrows @xmath547    it is well - known that the conifold algebra can be seen as the non - commutative algebra that governs the flop @xcite .",
    "if one looks at the moduli space of @xmath548-stable @xmath549-dimensional representations @xcite of the conifold dimer then the change from @xmath550 to @xmath551 will correspond to a flop in the moduli space ."
