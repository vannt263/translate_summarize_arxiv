    "coupled - cluster theory @xcite is the most successful method used for the treatment of many - body correlations in quantum chemistry .",
    "the wavefunction is represented in exponential form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hartree - fock reference state and @xmath3 is a sum of cluster operators that build correlations into the wavefunction through single , double and higher excitations @xcite .",
    "even when the expansion of @xmath4 is truncated , coupled - cluster theory retains important properties of the exact solutions to the schrdinger equation , primarily size extensivity , and includes all contributions from all orders of perturbation theory up to the given excitation rank .",
    "coupled - cluster theory provides a systematically improvable hierarchy of polynomially scaling methods that approach full configuration interaction ( or exact diagonalization ) .    in quantum chemistry",
    ", coupled - cluster theory is typically truncated at the doubles level ( to give the so - called ccsd method @xcite ) , and the effect of triple excitations is handled perturbatively in the ccsd(t ) method @xcite .",
    "these truncated coupled - cluster theories achieve extremely high accuracy for a very wide range of problems , but fail to describe the strongly correlated states encountered in molecular dissociation or other highly degenerate situations .",
    "for example , ccsd famously fails to repair the incorrect physics of a restricted hartree - fock treatment of the dissociating n@xmath5 molecule , and the perturbative triples correction only makes matters worse .    an enormous range of approaches have been devised to address strong correlation in quantum chemistry .",
    "those that build on coupled - cluster theory do so by using a more flexible reference function @xcite ; by symmetry breaking @xcite ; by including leading terms from variational coupled - cluster theory @xcite ; through renormalization @xcite ; or through combining valence - bond theory and coupled - cluster @xcite .",
    "one could assume that ccsd is the most accurate theory possible that includes only single and double excitations from a single reference determinant , because it includes all possible diagrammatic contributions to the correlation energy within that constraint .",
    "but consider some quantity in the full theory @xmath6 that is approximated in ccsd as @xmath7 . now",
    "if @xmath8 ( for example through cancellation of @xmath9 with higher - order terms ) , it could be better to exclude the @xmath9 terms altogether and use the approximation @xmath10 instead .    in this spirit , there is a growing body of evidence that improved doubles - based schemes can be produced by leaving certain terms out of the amplitude equations , like various versions of the coupled - electron pair approximation @xcite , the @xmath11cc hierarchy @xcite and pccsd @xcite .",
    "the traditional description of antisymmetry in quantum mechanics states that @xmath12 noting that this ( or its bosonic counterpart ) is an unavoidable consequence of particle indistinguishability .",
    "the soundness of this statement has been called into question , because the notion that the classical configuration @xmath13 is different from @xmath14 distinguishes the particles from the outset @xcite .",
    "this subtlety appears to have motivated the analysis by leinaas and myrheim of the classical configuration space of indistinguishable particles , famously leading to the prediction of anyon statistics @xcite .",
    "a concrete meaning can be attached to the concept of particle interchange , as being the result of closed paths in the classical configuration space for indistinguishable particles , in which the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 are identified @xcite . for the present work",
    ", the important result from leinaas and myrheim is that although the topology of the configuration space for multiple identical particles is globally different from the euclidean product space , it is locally isometric in regions where particles are not close . to express it another way , there are no physical consequences of the indistinguishability of particles during processes in which the particles do not become close .",
    "the problems with truncated coupled - cluster theories are encountered when molecules are fragmented into separate pieces . all possible exchange processes between the fragments",
    "are considered , because antisymmetry is cemented into the structure of the theory right from the beginning , through the use of second quantization . in exact theory",
    "it makes no difference whether these exchange processes are considered or not ( but of course the exchange processes _ within _ the fragments must be treated exactly ) .",
    "here we speculate that an incomplete treatment of exchange processes , whose effect must ultimately cancel out in an exact treatment , could be the source of the pathological failure to describe dissociation in coupled - cluster theory .",
    "we have motivated removal of exchange terms between isolated fragments .",
    "there is no systematic way to do so in an orbital - invariant theory , so as a substitute we instead investigate removal of exchange terms between the 2-particle clusters formed through the application of the @xmath15 cluster operator , whilst retaining all terms arising from particle indistinguishability _ within _ clusters .",
    "we therefore turn our attention to the terms in the amplitude equation that couple together two @xmath16 amplitudes , shown in figure  [ fig : quadratic ] in the form of nonantisymmetrized goldstone diagrams .",
    "contrary to the usual convention , our interaction lines correspond to bare electron repulsion integrals , rather than antisymmetrized integrals .",

    "the only physically relevant double excitation processes are those where the two particles and two holes are associated with a single fragment .",
    "but the very cases where ccsd fails to describe dissociation are those where the restricted hartree - fock orbitals can not be localized on to the fragments .",
    "we hypothesize that the approximate description of physically irrelevant exchange processes could be the source of the poor behaviour of ccsd for dissociation .",
    "removal of diagram a@xmath17 might well improve the description in the long range  in fact it does  but it leads to parity violation because contributions of the form @xmath18{pv - diag}}}\\ ] ] are not cancelled through the corresponding diagonal component of diagram a@xmath17 . nevertheless _",
    "clusters antisymmetry is handled correctly ( the amplitudes have the correct antisymmetry ) ; it is only between clusters that parity violation is permitted .",
    "we now proceed by restoring the other desirable properties of ccd in the new theory .",
    "the quadratic portion of the ccd @xmath16 amplitude equation reads @xmath19 .",
    "the amplitude equation can be modified without compromising exactness for two - electron systems by adding @xmath20 for any parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "diagram @xmath23 is removed by setting @xmath24 , and particle - hole symmetry then requires @xmath25 , leading to the modified quadratic contribution @xmath26 .",
    "this defines the distinguishable cluster approximation with double excitations ( dcd ) .",
    "the diagrams in figure  [ fig : quadratic ] can be interpreted as a coulombic interaction between fluctuations in separate clusters ( a ) , exchange interactions between clusters ( a@xmath17 and b ) , and scattering of a particle ( or hole ) of one cluster with a fock - like potential arising from fluctuations in the other ( c and d ) .",
    "dcd can be viewed as a method in which each two - particle cluster is treated exactly in an embedding produced by other fluctuations in the system , but with neglect of exchange processes between the two - particle cluster and the environment .    to avoid the complications introduced by a full consideration of single excitations we use a brueckner formulation @xcite that rotates the occupied and virtual spaces such that the @xmath27 amplitudes vanish .",
    "the bdcd program is implemented as a variation of the bccd program @xcite in molpro @xcite .",
    "we first consider the chemically relevant situation where a low - cost correlation method that can handle strongly correlated states is of immediate importance : molecular dissociation .",

    "[ fig : dissoc ] the bdcd results for n@xmath5 and h@xmath5o dissociation are compared with other coupled cluster calculations and benchmark data from the davidson - corrected internally contracted multireference configuration interaction method @xcite ( denoted mrci+q ) . whereas ccsd , ccsd(t ) and ccsdt show increasingly poor behaviour in the strongly - correlated region , bdcd smoothly and systematically dissociates the molecules , resulting in the physically correct description of zero net force between the dissociated fragments .",

    "on the contrary , the shape of the curve around the minimum is considerably better in bdcd than in bccd ( or ccsd ) . for n@xmath5 ,",
    "the difference in harmonic frequency relative to mrci+q is 99@xmath28 for bccd but only 13@xmath28 for bdcd , and the discrepancy in the equilibrium bond length falls from 0.90pm to 0.16pm .",
    "moreover reaction energies are well described by bdcd . for a test set of small - molecule reactions @xcite calculated using the aug - cc - pvtz basis set ,",
    "the root mean squared deviation compared to ccsd(t ) is reduced from 7.6  kj / mol for bccd to 5.0  kj / mol for bdcd .",
    "we next consider hydrogen systems , which are important model problems that connect the challenges of strong correlation in the quantum chemistry of dissociating molecules with those in the description of the metal - insulator transition in condensed - matter physics .",
    "first we consider h@xmath29 using the cc - pvqz basis set .",
    "the four atoms sit on the circumference of a circle of radius 1.738 , with opposite pairs connected by diameters subtending an angle @xmath30 at the centre @xcite .",
    "for @xmath31 the electronic structure is dominated by a reference state which pairs the hydrogen atoms into molecules one way , and for @xmath32 the other .",
    "the mrci+q data can be regarded as essentially exact , and the energy goes through a maximum at @xmath33 with zero derivative .",
    "neither ccsd nor bdcd reproduce this feature exactly , both producing two different energies depending on the choice of reference state , but in bdcd the maximum is much more accurately captured , with the energy at @xmath33 being reproduced almost exactly .",
    "next we consider dissociation of the h@xmath34 ring and linear h@xmath35 using the sto-6 g basis set . in the former case",
    "the exact result ( from full configuration interaction ) is available . in the latter case exact",
    "diagonalization is unfeasible  the hilbert space has over @xmath36 dimensions  but highly accurate results @xcite can be found using the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach @xcite , owing to the linear structure . for h@xmath34",
    "it can be seen that bccd ( approximately equivalent to ccsd ) rapidly diverges from the exact result , whereas bdcd closely follows the exact curve at all distances , reproducing it exactly in the long range .",
    "for h@xmath35 agreement with dmrg is also spectacular , and to emphasize the extent of the error that bdcd has to correct we also present the reference energy from restricted hartree - fock theory .",

    "the electronic structure is relatively benign , but as the nearest - neighbour distance is increased enormous degeneracy is introduced until , at dissociation , the wavefunction is composed of around @xmath38 equally weighted determinants , from a hilbert space of @xmath39 dimensions .    for this system ,",
    "very few approximations work even qualitatively ; the restricted hartree - fock energy rises rapidly to spuriously high values ; perturbative methods produce infinities ; and coupled - cluster calculations appear impossible to converge .",
    "bdcd provides a converged energy at all separations , shown in figure  [ fig : h64 ] , smoothly dissociating to exactly 64 times the energy of the single hydrogen atom ( in the sto-6 g basis set ) .",
    "coupled - cluster theory is an exceptionally powerful framework for describing many - body correlation effects with polynomial cost .",
    "but its structure  forming a wavefunction through excitations from a single reference slater determinant  seems to preclude treatment of strongly correlated states , in which potentially vast numbers of determinants contribute with comparable weights .    motivated by speculations about the role of antisymmetry in the description of dissociated fragments , we have argued for a simple modification of the ccd amplitude equation to provide a theory that neglects certain exchange terms that must cancel out in an exact description of the dissociated system . by doing so",
    ", we also threw out terms important for the description of correlations within the fragments themselves , or in a non - dissociated molecule ; but it transpired that all of the desirable properties of ccd could be restored by other modifications .",
    "thus bdcd has @xmath0 cost , is extensive and invariant to orbital transformations ; is exact for two - electron systems , and treats particles and holes symmetrically .",
    "the resulting method does indeed describe dissociation of molecules .",
    "but perhaps more surprisingly it also improves the energetics in the bonding region , and improve energy differences such as reaction energies .",
    "most astonishing of all , though , is the fact that bdcd smoothly dissociates hydrogen lattices producing exactly the correct energy at infinite separation , a feat that should apparently only be possible using a wavefunction of immense and computationally intractable complexity .",
    "our attention is now focused on the derivation of this theory in a more rigorous theoretical framework , with the aim of treating singles , doubles and higher excitations in one systematically improvable hierarchy of distinguishable cluster theories .",
