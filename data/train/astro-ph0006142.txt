    "water cerenkov detectors have proved to be superb devices for the study of cosmic air showers  @xcite , and will constitute major components of future experiments such as the pierre auger observatory  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulation of the response of such detectors to signal and background processes is crucial for proper interpretation of the data and to aid in development of reconstruction and analysis algorithms . to address these needs",
    ", experiments have prepared dedicated detector simulations  @xcite . there may be advantages , however , in exploiting some of the efforts which the high energy physics ( hep ) community has directed at this problem .",
    "the geant3 package  @xcite , for example , was developed in order to provide hep experiments with generic tools for simulating the passage of particles through matter , but it also found substantial usage in the medical and biological sciences and in astronautics , and in fact has been studied for use in simulating water cerenkov detectors for the auger experiment  @xcite . in 1996",
    "cern initiated the geant4 project  @xcite with the goal of reproducing all the functionality of geant3 using an object oriented approach , as well as addressing some of the shortfalls of the older program .",
    "we have begun investigating the suitability of geant4 for the problem of simulating water cerenkov detectors , and report here on the status of the work .",
    "like its predecessor , geant4 provides a battery of tools to describe the geometry and material properties of an experimental setup , handle particle transport through materials and magnetic fields , and simulate particle decay and interactions with detector elements .",
    "all relevant physics processes have been included .",
    "for example , simulation of an electron traversing a material can include effects of ionisation , delta ray production , multiple coulomb scattering , bremsstrahlung and cerenkov radiation .",
    "optical photons produced by processes such as cerenkov radiation may then be subjected to rayleigh scattering , absorption , and optical boundary interactions .",
    "we note that the calculation of reflection and transmission coefficients at material boundaries takes into account the polarization state of the photon , which is important in accounting for a photon s fate as it traverses multiple optical boundaries en route to a photocathode .",
    "in addition to reproducing the functionality of geant3 , geant4 aims to improve the procedures used for geometry definition , introduction of special physics processes , visualization , and optical processes .",
    "in addition , special effort has been made to ensure tracking precision over arbitrary scales , so the package may lend itself to simulation of extensive air showers  @xcite as well as detailed detector response to ground particles .",
    "geant4 is written in c++ using an object oriented approach , and as such alleviates some of the shortcomings inherent in the procedural approach ( fortran77 ) of geant3 .",
    "geant4 strives to provide rather advanced tools for describing detector geometry , such as methods for interpreting files produced by computer aided design ( cad ) systems .",
    "however , for our application a first approximation to the geometry may be described in only a few lines of code .",
    "figure  [ fig : tank ] shows an example of an auger - style cerenkov detector which consists of a cylindrical tank filled with water .",
    "a reflective liner surrounds the water volume .",
    "three hemispherical domes at the top of the tank house photomultiplier tubes , which contain sensitive photocathode volumes that register a hit when a photon strikes .",
    "photons bounce about inside the tank until they are absorbed in the water , the tank walls , or until they enter a photomultiplier .",
    "the frequency - dependent optical properties of all these elements can be tuned to available data . in the figure ,",
    "a 1  gev muon is incident at the top of the tank , and some of the radiated cerenkov photons are shown .",
    "the detector geometry of figure  [ fig : tank ] includes a diffuse reflector to contain the cerenkov light inside the volume of water . the use of tyvek   as such a reflector has been explored by the auger experiment , and it has been noted  @xcite that the treatment of photon interactions with a rough dielectric surface as available in geant3 does not appear to be sufficient to describe the experimentally observed reflection of light from this material .",
    "geant4 provides a more flexible optical model inspired by the work of nayer _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "there it was observed that the principal features of both physical and geometrical optical models of surface reflection could be accommodated in a so - called unified model which is applicable over a wide range of surface roughness and wavelengths .",
    "the unified optical model in geant4 allows adjustment of parameters to control the relative contributions from : specular reflections about both the average surface normal and the normal of a microfacet at the surface ; the diffuse or lambertian reflection ; a possible backscatter constant ; overall surface reflectivity .",
    "figure  [ fig : light ] shows the polar angular distribution of light bouncing off such a unified surface , with contributions from the various sources identified .",
    "tuning of this model to experimental data  @xcite is underway .",
    "on a 450  mhz pentium , our program requires roughly 9 seconds to simulate the tank response to a 1  gev vertical muon .",
    "we anticipate substantial improvement in this figure , possibly through application of top - c  @xcite or parameterization tools built into the geant4 framework .",
    "a prototype simulated water cerenkov detector has been developed using geant4 .",
    "we are optimistic about the utility of this package for a number of reasons .    *",
    "the general , extensive arsenal of tools provided will allow the detail inherent in the simulation to evolve as needs are identified .",
    "on the other hand , fast parameterizations can be employed in a straightforward manner wherever details might be found to be unnecessary . *",
    "geant4 design is consistent with modern software trends . though the product is relatively new and potholes in the road",
    "should be expected , the project enjoys a large development community , which bodes well for its longevity and evolution . *",
    "several shortcomings of geant3 have been addressed in the new version .",
    "for example the surface reflection model now available is more amenable to our problem than its predecessor .",
    "we would like to thank peter gumplinger for help implementing the unified surface model .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation and conicet .",
