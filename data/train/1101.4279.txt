    "signaling in large dimensions can offer attractive benefits in wireless communications .",
    "for example , transmission of signals using large spatial dimensions in multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems with large number of transmit / receive antennas can offer increased spectral efficiencies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the spectral efficiency in a v - blast mimo system is @xmath3 symbols per channel use , where @xmath3 is the number of transmit antennas @xcite .",
    "severely delay - spread inter - symbol interference ( isi ) channels can offer opportunities to harness rich diversity benefits @xcite . in an @xmath6-length isi channel , each symbol in a frame is interfered by its previous @xmath7 symbols . however , the availability of @xmath6 copies of the transmitted signal in isi channels can be exploited to achieve @xmath6th order diversity .",
    "a way to achieve this diversity is to organize data into frames , where each frame consists of @xmath2 channel uses ( i.e. , @xmath2 dimensions in time ) , @xmath8 , and carry out joint detection / equalization over the entire frame at the receiver .",
    "a mimo - isi channel with large @xmath4 and @xmath6 ( referred to as large - dimension mimo - isi channel ) is of interest because of its potential to offer high spectral efficiencies ( in large @xmath3 ) and diversity orders ( in large @xmath6 is an ultra wideband ( uwb ) channel @xcite .",
    "uwb channels are highly frequency - selective , and are characterized by severe isi due to large delay spreads @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the number of multipath components ( mpc ) in such channels in indoor / industrial environments has been observed to be of the order of several tens to hundreds ; number of mpcs ranging from 12 to 120 are common in uwb channel models @xcite,@xcite . ] ) . a major challenge , however , is detection complexity .",
    "the complexity of optimum detection is exponential in number of dimensions , which is prohibitive for large number of dimensions .",
    "our focus in this paper is to achieve near - optimal detection performance in large dimensions at low complexities . a powerful approach to realize this goal , which we investigate in this paper , is message passing on graphical models .",
    "graphical models are graphs that indicate inter - dependencies between random variables @xcite .",
    "well known graphical models include bayesian belief networks , factor graphs , and markov random fields @xcite .",
    "belief propagation ( bp ) is a technique that solves inference problems using graphical models @xcite .",
    "bp is a simple , yet highly effective , technique that has been successfully employed in a variety of applications including computational biology , statistical signal / image processing , data mining , etc .",
    "bp is well suited in several communication problems as well @xcite ; e.g. , decoding of turbo codes and ldpc codes @xcite,@xcite , multiuser detection in cdma @xcite-@xcite , and mimo detection @xcite-@xcite .",
    "turbo equalization which performs detection / equalization and decoding in an iterative manner in coded data transmission over isi channels have been widely studied @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "more recently , message passing on factor graphs based graphical models @xcite have been studied for detection / equalization on isi channels @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown through simulations that application of sum - product ( sp ) algorithm to factor graphs in isi channels converges to a good approximation of the exact a posteriori probability ( app ) of the transmitted symbols . in @xcite , the problem of finding the linear minimum mean square error ( lmmse ) estimate of the transmitted symbol sequence",
    "is addressed employing a factor graph framework .",
    "equalization in mimo - isi channels using factor graphs are investigated in @xcite,@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "variable nodes of the factor graph correspond to the transmitted symbols , and each channel use corresponds to a function node . since the received signal at any channel use depends on the past @xmath6 symbols transmitted from every transmit antenna , every function node is connected to @xmath9 variable nodes .",
    "near - map ( maximum a posteriori probability ) performance was shown through simulations for @xmath10 systems .",
    "however , the complexities involved in the computation of messages at the variable and function nodes are exponential in @xmath9 , which are prohibitive for large spatial dimensions and delay spreads . in @xcite , a gaussian approximation of interference is used which significantly reduced the complexity to scale well for large @xmath6 .",
    "however , in terms of performance , the algorithm in @xcite exhibited high error floors shows an error floor in the approach in @xcite .",
    "whereas , in the same figure , our fg approach in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is seen to avoid flooring and perform significantly better . ] .",
    "our key contribution in this paper is the demonstration that graphical models can be effectively used to achieve _ near - optimal _ detection / equalization performance in _ large - dimension _ mimo - isi channels at _ low complexities_. the achieved performance is good because detection is performed jointly over the entire frame of data ; i.e. , over the full @xmath11 data vector . while simple approximations / simplifications resulted in low complexities , the _ large - dimension behavior _ natural in message passing algorithms contributed to the near - optimal performance in large dimensions .",
    "the graphical models we consider in this paper are markov random fields ( mrf ) and factor graphs ( fg ) .",
    "we show that these graphical models based algorithms perform increasingly closer to the optimum performance for increasing @xmath3 and increasing values of @xmath2 and @xmath6 , keeping @xmath12 fixed .    in the case of mrf approach ( section [ sec3 ] )",
    ", we show that the use of _ damping _ of messages / beliefs , where messages / beliefs are computed as a weighted average of the message / belief in the previous iteration and the current iteration ( details and associated references given in section [ sec_3d ] ) , is instrumental in achieving good performance .",
    "simulation results show that the mrf approach exhibits large - dimension behavior , and that damping significantly improves the bit error performance ( details given in section [ sec_3f ] ) .",
    "for example , the mrf based algorithm with message damping achieves close to unfaded single - input single - output ( siso ) awgn performance ( which is a lower bound on the optimum detector performance ) within 0.25 db at @xmath13 bit error rate ( ber ) in a mimo - isi channel with @xmath14 , @xmath15 channel uses per frame ( i.e. , problem size is @xmath16 dimensions ) , and @xmath17 equal - energy multipath components ( mpc ) .",
    "similar performances are shown for large - mimo systems with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( problem size @xmath20 and 2048 dimensions ) .",
    "the per - symbol complexity of the mrf approach is @xmath0 ( details in section [ sec_3e ] ) .    in the case of fg approach ( section [ sec4 ] )",
    ", the gaussian approximation of interference ( gai ) we adopt is found to be effective to further reduce the complexity by an order ( section [ sec_4a ] ) ;",
    "i.e. , the per - symbol complexity of the fg with gai approach is just @xmath1 , which is one order less than that of the mrf approach .",
    "the proposed fg with gai approach is also shown to exhibit large - dimension behavior ; its ber performance is almost the same as that of the mrf approach , and is significantly better than that of the scheme in @xcite ( section [ sec_4b ] ) .",
    "we also show that the proposed fg with gai algorithm can be used in an iterative manner with local neighborhood search algorithms , like the reactive tabu search ( rts ) algorithm in @xcite , to improve the performance of @xmath5-qam detection ( section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "though the proposed algorithms are presented in the context of uncoded systems , they can be extended to coded systems as well , through turbo equalization @xcite-@xcite ( receiver c in fig . 1 of @xcite ) or through joint processing of the entire coded frame using low - complexity graphical models ( low - complexity approximations of receiver a in fig . 1 of @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    ", we have investigated a scheme with separate mrf based detection followed by decoding ( receiver b is fig . 1 of @xcite ) in a @xmath21 large - mimo system , and showed that a coded ber performance close to within 2.5 db of the theoretical ergodic mimo capacity is achieved .",
    "mimo space - time coding schemes that can achieve separability of detection and decoding without loss of optimality @xcite are interesting because they avoid the need for joint processing for optimal detection and decoding .",
    "if such detection - decoding separable space - time codes become available for large dimensions , the proposed algorithms can be applicable in their detection / equalization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] , we present the considered mimo system model in frequency selective fading . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we present the proposed mrf based bp detector with damping and its ber performance in large dimensions .",
    "section [ sec4 ] presents the fg with gai based bp detector and its ber performance . in section [ sec5 ] , the proposed hybrid rts - bp algorithm for detection of @xmath5-qam signals and its performance",
    "are presented .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we consider mimo systems with cyclic prefixed single - carrier ( cpsc ) signaling , where the overall mimo channel includes an fft operation so that the transmitted symbols are estimated from the received frequency - domain signal ( also referred to as sc - fde : single - carrier modulation with frequency - domain equalization ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "unlike ofdm signaling , cpsc signaling does not suffer from the peak to average power ratio ( papr ) problem .",
    "also , cpsc with fd - mmse equalizer performs better than ofdm at large frame sizes ( large @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "we will see that our proposed bp based algorithms scale well for large dimensions in mimo - cpsc schemes ( large @xmath4 ) and perform significantly better than mimo - cpsc with fd - mmse equalizer as well as mimo - ofdm with mmse / ml equalizer .",
    "consider a frequency - selective mimo channel with @xmath3 transmit and @xmath22 receive antennas as shown in fig .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the number of multipath components ( mpc ) .",
    "data is transmitted in frames , where each frame has @xmath23 channel uses , out of which data symbol vectors are sent in @xmath2 channel uses @xmath24 .",
    "these @xmath2 channel uses are preceded by a cyclic prefix ( cp ) of length @xmath7 channel uses so that @xmath25 . in each channel use",
    ", an @xmath3-length data symbol vector is transmitted using spatial multiplexing on @xmath3 transmit antennas .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the data symbol vector transmitted in the @xmath27th channel use , @xmath28 . though the symbol alphabet used here is bpsk , extensions to higher - order alphabet are possible , and some are discussed later in the paper . while cp avoids inter - frame interference , there will be isi within the frame .",
    "the received signal vector at time @xmath27 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the channel gain matrix for the @xmath32th mpc such that @xmath33 denotes the entry on the @xmath34th row and @xmath35th column of the @xmath36 matrix , i.e. , @xmath33 is the channel from @xmath35th transmit antenna to the @xmath34th receive antenna on the @xmath32th mpc .",

    "note that the well known mimo system model for flat fading can be obtained as a special case in the above system model with @xmath62 .",
    "we further note that , in the considered system , signaling is done along @xmath2 dimensions in time and @xmath3 dimensions in space , so that the total number of dimensions involved is @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in low - complexity detection / equalization in large dimensions ( i.e. , for large @xmath4 ) using graphical models .",
    "the goal is to obtain an estimate of vector @xmath63 , given @xmath64 and the knowledge of @xmath65 . the optimal maximum a posteriori probability ( map ) detector takes the joint posterior distribution @xmath66 and marginalizes out each variable as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 stands for all entries of @xmath63 except @xmath69 .",
    "the map estimate of the bit @xmath69 , @xmath70 , is then given by @xmath71 whose complexity is exponential in @xmath4 . in the following sections , we present low - complexity detection algorithms based on graphical models suited for the system model in ( [ eqn1 ] ) with large dimensions , i.e. , for large @xmath2 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , keeping @xmath12 fixed .",
    "in this section , we present a detection algorithm based on message passing on a mrf graphical model of the mimo system model in ( [ eqn1 ] ) @xcite .      an undirected graph is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the set of nodes and @xmath74 is the set of undirected edges .",
    "an mrf is an undirected graph whose vertices are random variables @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the statistical dependency among the variables are such that any variable is independent of all the other variables , given its neighbors .",
    "usually , the variables in an mrf are constrained by a _ compatibility function _ , also known as a _ clique potential _ in literature .",
    "a _ clique _ of an mrf is a fully connected sub - graph , i.e. , it is a subset @xmath75 such that @xmath76 for all @xmath77 .",
    "a clique is _ maximal _ if it is not a strict subset of another clique .",
    "therefore , a maximal clique does not remain fully connected if any additional vertex of the mrf is included in it . for example , in the mrf shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are two maximal cliques .",
    "let there be @xmath80 maximal cliques in the mrf , and @xmath81 be the variables in maximal clique @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath82 be the clique potential of clique @xmath34 .",
    "then the joint distribution of the variables is given by hammersley - clifford theorem @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant , also known as _",
    "partition function _ , chosen to ensure the distribution is normalized . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with two maximal cliques in the mrf , namely , @xmath78 and @xmath85 , the joint probability distribution is given by @xmath86    _ pairwise mrf : _ an mrf is called a _ pairwise _",
    "mrf if all the maximal cliques in the mrf are of size two . in this case , the clique potentials are all functions of two variables . the joint distribution in such a case takes the form @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the clique potential between nodes @xmath69 and @xmath89 denoting the statistical dependence between them , and @xmath90 is the self potential of node @xmath69 .",
    "the mrf of a mimo system is a fully connected graph .",
    "figure [ fig2x ] shows the mrf for a @xmath91 mimo system .",
    "we get the mrf potentials for the mimo system where the posterior probability function of the random vector @xmath63 , given @xmath64 and @xmath65 , is of the form are adequate .",
    "so , we can omit the normalization constant @xmath84 , which is independent of @xmath63 , and replace the equality with proportionality in the distribution . ]",
    "@xmath92    now , defining @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we can write ( [ dist ] ) as    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the elements of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . comparing ( [ dist2 ] ) and ( [ eqnz2 ] ) , we see that the mrf of the mimo system has only pairwise interactions with the following potentials @xmath100     mimo system.,width=216,height=216 ]      the values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 given by ( [ psix1 ] ) and ( [ phix1 ] ) define , respectively , the edge and self potentials of an undirected graphical model to which message passing algorithms , such as belief propagation ( bp ) , can be applied to compute the marginal probabilities of the variables .",
    "bp attempts to estimate the marginal probabilities of all the variables by way of passing messages between the local nodes .    a _ message _ from node @xmath34 to node @xmath35 is denoted as @xmath103 , and belief at node @xmath35 is denoted as @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",

    "so , bp essentially involves computing the outgoing messages from a node to each of its neighbors using the local joint compatibility function and the incoming messages and transmitting them .",
    "the algorithm terminates after a fixed number of iterations .      in systems characterized by",
    "fully / highly connected graphical models , bp based algorithms may fail to converge , and if they do converge , the estimated marginals may be far from exact @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it may be expected that bp might perform poorly in mimo graphs due to the high density of connections .",
    "however , several methods are known in the literature , including _",
    "double loop methods _ @xcite,@xcite and _ damping _",
    "@xcite,@xcite which can be applied to improve things if bp does not converge ( or converges too slowly ) . in this paper",

    ", the evaluation of messages is taken to be a weighted average between the old estimate and the new estimate .",
    "the weighted average could either be applied to the messages ( resulting in _ message damped bp _ ) or to the estimate of the probability distribution / beliefs of the variables ( _ probability / belief damped bp _ ) , or to both messages and beliefs ( _ hybrid damped bp _ ) .",
    "it is shown , in @xcite , that the probability damped bp can be derived as a limit case in which the double - loop algorithm becomes a single - loop one .",

    "<S> in this paper , we deal with low - complexity near - optimal detection / equalization in large - dimension multiple - input multiple - output inter - symbol interference ( mimo - isi ) channels using message passing on graphical models . a key contribution in the paper </S>",
    "<S> is the demonstration that near - optimal performance in mimo - isi channels with large dimensions can be achieved at low complexities through simple yet effective simplifications / approximations , although the graphical models that represent mimo - isi channels are fully / densely connected ( loopy graphs ) . </S>",
    "<S> these include 1 ) use of markov random field ( mrf ) based graphical model with pairwise interaction , in conjunction with _ message / belief damping _ , and 2 ) use of factor graph ( fg ) based graphical model with _ </S>",
    "<S> gaussian approximation of interference _ ( gai ) . </S>",
    "<S> the per - symbol complexities are @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the mrf and the fg with gai approaches , respectively , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the number of channel uses per frame , and number of transmit antennas , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these low - complexities are quite attractive for large dimensions , i.e. , for large @xmath4 . from a performance perspective , these algorithms are even more interesting in large - dimensions since they achieve increasingly closer to optimum detection performance for increasing @xmath4 . also , we show that these message passing algorithms can be used in an iterative manner with local neighborhood search algorithms to improve the reliability / performance of @xmath5-qam symbol detection .    </S>",
