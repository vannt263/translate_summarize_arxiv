    "the strategy for simulating a @xmath270 protocol in @xmath64 is the same as before : the verifier asks for a proof of the form @xmath245 where @xmath246 ( each register consists of @xmath122 qubits ) and @xmath271 .",

    "indeed , as shown in @xcite , @xmath284 while the same is true for @xmath285 , we prove the following stronger version :    for every @xmath177 , @xmath286 [ nonlockability ]    this lemma follows by combining the inequality ( [ nonlockable ] ) with an optimal protocol for the following multipartite quantum data compression problem @xcite .",
