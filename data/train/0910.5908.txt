    "collisions of relativistic heavy - ions aim to create a unique state of matter , where quarks and gluons can move over large volumes in comparison to the typical size of a hadron .",
    "this state is known as the quark gluon plasma , qgp @xcite .",
    "measurements of jet quenching have provided strong evidence such a state is created in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider , rhic @xcite .",
    "these measurements show a suppression of hadron production at high-@xmath0 relative to p+p collisions , scaled by the number binary collisions , and the disappearance of correlated back to back hadron pairs in certain kinematic regions . how the chemistry within the jet is altered in heavy - ion collisions",
    "may provide further information on the nature of jet quenching .",
    "in particular , there are two studies which predict jet chemistry will be significantly altered in the presence of a medium .",
    "the first , by sapeta and wiedemann @xcite , shows by increasing the in - medium parton splitting probabilities in the mlla scheme , the @xmath6 and @xmath14 ratios may increase by a factor of 2 for in - medium jets .",
    "the increase in parton splitting probabilities simultaneously leads to a suppression of hadron production in the high @xmath15 @xmath16 region of the fragmentation function relative to vacuum jets .",
    "the second study , by liu and fries @xcite , shows that flavor conversions may alter the final state jet hadro - chemistry significantly . in this scheme ,",
    "hard scattered partons can exchange flavor while traversing the medium resulting in @xmath3 production being less suppressed at high-@xmath17 relative to @xmath1 production , while @xmath2 production is similarly suppressed at high-@xmath17 relative to @xmath1 production .",
    "the suppression is characterized by the nuclear modification factor , @xmath9 which is defined as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean number of binary collisions occurring in heavy - ion collisions . in the absence of jet quenching ,",
    "one naively expects @xmath20 , while if jet quenching occurs in heavy - ion collisions , @xmath21 for the applicable @xmath17 region .    in these proceedings , we report precision measurements of inclusive hadron production at high-@xmath17 for a variety of particle species in p+p and au+au @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "these measurements extend previously published spectra @xcite beyond @xmath22 gev / c .",
    "we first show the extended p+p spectra and compare our measurements to various next to leading order calculations ( nlo ) , in search of a suitable theoretical baseline to describe hadron production in p+p collisions .",
    "we then show the @xmath6 ratios in central heavy - ion collisions with a comparison to p+p , and present @xmath9 for various particle species for central collisions .",
    "finally , we show @xmath9 as a function of system size for the @xmath1 and @xmath23 particles .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the data presented from p+p @xmath5 gev collisions were collected in 2005 . in order to maximize the reach of the p+p spectra ,",
    "the data are from calorimeter triggered events which select events with high @xmath0 particles .",
    "two trigger setups were used : jet - patch , which triggers on events where a large amount of neutral energy is deposited over many calorimeter towers , and high - tower , which triggers on events where a large amount of neutral energy is deposited in a single tower .",
    "since the triggers only select a subset of events , trigger efficiency corrections are applied to present an unbiased invariant spectra .",
    "the star time projection chamber , tpc , is used to detect charged particles .",
    "the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 particles are identified via energy loss , @xmath27 , measurements in the tpc , while the @xmath28 particles are identified via their weak decay products ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 particles , like the @xmath23 particles , are also obtained via reconstruction of the respective decay products in the tpc .",
    "the charged and @xmath4 particles were obtained from jet patch trigger events , while the @xmath28 particles were obtained from high tower events .",
    "all spectra are corrected for tracking inefficiencies and acceptance .",
    "the corrections are determined by embedding monte carlo particles into real events , then counting the number which are reconstructed under various cuts which are placed on the real data .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the measurements are due to uncertainties in the trigger efficiency corrections , uncertainties in the tpc tracking efficiency / acceptance corrections , uncertainties in the raw yield extraction , and uncertainties due to the effects of finite momentum resolution .",
    "the au+au @xmath5 gev data were collected in 2004 .",
    "two trigger setups were used ; an online central trigger which obtained @xmath30 million 0 - 12% central events , and a minbias trigger which obtained @xmath30 million au+au events independent of centrality .",
    "the techniques for extracting the various spectra are the same as for the p+p data . uncertainties from the trigger efficiency corrections do not apply to the data from au+au collisions , since no trigger efficiency corrections are applied .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig1 ] shows the extended mid - rapidity @xmath3 spectra in p+p @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "the open black symbols show previously published results @xcite , and it is clear the new spectra are consistent within the overlapping @xmath17 range .",
    "we also show two nlo calculations ; one from the albino - kniehl - kramer ( akk ) @xcite , the other from the deflorian - sassot - stratmann ( dss ) @xcite .",
    "although both sets of calculations appear to reproduce the shape of the various @xmath3 spectra , there are deviations at @xmath31 gev / c . since both calculations use fits from measured @xmath3 fragmentation functions in @xmath32 collisions , these deviations maybe due to poor constraints on those fits from the data",
    ". the data in figure [ fig1 ] in conjunction with independent measurements of @xmath3 fragmentation functions ( at rhic ) should provide better constraints on models in the future .",
    "the right panel shows the mid - rapidity @xmath6 ratio as a function of @xmath17 in p+p @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "the solid black points show previously published data @xcite and again we observe a consistency with the new data . we also observe both akk and dss again fail to describe the data at high-@xmath0 .",
    "clearly , an improved theoretically baseline is needed .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig2 ] shows the mid - rapidity @xmath6 ratio as a function of @xmath17 in au+au @xmath33 @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "the p+p data are also shown for comparison .",
    "it is clear for @xmath34 gev / c , the @xmath6 ratio is enhanced in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p . in particular",
    ", the enhancement occurs at @xmath13 gev / c and persists until @xmath8 gev / c which is a clear sign jet - chemistry is indeed altered in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with expectations from the sapeta and wiedemann model @xcite , where the @xmath6 ratio is roughly a factor of 2 higher in medium jets over all hadron @xmath0 .",
    "it must be stated however the authors have yet to make specific predictions for rhic inclusive spectrum measurements .",
    "their current predictions are for lhc jets with energies above 50 gev .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig2 ] shows @xmath9 for various particles species .",
    "the au+au centrality is again @xmath33 for @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "there are a number of things to note .",
    "firstly , both @xmath10 and @xmath11 sit significantly above @xmath12 at @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "we speculate the underlying physics behind this does not relate to the higher mass of the @xmath3 or @xmath2 particles since we observe @xmath36 .",
    "it has also been shown that @xmath37 in the same @xmath0 region @xcite .",
    "we also show predictions for the @xmath23 particles with and without the previously mentioned jet flavor conversions @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 data are quantitatively consistent with the conversion scenario .",
    "however , the same scheme predicts @xmath38 which is quantitatively inconsistent with our data .",
    "finally , it is trivial to show @xmath39 results from a higher @xmath14 in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p .",
    "again , this is qualitatively consistent with expectations in the sapeta and wiedemann model @xcite .    in figure [ fig3 ]",
    ", we show the centrality dependance of integrated @xmath40 and @xmath12 in au+au @xmath5 gev collisions where @xmath41 gev / c .",
    "as expected , we observe @xmath42 for central au+au collisions , however we also note this difference persists in peripheral collisions",
    ". the @xmath6 ratio is therefore higher in peripheral collisions relative to p+p at high-@xmath0 .",
    "this raises the question whether jet chemistry is also altered in the smaller systems , or whether there is some other soft a+a production mechanism contributing in this @xmath17 range for all centralities .",
    "measurements at higher @xmath0 from future higher statistics rhic a+a runs may help in addressing these questions .",
    "in summary , we have shown extended high-@xmath0 spectra for various particle species in p+p and au+au @xmath5 gev collisions .",
    "we have found that the @xmath3 spectra are poorly described by current next to leading order calculations for @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "we also present experimental evidence for modification of jet chemistry in heavy - ion collisions relative to p+p .",
    "this is characterized by a higher @xmath6 ratio for inclusive spectrum measurements at @xmath43 gev / c in central au+au collisions , which persists until @xmath8 gev / c .",
    "the nuclear modification factor also displays a species dependance for central au+au collisions with @xmath11 and @xmath10 being higher than @xmath12 at @xmath35 gev / c .",
    "we observe the integrated @xmath10 ( @xmath44 gev / c ) is higher than @xmath12 for peripheral collisions .",
    "two models which predict changes in heavy - ion jet chemistry describe various aspects our data , however a complete quantitative description remains .",
