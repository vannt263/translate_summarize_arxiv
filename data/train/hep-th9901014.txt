    "it has become apparent recently that the duality symmetries of string theory give rise to predictions about states that are not necessarily bps @xcite . in particular , it was demonstrated by sen in @xcite that perturbative non - bps states of one theory , that are stable due to the fact that they are the lightest states carrying a given set of charges , can sometimes be identified in the dual theory as bound states of bps d - strings and anti - d - strings .",
    "alternatively , these states could be described as novel non - bps d - particles @xcite that are easily constructed using the boundary state approach @xcite .",
    "these , and perhaps other non - bps d - branes can also be naturally understood in terms of k - theory @xcite , where different states that can decay into one another lie in the same equivalence class .",
    "so far only two cases have been studied in detail . in one of them ,",
    "the perturbative non - bps state in question is a massive state in the ten - dimensional @xmath1 heterotic string that transforms in the spinor representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the dual type i state is then a @xmath2-valued non - bps d - particle @xcite .",
    "the other case involves the orientifold theory iib@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the inversion of four spatial directions .",
    "the relevant perturbative non - bps state in this case is the ground state of the string beginning on a d5-brane and ending on its image , and the dual state is a non - bps d - particle in the orbifold of type iib by @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if we compactify the latter theory on a @xmath6-torus , the orbifold is related by t - duality to type iia on @xmath7 , which in turn is the orbifold limit of a k3 surface . on the other hand , iia on k3",
    "is also related non - perturbatively to the heterotic string on @xmath0 , and it should therefore be possible to identify suitable perturbative non - bps states of the heterotic string on @xmath0 with brane states in iia on k3 .",
    "this is all the more interesting since the ( bps ) spectrum of the heterotic string is very well understood , and therefore detailed comparisons can be made .    in this paper",
    "we analyse two classes of perturbative non - bps states in the heterotic theory on @xmath0 , and relate them to non - bps states in the @xmath7 orbifold of iia .",
    "the relevant states are a non - bps d - string ( that is t - dual to the non - bps d - particle of the iib orbifold theory ) , and a non - bps ` d - molecule ' .",
    "both can be understood as non - bps bound states of bps d - branes ; in the first case tachyon condensation takes place , whereas in the second the bound state is due to an ordinary attractive force . in each case",
    ", we also analyse the stability of these non - bps states as a function of the moduli of the theory .",
    "since their masses are not protected against quantum corrections however , this analysis only holds at weak coupling in either theory , and therefore we do not expect the masses and regions of stability to be related by the duality .",
    "nevertheless , we find non - vanishing regions of stability for both types of states in both the heterotic string and the type iia string descriptions .",
    "furthermore , for the non - bps d - string these regions are closely related by the duality transformation .",
    "the orbifold limit of k3 is a rather special point in the moduli space of the theory , and it is therefore interesting to understand how the various states can be understood for a smooth k3 . to this end",
    "we also discuss how the non - bps states can be understood in terms of wrapped membranes .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section  2 the duality map between the heterotic string on @xmath0 and type iia at the orbifold point of k3 is established .",
    "this is then tested by comparing the masses of certain bps states of the two theories in section  3 . in section  4",
    "the non - bps states are analysed in both theories .",
    "we conclude and raise some open problems in section  5 .",
    "while this paper was being prepared we obtained the preprint @xcite in which the non - bps d - string of the type iia orbifold , as well as its stability and interpretation in terms of wrapped membranes , is also discussed .",

    "the heterotic string also contains non - bps states that are stable in certain domains of the moduli space .",

    "of course , since non - bps states are not protected by supersymmetry against quantum corrections to their mass , the analysis below will only hold for @xmath94 and @xmath95 in the heterotic and type iia theory , respectively .",

    "similar statements also hold for the non - bps states of the second kind in ( [ intern ] ) .",
    "we should therefore expect that the iia theory possesses a non - bps d - brane that has the appropriate charges and multiplicities .",
    "this state is easily constructed : it is the non - bps d - string of type iia , whose boundary state is given as [ d1p ] |d1_nonbps ; , > = 1 , where we have used the notation of sen @xcite .",

    "the spectrum of open strings beginning and ending on the same d - string is obtained as usual by computing the cylinder amplitude with the above boundary state , and the result is ( 1 + ( -1)^f _ 4 ) ( 1 + ( -1)^f _4 ) , [ open_d1 ] where @xmath112 is the same as @xmath4 , except that it acts on @xmath19 as @xmath113 . for each pair of orbifold points there are four d - strings , which are charged only under the two twisted sector @xmath53 s associated to the two orbifold points .",
    "these charges are of the same magnitude as those of the fractional d - particles , since the ground state of @xmath114 is the same as that of @xmath61 in ( [ d0 ] ) .",

[ nonbps_d0_strings ] in order for this to make sense as the spectrum of an actual open string theory , the normalisation should be @xmath137 . on the other hand , the magnitude of the twisted charge in ( [ d0p ] ) would then be @xmath117 in units of the twisted charge associated to the fractional bps d - particles ( [ d0 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of open strings between the non - bps d - particle and a fractional bps d - particle is the same as above , except that the overall factor is @xmath138 rather than @xmath139 . for this to make sense we need @xmath140 , rather than @xmath137",
    ". with this normalisation , the charge ( and mass ) in ( [ d0p ] )",
    "is then precisely twice the twisted charge of a fractional bps d - particle , and the state described by ( [ d0p ] ) is not stable .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the open string spectrum is now doubled , and therefore can not describe an open string that begins and ends on a single d - particle .",
    "the situation is also different from the case of the non - bps d - string in that the pair of fractional bps d - particles that carry opposite bulk charges but equal twisted charges does not exhibit a tachyonic instability , as follows from ( [ frac_d0_open ] ) .    on the other hand",
    ", one should expect that two such fractional d - particles can bind , since their interaction is of the form @xmath141 where the first term is the ten - dimensional ( bulk ) contribution , and the second term is the six - dimensional ( twisted ) contribution . unlike the case of two bps d - particles at different fixed planes , this bound state does not correspond to a new d - brane ; it is most appropriately referred to as a ` d - molecule ' .",
    "the d - molecule carries two units of twisted charge , but no bulk charge , and is therefore still restricted to the fixed plane .",
    "( this is to be contrasted with the ( threshold ) bound state of two fractional bps d - particles carrying equal bulk charges and opposite twisted charges , which corresponds to a bulk bps d - particle ) .",
    "since the above interaction comes from the one loop open string diagram , it is @xmath142 . at weak coupling",
    "the mass of the d - molecule is therefore well approximated by the mass of the two fractional d - particles , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath143 .",
    "the decay channels described above for the heterotic string correspond in iia to the decay of the d - molecule into a pair of fractional bps d - particles or into a pair of non - bps d - strings .",
    "here it is the former which is energetically forbidden . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of two non - bps d - strings is @xmath144 , and is therefore smaller than that of the d - molecule if @xmath127 .",
    "the d - molecule is thus stable in the type iia theory when @xmath128 .    unlike the non - bps d - string , the stability domains of the d - molecule are qualitatively different in the two theories , _",
    "i.e. _ at weak and strong iia coupling . at weak",
    "iia coupling only the decay into non - bps states is possible , whereas at strong iia coupling , only the decay into bps states is allowed .",
    "as the coupling is varied from weak to strong , the energy levels must therefore cross over , and we expect that at intermediate coupling , both decay channels will be available .    in the blow up to a smooth k3",
    "the d - molecule corresponds to _ two _ d2-branes wrapping a shrinking 2-cycle .",
    "the world - volume gauge field must be @xmath145 on one of the membranes , to cancel the bulk charge due to @xmath64 on the 2-cycle .",
    "the ( conditional ) stability of this particle implies that the two wrapped d2-branes should form a ( non - threshold ) bound state in a non - vanishing region of moduli space .",
    "there exist also other non - bps states in the heterotic string that are stable in certain regions of the moduli space , such as states transforming in the spinor representation of @xmath1 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath146 . in @xmath147",
    "this state has been identified with a @xmath2-valued non - bps d - particle in the dual type i string @xcite .",
    "going through the sequence of duality transformations in ( [ sequence ] ) suggests the following interpretation for this state : after the four t - dualities the d - particle becomes a non - bps d4-brane in iib on @xmath129 . under s - duality",
    "this transforms into a non - bps ( non - dirichlet ) 4-brane .",
    "the final t - duality then gives a non - bps 4-brane in iia on @xmath52 . like the type i d - particle , this 4-brane is @xmath2-valued .",
    "perhaps this 4-brane can be understood as a bound state of an ns-5-brane and an anti - ns-5-brane , in analogy with the d - brane case",
    ". however , it is not yet clear what the analogue of the tachyon condensation would be .",
    "in this paper we have analysed the duality between the heterotic string on @xmath0 and the type iia string on k3 for states that are not necessarily bps . in particular ,",
    "type iia string theory on @xmath52 , which is the orbifold limit of k3 , admits a non - bps d - string as well as a non - bps d - molecule , which are related by the duality map to perturbative non - bps states in the heterotic string , and therefore probe the duality beyond the regime of bps states . the d - string is also related by t - duality to the non - bps d - particle of the related orbifold of type iib string theory , which was constructed in @xcite .",
    "these states are not stable everywhere in moduli space .",
    "we have determined their regions of stability in both the heterotic and type iia pictures , and we have found these regions to be of non - vanishing size in both cases . for the case of the non - bps d - string ,",
    "the regions of stability are also qualitatively related by the duality map .",
    "since the masses of non - bps states are not protected by supersymmetry , this was not guaranteed a priori .",
    "it would be interesting to understand these branes in terms of the k - theoretic framework proposed by witten @xcite .",
    "more generally , it would be interesting to analyse systematically the various non - bps dirichlet - branes in orbifolds and orientifolds of type ii theories , and relate them to the k - theory predictions .",
