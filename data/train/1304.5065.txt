    "however , there is evidence that collateral requirements in bilateral credit support annexes ( csas ) lead to non - negligible residual counterparty exposures .",
    "this is particularly the case in credit derivatives contracts where jump - to - default risk is typically not covered by bilateral collateral requirements @xcite .",
    "in fact , the collapse of aig in september 2008 was triggered by cds collateral requirements it could not meet .",

    "@xcite finds that most large banks active in the otc derivatives market are under - collateralized .",
    "one of the solutions proposed for mitigating counterparty risk is the central clearing of otc derivatives .",
    "the dodd - frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 has mandated central clearing for standardized over - the - counter ( otc ) derivatives .",
    "many classes of otc derivatives are already being partially cleared through central counterparties ( ccps ) , e.g. lch clearnet for interest rate swaps ( irss ) , ice clear and cme for credit default swaps ( cds ) , fixed income clearing corp ( ficc ) for fixed - income otc derivatives and many others .",
    "the volume of otc derivatives cleared through central counterparties will most likely increase with the implementation of the dodd - frank act and increased capital requirements in basel 3 for non - cleared otc transactions .    with a ccp , a bilateral otc derivative trade between two counterparties is replaced by two symmetric trades between the ccp and each counterparty . trading otc derivatives through a ccp has some desirable effects : in a bilateral market default of one entity can spread throughout the system leading to a chain of contagious defaults @xcite .",
    "a ccp can break this chain of contagion .",
    "it has been argued that clearing trades through a ccp leads to a gain in multilateral netting among market participants in the asset class being cleared , higher transparency , risk sharing among members of the clearinghouse , no duplicative monitoring , mitigation of counterparty risk as counterparties are insulated from each other s default , a reduction in commitment frictions @xcite .",
    "moreover , by centralizing information , supervision and transparency for regulators are facilitated while retaining trade anonymity , and from a moral hazard perspective it is less problematic to bail out a ccp compared to bailing out individual banks .",

    "comparing table [ indivnotionals2010.table ] with table [ indivnotionals2009.table ] suggests that the central clearing of cdss initiated in 2009 and the resulting compression of bilateral trades led to an overall decrease of the magnitude of dealer exposures .    to understand why central clearing of otc trades can lead to such a decrease in the sum of bilateral exposures ,",
    "consider a stylized market of four participants with bilateral exposures like shown in the left part of figure [ bilateral_fig ] . in this market",
    "the sum of bilateral exposures amounts to 350 , taking into account bilateral netting . introducing a ccp",

    "for instance , if a fixed income position is hedged with an otc interest rate derivative , separate clearing of the derivative leads to larger exposure , which in return leads to larger collateral requirements .",
    "a relevant question is thus to compare the impact of these two competing effects :    * the reduction of net exposures due to multilateral netting across counterparties through central clearing , and * the increase in net bilateral exposures through the loss of netting across asset classes .    in an influential paper",
    "widely disseminated to regulators , @xcite argue that if only a subset of otc contracts is cleared in a clearinghouse , then there may be a loss of netting _ across _",

    "we find that the impact , on total expected interdealer exposure , of introducing a central counterparty for a single class of otc derivatives is highly sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of ` riskyness ' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes .",
    "in particular , while a model with independent , homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants , these conclusions are not robust to departures from the assumptions of independent and homogeneity . in fact , we find that the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness across asset classes are realistically taken into account .",
    "empirically plausible specifications of these parameters lead to the conclusion that the gain from multilateral netting in a ccp overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements .",
    "when a ccp exists for interest rate derivatives , adding a ccp for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures .",

    "whether the introduction of a clearinghouse increases or decreases net exposures depends on the particular market , e.g. the notional sizes of the asset classes , riskyness of the asset classes , correlation between the asset classes , the number of asset classes , the number of banks etc . in terms of dealer risk management",
    "our analysis underestimates the risk reduction from central clearing since we put the same risk weights on bilateral dealer exposures and exposures to a ccp . in most cases",
    "the riskyness of a ccp will be lower than that of a dealer - and hence have a smaller risk weight .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a model to quantify the ccp risk a dealer faces when participating in a ccp .    in the sequel",
    "we consider different distributional choices for the exposures , and we compare expected net exposures , value at risk ( var ) , expected shortfall and the mean of the maximum of realized exposures across dealers across various clearing scenarios .",
    "the stylized model above requires assumptions on the joint distribution of exposures .",
    "let us first consider the baseline case where @xmath19 are normally distributed for all @xmath20 and allowed to be correlated across asset classes . as in @xcite , we assume that the standard deviation of @xmath3 is proportional to the credit exposure @xmath21    [ c]lr asset class & exposure + commodity & 457 + equity linked & 706 + foreign exchange & 2,524 + interest rate & 17,533 + cds & 1,666 + other & 1,788 + total & 24,673 +    [ exposures.table ]    table [ exposures.table ] shows the gross credit exposures @xmath22 in six different asset classes as of june 2010 .",

    "but , altering the assumption on risk per dollar notional to e.g. @xmath25 in the same model , the picture is changed dramatically and the threshold number drops to 54 .",

    "<S> we study the impact of central clearing of over - the - counter ( otc ) transactions on counterparty exposures in a market with otc transactions across several asset classes with heterogeneous characteristics . the impact of introducing a central counterparty ( ccp ) on expected interdealer exposure is determined by the tradeoff between multilateral netting across dealers on one hand and bilateral netting across asset classes on the other hand . </S>",
    "<S> we find this tradeoff to be sensitive to assumptions on heterogeneity of asset classes in terms of ` riskyness ' of the asset class as well as correlation of exposures across asset classes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , while an analysis assuming independent , homogeneous exposures suggests that central clearing is efficient only if one has an unrealistically high number of participants , the opposite conclusion is reached if differences in riskyness and correlation across asset classes are realistically taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that empirically plausible specifications of model parameters lead to the conclusion that central clearing does reduce interdealer exposures : the gain from multilateral netting in a ccp overweighs the loss of netting across asset classes in bilateral netting agreements . </S>",
    "<S> when a ccp exists for interest rate derivatives , adding a ccp for credit derivatives is shown to decrease overall exposures . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are shown to be robust to the statistical assumptions of the model as well as the choice of risk measure used to quantify exposures . </S>"
