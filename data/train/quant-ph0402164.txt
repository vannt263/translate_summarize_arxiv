    "it is well known that generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) with a saturable response can support multi - stable temporal or spatial solitons in one- and multi - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the kerr nonlinearity may also prevent collapse of optical spatio - temporal solitons ( light buttes ) , in two- and three - dimensional cases @xcite .",
    "the general form of the nlse with saturable nonlinearity is ( in the temporal domain ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the local amplitude of the electromagnetic wave , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , as usual , the propagation distance and reduced time , and the function @xmath4 describes the saturable nonlinear response of the medium .",
    "the simplest form of the latter function corresponds to the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity , with the cubic and quintic terms accounting for the self - focusing and self - defocusing , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ratio of cubic and quintic nonlinearity . despite the obvious danger of the spatio - temporal collapse",
    ", we will demonstrate that reasonable results may be obtained in the latter case too .",
    "the corresponding cubic - quintic nlse ( to be abbreviated cqnlse ) describes light propagation in chalcogenide glasses @xcite and organic media @xcite , if nonlinear absorption may be neglected .",
    "in fact , cqnlse is the simplest model that makes it possible to study quantum fluctuations around bistable solitons ( and non - soliton gaussian pulses ) in systems with saturable nonlinearity , therefore results reported below may apply to a broader class of optical media than those which are directly modeled by the combination of cubic and quintic terms ( although stability of solitons is not the same in models with different forms of the saturable nonlinearity @xcite ) .",
    "the theory of quantum fluctuations around optical solitons has been developed during the past 15 years by means of several techniques , which were applied to the family of solitons in the nlse model @xcite , higher - order solitons in the same system @xcite , self - induced - transparency solitons @xcite , and bragg solitons @xcite .",
    "however , quantum theory has not yet been worked out for bistable solitons , which we aim to carry out in this work , using the cqnlse model in the simplest ( 1 + 1)-dimensional case , and applying the known _ back - propagation method _ @xcite . by means of this method",
    ", we investigate quantum fluctuations as a function of the distance passed by the pulse . a measurement scheme which should enable the observation of the predicted effects is the homodyne detection , which measures the inner product between the given pulse and a local - oscillator gauge pulse , according to the projection interpretation of the homodyne detection @xcite .",
    "first of all , we find that the optimal squeezing ratio of the quantum fluctuations around the pulse improves when both the cubic and quintic terms are of the focusing type ; on the other hand , the squeezing ratio degrades when the cubic term is focusing and the quintic one is defocusing . the quantum fluctuations around two solitons with equal widths , belonging to a bistable pair , are found to be totally different due to the effects of the quintic nonlinearity .",
    "quantum fluctuations around bistable gaussian pulses ( nonstationary ones ) will also be studied to compare the results with those for the solitons .",

    "one may expect that the soliton with a higher amplitude will be more squeezed , this is why the optimal squeezing ratio for the @xmath75 soliton is smaller than for the @xmath76one , in the beginning .",
    "but due to the defocusing effect of the quintic nonlinearity ( recall we now consider the case of @xmath65 ) , the optimal squeezing ratios for both solitons degrade after propagating a certain distance ( about @xmath77 and 4.5 soliton periods for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively ) , which leads to crossing of the squeezing - ratio curves for these bistable solitons .    for the pair @xmath25",

    "[ fig - bi - soliton ] ) , while the squeezing for the soliton with the larger amplitude , @xmath78 , is much poorer , which is naturally explained by the strong defocusing effect exerted on the latter soliton by the quintic self - defocusing term .",

    "it was found that the squeezing ratio for the soliton strongly depends on the sign of the quintic nonlinearity : the self - focusing quintic term helps to squeeze the fluctuations , while the self - defocusing one makes the squeezing poorer .",
