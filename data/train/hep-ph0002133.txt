    "<S> this leads to the conclusion that no prediction can currently be made for this quantity . for backward scattering </S>",
    "<S> the fourth - order contribution is much smaller than the third - order piece which is dominated by the anomalous scattering , and so can not explain the discrepancy between the cpt result and the current best experimental determination .    </S>",
    "<S> compton scattering from the nucleon has recently been the subject of much work , both experimental and theoretical . for the case of unpolarised protons </S>",
    "<S> the experimental amplitude is well determined , and in good agreement with the results of heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbcpt ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the situation with regard to scattering from polarised targets is less satisfactory , not least because until very recently no direct measurements of polarised compton scattering had been attempted .    </S>",
    "<S> the usual notation for spin - dependent pieces of the scattering amplitude in the breit frame is , for incoming real photons of energy @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 to outgoing real photons of the same energy energy and momentum @xmath2 , @xmath3 where hats indicate unit vectors . by crossing symmetry the functions @xmath4 are odd in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading pieces in an expansion in powers of @xmath0 are given by low - energy theorems@xcite , and the next terms contain the spin polarisabilities @xmath5 : @xmath6 where the charge of nucleon is @xmath7 and its anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> only four of the polarisabilities are independent since three are related by @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the polarisabilities are also isospin dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> none of the polarisabilities has yet been measured directly . </S>",
    "<S> the best estimates that exist at present are for forward scattering ( where only @xmath10 contributes ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 at @xmath13 , and according to the let it depends only on @xmath14@xcite . the relevant polarisability is @xmath15 , which is related via a dispersion relation to measurements at energies above the threshold for pion production , @xmath16 : _ 0=14 ^ 2 ^__0_-()-_+()^3d , where @xmath17 are the parallel and antiparallel cross - sections for photon absorption ; the related sum rule for the model - independent piece , due to gerasimov , drell and hearn@xcite , has the same form except that @xmath18 replaces @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> before direct data existed , the relevant cross - sections were estimated from multipole analyses of pion electroproduction experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these showed significant discrepancies between the let and the gdh sum rule for the difference of @xmath20 for the proton and neutron , though the sum was in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> indeed even the sign of the difference was different . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , measurements have been made with mami at mainz , for photon energies between 200 and 800  mev ; the range will be extended downward to 140  mev , and a future experiment at bonn will extend it upwards to 3  gev @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the most recent analysis using electroproduction data , which pays particular attention to the threshold region , also reduces the discrepancy somewhat @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mami data does not currently go low enough in energy to give a reliable result for the spin polarisability , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> however electroproduction data have also been used to extract this quantity ; sandorfi @xcite find @xmath22  @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath23 , while the more recent analysis of drechsel @xcite gives a rather smaller value of @xmath25  @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we shall use units of @xmath26  @xmath23 for polarisabilities from now on . )    </S>",
    "<S> the spin polarisability has also been calculated in the framework of hbcpt : at lowest ( third ) order in the chiral expansion this gives @xmath27 for both proton and neutron , where the entire contribution comes from @xmath28 loops . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the @xmath29 enters in counter - terms at fifth order in standard hbcpt , and has been estimated to be so large as to change the sign @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation has also been done in an extension of hbcpt with an explicit @xmath29 by hemmert @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they find that the principal effect is from the @xmath29 pole , which contributes @xmath30 , with the effect of @xmath31 loops being small , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly the next most important contribution is likely to be the fourth - order @xmath28 piece , and this is the result which is presented here . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the @xmath29 at nlo involve unknown parameters ; one might hope that the loop pieces at least will be small .    </S>",
    "<S> one other combination of the polarisabilities has been estimated from low - energy data for compton scattering from the proton by tonnison @xcite , namely that for backward scattering , @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is dominated by the anomalous @xmath34 exchange graph , which vanishes for forward scattering , but at third and fourth order there are also pion loop contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental value is @xmath35 with experimental and theoretical errors of about 10% each . </S>",
    "<S> the hbcpt result of hemmert   is @xmath36 , of which @xmath37 is the anomalous contribution , 4.6 is the @xmath28 piece and 2.2 comes from including the @xmath29 @xcite .    in the current paper </S>",

    "<S> the propagator with an insertion consists of both the second term in the expansion of the lowest - order propagator , @xmath52 , in powers of @xmath53 , and also the insertions from @xmath39 . </S>",

    "<S> the solid dots are vertices from @xmath39 .    to calculate the polarisabilities , it is sufficient to work in the breit frame in which the sum of the incoming and outgoing nucleon three - momenta is zero . in the centre - of - mass frame , this is not the case , and at fourth chiral order new terms appear in the amplitudes which were absent from the general form of the amplitude given by hemmert @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can , however , easily be distinguished from the terms in which we are interested because they appear to have the wrong crossing symmetry , contributing at order @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the expansions of the @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these terms in fact arise from boost corrections to the third - order contributions , the @xmath54 terms from the let pieces , and the @xmath55 terms from the third - order polarisabilities . </S>",
    "<S> there is also one other spin - dependent term  we need to remember that a under a lorentz boost , wigner rotations can generate spin - dependent amplitudes from spin - independent ones . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is of second order in the chiral expansion , in contrast to the other terms in a boost which are of first chiral order . since the thomson term for spin - independent compton scattering is of second order in hbcpt , through the wigner rotation it gives rise to a fourth - order contribution to @xmath56 in any but the breit frame .    </S>",
    "<S> returning to the breit frame , only diagrams 2a - h contribute . when the amplitudes are taylor expanded , there are contributions at order @xmath0 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the former do not violate the lets , however ; they simply provide the pieces proportional to @xmath58 necessary to satisfy the let s to fourth order . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of the various diagrams from fig .  2 to the polarisabilities are given in table 1 . </S>",
