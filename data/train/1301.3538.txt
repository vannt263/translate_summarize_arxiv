    "mott metal - insulator transitions and their associated spin and charge ordering appear throughout the physics of transition metal oxides , and present many puzzles of interpretation and modeling . since electrons in the regime of a mott transition may possess both localized and itinerant character , ambiguity may arise as to an appropriate model hamiltonian : hubbard , heisenberg , or @xmath2-@xmath3 ? anderson or kondo model ? in multi - orbital systems ,",
    "the choices are even more numerous .",
    "such a situation arises in the pseudo - cubic perovskite nickelates , _ _",
    "r__nio@xmath0 , where _ r _ is a rare earth ion , which have been studied for many years for their interesting mott metal - insulator transitions.@xcite a @xmath4 transition occurs to an insulating state for all members of the series save the case _ _",
    "r__=la , which is metallic at all temperatures , to a low temperature state with complex structural symmetry breaking  denoted `` charge order '' in the literature  and antiferromagnetism .",
    "nominally , in this material the nickel valence is @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 , which would suggest a model with a single electron in the cubic @xmath7 doublet , a two - fold orbital degeneracy .",
    "however , another interpretation is that the nickel valence is actually @xmath8 , with an additional hole per nickel spread out among the oxygen ions,@xcite analogous to the zhang - rice singlet in cuprates.@xcite in this `` ligand hole '' scenario there is no orbital degeneracy , but rather an @xmath1 spin on the nickel site , corresponding to a half - filled @xmath7 doublet .",
    "the difference between these two scenarios ( which we termed the `` nickel valence controversy '' ) is well defined only in the ionic limit where the charge on the nickel site does not fluctuate significantly , which might be the case in the ligand - hole picture .",
    "a third , compromise view is that the valence fluctuates significantly due to hybridization , making the distinction between ni@xmath9 and ni@xmath10 moot ; in this case one might build a theory in terms of the low energy bands near the fermi energy .",
    "though such a compromise exists , it seems to be unpopular , and strong opinions in favor of the ligand - hole picture are often voiced.@xcite going further , sawatzky has proposed a picture for the observed `` charge '' ordering in terms of local kondo screening of half the ni@xmath9 spins.@xcite a recent dmft paper seems to suggest a similar scenario.@xcite a physical understanding of _ how _ such kondo screening might come about , and whether it can account for the observed charge / spin order , is , however , still lacking .    in this paper , we study a concrete model motivated by the ligand - hole scenario using the numerically exact density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method.@xcite we write down the simplest model incorporating a sharply defined ni@xmath10 valence , and holes on the oxygen sites . because each nickel thereby has an @xmath1 spin and",
    "is accompanied by only a single oxygen hole with @xmath11 , this takes the form of an underscreened kondo lattice model.@xcite to enable the dmrg analysis , we take this model to be one dimensional . though this is obviously a drastic approximation , our model retains the underscreened kondo physics , and has the symmetries to allow charge ordering of the same type observed in the nickelate materials .",
    "we obtain the numerically exact full zero temperature phase diagram for this model , which contains several magnetic states .",
    "however , we _ do not _ find the charge ordered state seen in the nickelates , which is nickel site - centered , but instead a complementary type of charge ordering which is bond - centered , i.e. ordered on the oxygen sites .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this result for the nickelates in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .    beyond the context of the nickelates , our model is of interest on its own as a problem in one - dimensional physics , and of the underscreened kondo effect .",
    "recent work has shown the possibility of gapless one - dimensional `` spin liquid '' phases , which are strikingly even more non - quasiparticle in nature than the usual luttinger liquid .",
    "such phases , have been found in rather exotic models with very large ring exchange interactions.@xcite remarkably , we find evidence for such a spin liquid - like phase in our rather simple and physically motivated kondo lattice model ( technically , we obtain a phase which appears to be proximate to the `` spin bose metal '' phase of ref .  , rather than this phase itself ) .",
    "this suggests an intriguing prospect of observing quantum spin liquid states in two and three dimensional kondo lattice systems appropriate to real materials .",
    "again , this idea has already been suggested in the literature,@xcite but connections do not seem to have been made to realistic model hamiltonians .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : h_tjj ] we introduce our model hamiltonian as well as a simple semi - classical treatment that would guide our intuition about the quantum case . in sec .",

    "we shall continue to refer to the electron sites as the oxygen sites and the spin-1 sites as the nickel sites , even though our model is no longer constrained by material details .",
    "the interactions between the electrons and the nickel spins arise from virtual hoppings . at second order , after hopping to the nickel site , the electron or hole can either hop back to the original oxygen site or to the next oxygen site , which gives rise to two distinct contributions to the hamiltonian . in addition , the electron can also hop directly from one oxygen site to the next without the mediation of the nickel spin in between . taken together , this leads to the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath12 hamiltonian : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the electron operators on the oxygen site at @xmath16 with spin index @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the @xmath1 spin operator on the nickel site @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the vector of the usual pauli sigma matrices .",

    "it is worth noting that the somewhat unfamiliar @xmath12 term in @xmath26 , is analogous to the density dependent hopping term that is customarily neglected in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model.@xcite however , unlike in the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , for which at low - doping this term can be approximated by a density _ independent _ hopping , in the present case the spin variable on the nickel site remains strongly fluctuating even at low energy and thus the @xmath12 term can not be neglected .",
    "this will become evident in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmrg ] .",

    "we shall , however , restrict ourselves to the quadrant in which @xmath27 .    to gain some intuitions about the @xmath2-@xmath3-@xmath12 model ,",
    "consider a semi - classical treatment in which the nickel spins are treated as classical while the electrons remain quantum mechanical .",

    ", we argued that the qs phase is best reproduced by an interacting bosonized theory with one charge and one spin degree of freedom ( `` c1s1 '' ) , in which the spin fields carry an incommensurate wavevector .",
    "this particular interacting bosonized theory is proximate to the spin bose metal phase proposed by sheng , motrunich , and fisher@xcite .",
    "consequently , our results point to a possible route to obtain gapless quantum spin liquids with singularities at incommensurate wavevectors that does not involve the `` ring - exchange '' terms , @xcite and might pave the way for realizing such states in 1d as well as constructing similar states in higher dimensions .",
    "while we believe that the current work presents a coherent and comprehensive analysis of the system we considered , we also mention a few opportunities for further study . on the numerical side",
    ", it is clearly desirable to obtain the central charge of the qs phase from dmrg and check against the @xmath316 prediction from mean - field theory .",
    "this requires either further computation resources or improvements of the methodology .",
    "moreover , it would be helpful to check the _ projected _ energetics of the mean - field anstze we proposed , and compare them against the energy obtained from dmrg , via variation monte carlo ( vmc ) .",
    "unfortunately , because the slave - particle representation we used requires additional constraints on top of the local conservation of spinon number [ c.f .",
    ".  [ eq : constraints ] ] , such a calculation is challenging . on the analytic side",
    ", it would be desirable to develop a method that can _ directly _ obtain the cd phase from the slave - particle representation without appealing to an indirectly argument based on symmetry .",
    "we also note that there is an alternative slave - particle representation of the spin-1 spins in the literature,@xcite and it would be good to check whether results similar to those we obtained can be derived in this alternative slave - particle representation .",
    "finally , we return to the nickel valence controversy that motivated this work , which in the simplest case can be considered as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) extension of the present model . from our mean - field analysis and from general arguments on kondo problems we are quite convinced that the low - energy physics of such 3d model will still be described by an effective spin-1/2 model , which tends to exhibit static spin orders .",
    "however , the dimer phase in the effective spin-1/2 model , which we argue to correspond to the oxygen - centered charge - density order , is a special feature in 1d , and is unlikely to persist to 3d . in any case",
    ", our dmrg phase diagram shows no sign of nickel - centered charge order ( or its symmetry - equivalent order ",
    "we do not insist upon any significant charge accumulation ) , which has been interpreted as due to local kondo singlet formation .",
    "thus , the direct extension of our model to 3d is unlikely to exhibit any charge order , whether it is oxygen - centered or nickel - centered . in our opinion this points to the necessity of including explicit coupling to oxygen motions in the mechanism of charge ordering",
    ". it would be interesting to explore this directly by explicitly including lattice degrees of freedom in a model similar to ours .",
    "we leave this topic for future study .",
