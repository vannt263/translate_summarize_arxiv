    "in this paper we study pattern avoidance in words .",
    "the subject of pattern avoidance in permutations has thrived in the last decades , see @xcite and the references there . only very recently alon and friedgut @xcite studied pattern avoidance in words to achieve an upper bound on the number of permutations in @xmath5 avoiding a given pattern .",
    "we study pattern avoidance in words by defining a finite automaton that generates the words avoiding a given pattern and use the transfer matrix method to count them . by this approach",
    "we are able to find the asymptotics , as @xmath6 , for the number of words on @xmath2 letters of length @xmath3 avoiding a pattern @xmath7 , as well as exact enumeration results .",
    "in particular we re - derive regev s @xcite result on the exact asymptotics for the number of words on @xmath2 letters of length @xmath3 avoiding a pattern @xmath8 , and give the first combinatorial proof of a formula for the number of words on @xmath2 letters of length @xmath3 avoiding the pattern @xmath9 .",

    "the focus has been on enumerating and giving estimates to the number of elements in the set @xmath19 , the set of permutations in @xmath5 that avoids @xmath14 .",
    "maybe the most interesting open problem in the field is : does there exists a constant @xmath20 such that @xmath21 for all @xmath22 ?",
    "this problem is equivalent to the seemingly stronger statement , see @xcite :    [ consw ] ( * stanley , wilf * ) for any pattern @xmath23 , the limit @xmath24 exists and is finite .",
    "the conjecture has been verified for _ layered _ patterns @xcite and for all patterns which can be written as an increasing subsequence followed by a decreasing @xcite . in the latter reference alon and friedgut proved a weaker version of conjecture [ consw ] , namely : for any permutation @xmath14 there exists a constant @xmath25 such that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an extremely slow growing function , related to the ackermann hierarchy .",

    "we present the relevant definitions and attain some preliminary results , and in section [ transfer ] we use the transfer matrix method to determine the asymptotic growth for the sequence @xmath49 , which generates the words with letters in @xmath28 $ ] that avoids the increasing pattern @xmath50 . here",
