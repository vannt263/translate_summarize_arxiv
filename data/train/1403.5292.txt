    "recent discovery of a triple system harboring two white dwarfs ( wds ) and a millisecond pulsar psr j0337 + 1715 ( ransom 2014 ) is intriguing because of the complicated evolutionary history that this system must have undergone ( tauris & van den heuvel 2014 , hereafter tvdh14 ) .",
    "it also represents an interesting testbed of the newtonian dynamics which can be explored at very high accuracy .",
    "in particular , high masses of the wd companions make gravitational three body effects quite significant . a pulsar for which such study has been done previously is psr 1257 + 12 ( wolszczan & frail 1992 ) but it is orbited by three planetary mass objects ( rasio 1992 , malhotra 1993 ) .    in addition",
    ", high timing accuracy of psr j0337 + 1715 ( ransom 2014 ) makes this system well suited for studying orbital dynamics .",
    "mutual gravitational interactions between the orbiting bodies are also being explored in systems of multiple extrasolar transiting planets discovered by _",
    "kepler _ satellite , using the so - called _ transit timing variations _ ( ttvs ; e.g. mazeh 2013 ) . however , planetary transits usually have timing accuracy of order minutes , while psr j0337 + 1715 already yields median arrival time uncertainty of @xmath3s in 10 s integrations .",
    "moreover , pulsar timing has the benefit of revealing the variations of orbital parameters over the _ full orbit _ , while ttvs inform us only about the system parameters at the moments of mutual conjunctions of eclipsing bodies .",
    "our present goal is to explore secular evolution of the psr j0337 + 1715 system and to provide possible connections to its origin .",
    "this system is hierarchical in nature , with the semi - major axis of the outer binary @xmath4 cm far exceeding that of the inner binary @xmath5 cm .",
    "the two features of its present day dynamical architecture are rather intriguing .",
    "first , the orbits of the inner and outer binaries are highly coplanar : their mutual inclination @xmath6 is small but is certainly non zero .",
    "second , the orbital ellipses of the inner and outer orbits are quite well aligned : the difference of their apsidal angles is small , @xmath7 .",
    "understanding the origin of these dynamical peculiarities of the psr j0337 + 1715 system will be one of the goals of this work .",
    "we employ the notation in which all quantities related to pulsar , inner and outer binaries ( or wds ) have subscripts `` p '' , `` i '' , and `` o '' correspondingly . following conventional approach ( adopted in ransom 2014 )",
    "we assume the inner binary to consist of the pulsar and the short - period wd , while the outer binary refers to the motion of the outer wd w.r.t .",
    "the barycenter of the inner binary .",
    "we use the parameters of the system presented in ransom ( 2014 ) : pulsar and wd masses , @xmath8m@xmath9 , @xmath10m@xmath9 , @xmath11m@xmath9 , total mass @xmath12m@xmath9 , orbital periods of the inner and outer binaries @xmath13 d and @xmath14 d , eccentricities @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "unlike the psr 1257 + 12 and multi - planet systems with largest ttvs observed by _ kepler _ , psr j0337 + 1715 is a hierarchical triple and is devoid of mean motion resonances , simplifying interpretation of its dynamics . for clarity , in this work",
    "we also ignore the short - period gravitational perturbations and focus on understanding the current configuration of the system in the _ secular _ approximation ( murray & dermott 1999 ) , which consists of averaging the potentials of all orbiting bodies over their relatively short orbital periods . in this approximation the semi - major axes of the binaries stay constant on timescales longer than @xmath17 and @xmath18 . also , in the limit @xmath19 appropriate for psr j0337 + 1715 system the evolution of the orbital eccentricities decouples from the inclination evolution .",
    "in this work we focus on the eccentricity evolution .",
    "it is well known ( murray & dermott 1999 ) that in secular approximation the components of the eccentricity vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the inner and outer binaries vary in time as h_i(t)=e_i,+(g_+ t+_+)+ e_i,-(g_- t+_- ) , [ eq : h_i ] + k_i(t)=e_i,+(g_+ t+_+)+ e_i,-(g_- t+_- ) , [ eq : k_i ] + h_o(t)=e_o,+(g_+ t+_+)+ e_o,-(g_- t+_- ) , [ eq : h_o ] + k_o(t)=e_o,+(g_+ t+_+)+ e_o,-(g_- t+_- ) .

    ". the diagonal element @xmath25 of this matrix for the inner wd includes not only the secular contribution @xmath26 due to gravitational coupling to the outer wd but also the general relativistic precession term @xmath27 .",
    "all other components of @xmath24 are secular in nature .    with these values",
    "we obtain g_+2.3410 ^ -10  ^-1 ,   g_-1.29510 ^ -11  ^-1 , [ eq : g_pm ] and secular periods corresponding to these eigenvalues are p_+851  ,   g_-15,382  .",

    "remaining four parameters are fixed using the knowledge of @xmath35 at a particular moment of time .",

[ eq : in_forced ] the amplitude of the free eccentricity vector is directly related to the initial conditions and characterizes the `` own '' eccentricity of the inner binary",

    "they would be absent if the inner binary were isolated .",
    "this decomposition is illustrated in figure [ fig : inner_prec ] where we show the forced eccentricity vector at @xmath40 ( red ) and its evolution as @xmath44 goes up to @xmath45 yr ( red dashed ) in @xmath46 space .",

    "their superposition ( black ) exhibits a cycloid - like epicyclic motion with frequency @xmath42 along the guiding center following the big circle made by @xmath43 with angular frequency @xmath47 .",
    "this motion of @xmath48 results in _ non - uniform _ evolution of both @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as well as of @xmath51 ( the distance between the origin and a point on the black curve ) and of @xmath52  angle between the abscissa axis and @xmath48 .",
    "note that for the inner binary @xmath53 , since @xmath54 .",
    "this has several important implications discussed further .",
    "nonuniform evolution of the orbital elements of the inner wd is illustrated in figure [ fig : inner_prec ] where we plot @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath55 as a functions of time .",
    "the latter is computed via @xmath56 and varies considerably because @xmath57 and @xmath58 have comparable magnitudes .",
    "the present day value of the precession rate for the inner wd is _",
    "i0.02903^  ^-1 , [ eq : dvarpi_i ] which is less than either @xmath27 or @xmath42 .",
    "this is because of the small value of @xmath59 , which suppresses the effect of the fast free precession on the apsidal drift , see   [ sect : timing ] .",
    "for the outer binary the eccentricity vector is decomposed as _ o & = & * e*_o^free+*e*_o^forced , [ eq : out_decomp ] + * e*_o^free & = & e_o,-\\ {    l ( g_- t+_- ) + ( g_- t+_- )    } , [ eq : out_free ] + * e*_o^forced & = & e_o,+\\ {    l ( g_+ t+_+ ) + ( g_+ t+_+ )    } . [ eq : out_forced ] this decomposition is illustrated in figure [ fig : outer_prec ] .",
    "note that for the outer binary @xmath60 circulates at the rate @xmath47 , while @xmath61 rotates at the rate @xmath42 .",
    "compared to the inner binary , the relation between the free and forced eccentricity amplitudes is now reversed , and @xmath61 is completely negligible ( by six orders of magnitudes ) compared to @xmath60 , see inset in figure [ fig : outer_prec ] . as a result , the evolution @xmath62 is accurately represented by the free precession at constant rate @xmath47 .",
    "this is best seen in figure [ fig : outer_ev ] , where @xmath63 varies at the level of @xmath64 , while @xmath65 varies at the @xmath66 level .",
    "this is also the reason why the @xmath60 ( blue ) and @xmath62 ( black ) trajectories in figure [ fig : outer_prec ] fall on top of each other .",
    "the present day value of the precession rate for the outer wd is _",
    "o0.0234^  ^-1 , [ eq : dvarpi_o ] and is not very different from @xmath67 .",
    "small value of the forced eccentricity of the outer binary implies that its eccentricity vector @xmath62 is always very well aligned with the forced eccentricity vector of the inner binary @xmath43 , see equations ( [ eq : in_decomp])-([eq : in_forced ] ) and ( [ eq : out_decomp])-([eq : out_forced ] ) .",
    "the only significant source of misalignment between @xmath48 and @xmath62 is due to the non - zero value of @xmath41 .",
    "however , because @xmath53 this misalignment is also rather small .",
    "thus , the eccentricity vectors of both binaries are guaranteed to be _ locked in near - alignment_.    as a result , the observed close apsidal alignment between the two binaries at present epoch ( @xmath68 ) does not require unique circumstances such as observing the system at a special moment of time .",
    "the inferred misalignment is in fact close to the maximum possible max@xmath69 , given the smallness of @xmath70 .",
    "collinearity of @xmath62 and @xmath43 also explains why @xmath67 and @xmath65 are of the same order of magnitude  they would be exactly equal if @xmath41 were zero . however , because @xmath41 is not zero and period of free precession of the inner binary is shorter that that of the @xmath43 circulation , we find that @xmath67 exhibits significant variability around the value corresponding to @xmath65 , see figure [ fig : inner_ev ] .    note that these conclusions rely on the use of secular approximation and strictly speaking apply to the orbital evolution of the system on long ( @xmath71 and longer ) intervals . in reality",
    "orbital parameters of both binaries will also oscillate on shorter timescales ( e.g. @xmath18 ) due to the short - period terms in the expansion of the disturbing function ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "we can not capture such effects with our orbit - averaged approach .",
    "however , we expect the amplitude of short - term variations to be small compared to the secular ones",
    ". the general behavior of the system should still be reasonably well described by our results .",
    "millisecond radio pulsars with wd companions are known to obey the so - called _ eccentricity - period relation _ , which states that the eccentricity of the neutron star ( ns)-wd binary @xmath72 increases with its orbital period @xmath73 ( lorimer 2008 ) .",
    "phinney ( 1992 ) suggested that this correlation emerges at the last stage of the roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) leading to the formation of the wd : random density fluctuations in the envelope of the wd progenitor caused by the convective motions induce stochastic variations of the gravitational quadrupole tensor @xmath74 of the progenitor .",
    "this results in random quadrupole accelerations acting on the ns and drives eccentricity of the binary .",
    "random walk of @xmath72 is balanced by the tidal dissipation in the wd envelope , which results in a well - defined theoretical correlation between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this theory predicts , in particular , the rough equipartition between the kinetic energy of individual convective eddies in the envelope of the wd progenitor and the energy of eccentric motion of the binary .",
    "more recent compilations of the binary pulsar properties ( ng 2014 ) show that many systems deviate from @xmath75 relation suggested by phinney ( 1992 ) by orders of magnitude in @xmath72 .",
    "nevertheless , the general trend of @xmath72 increasing with growing @xmath73 is still observed , see figure [ fig : ecc_per ] in which we display properties of 72 binary pulsars with both co and he wd companions .",
    "the data are from the atnf pulsar catalogue ( manchester 2005 ) and include only ns - wd systems which do not reside in globular clusters .",
    "the system of psr j0337 + 1715 provides two tests of the @xmath75 relation , for both binaries .",
    "this is because the system must have undergone _ two _ rlof episodes , within the inner and outer binaries , to arrive to its present configuration with two wds ( tvdh14 ) .",
    "present day eccentricity of the inner binary , @xmath76 is more than two orders of magnitude larger @xmath77 implied by the @xmath75 relation of phinney ( 1992 ) , see figure [ fig : ecc_per ] .",
    "however , as mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : inner ] , almost all of this eccentricity is forced by the gravitational perturbations due to the outer wd",
    ". only the free eccentricity @xmath78 , which is much smaller than @xmath79 , carries information about the initial conditions for the evolution of the inner binary .",
    "even this low value is still about an order of magnitude higher than the prediction of phinney ( 1992 ) , see figure [ fig : ecc_per ] .",
    "however , same figure also shows several other ns - wd systems with @xmath73 of order several days and @xmath72 deviating from this relation upward by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the inner binary of psr j0337 + 1715 , while disagreeing with the theoretical @xmath75 correlation , is not an extreme outlier in the general population of the short - period ns - wd binaries .    for the outer binary the non - keplerian gravitational perturbations due to the inner binary play negligible role and its free eccentricity is essentially equal to its current eccentricity @xmath80",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude higher than @xmath81 predicted by phinney ( 1992 ) for the orbital period of @xmath82327 d , see figure [ fig : ecc_per ] . on the other hand",
    ", there is another pulsar ( psr j1822 - 0848 , lorimer 2006 ) in a similar orbit with @xmath83 d and high @xmath84 , which also strongly deviates from the @xmath75 relation , see figure [ fig : ecc_per ] .",
    "thus , systems like the outer binary of psr j0337 + 1715 are not unique and have been previously known .",
    "we now explore what do the measurements of binary eccentricities in the psr j0337 + 1715 triple tell us about the past history of the system and the @xmath72-excitation mechanisms , focussing on the theory of phinney ( 1992 ) .    during the rlof phase of the inner binary its eccentricity",
    "has already been driven by the outer wd .",
    "tidal dissipation in the inner wd damps @xmath79 on the characteristic _ circularization _ timescale ( correia 2009 ; correia 2011 ) t_tid^e & = & n_i^-1 ( ) ^5 [ eq : tidal ] + & & 1.610 ^ 5 ( ) ^5 , assuming present - day orbital parameters of the inner binary and @xmath85 given by the roche radius formula of eggleton ( 1983 ) for @xmath86 ; @xmath87 is the love number and @xmath88 is the tidal quality factor .",
    "this timescale is much longer than the characteristic secular timescale @xmath89 of the inner binary , see equation ( [ eq : p_pm ] ) .",
    "it has been shown by mardling ( 2007 ) and batygin ( 2009 ) that in these circumstances tidal dissipation drives @xmath48 towards the _ fixed point _",
    "state , in which @xmath90 is finite and fixed and apsidal lines of the inner and outer binaries are strictly aligned . in this configuration the free eccentricity of the inner binary",
    "is damped to zero by tides .",
    "one can also show that as long as @xmath91 the forced eccentricity of the inner wd is given by the expression computed in the absence of tidal dissipation .",
    "moreover , the stochastic excitation of @xmath79 by the convective eddies has likely been negligible , since it did not result in large present day value of @xmath70 .",
    "thus , during the rlof phase @xmath79 should have been close to the present - day forced eccentricity @xmath92 , if the orbital parameters of the triple did not change since then .",
    "the tidal dissipation rate due to this non - zero @xmath79 is too small to affect the semi - major axis of the inner binary  @xmath93 would appreciably change only on timescale @xmath94 yr .",
    "however , the persistent non - zero eccentricity at the rlof stage might have interesting consequences for the dynamics of the mass transfer through the inner lagrange point .    as the inner wd loses its outer envelope and accretion onto",
    "the ns ceases , @xmath95 becomes very long , about @xmath96 yr for the present - day inner wd radius @xmath97 ( ransom 2014 ; kaplan 2014 ) and @xmath98 .",
    "any @xmath70 that is imparted by e.g. the convective eddies in the vanishing envelope of the inner wd at the `` freeze - out '' moment , when @xmath95 becomes comparable to the internal evolution timescale of the inner wd , gets inherited by the binary until present time .",
    "whatever process was responsible for the eccentricity excitation , it must have been very efficient at that moment since currently measured @xmath70 considerably exceeds the prediction of phinney ( 1992 ) .",
    "anomalously high eccentricity of the outer binary might be due to the same physical mechanism that excited @xmath79 but operating during the earlier rlof phase of the outer wd ( tvdh14 ) .",
    "however , this is just a possibility .",
    "since @xmath99 , it is very hard to imagine that the inner binary has exchanged enough angular momentum with the outer one to excite @xmath100 to the present day value , especially in light of the evolutionary scenario favored by tvdh14 , in which the inner binary has always been essentially circular after the birth of the outer wd .",
    "thus , we conclude that non - zero @xmath100 was induced when the outer companion was turning into the wd , either via a very efficient version of the phinney ( 1992 ) mechanism , or by some other means",
    ".      triple nature of the psr j0337 + 1715 system presents us with a unique chance to explore excitation of the epicyclic motion in a ns - wd binary not only in the orbital plane but also _ in the direction normal to it_. measurement of the non - zero angle between the orbital planes of the two binaries , @xmath101 ( ransom 2014 ) has a potential to provide us with important clues to the processes sculpting the dynamical architecture of the system .",
    "this measurement is interesting because one expects @xmath102 to be reduced to zero during the rlof phase of the outer binary , when an accretion disk coplanar with it was engulfing the inner binary . during this stage that could have lasted for @xmath103 myr ( tvdh14 ) gravitational torques acting on the inner binary",
    "must have reduced its inclination to zero : the angular momentum deposited into the disk by the inner binary , regardless of whether it was able to clear out an inner cavity in the disk or not , gets communicated by pressure and viscous stresses out to the outer binary , effectively damping their mutual inclination ( artymowicz 1994 ; terquem 1998 ) .    after the complete orbital alignment of the two binary planes , their non - zero mutual inclination could have been excited by the same underlying mechanism as the binary eccentricity , or a completely different one . here",
    "we will focus on the former possibility , i.e. epicyclic excitation by random forces due to stochastically generated quadrupole in the convective envelope of the wd progenitor ( phinney 1992 ) .",
    "this mechanism should naturally drive out - of - plane motion .    indeed , the r.m.s .",
    "radial and vertical components of the pulsar acceleration due to stochastically varying wd quadrupole are a_r^rms= ,   a_z^rms= , [ eq : accels ] where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the r.m.s .",
    "values of the relevant diagonal and off - diagonal components of the wd quadrupole tensor .",
    "since non - zero @xmath74 is due to a superposition of many randomly varying convective eddies , one can show ( phinney 1992 ) that @xmath106 , so that = 3 ^ -1/2 , [ eq : accel_rat ] i.e. inclination is driven somewhat less efficiently than eccentricity .",
    "excitation of @xmath72 and mutual inclination @xmath107 by the wd quadrupole is balanced by the tidal dissipation and one expects ( phinney 1992 ) their equilibrium values to scale as @xmath108 , @xmath109 , where @xmath95 is given by equation ( [ eq : tidal ] ) and @xmath110 is the inclination damping time .",
    "thus , one expects ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "[ eq : ie_b ] note that this relation does not make assumptions about the physical nature of the random acceleration , however the value of @xmath111 depends on the knowledge of @xmath110 .",
    "because of tidal dissipation , over the long time interval the hierarchical triple system like psr j0337 + 1715 tends to converge to an equilibrium configuration in which the inner and outer orbits are coplanar and the inner wd obliquity @xmath112  the angle between its spin axis @xmath113 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath114 of the inner binary  is zero . in this state @xmath114",
    "is aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the outer binary @xmath115 , which dominates over @xmath114 , and the wd rotation is synchronized with the orbital motion ( we neglect the eccentricity of the inner binary ) .",
    "next we discuss the way in which convergence to this equilibrium state takes place and the value of inclination damping timescale @xmath110 . we do this for two alternative scenarios of the inclination driving , depending on whether it is excited by processes operating during the rlof phase of the inner or outer binaries .",
    "tvdh14 advocate an evolutionary scenario in which the inner wd undergoes rlof _ after _ the outer one .",
    "we explore whether the mutual inclination could have been imprinted at the end of this phase , simultaneously with the free eccentricity excitation for the inner binary .",
    "random torques driven by the convection in the wd progenitor excite both the mutual inclination of the two binaries @xmath116 ( assuming initial coplanarity ) and the obliquity of the inner wd @xmath117 .",
    "angular momentum conservation ensures that = i , [ eq : theta_i ] so that @xmath118 since @xmath119 for a synchronized wd progenitor .",
    "obliquity of the wd damps on the _ synchronization _ timescale ( correia 2011 ) t_sync , i & = & n_i^-1()^3 [ eq : t_theta ] + & & 600   , which is much shorter than the circularization timescale @xmath95 , see equation ( [ eq : tidal ] ) .",
    "because of the relation ( [ eq : theta_i ] ) mutual inclination decays due to tides on the same short timescale @xmath120 , simultaneous with the excitation by random quadrupole torques . substituting @xmath120 for @xmath110 in equation ( [ eq : ie_b ] ) we find & & ( 7)^1/2= ( 7)^1/2 [ eq : ie_b_i ] + & & 0.064  ( ) ^1/2 , where we defined @xmath121 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ie_b_i ] ) implies that even for @xmath122 the mutual inclination @xmath107 excited during the inner binary rlof should be _ much smaller _ than the free eccentricity of the inner wd , at the level of @xmath123 .",
    "this is because spin angular momentum of the pulsar companion is much smaller than the orbital angular momentum of the binary .",
    "however , the present day value of @xmath124 is about an order of magnitude _ higher _ than @xmath70 , @xmath125 , exceeding the prediction ( [ eq : ie_b_i ] ) by more than two orders of magnitude , see the upper limit at @xmath17 in figure [ fig : ecc_per ]",
    ".    the discrepancy can in fact be even worse as the assumption of @xmath126 suggested by the estimate ( [ eq : accel_rat ] ) may be too optimistic .",
    "indeed , the final value of @xmath102 gets established at the freeze - out time when @xmath120 becomes comparable to the wd evolution timescale at a stage when mass transfer stops and @xmath127 becomes smaller than the roche radius .",
    "since @xmath128 and @xmath120 scales with @xmath129 slower than @xmath95 , the inclination freeze - out must occur _ considerably later _ than the eccentricity freeze - out of the inner binary .",
    "at that stage convective envelope of the wd progenitor is less massive than at @xmath79 freeze - out , resulting in less vigorous quadrupole fluctuations and @xmath130 being likely smaller than @xmath131 was when @xmath79 attained its final value .    as a result , one should expect @xmath132 , exacerbating the discrepancy between the theoretical and measured values of @xmath102 .",
    "for these reasons we believe that the present day mutual inclination could not have been established at the end of the rlof phase of the inner binary .",
    "in conclusion we would like to address a subtle point related to the energy equipartition between individual convective eddies and the binary epicyclic motion .",
    "phinney ( 1992 ) has shown that the mean energy of the random epicyclic motion in the binary plane @xmath133 ( @xmath134 is the reduced mass , @xmath135 is the keplerian speed ) is of order the kinetic energy of an individual eddy driving @xmath74 fluctuations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ie_b_i ] ) then suggests that the mean energy of the random epicyclic motion normal to the binary plane @xmath136 and is not in equipartition with individual convective eddies .",
    "this paradox is easily resolved when one notices that inclination variations unavoidably cause much larger obliquity variations of the wd progenitor , see equation ( [ eq : theta_i ] ) . because both are driven by equal ( but opposite ) torques , the energy stored in the obliquity wobble of the pulsar companion @xmath137 must be larger than @xmath138 by a factor @xmath139 . using equations ( [ eq : accel_rat ] ) and ( [ eq : ie_b_i ] )",
    "one then trivially finds that @xmath140 .",
    "thus , the full binary energy @xmath141 associated with the out - of - plane torques is in fact in equipartition with the kinetic energy of individual eddies in the wd progenitor envelope .",
    "results of  [ sect : inn_rlof ] can be trivially extended to study the possibility of the mutual inclination excitation by the random @xmath74 fluctuations during the rlof phase of the _ outer _ binary .",
    "the same logic applies in that case as well if we consider inner binary as a point mass ( which is reasonable for an hierarchical system ) and replace @xmath142 and @xmath143 in all equations . as a result , we find that random fluctuations of the mutual inclination during the outer rlof get damped on timescale t_sync , o & = & n_o^-1()^3 [ eq : t_theta_o ] + & & 1.610 ^ 5   , assuming the present day masses of all components .",
    "if we follow tvdh14 and adopt @xmath144 and @xmath145 ( mass of the inner wd progenitor ) during the outer binary rlof , prior to the inner rlof episode , this timescale does not change significantly , @xmath146 yr .",
    "this is shorter than the expected duration of the outer rlof phase , @xmath103 myr ( tvdh14 ) .",
    "analogously , equation ( [ eq : ie_b_i ] ) becomes & & ( 7)^1/2 [ eq : ie_b_o ] + & & 0.08  ( ) ^1/2 , where we used @xmath147 for @xmath148 . adopting the parameters of the inner binary before its rlof phase we get @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and essentially the same value of @xmath151 .",
    "this estimate shows that if the observed outer binary eccentricity @xmath152 was excited by randomly varying @xmath74 of the wd progenitor at the end of the rlof phase , then the same process must have given rise to the mutual inclination @xmath153 .",
    "this can be easily reconciled with the present day value of @xmath154 ( see the upper limit on @xmath107 at @xmath18 in figure [ fig : ecc_per ] ) if either @xmath155 , which is quite plausible for an extended wd progenitor in long - period orbit , or @xmath156 , which is also expected , as we described in  [ sect : inn_rlof ] .",
    "however , this comparison of @xmath107 and the current mutual inclination @xmath102 is meaningful only if @xmath107 did not change since the outer binary rlof phase , which may have occurred @xmath157 gyr ago ( tvdh14 ) .",
    "mutual inclination would decay because for non - zero @xmath107 the steady state obliquity @xmath112 of the inner pulsar companion ( wd or its progenitor ) does not converge to @xmath158 .",
    "instead , tidal dissipation in the companion drives the system towards the so - called cassini state ( colombo 1966 ; peale 1969 ) , in which the companion spin vector @xmath113 , the angular momentum of the inner binary @xmath114 , and the total angular momentum of the system @xmath159 are coplanar and precess at the same rate @xmath26 .",
    "convergence of the companion spin to this configuration happens on relatively short synchronization timescale @xmath120 given by equation ( [ eq : t_theta ] ) .",
    "obliquity in the low - obliquity cassini state ( the one relevant for our purposes ) is non - zero and is given in the case of weak dissipation by @xmath160 ( ward & hamilton 2004 ) , where the dimensionless parameter _",
    "i & = & ( ) ^3 ( ) ^3 [ eq : lambda_i ] + & & 1.110 ^ 4 ( ) ^3 is the ratio of the pulsar companion spin precession rate to the nodal precession rate of the inner binary",
    ". tidal dissipation affects the value of @xmath161 ( fabrycky 2007 ) but for @xmath162 the effect is small and will be neglected .",
    "the numerical estimate in equation ( [ eq : lambda_i ] ) applies during the inner binary rlof , when @xmath163 . during other evolutionary phases",
    "@xmath129 is smaller and @xmath164 is lower .",
    "but in any case it is reasonable to expect @xmath165 so that @xmath166 .",
    "non - zero obliquity in presence of tidal dissipation results in a torque acting on the inner binary , which over time damps the mutual inclination @xmath107 of the two orbits .",
    "its evolution is described by ( correia 2011 ) = - , [ eq : iev ] where @xmath167 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 settles into a cassini state before @xmath107 has a chance to change . plugging the dissipationless @xmath168 for the cassini state into equation ( [ eq : iev ] )",
    "we find that subsequently @xmath107 decays on a timescale t_i^cas & = & _ i t_i = n_i^-1 ( ) ^3 ( ) ^2 , [ eq : t_i ] + & & 12   ( ) ^2 , see equation ( [ eq : tidal ] ) .",
    "now we need to distinguish two possibilities .",
    "first , tvdh14 favor evolutionary scenario in which the inner binary underwent rlof phase _",
    "after _ the outer one . given the scaling @xmath169 one expects fastest @xmath107 decay to occur during the rlof .",
    "but even then the estimate ( [ eq : t_i ] ) shows that @xmath170 is much longer than the expected duration of the inner rlof episode , @xmath171 gyr ( tvdh14 ) . as a result ,",
    "mutual inclination does not decay during this phase by more than @xmath172 .    before and after that phase , the inner wd or its progenitor have @xmath129 smaller than during the overflow , resulting in much longer @xmath170 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 stays constant during these time intervals .",
    "second , tvdh14 also do not exclude the possibility of the outer wd to be the _",
    "last _ one to form via the rlof , after the inner wd has already formed . in this case",
    "@xmath129 is always very small and @xmath170 is much longer than the lifetime of the system .",
    "high degree of the orbital coplanarity of the system also strongly argues against the outer binary eccentricity @xmath100 being excited by some external process , e.g. gravitational perturbation by a passing star .",
    "such perturbation is expected to excite @xmath107 on par with @xmath100 so that an encounter driving @xmath100 two orders of magnitude stronger than @xmath102 seems extremely improbable .",
    "needless to say , stellar encounter is in any case highly unlikely for an object in the field as excitation of @xmath173 would require stellar passage within @xmath174 au from the system ( heggie & rasio 1996 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the combination of arguments presented here and in  [ sect : inn_rlof ] does not contradict the scenario in which the present day mutual inclination @xmath102 was excited by convectively - driven random @xmath74 fluctuations at the end of the outer binary rlof phase , simultaneous with the excitation of its eccentricity @xmath100 . on the other hand",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that @xmath107 and/or @xmath100 were produced by a mechanism completely unrelated the stochastic @xmath74 variations of the wd progenitor , e.g. as a result of incomplete damping of the mutual misalignment by disk torques during the outer binary rlof .",
    "this possibility may be hinted at by the large difference between @xmath100 and the prediction of phinney ( 1992 ) , see  [ sect : p - e ] .",
    "finally , the weak decay of mutual inclination after its excitation in the outer binary does not allow us to distinguish between the two alternative evolutionary scenarios presented in tvdh14 , in which the outer wd is either the first or last one to form .",
    "strong newtonian three - body coupling between the components of psr j0337 + 1715 system should make the measurement of the general relativistic effects in it difficult , even despite the high timing accuracy of this pulsar ( ransom 2014 ) .",
    "in particular , as shown in  [ sect : inner ] apsidal precession of the inner binary is no longer set by the gr precession alone but is instead strongly suppressed by the three - body effects , so that @xmath175 .    at the same time , we find that measurement of @xmath67 is quite sensitive to the actual value of @xmath27 .",
    "artificially varying @xmath27 by @xmath176 results in roughly @xmath177 variation of @xmath67 .",
    "this is especially surprising given that @xmath27 provides only a @xmath178-contribution to @xmath25 , see equations ( [ eq : a_in])-([eq : omgr ] ) .",
    "such a disproportionate response can be understood if one manipulates the expression for @xmath67 using solutions ( [ eq : h_i])-([eq : k_i ] ) and the fact that @xmath179 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . as a result ,",
    "one can write the following expression for the apsidal rate of the inner binary at the present time : _ i(0)a_i+b_i , [ eq : varpinow ] where @xmath48 and @xmath62 are the eccentricity vectors of the inner and outer binaries at present day .",
    "this formula clearly shows the near cancellation of the two large contributions ( two terms in the r.h.s . ) , since @xmath180 according to our estimate ( [ eq : dvarpi_i ] ) .",
    "because of that even a small variation in the value of @xmath25 in equation ( [ eq : varpinow ] ) , e.g. due to the deviation of @xmath27 from the gr prediction ( damour & taylor 1992 ) , drives large change in the value of @xmath67 . thus , given a significantly accurate measurement of @xmath67 one may still be able to use timing of psr j0337 + 1715 to constrain non - gr contributions to the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary , even in presence of the three - body effects",
    ". the problem may be in measuring @xmath67 accurately enough , given the low value of @xmath79 ( ransom , private communication ) .",
    "another complication for timing may arise from the short - term effects , neglected in our calculations .",
    "small variations of the orbital parameters on the orbital timescales of both binaries may be at least partly degenerate with the post - newtonian contributions to timing ( damour & deruelle 1986 ; damour & taylor 1992 ) .",
    "this is likely to make the problem of extracting post - newtonian parameters of the system quite challenging .",
    "we studied secular dynamics of a recently discovered triple system containing radio pulsar psr j0337 + 1715 and two wds .",
    "three body interactions play important role in the dynamics of this hierarchical system .",
    "gravitational perturbations due to the outer wd endow the inner binary with a large forced eccentricity and strongly suppress its apsidal precession rate @xmath67 , to about @xmath0 of the rate predicted by the general relativity . at the same time",
    ", @xmath67 is still quite sensitive to the non - newtonian contribution to the precession rate and may be used to constrain alternative gravity theories provided that a good measurement of @xmath67 is available .",
    "small value of the free eccentricity @xmath1 of the inner binary compared to the forced one and vanishing forced eccentricity of the outer , eccentric binary naturally result in apsidal near - alignment of the two binaries .",
    "these results help understand the evolutionary pathways leading to the current dynamical configuration of the system .",
    "free eccentricity of the inner binary exceeds the value predicted by the theoretical period - eccentricity relation of phinney ( 1992 ) by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , both the inner and outer binaries of this hierarchical triple belong to the population of the ns - wd binaries exhibiting eccentricity in excess of that predicted by phinney ( 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , the non - zero mutual inclination @xmath102 between the two orbits provides us with a unique chance to explore the _ anisotropy _ of epicyclic motion excitation in ns - wd binaries .",
    "we find it unlikely that @xmath102 was excited , simultaneous with eccentricity , by random torques due to convective eddies in the wd progenitor during the rlof in the inner binary .",
    "on the other hand , the smallness of the mutual inclination compared to the outer binary eccentricity argues in favor of simultaneous excitation of @xmath102 and @xmath100 by random torques during the outer binary rlof . inclination driven during this phase should persist until now despite the complexity of the intermediate evolutionary stages .",
    "these facts may provide useful clues for understanding epicyclic excitation in the ns - wd binaries in general ."
