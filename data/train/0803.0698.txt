    "the situation with the decoupling of the adjoint fields we encounter here seems counterintuitive , at least at first sight .",
    "indeed , on physical grounds we can say that once @xmath125 becomes larger than @xmath66 by a factor of , say , 5 or so the adjoint fields are already decoupled , and the subsequent evolution of their mass from @xmath126 to infinity should have no impact in the bulk as well as on the string worldsheet .",

    "then , of course , the parameter @xmath78 can be viewed as arbitrary .",

    "the same tube metric @xmath130 appears ( as in ( [ 41 ] ) , ( [ esigma ] ) ) and the point @xmath131 is interpreted as a transition point between two distinct phases .",
