    "circumstellar disks are closely associated with star formation , with both strong observational evidence for their ubiquitous presence around young stars , and theoretical support as a natural consequence of angular momentum conservation in rotating , star - forming cores ( e.g. , beckwith et al .",

    "disk lifetimes are short compared to stellar lifetimes , and dust disks around solar mass stars are estimated to typically last @xmath12 myrs ( e.g. , haisch et al . 2001 ) .",
    "gas disk lifetimes are not as well constrained observationally ( @xmath13 yrs , zuckerman et al .",
    "1995 , pascucci et al . 2006 ) but are presumably similar to dust disk lifetimes .",
    "these timescales set an upper limit on the time available for the assembly of planetary systems .",
    "furthermore , dust emission studies that are commonly used to probe disk evolution indicate that disks transition from an optically thick stage characterised by strong accretion and high ratios of total infrared to bolometric luminosities ( @xmath14 , classical t tauri star , ctts ) to a weakly accreting phase with optically thin dust ( @xmath15 , weak - line t tauri star , wtts ) ( e.g. , see recent review on dust disk evolution by watson et al . 2007 ) . based on the statistics of these two classes of objects ,",
    "the transition epoch is estimated to be very brief , @xmath16myr , and may involve optically thin inner disks with optically thick outer regions ( hillenbrand 2008 , cieza 2008 ) .",
    "optically thick gas and dust disks thus originate during the star formation process , undergo significant evolution over a few myrs to perhaps also form planets , and are rapidly destroyed during the planet formation process .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed to date in order to explain the nature of disk dispersal ( see hollenbach et al .",
    "2000 and dullemond et al .",
    "2007 for recent reviews ) .",
    "disk matter builds planetary systems .",
    "however , it has long been recognized from considerations of the total gas and solid content of the solar system and by comparing initial disk masses ( @xmath17 ) to the observed inventory of planet mass ( @xmath18 ) around extrasolar systems that much of the mass is , in fact , physically removed from the disk either to spiral into the central star or to disperse back into the interstellar medium ( e.g. , hayashi et al .",
    "viscous accretion is known to occur in the disk and allows transport of mass onto the central star , but is insufficient as a dispersal mechanism in itself .",
    "viscosity also spreads the disk , as a small amount of matter carries angular momentum outward , and viscous disks do not completely disappear at @xmath19 10 myr , as observed ( gas masses @xmath20 m@xmath21 , e.g. , zuckerman et al .",

    "the slow decline in mass of a viscously evolving disk ( @xmath23 , e.g. hartmann et al . 1998 ) is moreover inconsistent with the observationally inferred rapid transition from the ctts to wtts phases .",
    "one of the most promising mechanisms heretofore proposed for destroying disks has been photoevaporation , where the high energy radiation from a young star heats gas at the disk surface and results in escaping mass flows from the outer regions of disks . in this scenario ,",
    "viscous evolution causes the inner disk to accrete onto the central star and to spread , while photoevaporation removes the outer disk mass reservoir .",

    "alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) considered x - rays from the central star and found that they were unlikely to lead to significant photoevaporation rates ( also see ercolano et al . 2008 ) .",
    "clarke et al . (",
    "2001 ) were the first to combine euv - induced photoevaporation from a central solar mass star with turbulent viscosity to follow disk evolution .",
    "they found that euv photoevaporation produces a gap at a characteristic radius @xmath26 au once the viscous accretion through the disk has declined to a rate @xmath27 m@xmath9 yr@xmath28 , below the photevaporation rate from that region for typical euv fields ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the timescale for producing the gap was estimated as @xmath19 a few myrs for sufficiently high euv fields and small initial disk masses . at this point",
    "the inner disk rapidly accretes onto the central star on a viscous timescale ( @xmath30 myr ) , followed by the rapid photoevaporation of the outer disk by the unattenuated euv flux from the central star ( alexander et al .",

    "photoevaporation due to the irradiation of a disk by fuv photons from a central low mass star has not been studied earlier .",
    "fuv and x - ray luminosities of young low mass stars are significant and better determined than their euv luminosities , which can not be directly observed . in young low mass stars , fuv , euv and x - ray fluxes are far in excess of older main sequence low mass stars like the sun .",
    "this is due to both enhanced magnetic activity on stellar surfaces , which leads to much higher chromospheric activity and production of energetic photons , and to the presence of substantial accretion ( in accretion columns , gullbring et al .",
    "1998 , calvet & gullbring 1998 ) onto the central star from the disk , which leads to accretion shocks producing energetic photons .",
    "although fuv , euv , and x - rays are produced near the stellar surface , they may be absorbed before reaching the disk surface .",

    ", we include the effects of fuv and x - ray radiation from the central star on disk photoevaporation .",
    "this is a preliminary study and our main goal is to assess the importance of fuv radiation on disk evolution and lifetimes .",
    "we therefore make many necessary simplifications , notably the use of steady - state , static models of the chemical abundances , gas and dust temperatures , and density structure followed by a simple `` streamline '' analysis of the photoevaporative flow .",
    "we investigate the relative importance of optical , fuv , euv and x - ray radiation from the central star in inducing photoevaporation by using our recently developed disk models ( gorti & hollenbach 2008 , hereafter gh08 ) .",
    "we present models of disks around central star masses of @xmath34 m@xmath9 that span the range of current observational disk detections ( e.g. , luhman et al . 2005 , fuente et al .",
    "2006 , manoj et al .",
    "we consider disks in their initial stages , with moderate grain growth and power law surface density profiles .",
    "we calculate photoevaporative mass loss rates from the disk as a function of relevant model parameters such as the dust opacity per h nucleus , the fuv luminosity , the x - ray luminosity and the power law exponent of the surface density distribution .",
    "although our results are for a snapshot in time , we qualitatively estimate the effects of viscosity and discuss disk evolution and dispersal . the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present a brief overview of disk evolution prior to the onset of photoevaporation and describe our disk models and photoevaporation calculations . in  3 we discuss our results and their implications for disk lifetimes , and describe disk evolution as a function of various input parameters .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  4 .",
    "we consider the stage in the star formation process when disk illumination by fuv photons and x - rays is likely to commence . during the gravitational collapse of the protostellar core and the formation of a central star and circumstellar disk , accretion of mass onto the star",
    "proceeds mainly through the disk . in this earliest phase of stellar evolution ,",
    "average accretion rates are very high ( @xmath35yr ) and there is complete obscuration of the uv and x - rays from the central star by infall onto the inner disk and the star . during this phase ,",
    "disk accretion and transport of angular momentum may be accomplished by global gravitational phenomena such as spiral density waves , as the disk hovers on the brink of gravitational instability .",
    "it is likely that accretion rates through the disk and onto the star are comparable with infall rates onto the disk . as infall onto the disk ceases , and",
    "the disk continues to accrete onto the star , the ratio of disk mass / stellar mass decreases and the self - gravity of the disk becomes less important .",
    "turbulent viscosity may then provide the means of angular momentum transport and the disk mass declines , the disk spreads and the accretion rate on to the star steadily drops ( najita et al .",
    "2007 , bouvier et al .",
    "2007 , watson et al . 2007 ) .",
    "disk illumination by fuv and x - rays commences once they can penetrate the protostellar wind originating in the inner disk .",
    "accretion onto the star and stellar magnetic activity provide sources of energetic photons . there is a significant output of energetic photons from the star due to the accretion hotspots on its surface ( fuv , and perhaps euv and soft x - rays , e.g. calvet & gullbring 1998 , robrade & schmitt 2006 , gdel et al .",
    "2007 ) and due to chromospheric activity ( bulk of x - ray emission , e.g , preibisch et al .",
    "2005 and likely euv , alexander et al . 2005 ) .",
    "accretion is also accompanied by protostellar winds originating from the inner disk that are proportional to the rate of accretion ( @xmath36 , white & hillenbrand 2004 ) .",
    "considerable amounts of high energy radiation from the star are initially absorbed at the base of the accretion column and in the wind ( e.g , muzerolle et al .",
    "as accretion diminishes , the opacity of the stellar outflow and the wind from the inner disk is low enough that the outer regions of the disk are irradiated by stellar optical , fuv and x - ray photons .",
    "accretion shock - generated fuv and soft x - ray photons are observationally inferred to at least partially penetrate the accretion column ( e.g. , muzerolle et al .",
    "2003 , robrade & schmitt 2006 ) , and have been measured around many young stars ( e.g. , iue observations for fuv , valenti et al .",
    "the hydrogen nucleus column density of gas necessary for absorption of x - rays ( @xmath37 ) and fuv ( @xmath38 , dependent on dust opacity in the protostellar wind ) is larger than for euv absorption ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "x - rays and fuv photons therefore penetrate the wind and begin to irradiate the disk at earlier epochs than euv photons .",
    "hollenbach & gorti ( 2008 ) show that the fuv and x - ray photons begin to penetrate the wind once the accretion rate drops below @xmath40 m@xmath9 yr@xmath41 myr ) , while euv photons penetrate the wind only when the accretion rate drops below @xmath42yr ( @xmath43myr ) .",
    "the main input parameters to the model are the stellar mass , radiation field , the gas phase abundance of elements , the surface density distribution of gas and dust , and the dust properties in the disk . in this paper",
    ", we calculate the disk structure and photoevaporative mass loss rates at a characteristic time ( @xmath44 myr ) during the planet - forming disk evolutionary epoch . from the mass loss rates , we estimate disk dispersal times .",
    "we therefore use input parameters such as stellar radiation field and dust properties that are representative of this characteristic time .",

    "we do not consider lower mass central objects , although infrared excesses have been noted around objects with masses as low as @xmath46 .",
    "it is rather uncertain as to whether stars more massive than @xmath47 harbor disks around them ( e.g. , fuente et al . 2007 , manoj et al . 2007 ) .",

    "our results are more in agreement with the results of alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and we find that x - ray photoevaporation in itself is not very effective in dispersing the disk .",
    "we emphasize that x - rays can nevertheless affect the mass loss rates from the disk via the above indirect effect of raising the degree of ionization in the disk and increasing the efficiency of fuv - induced grain photoelectric heating , and in cases with high x - ray luminosities , promote the formation of gaps in the inner @xmath201 au disk .",
    "dust opacity is an important parameter influencing disk structure , and we investigate how this affects disk photoevaporation rates . as disks evolve ,",
    "dust grains are believed to coagulate and grow and perhaps settle ( e.g. , van boekel et al .",
    "2005 , natta et al .",
    "2007 ) reducing the opacity per h nucleus in the disk .",
    "fuv photoevaporation originates close to the @xmath248 layer , and reducing the dust opacity may be expected to increase the photoevaporation rate due to the associated increase in gas density at the @xmath248 layer . on the other hand ,",
    "lower dust opacity implies lower fuv heating by the grain photoelectric effect , which would decrease the photoevaporation rate .",
    "dust settling also causes a reduced flaring of the disk ( dullemond & dominik 2005 ) , and hence decreases the amount of high energy radiation intercepted by the disk , perhaps decreasing the photoevaporation rate .",
    "we study these effects by varying the dust cross section per h atom .",
    "we keep our dust grain size distribution fixed ( from 50 -20@xmath79 m ) , and model a reduction in dust opacity by increasing the gas / dust mass ratio by a factor of 100 .",
    "we also decrease the pah abundance in proportion to the reduction in dust opacity .",
    "we find that @xmath216 decreases with a reduction in dust opacity ( fig .",
    "[ pedust ] ) , suggesting that as the disk evolves and grains settle and grow , the disk might lose its gas even more rapidly . however , the effect is not large , as seen in fig .",
    "[ pedust ] , with @xmath216 only increasing by a factor of 2 , for a factor of 100 increase in dust opacity .",
    "note that settling timescales depend on disk radius , and are typically longer in the outer disk where fuv photoevaporation dominates .",
    "our derived disk lifetimes are typically short , @xmath44 myrs , so that dust in the outer disk may not have adequately settled or undergone grain growth to significantly affect disk survival times .",
    "we also consider a model with a steeper surface density distribution profile with radius ( @xmath249 ) compared with the standard disk model ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we find that a steeper density distribution increases the disk lifetime , and that this effect is due to the resulting change in the disk structure . steeper surface density distributions cause less flaring of the optically heated dust disk ( e.g. , dullemond 2002 ) , which results in a smaller angle being subtended by the disk and thereby reduced interception of the fuv and x - ray flux from the star .",
    "we note that even steeper profiles may result in the outer disk being partially or completely shadowed by the inner disk , perhaps limiting the rate at which mass loss can occur .",
    "photoevaporation of the outer disk may occur until the surface density distribution is steeper than @xmath56 at which self - limiting point the outer disk is shielded by the inner disk , and the photoevaporation rate significantly declines .",
    "however , in our present 1 + 1d dust radiative transfer model , we can not investigate this effect and future 2d models are needed .",
    "disks may also be shielded from incident fuv radiation if there are corrugations or ripples in the density distribution caused , for example , by spiral density waves .",
    "we do not consider such effects at present .",
    "we also note that future time - dependent models are needed to investigate how the surface density distribution evolves as it loses mass due to fuv / x - ray photoevaporation , and how @xmath197 and @xmath216 are affected by the changing surface density profile in the disk .",
    "we next investigate the possibility that the disk lifetime is dependent on the mass of the central star .",
    "if disk mass loss rates are determined by fuv photoevaporation due to the central star , a peak in disk survival time with mass could possibly arise .",
    "low mass stars may have lower initial disk masses than high mass stars , and their disks are more weakly bound by the stellar gravitational field .",
    "disk lifetimes may therefore increase with stellar mass for low to intermediate mass ( m@xmath250 ) stars . for massive stars ( m@xmath251m@xmath9 ) ,",
    "most of the photospheric stellar emission is in the fuv ( 7 m@xmath252m@xmath253m@xmath9 ) or in the euv ( m@xmath254m@xmath9 ) and their fuv or euv luminosities are high .",
    "this may lead to very short disk lifetimes due to photoevaporation .",
    "it may be expected that disk lifetimes gradually increase with @xmath255 , peak at intermediate stellar masses ( @xmath256 ) and then rapidly drop at higher masses ( m@xmath251m@xmath9 ) .",
    "disk lifetimes may have a direct bearing on the likelihood of planet formation in the disk , which may then be a function of stellar mass .",
    "we test the hypothesis that disk lifetimes show a peak with @xmath255 with models of disks around stars of different stellar masses , and show below that although disks around high mass stars are short - lived , those around stars from @xmath8m@xmath9 have approximately equal lifetimes .",
    "the fuv luminosity of stars is a highly variable quantity for stars of low mass where the fuv does not arise from the photosphere , and can range over orders of magnitude for a given stellar mass . in lieu of any definitive observational data characterizing fuv luminosity as a function of stellar spectral type or mass",
    ", we use a mass - accretion defined fuv flux as described in gh08 , i.e. we use the empirically derived accretion rate vs. mass relation of muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) and assume that @xmath257 .",
    "we normalize this to the `` median '' accretion rate for a 1 myr old solar mass star , @xmath258 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "we then convert @xmath228 into an accretion luminosity following the procedures of gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . for massive stars ,",
    "a significant portion of the fuv flux arises from the photosphere .",
    "it should be noted that due to the uncertain nature of the accretion - generated fuv spectrum , our results are inherently of a qualitative nature .",
    "table  [ starpar ] summarizes all the parameters we adopt for the different stellar masses .",
    "we additionally include a 30m@xmath9 case where the disk photoevaporation rate is entirely driven by the euv radiation from the star and use the analytical results of hjls94 to estimate disk lifetimes .",
    "recall that we assume the initial disk mass m@xmath259 is proportional to the stellar mass , m@xmath260 .",
    "this assumption together with the empirical criterion @xmath261 , implies that the viscosity parameter @xmath64 increases with stellar mass ( see table 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ mdotmass ] shows the calculated mass loss rates @xmath262 for the range of stellar masses considered here .",
    "evidently , @xmath263 does not monotonically increase with stellar mass , even though the fuv luminosity is an increasing function of stellar mass .",
    "there is a peak at the gravitational radius in each case , which shifts to larger radii for more massive stars .",
    "the gravitational radius @xmath71 increases with the mass of the star .",
    "this implies that in order to escape the higher gravitational fields , gas temperature in the flow needs to be higher at a given radius for higher mass stars .",
    "gas temperature , however , is only a weak function of the strength of the fuv field .",
    "therefore , lower mass stars have lower gravitational fields that only loosely binds their lower disk mass , but even with their lower fuv luminosities can heat the gas sufficiently to cause significant photoevaporation . on the other hand , the luminosities of very massive stars are photospheric in origin and significantly higher than accretion - generated fuv luminosities of intermediate and low mass stars , which are a fraction of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "strong euv and fuv fluxes from massive stars can therefore erode their disks rapidly .",
    "we find that disk lifetimes @xmath216 do not depend on the mass of the central star for @xmath8m@xmath9 stellar masses .",
    "we calculate @xmath216 as described in  3.1 for each disk model .",
    "figure  [ mdotmass ] also shows the disk lifetime @xmath216 as a function of stellar mass for our small sample of disk models .",
    "however , @xmath216 drops sharply for both massive stars we consider , the 7m@xmath9 star and the 30m@xmath9 star with euv photoevaporation .",
    "these disks are very short - lived with @xmath264 years .",
    "our result of a short disk survival time ( @xmath265 years ) for the most massive stars is supported by the observational evidence of the rarity of disks around stars more massive than @xmath19 7m@xmath9 ( e.g. , fuente et al .",
    "2007 , manoj et al . 2007 ) .",
    "massive stars may indeed lose their disks very rapidly due to their strong fuv and euv fields .",
    "we do not find @xmath216 increasing with stellar mass from @xmath8m@xmath9 mainly because the fuv photons that dominate photoevaporation are generated by accretion , characterised by the relation @xmath261 .",
    "note that the heating at the flow surface in the @xmath266m@xmath9 case ( which has very low fuv ) is by optical heating of dust grains which then collide with and heat gas .",
    "therefore , even though low mass ( @xmath267 ) stars start with less massive disks , and these disks are weakly bound , the much lower fuv for the lower mass stars also decreases photoevaporation rates and leads to lifetimes comparable to those for @xmath268m@xmath9 stars .",
    "we conclude with the caveat that this result is very dependent on the various assumptions made in the analysis .",
    "although our choice of model input parameters was guided by observational constraints , in many cases the existing data is not definitive .",
    "a different choice of input parameters , for example , initial disk mass proportional to @xmath269 , or @xmath270 , may result in a peak in disk lifetimes with stellar mass .",
    "our analysis involves assumptions that affect the value of @xmath64 in the disk , affecting @xmath177 , and hence the derived disk lifetimes .",
    "furthermore , @xmath64 may vary both as function of disk radius ( @xmath69 ) as well as disk height ( @xmath75 ) due to varying ionization levels caused by mri activity , and we consider a constant @xmath64 throughout the disk .",
    "our results are hence qualitative in nature .",
    "observational evidence for a peak in disk lifetimes as a function of mass is not very conclusive .",
    "there appears to be a peak in disk fraction as a function of stellar type ( a surrogate for stellar mass ) in some clusters ( lada et al .",
    "2006 ; luhman et al .",
    "2008 ; strom , private communication ) , as well as an increased incidence of debris disks with increasing stellar mass ( trilling et al .",
    "2007 , hillenbrand et al .",
    "2008 , cieza et al .",
    "carpenter et al .",

    "2006 , megeath et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that disk fractions increase monotonically with central star mass ( k - m spectral type range ) , and are less likely to be found around lower mass stars .",
    "recent studies of associations in orion ( hernandez et al . 2007 ) indicate a peak at a spectral type of m0 , which corresponds to a mass of 0.5m@xmath9 .",
    "damjanov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) conclude that the disk frequency in chameleon i is not a function of stellar mass , for a spectral type range from k3-m8 .",
    "an important caveat is that the observational data report dust detections and do not directly trace the gas component or mass of the disk .",
    "conversion of dust observations to disk masses make assumptions about the dust opacity law which is rather poorly known ( e.g. , andrews & williams 2007 ) and also assume a gas / dust mass ratio .",
    "several studies may help validate or rule out photoevaporation as the principal agent in disk dispersal .",
    "further observations of dust disk fractions in clusters may help resolve the seemingly contradictory results obtained so far .",
    "new studies that probe gas directly will be helpful .",
    "better theoretical models are also warranted .",
    "the inclusion of viscosity in time - dependent disk models ( gorti , dullemond & hollenbach , in preparation ) and perhaps improved determinations of uv fluxes to input into these models may also help reconcile the present differences between observational data and model predictions .",
    "we present results of a study on the effects of optical , fuv , euv and x - ray photons from a star illuminating its own circumstellar disk and their role in dispersing the disk gas .",
    "earlier work on photoevaporation focused on the ionizing euv photons either from a nearby massive star or from the central star in an early energetic phase in stellar evolution . here",
    "we mainly examine the role of fuv and x - ray photons which are produced even by low - mass stars during and after their accretion phase and their effectiveness in driving mass loss from the disk .",
    "we include optical , euv , fuv and x - ray heating from the central star and find that fuv photoevaporation is most efficient in getting rid of bulk of the disk gas , located in the outer regions of the disk .",
    "we find that fuv photoevaporation induces neutral flows in the disk that are most significant at the outer disk regions ( @xmath275au ) , where most of the disk mass resides .",
    "typical mass loss rates for a 1m@xmath9 star are @xmath276 m@xmath277 at @xmath278 au , and fuv photons incident on the disk ( of initial mass @xmath279 ) can therefore deplete most of its mass rapidly , on timescales of the order @xmath7 yrs .",
    "x - rays do not cause significant flows , but can enhance fuv photoevaporation rates by ionizing the gas and increasing the efficacy of fuv grain photoelectric heating of gas .",
    "euv photoevaporation is effective in the inner ( @xmath234au for a 1m@xmath9 star ) regions of the disk ( @xmath280 m@xmath277 ) where the stellar gravitational potential is high , and higher temperatures ( @xmath114 k ) are needed for escaping flows .",
    "euv photoevaporation may also affect disk evolution at later stages by creating gaps in the disk ( at @xmath281 au , 1m@xmath9 case ) .",
    "fuv radiation acting with relatively high x - rays could potentially create gaps at @xmath212 au at some stages of evolution , but this is not very conclusive from the static model results of this paper .",
    "fuv photoevaporation depletes the disk mass early in its evolution , before euv photons are able to penetrate the protostellar winds that accompany accretion .",
    "we suggest that disk dispersal is initiated by fuv photons ( aided by x - rays ) which truncate the disk at the radius where viscous timescales equal photoevaporation timescales ( typically at @xmath282 au ) and remove much of the disk mass",
    ". however , time dependent models that follow the decrease in fuv luminosity as the accretion rate drops in time are needed .",
    "as the disk mass drops , viscous accretion rates decrease to values where euv photoevaporation can create a gap .",
    "this occurs when the euv - induced mass loss rate at @xmath283 is higher than the accretion rate here .",
    "the inner disk then drains viscously and the direct illumination of the inner rim ( at @xmath284au ) by euv , fuv and x - rays then results in photoevaporation of the remaining outer disk gas .",
    "however , it is the fuv photoevaporation of the outer disk mass reservoir that sets the disk lifetime .",
    "we find that fuv photoevaporation rates ( and hence disk lifetimes ) are sensitive to the fuv luminosity of the star .",
    "if the fuv luminosity is mainly generated by accretion activity , the mass loss rates decline with time as accretion diminishes in the disk .",
    "fuv generated by stellar chromospheric activity is not very significant in dispersing the disk , and produces mass loss rates similar to that by stellar optical photons and dust heating of gas at @xmath285 au .",
    "disk photoevaporation timescales ( @xmath216 ) are calculated at @xmath44 myrs after the penetration of the disk wind by fuv and x - rays ( at an age @xmath44myr ) and we estimate that disks may last @xmath286 myrs .",
    "we also find that the disk dust opacity may influence the photoevaporation rates by affecting gas density at the flow origin and the degree of flaring . for a factor of @xmath205",
    "reduction in dust opacity , we find that @xmath216 decreases by a factor of @xmath4",
    ". the surface density distribution of gas in the disk may also affect the photoevaporation rate , as steeper radial distributions decrease the radiation intercepted by the disk and reduce the mass loss rates ; changing our surface density from @xmath287 to @xmath56 increases the disk lifetime by @xmath19 50% .",
    "disk lifetimes do not appear to depend on the mass of the central star for stellar masses between @xmath266 and 3m@xmath9 stars . here",
    ", we derive lifetimes of @xmath7 years .",
    "high mass stars ( @xmath288m@xmath9 ) lose their disks rapidly in @xmath11 years because of their very high photospheric fuv and euv fields .",
    "our derived disk lifetimes of @xmath7 years after the fuv penetration of the protostellar wind for typical solar - mass stars are consistent with observations , although this study does neglect dynamics and only crudely considers viscosity .",
    "in addition , derived disk lifetimes may be longer if the initial disk mass is greater than @xmath279 .",
    "however , our qualitative estimates of the `` mean '' disk lifetime by assuming `` mean '' or average stellar properties at a typical age of 1 myr , compare very well with observationally inferred disk lifetimes , without requiring very high euv photon fluxes ( alexander et al .",
    "2006 ) or special birthplaces near massive ob stars in a cluster environment ( e.g. , hollenbach et al . 2000 , adams et al .",
    "2004 , johnstone et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we offer a concluding important caveat .",
    "the present calculations are simplistic and only qualitatively include the effects of viscosity . as the fuv field ,",
    "accretion rates , and disk properties evolve with time , a proper treatment needs to consider all these effects in a time - dependent model . a future goal will be to incorporate the present fuv , euv and x - ray photoevaporation models into a self - consistent and time - dependent solution that includes viscosity ( gorti , dullemond & hollenbach , in preparation )    we would like to thank richard alexander , cathie clarke , kees dullemond , steve strom and mark wolfire for many helpful discussions during the course of this work .",

    "<S> we calculate the rate of photoevaporation of a circumstellar disk by energetic radiation ( fuv , 6ev @xmath013.6ev ; euv , 13.6ev @xmath00.1kev ; and xrays , @xmath1kev ) from its central star . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the effects of fuv and x - ray photons since euv photoevaporation has been treated previously , and consider central star masses in the range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the euv photoevaporation scenario , which creates a gap at about @xmath3 au and then erodes the outer disk from inside out , we find that fuv photoevaporation predominantly removes less bound gas from the outer disk . </S>",
    "<S> heating by fuv photons can cause significant erosion of the outer disk where most of the mass is typically located . </S>",
    "<S> x - rays indirectly increase the mass loss rates ( by a factor @xmath4 ) by ionizing the gas , thereby reducing the positive charge on grains and pahs and enhancing fuv - induced grain photoelectric heating . </S>",
    "<S> fuv and x - ray photons may create a gap in the disk at @xmath5 au under favourable circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> photoevaporation timescales for m@xmath6 stars are estimated to be @xmath7 years , after the onset of disk irradiation by fuv and x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> disk lifetimes do not vary much for stellar masses in the range @xmath8m@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> more massive stars ( @xmath10 ) lose their disks rapidly ( in @xmath11 years ) due to their high euv and fuv fields . </S>",
    "<S> disk lifetimes are shorter for shallow surface density distributions and when the dust opacity in the disk is reduced by processes such as grain growth or settling . </S>",
    "<S> the latter suggests that the photoevaporation process may accelerate as the dust disk evolves . </S>"
