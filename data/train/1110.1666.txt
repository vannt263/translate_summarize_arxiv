    "the interplay of the disorder and nonlinearity is a topic which has been attracting a great deal of interest for a long time , see reviews review-@xcite . in particular , much work has been done on the analysis of dynamics of solitons in disordered external potentials , chiefly in one - dimensional settings , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
    "these studies find an important application to the description of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in random potentials .",
    "the latter topic was addressed in many theoretical @xcite-@xcite and experimental @xcite-@xcite works .",
    "a ubiquitous theoretical model used in this field is the nonlinear schrdinger equation , nlse ( alias the gross - pitaevskii equation , in terms of bec @xcite ) for the wave function @xmath0 , which includes a regular trapping potential and a term accounting for a disordered potential .",
    "the normalized form of this equation , with scaled time @xmath1 and space coordinate @xmath2 , is@xmath3where @xmath4 and @xmath5 correspond to the self - attractive and self - repulsive nonlinearities , both signs being possible in bec , @xmath6 characterizes the strength of the harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) trapping potential , and @xmath7 is a random potential  representing the spatial disorder . in particular",
    ", this model describes dipole oscillations of the trapped condensate , experimentally studied in recent work @xcite , where strong effective dissipation induced by the disordered potential was discovered . on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) with @xmath1 replaced by the propagation distance coordinate @xmath8 is a model of a nonlinear optical waveguide with a random perturbation of the local refractive index , which is represented by the disordered potential @xcite , hence the results reported below apply to spatial solitons in the nonlinear waveguide as well .",
    "our objective is to systematically investigate fundamental properties of solitons in the framework of the model based on eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) .",
    "these include the formation and motion of soliton trains due to the modulational instability ( mi ) of the broadly distributed condensate , and , as suggested by the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , oscillations of a single soliton which is originally placed at a distance from the minimum of the trapping potential , @xmath9 .",
    "the results for these two types of the dynamical behavior , based on systematic simulations of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) and averaging over many realizations of the random setting , as well as on a qualitative analysis of the observed effects , are reported , respectively , in sections ii and iii , and the paper is concluded by section iv .",
    "the subject of this section is the effect of the spatial disorder on the formation of soliton chains from an initial quasi - uniform state , and the subsequent evolution of the chains .",
    "the numerical simulations were subject to the following specifications .",
    "the spatial domain was taken as @xmath10 , and the trapping strength is @xmath11 , hence the respective ho length is much smaller than the size of the integration domain , which makes it possible to consider multi - soliton trains , and persistent motion of the solitons . the split - step fourier method with a spatial grid composed of @xmath12 points and time",
    "step @xmath13 was employed for the spatial and temporal discretization of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) .",
    "the total integration time is @xmath14 .",
    "a fourth - order optimized implementation of the splitting  was used , as in refs . @xcite .",
    "further , the disorder was represented by a spatially correlated random function , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the strength of the disorder , and the marginal distribution of @xmath17 has an exponential form , its covariance function being @xmath18 , in which @xmath19 is the correlation length .",
    "other type of random functions as in  @xcite can be considered in a similar way .",
    "the initial quasi - uniform distribution of the condensate is taken as the ground - state solution of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) with the _ self - repulsive _ nonlinearity , i.e. , with @xmath20 , in the form of @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the real chemical potential , and function @xmath23 was found as a stationary solution of the associated nonlinear diffusion equation ( the imaginary - time version @xcite of eq . ( nls ) ) : @xmath24the same split - step method was used to solve eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) .",
    "then , the evolution of the mi ( modulational instability ) of this state was simulated in real time , following a sudden switch of the self - repulsion into self - attraction , i.e. , replacement of @xmath20 by @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) , which exactly corresponds to the reversal of the sign of the nonlinearity by means of the feshbach resonance in the well - known bec experiment of @xcite .",
    "the mi splits the initial quasi - uniform state into a chain of solitons , which , generally speaking , is an obvious outcome of the evolution induced by the reversal of the nonlinearity sign . however , a new aspect of this outcome , on which we focus here , is the effect of the disordered environment on the resulting solitary wave chain .",
    "we have collected results which demonstrate the dependence of the characteristics of the emerging soliton chain on three control parameters : strength @xmath16 and correlation length @xmath19 of the random potential , and the total norm of the initial state , @xmath25 .",
    "the characteristics whose variation was monitored are ( i ) the number of solitons ; ( ii ) the largest displacement of solitons , i.e. , the largest distance that peaks of individual solitons can travel in the course of the evolution ; basically the displacement for each soliton is computed as the distance between its leftmost and rightmost positions .",
    "then the largest displacement is simply the largest value among all the solitons .",
    "( iii ) the normalized average kinetic energy per soliton , which is defined as @xmath26where the summation is performed on the full set of solitons in the emerging configuration , @xmath27 is the velocity of the @xmath28-th soliton , and @xmath29 is its effective mass , with the integration performed over a vicinity of the solitary wave s peak where the local amplitude of the field exceeds half of its peak value .",
    "the results presented below were produced by averaging over 100 different random realizations .",
    "note that this leads to a non - integer number as the number of solitons for most cases .",
    "typical examples of the realizations are displayed in figs .",
    "[ f : vz5 ] and [ f : vz20 ] , for small and large correlations lengths , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "individual solitons can be easily identified in the plots .",
    "the results for the number of solitons in emerging pattern and their largest displacement are summarized in figs .",
    "[ f : varynorm ] - [ f : varystrength ] . in each panel , we fix two of the above - mentioned control parameters ( @xmath32 ) and vary the third one . for example , the norm is varied in fig .  [",
    "f : varynorm ] , each curve corresponding to a particular set of values of @xmath16 and @xmath19 .",
    "the following conclusions can be made from figs .",
    "[ f : varynorm ] - f : varystrength .    1 .   according to fig .",
    "[ f : varynorm ] , the number of solitons in the chain increases linearly with the total norm , so that the mean norm per soliton , @xmath33 , is approximately constant .",
    "this is a direct effect of trapping the wave field by the random potential : in free space , the entire condensate tends to coalesce into a single soliton , which corresponds a minimum of the system s hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , the sufficiently strong disorder pins portions of the fragmented condensate , forcing them to self - trap into separated solitons .",
    "a fundamental threshold condition for the self - trapping of an initial state into an nls soliton is known in the form of the condition imposed on the _ area _ of the initial configuration @xcite : @xmath34for fixed parameters of the disorder , i.e. , fixed average width @xmath35 of local potential wells trapping fragments of the condensate , the above - mentioned constancy of the norm - per - soliton , @xmath33 , implies a constant average amplitude , @xmath36 , hence the average area per soliton is constant too , @xmath37 , which is consistent with condition ( [ a ] ) , that also implies an approximately constant area per soliton .",
    "thus , condition ( [ a ] ) may explain the results observed in fig .",
    "[ f : varynorm ] .",
    "2 .   figure  [ f : varynorm ] demonstrates the increase of both the largest distance traveled by the solitons , and their mean kinetic energy , with the increase of the total norm .",
    "this feature may be explained by the fact that an individual soliton , moving through the disordered potential , is strongly braked due to the emission of radiation @xcite .",
    "the effectively dissipative character of the motion of coherent wavepackets in this setting was recently demonstrated in the experiment of @xcite ( see also the following section ) .",
    "however , if the system is filled by the trapped condensate , the moving soliton actually interacts with trapped segments of the condensate , i.e. , with an effective _ pseudopotential _",
    "review4 , which is essentially smoother than the  bare \" random potential .",
    "this effect leads to the suppression of the radiation losses , allowing the solitons to be more mobile .",
    "figure  [ f : varylength ] shows that the soliton number decreases , while the largest displacement increases , as the correlation length of the disorder , @xmath19 , increases .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the conclusions presented in the previous item , as the increase of @xmath19 implies the transition to a less disordered potential .",
    "4 .   figure  [ f : varystrength ] clearly shows that both the soliton number and largest displacement change very rapidly when @xmath16 increases from zero to small finite values , i.e. , the disorder starts to kick in when its strength is quite small .",
    "the observed jump of the soliton number to larger values , and the simultaneous drop of the free - path length are consistent with the above argument which states that a deeper random potential splits the condensate into a large number of solitons , and impedes their free motion .",
    "our next objective is to simulate the oscillatory motion of a single soliton in the combined ho an random potentials , which parallels the recently reported experiment performed in the condensate of @xmath38li @xcite .",
    "while the latter experiment focused on the repulsive interaction case of the ( dissipative in the presence of disorder ) dipolar motion of a full condensate , it is straightforward to envision such dynamics for an attractive interaction condensate , namely a localized solitary wave . for this purpose , simulations of eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) were run with parameters selected as the rescaled version of those dealt with in the experiment , where the total number of atoms was @xmath39 , the scattering length @xmath40 is taken as three times the bohr radius of @xmath38li , the transverse trapping frequency is @xmath41 hz , and the longitudinal one is @xmath42 hz .",
    "the initial conditions were taken as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the initial shift of the soliton from the bottom of the ho potential , and @xmath45 is determined by the total number of atoms . with the above physical values , @xmath46 and @xmath47 were used in the simulations .",
    "the split - step fourier method was employed in this case too , with a sufficiently small spacing in order to properly resolve the size of the soliton . in the course of the simulations , the disorder in eq .",
    "( [ nls ] ) was turned on after one and a quarter of the period of the oscillations of the soliton in the ho potential , i.e. , when the soliton s center was passing the origin , @xmath9 .    for given initial shift @xmath44",
    ", we mainly varied two parameters ( as before ) , the correlation length @xmath19 and disorder strength @xmath16 .",
    "for each fixed value of @xmath19 , we varied @xmath16 to infer whether the soliton would survive after 10 periods of the oscillations .",
    "the goal was to compute the _ survival rate _ of the soliton under the influence of the disorder , using 10 realizations for this purpose . in each realization , the survival of the soliton was registered if its final norm , integrated over the fwhm  range around its center , exceeded @xmath48 of the initial value in the same range .",
    "the survival rate is then defined as the number of realizations featuring the surviving soliton , divided by 10 ( the total number of the realizations ) .",
    "typical examples of the survival and destruction of the oscillating solitons are displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : vd5_180 ] . [",
    "note that @xmath49 in the horizontal axis label denotes the planck constant ] .",
    "the results for @xmath50 and @xmath51 mm are displayed in figs .",
    "[ f : x600rate ] and [ f : x100rate ] .",
    "they correspond to the dimensionless values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in eq.([nls ] ) .",
    "these clearly indicate that the survival rate drops to zero as the disorder strengthens and the correlation length decreases , in agreement with the experimental observations for the repulsive case @xcite .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the increasing rate of the emission of radiation by the soliton oscillating across the random potential .",
    "when the disorder becomes very strong , the soliton starts to survive again , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : x100rate ] for @xmath54 mm .",
    "this is explained by the fact that a very strong random potential consists of local potential wells which quickly trap and immobilize the soliton , preventing its decay into radiation and , in addition , the strong random potential impedes the separation of the radiation waves from the parent soliton .",
    "the restabilization boundary is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : vd_vs_x0 ] .",
    "the approximately linear dependence of the minimum disorder strength , necessary for the restabilization , on @xmath44 can be explained with the help the above argument : the driving force acting on the soliton in the ho potential grows linearly with @xmath44 , while the largest pinning force , induced by the random potential , is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the equilibrium between the two , which determines the restabilization threshold , implies @xmath55 .",
    "the objective of this work was to report results of a systematic numerical analysis of individual soliton and soliton train dynamics in the experimentally relevant setting based on the 1d nlse including the combination of the ho ( harmonic - oscillator ) and random potentials .",
    "this setting may be realized in bec and nonlinear optics .",
    "two basic problems were considered : the generation of soliton trains from the initial quasi - uniform state by the mi ( modulational instability ) , after the sudden switch of the nonlinearity from the self - repulsion into attraction , and the survival or decay of a single soliton oscillating in this combined potential .",
    "dependences of the main characteristics of the soliton train , and of the survival rate of the single oscillating soliton , on the strength and correlation length of the disordered potential , and also dependences of the characteristics of the soliton array on the total norm of the initial state , have been produced by averaging over a large number of random realizations .",
    "salient features of this dependences have been explained in a qualitative form .",
    "a challenging problem is extending the analysis to the 2d setting , which may suggest new possibilities for the experiment .",
    "there , one has to consider the interplay of the above analyzed mechanisms with the potential collapse type events of super - critical atomic blobs and hence the relevant phenomenology will be considerable richer .",
    "the 2d setting is also of interest for the repulsive interaction dynamical case , whereby the formation of dark solitons and trains thereof reported in  @xcite may be substituted by the formation of vortices and vortex streets .",
