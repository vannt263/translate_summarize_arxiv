    "if the dark matter that exists in the milky way is a supersymmetric weakly interacting particle ( wimp ) , there are several ways in which it might be detected .",
    "annihilation of two wimps in the halo might give rise to signals of gamma rays , anti - protons or positrons .",
    "dark matter particles caught by the gravitational fields of the sun or earth would be expected to sink to the center , and there annihilate leading to neutrinos that might be detected on the surface of the earth .",
    "finally direct detection of incident wimps from their scattering by nuclear targets on the earth is possible . of these",
    ", the last possibility appears most promising , and there are now a large number of detectors searching for supersymmetric wimps .",
    "we consider here what signals might be available within the framework of supergravity(sugra ) models with grand unification of the gauge coupling constants at the gut scale @xmath18gev .",
    "there are three different types of sugra models currently being investigated , which differ by the mechanisms used to achieve supersymmetry(susy ) breaking in the physical sector .",
    "these are gravity mediated sugra models , gauge mediated models , and anomaly mediated models . of these ,",
    "the gravity mediated models with r - parity invariance have the most robust candidate for particle dark matter , and we will restrict our discussion here to such models . in gravity mediated models , the dark matter particle is the lightest supersymmetric particle , the lsp , ( absolutely stable due to the r - parity invariance ) , and this is generally the lightest neutralino , @xmath0 .",
    "the nucleus-@xmath0 scattering cross section contains a spin independent part and a spin dependent part . for heavy nuclear targets , the spin independent scattering dominates , and",
    "it is possible to extract from data the @xmath0-proton cross section , @xmath19 .",
    "there are a number of astronomical uncertainties , but making conventional assumptions , current detectors ( dama , cdms , ukcdm ) are sensitive to halo @xmath0 if @xmath20 and future detectors ( genius , cryoarray ) plan to achieve sensitivities of @xmath21    we discuss here how these sensitivities might relate to supergravity models .",
    "in particular , we consider the minimal supergravity gut model ( msugra)[1 ] which has universal soft breaking masses at @xmath22 , and nonuniversal soft breaking models[2 ] which allow nonuniversal higgs masses and nonuniversal third generation squark and slepton masses at @xmath22 ( but keep the gaugino masses universal at @xmath22 ) .",
    "while the models are physically different , they lead to qualitatively similar results : current detectors are sensitive to a significant part of the susy parameter space , and future detectors should be able to cover all of the parameter space , except for special regions where there is an accidental cancelation of terms making @xmath23 anomalously small .",
    "each of the above models contains a number of arbitrary new parameters . in spite of this",
    "they can still make relevant predictions for two main reasons : ( i ) using the renormalization group equations ( rge ) starting from @xmath22 , they allow for radiative breaking of @xmath24 at the electroweak scale ( and thus furnish a natural explanation for the higgs mechanism ) ; ( ii ) along with being able to calculate @xmath23 , the models can also calculate the relic density of neutralinos , i.e. @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the relic mass density of the @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the hubble constant , and @xmath31 is the newton constant . both of the above lead to important constraints on the susy parameter space .",
    "thus one has that @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the annihilation cross section in the early universe , v is the relative neutralino velocity at annihilation , and @xmath34 means thermal average .",
    "the dominant feynman diagrams for @xmath33 and spin independent @xmath23 are shown in fig.[fig1 ] , and roughly speaking @xmath33 depends on the crossed diagrams relative to @xmath23 .",
    "thus usually , then , when @xmath23 is large , @xmath33 will also be large , and hence by eq(3 ) , @xmath35 will be small .",
    "thus lower bounds on @xmath35 will produce upper bounds on @xmath23 . in the following",
    ", we will assume @xmath36 and for matter(m ) and baryonic matter(b ) the values @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "( this corresponds to a dark energy amount of @xmath39 ) . for the dark matter",
    "then one has @xmath40 , and if one combines errors in quadrature , one finds @xmath41 . since there is undoubtedly a large amount of systematic error in the above estimates , in the following we will assume the approximately 2@xmath42 spread of @xmath43 the lower bound of eq.(4 ) lies somewhat below other estimates .",
    "however , it also allows for the possibility that not all the dark matter in the galaxy are neutralinos ( e.g. some may be machos ) .",
    "in addition to the above , there are accelerator bounds that constrain the susy parameter space . in the following we use the lep bounds for the light higgs ( @xmath44 ) of @xmath45 gev for tan@xmath1 = 3 , @xmath46 gev for tan@xmath475 and for the light chargino @xmath48 gev .",
    "( for tan@xmath495 , the higgs mass bounds do not restrict the parameter space significantly . )",
    "the tevatron gives the gluino ( @xmath50 ) mass bound of @xmath51 gev ( for gluino and squarks nearly degenerate ) .",
    "in addition there is the cleo measurment of the @xmath52 decay .",
    "we take here a 2@xmath42 range around the experimental central value of the @xmath53 branching ratio[3 ] : @xmath54 of the above , the most significant constraints come from the higgs mass bounds and the @xmath55 branching ratio .",
    "( diag.eps width 10 cm )",
    "in order to get accurate results , it is necessary to include a number of corrections in the calculations .",
    "we list some of these here : ( 1 ) one needs to run the two loop gauge rge and one loop yukawa rge from @xmath56 gev down to the electroweak scale , iterating to get a consistent susy mass spectrum .",
    "( 2 ) below the susy scale @xmath57 , one runs the qcd rge for contributions dominated by light quarks .",
    "( 3 ) it turns out that results are somewhat sensitive to bounds on the higgs mass @xmath58 , and so one needs to use the one loop , two loop and pole mass corrections to accurately calculate the value of @xmath58 .",
    "( 4 ) l - r mixing in the sfermion mass matrices must be included .",
    "these are important for large tan@xmath1 and in the third generation .",
    "( 5 ) one loop corrections to @xmath59 and @xmath60 are included .",
    "this is needed to get the correct value of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 yukawa coupling constants , and again are important for large @xmath61 .",
    "( 6 ) leading order ( lo)[4 ] and some next to leading order ( nlo)[5 ] corrections to the @xmath55 decay are included .",
    "all of the above are under good theoretical controll except perhaps for the @xmath55 constraint appear to have calculated the most important nlo corrections to the branching ratio for @xmath55 for large tan@xmath1 .",
    "these corrections have not been treated here , but will be included in [ 7 ] ( where the bounds on @xmath58 will also be updated ) .",
    "we do not believe this will effect the predictions of the maximum and minimum cross sections given below , but may modify which regions of parameter space get excluded . ] .",
    "we note that we do not make any assumptions on the nature of the gut group at grand unification .",
    "hence we do not impose @xmath62 ( or @xmath63 ) yukawa unification at @xmath22 , and do not impose proton decay constraints .",
    "such phenomena depend sensitively on unknown post - gut physics , and so the validity of these constraints are unclear . for example ,",
    "string models in which there is wilson line breaking of the gut group to the standard model group at @xmath22 , require gauge coupling constant unification but neither yukawa unifications implied by the gut group nor the sugra proton decay constraints need hold[8 ] .",
    "susy theory allows one to calculate neutralino - quark scattering ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , and one must convert this to neutralino - proton scattering to compare with experiment . to do this",
    "we follow the proceedures of [ 9 ] , which requires three parameters : ( i ) the pion - nucleon sigma term , @xmath64 , ( ii ) @xmath65 , and ( iii ) the quark mass ratio @xmath66 .",
    "we use here the values @xmath67 mev ( based on analyses[10 ] making use of recent @xmath68 scattering data ) , @xmath69 mev [ 11 ] , and @xmath70[12 ] .",
    "if one were to use instead the value @xmath71 mev ( based on older @xmath68 data ) then the value of @xmath72 would be reduced by a factor of about 3 .",
    "the msugra model has universal soft breaking and so depends on a minimum number of new parameters i.e. four parameters and one sign .",
    "these are ( 1 ) @xmath73 , the universal scalar particle mass at @xmath22 .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath74 , the universal gaugino mass at @xmath22 .",
    "( alternately , one may use @xmath75 or @xmath76 since these scale approximately with @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath77 , and m@xmath78 .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath79 , the universal cubic soft breaking mass at @xmath22 . ( 4 ) @xmath80 , where @xmath81 gives mass to the @xmath82-quarks and @xmath83 gives mass to the @xmath84-quarks and charged leptons .",
    "in addition , the sign of the higgs mixing parmeter @xmath85 is undetermined .",
    "( @xmath85 appears in the superpotential @xmath86 as @xmath87 . )",
    "we take for this parameter space the following ranges : @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91    if one increases the @xmath74 bound to @xmath92 1 tev ( corresponding to @xmath76 = 2.5 tev , which is the upper detection limit for gluinos at the lhc ) , the neutralino - proton cross section will drop by a factor of about 2 - 3 at the high end of the parameter space .",
    "we examine first the maximum cross section the model can achieve .",
    "@xmath23 is an increasing function of tan@xmath1 , and a decreasing function of m@xmath93 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus the maximum @xmath23 should occur at large tan@xmath1 and small @xmath94 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig2 ] where the maximum cross section is plotted at a function of @xmath94 for tan@xmath1 = 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , in the range of cross sections acessible to current detectors .",
    "one sees that current detectors with the sensitivity of eq.(1 ) , have begun to sample part of the parameter space for tan@xmath95 25 .",
    "further , from the    ( aads20304050.epsf width 10 cm )    maximum tan@xmath47 50 curve , one sees that only neutralinos with mass @xmath96 90 gev are accessible to such detectors .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] shows @xmath97 as a function of @xmath94 for @xmath98 , when @xmath23 takes on its maximum value of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "one sees that @xmath99 is an increasing function    ( aads30om.epsf width 10 cm )    of @xmath94 as expected from the discussion in sec.1 , i.e. since @xmath23 decreases with @xmath94 , one expects that the early universe annihilation cross will similarly decrease , and hence @xmath99 will increase by eq.(3 ) . since @xmath96 90 gev for current detector sensitivities",
    ", we see that current detectors are accessing only the region where @xmath100 .",
    "it is clear that the future very accurate determinations of @xmath101 by the map and planck satellites will greatly sharpen the predictions of the sugra models .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the light higgs mass for tan@xmath4730 when @xmath23 takes on its maximum value . for @xmath10290gev ( the range accesible by current detectors ) one",
    "has    ( aads30higgs.epsf width 10 cm )    @xmath103120 gev .",
    "such a range of higgs mass would be accessible to run2 at the tevatron , if the run achieves maximum luminosity .",
    "we turn next to consider how small the @xmath23 cross sections can get to see how sensitive future detectors must be to cover the full parameter space .",
    "it is convenient to divide the discussion into the region below coannihilation effects and the region where coannihilation can take place .      in this region",
    "there is no coannihilation , and the smallest cross sections occur at the smallest values of tan@xmath1 .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows the minimium value of the @xmath23 cross section as a function of @xmath94 for tan@xmath1=3 .",
    "one sees that the cross section    ( aadslowlimit.epsf width 10 cm )    decreases with increasing @xmath94 as expected , and in this domain we have @xmath105which would be accessible to planned future experiments ( such as genius ) .",
    "coannihilation in the early universe occurs when a second susy particle becomes nearly degenerate with the neutralino lsp , and hence increase the annihilation cross section .",
    "this effect is significant in msugra due to two  accidents \" : ( 1 ) the @xmath107 is a majorana spinor and so its early universe annihilation cross section @xmath108 is supressed relative to e.g. r - slepton ( @xmath109 ) annihilations : @xmath110    \\(2 ) there is an accidental near degeneracy between @xmath111 and @xmath107 in a small region of parameter space . to see this",
    ", one may look at low tan@xmath1 , where one has the analytic formulae for the selectron and neutralino masses of @xmath112 @xmath113 where @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 is the @xmath116 beta function and @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "numerically , eqs.(13 ) and ( 14 ) give @xmath118    @xmath119    one sees that for small @xmath73 , the @xmath120 can become degenerate with the @xmath121 , and as @xmath74 increases , @xmath73 correspondingly increases to maintain the region of near degeneracy . thus one has a corridor in the @xmath122 plane of increasing @xmath73 and @xmath74 where coannihilation effects can occur , extending the region where eq(4 ) can be satisfied .",
    "the importance of this effect has been stressed in [ 14 ] , where the analysis has been carried out for low and intermediate tan@xmath1 , an example of    ( toby.eps width 10 cm )    which is shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "one sees that the coannihilation effect begins at @xmath123 gev ( i.e. @xmath106gev ) . for large tan@xmath1 ,",
    "the sitiuation is more complicated as l - r mixing in the slepton mass matrices becomes important , particularly for the third generation , and generally the light @xmath124 is the lightest slepton , considerably lighter than the other sleptons .",
    "we consider first the case where @xmath125 .",
    "( we use the isajet sign convention for @xmath85 ) .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] shows the allowed region in the @xmath122 plane where eq.(4 ) is satisfied for tan@xmath47 40 .",
    "one sees that there is a significant @xmath79    ( aadcoan40.epsf width 10 cm )    dependence , with larger @xmath79 allowing for larger @xmath73 . in general the thickness of the corridor",
    "is @xmath126 gev .",
    "there is no longer any non coannihilation region left , as the corridors terminate at @xmath74 above the non coannihilation domain ( for large tan@xmath1 ) .",
    "( the termination is due to the @xmath58 and @xmath127 constraints . )",
    "the minimum value of @xmath74 decreases with increasing @xmath79 , as does the thickness of the allowed corridor .",
    "thus for very large @xmath79 , the existence of these corridors eventually becomes a fine tuning .",
    "since larger values of @xmath79 allow for larger values of @xmath73 , one expects the @xmath23 cross section to decrease with @xmath79 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig8 ] where @xmath23 is given as a function of @xmath74 for @xmath128 for two values of @xmath79 .",
    "thus one expects    ( aadcoan40a.epsf width 10 cm )    the minimum detection cross section to occur at largest @xmath79 and smallest tan@xmath1 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig9 ] . where the cross section is plotted for @xmath129 , @xmath1300 , tan@xmath131 and tan@xmath132 . because the higher tan@xmath1 allows @xmath73 to become    ( aadcoan403.epsf width 10 cm )    larger ( compare with fig.[fig6 ] ) which also reduces the cross section ,",
    "the tan@xmath1 dependence is mostly neutralized for large @xmath74 .",
    "one has , however , the lower bound on the cross section of @xmath133 which should still be accesible to the proposed future detectors .",
    "we next turn to the case of @xmath12 . as pointed out in [ 15 ] , at low and intermediate tan@xmath1 , an accidental cancellation can occur in part of the parameter space in the coannihilation region which can greatly reduce @xmath23 .",
    "we investigate here whether this cancellation continues to occur in the high tan@xmath1 region .",
    "what occurs is seen in fig.[fig10 ] where @xmath23 is shown for tan@xmath4720 , 5 and 10 ( in descending order ) .",
    "one sees that    ( aadcoan51020.epsf width 10 cm )    the cross section decreases between tan@xmath1 = 5 and tan@xmath1 = 10 , but then rises again at higher tan@xmath1 .",
    "thus one has that @xmath134 and the minimum cross section occurs at tan@xmath135 : @xmath136    thus in this region of parameter space the proposed future detectors would not be able to detect msugra @xmath107 wimps .",
    "however , the absence of detection of halo wimps would then imply that squarks and gluinos should lie above 1 tev , but at masses still acessible to the lhc .",
    "also then , msugra would require that tan@xmath1 would be in the restricted range given in eq(18 ) , and @xmath85 be negative .",
    "this would allow a number of cross checks on the validity of the msugra model .",
    "in most discussions of sugra models with nonuniversal soft breaking terms , the universality of the the soft breaking masses at @xmath22 of the first two generations of squarks and sleptons is maintained to suppress flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "however , one may allow both the higgs masses and the third generation squark and slepton masses to become nonuniversal at @xmath22 .",
    "one can parameterize this situation at @xmath22 as follows : @xmath137 where @xmath138 squarks , @xmath139 sleptons , etc .",
    "and @xmath73 is the universal mass for the first two generations of squarks and sleptons .",
    "the @xmath140 are the deviations from universality ( and if one were to impose su(5 ) or so(10 ) symmetry one would have @xmath141=@xmath142= @xmath143 , and @xmath144=@xmath145 . ) in the following we limit the @xmath140 to obey : @xmath146 and maintain gauge coupling constant unification and gaugino mass unification at @xmath22 .",
    "while there are a large numbers of new parameters , one can get an understanding of what effect they produce from the following .",
    "the neutralino @xmath107 is a mixture of gaugino ( mostly bino ) and higgsino parts : @xmath147 the dominant spin independent @xmath23 cross section is proportional to the interference between the gaugino and higgino amplitudes , and this interference is largely governed by the size of @xmath148 . as @xmath148 decreases , the interference increases , and hence @xmath23 increases .",
    "radiative breaking of @xmath24 determines the value of @xmath148 at the electroweak scale . to see the general nature of the effects of nonuniverality",
    ", we consider low and intermediate tan@xmath1 where an analytic form exists for @xmath148 ( see e.g. arnowitt and nath , ref[2 ] ) : @xmath149m_0 ^ 2\\\\\\nonumber&+ & { \\rm { universal \\ , parts + loop \\ , corrections}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( note that the higgs and squark nonuniversalties enter coherrently , roughly in the combination @xmath152 . )",
    "we see from eq.(22 ) that @xmath148 is reduced , and hence @xmath23 incresed for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath148 is increased for @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "thus one can get significantly larger cross sections in the nonuniversal models with the first choice of signs for the @xmath140 , and one can reduce the cross sections ( though not by such a large amount ) with the second choice . the above analytic results are illustrated in fig.[fig11 ] , where the maximum @xmath23 for the universal and nonuniversal models are plotted for tan@xmath157 .",
    "one sees that    ( aads7uni7nonuni.epsf width 10 cm )    one can increase the cross section by a factor of 10 to 100 by an appropriate choice of signs .",
    "thus current detectors can probe regions of lower tan@xmath1 for nonuniversal models than for the universal one .",
    "the allowed range can be seen from fig.[fig12 ] , where the maximum cross sections are plotted for tan@xmath158 5,7,and 15 .",
    "( aads5715nonuni.epsf width 10 cm )    current detectors with sensitivity of eq.(1 ) thus can probe parts of the parameter space with tan@xmath159 , and from the tan@xmath47 15 curve , we see that parts of the high tan@xmath1 part of the parameter space has already been eliminated . however , the very low tan@xmath1 values are on the edge of being eliminated by the lep constraint on the light higgs mass .",
    "thus fig.[fig13 ] shows that @xmath58 is quite small if    ( aads7higgs1.epsf width 10 cm )    @xmath94 is light , and one would have to raise the lower bound on tan@xmath1 as lep raises the lower bound on @xmath58 .    as in msugra",
    ", the minimum cross sections occur for the largest @xmath74 and smallest tan@xmath1 , and so they occur in the coannihilation region .",
    "we consider here only the case where the higgs masses are nonuniversal i.e. @xmath160 ( the other @xmath140 set to zero ) .",
    "results then are similar to the msugra case .",
    "for @xmath161 we find @xmath162 for @xmath1630 one again can get a cancelation reducing the cross section to a minimum near tan@xmath47 10 : @xmath164",
    "we have examined here the predictions of several sugra models which possess gauge coupling constant unification at @xmath18 gev , to see what parts of the susy parameter space are accessible to current detectors obeying eq.(1 ) , and what will be accessible to future detectors with the sensitivity of eq.(2 ) . for the minimal sugra model with universal soft breaking parameters , msugra , current detectors are scanning parts of the parameter space where tan@xmath165 , @xmath166 gev and @xmath167 .",
    "in addition , the light higgs obeys @xmath168 gev , and hence possibly would be accessible to run2 at the tevatron . for nonuniversal models , where one allows the higgs and third generation squark and slepton softbreaking masses to be nonuniversal ,",
    "the neutralino - proton cross section can be significantly increased , by a factor of 10 - 100 , with an appropriate choice of sign in the soft breaking deviations from universality .",
    "thus current detectors here could scan regions of parameter space as low as tan@xmath169 , though in these regions @xmath58 is very light , and the the minimum allowed tan@xmath1 may have to be raised as lep raises the the bound on the higgs mass",
    ". however , the possibility of large cross section here has already allowed current detectors to exclude parts of the high tan@xmath1 region , e.g. when tan@xmath415 .",
    "how low sugra cross sections can lie is complicated by the existance of coannihilation effects where the r - sleptons ( particularly the @xmath124 ) can become nearly degenerate with the neutralino .",
    "this allows the relic density constraint eq.(4 ) to be satisfied in a narrow rising corridor ( about 25 gev wide in @xmath73 ) in the @xmath122 plane rising to relatively large @xmath73 , and thus reducing the size of the @xmath170 cross section . for large tan@xmath1 ,",
    "the effect is sensitive to the value of @xmath79 , the range of @xmath73 increasing with @xmath79 .",
    "thus for @xmath1710 , one finds for @xmath92600 gev , the minimum cross section at e.g. tan@xmath131 , @xmath172 is almost the same as that at tan@xmath132 , the increase of the cross section due to the increase in tan@xmath1 being offset by the decrease due to the allowed large value of @xmath73 .",
    "one finds however , that for @xmath161 , at m@xmath93 = 600 gev ( @xmath173 tev ) , the minimum cross sections would still be accessible to detectors with the sensitivity of eq.(2 ) .",
    "the minimum cross sections for @xmath174 is complicated by the possibility of accidental cancelations in the scattering amplitudes , allowing the cross section to sink below 10@xmath175 pb in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "thus one finds for msugra that @xmath176 pb for @xmath177 gev ( @xmath178 tev ) when @xmath179 20 , with a minmum cross section of @xmath180 pb reached at @xmath18110 .",
    "similar results hold for the nonuniversal models . in this",
    "domain sugra models imply that halo dark matter would not be accessible to detectors with sensitivities of eq.(2 ) , and that the gluino and squarks would be quite heavy",
    ". they would still however be observable at the lhc which can detect gluinos with mass @xmath182 2.5 tev [ 16 ] .",
