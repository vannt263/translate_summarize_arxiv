    "until now , lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) rest - frame uv spectra have been primarily used to measure redshifts .",
    "the measured redshifts confirm the high - redshift nature of galaxy candidates selected by their distinctive broadband optical colors ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) ; enable the study of the spatial clustering of these galaxies ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ) ; and , when combined with the apparent magnitudes and colors of lbgs , can be used to construct the rest - frame uv luminosity function and uv luminosity density at @xmath0 ( steidel et al .",
    "one notable exception is the galaxy ms1512-cb58 , a lbg at @xmath2 , discovered serendipitously by yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) during the cnoc cluster redshift survey .",
    "cb58 has an apparent @xmath3 magnitude of 20.6 , due to lensing by a foreground cluster at @xmath4 , which boosts its apparent luminosity by about a factor of @xmath5 ( seitz et al .",
    "1998 ) . due to the incredibly bright nature of cb58",
    ", a wealth of information has been extracted from medium - resolution ( @xmath6 ) studies of its rest - frame uv spectrum ( pettini et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "the velocity profiles of low and high - ionization interstellar metal absorption features have been characterized in detail ; the weakest interstellar metal transitions have been used together with the damped lyman-@xmath7 absorption profile to determine the abundance pattern in cb58 ( an @xmath7/fe enhancement indicative of a young stellar population , and an abundance of @xmath8 for the @xmath7 elements ) ; civ and siv p - cygni stellar wind profiles have been used as independent probes of the stellar population and metallicity of cb58 ; weak stellar absorption features have been used to precisely measure the systemic velocity of the stars in cb58 , relative to which the redshifts of lyman @xmath7 emission and interstellar absorption indicate offsets of several hundred km s@xmath9 ; finally , the strengths of the strongest interstellar absorption features ( which have zero transmission at line center ) have been used to infer a high covering fraction of absorbing material , through which negligible lyman continuum emission can escape ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ) .      in stark contrast to the spectra of cb58 , the @xmath10 resolution spectra obtained for unlensed lbgs ( @xmath11 ) after 1.5 hours of integration with the keck telescopes low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) typically have signal - to - noise ratios of only a few , and therefore do not allow for the same type of detailed study on an individual basis .",
    "the only features visible in even the best spectra are lyman @xmath7 ( in emission , absorption , or both ) , and the strongest interstellar absorption features , whose saturated equivalent widths are indicative of some combination of velocity widths and covering factor , but not abundance measures .",
    "while individual lbg spectra provide limited information , our group has assembled a database of almost 1000 spectra of @xmath12 galaxies over the past five years .",
    "subsamples of galaxies can be drawn from the database with specific criteria , and used to construct higher s / n composite spectra .",
    "for example , a composite spectrum constructed from 29 lbgs at @xmath13 indicates significant positive flux bluewards of the lyman cutoff at @xmath14 ( steidel , pettini , & adelberger 2001 ) . if this composite spectrum is taken to be representative of lbgs at @xmath0 , then the lbg contribution to the ionizing background at @xmath15 could exceed that of qsos at similar redshifts by as much as a factor of 5 . it should be noted that this composite spectrum inhabits an extreme of lbg uv spectral parameter space , with strong lyman @xmath7 emission , a blue uv continuum slope , and interstellar absorption lines whose equivalent widths are roughly half the strength of those seen in cb58 .",
    "also , separate composite spectra constructed for 16 `` young '' ( @xmath16 35 myr ) and 16 `` old '' ( @xmath17 1 gyr ) lbgs , ( whose stellar population parameters were determined from optical / ir photometry ) exhibited systematic differences . the `` old '' spectrum had much stronger lyman @xmath7 emission , while the `` young '' spectrum had stronger interstellar absorption lines ( indicating larger velocity widths or covering fraction of gas ) , and more pronounced p - cygni high - ionization stellar wind features ( shapley et al . 2001 ) .",
    "building on the above pilot studies which included composite lbg rest - frame uv spectra , we are now undertaking a systematic analysis of our entire database of spectra .",
    "these spectra primarily probe outflowing material which is being propelled by the mechanical energy input from active star - formation .",
    "in order to study the physical parameters of these outflows , we will determine how line strengths and kinematics vary in composite spectra constructed along sequences of properties such as uv - luminosity and color , bolometric luminosity , morphology ( from hst ) , redshift , and lyman @xmath7 profile .",
    "as a first step , we have divided our sample according to a crude classification of lyman @xmath7 profile , and see intriguing variations in the resulting composite spectra .",
    "based on the result of steidel et al .",
    "2000 that the distribution of lbg rest - frame lyman @xmath7 equivalent widths has a median of @xmath18 and ranges from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , we divide galaxies into lyman @xmath7 `` emission '' , `` emission / absorption '' , and `` absorption '' subsamples .",
    "figure 1 shows the resulting composite spectra , each of which contains more than 200 galaxies , and has a s / n per pixel of @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the uv continuum shape becomes systematically redder with increasing lyman @xmath7 absorption strength , indicating that both the uv continuum and lyman @xmath7 photons are affected by dust extinction , and providing information about the dust - gas geometry in lbgs .",
    "we also find that the equivalent widths of low - ionization interstellar features of siii , oi , cii , feii , and alii , associated with the neutral ism , increase with larger lyman @xmath7 absorption strength .",
    "as stated above , these equivalent widths are not indicative of abundances , but rather velocity widths , and possibly ism covering factor .",
    "therefore , the larger equivalent widths associated with the `` absorption '' spectrum indicate a larger velocity field , or possibly an ism which is more opaque to ionizing radiation .",
    "we note that the spectrum of cb58 most closely resembles that of the composite `` absorption '' spectrum , whereas the composite spectrum used to measure the lbg lyman continuum leakage has lyman @xmath7 emission and metal absorption strengths which are similar to that of the `` emission '' composite spectrum .",
    "finally , kinematic properties of lbg outflows seem to depend on the lyman @xmath7 profile .",
    "the mean rest - frame velocity offset between lyman @xmath7 emission and interstellar absorption lines is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , however , the velocity offset decreases with increasing lyman @xmath7 emission strength .",
    "we have yet to determine whether this trend is dominated by ism geometry , or evolutionary effects .",
    "rapid star - formation has a profound effect on the ism of lbgs , as seen in the large absorption equivalent widths and significant velocity offsets between rest - frame uv emission and absorption features .",
    "the effects of star - formation also extend to the surrounding inter - galactic medium , through the leakage of lyman continuum emission , and from shock heating by outflowing material .",
    "a systematic analysis of the rest - frame uv spectroscopic of lbgs will help us understand how star - formation transforms both galaxies and their surrounding environment at @xmath0 ."
