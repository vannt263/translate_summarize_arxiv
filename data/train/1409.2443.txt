    "one of the simplest idealized constraints one considers in nonholonomic mechanics is the _ skate _ or _ no - slip _ condition : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are cartesian coordinates in the plane and @xmath4 is the steering direction of the car ",
    "point along its axle",
    ". stated plainly , the no - slip condition states that the wheels of the car are only allowed to roll along the road and , hence , no slipping occurs in the direction normal to the linear velocity of the car .",
    "another closely related constraint is that which an airport luggage cart is subject to ( figure [ fig : cartrailer ] ) . in differential geometry",
    "such differential constraint is an example of a nonholonomic constraint , and it is well known that it does not possess integrable surfaces , i.e. , it fails to satisfy the frobenius condition of integrability ( @xcite , appendix 3 ) .",
    "we now present to the reader a series of mathematical miracles related to the contact distribution above , and her close relatives the so - called _",
    "goursat distributions_.    to begin , consider the projectivization of @xmath5 which we will denote by @xmath6 .",
    "we denote @xmath7 by @xmath8 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to show that @xmath6 is diffeomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "the projectivization lifts various objects canonically defined in @xmath7 , including the tautological 2-plane field , morphisms and curves . in figure",
    "[ fig : prolongation ] we schematize the way various objects are lifted from @xmath8 to @xmath10 .",
    "we can coordinatize @xmath6 by using projective coordinates on @xmath7 : @xmath11)$ ] where the third entry represents the projective coordinates of a vector in @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the canonical projection of the bundle just defined .",
    "fix @xmath13 and consider a line @xmath14 .",
    "then the plane field    @xmath15 ) \\doteq d\\pi^{-1}(l).\\ ] ]    the line @xmath16 has implicit representation in the plane given by @xmath17 . in local coordinates @xmath18 \\cong \\tan(\\theta)$ ] and the inverse image in @xmath6 of this line under the tangent map @xmath19 is the plane spanned by the vectors @xmath20 .",
    "we have thus obtained the contact plane field ( a.k.a skate constraint ) from a geometric procedure known as * cartan prolongation*. this _ operation _ can be iterated , and at each step we projectivize the plane field obtained in the previous step and the output is a tower of fiber bundles known as the semple tower ( @xcite ) :    @xmath21    the semple tower has been rediscovered as the monster tower ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "one can assign to each point a word in the letters r , v , and t , known as an _ rvt code _ , which is an invariant for the diffeomorphism group action .",
    "each consecutive level @xmath10 is endowed with a plane field @xmath22 which is a goursat flag and a geometric model for the configuration space of a airport luggage convoy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these distributions had already been named within the literature of differential geometry ; see @xcite .",
    "one can generalize this construction to obtain a similar tower starting with a @xmath23-dimensional base manifold , but at each step one obtains a tower of fiber bundles with fibers isomorphic to @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 if orientation needs to be taken in into account ) .",
    "each level of this tower will be also denoted by @xmath10 without explicit mention to the base manifold . a word of caution here :    @xmath26    where @xmath23 is the dimension of the base manifold .",
    "correspondingly , each @xmath27 is equipped with a @xmath23-dimensional plane field .",
    "this tower can be thought of as the configuration space of a mechanical articulated arm @xcite .",
    "there is also a mechanical resemblance between the articulated arm system just mentioned and the robotic snake model of hausmann and rodriguez @xcite , though we have to fix the position of the snake s tail .",
    "a simple geometric computation points out that for when the snake is completely stretched out the rank drops and it is not clear what the generic local behavior of this nonholonomic constraint is .",
    "is this a goursat distribution ? or a product constraint ? by _ product constraint _",
    ", we mean a plane field which contains factors as a product of a nonholonomic factor and trivial flat factor : @xmath28 . see section 5.3 of ( @xcite ) .",
    "hausmann and rodriguez determined the reachable sets for certain generic configurations of the snake , but have not discussed in detail the nature of the nonholonomic distributions ( @xcite ) .",

    "a first mathematical miracle in the study of goursat flags or multi - flags is their connection with the singularity theory of smooth of analytic maps @xcite .",
    "the fundamental notion underlying this connection is the _ cartan prolongation _ already alluded to in the introduction . from the point of view of normal form theory",
    ", there is an action of the pseudogroup of local diffeomorphisms at the base @xmath8 .",
    "different orbits will correspond to different normal forms . given a point @xmath29 one associates to it @xmath30 which is the set of all smooth curves through @xmath31 that admit a nontrivial projection back to the base @xmath8 .",
    "it can be argued that @xmath32 ( @xmath33 means equivalent under the group action ) implies @xmath34 . by symmetry , we fix the base point to be the origin and one can act on the fiber @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the canonical projection @xmath37 . on this set of curves we act with the diffeomorphism group and using standard techniques of singularity theory of curves , different curve orbits ( normal forms ) will give rise to different normal forms of plane fields . the first successful step taken in this direction was documented in @xcite .",
    "the task of labeling the orbits is sequential and it works by stages . in @xcite",
    "we described in detail the general tools for this task for the semple tower with base @xmath38 , though the construction and tools work for general base manifolds .",
    "there are two main approaches for determining the orbits :    1 .   the curve approach , and 2 .",
    "the isotropy method .",
    "both methods are rather elementary and perform well in lower dimensions , depending mostly on the combinatorial or projective geometry of the problem at hand .",
    "limitations to both methods are mostly computational in nature , since the amount of bookkeeping grows exponentially as one goes up the tower .",
    "either approach is suitable to computer algebraic systems as pointed out in ( @xcite ) .",
    "many features from classic algebraic geometry are easily transported to the semple tower if one thinks in terms of nash blow - ups instead of quadratic transformations . for a modern reference on the subject see @xcite .",
    "cartan prolongations coincide with nash blow - ups in the analytic category as explained in @xcite and permitted us to make a case for the analogies between the problems in normal form theory for goursat flags and some corresponding problems in enumerative geometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "a technical but rather important result in the classification problem of goursat multi - flags consists of the following :    any well parametrized curve germ @xmath39 that is singular ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) becomes regular ( i.e. smooth and touching only regular points ) after a finite number of cartan prolongations .",
    "this theorem is crucial in defining the rvt code of a point in @xmath10 in terms of cartan prolongations of curves in the base @xmath8 .",

    "the proof consists of first showing that the set of points @xmath46 contains only a finite number of critical points , and once we surpass the last critical point the curve become necessarily smooth .",
    "otherwise it would have to be ill - parametrized .",
    "this is equivalent to the desingularization theorem stated in @xcite but now formulated and proved using the language and tools of nonholonomic geometry .    as a corollary of the regularization theorem",
    "we obtain a nonholonomic version of the classical enriques theorem about multiplicities of consecutive prolongations of a well - parametrized curve , though originally it was worded in terms of quadratic transformations and proximity relations . by _",
    "multiplicity _ of a singularity we mean the first non - zero jet ( if we mod out constants due to a specific choice of chart ) .",
    "this definition is suitable to parametrized curves and is independent of the coordinate chart by di bruno s formula .",
    "we will exchangeably use the term multiplicity for either points or curves . using special charts known as extended kumpera - ruiz coordinates ( see @xcite ) , the nested structure of semple towers ( submanifolds of the original base manifold generate subtowers ) , and the regularization theorem above , we can prove the following :    let @xmath47 .",
    "if a point @xmath48 satisfies    * @xmath48 is in the fiber above @xmath31 , _ or _",
    "* @xmath48 can be be reached by a prolongation of a vertical curve curve through @xmath31 ,    then we say that @xmath31 and @xmath48 are _ adjacent points .",
    "points which are connected this way will form a graph ( in fact , a tree ) with seed @xmath31 .",
    "the adjacency condition will be denoted by @xmath49 .",
    "there is a simple relation between multiplies of adjacent points :    one has @xmath50    this a classic result in enumerative geometry attributed to f. enriques , and in our context it restricts the class of singular points that be reached from a given point via cartan prolongation .",
    "the proof is again based purely on the local geometry of the nonholonomic fields in the semple tower .      in @xcite , we gave a formula for the puiseux characteristic of an analytic plane curve germ which represents a goursat distribution germ with prescribed small growth vector .    given a goursat distribution @xmath51 on a manifold @xmath52 , consider the sequence @xmath53+d_{i-1}$ ] , where @xmath54 .",
