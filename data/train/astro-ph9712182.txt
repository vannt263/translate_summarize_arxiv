    "it is notable that such extreme variability properties have been discovered , so far , only in nls1 .    in the harder @xmath9 210  kev energy band ,",
    "recent asca observations have shown that nls1 can have very different behaviour from classical broad - lined seyfert  1s and quasars . a comparative asca study of a large sample of nls1 and broad - line seyfert  1s revealed that the @xmath9  210  kev asca spectral slopes of nls1 are generally steeper than those of broad line objects at a high statistical confidence level ( brandt et  al .",
    "1997 ) . in order to increase the statistics of hard x  ray data for nls1 galaxies",
    "we have undertaken a program of bepposax observations of a sizeable sample of nls1 ( about 12 over 3 years ) .",
    "we have selected , for the first year of observations , among the brightest and most variable nls1 previously observed by rosat and/or asca .",
    "the spectral capabilities of the detectors onboard bepposax and especially the relatively large effective area at high energy ( @xmath10 2 kev ) will allow a better study of the high energy properties of nls1 .",
    "in this paper we present the first simultaneous 0.110 kev spectrum of the narrow - line quasar tonantzintla  s  180 ( hereafter ton  s  180 ) obtained with the bepposax satellite , together with a high - quality optical spectrum obtained at la silla two months before the x  ray observation .",
    "ton s 180 is an optically bright ( v = 14.4 ) galaxy with an optical spectrum typical of nls1 at @xmath11 = 0.062 .",

    "large amplitude euv variability has been also detected with a doubling time of about 12 hours ( hwang & bowyer 1997 ) .",
    "several pspc observations , both from the rosat all - sky survey and the rosat pointed program , have been discussed by fink et al .",
    "the soft x ",
    "ray flux shows variability with an amplitude up to a factor of @xmath17 on time scales ranging from hours to days and years .",
    "the intensity variations are not clearly associated with significant spectral variations .",
    "the @xmath18 0.12.4 kev spectrum is steep , with photon index values ranging between @xmath18 2.7 and 3.2 .",
    "when averaged over all the observations the mean pspc spectrum is well represented by a two component model consisting of a power law with @xmath16 = 3.10 @xmath19 0.05 and a very steep low energy component , dominant below 0.3 kev , which can be represented either as a steeper power law or as blackbody emission at low temperature ( @xmath18 16 @xmath19 3 ev ) .",
    "optical spectra of ton s 180 were obtained at the eso 1.52 m telescope on 1996 october 1 and  2 , using the boller & chivens spectrograph with a 127 mm camera and a loral / lesser thinned ccd with @xmath20 pixels .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath21 , and the projected scale on the detector is 0.82  @xmath22  pixel@xmath15 .",
    "the grating used had 600  grooves  mm@xmath15 .",
    "the spectra were obtained through a 2  @xmath22 wide slit at a resolution of 4.6   .",
    "both nights were photometric .",
    "four integrations of 1800 seconds each were obtained .",
    "standard techniques were used to reduce the spectra , using the noao iraf package . in particular , the spectrophotometric calibration of the spectra was perfected by comparison with short exposures of ton  s  180 obtained during the same nights through an 8  arcsec slit .",
    "this allowed us to correct the narrow - slit spectra for light losses and differential refraction .",
    "the four individual spectra were finally averaged and yielded the final spectrum shown in fig .  1 . because the calibration curves of the two nights and the individual spectra coincide within @xmath35% , we consider the spectrophotometric quality of the final spectrum to be of this order .",
    "the spectrum of ton  s  180 presents characteristics normally associated with nls1 , such as strong fe  ii multiplets and a weak narrow - line spectrum . the only clearly visible forbidden lines are [ o  iii]@xmath23 and @xmath24 , while [ s  ii]@xmath25 and @xmath26 are barely detected ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "there is no detection of other forbidden lines , such as those of [ n  ii ] , [ o  i ] , and [ fe  vii ] , which are usually clearly visible in seyfert spectra .",
    "the broad line spectrum of fe  ii , on the other hand , with the individual lines of multiplets 27 , 28 , 37 , 38 , 42 , 43 , 46 , 48 , 49 , 55 , and 74 is clearly visible ( compare with phillips 1976 ) .",
    "the continuum redwards of @xmath27    is well represented by a power - law function with slope @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath31 was obtained by fitting a power - law to several dips in between the emission lines .",
    "figure 1 includes the fitted continuum .",
    "the strong excess emission at short wavelengths is part of the well - known small blue bump , which is centred at a rest wavelength of @xmath32    and is most likely the result of a blend between the balmer continuum and several fe  ii multiplets .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum allows to detect very broad , low - intensity wings under h@xmath31 , covering the @xmath337150    range .",
    "rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have recently presented evidence for the presence of broad wings in the uv lines of a sample of nls1 ( which however did not include ton s 180 ) : there is therefore a possibility that similar components are present in the optical permitted lines ( note however that rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "searched for broad wings under h@xmath31 in two objects of their sample without detecting them ) .",
    "while we do not exclude this possibility , we are also concerned that the feature , which is very blue - asymmetric , may be caused by the presence of fe  ii multiplets bluewards of h@xmath31 .",
    "some lines of multiplet 74 , in particular , are clearly visible .",
    "in addition a local deviation of the continuum from the chosen power - law may contribute to creating a spurious wing .",
    "more detailed discussion and analysis of this feature are deferred to a future paper .",
    ".fluxes and widths of the main optical emission features [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the absorption column density has been fixed at the galactic value in all the fits .",
    "the x  ray spectral properties of ton  s  180 are remarkable when compared with those of classical seyfert  1s and quasars .",
    "first of all , the best fit centroid energy of the iron line and its large equivalent width suggests emission from optically thick ionized matter ( e.g. an accretion disk ) .",
    "the properties of iron lines from ionized disks have been studied in detail by matt et  al .",
    "( 1993 , 1996 ) and ycki & czerny ( 1994 ) .",
    "the total equivalent width of the line , if the iron is predominantly in the he  like and h  like states , can be much higher ( up to more than seven times ) than when the iron is neutral ( see e.g. fig .  2 of matt et  al .",
    "this is due to the increased fluorescent yield and the decreased photoelectric absorption opacity .",
    "if only the non - scattered component ( which is the only one easily detectable ) is considered , the ew can be as high as 3 times that of neutral iron .",
    "the observed ew , i.e. @xmath18500@xmath19250 ev , is then consistent with the theoretical calculations .",
    "the present spectra do not allow us to investigate the line profile in detail .",
    "therefore , in principle the feature at @xmath18  7  kev could also be the blue horn of a relativistic line from an approximately edge  on accretion disk .",
    "it has been proposed that relativistic effects from an approximately edge  on accretion disk could provide the boosting needed to explain the giant - amplitude variability observed in the nls1 iras  132243809 ( boller et  al .",
    "an edge  on disk near a kerr black hole can also lead to the strong soft x - ray excess often seen in nls1 ( see cunningham 1975 and the discussion in sect .",
    "5.1.7 of boller et  al .",
    "a difficulty with this explanation is the observed line equivalent width , which is an order of magnitude larger than expected from an edge  on disk ( matt et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "a two - component model provides an adequate description of the continuum x  ray spectrum of ton  s  180 , in analogy with several broad lined seyfert  1s and quasars .",
    "however , the slopes of the two components are rather different from those in broad - lined seyfert  1s ( comastri et al . 1992 ; walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "the soft component is much stronger than in  normal \" seyfert  1s , while the 210  kev slope is steeper than the average value observed in seyfert  1 galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) . the increasing evidence for similar behaviour in other nls1 ( brandt et  al .",
    "1997 ) raises the problem of the origin of such a different spectrum and its relation to the optical properties .",
    "the large relative intensity of the soft component , which in ton s 180 is about a factor 78 times greater than the 210 kev one , and the steep 210 kev slope have important consequences for various models .",
    "even if the observation of a strong iron line suggests that reprocessing is occuring at some level , it appears likely that the strong soft component can not be due only to disk reprocessing .",
    "one would require either highly anisotropic emission or a high energy spectrum extending up to several tens of mev without any cut ",
    "off , at variance with recent high energy observations of seyferts ( e.g. gondek et al .",
    "the hint of a possible lag of the hard photons with respect to the soft ones ( see sect .  4 and fig .",
    "2 ) also argues against disk reprocessing as in this case the soft component is expected to lag the hard one .",
    "a soft x  ray component much stronger than expected from a reprocessing origin alone could lead to a strong compton cooling of the hot corona electrons and so to a steep hard tail if a significant fraction of the gravitational energy is dissipated in the disk phase .",
    "this hypothesis is also supported by the similarities between the x - ray spectra of re  j  1034 + 393 ( pounds et  al .",
    "1995 ) and ton s 180 , with those of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) in their high states .",
    "the high states of gbhc are thought to be triggered by increases in the accretion rate resulting in strong thermal emission from a disk accreting at the eddington limit ( e.g. tanaka 1990 ; ebisawa 1991 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that if the black hole is accreting near the eddington limit , then the disk surface is expected to be strongly ionized , which fits nicely with the present detection of an ionized line .",
    "ionized iron line emission has been recently discovered by asca among high luminosity quasars ( nandra et al . 1996,1997 ) , indicating that these sources are radiating at a substantial fraction of the eddington limit .",
    "the present results corroborate the hypothesis of a high l / l@xmath34 ratio in ton  s  180 .",
    "note that this is also in agreement with the proposed explanation of the narrow - line seyfert  1s phenomenon in terms of a high l / l@xmath34 ratio ( bbf96 ; czerny et al .",
    "1996 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) : the optical line width will be inversely proportional to l / l@xmath34 if the broad line region is virialized .    if the soft x  ray component in ton  s  180 is not the high energy tail of a hot disk accreting at the eddington limit , but is produced by comptonization of a lower temperature disk ( e.g. haardt & maraschi 1993 ) , which would be consistent with the good fit obtained with a power law in the 0.12.0  kev range ( table  2 ) , then the origin of the steep 210  kev component would remain unexplained , unless a more complicated two temperature comptonizing corona is assumed .    the optical and x  ray spectral energy density distribution is shown in fig",
    ".  5 . a simple extrapolation of the data suggest that the energy density peaks somewhere in the extreme ultraviolet , with a behaviour similar to that of other quasars ( e.g. zheng et al . 1997 ) .",
    "also the broad band spectral index @xmath35 = 1.53 between 3000    and 2 kev , is close to the average value of 1.56@xmath190.26 of the radio  quiet quasars in the laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) sample .",
    "given the large - amplitude variability of ton  s  180 , the lack of simultaneous multifrequency observations , and the difficulties that accretion disk models have explaining both the optical  uv and the soft x ",
    "ray emission of agns ( e.g. ulrich & molendi 1995 ; siemiginowska et al .",
    "1995 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) , no attempt has been made to fit the observed spectral energy distribution of fig .  5 with a disk model .",
    "the link between x  rays and optical properties needs also further examinations . while ton s 180 , similarly to most of the nls1 , displays strong fe ii emission ( fig",
    ".  1 ) and relatively rapid x  ray variability , the other well studied nls1 re  j  1034 + 393 , with a similar x  ray spectrum and a ionized iron line ( pounds et  al . 1995 ) , does not show significant evidences of x  ray variability and displays weaker fe ii lines . the steep 210 kev slope coupled with the strong optical fe ii emission in ton  s  180",

    "our main results are the following :    \\(1 ) the optical spectrum clearly confirms the nls1 nature of ton  s  180 and reveals strong fe  ii emission .",
    "moreover , the h@xmath31 to h@xmath1 ratio , which is one of the lowest measured among agns , may imply higher densities than usual in the line emitting region .",
    "\\(3 ) the 0.110  kev spectrum requires at least two components : ( 1 ) a steep @xmath8 2.7 strong soft component below 2  kev which contains a large fraction of the overall energy output , and ( 2 ) a weak hard tail with a 210  kev slope @xmath8 2.3 that is significantly steeper than the average value found in `` normal '' seyfert  1s and quasars .",

    "together with the strong soft excess , the steep high energy slope , and the narrow optical lines , these observations suggest that the source is accreting near the eddington limit and that most of the power is dissipated in the cold disk rather than in the hot corona .",
