    "lithium ion batteries ( lib ) featuring transition metal oxide cathodes and organic solvent - based electrolytes are currently the energy storage devices used to power electric vehicles .",
    "the high operational voltages of libs allow them to store significant amount of energy .",
    "however , these voltages can also induce electrochemical side reactions at electrode - electrolyte interfaces.@xcite these lead to irreversible capacity loss , power fade , durability , and safety issues .",
    "understanding and controlling these interfacial reactions are of great interest for improving electric vehicles .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the basic science of one such reaction , and apply first principles computational techniques to study the first steps of ethylene carbonate ( ec ) decomposition on the ( 100 ) surface of spinel li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 used as the cathode material in many lithium ion batteries.@xcite ec ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is an indispensible electrolyte component for batteries that rely on graphitic carbon anodes . at the negative voltages needed to charge up a battery and",
    "intercalate li@xmath4 into graphite , ec - containing electrolyte decomposes to form stable solid - electrolyte interphase ( sei ) films that prevent further electron leakage to the electrolyte.@xcite as such , substantial theoretical work has been devoted to excess electron - induced ec chemical reactions in the vicinity of the anode.@xcite one may argue that its ubiquity and critical role make ec in lib the battery equivalent of the h@xmath1o molecule in biology , geochemistry , and many solid - liquid interfacial science disciplines .",
    "the present work is indeed modeled after theoretical studies on water - on - mineral surfaces.@xcite    oxidative reactions of organic electrolytes on cathode surfaces and formation of surface film from electrolyte decomposition products there@xcite are arguably less well understood than reduction on anode surfaces , especially at the atomic lengthscale .",
    "electrolyte decomposition products such as lif,@xcite acetone,@xcite aldehydes,@xcite carbon dioxide,@xcite organic radicals,@xcite and unidentified polymer , polyether , and carboxylic acid species@xcite have been detected either in gas form or on the surfaces of li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , as well as on li@xmath3coo@xmath1 and noble metal electrodes set at voltages comparable to those of li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the salt used in the electrolyte strongly affects the surface film composition and properties.@xcite for example , lipf@xmath5 yields fluorine compounds that slow down li@xmath4 transport into the cathode.@xcite    the electrode is also degraded by side reactions .",
    "after cycling power , li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , exhibits surface morphology changes and loss of mn and oxygen ions.@xcite it has been widely accepted that mn(iii ) ions on spinel electrode surfaces disproportionate into mn(iv ) and mn(ii),@xcite the latter of which dissolves into the electrolyte .",
    "the presence of acid has been shown to facilitate dissolution and cathode degradation.@xcite in organic solvents , acid has been speculated to come from reactions between pf@xmath6 and trace water,@xcite or from organic solvent decomposition products themselves.@xcite counterions other than pf@xmath6 cause slower mn@xmath1o@xmath2 dissolution.@xcite there is also evidence that the emergence of proton - intercalated surface regions@xcite or other surface phases,@xcite not just the loss of mn active mass from the electrode , is responsible for cathode capacity loss .",
    "dissolved mn ions have been shown to diffuse to the anode , degrading the sei there and weakening anode passivation.@xcite thus anode and cathode degradation are closely related .",
    "despite these key insights from experimental efforts , the free energy changes , activation barriers , specific surface configurations , and reaction pathways associated with mn(ii ) dissolution have not been elucidated in organic electrolytes .    on the computational side ,",
    "studies have focused either on cathode oxide surfaces without solvent molecules,@xcite or on anions@xcite or ec@xmath4/pc@xmath4 ( with an electron removed ) in the absence of the oxide.@xcite in studies of oxide - vacuum interfaces,@xcite it has been shown that under - coordinated mn ions on mn@xmath1o@xmath2 surfaces adopt low oxidation states , and these mn have been argued to be susceptible to dissolution.@xcite however , dissolution likely require that solvent molecules first directly coordinate to surface mn ions,@xcite which restores part of the octahedral coordination environment .",
    "when this happens , it is not obvious that the surface mn(ii ) and mn(iii ) ions do not revert back to mn(iv ) .",
    "explicit inclusion of solvent molecules on electrode surfaces would be extremely useful to investigate conjectures about surface mn charge states.@xcite    the oxidation potentials of ec ( and the similar pc)@xcite and electrolyte anions@xcite such as pf@xmath6 have been computed using dft methods .",
    "these calculations assume a bulk liquid environment described by a dielectric constant @xmath7 , and an intact ec molecule ( no ring opening reactions during oxidation ) .",
    "the predicted oxidation potentials are at least 1.5  v above the maximum voltage of 4.3  v applied in many electrolyte oxidation experiments for undoped spinel li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite in broad agreement with tabulated data obtained using inert electrodes.@xcite recently , intriguing theoretical studies have predicted that pf@xmath6 or clo@xmath8 in the vicinity of pc , with @xmath7 reduced to reflect `` near - electrode '' conditions , lowers the pc oxidation potential and leads to novel low - barrier reaction pathways.@xcite the anions act as proton shuttles and/or provide fluorine atoms to react with pc .",
    "the oxidation steps are accompanied by bond - breaking events , which occur spontaneously during geometry optimization of ( say ) the [ ec / pf@xmath6]@xmath4 pair .",
    "however , the predicted redox potential of this pair ( 4.94  v ) remains higher than 4.3  v even after the local @xmath7 is set to unity.@xcite this suggests that the electrode surface plays a role in catalyzing electrolyte decomposition . despite the assumption of the proximity of the cathode , the electrode itself is not explicitly included in the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the predicted reaction mechanisms successfully reproduces organic products observed in experiments.@xcite    in the present work , the effect of li@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 electrodes on ec oxidative decomposition is explicitly considered at the atomic lengthscale .",
    "the @xmath10 li content is roughly at the halfway point of charging or discharging .",
    "our focus is on the initial reactions that modify and coat the oxide surface , not on the final distribution of gas / organic products",
    ". our calculations do not extend to the high voltage region which seems to be required for co@xmath1 , one of the proposed final products.@xcite given the inevitable mixture of crystal facet / termination in battery cathode materials and the myriad effects of applied voltage , state - of - charge ( lithium content ) , temperature , electrode cracking , sweep rate , presence of conductive carbon black , dissolution of surface films formed by electrolyte decomposition , and interference from salts , contaminants , and even processes at the anode , adopting all experimental conditions to these theoretical calculations is extremely difficult .",
    "instead , we take a basic science starting point and focus on ec breakdown on defect - free li@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 100 ) surfaces . our predictions can potentially be verified with experiments conducted under ideal conditions , but the mechanism predicted and insights obtained may still be relevant to battery conditions and may motivate new experiments and interpretations of battery degradation processes .",
    "our approach resembles the intensive study of h@xmath1o adsorption on rutile ( 011),@xcite anatase ( 101),@xcite anatase ( 001),@xcite and many other surface facets of technologically important titanium oxide over more than a decade . as in the case of water - oxide interfaces , both ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) and liquid - immersed electrode conditions are considered in our interfacial models .",
    "these conditions yield qualitatively similar predictions .",
    "like h@xmath1o on some tio@xmath1 facets , ec is found to chemisorb on li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 100 ) , breaking internal covalent bonds in the process .",
    "this initial decomposition step enables the subsequent oxidation reaction which involves electron and proton transfer to the oxide surface .",
    "this suggests that organic solvent decomposition and mn@xmath1o@xmath2 dissolution may be related .",
    "no assumption of a local @xmath7 is needed in our calculations .",

    "the physisorption of an intact ec on a surface mn(iv ) ion does not change this charge state distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]b ) . upon breaking an ec c - o bond , however , the o  atom on that broken bond becomes strongly bound to a surface mn ion , which loses an electron to the adjacent , formerly mn(iv ) ion on the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]c ) .",
    "the oxidative step transfers two @xmath55 to the oxide slab . as a result ,",
    "both a surface and an interior mn(iv ) turn into mn(iii ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]d ) .    the possibility of an ec adsorbed on a surface mn(iii ) ion is also considered . upon optimizing the kohn - sham wavefunctions and the geometry , the mn(iii ) coordinated to the ec carbonyl oxygen reverts to an mn(iv ) , with the extra electron migrating to another surface mn(iv ) , converting that mn to a mn(iii ) (",
    "not shown ) .",
    "this suggests that the charge states of surface mn ions strongly depend on whether molecules are coordinated to them , at least on this ( 100 ) surface .",
    "we have also considered a larger , li@xmath23mn@xmath24o@xmath25 slab , of the same lateral dimension as the li@xmath5mn@xmath19o@xmath20 model studied in most of this work .",
    "the tetrahedral site occupancies are determined by calculating the energies of all symmetry - distinct li - configurations .",
    "this model features 8  mn(iii ) ions , and in principle all 8  surface mn could have been mn(iii ) .",
    "instead , 2  of  the  8 surface mn remain mn(iv ) , presumably because the surface layers are deficient in li@xmath4 .",
    "interactions between h@xmath1o and li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 surfaces are pertinent to how trace h@xmath1o in the atmosphere or electrolyte affects mn@xmath1o@xmath2 stability .",
    "( water may also emerge from electrolyte decomposition . )",
    "acids are known to degrade spinel oxide electrodes,@xcite and water can be a source of h@xmath4 . in this appendix , we consider the effect of decorating and functionalizing li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( 100 ) surfaces with h@xmath1o , h@xmath4 , and oh@xmath51 groups .",
    "figure  [ fig6]a depicts h@xmath1o physisorption on the ( 100 ) surface at the @xmath10 stochiometry .",
    "it exhibits a binding energy of 0.452  ev , comparable to ec physisorption . breaking a o - h bond in water and displacing the proton to a neighboring surface o  ion to form two new hydroxyl groups lead to a 1.027  ev binding energy after performing geometry optimization ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]b ) .",
    "thus dissociative chemisorption is more favorable than physisorption by 0.575  ev .",
    "however , even this chemisorbed configuration may be metastable compared to one where the h@xmath4 has penetrated into the subsurface layer ( see below ) .",
    "next , we consider the effect of multiple hydroxyl groups on the surface .",
    "we turn to mn@xmath1o@xmath2 , without li@xmath4 intercalation , and decorate all surface o  ions with h atoms and all surface mn ions with oh groups .",
    "the geometry is relaxed to a local energy minimum ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]c ) . the first type of hydroxyl groups , originating from protonation of surface oxygen atoms , point outward or parallel to the oxide surface .",
    "the second type , hydroxyl groups formed by adding oh pendants to mn , always point out of the plane . as there are more added h  than  oh , the charge - neutral slab now contains some mn(iii ) ions .    starting from this optimized geometry ,",
    "a 11  ps aimd trajectory is conducted at t=450  k. the final configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6]d . some type  1 hydroxyl groups now point inwards , with their h@xmath4 occupying sites that li@xmath4 normally reside in li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this is reasonable because the interior sites bracketed by o@xmath73 ions should be electrostatically more favorable for cations and protons . in one instance , a type  1 hydroxyl group has abstracted a h@xmath4 from a neigboring hydroxyl group to form a h@xmath1o .",
    "the oxygen atom of that water molecule coordinates to a surface mn  ion 2.3   away in this snapshot , instead of the initial mn - o ionic bonding distance ( @xmath74   ) . that mn ion now has only 4 ionic bonds in addition to coordination to the h@xmath1o molecule , and should be more susceptable to chemical reactions and dissolution .",
    "these trends are consistent with the experimental observations that protons accelerate decomposition of spinel li@xmath3mn@xmath1o@xmath2.@xcite despite the low temperature compared to experimental annealing conditions during synthesis,@xcite evidence of h@xmath1o loss is already observed .",
    "type  2 hydroxyl groups appear stable over the course of the aimd trajectory . as surface o  atoms dissolves after h@xmath4 attacks , however , even mn  ions attached to type 2 hydroxyls may become undercoordinated , exposed , and susceptable to attack by other h@xmath1o moleules or the organic electrolyte .",
