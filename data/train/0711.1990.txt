    "in a wigner lattice ( wl ) , long - range coulomb repulsion dominates over the kinetic energy of electrons and leads to strong and well - defined charge order .",
    "@xcite originally introduced for the electron gas with a homogeneous neutralizing background , this concept was generalized to electrons on a lattice by hubbard .",
    "@xcite evidence for quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) wigner lattices has been found in organic  @xcite and anorganic  @xcite chain compounds , nanowires  @xcite and in carbon nanotubes.@xcite low - dimensional wls are favored by reduced screening.@xcite moreover , strong correlations induced by large local hubbard interaction @xmath5 suppress screening further and protect the long - range nature of the coulomb repulsion.@xcite it is , however , not straightforward to distinguish a true wl from a quantum - mechanical charge - density wave ( cdw ) simply on the basis of the periodicity of the charge modulation .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the modulation period of the wl coincides with that of the @xmath6 cdw .",
    "@xcite this may be surprising , as the microscopic origin of the charge order in the two cases is fundamentally different:@xcite ( i ) the mechanism for the wl is based solely on the classical coulomb repulsion and is dependent only on the charge of electrons and not on their fermionic nature .",
    "the periodicity follows simply from the configuration of charges with minimal energy .",
    "( ii ) instead , the quantum mechanical cdw depends on the fermi surface topology and the instability and modulation reflects the fermi momentum @xmath7 .",
    "if we allow for nearest  neighbor ( nn ) and next  nearest  neighbor ( nnn ) hoppings @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we arrive at an even more interesting model which , depending on the relative size and sign of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , may have an electron dispersion with two minima instead of one.@xcite actually , it has been proposed that the edge - sharing cuo chain compounds are described by such models with @xmath8 .  @xcite it is then immediately obvious that in the case of a four - fermi - point topology the periodicities of wl and cdw no longer coincide .",
    "we note that the experimentally observed charge modulations in the edge - sharing compounds na@xmath9cuo@xmath10  @xcite are strong and their periodicity consistent only with that of the wl . another possible type of instability in the presence of strong correlations , namely , the 2@xmath7 peierls and spin - peierls modulations , @xcite which requires a distortion of the lattice , appears to be ruled out in these systems .",
    "doped edge - sharing chains are also building blocks of the ca@xmath11y@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14@xcite and the sr@xmath15ca@xmath16cu@xmath17o@xmath18@xcite systems , and pronounced charge order has been observed in these compounds as well .",
    "here we shall investigate the intrinsic mechanisms for the magnetism of generalized wigner lattices .",
    "it is well known that nnn hopping @xmath1 has nontrivial consequences for magnetism in the 1d hubbard model at general filling and may lead to ferromagnetic ( fm ) states in certain cases .",
    "@xcite it should be kept in mind that , according to the lieb - mattis theorem , @xcite ferromagnetism is excluded at any filling in the 1d hubbard model with nn hopping ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) . for the 1d hubbard model with nn and nnn hopping , pieri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and daul and noack @xcite found that ferromagnetic ground states appeared above a critical @xmath5 in those regions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane where four fermi points exist .",
    "these results were obtained in the metallic regime where the relevance of fermi surface topology is suggestive ; however , the implications for the localized electrons of a wigner crystal are unclear .",
    "the magnetism of generalized wls is typically discussed in terms of effective heisenberg models where the position of the spins is dictated by the charge order pattern of the wl .",
    "@xcite the prevailing superexchange interactions are antiferromagnetic . however , there are also ferromagnetic couplings in edge - sharing chains due to the hund interaction at the oxygen ligands that may be larger than the af interactions and render , e.g. , the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath20 ferromagnetic",

    "study of the @xmath21 hubbard - wigner model , which includes local hubbard @xmath5 and long - range coulomb interactions @xmath22 , we show that there is a regime of fully polarized fm states at negative @xmath1 .",
    "subsequently , we derive an effective magnetic hamiltonian for the wigner - lattice regime , i.e. @xmath23 , and show that the emergence of ferromagnetism can be explained by an effective _ kinetic exchange _",
    "mechanism mediated by nnn hopping @xmath1 .",
    "the associated magnetic exchange constant @xmath24 depends on the sign of @xmath1 and therefore kinetic exchange is found to favor ferromagnetism for negative @xmath1 and antiferromagnetism for positive @xmath1 .",
    "kinetic exchange involves excitations across the charge gap @xmath25 of the wl but not across the usually much larger mott - hubbard gap @xmath26 , as is the case for af superexchange or for many realizations of fm three - particle ring exchange .",
    "@xcite the charge gap @xmath25 of the generalized wl depends sensitively on the commensurability with the underlying crystalline lattice . at quarter - filling this gap",
    "is particularly large @xmath27 .",
    "if the charge gap @xmath28 of the wl is much larger than the hopping amplitudes @xmath0 and @xmath1 and any expected magnetic couplings , a separation of charge and magnetic energy scales appears straightforward . hence , charge ordering in a wl",
    "is usually discussed in terms of spinless fermions .",
    "magnetism , e.g. , antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange or ferromagnetic ( fm ) hund s rule  @xcite and three - site ring exchange ,  @xcite is then treated as a perturbation given a particular charge - ordering pattern .",
    "one would , however , not expect the magnetic order to have a strong impact on the underlying charge order , because the magnetic energy scale is so much smaller than the dominant coulomb repulsion for all these processes .",
    "@xcite the motivation for this work was the initial observation that the charge structure of the wl , measured by the charge structure factor @xmath29 at @xmath30 , is strongly affected by electron spin , in disagreement with the calculation for spinless fermions . yet there is a region in the @xmath21 phase diagram at negative @xmath1 where @xmath31 is the same for spinless fermions and for fermions with spin , and , moreover , @xmath31 does not depend on @xmath1 in that parameter range .",
    "the obvious conjecture is that the ground state should be fully spin - polarized in this regime .",
    "we show here that , due to the kinetic exchange mechanism , these fm ground states emerge and that the kinetic exchange processes have a surprisingly strong impact on the charge ordering in spite of the classical origin of the wl .",
    "indeed , the af state at @xmath32 has dramatically weaker charge order than the ferromagnetic or spinless states .",
    "while the charge order is reduced @xmath33 for positive @xmath1 , it does not depend on @xmath1 in the fm regime @xmath34 with negative @xmath1 .",
    "remarkably , for negative @xmath1 values below @xmath35 , af reappears , yet the charge order then increases with increasing modulus @xmath36 .",
    "the boundaries of the fm phase follow from the effective spin hamiltonian as @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and match the magnetic phase boundaries found using the dmrg .",
    "this peculiar behavior is due to a purely quantum effect involving destructive interference of kinetic exchange processes in the fm state due to the pauli principle and constructive interference for the af case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after introducing the hubbard - wigner hamiltonian in sec .  [",
    "sec : model ] , we present results for the charge structure factor for spinless fermions interacting via long - range coulomb interaction in sec .",
    "[ sec : charge ] .",
    "we shall see that the results for spinless fermions coincide with results for electrons with spin in some region of the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram , while they are substantially different in other parts of the phase diagram .",
    "we derive an effective heisenberg hamiltonian in sec .",
    "[ sec : spin ] and show that the magnetic phase diagram , i.e. , the appearance of the fully saturated fm phase and its phase boundaries , can be naturally explained .",
    "next we show that the peculiarities found numerically for the the charge structure factor find a straightforward analytical description in the framework of the effective hamiltonian . finally , we discuss and summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the hubbard - wigner hamiltonian investigated in this paper is motivated by the one - dimensional edge - sharing cuo - chains .",
    "@xcite edge - sharing chains are formed by cuo@xmath39 squares just as in the cuo planes of the high - t@xmath40 compounds , but these units are differently linked .",
    "the edge - sharing arrangement leads to small nearest - neighbor hopping matrix element @xmath0 due to the almost 90@xmath41 cu - o - cu coordination , and some contribution to @xmath0 stems from direct cu @xmath42-@xmath42 overlap .",
    "@xcite moreover , the structure leads to a comparatively large matrix element @xmath1 between second neighbor cu ions stemming from a cu - o - o - cu path .",
    "@xcite thus edge - sharing chains , in contrast to the 180@xmath43 bonded high - t@xmath40 cuprates , fulfill the fundamental criterion for a wl , namely that the kinetic energy is small compared to the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , in an optimal way . while the coulomb repulsion is screened by a static dielectric constant in these insulators , the one over distance decay of the interaction is preserved and must be taken into account .",
    "truncation of the interaction may have serious consequences for the charge - order pattern of generalized wls @xcite as well as for their charge excitations .",
    "@xcite    the relevant states of cu that need to be included in a low - energy model are : cu@xmath44 or , more precisely , the cu @xmath45-ligand hole singlet state , cu@xmath46 with spin-1/2 , and cu@xmath47 , corresponding to the filled @xmath42 shell .",
    "these states can be expressed in the frame of a single - orbital hubbard model with 0,1 or 2 electrons per site .",
    "thus we consider the hubbard - wigner hamiltonian , where the extension wigner indicates that the long - range coulomb interaction is included .",
    "this model has the form @xcite @xmath48 where the operators @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) create ( destroy ) electrons with spin @xmath51 at lattice site @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "the local density is given by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and the average density is @xmath56 for @xmath57 electrons .",
    "the kinetic energy term includes nn hopping @xmath0 and nnn hopping @xmath1 , which are both typically much smaller than either the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath5 or the nn - coulomb interaction @xmath58 that parametrizes the long - range coulomb interaction @xmath59 . in the case of finite rings of length @xmath60 ,",
    "we truncate the @xmath61 behavior at @xmath62 , which is equivalent to replacing @xmath63 by @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we have verified that small modifications to the @xmath61 behavior do not affect our results .",
    "in fact , truly long - range coulomb repulsion is not crucial for the results presented here : at quarter filling , both the fm kinetic exchange and the weakened charge order can also be seen for on - site @xmath5 and nn coulomb repulsion @xmath66 only . in the following ,",
    "we consider the model with long - range coulomb interaction and use the nn coulomb repulsion @xmath67 as unit of energy . without loss of generality",
    ", @xmath0 is chosen to be positive .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) contains two ingredients that have been shown to favor fm correlations in hubbard - like models : strong on - site and longer - range coulomb repulsion  @xcite and , perhaps more importantly , nnn hopping .",
    "@xcite in this paper we address the most transparent instance of the wl , namely quarter filling @xmath68 for hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we explore the magnetic properties within the wl regime , i.e. , @xmath69 , which have not been explored before , and find fm ground states in a region of the @xmath0-@xmath1 phase diagram with negative @xmath1 .",
    "quite unexpectedly , we also find a strong influence of magnetism on wl charge order .",
    "for comparison , we will first discuss the charge ordering for spinless fermions at half filling , corresponding to the fully spin - polarized case with @xmath68 . at small @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ", the alternating charge order is very rigid and its lowest charge excitations are domain walls ( dws ) with fractional charge .",
    "@xcite dws can be induced in a perfectly ordered state via nn hopping @xmath0 , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dws_pm ] .",
    "their creation costs energy @xmath27 in the case of long - range coulomb interaction , and once created they can move easily through the lattice via @xmath0 hopping processes .",
    "their fractional charge @xmath70 is responsible for the distinctive wl features in the optical conductivity and in photoemission .",
    "@xcite    we investigate this model with exact diagonalization ( ed ) for spinless fermions and chains of up to @xmath71 sites .",
    "we use the lanczos algorithm with a numerical accuracy of @xmath72 and check its validity by use of full diagonalization for up to 18 sites .",
    "these ed calculations were done for both the ground state ( @xmath73 ) and for small but finite temperatures ( @xmath74 ) , leading to practically identical results at small @xmath0 and @xmath1 because there is a finite charge gap @xmath75 , which blocks changes at temperatures with an energy scale smaller than this . for electrons with spin",
    ", we use the dmrg with chains of @xmath76 , and find results consistent with the ed for spinless fermions . in the dmrg , we keep 200 to 1200 states at each step , perform up to 10 finite - size sweeps and the neglected weight is @xmath77 . for parameters with a fm ground state , the energy obtained with the dmrg agrees with the ed result .",
    "increasing the nn hopping @xmath0 gradually reduces the charge ordering  @xcite until , at @xmath78 , the charge gap vanishes .",
    "@xcite this is reflected in the charge structure factor @xmath79 which , for perfect charge alternation , is peaked at @xmath80 with @xmath81 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nn_af_fm ] , the results for spinless fermions , obtained using lanczos diagonalization , show that @xmath31 is strongly reduced even before the gap vanishes , giving a weaker charge density wave .",
    "we find that , for spinless fermions , the melting of wl charge order with @xmath0 does _ not _ depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath31 can be described analytically because only few dws are present at small @xmath0 . to leading order ,",

    "the ground state changes fundamentally ; @xmath29 develops a broad continuum with a maximum between @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( moving to @xmath88 at large @xmath1 ) rather than at @xmath87 . just as @xmath1",

    "while the transition between the two cdw phases with @xmath30 and @xmath91 depends on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it is remarkable that the wl is never affected by the _ combination _ of hopping processes .",
    "we would actually expect some cooperative effects between @xmath0 and @xmath1 because nnn hopping is no longer frustrated in the presence of @xmath0 , see fig .",

    "since two electrons swap places in the second case , the resulting fermi sign leads to destructive interference and the lowest - order processes associated both with @xmath0 and with @xmath1 cancel out .",
    "after this discussion of the spinless model , we now turn to electrons with spin . due to the dominance of the coulomb repulsion and the classical nature of wl ordering",
    ", we might not expect charge ordering to be affected significantly by the spin degree of freedom as long as @xmath93 .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath31 obtained using the dmrg for electrons with spin indicates that there is a surprisingly strong influence even for @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast to spinless fermions , where @xmath1 does not affect the behavior of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath0 , we find the charge order to be considerably weakened at @xmath32 for electrons with spin , see fig .  [",

    "@xcite this is perhaps not that surprising , as the charge order in the wl is not caused by a quantum mechanical fermi - surface instability but by the strong coulomb repulsion , which does not depend on the fermi surface .",

    "@xmath1 , charge order does not depend on @xmath1 . at large negative @xmath1 , however , the antiferromagnetic phase reappears , but now , surprisingly , the charge order becomes stiffer as @xmath36 is increased .",
    "this peculiar behavior finds its explanation in the @xmath1 dependence of the domain - wall gap @xmath142 in the af state .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that , in wigner lattices with next - nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath1 , a _ kinetic exchange mechanism _ is at work , which favors ferromagnetism for negative nnn hopping @xmath1 and might explain the spin polarization recently observed in strongly charge - ordered carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the usual superexchange processes , which involve virtual excitations across the mott - hubbard gap @xmath143 , kinetic exchange arises from virtual transitions across the wigner lattice charge gap @xmath144 .",
    "although fermi surface topology describes neither charge nor magnetic order in the strongly correlated wl , we nevertheless find that quantum interference of electrons is important in the wl .",
    "in fact , the spin degrees of freedom have such a strong impact in the af regime that charge ordering _ can not _ be described reliably in terms of spinless fermions , even in the extreme wl regime @xmath145 . as this effect",
    "is intimately related to the _ kinetic exchange mechanism _ , it may also be relevant in higher dimensions , e.g. , the above - mentioned kagome systems .",
