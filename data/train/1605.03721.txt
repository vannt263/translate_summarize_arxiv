    "this paper is concerned with the use of nonlinear cross - diffusion systems for the mathematical modeling of image filtering . in this approach a grey - scale image is represented by a vector field @xmath1 of two real - valued functions @xmath2 defined on some domain in @xmath3 .",
    "additionally , an image restoration problem is modelled by an evolutionary process such that , from an initial distribution of a noisy image and with the time as a scale parameter , the restored image at any time satisfies an initial - boundary - value problem ( ibvp ) of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations ( pde ) of cross - diffusion type , where the coupled evolution of the two components of the image and the nonlinearity are determined by a cross - diffusion coefficient matrix .",
    "the use of cross - diffusion systems for modelling , especially in population dynamics , is well known , see e.  g. galiano et al .",
    "@xcite and ni @xcite ( along with references therein ) . to our knowledge , in the case of image processing , two previous proposals are related .",
    "the first one concerns the use of complex diffusion ( gilboa et al .",
    "@xcite ) , where the image is represented by a complex function and the filtering process is governed by a nonlinear pde of diffusion type with a complex - valued diffusion coefficient .",
    "this equation can be written as a cross - diffusion system for the real and imaginary parts of the image .",
    "the application of complex diffusion to image filtering and edge - enhancing problems brings advantages based on the role of the imaginary part as edge detector in the linear case ( the so - called small theta approximation ) and its use , in the nonlinear case , instead of the size of the gradient of the image as the main variable to control the diffusion coefficient , gilboa et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a second reference on nonlinear cross - diffusion is the unpublished manuscript by lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite , where the authors prove the existence of a global solution of a cross - diffusion problem , related to the complex diffusion approach proposed by gilboa and collaborators .",
    "this already represents an advance with respect to the ill - posed perona - malik formulation , perona & malik @xcite and kinchenassamy @xcite . additionally , a better behaviour of cross - diffusion models with respect to the textures of the image is numerically suggested .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of a companion work by the same authors devoted to the application of linear cross - diffusion processes to image filtering ( arajo et al .",
    "the linear cross - diffusion is analyzed as a scale - space representation and an axiomatic , based on scale invariance , is built .",
    "then those convolution kernels satisfying shift , rotational and scale invariance as well as recursivity ( semigroup property ) are characterized .",
    "the resulting filters are determined by a positive definite matrix , directing the diffusion , and a positive parameter which , as in the scalar case , pauwels et al .",
    "@xcite , delimits the locality property . furthermore ,",
    "since complex diffusion can be seen as a particular case of cross - diffusion , some properties of the former are generalized in the latter .",
    "more precisely , the use of one of the components of the cross - diffusion system as edge detector is investigated , extending the property of small theta approximation .",
    "the general purpose of the present paper is to continue the research on cross - diffusion models for image processing , by incorporating nonlinearity .",
    "the contributions of the paper are the following :    * we formalize nonlinear cross - diffusion ibvp as mathematical models for image processing , by proving the following theoretical results : 1 .",
    "well - posedness . by assuming that the coefficient matrix is uniformly positve definite and has globally lipschitz and bounded entries ,",
    "the ibvp of a nonlinear cross diffusion system of pde with neumann boundary conditions is studied .",
    "the existence of a unique weak solution , continuous dependence on the initial data and the existence of an extremum principle are proved .",
    "some of the arguments of lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite for the system under study will be used and generalized here .",
    "some extensions , not treated here , are the use of nonlocal operators and different types of boundary conditions in the pde formulation .",
    "the previous ibvp is also studied from the scale - space representation viewpoint , see e.  g. lvarez et al .",
    "@xcite and lindeberg @xcite .",
    "specifically , grey - level shift invariance , reverse contrast invariance and translational invariance are proved under additional assumptions on the diffusion coefficients .",
    "3 .   the theoretical results are completed by analyzing the existence of lyapunov functionals associated to the cross - diffusion problem , weickert @xcite .",
    "the first result here is the decreasing of the energy ( defined as the euclidean norm of the solution ) by cross - diffusion .",
    "the existence of lyapunov functionals different from this energy depends on the relation between the cross - diffusion coefficient matrix and the function defining the functional .",
    "finally , the solution is proved to evolve asymptotically to a constant image consisting of the average values of the components of the initial distribution . * a numerical comparison of the performance of the models is made .",
    "the computational study is carried out on the basis of the results about the linear models , presented in arajo et al . @xcite and the numerical treatment of complex diffusion in gilboa et al .",
    "more precisely , the performance of the experiments is based on the choices of the cross - diffusion coefficient matrix and the scheme of approximation to the continuous problem . + as far as the coefficients are concerned , we select a matrix which combines linear cross - diffusion , including a constant positive definite matrix , with the use of standard edge detection functions , depending on the component of the image that plays the role of edge detector from the generalized small theta approximation .",
    "the resulting form of the diffusion matrix generalizes the complex diffusion approach , gilboa et al . @xcite .",
    "two strategies for the treatment of the edge detection functions are also implemented .",
    "+ on the other hand , an adaptation to cross - diffusion systems of an explicit numerical method , considered and analyzed in arajo et al .",
    "@xcite and bernardes et al .",
    "@xcite , for complex diffusion problems was used to perform the numerical experiments in filtering problems .",
    "the numerical results reveal differences in the behaviour of the models , according to the choice of the positive definite matrix and the edge stopping function .",
    "they are mainly concerned with a delay of the blurring effect ( already observed in the linear case ) and the influence of the generalized small theta approximation in the detection of the edges during the filtering problem .",
    "the paper is structured according to these highlights . in section",

    "this is based on evaluating the blur annoyance of the image by comparing the variations between neighbouring pixels before and after the application of a low - pass filter .",
    "the estimation ranges from @xmath96 ( the best quality blur perception ) to @xmath393 ( the worst one ) .",
    "the following numerical results illustrate the behaviour of ( [ cd1])-([cd1b ] ) according to the choice of the matrix @xmath244 in ( [ cd31 ] ) and the implementation of ( [ cd32 ] ) .",

    "these models were taken to study three points of the filtering : the restoration process from the first component of the numerical solution of ( [ cd35 ] ) , the behaviour of the edges from the second component and the quality of filtering from the computation of the evolution of the three metrics .    the numerical experiments in figure [ figrii_2 ] , show the time evolution of the snr and psnr parameters given by the models ncdf1 - 3 .",
    "for the three models , the metrics attain a maximum value from which the quality of restoration is decreasing .",
    "the main difference appears in the time at which the maximum holds , being longer in the case of ncdf1 ( corresponding to @xmath335 ) and ncdf3 ( for which @xmath337 ) then in the model ncdf2 ( where @xmath336 : this would illustrate the complex diffusion case , see arajo et al .",
    "@xcite ) . note also from figure [ figrii_2 ] that ncdf1 and ncdf3 will provide a better evolution of the two metrics : they will be more suitable than ncdf2 for long time restoration processes , while ncdf2 performs better in short computations .    since the longer the evolution the more noise is removed , models ncdf1 and ncdf3 suggest a better control of the diffusion to improve the quality of the restored images .",
    "this is observed in figures [ figrii_3a ] and [ figrii_3b ] , which show the two components of the solution of ( [ cd35 ] ) at time @xmath398 given by ncdf1 and ncdf2 .",
    "( the images corresponding to ncdf3 are similar to those of ncdf1 and will not be shown here . )",
    "observe that the second component has the role of edge detector and it is less affected by noise and over diffusion in the case of ncdf1 .    for large values in magnitude of the entries of the matrix @xmath244 in ( [ cd32 ] )",
    "the differences in the models are more significant .",
    "this is illustrated by a second group of experiments , for which the matrices are    * ncdf4 ( @xmath335 ) : @xmath399 . * ncdf5 ( @xmath336 ) : @xmath400 .",
    "* ncdf6 ( @xmath337 ) : @xmath401 ,    and the rest of the implementation data is the same as that of the previous experiments . the evolution of the snr and psnr values is now shown in figure [ figrii_4 ] . note that the behaviour of ncdf5 and ncdf6 is very similar and their quality metrics , compared to those of ncdf4 , are more suitable up to a time of filtering close to @xmath402 . from this time",
    ", ncdf4 behaves better and becomes a better choice to filter for a longer time .",
    "the comparison between the solutions of ( [ cd35 ] ) with the three models reveals these differences in a significant way , see figures [ figrii_5a]-[figrii_6b ] , where the images corresponding to ncdf4 and ncdf5 at several times are displayed .",
    "( the results with ncdf6 are very similar to those of ncdf5 . ) in the case of the first component ( figures [ figrii_5a ] and [ figrii_5b ] ) , the performance of the models by @xmath398 are similar , but at longer times ncdf4 delays the blurring and leads to a restored image with better quality .",
    "this control of the diffusion is confirmed in figures [ figrii_7]-[figrii_9 ] , which show , for the three models , the time evolution of the npb metric ( right ) and the corresponding first component of the solution of ( [ cd35 ] ) at the time for which the snr value is maximum ( left ) .",
    "( in each case this time corresponds to the iteration of the numerical scheme associated to the small circle in the figure on the right . )",
    "the reduction of the edge spreading is also observed in the detection of the edges by using the second components , see figures [ figrii_6a ] and [ figrii_6b ] .",
    "the evolution of the npb curve for ncdf4 implies the best quality in terms of blur perception , among the three models .",
    "in the present paper nonlinear cross - diffusion systems as mathematical models for image filtering are studied .",
    "this is a continuation of the companion paper , arajo et al .",
    "@xcite , devoted to the linear case . here",
    "the nonlinearity is introduced through @xmath0 , uniformly positive definite cross - diffusion coefficient matrices with bounded , globally lipschitz entries . in the first part of the paper well - posedness of the corresponding ibvp with neumann boundary conditions",
    "is proved , as well as several scale - space properties and the limiting behaviour to the constant average grey value of the image at infinity .",
    "the second part is devoted to some numerical comparisons on the performance of the filtering process from some noisy images using three models distinguished by different choices of the cross - diffusion matrix .",
    "the computational part does not intent to be exhaustive and instead aims to suggest and anticipate some preliminary conclusions that may motivate further research . as in the linear case ,",
    "the systems incorporate some degrees of freedom .",
    "this diversity is mainly represented by the choice of the cross - diffusion matrix .",
    "the numerical study performed here makes use of cross - diffusion matrices whose derivation was based on the choices made in gilboa et al .",
    "@xcite for the complex diffusion case , combined with the results on linear cross - diffusion .",
    "the numerical results reveal that the structure of the diffusion coefficients affects the evolution of the filtering process and the quality in the detection of the edges through one of the components of the system .",
