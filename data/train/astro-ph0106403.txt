    "spectroscopic properties of galaxies have provided valuable information on different aspects of galaxy evolution , such as star formation histories along the hubble sequence , chemical evolution of gas and stars , and the physical conditions associated with agn and starburst activity in the central regions of galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 , 1999 ) . in particular , spectroscopic studies of galaxies at optical wavelengths have played vital roles not only in determining the current and the past star formation rate but also in deducing the physical mechanisms relevant to the time evolution of star formation ( see kennicutt 1998 for a recent review ) .",
    "the change in the galactic global star formation rate with redshift has recently been investigated for a variety of different distant star  forming objects by many authors ( e.g. , madau 1996 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ; ellis 1997 ) .",
    "these recent works have suggested that optical data alone can not provide a comprehensive view of the star formation properties of distant galaxies owing to heavy dust extinction .",
    "a major and important challenge is to properly assess the extent to which the stellar light is affected by dust extinction .",
    "future near - infrared spectroscopic studies of the redshifted h@xmath9 emission from distant , dust - obscured galaxies is crucial to revealing the degree of extinction and reddening and thereby clarifying the real star formation histories of these galaxies ( kennicutt 1999 ) .    detailed spectroscopic studies of distant rich clusters ( dressler & gunn 1983 , 1992 ; couch & sharples 1987 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) have provided important clues as to the nature and evolution of galaxies in these dense environments . in particular ,",
    "dressler & gunn ( 1983 , 1992 ) discovered galaxies with no detectable emission lines but with very strong balmer line absorption ( the so - called `` e+a '' galaxies ) and concluded that such galaxies were `` poststarburst '' objects seen within @xmath10gyr of a severely curtailed burst of star formation .",
    "furthermore , couch & sharples ( 1987 ) made the first attempts to establish an evolutionary link between star - forming , poststarburst , and passively evolving galaxies observed in distant clusters .",
    "these attempts have been progressed significantly further by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) through their detailed modeling of an extensive data base of spectroscopic observations they obtained in 10 rich clusters in the range @xmath11 .",
    "the wealth of data allowed them to delineate the different spectral classes pertinent to distant cluster populations much more clearly , with three distinct classes of emission line object [ e(a ) , e(b ) , e(c ) ] being identified on the basis of the strength of [ oii]@xmath13727 emission and h@xmath2 absorption , two poststarburst classes ( a+k and k+a ) identified amongst galaxies with no detectable [ oii ] emission but enhanced h@xmath2 absorption , and a passive `` k '' class where neither of these features had any prominence .",
    "attempts were made to identify the evolutionary pathways between these different classes of object in order to identify the most likely progenitor to the sizeable population of poststarburst galaxies .",
    "galaxies with e(a ) spectra characterized by strong balmer absorption [ ew(h@xmath12 ] and relatively modest [ oii ] emission , were previously interpreted ( in the context of dust - free models ) as poststarburst galaxies with some residual star formation ( couch et al .",
    "however , poggianti et al s detailed spectral analysis and comparison with liu & kennicutt s ( 1995 ) sample of spectra for present - day merging galaxies suggested that the e(a ) types were more likely dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "this suggestion has subsequently been reinforced by the observation that a significant number of e(a ) galaxies are either luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , objects which are often dominated by dusty starbursts ( poggianti & wu 2000 ) .",
    "independent evidence for the presence and importance of dust in determining the observed properties of distant cluster galaxies has been presented by other authors .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that 5 out of 10 galaxies classified as either a+k or k+a types by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) in abell  851 ( at @xmath13 ) were detectable in deep 1.4ghz continuum maps obtained with the vla . with this radio emission most likely attributable to starburst activity",
    ", the lack of any such signature in the optical spectrum could only imply that it must be totally obscured by dust .",
    "further to this , owen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) investigated the radio properties of galaxies in a rich cluster at z @xmath14 ( a2125 ) which had large blue galaxy fractions ( 0.19 ) and found that the optical line luminosities ( e.g. , h@xmath9+[nii ] ) were often weaker than one would expect for the star formation rates implied by the radio emission .",
    "they accordingly suggested that dust obscuration , which is larger than is usually found locally , hides most of optical light from the star - forming regions .",
    "although these observational results have identified the possible importance of dust and dusty starbursts in distant cluster populations , little theoretical work has been done to address the formation and evolution of such galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to report the results of a _ numerical _ investigation of the spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies and possible evolutionary links between galaxies of different spectral class . using a one - zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model",
    ", we consider in particular , the degree to which dust extinction ( represented by @xmath0 ) depends on the age of the starburst populations and thereby try to clarify the time evolution in the equivalent width of the h@xmath2 absorption  and [ oii ] emission  line features .",
    "the main questions that we address are : ( 1)when and how does a disk galaxy hosting a dusty starburst develop an e(a)-type spectrum ?",
    "( 2)what are the requisite physical conditions for the formation of e(a ) galaxies ?",
    "( 3)can a dusty galaxy show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in its starburst phase ?",
    "( 4)are there any evolutionary links between the e(a ) , e(b ) , e(c ) , a+k , k+a , and k spectral types ?",
    "a key feature of our approach is to adopt the _ selective dust extinction _ framework originally proposed by poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) whereby the extinction suffered by a stellar population is inversely proportional to its age with the youngest populations having the greatest extinction .",
    "we confirm that such age - dependent extinction is essential to reproducing the spectral properties of the putative dusty starburst population in distant clusters .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in  2 , we summarize the numerical models used in the present study and describe briefly the methods for deriving spectral energy distributions ( seds ) affected by internal dust extinction . in  3 , we present our numerical results on the time evolution of dusty starburst galaxies in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane . in  4 , we discuss the possible evolutionary connections between the different spectral types ( e.g. , e(a ) , e(b ) , and k+a ) in the context of our dusty starburst models .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are given in  5 .",
    "in the present paper , each spectral class is defined as follows : e(a ) for galaxies with 5 @xmath15 ew([oii ] ) @xmath7 40 and 4 @xmath15 ew(h@xmath2 ) , e(b ) for 40 @xmath15 ew([oii ] ) and ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 4  , e(c ) for 5 @xmath15 ew([oii ] ) @xmath7 40 and ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 4  , a+k for ew([oii ] ) @xmath7 5 and 7 @xmath15 ew(h@xmath2 ) , k+a for ew([oii ] ) @xmath7 5 and 3 @xmath15 ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 7  , k for ew([oii ] ) @xmath7 5 and ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath7 3  .",
    "we adopt a one - zone chemical and spectrophotometric evolution model of a disk galaxy with a starburst , and thereby investigate the time evolution of the line strength of h@xmath2 absorption and that of [ oii ] emission , both of which are important properties for classifying the spectral types of galaxies in distant clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "the present model is essentially the same as that adopted in our previous studies ( shioya & bekki 1998 , 2000 ) , with the details of our treatment of chemical evolution given in shioya & bekki ( 1998 ) .",
    "accordingly , we describe only briefly the present spectrophotometric model .    one of the main differences between our model and previous ones ( e.g. , couch & sharples 1987 ; newberry et al . 1990",
    "; charlot & silk 1994 ; jablonka & alloin 1995 ; poggianti & barbaro 1996 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ) is that we explicitly include the effects of dust on both the photometric and spectroscopic properties of stellar populations as also the gaseous emissions . with this new development to our code",
    ", we can clearly demonstrate how the dust extinction affects the time evolution of the line strengths of h@xmath2 and [ oii ] ( ew(h@xmath2 ) and ew([oii ] ) ) in dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "we follow the chemical evolution of galaxies by using the model described in matteucci & tornamb ( 1987 ) which includes metal - enrichment processes of type ia and ii supernovae ( snia and snii ) .",
    "we adopt the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath16 , with upper mass limit @xmath17 and lower mass limit @xmath18 .",
    "we calculate the photometric properties of galaxies as follows : the monochromatic flux of a galaxy with age @xmath19 , @xmath20 , is described as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the monochromatic flux of a single stellar population with age @xmath23 and metallicity @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the time - dependent star formation rate described below . in the present study ,",
    "we use the spectral library gissel96 which is the most recent version of that published by bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the star formation history of a disk galaxy is characterized by three epochs .",
    "the first is the epoch of galaxy formation ( @xmath26 ) during which the interstellar gas is consumed by star formation at a moderate rate . in the present study",
    ", @xmath26 is 0 for all models .",
    "the second is @xmath27 at which the starburst begins in the disk . here",
    "@xmath27 is considered to be a free parameter .",
    "the third is @xmath28 at which @xmath29 star formation ceases is defined as the epoch at which the stellar mass fraction reaches a value @xmath30 in our models ; @xmath30 is also assumed to be a free parameter which controls the duration of starburst . throughout the evolution of disk galaxies ,",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to be proportional to the gas mass fraction ( @xmath31 ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a parameter which controls the star formation rate .",
    "this parameter @xmath33 is given as follows : @xmath34 in the following , we refer to these three different epochs as the `` prestarburst '' , `` starburst '' , and `` poststarburst '' phases , respectively .",
    "the value of the @xmath35 parameter , which controls the star formation histories of disk galaxies , is suggested to vary for different hubble types ( e.g. , arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath35 = 0.225 @xmath36 corresponds to a plausible star formation rate for sb disks ( e.g. , arimoto et al .",
    "1992 ) . in comparison , observations of starburst galaxies ( e.g. , planesas et al",
    ". 1997 ) would suggest that @xmath37 is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath37 = @xmath38 ) . by changing the value of @xmath37",
    ", we can investigate how the strength of a starburst influences the evolution in spectral type within a dusty galaxy .",
    "we adopt the selective dust extinction model investigated in detail by shioya & bekki ( 2000 ) . in this model , the amount of dust extinction associated with the starburst is assumed to depend on the age of stellar population : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are free parameters which control the the extinction at any given time during starburst . based on the monochromatic flux derived in equation ( 1 ) and the value of @xmath0 given by equation ( 4 ) , we calculated a ` dust - absorbed ' sed for galaxies of different age @xmath19 using the extinction law inferred by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and adopting the so - called screen model . to derive fluxes for various gaseous emission lines ( h@xmath2 and [ oii ] )",
    ", we first calculate the number of lyman continuum photons , @xmath42 , by using a non - absorbed sed .",
    "if all the lyman continuum photons are consumed in ionizing the surrounding gas , the luminosity of h@xmath43 can be calculated according to the relation : @xmath44 ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) . to calculate luminosities of other emission lines , e.g. , [ oii ] and h@xmath2",
    ", we use the luminosity ratios relative to h@xmath43 tabulated in pegase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , which are calculated for an electron temperature of 10,000k and an electron density of 1@xmath45 . the strength of absorption lines are derived using gissel96 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . thus the seds derived here comprise the following components : stellar continuum , gaseous emission , and stellar absorption .      shioya & bekki ( 2000 ) have already demonstrated the importance of selective dust extinction in reproducing e(a ) type galaxy spectra by comparing the model results with and without dust extinction . furthermore , they pointed out that a dusty starburst galaxy with selective dust extinction evolves from an e(b ) , to an e(a ) , to an a+k , to a k+a , and finally to a k type galaxy . since they have already indicated the fundamental role of the selective dust extinction in spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies , we detail here the parameter dependence of the spectroscopic evolution in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane . to demonstrate the importance of each of the six free parameters , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath27 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , and @xmath30 , we firstly compute a fiducial model ( model 1 ) with @xmath40 = 5.0 mag , @xmath41 = @xmath47 yr , @xmath27 = 7.64 gyr , @xmath35 = 0.225 gyr@xmath48 , @xmath37 = 2.25 gyr@xmath48 , and @xmath30 = 0.95 .",
    "model 1 can then be compared with a model without dust extinction ( model 2 ) , to show the typical behavior of selective dust extinction in the evolution of starburst galaxies on the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane .",
    "the dependence of the evolution on the six parameters , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 , and @xmath30 is then investigated via the computation of 17 models with a range of parameter values :    model 1 , 3 , 4,and 5 with different @xmath40 ,    model 1 , 6 , and 7 with different @xmath41 ,    model 1 , 8 , 9 , 10 , and 11 with different @xmath27 ,    model 1 , 12 , and 13 with different @xmath35 ,    model 1 , 14 , and 15 with different @xmath37 ,    and model 1 , 16 , and 17 with different @xmath49 .",
    "the parameter values are given in table 1 .",
    "we assume that the initial gas mass of the model galaxy is @xmath50 .",
    "figure 1 shows the star formation history and the color evolution ( in @xmath51 ) for the fiducial model ( model 1 ) with @xmath35 = 0.225 @xmath36 ( corresponding to sb  type star formation history ) . during the starburst ,",
    "the @xmath51 color becomes rather blue ( 0.2 mag at @xmath19 = 8.56 gyr ) due to the formation of massive stars .",
    "however , the color is not so blue compared with the model without selective dust extinction ( model 2 ) because of the heavy dust obscuration suffered by the young stellar population in the fiducial model .",
    "this result implies that selective dust extinction affects the global colors as well as the spectral characteristics of starburst galaxies .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the emission and absorption lines by plotting their strength at @xmath19 = 1 , 7.64 , 8.56 , 8.58 , and 13.0 gyr for the fiducial model . before the starburst ( @xmath19 @xmath15 7.64 gyr )",
    ", the model clearly shows a number of strong emission lines , whereas the absorption lines ( e.g. , the h@xmath2 absorption line ) are rather weak as a result of the continuous and moderate star formation . during the starburst ( 7.64 @xmath7 @xmath19 @xmath7 8.58 gyr ) ,",
    "the emission lines do not become so remarkably strong ; nevertheless , the star formation rate becomes more than a factor of five larger than that of the prestarburst phase .",
    "this is because the ionizing photons from very young ob stars are very heavily obscured by the dust .",
    "after the starburst ( @xmath19 @xmath5 8.58 gyr ) , the emission lines become even less remarkable due to the death of the young , massive stars and the intermediate  aged ones as well . on the other hand , the stellar absorption lines ( e.g. , h@xmath2 )",
    "become prominent after the starburst ( @xmath19 @xmath5 8.58 gyr ) owing to the presence of an older stellar population .",
    "figure 3 describes the time evolution of ew([oii ] ) and ew(h@xmath2 ) , which clearly demonstrates the importance of the selective dust extinction in the spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "the equivalent width of [ oii ] does _ not _ increase and is well below 40    during the starburst .",
    "the equivalent width of h@xmath2 becomes rapidly smaller just after the starburst begins , although the h@xmath2 line can still be observed as an absorption line .",
    "a few @xmath52 years after the starburst begins , the equivalent width of h@xmath2 becomes larger than 4 .",
    "consequently , this model reproduces the properties of the e(a ) class with ew(h@xmath2 ) @xmath53 and relatively modest [ oii ] emission , ew([oii])@xmath54  ; the location in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the physical reason for the successful reproduction of the model is clearly described in our previous paper ( shioya & bekki 2000 ) .",
    "the time scale during which the model is located within the e(a ) region is estimated to be @xmath55gyr .",
    "these results thus confirm the earlier suggestion of poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) of the vital role of selective dust extinction in reproducing e(a ) spectra .",
    "figure 5 shows the time evolution of spectroscopic properties in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane for models with different values of @xmath40 ( 1 @xmath7 @xmath40 @xmath7 10.0 mag for model 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 ) .",
    "since parameters other than @xmath40 are fixed at the same values adopted for the fiducial model , this figure demonstrates how the evolution of dusty starburst galaxies in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane differs according to the amount of dust extinction . as can be seen in the figure",
    ", the locus on the plane is appreciably different between the models , which implies that the degree of dust extinction ( represented by @xmath40 ) is an important influence on the observed spectroscopic evolution . during the starburst , the model with the larger @xmath40 shows weaker [ oii ] emission , weaker h@xmath2 emission , and stronger h@xmath2 absorption .",
    "thus the model with the largest @xmath40 ( e.g. , model 5 with @xmath40 = 10 mag ) is located towards the bottom ",
    "right of the e(a ) region during the dusty starburst .",
    "figure 6 describes the evolution in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane for the models with different values of @xmath41 ( @xmath56yr for model 1 , 6 , and 7 ) .",
    "parameters other than @xmath41 are fixed at the same values of the fiducial model .",
    "this figure clearly demonstrates that the time - scale during which young massive stars are heavily obscured by dust also governs the spectroscopic evolution . for the parameter range adopted here ,",
    "a larger number of young massive stars with different ages are obscured by dust for the model with larger @xmath41 , i.e. , the age - dependent dust extinction is weaker and thus young stars with different ages ( @xmath57yr ) are more uniformly obscured by dust .",
    "therefore , the model with larger @xmath41 shows lower ew([oii ] ) and higher ew(h@xmath2 ) and , as a result , is located in the bottom - right hand region of the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane during the starburst .",
    "we stress here that for the model with larger @xmath41 (= @xmath58yr and @xmath59yr ; model 6 and 7 , respectively ) , the time - scale during which the galaxies show an e(a)-type spectrum is appreciably shorter compared to the fiducial model .",
    "furthermore , the galaxies show a k+a / a+k spectral signature in the late phase of the starburst .",
    "this result suggests that not only the galaxies with e(a ) spectra but also those with k+a",
    "/ a+k spectra are possible dusty starburst candidates in distant clusters .    for the models with @xmath60yr ,",
    "not only young massive stars ( e.g. , ob stars )  which emit most of the ionizing photons  but also late b and a stars are strongly affected by dust extinction .",
    "hence a galaxy with a @xmath41 value of this size does not show strong h@xmath2 absorption during the starburst and poststarburst phases .",
    "therefore the galaxy can be located in k+a region even in the dusty starburst phase .",
    "this can be contrasted with models with @xmath61yr , where the emission lines from ionized gas regions around massive stars are not obscured so heavily by dust . as a result of this , even if we adopt a rather large value for @xmath40 ( i.e. , more than 10 mag ) , neither the [ oii ] nor h@xmath2 lines are weakened . in this case , a dusty starburst galaxy shows an e(b ) spectrum during its starburst phase .",
    "these results on the @xmath41dependences within our models confirms that age - dependent dust extinction is a crucially important factor for determining the spectroscopic properties of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "the present one - zone model , however , can not determine with any great certainty what controls the age - dependence ( i.e. , the parameter value of @xmath41 ) owing to the limitations of the model .",
    "we further discuss this problem in a later section .",
    "figure 7 describes how the star formation history and the evolution of spectroscopic properties on the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane are controlled by the parameter @xmath27 in dusty starburst galaxies . for models with a smaller @xmath27 ,",
    "the starburst occurs at earlier epochs and the magnitude of the starburst is larger .",
    "this is because there is more gas to fuel starbursts at earlier times .",
    "the evolution of galaxies on the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane is not so remarkably different between the models with different @xmath27 ( = 4.46 , 6.93 , 7.64 , 8.47 , and 9.45 gyr : corresponding to model 8 , 9 , 1 , 10 , and 11 , respectively ) .",
    "the model with smaller @xmath27 ( e.g. , model 9 ) , which represents a higher redshift starburst galaxy , shows discernibly lower ew([oii ] ) and higher ew(h@xmath2 ) and thus is located at the bottom - right of the e(a ) region during the starburst .",
    "this is primarily because a larger number of young massive stars are created and then obscured preferentially in the model with smaller @xmath27 .",
    "these results firstly imply that irrespective of the epoch at which a dusty starburst occurs , disk galaxies can exhibit an e(a ) spectrum during this phase if the extinction parameters are within certain reasonable ranges .",
    "secondly , they imply that the higher redshift dusty starburst galaxies are more likely to be located to the right and to the bottom of the e(a ) region in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane",
    ". it would be very interesting if future spectroscopic observations could confirm this predicted redshift - dependent behavior in dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "figure 8 describes how the evolution of starburst galaxies in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane depends on their prior star formation histories .",
    "the three models with sa ( model 13 ) , sb ( model 1 ) , and sc ( model 12 ) type star formation histories all pass through the e(a ) region during the starburst , which implies that a dusty starburst galaxy can show an e(a ) spectrum irrespective of its longer - term activity in its quiescent state .",
    "figure 9 shows the dependence of the spectroscopic evolution on the parameter @xmath37 controlling the strengths of starbursts in sb type disk galaxies . since parameters other than @xmath37 are the same between these models ( with @xmath37 = 1.0 , 2.25 , and 5.0 gyr@xmath48 , corresponding to models 14 , 1 , and 15 , respectively ) , this figure describes how the strength of a starburst in a galaxy determines the location of the dusty galaxy in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane . for the adopted parameter range ( @xmath62gyr@xmath48 ) ,",
    "the models show e(a ) spectra during starbursts , although the location of each model in the e(a ) region is different between these models : the models with larger @xmath37 ( i.e. , those with a stronger starburst ) show stronger ew(h@xmath2 ) and are thus located to the right of the e(a ) region .",
    "the two models with @xmath63 and 5gyr@xmath48 evolve from e(a ) to a+k galaxies whereas the model with @xmath64 , corresponding to a galaxy with a rather weak and longer starburst , evolve from e(a ) to k+a without passing through the a+k region .",
    "this result implies that dusty starburst galaxies that have undergone a rather weak starburst , are more likely to exhibit a k+a spectrum straight after the starburst .",
    "clearly the _ strength _ of the starburst is important to the evolution of a dusty starburst in the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane .",
    "figure 10 demonstrates how the evolution is dependent on the duration of the starburst .",
    "there is about 1.8gyr difference in the starburst duration between the models , with @xmath30 = 0.90 ( model 16 ) , 0.95 ( model 1 , fiducial model ) , and 0.99 ( model 17 ) .",
    "all three of the models pass through the e(a ) region during the starburst , albeit at different locations .",
    "the models with smaller @xmath30 values ( model 1 and 14 )  corresponding to those with the shorter starburst durations ",
    "evolve from e(a ) into a+k and then into k+a types during the starburst and poststarburst phases .",
    "in contrast , the model with the largest @xmath30 value and thus the longest starburst duration , evolves directly from an e(a ) to a k+a type without passing through the a+k spectral phase .",
    "( this dependence on @xmath30 is strikingly similar to that on @xmath37 . )",
    "this result implies that a dusty starburst galaxy with the longer starburst duration is more likely to show the k+a spectra in the poststarburst phase .    to summarize the above , weak [ o ii ] equivalent width during the starburst is favoured by large dust obscuration , obscuration which is slow to clear relative to the characteristic age of the starburst .",
    "furthermore , the location and movement within the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane of a dusty starburst galaxy during both the starburst and poststarburst phases has been demonstrated to be dependent on a number of parameters : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath27 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , and @xmath30 . in turn , these parameters could depend on the relative spatial distribution of gas and stars , the radial variation in the metallicity and density of the gas , the dynamical evolution of gas and stars , and the effectiveness of supernovae feedback in the evolution of the interstellar medium for a dusty starburst galaxy .",
    "the one - zone model adopted here is , by its very nature , unable to determine the extent to which these important factors ( e.g. , the relative spatial distribution of gas and stars ) are closely associated with the origin of the six parameters .",
    "this means that although the present study can indicate which of those parameters are important to the spectroscopic evolution of dusty starburst galaxies , it can not so clearly reveal the origin of the spectroscopic properties of the galaxies .",
    "thus future studies , in which the above five parameters are not treated as free parameters but as ones that can be predicted from a certain theoretical calculation are required to understand more clearly the origin of each spectral type ( e.g. , e(a ) ) in the context of distant cluster galaxy evolution .",
    "calzetti et al . ( 1994 ) and mayya & prabhu ( 1996 ) .",
    "have already proposed the idea that the older populations can be located at the outer part of molecular clouds and thus do not suffer so severely from dust extinction .",
    "poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) furthermore pointed out that stellar populations with the ages between a few @xmath8 and 1.5 @xmath65yrs , which are responsible for the strong balmer line absorption , have had sufficient time to drift away from the dusty molecular clouds where they were born .",
    "this selective obscuration of young stellar populations probably works effectively wherever a starburst occurs within molecular clouds .",
    "both shioya & bekki ( 2000 ) and the present study have demonstrated that if younger starburst populations are more heavily obscured by dusty gas than old ones in a galaxy , the galaxy shows an e(a)-type spectrum .",
    "this was first suggested by poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) , who also proposed that if the location and thickness of dust depended on the age of the embedded stellar populations in a starburst galaxy , then the effects it would have on its spectroscopic properties would be quite remarkable .",
    "why is it then that only some fraction of dusty starburst galaxies show e(a ) spectra ?",
    "moreover , when observing them in distant clusters , it should not be forgotten that their spectrum is an integrated one , comprising a luminosity - weighted ` mean ' of the light emitted over a large region of the galaxy .",
    "thus while the selective obscuration suggested by poggianti & wu ( 2000 ) is clearly important , it is the _ global _ ( 1001000pc ) rather than the local ( @xmath66pc ) processes that need to be investigated in in detail to explain the origin of the selective extinction .",
    "we point out here that a difference in the degree of dust extinction between the central ( @xmath15 a few 100 pc ) and outer ( @xmath67kpc ) regions of a galaxy ( @xmath3 1 kpc ) could produce the above age - dependent extinction effect . to be more specific , if a young stellar population is formed in a secondary starburst in the central region where there are greater quantities of dust and hence more dust extinction , its contrast in properties to the older and less obscured populations in the outer regions of the galaxy will make the extinction appear as though it is selective .",
    "this idea that the _ age _ of the stellar population varies globally with radius is not unreasonable and unrealistic , given that secondary starbursts occur preferentially in the central parts of galaxies due to the efficient inward transfer of gas driven by non - axisymmetric structure ( such as stellar bars ) and galaxy interaction and merging ( barnes & hernquist 1992 ; mihos & hernquist 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations of the gaseous and stellar distribution in merging disk galaxies ( which trigger a dusty starburst ) have demonstrated that the central young stellar component formed by a nuclear starburst , is more heavily obscured by dust than the outer , older component initially located in the merger progenitor disks ( bekki , shioya , & tanaka 1999 ) .",
    "bekki & shioya ( 2000 ) also demonstrated that since younger stellar populations are more centrally concentrated and the gas density is higher in the inner region , the mean gas density around stars ( which is critically important for @xmath0 ) depends strongly on stellar age in such a way that the density around younger populations is higher than that around older populations .",
    "therefore we strongly suggest that galaxies which undergo central dusty starbursts are more likely to show selective dust extinction .",
    "if the suggested radial dependence of stellar age and dust extinction is plausible and realistic , are there physical processes operating in distant rich clusters which have an equally realistic chance of causing it ? physical processes which are possibilities include : tidal galaxy interaction ( icke 1985 ; noguchi 1987 ) , tidal effects of cluster cores ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ) , galaxy ` harassment ' ( moore et al . 1996 ) , minor merging ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , unequal - mass merging ( barnes 1996 ; bekki 1998 ) , and major merging ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ) . given the high probability of high speed galaxy encounters in the rich cluster environment , galaxy harassment seems to be the most promising candidate .",
    "however it has the following three disadvantages in explaining the nature of e(a ) galaxies .",
    "firstly , the blue cluster galaxies of modest luminosity , i.e. in the luminosity regime where galaxy harassment is effective , show predominantly e(b) rather than e(a)type spectra ( poggianti et al .",
    "secondly , there is no clear tendency that e(a ) galaxies are preferentially located within the cores of clusters ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 ) , where galaxy harassment is most likely to trigger a starburst .",
    "thirdly , combined spectroscopic and morphological studies of the galaxies in distant clusters ( e.g. couch et al .",
    "1998 ) have not revealed any significant population of starburst objects which has the grossly deformed spiral arm pattern predicted by moore et al .",
    "of course these observations do not necessarily rule out galaxy harassment as a mechanism for forming e(a ) galaxies ; rather , if galaxy harassment is important , then it will produce only low luminosity galaxies located near the cluster core .",
    "the second observation above would also appear to rule out tidal effects within cluster cores as being important to e(a ) formation as well .    a rather high fraction ( @xmath3 50 % ) of low@xmath68lirgs and ulirgs  considered to be ongoing major mergers ",
    "are observed to have e(a ) spectra ( liu & kennicutt 1995 , poggianti & wu 2000 ) .",
    "the rate of galaxy merging is found to increase very steeply with redshift ( @xmath69 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "1999 ) and , furthermore , there is some evidence that this trend is seen amongst e(a ) galaxies ( dressler et al . 1999",
    "; poggianti et al .",
    "on the other hand , the e(a ) galaxies found in the distant cluster samples are predominantly _ disk _ galaxies , which makes it hard to reconcile them with being the products of major mergers , which tend to destroy any disk structure .",
    "we suggest , therefore , that minor and unequal - mass galaxy merging , which is different from major merging in that it can leave disk systems intact , is a more likely mechanism for reproducing the fundamental properties of e(a ) galaxies .",
    "mihos & hernquist ( 1994 ) demonstrated that minor merging can excite non - axisymmetric structure in a late - type disk , trigger nuclear starbursts , and transform the disk into an early - type system such as an sa or s0 galaxy .",
    "furthermore , unequal - mass merging between two disks has been demonstrated to create a disk with structure and kinematics strikingly similar to that of an s0 ( barnes 1996 ) . on that note ,",
    "bekki ( 1998 ) also found that such merging can trigger nuclear starburst , form a very gas - poor disk , and create bulge with characteristics remarkably similar to that of typical s0s .",
    "hence as well as contributing to the formation of dusty nuclear starbursts and thus to the radial dependence of dust extinction , this more minor type of merging may also provide an evolutionary link between late - type disks , e(a ) galaxies , and early - type disks ( s0s ) and thus account for the observed decrease in the cluster s0 fraction with redshift ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1996 ) . an early - type disk galaxy formed by a minor / unequal - mass merger , will experience a poststarburst phase ( with k+a / a+k spectra ) , and should contain a bulge remarkable for its young stellar population and thus bluer colors ( bekki 1998 ) . accordingly , a key observational test for assessing the relative importance of minor / unequal - mass merging in the formation of e(a ) galaxies with selective dust extinction , is to investigate the number fraction of disk galaxies with k+a / a+k spectra and prominent @xmath70 bulges in distant clusters .",
    "we now focus on the origin of the difference between the e(a ) and e(b ) spectral classes : why do some starburst galaxies show e(b ) spectra while others show e(a ) spectra ? we have demonstrated that the spectral type of a dusty starburst galaxy has a basic dependence @xmath40 in that it will exhibit an e(a ) or e(b ) spectrum if @xmath40 is large or small , respectively .",
    "poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) modeled the time evolution of the global colors and luminosities of distant cluster galaxies by using a stellar population synthesis code and found that the e(b ) galaxies were likely to evolve into sub ",
    "luminous systems once the starburst had ceased .",
    "they also found that the hii region metallicities of the e(b ) galaxies are significantly lower than those of galaxies in other spectral classes , and that these low metallicities were consistent with them being low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "these observational results suggest that one of the physical parameters that can govern the difference in spectral class is galactic luminosity .",
    "given our result that the spectral class of a dusty starburst galaxy depends on @xmath40 , this would imply that the luminosity and @xmath40 are somehow related .",
    "how can this be ?",
    "one possibility is that for the more luminous galaxies , the thermal feedback of supernovae explosions that occur during starbursts is simply not strong enough to blow off some fraction of the interstellar gas surrounding the young stars and thus to modify the spatial distribution of the gas .",
    "the key factor here is the deeper gravitational potential well of the galaxy which prevents the gas from escaping the galaxy . as a result of this , the mean gaseous density ( which is an important factor in determining @xmath40 ) continues to remain high , as also its dust extinction",
    "consequently , the galaxy can show an e(a ) spectrum .    for a less luminous galaxy ,",
    "most of the dusty interstellar gas can be blown away by the thermal feedback effect of the supernovae , as a result of the shallower gravitational potential .",
    "consequently , the density of dusty gas around the starburst populations is reduced as also the degree of dust extinction .",
    "the galaxy thus shows an e(b ) spectrum .",
    "hence we suggest that owing to the difference in the effectiveness of supernovae feedback in galaxies with different luminosities , galactic luminosity can determine the degree of dust extinction and optical spectral type .",
    "another possibility for the origin of e(b ) galaxies is that they are normal star - forming systems but with a significantly lower metallicity . although poggianti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that e(b ) galaxies must be starburst objects because a spiral - like star formation history was not able to produce strong enough [ oii ] emission , viz .",
    "however , this was based on models with solar metallicity and indeed poggianti et al .",
    "acknowledged that the relation between sfr and [ oii ] strength can change with metallicity . in estimating the strength of the [ oii ] flux for a galaxy with a given star formation rate , the h@xmath43 flux is first derived and then used to estimate the [ oii ] strength by adopting a certain [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio .",
    "accordingly , if less luminous and less metal - rich galaxies have a larger [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio , then they will have larger [ oii ] fluxes for a given star formation rate .",
    "the large [ oii ] fluxes observed in e(b ) galaxies could therefore be the result of such a metallicity effect rather than due to a high star formation rate .",
    "indeed , kobulnicky et al . ( 1999 ) have found that the [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio correlates with oxygen abundance ( 12+log(o / h ) ) in such a way that a galaxy with smaller gaseous metallicity is more likely to show a larger [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio .",
    "this observational result seems to support the above possibility that e(b ) are just normal star - forming galaxies with less metal - rich gas .",
    "if this is the case , we do not need to consider the reason why there are two different dusty starburst populations .",
    "smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that a significant fraction of the k+a population in abell  851 ( @xmath13 ) appeared as sources in deep vla 1.4ghz continuum maps of this cluster , and suggested that even k+a galaxies  classified _ optically _ by their lack of [ oii ] emission but moderately strong h@xmath2 absorption  can be systems hosting and ongoing dusty starburst .",
    "balogh & morris ( 2000 ) also found examples of k+a galaxies with h@xmath9 emission and , accordingly , concluded that some fraction of k+a galaxies are likely to be undergoing significant star formation .",
    "these observations have raised the following two questions : ( i)are such k+a galaxies really dusty starburst ones ? , and ( ii)what determines the spectral types of dusty starburst galaxies ( or , why are there dusty starburst populations with spectral characteristics , viz .",
    "e(a ) and k+a ) ? concerning the first question , smail et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that the radio emission from the k+a galaxies most likely had a starburst origin ( being the synchrotron radiation emitted from type ii supernovae associated with the newly formed population of massive stars ) with star formation rates of the order of 1030@xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "their ` poststarburst ' spectral signature at optical wavelengths would imply that this star formation was completely obscured . although this interpretation is plausible and consistent with other observational results such as color images , submillimeter fluxes , and the [ oii ] emission line strengths for these galaxies ( smail et al . 1999 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ) , we point out that an alternative interpretation is that there are significant spatial variations in star - forming activity across these galaxies , with the central regions in a ` poststarburst ' phase and the outer regions still in a ` starburst ' phase .",
    "the galaxy shows a k+a spectrum at optical wavelengths because the earlier @xmath74 star formation ( which forms the poststarburst population ) occurred more intensively than the @xmath75 ongoing star formation : the integrated spectrum is simply dominated by the light from the central poststarburst region . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the flux comes exclusively from the outer star - forming region .",
    "the validity of this interpretation can be assessed observationally , if the detailed two - dimensional spatial distribution of say h@xmath9 emission is mapped .",
    "furthermore , we can confirm whether smail et al.s interpretation of these objects is robust by investigating their infrared fluxes and thereby obtaining more accurate star formation rates .",
    "thus it is reasonable to say that future h@xmath9 and infrared observations will resolve this first question .    concerning the second problem",
    ", our present numerical results can provide some clues .",
    "our models for starbursts with @xmath41 = @xmath4 and @xmath8 show e(a ) and k+a spectra , respectively , which implies that the difference in @xmath41 yields the spectral type difference",
    ". the larger value of @xmath41 means that the age - dependence of dust extinction is weaker and thus interstellar dust uniformly obscures the starburst populations of different ages .",
    "accordingly , dusty starburst galaxies with k+a spectral types are likely to be formed , if younger stellar populations are not so preferentially obscured by dust ( i.e. , the selective dust extinction does not effectively work ) .",
    "if the difference in @xmath41 is really an important factor in explaining the origin of the e(a)/k+a dichotomy , the next question is what physical processes drive the @xmath41 difference .",
    "answering this question is obviously beyond the scope of this paper , because @xmath41 is a free parameter of the present one - zone model .",
    "however , we suggest that the difference in spatial distribution of stars , gas , and dust between dusty starburst galaxies is responsible for the @xmath41 difference . in our future papers , we will investigate how the radial distribution of stars and gas affects the spectral types of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "although the present one - zone model of dusty starburst galaxies has clarified some essential ingredients of the spectroscopic evolution of distant cluster galaxies , it has the following three limitations in analyzing the spectroscopic properties of galaxies .",
    "firstly , the degree of dust extinction ( represented by @xmath0 ) , which is one of the most important parameters in determining the seds of galaxies , is a free parameter in the one - zone model .",
    "@xmath0 is generally considered to depend on gaseous density , gaseous metallicity , dust composition , and the relative distribution of gas and stars ( e.g. , mazzei , xu , & de zotti 1992 ) and so is not calculated in principle by the one - zone model .",
    "secondly , the dependence of @xmath0 on the ages of the starburst populations is assumed in an arbitrary way and fixed for the one - zone model .",
    "the age dependence , which is another important factor in this context , depends on the relative spatial distribution of dusty gas and young stars and thus can not be predicted from the one - zone model .",
    "thirdly , the star formation history of a galaxy is freely controlled for the one - zone model .",
    "the time evolution of the star formation rate is suggested to be controlled by dynamical processes such as local gravitational instability in disk galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 , 1998 ) ; this is not addressed by the one - zone model since it is unable to follow the dynamical evolution of galaxies . in future work , we suggest that the above three properties ( e.g. , @xmath76 ) in the one - zone model should not be freely parameterized but predicted from theoretical or numerical studies so that spectroscopic properties can be investigated in a more self - consistent manner .    the most effective way to remove the above three limitations in the classical one - zone model of spectrophotometric evolution is to derive both the detailed distributions of gas , dust , and stars and the time - evolution of the star formation rate , by performing numerical simulations of dusty starburst galaxies . we have already developed a new code by which we can derive photometric evolution of galaxies based on the detailed spatial distribution of gas and stars and on the time evolution of star formation rate ( bekki & shioya 2000 ) . however , this code can not yet enable us to calculate spectroscopic properties of dusty starburst galaxies due to the time evolution of gaseous emission not yet being included . accordingly , an important future task is to derive emission line properties in numerical simulations . from now on , we refer to these future numerical simulations as ` spectrodynamical simulations ' , by which we can investigate not only spectroscopic properties but also morphological , structural , and kinematical ones .",
    "these will address the following five questions : ( 1)can younger starburst populations actually be obscured more heavily by dust than older ones , and what physical processes are closely associated with the suggested selective dust extinction ? ( 2)what determines the strength of the age - dependence of @xmath0 in dusty starburst galaxies and is the strength time - dependent ?",
    "( 3)how do physical processes specific to cluster galaxy evolution , such as galaxy harassment ( moore et al . 1994 ) and ram - pressure stripping ( farouki & shapiro 1984 ) , determine the relative spatial distribution of dusty gas and young stars ?",
    "( 4)are supernovae feedback effects important for explaining the spectroscopic properties of less luminous galaxies with e(b ) spectra ?",
    "( 5)what is the most important dynamical process for the origin of each of the spectral classes observed in clusters ?",
    "we have investigated the evolution in spectral properties of dusty starburst galaxies , adopting the fundamental assumption that the amount of dust extinction ( quantified by @xmath0 ) depends on the age of the stellar population according to : @xmath77 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are parameters controlling the degree of extinction and @xmath19 and @xmath78 represent the age of the galaxy and that of its stellar population , respectively .",
    "the main conclusions from this investigation can be summarized as follows :    1 .   if the young stellar populations ( with an age of @xmath79yr ) are more heavily obscured by dust than the older ones ( age@xmath80yr ) in a dusty starburst galaxy , the integrated spectrum of the galaxy is an e(a ) type characterized by strong h@xmath2 absorption and relatively modest [ oii ] emission .",
    "the time interval over which the galaxy exhibits an e(a ) spectrum is fairly long , lasting for @xmath55gyr of the @xmath81gyr duration of the starburst .",
    "2 .   there are requisite physical conditions for a dusty starburst galaxy to show an e(a ) spectrum .",
    "for example , the mean @xmath40 should be within a certain range ( @xmath82 ) . the age dependence of dust extinction",
    "also should be fairly strong in a sense that young stars with the ages of @xmath3 @xmath4 yr are preferentially obscured by dust .",
    "( i.e. , @xmath41 @xmath3 @xmath4 yr ; more selective ) .",
    "3 .   a dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a )",
    "spectrum will evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k ( or k+a ) spectrum , 0.2gyr after the starburst has ended , and then into one with a passive k - type spectrum , 1gyr after the starburst .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary link between the following spectral types : e(a ) , a+k , k+a , and k. 4 .",
    "the evolutionary path of a dusty starburst galaxy on the ew([oii])ew(h@xmath2 ) plane depends on the history of star formation within the disk before the starburst , the epoch , duration , and strength of the starburst , plus the adopted age - dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "for example , galaxies of later hubble type ( i.e. with smaller @xmath35 ) are more likely to pass through the bottom - right part of the e(a ) region during a starburst .",
    "5 .   for a plausible star formation history ,",
    "a starburst galaxy with the earlier burst epoch is more likely to show slightly lower ew([oii ] ) and slightly higher ew(h@xmath2 ) strengths .",
    "this result implies that a dusty starburst at higher redshift is likely to be located in the bottom - right part of the e(a ) region on the ew([oii])ew(h@xmath2 ) plane .",
    "a dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in the starburst phase , if the age dependence of @xmath0 is weak ( @xmath83 ) for a fixed @xmath40 .",
    "this result implies that if young massive stars with different ages ( @xmath57 ) are uniformly obscured by dust , the galaxy shows an a+k or k+a spectrum .",
    "the duration of a starburst can control the spectral type evolution such that a dusty galaxy with a longer starburst time - scale shows a k+a spectrum rather than an e(a ) spectrum during the starburst phase .",
    "this result , combined with the previous point implies that the origin of possible starburst k+a galaxies detected by vla radio observations ( smail et al .",
    "1999 ) can result either from the weak age - dependent dust extinction or from the relatively long starburst time scales in these dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that the dependence of @xmath0 on ages of young starburst populations is a crucially important factor for determining spectral types of galaxies .",
    "we furthermore stress that the age dependence can be closely associated with the relative distribution of dusty gas and young stars for dusty starburst galaxies in distant clusters .",
    "we will investigate the importance of the relative spatial distribution of gas and stars in determining spectroscopic properties of galaxies by using spectrodynamical simulations in our future works .",

    "we used the [ oii]/h@xmath43 emission line ratio ( adopting a value of 3.01 throughout this paper ; listed in the table of the pegase paper published by fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) to calculate the [ oii ] emission line strength of a dusty starburst galaxy from the derived h@xmath43 line strength in this work .",
    "it is important for us to confirm whether or not our results , described in the main body of the paper , change if we adopt a [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio different to that of the pegase model .",

    "based model can successfully reproduce the observational results for galaxies with @xmath84 @xmath15 8.5 .",
    "it should be noted here that the [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio is less than 3 ( corresponding to the value in the pegase with solar metallicity ) for @xmath88 and has a value of @xmath89 around solar metallicity ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this result suggests that the [ oii ] emission line strength calculated by pegase is appreciably larger ( by a factor of @xmath91 ) than that of cloudy .",
    "considering the above difference in the [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio between the two models , we investigate the evolution of a dusty starburst galaxy on the ew([oii])-ew(h@xmath2 ) plane for models 1 and 2 by using the cloudy code with solar - metallicity ( the corresponding [ oii]/h@xmath43 @xmath3 value is 2.08 ) . as is shown in figure 12 ,",
    "even if we use the cloudy code , our key results on e(a ) formation and spectral evolution do not change ( compare figure 4 with figure 12 ) .",
    "however , the two models based on the cloudy code show lower ew([oii ] ) than the pegase - based models during their evolution .",
    "this is a result of the smaller [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio ( 2.08 ) , which in turn makes ew([oii ] ) smaller . as a natural results of this ,",
    "the model with dust shows an e(c ) rather than an e(b ) spectrum during the actively star - forming phase just prior to the starburst .    for all of the present models",
    ", we assumed that the [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio is fixed at a certain value for all time steps in a model .",
    "this is actually an over - simplification , because the gaseous metallicity ( thus [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio ) in a galaxy evolves with time as the chemical evolution of the galaxy proceeds .",

    ", we will consider the dependence of the [ oii]/h@xmath43 ratio on the gaseous metallicity and thereby construct a more realistic and sophisticated model of the spectral evolution of dusty galaxies .",
    "lastly , we point out one disadvantage of the present model in deriving the [ oii ] line of dusty starburst galaxies .",
    "since we used the pegase code for the calculation of [ oii]/h@xmath43 , the temperature of the hii region in the present model with the pegase code is too low , in particular , for high metallicity , owing to the model s not allowing for any dust depletion onto grains in the hii regions . as a natural result of this , the [ oii ] line strength in the present model",

    "<S> this leads to three main results : ( 1)if a young stellar population ( with the age of @xmath3 @xmath4 yr ) is more heavily obscured by dust than an old one ( @xmath5 @xmath6 yr ) , the galaxy can show an `` e(a ) '' spectrum characterized by strong h@xmath2 absorption and relatively modest [ oii ] emission . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2)a dusty starburst galaxy with an e(a ) spectrum can evolve into a poststarburst galaxy with an a+k ( or k+a ) spectrum 0.2gyr after the starburst and then into a passive one with a k - type spectrum 1gyr after the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> this result clearly demonstrates an evolutionary link between galaxies with different spectral classes ( i.e. , e(b ) , e(a ) , a+k , k+a , and k ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3)a dusty starburst galaxy can show an a+k or k+a spectrum even in the dusty starburst phase if the age - dependence of dust extinction is rather weak , i.e. , if young starburst populations with different ages ( @xmath7 @xmath8 yr ) are uniformly obscured by dust . </S>"
