    "the only features that we know about the universal laws are that they are _ probability measures _ and that they charge every atom and in some special case that their ",
    "means \" are finite .",
    "we turn to an outline of the proof of theorem [ thm : main thm lim meas ] , and also the content of the various sections .",

    "we have @xmath124 uniformly for @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the ( geodesic ) distance in @xmath10 between @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath129 and for @xmath130 @xmath131 with @xmath132 thus for @xmath127 and @xmath128 roughly @xmath133 from each other @xmath134 is approximated by the universal kernel @xmath135 , whereas of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are a bit further apart , then the correlation is small .",
    "the estimate allows one to compute local quantities for the typical @xmath21 in @xmath119 , for example , the density of critical points ( see the ` kac - rice ' formula in section [ sec : bas conventions ] ) , or the @xmath25-dimensional volume of @xmath23 . while these are interesting and , in fact , useful for us , for example in bounding from above the betti numbers using morse theory , the topology of @xmath23 is global and lies beyond these purely local quantities .",
    "it was a major insight of nazarov and sodin  @xcite that most components @xmath31 of @xmath23 and @xmath29 of @xmath30 are small , that is are of diameter at most @xmath136 , and that the components that are further than this scale of @xmath133 apart are ( almost ) independent .",
    "this simultaneously semi - localizes the problem of the distribution of the topologies , and also explains the concentration feature that most @xmath21 s have the same distribution as well as the universality .",
    "moreover it separates the analysis into different parts .",

    "@xmath46 and @xmath48 are non - compact so that weak limits of probability measures need not be probability measures . in terms of technical novelty",

    "we prove the existence as weak limits of @xmath64 and @xmath66 associated with the @xmath138 s .",
    "the proof is relatively soft and follows closely the component counting analysis of @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that our random variables are conditioned to count a given topological type ( respectively tree end ) .",
    "this requires a number of modifications and extensions , especially of various inequalities ( see  [ sec : int geom sand ] ,  [ sec : bi(r-1,fx)<=bi(r , fxl)<=bi(r+1,fx ) ] ,  [ sec : glob upper bound ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : top nest not leak ] is devoted to a proof that the universal limit measures @xmath64 and @xmath66 are in fact probability measures .",
    "this requires establishing some tightness properties for the tails of our families of measures ( see proposition [ prop : grad bounded away ] ) .",
    "the kac - rice formula allows us to show that most components @xmath31 of a typical @xmath23 are gotten from @xmath139 with a bounded number of surgeries .",
    "however this is not sufficient to control their topologies uniformly . to limit these",
    "we examine further the geometries of the components .",

    "ends a similar but much simpler analysis gives the desired control on the geometry of nodal domains , yielding the corresponding tightness .",
    "section [ sec : full supp ] is concerned with a proof that for the @xmath138 s the limit measures @xmath64 and @xmath66 have full support ( i.e. that they charge every atom ) . for the cases",
    "@xmath140 this is straightforward ( see  [ sec : liminf>0 inter prf ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath99 presents us with a second technically novel problem .",
    "we resolve it for @xmath100 and for the measure @xmath141 in this section .",
    "this makes use of some auxiliary lemmas about approximating functions in @xmath142 , @xmath143 compact , by solutions @xmath144 of @xmath145 in @xmath146 .",

    "the recent paper  @xcite , which we will use as a reference , goes beyond that in that it allows @xmath150 to be bounded in the case of @xmath99 . for that they have to assume some properties of the geodesic flow for @xmath10 ; however , since we assume that @xmath151 ( in fact , @xmath152 for some @xmath153 ) , these results apply without any assumptions , yielding : uniformly for @xmath125 @xmath154 where @xmath155    hence if @xmath156 , @xmath157 where @xmath158 in particular if @xmath159 is fixed then we obtain the desired weyl asymptotics that we will use for the @xmath119 s .    for the monochromatic case @xmath99 , @xmath160 and",
    "hence @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 is the spherical haar measure on @xmath139 .",
