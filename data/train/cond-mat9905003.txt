    "the pioneering work of fermi , pasta and ulam  @xcite demonstrated that a periodic lattice of coupled nonlinear oscillators is not ergodic , and that energy in such a lattice may never be distributed uniformly .",
    "a great deal of work has followed that classic paper trying to understand how energy is distributed in discrete nonlinear systems  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the possibility of spontaneous energy localization in perfect anharmonic lattices has been a subject of intense interest  @xcite .",
    "the existence of solitons and more generally of breathers and other energy - focusing mechanisms , and the stationarity or periodic recurrence or even slow relaxation of such spatially localized excitations , are viewed as nonlinear phenomena with important consequences in many physical systems  @xcite .",
    "the interest in the distribution and motion of energy in perfect arrays arises in part because localized energy in these systems may be _ mobile _ , in contrast with systems where energy localization occurs through disorder .",
    "the interest also arises because such arrays may themselves serve as models for a heat bath for other systems connected to them @xcite .",
    "albeit in different contexts ,  perfect \" arrays serving as energy storage and transfer assemblies for chemical or photochemical processes are not uncommon @xcite .",
    "the study of anharmonic chains and of higher - dimensional discrete arrays has been less than systematic , certainly an inevitable consequence of the breadth and mathematical difficulty of the subject .",
    "some studies ( including the work of fermi , pasta , and ulam ) deal with microcanonical arrays .",
    "here one observes the way in which a given constant amount of energy distributes itself among the elements of the array .",
    "the notion of  temperature \" usually does not enter in these discussions , although such an association could be made if the energy is randomly distributed .",
    "other studies of anharmonic chains ( far more limited in number ) deal with systems subject to external noise and other external forces .",
    "the questions of interest here involve the ways in which noise can enhance ( as in noise - enhanced signal propagation@xcite ) or even totally modify ( as in noise - induced phase transitions@xcite ) the properties of the nonlinear array .",
    "even more limited has been the study of systems that are in thermal contact with one or more external heat baths maintained at a constant temperature @xcite . here",
    "the questions usually revolve around the robustness against thermal fluctuations of stationary or quasi - stationary solutions of the microcanonical problem . in both microcanonical and canonical systems ,",
    "some work concentrates on stationary states or long - time behavior or equilibrium properties of the array , while other work deals with transport properties or with the approach to equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , there is variation in the portion of the potential where the nonlinearity resides .",
    "thus , in some cases the elements of the array are themselves nonlinear while in others it is the coupling between elements that is nonlinear ( and , on occasion , both are nonlinear ) .    within this broad setting ,",
    "our interest in this paper focuses on one - dimensional arrays of classical oscillators in _ thermal equilibrium _  @xcite .",
    "an understanding of thermal equilibrium properties and the effects of nonlinearities on these properties is a prerequisite to the perhaps more interesting analysis of the nonequilibrium behavior of anharmonic lattices in the presence of thermal fluctuations and the approach to equilibrium in such systems . in particular , here we deal with the case of  diagonal anharmonicity , \" that is , the nonlinearity in our model is inherent within each oscillator in the array ( representing , for example , intramolecular interactions ) , while the connections between oscillators ( representing , for example , intermolecular interactions ) are ordinary linear springs .",
    "the anharmonicity may be soft or hard .",
    "we explore the conditions that lead to spontaneous energy localization in one or a few of the oscillators in the array , and the time it takes for a given energy landscape to change to a different landscape .",
    "one could undertake a parallel study in systems with anharmonic interactions between oscillators (  off - diagonal \" anharmonicity ) .",
    "we address such systems in subsequent work @xcite .",
    "the energy landscape is determined by the local potential of each oscillator , and by the channels of energy exchange in and out of each of the oscillators .",
    "the couplings between oscillators provide one such exchange channel , and the coupling of the array with the heat bath provides the other .",
    "we shall see that different arrays ( soft , hard ) behave very differently in response to these channels .",
    "we broadly anticipate our conclusions by revealing that 1 ) persistent energy localization occurs in arrays of weakly coupled soft oscillators even when strongly coupled to a heat bath ( while such localization is absent in the hard chain ) ; 2 ) persistent localization occurs in strongly coupled hard arrays provided they are weakly coupled to a heat bath ( while such localization is absent in the soft chain ) ; 3 ) quasi - dispersionless mobility of localized energy requires off - diagonal anharmonicity .",
    "these remarks point to the fact that our analysis of anharmonic chains in thermal equilibrium could start from two  opposite \" viewpoints . on the one hand",
    ", we might start by analyzing uncoupled oscillators in thermal equilibrium and then proceed to investigate what happens if we couple these oscillators to one another .",
    "this approach focuses on the entropic localization mechanism @xcite and the way in which the coupling between the oscillators eventually degrades it . on the other hand",
    ", we might start with a coupled isolated chain , focus on energetic localization mechanisms in such a chain @xcite , and then proceed to investigate the ways in which thermal fluctuations and dissipation affect such local structures .",
    "since we are explicitly interested in localization in the presence of thermal fluctuations , and since entropic effects have received far less attention than energetic ones , we choose to follow the former approach .",
    "no matter the sequence of our queries , since here our interest lies mainly in understanding energy localization in a nonlinear discrete array in _ thermal equilibrium _ and the way in which thermal effects depend on system parameters , we pose our questions as follows :    * how is the energy distributed in an equilibrium nonlinear chain at any given instant of time , and how does this distribution depend on the anharmonicity ?",
    "in other words , can one talk about _ spontaneous energy localization _ in thermal equilibrium , and , if so , what are the mechanisms that lead to it ?",
    "* how do local energy fluctuations in such an equilibrium array relax in a given oscillator ?",
    "are there circumstances in the equilibrium system wherein a given oscillator remains at a high level of excitation for a long time ? * can local high - energy fluctuations move in some nondispersive fashion along the array ?",
    "in other words , can an array in thermal equilibrium transmit long - lived high - energy fluctuations ( if indeed they exist ) from one region of the array to another without too much energy loss to dispersion ?    the answers to these questions have not been found analytically , and are for that reason most clearly presented in comparative fashion . starting with an ensemble of uncoupled oscillators at thermal equilibrium",
    ", one knows exactly the behavior of a _ single harmonic oscillator _ and can say a great deal about the behavior of a _ single anharmonic oscillator _ from general thermodynamic considerations .",
    "thus , for instance , the mean energy of a single harmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 is @xmath1 ( @xmath2boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "this energy is on average divided equally between kinetic and potential ( a partition that enters importantly in questions concerning landscape persistence ) .",
    "a simple virial analysis immediately shows that a soft anharmonic oscillator in thermal equilibrium has energy _ greater _ than @xmath3 while a hard anharmonic oscillator has energy _ smaller _ than @xmath3 .",
    "both share the property of the harmonic oscillator that the average kinetic energy is @xmath4 , but their average potential energies differ .",
    "one also knows exactly the energy fluctuations in a harmonic oscillator : the energy variance @xmath5 is equal to @xmath6 , and the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath8 is therefore independent of temperature .",
    "the energy fluctuations are easily determined to be greater in a soft oscillator and smaller in a hard oscillator . from these facts",
    "one can arrive at rather definitive qualitative conclusions regarding the distribution and persistence of energy in ensembles of single oscillators and the effects of the anharmonicities on these features  @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when such oscillators are connected to one another .",
    "not only can the oscillators now exchange energy with the heat bath , but there are also coupling channels whereby oscillators can exchange energy with one another .",
    "the interplay of these various energy exchange channels and the effects of anharmonicity on this interplay are some of the issues to be addressed in this work .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] we introduce our model and notation .",

    "in order to understand the equilibrium properties of a chain of oscillators it is useful to first review the behavior of single ( uncoupled ) oscillators described by the potentials in eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) .",
    "suppose first that our oscillator is _",

    "the harmonic oscillator has a single frequency at unity .",
    "the soft and hard oscillators oscillate at unit frequency at low amplitudes ( energies ) because we have chosen all the oscillators to coincide there , but with increasing amplitude the hard oscillator frequencies increase and those of the soft oscillator decrease . in fig .",
    "[ gfr ] we also show the period of oscillations @xmath30 .",
    "the period increases with increasing energy for the soft oscillator , remains constant for the harmonic oscillator , and decreases with energy for a hard oscillator .",
    "this behavior will figure prominently in our subsequent analysis of energy localization .",

    "@xmath8 for the three cases .",

    "each oscillator is connected to a heat bath .",
    "the grey scale represents the energy ",
    "an oscillator of higher energy is darker in this portrayal .",
    "the first thing to note is that along any horizontal line ( i.e. at any given time ) the soft landscape is darker and grainier than the harmonic , and the lightest and least grainy is the hard oscillator landscape .",
    "this reflects the fact that the soft oscillators have the highest energies and the greatest energy fluctuations .",
    "this observation provides a basis to be used in answer to the first question posed in the introduction . in an ensemble of independent oscillators in thermal equilibrium",
    "there is of course a greater energy in some oscillators than in others simply because there are energy fluctuations in a system in thermal equilibrium .",
    "these fluctuations are greater in soft anharmonic oscillators than in harmonic or hard anharmonic oscillators .",
    "= 4.in = 4.in = 4.in    = 3.9 in    the second noteworthy feature of the landscape illustrates the answer to the second question posed in the introduction , namely , how long it takes in an equilibrium ensemble for the fluctuations to relax and the energy landscape to change .",
    "the trend for our independent oscillators is clear : the soft oscillators retain a given energy for a longer time than do the harmonic , which in turn hold on to a given energy longer than do the hard oscillators .",
    "this is particularly evident for those oscillators that acquire a high energy through a fluctuation : in the soft oscillator landscape the dark streaks are clearly visible .",
    "the reason for this behavior becomes clear if we write the equation of motion for the energy @xmath37 for each oscillator .",
    "setting @xmath38 and using eq .",
    "( [ lang ] ) one finds that for any type of oscillator @xmath39 thus , the energy exchange with the surroundings involves only the _ momentum _ variable ( i.e. , the kinetic energy ) .",
    "consider an oscillator that has acquired a given high - energy fluctuation @xmath8 , and consider how this energy is distributed between the oscillator displacement and momentum . in a harmonic oscillator the energy during one cycle of oscillation is equally partitioned between kinetic and potential . in a soft oscillator , however , the energy spends relatively more time in potential than in kinetic form ( and the opposite is true for the hard oscillator ) .",
    "thus , during the major portion of the cycle the momentum of a soft oscillator is relatively low ( while its displacement is large ) ; the energy in the soft oscillator can therefore not enter from and leave to the thermal surroundings as easily as in the other oscillators .",
    "the energy relaxation process is therefore slower , and a soft anharmonic oscillator retains a high energy it might have gained via a fluctuation for a longer time  @xcite .",
    "the energy relaxation process visible in fig .",
    "[ surf2 ] is shown more quantitatively in fig .",
    "[ g12 ] . here",
    "we have plotted the normalized energy correlation function @xmath40 the inner brackets indicate an average over time @xmath41 ( 200,000 iterations ) and the outer brackets an average over an ensemble of 1000 oscillators .",
    "the correlation function is normalized so that all energies , high and low , contribute  equally . \"",
    "it is thus a measure of the full exchange of energy with the heat bath , both through the dissipative term and also via the fluctuations .",
    "we note that the trend in fig .",
    "[ g12 ] ( slower decay as the oscillators soften ) is consistent with the corresponding slowing trend for each temperature in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ pvse ] . also note that on average the energy of an oscillator changes on the time scale of half a period of oscillation , i.e. on the time scale it takes the oscillator to move from one side of the potential well to the other .",
    "we have thus summarized and illustrated our earlier findings  @xcite , namely , that in an array of independent oscillators in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature there are larger energy fluctuations and longer retention of energy the softer the oscillators .",
    "this is an entropy - driven localization , arising from the fact that the density of states in soft oscillators increases with increasing energy .",
    "it minimizes the free energy because it is entropically favorable for oscillators to populate phase space regions where the density of states is higher , which in an ensemble of soft oscillators leads to a greater spatial variability than in harmonic or hard oscillators .",
    "the temporal persistence of this greater variability is a consequence of the fact that coupling to a heat bath occurs only via the kinetic energy . in the soft ensemble",
    "the energy is in potential form a greater fraction of time than in kinetic form , which is not the case for the other ensembles .",
    "= 4.in = 4.in = 4.in = 4.in    we gave this scenario the name stochastic localization in our earlier work  @xcite , but will refer to it as _ entropic localization _ , a term that more accurately reflects its physical causes .",
    "it is important to stress that entropic localization in soft oscillators is robust in the sense that it becomes _ more _ pronounced as temperature increases provided the potential continues to soften , and that it is achieved regardless of the initial condition of the system .",
    "the remaining parameters that can be varied at this point are the _ dissipation parameter _ and the _ temperature_. a change in the dissipation parameter does not affect fig .",
    "[ pvse ] since this is an equilibrium distribution . in fig .",
    "[ surf2 ] a higher dissipation parameter would cause a more rapid decay of energy fluctuations ( and , correspondingly , a lower dissipation parameter allows an energy fluctuation to survive for a longer time ) .",
    "thus , although high dissipation does not interfere with the appearance of greater energy fluctuations in the soft oscillators , it works against the temporal retention of excess energy by any one oscillator .",
    "the energy correlation function decays more slowly for the soft oscillator for any dissipation , and this decay is more rapid ( for all the oscillators ) as the dissipation increases . in any case , for a given dissipation parameter the softer potential retains energy for a longer time .",
    "the temperature affects the quantitative outcome of figs .",
    "[ pvse ] and [ surf2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ pvse ] the distributions broaden with increasing temperature , but the differences between the different oscillators remain and , in particular , the fact that the distribution for the soft oscillator is the broadest continues to be true . in fig .",
    "[ surf2 ] higher temperatures produce relatively greater graininess in the soft oscillator figure than in the other two .",
    "this is clearly observed in the sequence of fig .",
    "[ surfsofteps ] , which shows the evolution of ensembles of soft oscillators for different temperatures .",
    "a temperature increase leads to stronger entropic localization and this effect also appears in the energy correlation functions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ corsofteps ] .",
    "this behavior is contrasted with that of harmonic and hard anharmonic oscillators , whose energy landscapes and energy correlation functions show essentially no temperature dependence in this range .",
    "the energy fluctuations in these latter cases dissipate very quickly .",
    "note that the temperature dependence of the correlation times implicit in fig .",
    "[ corsofteps ] is consistent with the temperature dependence of an average period of oscillation of a soft oscillator as shown in the right panel in fig .",
    "[ pvse ] : with increasing temperature the correlation time continues to be approximately half a period .    with this background ,",
    "we are now ready to consider the behavior of _ chains _ of oscillators , where everything that we have found so far has to be reconsidered in the face of the additional forces now present through the oscillator  oscillator coupling .",
    "in this section we explore the consequences of coupling the oscillators discussed in the previous section with harmonic springs . in this exploration we attempt to bring some order to seemingly contradictory reports that the coupled oscillators must be hard in order for such an array to localize energy effectively , or that the coupled oscillators must be soft in order to accomplish such localization . to anticipate our results : we will show that both claims are correct , but each in a different parameter regime and for different physical reasons .",

    "@xmath42 , and the _ coupling strength _ @xmath15 .",
    "= 4.0 in    in order to determine the conditions that may lead to energy localization in a thermalized chain of oscillators it is useful to investigate the ways in which energy may escape from a given oscillator .",
    "it is apparent from the langevin equation ( [ lang ] ) that there are now two channels of escape . as in the last section ,",
    "one is the friction term that dissipates the energy to the bath .",
    "the other is the coupling term that transfers energy to the nearest neighbors .",
    "the difference between these two mechanisms is that the dissipation is determined entirely by the kinetic energy of the oscillator .",
    "energy transfer along the chain , on the other hand , while still dependent on the kinetic energy , is primarily determined by the extension or contraction of the springs connecting neighboring oscillators , that is , by the potential energy through the relative oscillator displacements . to make these statements more quantitative ,",
    "it is useful to generalize the concept of a local energy by defining a local function whose sum over sites is the total energy of the chain .",
    "to include the contribution from the nearest - neighbor restoring forces one writes @xmath43 , \\label{localenergy}\\ ] ] and the total energy of the system is then @xmath44 .",
    "the rate of change of the local energy is easily found to be @xmath45 note that although this expression does not explicitly involve the potential , the rate of local energy loss of course does depend on the potential through the displacements and momenta .",
    "the dynamics of the local energy will thus depend on the interplay of the thermal ( fluctuations ) , dissipative , and intrachain forces . in order to highlight the main comparisons and contrasts , we frequently will juxtapose the behavior of chains for which one or the other of the energy exchange channels is clearly the dominant one , and in each case assess the effects of temperature changes .",

    "our particular interest lies in the characterization of possible spatial energy localization in such systems , and of the temporal persistence of such localization .",
    "the instantaneous localization of energy of a system in thermal equilibrium is a manifestation of the thermal fluctuations : it is an equilibrium property unrelated to system dynamics .",
    "we argued that not only do soft anharmonic chains have a higher total energy at a given temperature than do harmonic or hard chains , but also that thermal fluctuations are more pronounced in the soft anharmonic chains .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that free energy maximization favors the occupation of phase space regions with a high density of states .",
    "the density of states increases with energy in a softening potential , so it is entropically favorable for a few soft oscillators to have rather high energies .",
    "this in turn leads to greater spatial energy variability than in harmonic or hard chains , that is , soft chains have  hotter spots . \" the effect becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature .",
    "this entropic energy localization mechanism in soft chains is degraded as the harmonic intersite potential increases because the harmonic contributions become dominant over the local soft anharmonicity effects .",
    "in addition to the capacity for instantaneous localization of energy ( which is greatest in soft chains ) , one is interested in the temporal degradation of a high energy fluctuation .",
    "that is , given a  local hot spot \" ( which is easier to find in soft chains , but nevertheless does occur in harmonic and hard chains due to thermal fluctuations ) , how does such a fluctuation evolve in time ? such a fluctuation never grows spontaneously , nor does it persist indefinitely .",
    "rather , it eventually degrades , either through dissipation into the bath or through dispersion along the chain .",
    "the rate of dissipation into the bath depends on the value of the dissipation parameter and also on the _ kinetic _ energy of the oscillators .",
    "if the dissipation parameter is small , this channel is of course slow for any chain .",
    "however , even if the dissipation parameter is large , dissipation can still be slow if the energy is not primarily in kinetic form .",
    "this is the case for soft chains provided the interatomic potential is weak ( since otherwise the chain is essentially harmonic ) . in soft chains",
    "the energy is in potential form for a longer fraction of the time than in the other chains .",
    "as temperature is increased , this effect becomes more pronounced because ever softer portions of the potential become accessible , and the energy is stored as potential energy a greater fraction of the time .",
    "thus an increase in temperature in weakly coupled soft chains leads not only to greater energy fluctuations but also to a slower decay of these fluctuations . _    energy dispersion along the chain depends on the magnitude of the coupling constant and also on the relative oscillator displacements .",
    "if the coupling constant is small , this channel is slow for any chain .",
    "if it is large , then this channel can still be slow if relative displacements of neighboring oscillators are small .",
    "this is the case for the hard chain , where displacements are relatively small and do nt change much with increasing energy .",
    "furthermore , because in a hard oscillator the frequency increases with increasing energy , there is a frequency mismatch between a  hot \" oscillator and its  colder \" neighbors that further impedes energy transfer .",
    "this leads to greater persistence of local high - energy fluctuations with increasing temperature .    _",
    "thus an increase in temperature in weakly dissipative hard chains leads not only to greater energy fluctuations but also to a slower decay of these fluctuations .",
    "_    the soft chain , on the other hand , increasingly loses its soft character as the interoscillator energy transfer channel strengthens , and therefore both the landscape and the dynamical effects of anharmonicity quickly disappear as this coupling constant is increased .",
    "finally , we showed that in harmonically coupled nonlinear chains ( that is , in chains with  diagonal anharmonicity \" ) in thermal equilibrium , high - energy fluctuation mobility does not occur beyond that which is observed in a harmonic chain .",
    "the situation might be quite different if there is  nondiagonal anharmonicity \" , that is , if the interoscillator interactions are anharmonic .",
    "our results on these systems will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "further presentations will also deal with bistable  impurities \" connected to chains of the types that we have considered here @xcite .",
