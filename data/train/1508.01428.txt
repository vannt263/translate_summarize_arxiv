    "the gravitational potential proposed by miyamoto and nagai ( 1975 ) ( mn ) is well known .",
    "its applications to models of the milky way and other disc galaxies are numerous ( e. g. allen santillan 1991 , ninkovi ' c 1992 , dinescu et al . 1999 ,",
    "macmillan & binney 2011 ) .",
    "the observational evidence is in favour of exponential discs characterised by the dependence of the circular speed on the distance to the centre ( rotation curve ) as given in freeman s paper ( 1970 ) . as to the fitting of the circular - speed dependence resulting from the miyamoto - nagai formula to freeman s curve",
    ", there are some difficulties indicated in an earlier paper of the present author ( ninkovi ' c 2003a ) . in the present paper a new formula for the gravitational potential",
    "is proposed .",
    "it appears as a generalisation of mn and it contains the formula analysed in the earlier paper ( ninkovi ' c 2003a ) as a special case .",
    "the density generating this potential as function of the coordinates is also studied .",
    "the gravitational potential in stellar systems ( subsystems ) , such as , for instance bulges and discs of spiral galaxies , is often represented by a variant of the green formula ( e. g. cuddeford 1993 ) .",
    "this would mean that in general the gravitational potential @xmath0 should have the following form    @xmath1    where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants , whereas @xmath4 is a function .",
    "the first constant ( @xmath2 ) is the universal gravitation constant , the second one ( @xmath3 ) is the total mass of the system ( subsystem ) appearing as the source of the gravitational field .",
    "@xmath4 is a function of the generalised coordinates and time .",
    "it must satisfy the following conditions : to have dimension of length and to be approximately equal to the distance from the centre of the source system @xmath5 at the points lying very far from the system centre .",
    "the potential of a flattened stellar system , as here of interest , is assumed to depend on two arguments : @xmath6 , distance to the axis of symmetry @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , distance to the midplane .",
    "the function proposed by miyamoto and nagai ( 1975 ) is a well - known example    @xmath9^{1/2 } \\ \\ .\\ ] ]    in this function @xmath10 and @xmath11 are constants and for significantly flattened systems satisfy @xmath12 . when the function @xmath13 is substituted in equation ( 1 ) , one obtains the miyamoto - nagai potential formula .",
    "the present author proposes here a potential formula which contains a new term @xmath14 , as follows    @xmath15    in a general case the new term @xmath14 is also a function of the same two variables , @xmath6 and @xmath8 and is everywhere positive .",
    "since @xmath13 satisfies the condition of being approximately equal to the distance @xmath5 at the points lying very far from the system centre , the new term at such points must be negligibly small compared to @xmath13 . in this way",
    "the difference @xmath16 will satisfy the condition of being approximately equal to the distance from the centre @xmath5 at very distant points .",
    "the surface density of the disc of a spiral galaxy , bearing in mind the observational constraints , is usually assumed to be exponential ( often referred to as freeman law ) , for instance its luminosity or mass density @xmath17 obeys the following formula ( e. g. deg & widrow 2013 , their equation ( 13 ) )    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants . as easily seen , the surface density following from this expression will depend on @xmath6 as a simple exponential function with @xmath19 as the scale length .",
    "unfortunately , equation ( 4 ) yields no analytical solutions for the potential via the poisson equation .",
    "this is important because with the known potential it is possible to obtain the circular speed @xmath21 by using the well - known relation    @xmath22    the plot of circular speed versus distance @xmath6 according to freeman s solution ( fig .",
    "1 ) is characterised by existence of radius at which the circular speed is the same for the keplerian and exponential disc cases of the same mass . as a consequence , at infinity the circular speed for the exponential disc",
    "approaches the keplerian curve from `` above '' , i. e. from higher values of @xmath21 .",
    "this is not the case with the potential formula of miyamoto and nagai .",
    "substituting equation ( 2 ) in equation ( 1 ) and applying ( 5 ) one obtains the dependence of the circular speed on @xmath6 corresponding to the miyamoto - nagai potential . since @xmath23",
    ", the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 enter the circular - speed dependence always through their sum @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the flattening expressed by means of @xmath25 , does not affect the circular - speed dependence .",
    "the maximum circular speed occurs at about @xmath26 and the circular - speed value resulting from the miyamoto - nagai formula is everywhere smaller than the value yielded by the keplerian dependence for the same total mass .",
    "due to this a good fit between the circular speed following from the potential of miyamoto and nagai and that corresponding to the exponential disc is achieved at the cost of different total masses .",
    "usually the total mass in the miyamoto - nagai formula is about 1.5 times as large as that of the exponential disc ( e. g. ninkovi ' c 1992 ) .",
    "the purpose of introducing the new term @xmath27 ( equation ( 3 ) ) is to reproduce the property of intersection with the keplerian curve and to have the same total mass as for the exponential disc .",
    "as shown earlier ( ninkovi ' c 2003a ) , this is possible even with a constant substituted for @xmath27 .",
    "the constant introduced here will be @xmath19 , the scale length .",
    "then in the fitting the rotation curve one should determine the ratio @xmath28 . according to the definition assumed in the present paper ( equation ( 1 ) )",
    "the potential can not have negative values , so this ratio must be greater than 1 .",
    "we find a best fit value of 2.1 .",
    "the fit can be further improved .",
    "this is done by generalising the term @xmath27 in the following way    @xmath29 \\ \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 though it may seem that the number of parameters now tends to be too large , this is not the case in practice .",
    "for instance , @xmath19 is quite acceptable to be substituted for @xmath32 .",
    "the second term in equation ( 6 ) ( the function of @xmath8 ) is foreseen because of the density distribution the potential returns ( see next section ) .",
    "with regard to all equations written above except ( 4 ) one obtains the following expression which yields the circular speed    @xmath33",

    "they are presented together with the corresponding curve from freeman s ( 1970 ) paper .",
    "the dimensionless variables , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are defined as : @xmath35 , @xmath41 .",
    "the comparison requires the scale lengths @xmath19 and the total masses @xmath3 to be equal in both formalisms .",
    "the density which generates a gravitational potential and the potential are related through the poisson equation    @xmath42    @xmath43 is the laplacian , @xmath17 is the density .",
    "the full formula is given in the appendix .",
    "in the density calculation the constants @xmath32 and @xmath44 ( equation ( 6 ) ) , as well as the ratio @xmath25 , must be specified .",
    "the fit for the rotation curve has yielded @xmath37 , under the condition @xmath45 ( flattened mass distribution ) , so it is easy to conclude that @xmath10 is approximately @xmath46 . in such conditions",
    "the first term within the brackets in equation ( 6 ) should not differ substantially from 1 .",
    "as for the second one , a too small @xmath44 can contribute to significant values of @xmath14 , for instance @xmath47 , leads to such a high @xmath14 that the denominator in equation ( 3 ) becomes negative and , as a consequence , the potential , contrary to the convention assumed here , becomes also negative .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume @xmath48 .    in spite of introducing the new term @xmath14 ( equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) ) negative density values can not be avoided . in the midplane",
    "the density is nowhere negative .",
    "its dependence on @xmath6 in @xmath23 is a monotonously decreasing function . as for the dependence @xmath49 , @xmath50 ,",
    "there are three types of profiles : i ) with a minimum @xmath51 and then approaching zero from the negative side ( fig .",
    "2 ) ; ii ) a wavy profile , with one minimum and one maximum and then approaching zero , along @xmath52 both extrema can be positive , in general the minimum is negative , the maximum positive ( fig .",
    "3 ) ; iii ) a sound profile , without negative values and monotonously decreasing , but obtained along @xmath52 only ( fig .",
    "4 ) . in order to be more clearly visible",
    "the most essential part of the curve is magnified and given in the same figure ( fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ) .    in the simplest case - @xmath53 ( equation ( 6 ) ) - the density dependence @xmath49 , @xmath50 , is always of type i ) ( fig .",
    "the @xmath7 value at which the density minimum occurs depends on @xmath6 , the smaller @xmath6 is , the closer is the minimum to the midplane .",
    "finally , when @xmath6 tends to infinity , the @xmath7 value also tends to infinity , because the density tends to zero .",
    "when the term @xmath14 ( equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) ) takes a functional form , i. e. both @xmath54 and @xmath55 are non - zero , the dependence @xmath49 , @xmath50 , changes the form , towards the types ii ) and iii ) . for @xmath54",
    "some kind of critical value appears at which the dependence @xmath49 , @xmath52 , obtains the form iii ) ( fig .",
    "4 ) . it should be @xmath56 , the modulus is affected by the ratio @xmath25 .",
    "for instance , for the pair of values @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the critical value is @xmath34 , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , the corresponding is @xmath61 , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , etc .",
    "the influence of @xmath55 is not so strong ; it is better to be @xmath65 , but increasing @xmath55 leads to weaker decreasing of @xmath17 with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the most important is that increasing the modulus of @xmath54 further does not improve the situation , as the negative density values remain and the wavy profiles survive ( fig .",
    "3 ) . however , the moduli of both exponents @xmath54 and @xmath55 are limited .",
    "as for the former , the main limitation comes from the fit of the rotation curve , in the case of the latter , since it is supposed to be positive , the physical limitation ( @xmath66 ) becomes essential .",
    "the final conclusion is that the best achievable result is to obtain a monotonously decreasing density along @xmath52 and wavy density profiles along cylinders @xmath67 . for the purpose of giving a more clear explanation the following example is chosen .",
    "the values of the parameters in equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) are : @xmath37 ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath48 , @xmath34 , @xmath69 . the rotation curve ( fig .",
    "1 - red curve ) and the density profiles ( fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 ) correspond to this example .",
    ", for @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( see equation 6 ) ; distance unit @xmath72 , density unit @xmath73 @xmath74,width=321 ]    , for @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( see equation 6 ) ; distance unit @xmath72 , density unit @xmath73 @xmath74,width=321 ]    , for @xmath52 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( see equation 6 ) ; distance unit @xmath72 , density unit @xmath73 @xmath74,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show another density comparison , typical for @xmath53 , corresponding to the same @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath25 . the wave ( fig .",
    "3 ) can be explained by the rather rapid density decrease with increasing distance to the midplane . beyond the centre the density values in the midplane are generally low , significantly lower than at the centre , so that at reasonable distances to the midplane they are practically zero .",
    "here one obtains the density values by using the poisson equation ( 8) which in the case of axial symmetry means as the algebraic sum of three terms ( see appendix ) . clearly , in a numerical procedure instead of",
    "density values of exactly zero we usually have values of low moduli with both signs . in this way",
    "the wavy density profiles obtained here can be easily understood as due to numerical precision issues .",
    "the present author proposes an analytical form for the gravitational potential which would correspond to the exponential disc , the most luminous subsystem of a spiral galaxy .",
    "this is done by modifying the well - known formula of miyamoto and nagai ( equations ( 1)-(3 ) and ( 6 ) ) . in this modification",
    "there are three essential parameters : the total mass @xmath78 , the exponential scale length @xmath19 and the other scale length @xmath11 .",
    "the other three parameters - @xmath10 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are auxiliary .",
    "their role is to improve the fit of the rotation curve particularly , their values are limited .",
    "since the system ( subsystem ) under study is flattened , it must satisfy @xmath79 , and bearing in mind the constraint based on the rotation curve , one obtains @xmath80 .",
    "the exponents @xmath54 and @xmath55 can not exceed 0.5 and @xmath54 is constrained to be small and negative , while @xmath55 lies in @xmath81 . thus an exponential disc modeled in the way as proposed here",
    "should be generally characterised by its total mass and two scale lengths .",
    "though negative density values can not be avoided completely , the functions in the new term ( equation ( 6 ) ) contribute to a significant reducing of this effect .",
    "a discussion concerning the analogous spherical - symmetry model can be found in ninkovi ' c , 2003b .",
    "this research has been supported by the serbian ministry of education , science and technological development ( project no 176011 `` dynamics and kinematics of celestial bodies and systems '' ) .",
