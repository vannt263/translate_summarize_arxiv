    "as the first topologically ordered phase , the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is a remarkable achievement in condensed matter physics@xcite . in qhe state , at low temperatures and in strong magnetic fields , quantized hall conductance can be observed due to the landau levels formed by states of a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "just one year later , people discovered the so - called anomalous hall effect where additional hall current in the ferromagnetic material was observed@xcite .",
    "then , people find that the transverse transport also exists for different spin species , which is called as spin hall effect@xcite .",
    "recently , the topological insulators including the quantized spin hall ( qsh ) effect@xcite and the quantized anomalous hall ( qah ) effect@xcite become hot issues .    on the one hand , to describe the quantized anomalous hall state , a class of topological insulators with time - reversal symmetry breaking , the chern number , so called tknn integer ,",
    "is introduced as integrals over the brillouin zone ( bz ) of the berry field strength @xcite @xmath1here @xmath2 is a berry connection for single - electron hamiltonian with the periodic part @xmath3 of a bloch state @xmath4 .    on the other hand , for quantized spin hall state the spin chern number @xmath5",
    "is proposed in ref.@xcite to be the topological invariant to characterize the topological insulators . however , due to spin mixing term ( the rashba term ) , the spin chern number @xmath6 is not well defined .",
    "thus for a class of topological insulators with time - reversal symmetry ( t - symmetry ) , due to kramers degeneracy , kane and mele proposed a @xmath7 topological invariantkane , roy06,moore06,fu06,essin07 @xmath8where @xmath9 are the four high - symmetry points satisfying @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the parity eigenvalue at each of these points , and @xmath15 is the number of kramers pairs below fermi surface .",
    "such @xmath7 topological invariant can be also defined in terms of the spin chern number @xmath16here the integral of the berry field strength is defined on half of the brillouin zone .",
    "physically , @xmath17 is identical with the number of pairs of helical edge modes .",
    "thus , an interesting issue is the nature of the quantum phase transitions between different types of topological insulators .",
    "it is well known that in landau theory different orders are classified by _",
    "symmetries_. the phase transitions accompanied with ( global ) symmetry breaking are always described by order parameters",
    ". however , landau s theory fails to describe the topological quantum phase transition ( tqpt ) .",
    "such type of quantum phase transition can not be classified by symmetries@xcite . instead",
    ", they may be characterized by some topological `` order parameters '' , such as the chern number or @xmath7 topological invariant@xcite .    in this paper , we study the tqpts between topological insulators and show their physical properties .",
    "we find that there are universal features of the tqpts for different cases : the existence of nodal fermions at high symmetry points , the non - analytic third derivative of ground state energy and the jumps of the topological `` order parameters '' .",
    "in particular , we find the _ symmetry protected _ nature of the tqpts : different tqpts are protected by different ( global ) symmetries and then described by different topological `` order parameters '' .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii ,",
