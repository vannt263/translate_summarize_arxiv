    "transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) parton distributions are necessary to study less inclusive processes in high energy heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "tmd parton distributions contain more information about the parton small-@xmath0 degrees of freedom than the integrated parton distributions and require a new factorization formalism which is different from the traditional collinear factorization @xcite .",
    "tmd s have attracted much interests in recent years @xcite .",
    "there are two different unintegrated gluon distributions usually encountered in the literature @xcite .",
    "the conventional unintegrated gluon distribution is related to the color dipole scattering amplitude , and most known processes are related to it @xcite .",
    "another unintegrated gluon distribution is constructed by solving classical yang - mills equations of motion in the mclerran - venugopalan model , a simple model used to study the small-@xmath0 gluon distribution in the saturation region for large nuclei @xcite . in a light cone gauge ,",
    "the valence quarks of a nucleus are treated as static color sources , and the gluon fields of the sources add coherently then become the non - abelian weizscker - williams ( ww ) @xmath1 field of the nucleus .",
    "the ww gluon distribution is quite different from the conventional unintegrated gluon and a few physical processes which can directly probe this gluon distribution are known @xcite .    in this paper , we study nucleus - nucleus collisions analytically",
    ". we always assume the strong coupling constant @xmath2 , but take @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the atomic number of a nucleus , to be a large parameter .",
    "we further assume that there is no qcd evolution in the gluon distributions of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "instead of considering difficult processes , such as gluon production @xcite , whose final state interactions are very complicated , we will limit ourselves to a much simpler case where the produced particle is color - neutral .",
    "we always assume that the mass of the scalar particle , @xmath5 , is much larger than the saturation momentum @xmath6 .",
    "the effective interaction we will use is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a scalar field .",
    "this effective interaction is used to studied higgs production in pp and pa @xcite , however , the phenomenological aspect is not our major interest in this paper .",
    "the advantage of using such an effective interaction in a study of nuclei collisions is that we do not have to worry about the final state interactions of the produced particle , all the effects are from the initial state of the nuclei .",
    "therefore , we can view the process as follows : the gluon fields in the two nucleons are developed independently and gluon distributions are formed within each nucleus before the collision . during the collision",
    "the gluon fields are released by the nuclei and the scalar particle is produced .",
    "after the collision the nuclei have to rebuild their gluon fields which would induce further gluon radiation but it is irrelevant to the current problem because the particle is color neutral and knows nothing about the rebuilding processes .",
    "this simple physical picture is exactly what we have in the color glass condensate framework , and the transverse momentum distribution that manifests itself in this process is the ww gluon distribution , which comes from neglecting the rebuilding processes of the gluon field of the nucleus . in a light cone ( lc ) gauge , the cross section , , is factorized into a production of two unintegrated gluon distributions and involves a new gluon distribution , the so - called linear polarized gluon distribution @xcite . in different kinematic regimes",
    "the cross section takes different forms . when @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the transverse momentum of the scalar particle , the cross section becomes a product of two ww gluon distributions of the two nuclei in coordinate space .",
    "therefore , we also manage to find a process that can probe the ww gluon distribution in addition to the dijet production discussed in @xcite . if @xmath11 , the cross section is factorizable as given by .",
    "the major question in the study of nuclear collisions is deciding what gauge to use .",
    "gluon distributions in the two fast moving nuclei can not be described naturally in one single lc gauge . in order to treat the two nuclei symmetrically",
    "we use coulomb gauge which is the essential ingredient of our calculation .",
    "the advantage of using coulomb gauge is that the coulomb gauge propagator connected to a object with a big plus momentum component is equivalent to the @xmath12 gauge propagator .",
    "similarly for a left moving object coulomb gauge is equivalent to @xmath13 gauge @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that one can do the calculation in this mixture of gauges .",
    "after all the @xmath1 field has only transverse components and is obtained from the classical equation of motion in @xmath14 gauge @xcite",
    ". however , there are some technical subtleties behind this naive connection which will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : gauge ] .",
    "instead of trying to solve the classical field equations of the two colliding nuclei , in section [ sec : calculation ] we will use a diagrammatic approach to study color - neutral particle production in the nucleus - nucleus collisions . in order to simplify the diagrams the slavnov - taylor - ward ( stw )",
    "identities @xcite will be heavily used .",
    "the diagrammatic stw identities were used in various contexts , for example , in obtaining a non - linear gluon evolution equation @xcite , in studying the quantum structure of ww fields @xcite , and in a neutral current dis off a large nucleus @xcite .",
    "we will start with some low order examples , then illustrate how to generalize from only one nucleon in each nucleus to an arbitrary number of nucleons in each nucleus and how the contribution of all soft gluons are resummed by @xmath1 .",
    "the cross section is manifestly factorizable in the light cone calculation . in section [ sec : covariant ] we also perform a calculation in covariant gauge as a confirmation of the result we have in the lc calculation .",
    "the physical picture is slightly different in covariant gauge .",
    "a hard gluon released by a nucleus will be multiply scattered , both elastically and inelastically , by nucleons of the other nucleus as the two nuclei pass through each other .",
    "the transverse momentum distribution of the hard gluon will be gradually broadened by the multiple scattering and can be found by solving a diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "if we sum up all possible nucleons from which the hard gluon could come from in a nucleus the ww gluon distribution shows up right before the collision , however the cross section does not manifestly factorizable at first glance .",
    "this is additional evidence that the ww gluon distribution is the right type of gluon distribution for this process .",
    "moreover , comparing the calculation from these two different approaches , we believe that transverse momentum factorization can be easily achieved in light cone gauge , or more precisely in coulomb gauge .",
    "therefore light cone gauge with appropriate regularization in the propagator and the ward identities are the two essential ingredients in obtaining a transverse momentum factorized formula . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first process where an exact analytic formula has been formed for a physical process , involving momenta on the order of @xmath6 , in nucleus - nucleus collisions in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "we might hope that this method can be further applied to study more complicated processes , such as gluon production .",
    "in the lc gauge @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the yang - mills field propagator contains a singular denominator @xmath17 and must be regularized .",
    "the propagator that will be used in the following calculation takes the form @xmath18 where the momentum @xmath19 flows from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "note that , due to the opposite direction of the momentum flow , the second and the third terms in the propagator always have the opposite @xmath22 pole in the complex @xmath23-plane .",
    "this way of regularizing the propagator was previously derived in canonical quantization @xcite and in path integral formalism @xcite and more recently in a gauge transformation analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been realized that the @xmath22 prescriptions in the lc propagator are closely related to initial and final state interactions @xcite .",
    "that is the @xmath22 poles in the light cone propagator dictate how gluons propagate in the @xmath24- or @xmath25-directions when they are emitted from physical objects , like nucleons .",
    "for example , in @xmath26 gauge , the propagator ( [ eq : lightcone ] ) tells us that the gluon fields coming from a right - moving nucleon only propagate in the positive @xmath24-direction , or in terms of gauge rotation , gluons coming from a source with coordinate @xmath27 only gauge rotates other sources that satisfy @xmath28 . with gluons only propagating in one certain direction",
    "the @xmath22 prescriptions can be used to avoid initial or final state effects . in a neutral current dis off a large nucleus",
    "the regularization can be chosen such that it can eliminate final state interactions @xcite . implementing different prescriptions , one can also shift a final state interaction to an initial state interaction @xcite .",
    "however , can not be used immediately in the calculation of nucleus - nucleus collisions , because one single lc gauge choice would make the two nuclei asymmetric .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath12 gauge , then a right moving nucleus having a big plus momentum component naturally fits in with such a gauge choice .",
    "however , for a left moving nucleus it is awkward to develop gluon fields in such a gauge .",
    "the same problem arises if we want to use @xmath13 gauge .",
    "therefore one single lc gauge , either @xmath12 or @xmath13 , will make the two fast moving nuclei asymmetrical .",
    "naturally one wants to use @xmath12 gauge for the right - moving nucleus while @xmath13 gauge for the left - moving nucleus , so that gluon fields can be developed naturally in each nucleus .",
    "indeed , the gauge choice satisfying this need exists , although it is not obvious at first sight .",
    "it is the coulomb gauge @xmath29 @xcite , in which the propagator reads @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 for any vector @xmath32 .",
    "when this propagator is connected to a fast right moving object , so that @xmath33 , the dominant part in is @xmath34 which coincides with the one from the in @xmath12 gauge except for the @xmath22 pole .",
    "similarly for a left moving system coulomb gauge is equivalent to @xmath13 gauge .",
    "therefore , in coulomb gauge the gluon fields emitted from a right moving system are in @xmath12 gauge , while for a left moving system in @xmath13 gauge .",
    "however , the coulomb gauge does not indicate an explicit choice of @xmath22 s in the propagator .",
    "so if we want to choose coulomb gauge as our overall gauge choice we have to show that lc calculation is independent of the @xmath22 prescriptions in the propagator . since we will use two different lc propagators for the two colliding nuclei , there are totally four different choices of @xmath22 s but only three of them are different .",
    "different choices of @xmath22 s correspond to different ways that gluons propagate , i.e. different way of calculating diagrams . in principle",
    "we can compare diagrams coming from different @xmath22 choices order by order .",
    "up to tree level diagrams , we manage to show that three different choices of @xmath22 s give an identical result . for the problem at hand we do not need to go beyond tree level calculation , since it is sufficient to compare tree level diagrams in the quasi - classical approach .",
    "part of our goal here is quite similar to what has already been done by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they introduced a gauge invariant transverse momentum - dependent parton distribution and showed that the definition is independent of the @xmath22 prescriptions on the lc propagator and is the same as the calculation done in covariant gauge . here , however , we are not only able to show that ww gluon distribution is independent of the @xmath22 prescriptions , but also that the cross section for scalar particle production is independent of the prescriptions and factorized .",
    "in this section we evaluate scalar particle production in a nucleus - nucleus collision in light cone gauge . in light cone gauge noncausal interactions",
    "can happen . in our problem",
    "the dominant part of the lc propagator is @xmath35 $ ] , which gives rise to the noncausal interactions indicated by the @xmath36 factor from the second term of the propagator .",
    "so when we speak of the choice of @xmath37 we always refer to the second term of the propagator . other components of the lc propagator are small .",
    "for example , in @xmath38 gauge , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is small compared to @xmath41 .    in order to illustrate the calculation we take two nucleons from each nucleus as shown in , where the two nuclei are moving along the @xmath42-axis , and the dashed line represents the scalar field . as the two nuclei move towards each other at a very high energy ,",
    "they are highly contracted in the direction of their motions . however , the nucleons inside a nucleus are well - ordered in the @xmath24-direction , for the right - moving nucleus , or @xmath25-direction , for the left - moving nucleus .",
    "we choose the nucleus 1 to be a right - mover which has a big plus momentum component and is in @xmath12 gauge .",
    "we label the front nucleon in the nucleus 1 to be nucleon 1 which has a smaller @xmath24-coordinate than that of nucleon 2 , @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , nucleus 2 is a left - mover and is in @xmath13 gauge .",
    "the @xmath25-coordinate of nucleon @xmath44 is less than that of nucleon @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "we will use @xmath47 and @xmath48 choices for the propagators in @xmath12 and @xmath13 gauge respectively , which means gluon fields propagate from the front to the back in a given nucleus . in other words , gluons in @xmath12(@xmath13 ) gauge only propagate from a small @xmath24(@xmath25)-coordinate to a large @xmath24(@xmath25)-coordinate . with this very property a number of diagrams are prohibited at the beginning .",
    "a typical group of diagrams is shown in , where we only draw one gluon from each nucleon .",
    "it is straightforward to add more gluons , but no more than two gluons from each nucleon in the quasi - classical approximation .",
    "if one wants to connect gluon @xmath49 with , for example in , gluon @xmath19 , which come from nucleon 2 that has a smaller @xmath24-coordinate than that of nucleon @xmath44 , then one obtains a diagram that violates the @xmath47 prescription .",
    "such diagrams correspond to initial state interactions before the collision , they are suppressed by the mass @xmath5 in the current @xmath22 prescriptions .",
    "a more detail discussion will be given in the appendix .",
    "moreover , in the appendix we repeat the calculation in a totally different @xmath22 prescription , which leads to a huge amount of initial state interactions , then such diagrams are necessary in the calculation . in principle",
    "the current @xmath22 prescriptions would lead to severe final state interactions , however , color neutral scalar particle knows nothing about the gluon fields after the collision once produced , clearly it is not the case for gluon production .",
    "therefore the four diagrams shown in are the only diagrams we have to calculate if we allow only one gluon from each nucleon",
    ". moreover , hard gluons have to come from the last interacting nucleon in each nucleus according to the same reasons . in our approximation",
    ", we only need one hard gluon from each nucleus to make up the large mass @xmath5 , and one - hard - gluon approximation is also one of the characteristics of the ww gluon fields .    we will use the stw identities to evaluate the graphs in .",
    "first , we focus on the left part of .",

    "the dominant part of the @xmath54-propagator is proportional to @xmath55 , while the @xmath56-propagator contains @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58-poles only come from the two propagators and are on opposite sides of the real axis .",
    "we now carry out an integration over @xmath58 , the phase factor @xmath59 with @xmath60 tells us to distort the contour in the lower - half plane and pick up the pole in the @xmath54-propagator which sets @xmath61 . since @xmath62 is very small compared to @xmath63 for scalar particle production in a central rapidity region , we can replace @xmath64 by @xmath65 which allows us to apply the stw identities to the @xmath21-index .",
    "the @xmath65 factor will separate the @xmath66 vertex into two different parts @xmath67\\big\\}.\\ ] ]    the first term in multiplied by the @xmath19-propagator gives @xmath68 .",
    "however , the @xmath69 term is eliminated by the @xmath56-propagator ; i.e. @xmath70 , so only @xmath71 is left .",
    "this corresponds to eliminating the @xmath19-propagator and bringing the @xmath54-line to the gluon - scalar vertex .",
    "similarly , the second term in eliminates the @xmath56-propagator and brings the @xmath54-line back to the nucleon 2 .",
    "due to color factors the second term cancels with the graph shown in .",
    "therefore , the non - vanishing contribution comes from the first term which is denoted by a dashed line with an arrow , a notation introduced by t hooft @xcite , attaching to the scalar - gluon vertex .",
    "similar calculations can also be found in ref .",
    "the new @xmath54-line changes the momentum of the @xmath56-line to @xmath19 , so there is no @xmath54-dependence at the vertex @xmath52 .",
    "this gluon line can be interpreted as a gauge rotation which is essentially a soft gluon , or a small-@xmath0 gluon which is only coherent in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the gauge rotation brings color as well as transverse momentum but no longitudinal momentum to the vertex .",
    "we can also apply the same technique to the @xmath49-line which also becomes a gauge rotation .",
    "the sum of the four diagrams in can be greatly simplified by the stw identities and become the one diagram shown in with all the soft gluons interpreted as gauge rotations . now",
    "the vertex part in reads @xmath72\\\\    & \\approx -({\\underline{k}}-{\\underline{p}}_{1})\\cdot({\\underline{l}}-{\\underline{k}}-{\\underline{k}}_{1})l_{+}l_{- } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the transverse momentum components come from the two hard gluon propagators .",
    "we always assume that the mass squared of the scalar particle @xmath73 is larger than any transverse momentum in the system .",
    "we see that although there are two soft gluons attached to the hard gluons , only the transverse momenta of the hard lines enter the vertex , which is the very characteristic of the ww field @xmath1 in momentum space .",
    "therefore , we can identify the hard gluons from each nucleus as the ww fields at this order .",
    "this identification become even sharper by noticing that the gluon field emerging from one nucleus , either the left or right part of , is the same as the result of fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this low order calculation can be easily generalized to an arbitrary number of interacting nucleons in each nucleus .",
    "the hard gluons still come from the last interacting nucleons while all the soft gluons are propagating backwards .",
    "we always apply the stw identities to the soft gluons that come from the most front nucleons first .",
    "the soft gluons become gauge rotations and merge at the scalar - gluon vertex as shown in . adding more nucleons corresponds to attaching more gauge rotations to the hard gluons .",
    "all the gauge rotations can be resummed in coordinate space , then the hard gluons become the ww fields @xmath74 of the nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can first calculate the scattering amplitude at the lowest order where there is only one gluon from each nucleus as shown in .",

    "such diagrams give zero as required by causality in covariant gauge .     and",
    "@xmath148 are effectively put on - shell after each scattering.,width=377 ]    it is straightforward to generalize the calculation to an arbitrary number of nucleons as shown in .",
    "suppose that the hard gluons are coming from @xmath83th and @xmath148th nucleons of nucleus 1 and 2 respectively , the gluon from the @xmath83th nucleon in nucleus 1 can be scattered by the nucleons coming before the @xmath148th nucleon in nucleus 2 .",
    "similarly , the gluon which comes from the @xmath148th nucleon in nucleus 2 can be scattered by the nucleons coming before the @xmath83th nucleon in nucleus 1 .",
    "one or two gluons exchanges can happen as the gluon passes each nucleon , and after each scattering the produced gluon is put on shell by a contour distortion .",
    "we see that a hard gluons has to travel through a certain length in the nuclear matter and its transverse momentum is broadened by the multiple scattering .",
    "this process can be described by a classical diffusion equation in momentum space @xcite and the transverse momentum distribution can be found by solving this equation .",
    "the solution of gluon diffusing in nuclear matter is found in @xcite .",
    "we will use the results derived in those two papers .",
    "the unintegrated gluon distribution at the final stage of multiple scattering can be written as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the nuclear density and is assumed to be uniform throughout the nucleus , @xmath151 is the initial gluon distribution which can be taken to be @xmath152 , @xmath153 is the probability distribution for the gluon to have transverse coordinate @xmath154 at a longitudinal position @xmath42 , @xmath155 is the longitudinal position where the hard gluon finally emerges from the nuclear medium and is ready to produce the scalar particle . for the gluon from @xmath83th nucleon we can take @xmath156 . in the case of gluon @xmath157-broadening , for a spherical nucleus , @xmath153 can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath106 is the radius of the nucleus and @xmath159 is the impact parameter .",
    "since the hard gluon can come from any nucleon in the nucleus , we have to sum up all the possibilities which corresponds to the @xmath160 integration in .",
    "it gives us @xmath161 which is the ww type gluon distribution and is the same as .",
    "this one - to - one correspondence between the lc calculation and the covariant calculation is also explained in @xcite .",
    "it is now quite convincing that ww gluon distribution is the right gluon distribution that should be used for this process .",
    "it is interesting to note that in covariant gauge , as in light cone gauge , the nucleons `` behind '' the nucleon which gives the hard gluon creating the scalar particle are viewed as non - interacting , which is the very property that gives rise to the ww gluon distribution .",
    "however , in covariant gauge , the diagrams do not clearly indicate that the cross section is factorizable .",
    "the author would like to thank a.  h.  mueller for suggesting this work and many stimulating and informative discussions , as well as for reading the manuscript .",
    "partial support is provided by the u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "in this appendix , we will show how a different regularization in the lc propagator gives the same result . although there are three more cases in addition to the one discussed in the body of the paper , here we will only study the most complicated one where the gluons in the nuclei propagate in the negative @xmath24(@xmath25)-direction in @xmath12(@xmath13 ) gauge .",
    "the two remaining cases can also be shown to give the same result by applying the same technique .",
    "now the choices of @xmath22 s are taken to be @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 gauge respectively , which means that gluons in @xmath12(@xmath13 ) gauge propagate from a large @xmath24(@xmath25)-coordinate to a small @xmath24(@xmath25)-coordinate .",
    "with all the gluons propagating in this way initial state interactions are complex and entanglement between the soft gluons can occur .",
    "even nucleons belonging to different nuclei could affect each other , therefore the factorizability is not clear at the very beginning .",
    "this is quite different from what we have seen previously where there is no initial state interactions between the two nuclei .",
    "we will see that the stw identities guarantee that the cross section is still factorizable and is the same as the one obtained previously .    in light cone gauge",
    "we have the privilege to specify where the hard gluons come from , so in order to simplify the calculation we further classify the diagrams by how the hard gluons are connected to the nucleons and group them into several distinct classes .",
    "the advantage of doing so is that , on one hand , one can avoid double counting diagrams and , on the other hand , the gluons that we have to add to the diagrams should be soft so that we can apply the stw identities to them .",
    "we start with the case where the hard gluons are coming from the first nucleons on each side as shown in .",
    "there are still two more soft gluon lines that should be added to the graph . in order to avoid double counting",
    "we can fix one of the soft lines first , for example , the gluon line connecting nucleons 1 and 2 in and . then draw different connections of the second soft line so that we can apply the stw identities .",
    "if we add and together the soft gluon from nucleon @xmath45 becomes the gauge rotation shown in .",
    "then we focus on the first soft line and enumerate its possible connections , now as a dashed gauge line , while doing the same thing to the second soft gluon .",
    "we obtain another diagram shown in . adding and together",
    ", we change the soft gluon from nucleon 2 to a gauge rotation and obtain the diagram shown in .",
    "since the gauge rotation acts independently on the hard gluons , the gauge rotation from nucleon @xmath45 can also attach to the hard gluon from nucleon 1 .",
    "one obtains an additional diagram shown in .",
    "we need one more diagram , , in order to apply the stw identities .",
    "but such a diagram with a three - gluon - scalar vertex is suppressed by a power of mass squared of the scalar particle @xmath73 and can be neglected in our approximation .",
    "it is shown here only for the sake of completeness .",
    "if one add all the diagrams , , together , the stw identities guarantee that they give zero contribution . a similar argument",
    "can also be made to obtain the diagrams shown in , and , their sum is also zero .",
    "therefore the soft gluons from the last interacting nucleons do not contribute to the collisions in this specific choices of @xmath22 s .",
    "this result is what one should expect from the stw identities . since the identities tell us that if we enumerate all possible insertions of a longitudinal polarized gluon line to a certain graph their sum should be zero",
    "this is exactly what we have in this case , where the gluon fields coming from either nucleon 2 or @xmath45 , the last interacting nucleon , can gauge rotate everything that comes before them .",
    "therefore all possible connections should add up to zero .",
    "so it is not surprising that even though we might have a huge number of diagrams , gauge invariance guarantees that many of them add to give no contribution .",
    "similarly , one can also consider the case where the hard gluons are coming from nucleons 2 and @xmath44 , shown in , and , and the symmetric case , where the hard lines are coming from nucleons @xmath45 and 1 , which is not shown in the figure .",
    "since these two cases are essentially the same , it is sufficient to study only one of them . due to the stw identities ,",
    "they also give us no contribution .",
    "finally , the last case is the one where the hard lines are coming from nucleons 2 and @xmath45 .",
    "since now the soft gluons can gauge rotate only certain parts of the diagram , it should give a nonzero result .",
    "if there is an entanglement between the two soft gluons , one obtains diagrams like and .",
    "however , this kind of diagrams are suppressed by @xmath164 . since the three - gluon vertex brings in an additional factor of transverse - momentum squared , a factor of @xmath164 comes from the denominator to make up the right dimension .",
    "therefore those diagrams have small contributions in our approximation .",
    "moreover , one could also make a contour distortion explained in the appendix to make such diagrams zero . if the two soft gluons are directly connected to the hard gluons , one obtains which is the dominant contribution in this choice of @xmath22 s .",
    "one can immediately recognize that this diagram is exactly the same as the one in .",
    "in section [ sec : calculation ] we argued that the initial state interactions are suppressed by the scalar mass @xmath5 in the @xmath165 and @xmath166 gauge choice . here",
    "we will do an explicit calculation to show that it is true .",
    "we take the example mentioned in section [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "the diagram is shown in , which is quite similar to but the connection of @xmath49-line is changed .",
    "let us focus on the part of the diagram that involves the gluons from nucleus 2 , nucleons @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the relevant factors in the integrand are @xmath167\\\\    & \\times v_{\\nu\\lambda}\\frac{i}{(l - k - k_{1})^{2}+i\\epsilon}\\frac{\\bar{\\eta}_{\\sigma}(l - k - k_{1})^{\\perp}_{\\lambda}}{(l - k - k_{1})_{-}+i\\epsilon } , \\end{split } \\label{eq : suppression}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 .",
    "since the big momentum component that flows through the @xmath169-propagator is the big plus momentum component coming from nucleon 2 , it is natural to use @xmath12 gauge for the @xmath169-propagator .",
    "we can distort the contour to the upper half @xmath146-plane to pick up the @xmath170 pole . since @xmath171 and @xmath136 , then @xmath172 is large in the center of mass system of the colliding nuclei . in order to compensate for the @xmath173 and @xmath174 denominators",
    ", we would need a @xmath175 coming from the numerator , a @xmath176 cancels the two denominators and one @xmath146 is necessarily to form the large mass @xmath5 .",
    "there are only two vertices , @xmath66 and @xmath52 , that involve @xmath146",
    ". however , the @xmath52 vertex can not give a factor of @xmath146 because of @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , there is sufficient convergence in the @xmath146-plane for the contour to vanish at infinity , and such diagrams are suppressed by the mass of the scalar particle .",
    "we could arrive at an even stronger result more directly by noticing that we can replace @xmath177 by @xmath178 after the contour distortion and then use the current conservation in the @xmath179-index to obtain a zero result .",
    "however , such a diagram is not suppressed in @xmath163 choice for the propagators in @xmath13 gauge .",
    "this new @xmath22 prescription changes the second and the last factors in to @xmath180 and @xmath181 $ ] , respectively .",
    "we can still distort the contour in the upper half plane to pick up the @xmath182 pole .",
    "all the other @xmath146-poles lie on the other side of the real axis , and no suppression occurs in this situation . after the contour integration",
    ", one can replace @xmath183 by @xmath184 and then use the stw identities to simplify the diagrams .",
