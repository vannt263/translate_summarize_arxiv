    "consider a particle which moves freely inside a bounded domain ( a billiard ) and reflects elastically from the domain s boundary .",
    "we assume that the boundary of the billiard changes with time and restores its shape periodically .",
    "elastic collisions with the moving boundary cause changes in the particle kinetic energy .",
    "if the average energy gain over multiple collisions is positive , the particle accelerates .",
    "this process is often called `` fermi acceleration '' since it resembles the mechanism of cosmic particles acceleration by reflecting from magnetic mirrors proposed by fermi in 1949 @xcite . in recent years",
    "the problem has attracted a lot of attention ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "when the particle accelerates indefinitively , the motion of the boundary eventually becomes slow compared to the particle motion .",
    "so we assume that the separation of time scales is already present in the billiard . from the physical point of view , it is important that the motion of the billiard boundary is not affected by the collisions with the particle , i.e. the boundary can be considered as a wall of infinite mass .",
    "thus , the fermi acceleration can be viewed as a process of energy transfer from a slow heavy object ( in our case , the billiard boundary ) to fast light particles . in this respect ,",
    "the crucial question is whether the energy transfer is possible at all , and if so , how effective it is , i.e. what is the rate of the particle energy growth and how it distributes among an ensemble of particles .",
    "we note that there are two alternative approaches to measurements of rates for the fermi acceleration in billiards .",
    "some authors ( e.g. @xcite ) study the growth of the energy as a function of the collision number @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to see @xcite that the particle speed can grow at most linearly in @xmath0 .",
    "we prefer an alternative point of view , where the billiard is considered as a flow and we study the energy growth with time @xmath1 .",
    "when a particle accelerates the rate of collisions increases , and the resulting energy growth rate may be either polynomial or exponential @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the acceleration rates strongly depend on the shape of the billiard or , more precisely , on the dynamics of the corresponding `` frozen '' billiards . at any given moment of time",
    "@xmath1 , let us stop the slow motion of the billiard boundary .",
    "the dynamics within the frozen domain consist of free inertial motion inside the domain and elastic reflections from its static boundary .",
    "this standard billiard dynamical system is completely determined by the shape of the frozen domain .",
    "thus , one considers the family of static billiards parameterised by the frozen time @xmath1 . when all `` frozen '' billiards in this family are integrable ( e.g. have a rectangular , circular or elliptic shape ) , the papers @xcite report either no fermi acceleration or a slow one .",
    "on the other hand , if all the frozen billiards are chaotic ( e.g. sinai billiards , bunimovich stadium , etc . )",
    ", then the fermi acceleration is usually present @xcite .",
    "this statement , that chaotic frozen dynamics typically lead to acceleration , is known as the loskutov - ryabov - akinshin conjecture @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in a sense , this conjecture was proven in @xcite : exponentially accelerating trajectories exist in a billiard of periodically oscillating shape provided every static billiard in the corresponding frozen family has a non - trivial hyperbolic invariant set .",
    "the proof uses the existence of a smale horseshoe structure in the frozen billiards and , as a result , the exponentially fast energy growth is established for initial conditions from a set of lebesgue measure zero only .",
    "such orbits are difficult to observe numerically and , indeed , only power - law energy growth was reported in numerous papers ( e.g. @xcite ) . in order to model this moderate growth of the averaged energy seen in numerical experiments , a stochastic differential equation was proposed and verified numerically in @xcite . according to this model the ensemble - averaged fermi acceleration is quadratic in time ,",
    "provided all frozen billiards are ergodic and mixing .",
    "the slow pace of the acceleration is caused by the long - time preservation of the anosov - kasuga adiabatic invariant for a large set of initial conditions @xcite . in the billiard context",
    ", the anosov - kasuga invariant is equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the particle s energy , @xmath4 is the volume of the billiard and @xmath5 is the dimension of the billiard domain .",
    "for slowly oscillating ergodic billiards , the conservation of the anosov - kasuga invariant coincides with the classical thermodynamics adiabatic law for an ideal gas .",
    "in particular , the ergodic adiabatic theory predicts that @xmath6 for a large set of initial conditions if @xmath7 is the time - period of oscillations of the billiard shape . in this way",
    "the ergodic adiabatic theory prohibits fast acceleration in periodically perturbed ergodic billiards .",
    "a much faster , in fact exponential in time , ensemble - averaged fermi acceleration is possible when a fraction of the frozen billiard family has several ergodic components @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this case most initial conditions experience exponential energy growth .",
    "namely , transitions between different ergodic components of the frozen billiard family lead to a substantial increase in energy transfer to the moving particles .    in this paper",
    "we further explore the accelerating effect of the violation of ergodicity : we consider an example of a slow - fast system whose fast subsystem has a chaotic set coexisting with an elliptic island filled by invariant tori .",
    "we show that the slow changes in the billiard shape lead to transitions of the fast variables between the chaotic and the elliptic zone of the frozen system .",
    "we suggest that these transitions break the anosov - kasuga adiabatic conservation law ( which can be related to the boltzmann entropy of the system @xcite ) , cause a systematic increase of the entropy over each period of the slow oscillation , and thus lead to a steady ( exponential in time ) increase in the energy .",
    "we believe that this general principle of induced exponential acceleration should be applicable to a wide class of slow - fast hamiltonian systems whose fast subspace contains coexisting chaotic and elliptic components @xcite .",
    "the recent preprint @xcite provides analytical and numerical arguments supporting this conjecture for billiards with mixed phase space , whereas @xcite provides numerical evidence for this phenomenon in a smooth system with mixed phase space .",
    "we stress that this conjecture is of great importance as hamiltonian dynamical systems are rarely ergodic on every energy level .",
    "in fact , it is widely believed that the majority of hamiltonian systems have mixed phase space .",
    "here we provide a detailed analysis of this process for a special type of a planar billiard with periodically moving boundaries , an oscillating bunimovich mushroom . the frozen billiard shape is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mushroom ] .",
    "this shape was invented in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding billiard has a phase space that is sharply divided into a single elliptic and a single chaotic component , each one of positive measure @xcite .",
    "one can easily find explicit expressions for the volumes of the regular and chaotic components . using this data",
    "we propose analytical expressions for the energy distribution after one cycle of the billiard boundary oscillation and predict the energy growth rate .",
    "we show that provided the billiard boundary moves along a non - trivial loop in the space of the billiard parameters , a particle inside the billiard accelerates exponentially fast .",
    "essentially , we show that the process of energy growth over many cycles of boundary oscillations can be modelled by a geometrical brownian motion , where the particle energy after each cycle is multiplied by an independent random variable .",
    "we derive an expression for the expectation of the logarithm of this random factor in terms of the volumes of the chaotic and elliptic components , and show that this expectation is non - negative ( and typically strictly positive , which immediately implies the exponential energy growth ) .",
    "our numerical experiments confirm the predicted growth rate with good precision .",
    "the paper has the following structure . in section 2",
    "we study the properties of the bunimovich mushroom @xcite and find explicit expressions for the volumes of the regular and chaotic components .",
    "section 3 contains our main theoretical results .",
    "in particular , we derive an adiabatic theory in the presence of particle flux , which is used to calculate the change in the particle s energy while it stays in the chaotic or regular component .",
    "then we find the probability of capture into the regular component .",
    "finally , we calculate the averaged growth rate of energy over a period of the mushroom oscillations , and show that this rate is non - negative .",
    "moreover , it is strictly positive for generic oscillations",
    ". thus the average energy increases exponentially fast . in section 4",
    "we present several numerical experiments that confirm our prediction for the energy growth rate , probabilities of capture into the elliptic island and distributions of the energy . in section 5",
    "we summarise the work and discuss possible extensions for our theory .",
    "a bunimovich mushroom consists of a semi - disk and a stem  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : mushroom ] )",
    ". a particle moves freely inside the mushroom @xmath8 and reflects elastically from its boundary .",
    "the particle can go from the cap to the stem and back through a hole .",
    "the dynamics of the particle are defined by the hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the momentum and position of the particle . on the boundary of @xmath8 the particle velocity",
    "is reflected according to the elastic low : the incidence angle is equal to the reflection angle and the absolute value of the velocity is not changed .",
    "the phase space of the bunimovich mushroom consists of two invariant components of positive lebesgue measure : a regular component ( an elliptic island ) filled by invariant tori , and a chaotic component , which is ergodic and mixing @xcite .",
    "the regular component consists of points trapped in the mushroom cap .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the radius of the cap and the semi - width of the hole respectively ( see figure  [ fig : mushroom ]  ( left ) ) .",
    "when the particle moves inside the cap , the incidence angle @xmath14 with the semi - circular part of the boundary remains constant .",
    "so if at some collision @xmath15 the particle can not reach the hole and consequently never leaves the cap .",
    "along these trajectories the absolute value of the angular momentum , @xmath16 , is preserved , and consequently the dynamics are integrable .",
    "the chaotic component is the complement to the integrable one @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a tilted bunimovich mushroom in the domain @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 d_{\\mathrm{cap}}&= & \\bigl\\{\\;x^2+y^2\\leq r \\mbox { and } y\\geq 0\\;\\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for simplicity of presentation we assume that for positive @xmath21 the cone extends up to @xmath22 , namely , that @xmath23 . at @xmath24",
    "we obtain the original bunimovich mushroom ( which has a family of parabolic orbits formed by horizontal oscillations inside the stem , whereas at nonzero @xmath21 the family of parabolic orbits is destroyed ) .",
    "it can be shown by methods of @xcite that the tilted mushroom has , for every @xmath21 , the same property as the non - tilted one : the complement to the set of points whose orbits are forever trapped in the cap is ergodic and mixing .",
    "consider a set @xmath25 and let @xmath26 denote its area .",
    "let @xmath27 be the phase space volume of the set defined by @xmath28 and @xmath29 . obviously , the volume of all points in the phase space such that @xmath30 and @xmath29 is equal to @xmath31 , so @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath33 for the future analysis we will need to find volumes of the integrable and chaotic components . the elliptic island ( i.e. , the integrable component ) occupies only a part of the cap .",
    "let @xmath34 be the phase space volume of the elliptic island at the energy level @xmath35 .",
    "we claim that @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 indeed , consider a point @xmath39 inside the cap with a velocity vector @xmath40 .",
    "then define the angle @xmath41 by @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "the absolute value of angular momentum is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "notice that at the cap boundary the angle @xmath41 coincides with the incidence angle @xmath14 .",
    "the integrable component consists of trajectories that never cross the stem - cap boundary @xmath45 , where @xmath13 is the half width of the hole .",
    "since the angular momentum is conserved , and it is smaller than @xmath46 on this boundary , the integrable component at @xmath47 is defined by the inequalities : @xmath48 introducing @xmath49 , @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 so the volume is given by the following integral @xmath52 dividing by @xmath53 and using ( [ eq : vcap ] ) , we obtain ( [ volisl ] ) .    the chaotic component is the complement of the regular one , therefore its volume is given by @xmath54",
    "now suppose that the parameters of the mushroom change slowly with time .",
    "the speed of the particle is no longer preserved and we study the time evolution of the particle s energy .",
    "the classical adiabatic theory describes dynamics for a slowly changing integrable system @xcite , and the ergodic adiabatic theory studies the case when the system is ergodic at every energy level for every frozen moment of time  @xcite .",
    "neither of these theories is directly applicable when the phase space of the frozen system is a mixture of integrable and chaotic components as the particle can transfer from one type of motion to another one due to the changes in the system .",
    "while the particle stays in the cap , its dynamics can be described by a circular billiard of the same radius .",
    "we assume that the radius is a given smooth function of time , @xmath55 , and the centre of the circle does not move . let the particle hit the boundary at a point @xmath56 and @xmath14 be the impact angle , i.e. , the angle between the pre - collision velocity and the external normal to the boundary at the point of collision .",
    "let @xmath57 denote the component of the particle velocity parallel to the boundary , and @xmath58 be the normal component of the velocity .",
    "the elastic reflection @xmath59 from the moving boundary is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the velocity of the boundary motion ( note that the relation @xmath62 represents the standard elastic law in the coordinate frame that moves with the boundary ) .",
    "then for the outgoing angle @xmath63 we have @xmath64 and consequently @xmath65 we assume that the particle moves much faster than the boundary , i.e. @xmath66 . the particle speed after the collision is given by @xmath67 the time interval @xmath68 to the next collision is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the distance to the next collision point @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath72 , the change in the circle radius is also @xmath73 , so @xmath74 is @xmath73-close to the value it takes in the static circular billiard of radius @xmath55 , i.e. to the length of the chord that makes the angle @xmath14 to the radius .",
    "this gives us @xmath75 the new value of the radius at the moment of the next collision is @xmath76 now , by considering the triangle @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the centre of the circle , we find @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the impact angle at the collision point @xmath71 . by ( [ barph]),([rpr ] ) , we obtain @xmath81 it follows immediately that the impact angle @xmath14 stays approximately constant over time required for at least @xmath82 collisions , i.e. @xmath14 is an adiabatic invariant .",
    "since the circular billiard keeps being rotationally symmetric even when its radius oscillates , the angular momentum is preserved : @xmath83 taking into account equation ( [ eq : cbm ] ) we conclude that @xmath84 it follows immediately that the product @xmath85 stays approximately constant over time required for @xmath82 collisions . taking the square , we see that @xmath86 is an adiabatic invariant .    in terms of the billiard flow , the adiabatic invariance of the impact angle @xmath14 can be expressed as the adiabatic invariance of the angle @xmath87 defined as @xmath88 indeed , at the moments of collision @xmath87 coincides with @xmath14 , and it stays approximately constant between impacts . in the oscillating mushroom",
    "the above equations are valid for segments of trajectories located entirely inside the mushroom cap .",
    "suppose that a fast particle moves inside the non - autonomous mushroom . while the particle moves inside the mushroom cap , its dynamics follow the laws of the circular billiard but the sign of its angular momentum is reflected each time the particle hits the bottom of the cap .",
    "the hole of the mushroom cap is characterised by the dimensionless parameter @xmath89 suppose that at a moment @xmath90 the particle is exactly at the hole .",
    "then it is located at a point @xmath91 with @xmath92 and has velocity @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 be the absolute value of the adiabatic invariant defined by equation  ( [ eq : sinphi ] ) .",
    "since @xmath95 we conclude that @xmath96 .",
    "if at this moment @xmath97 , the particle enters the cap and can have multiple consecutive collisions inside the cap .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath98 is adiabatically invariant while the particle stays inside the cap .",
    "so if the function @xmath99 decreases below @xmath100 while the particle remains inside the cap , the particle can not reach the hole .",
    "so it must remain in the cap till @xmath99 returns back to @xmath100 .",
    "we see that the particle can be captured into the cap when @xmath99 decreases .",
    "if the particle is captured at @xmath101 , then it is released back into the chaotic zone around the moment @xmath102 when @xmath103 for the first time .",
    "thus , we can introduce the release function @xmath104 @xmath105 which establishes a connection between the capture and release times as @xmath106 .",
    "the classical ergodic adiabatic theory @xcite relies on the analysis of evolution of volumes in the phase space .",
    "this theory relies on two observations which can be presented in a bit oversimplified form in the following way .",
    "first , the ergodicity implies that time averages can be replaced by space averages and , consequently , the time evolution of the energy is the same for the majority of initial conditions starting on a given energy level .",
    "second , if the evolution of the energy depended on initial energy only , the dynamics would map an energy level into another energy level .",
    "since the hamiltonian flow is volume preserving , the volume under the energy level would stay constant . in a two - dimensional billiard",
    "this volume is proportional to @xmath107 , which is indeed the ergodic adiabatic invariant .",
    "if the system is not ergodic on energy levels , the dynamics may produce phase space flux between different ergodic components of the frozen system .",
    "then , the above volume preservation argument is invalid .",
    "a new paradigm is thus developed in the non - autonomous mushroom billiard the flux between the regular and chaotic zones is governed by the parameter @xmath108 defined by ( [ eq : nu ] ) . if @xmath109 , phase volume  leaks \" from the chaotic zone to the regular one , whereas @xmath110 leads to the opposite effect .",
    "we analyse this situation by considering a short time interval , @xmath111 $ ] , at which the mushroom s shape does not change noticeably , yet , the particle experiences a large number of collisions with the billiard boundary .",
    "suppose that during this time interval the radius of the hole @xmath13 has changed by @xmath112 , the length of the stem @xmath113 has changed by @xmath114 and the radius of the cap @xmath12 has changed by @xmath115 .    in this discussion",
    "we need to distinguish two cases depending on the sign of @xmath116 which determines the direction of the particle flux between the integrable and chaotic components .",
    "in particular , if @xmath117 , the particle in the integrable component can not leave the cap but the particle in the chaotic zone can be captured into the integrable component .",
    "let us consider the case of capture , @xmath118 , in more details .",
    "we conjecture that if the particle is sufficiently fast and the changes in the billiard s shape are sufficiently small then , from the statistical point of view , the distribution of the energies at @xmath119 depends only on the initial and final billiard shapes , i.e. , it depends only on the values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and is independent of the particular form of the evolution of the billiard s shape in the intermediate moments of time .",
    "now , in order to separate the process of capturing into the cap from the adiabatic evolution of the energy , we represent the change of the billiard s shape as a composition of two steps . at the first step ,",
    "we allow the mushroom to take the intermediate shape shown on figure  [ fig : mushroom ] ( right ) : we make the hole in the cap slightly narrower by inserting two straight - line segments into the hole that symmetrically extend the cup bottom line .",
    "we use the notation @xmath122 and @xmath123 to label changes of a parameter @xmath124 during the first and second of these steps respectively ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "so , over the time interval @xmath126 we get @xmath127 .",
    "the shape of the billiard at the end of stage 1 is uniquely defined by the following requirements : on stage 1 the particle energy is not changed but all possible transitions between the chaotic and integrable component take place during this step , i.e. , @xmath128 and @xmath129 . on stage 2 the particle can not move from the integrable to the chaotic component or vice versa .",
    "this condition is achieved by the requirement @xmath130 .",
    "all changes in the energy are on this step : @xmath131",
    ".    on stage 1 all walls remain static ( hence @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) except for the bottom of the cap , which extends to cover a part of the hole as shown on figure  [ fig : mushroom ] ( right ) . by the end of this stage the radius of the hole",
    "is changed by @xmath135 which is negative since we assume @xmath118 . moreover",
    ", the parameter @xmath99 takes its final value : @xmath136 the total volume of the phase space remains constant on this stage but a part of the phase volume is transferred from the chaotic to the regular component : @xmath137 the last equality is a consequence of equation ( [ volisl ] ) and the requirement @xmath134 .",
    "it is important to note that on stage  1 the energy remains constant .",
    "indeed , as the straight - line segments that are inserted into the hole slide along themselves , and the other parts of the billiard boundary do not move during the stage 1 , the normal velocity of the boundary is non - zero only at two points , the end points of these two segments .",
    "therefore , the particle energy can change only if it hits the boundary exactly at one of these points at some moment of time , but this is a probability zero event .    on stage 2 the billiard is slowly deformed from its intermediate shape to the final one in such a way that the parameter @xmath37 remains constant , @xmath138 and @xmath130 .",
    "then equation ( [ eq : dnu ] ) implies that @xmath139 attains its correct final value @xmath112 . at the same time @xmath140",
    "are changed to ensure @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "it follows that on stage 2 the particle is trapped either in the regular or in the chaotic zone and can not transfer from one component to the other due to the conservation of impact angles in the circular part .",
    "if the particle is in the regular zone , its dynamics are described by the circular billiard and its energy changes according to the adiabatic law @xmath143 as derived in section [ se : circular ] .",
    "since both @xmath3 and @xmath53 are constant on stage 1 , and we get @xmath131 , @xmath144 and , consequently , @xmath145 since the flux is absent the chaotic zone remains invariant for the non - autonomous billiard , and we assume that the standard ergodic adiabatic theory can be applied to the restriction of our dynamical system onto its invariant subset .",
    "so if the particle is inside the chaotic zone , then the absence of flux allows us to claim that @xmath146 . using equation ( [ eqdvs ] )",
    "we get @xmath147 since @xmath148 , we conclude that for particles in the chaotic zone @xmath149 where @xmath150 is given by ( [ vchs ] ) .",
    "note that in contrast with the classical ergodic adiabatic theory , the right - hand side of this equality contains an additional term which takes care of the phase volume flux from the chaotic zone .",
    "one can check that the same equations describe the evolution of the energy in the case when @xmath151 ( flux from the integrable to chaotic component ) .",
    "the equations can be derived in a similar way but stages 1 and  2 are to be swapped .      in order to describe the acceleration induced by the capture - release mechanism we consider an ensemble of non - interacting particles inside the billiard .",
    "then we can discuss the probabilities for a particle to be captured inside the mushroom cap .",
    "suppose that @xmath152 on a time interval @xmath153 $ ] so the quotient @xmath154 is decreasing .",
    "we start with @xmath155 particles with initial conditions uniformly distributed inside the chaotic zone .",
    "we assume that the distribution of the particles in the chaotic zone remains uniform for all times .",
    "let @xmath156 .",
    "we consider the transfer of particles from the chaotic zone during the time interval @xmath111 $ ] following the two - steps approximation described in the previous section . on stage 1 ,",
    "a volume of size @xmath157 is transferred from the chaotic zone to the regular component , and on stage 2 the number of particles in the chaotic zone remains unchanged .",
    "since the particles are uniformly distributed we get @xmath158 let @xmath159 be the probability of being in the chaotic zone at the time @xmath1 .",
    "on the time interval @xmath153 $ ] , the function @xmath160 satisfies the relation @xmath161 integrating equation ( [ eq : dps / ps ] ) we get @xmath162 for all @xmath163 $ ] .",
    "we stress that these equations are valid only during the period of capture when no particles are released from the elliptic zone .",
    "suppose that the parameters of the mushroom are periodic functions of time and let @xmath7 be the period . during this cycle",
    "a particle from the chaotic zone may be captured into the island when @xmath108 decreases .",
    "if the particle is captured at a time @xmath1 , then it is released at the time @xmath104 defined by ( [ trelease ] ) .",
    "note that according to this definition , if @xmath108 is increasing at some @xmath1 , then @xmath164 . we also note that @xmath165 . since all particles captured between @xmath1 and @xmath104 are released back into the chaotic zone by the time @xmath104",
    ", we also get @xmath166 for all @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that at @xmath167 the parameter @xmath108 takes its maximum , so all particles which were captured inside the chaotic zone during the cycle are releases back by the beginning of the next cycle .",
    "let us define a compression factor which describes the change in the relative size of the chaotic zone during the time of capture : @xmath168    let @xmath169 and @xmath170 $ ]",

    "consequently , @xmath173 we can rewrite this equation in the following form @xmath174 integrating over a complete cycle and taking into account that @xmath175 ( all particles are in the chaotic zone at the beginning ) we get @xmath176 the first term may be integrated by parts : @xmath177 where we grouped together contributions from capture - release pairs taking into account that @xmath178 and @xmath179 . for the second integral",

    "since @xmath165 and @xmath191 is a function of @xmath99 only , we get @xmath192 , i.e. , at the moments of capture and release , the regular zone takes the same proportion of the cap s phase space volume .",
    "we conclude that @xmath193 if and only if @xmath194 ( see ( [ eq : g]),([vchs ] ) ) .",
    "this observation can be restated in the following way .",

    "if this curve encloses a non - empty interior , the cycle is nontrivial . on the other hand ,",
    "any cycle with an empty interior is trivial .",
    "in particular , if one changes only a single parameter of the billiard , the above mechanism does not produce the exponential acceleration and we expect much slower acceleration rates .",
    "next , we assume that all particles have the same energy @xmath197 at the beginning of the billiard cycle and derive an equation for the energy distribution at the end of the cycle . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the billiard cycle contains a single interval of capture , i.e. @xmath198 is negative only on a single interval of time during one complete cycle of the billiard boundary",

    "suppose that a particle is captured at @xmath101 and let @xmath199 be its energy at the end of the cycle . in the adiabatic approximation",
    "its energy can be obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq : ds ] ) : @xmath200\\cup[t_{out},t ] } \\left ( -\\frac{dv_{cha}}{v_{cha } } -v_{cap } \\frac{d\\delta}{v_{cha } } \\right)- \\int_{t_{in}}^{t_{out } } \\frac{dv_{cap}}{v_{cap } } \\\\ & = & -\\log g(t_{in})+ \\int_{t_{out}}^{t_{in}+t}\\left ( - v_{cap } \\frac{d\\delta}{v_{cha } } \\right)\\label{eq : lne / e0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line uses the definition of the compression factor ( equation ( [ eq : g ] ) ) and the fact that @xmath201 .",
    "since the probability of capture at @xmath202 $ ] is equal to @xmath203 where @xmath160 is given by equation ( [ eq : ps ] ) , we obtain the probability distribution of the energy after the cycle in an implicit form . later in this paper",
    "we will use these implicit equations to reconstruct the distribution of the energy for specific examples of the mushroom cycles .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle is not captured over the cycle its energy is defined in the adiabatic approximation ( see ( [ eq : de ] ) ) : @xmath204 this equation implies that , if the particle stays in the chaotic zone over the whole cycle , its energy at the end of the cycle does not need to be equal to the initial energy .",
    "this conclusion is in a strong contrast with the ergodic case , where the adiabatic theory predicts that the energy returns close to its initial value at the end of a cycle .",
    "the changes in the energy are determined solely by the correction term in ( [ eq : de ] ) , which takes into account the phase flux due to the non - ergodicity of the frozen billiards .",
    "so the phase flux influences the evolution of the energy even for the particles which never cross to the regular zone .",
    "any closed curve in the space of parameters defines two billiard cycles which correspond to two different directions of motion along the curve .",
    "the values of the integrals ( [ eq : lnenc / e0 ] ) for these two cycles have the same absolute value but opposite signs .",
    "so the energy of the non - captured particles may increase or decrease after the completion of the cycle , but in both cases the energy averaged over all initial conditions increases .    in the next section we check numerically the prediction of equation ( [ eq : lnenc / e0 ] ) for several examples of billiard cycles .",
    "the theory developed in the previous sections relies upon several assumptions , which are difficult to prove analytically . in particular",
    ", we assume that the ergodic averaging theory is applicable to the chaotic component in a system which does not satisfy some of the assumptions of the original averaging theory .",
    "the most dramatic violation here is that there are transitions between the ergodic components - we propose that formula ( [ eq : de ] ) replaces the usual adiabatic law .",
    "additionally , the billiard is not a smooth system ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we also assume here that the distribution of the particle in the chaotic zone of the breathing billiard is close to the stationary uniform one .",
    "so we carry out numerical tests to check the correctness of the theoretical predictions for the energy growth rate and for the distribution of the energy after a cycle of the billiard boundary .",
    "our first example corresponds to the following protocol for the time dependence of the mushroom parameters : the radius of the gap and the length of the stem follow straight lines which connect the points @xmath205 on the plane @xmath206 while @xmath21 is fixed and @xmath207 ( see figure  [ fig : cycle ] ) .",
    "for definiteness we assume that @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the particle can be trapped inside the mushroom cap during the first stage of the process , when the hole shrinks , and then it is released during the third stage .",
    "since the radius of the cap is fixed , the particle s energy stays constant while the particle remains in the cap .     and",
    "@xmath13 are the length of the stem and its radius ( half - width ) at the cap respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=30.0%]1.5 cm   and @xmath13 are the length of the stem and its radius ( half - width ) at the cap respectively.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the processes of capture and release are determined by the width of the gap : if the particle is captured into the cap at @xmath101 then it is released at @xmath102 such that @xmath210 .",
    "so we can rewrite equations ( [ eq : erate ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) @xmath211= \\int_{w_0}^{w_1 } \\bigl(g(w)-1-\\log g(w)\\bigr ) dp_{cha}(w)\\ ] ] where @xmath212 and the volumes are defined by ( [ eq : vcap ] ) and ( [ volisl ] ) . in the derivation of the last equality we take into account",
    "that @xmath53 remains constant and @xmath213 .",
    "then @xmath214 is the probability of avoiding the capture completely .",

    "another example is obtained when we reverse the protocol ( [ eq : cycle ] ) by following the same path in the space of parameters in the clockwise direction : @xmath218 the distribution of the energy and the acceleration rate are described by the same equations but @xmath219 and @xmath220 are swapped .    in the first series of experiments we follow these two protocols by moving the billiard boundaries with piecewise constant acceleration .",

    "we propose a mechanism for achieving an averaged exponential acceleration rate for majority of initial conditions in a slowly varying system in which the fast dynamics have mixed phase space .",
    "the mechanism is examined by considering an oscillating bunimovich mushroom , where analytical predictions are derived and are corroborated numerically . in particular , after finding explicit expressions for the volumes of the regular and chaotic components , we derive analytical expressions for the energy distribution after one cycle and for the exponential energy growth rates .",
    "numerical experiments support our predictions for both the energy distribution and the growth rate , and support our claim that the violation of ergodicity is essential for getting exponential acceleration .",
    "we note that our mechanism does not require precise periodicity of the process  it only assumes that the billiard approximately restores its shape and size from time to time .",
    "our theory involves a generalisation of the ergodic adiabatic theory which takes into account the flux between different ergodic components .",
    "we show that the averaged exponential growth rate is described by the following formula @xmath271=\\int_{\\mathrm{capture } } ( g-1-\\log g ) dp_{ell}\\,.\\label{eq : m1conc_}\\ ] ] where @xmath272 denotes the compression factor for the phase volumes between the moments of capture into the elliptic island and release ( equation ( [ eq : g ] ) ) and @xmath189 denotes the probability of the particle being captured in the elliptic component .",
    "this formula is derived under quite general conditions and we hope that it may be applicable to other systems with mixed phase space",
    ".    averaged exponential acceleration is achieved when the billiard parameters change along a non - trivial loop , for which the compression factor @xmath272 of equation ( [ eq : m1conc _ ] ) is not identically one .",
    "a non - trivial loop bounds a non - empty interior when projected on a parameter plane in which one axis corresponds to the phase space volume of the chaotic zone and the other axis corresponds to the flux between the chaotic and integrable components .",
    "an important conclusion is that the exponential acceleration rate vanishes if the motion of the billiard boundary can be described by periodic oscillations of a single parameter ( as is often done in numerical simulations of fermi acceleration ) .",
    "similarly , it vanishes if one of these two ingredients  the flux between the ergodic components or the volume change of the ergodic components  is missing .",
    "when the exponential rate vanishes , we still expect to observe some slow acceleration , typically quadratic in time ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we conjecture that the described mechanism , of exponential acceleration due to interior flux and volume changes for different ergodic components of systems with mixed phase space that are adiabatically deformed , is quite general .",
    "however , in contrast with the bunimovich mushroom , in generic billiards and in generic smooth systems , the separation of the frozen fast system into ergodic components that depend continuously on parameters is more problematic .",
    "the existence of chaotic components with positive phase space volume is unknown , and the numerically observed boundary between the seemingly integrable and chaotic components is often `` sticky '' and fractal .",
    "nonetheless , we may envision that some rough estimates distinguishing the regular from the chaotic components may be derived ( e.g. by calculating lyapunov exponents ) , from which the compression rate @xmath272 and the capture probability @xmath189 may be found .",
    "then , formula ( [ eq : m1conc _ ] ) may formally connect these geometrical features of the frozen system with the energy growth rate in the adiabatically perturbed system .",
    "we should note that the influence of sticky or parabolic orbits on the statistics may be non - trivial .",
    "in fact , our initial numerical experiments with the classical bunimovich mushroom , which has a rectangular stem and thus a family of parabolic periodic orbits , showed that the energy distribution in the chaotic zone was different from the one obtained with tilted geometry .",
    "the influence of these effects when multiple slow cycles are considered is yet to be explored .",
    "while we do not anticipate that all the analytical predictions provided here may be carried over to the general case literally , we expect that the main principle , of achieving exponential acceleration by changing volumes of ergodic components on a non - trivial loop of parameters , is quite general .",
