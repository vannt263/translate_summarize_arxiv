    "hawking radiation is the remarkable property of black hole : it occurs due to creation of a particle - antiparticle pair nearby the black hole edge @xcite .",
    "if one of the pair constituents crosses the event horizon , it never returns , thus giving rise to the emission from the black hole , which in its turn leads to decreasing of black hole energy and mass ( for review see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the main difficulty in the experimental confirmation of hawking radiation is the big mass of known black holes in universe , and , hence , weak intensity of hawking radiation .",
    "that is why the reproducing of black holes in laboratory conditions are of great interest .",
    "from one side , small artificial black holes can be created in large hadron collider @xcite . from the other side ,",
    "the phenomena , originated by gravity , are reproducible ( through the similarity of wave processes ) in number of other physical systems , called analogue gravity models @xcite .",
    "in particular , black holes and hawking radiation can be obtained in electromagnetic wave waveguide @xcite , slow light in moving medium @xcite or in optical fibers @xcite ( actually , first experimental evidence of hawking radiation was observed in this system @xcite , although the nature of observed phenomena is also discussable @xcite ) , surface waves on moving water @xcite , the moving flow with a gradient from subsonic to supersonic flow ( so called acoustic or sonic black hole @xcite ) . sonic black holes , after being predicted in 1981 , later was implemented in quantum liquids like liquid he @xcite , atomic @xcite and polaritonic @xcite bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "moreover , reproducing in bec a system with inner horizon ( analogue of charged black hole @xcite ) , it is possible to achieve experimentally a black hole lasing , i.e. existence of self - amplifying hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "one of factors , which determines a practical interest to bec ( subjected to linear periodic potential  optical lattice(ol ) ] , is the possibility to use it as almost perfect testbench , which allows to reproduce ( without impurities and defects ) a lot of phenomena , known from condensed matter ( for review see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , due to strong two - body interactions bec is essentially nonlinear system : the fact , which is hardly to ignore . a natural way to take into account the nonlinearity is to consider bec matter waves in the form of localized wavepackets  solitons , which can propagate at long distances without loosing their shape .",
    "moreover , loading the bec in ol allows one to control the dispersion ( normal and anomalous ) , and , as distinct from the case without ol , allows the existence of solitons either in the case of attractive as repulsive interaction ( for review see ref.@xcite ) . besides the intensive theoretical study ,",
    "the creation of bright gap solitons in repulsively interacting bec was demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) can support vector ( multicomponent ) solitons with variety of interesting properties .",
    "the possibility for two - component bec to be loaded into ol was experimentally demonstrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "being loaded into the ol , two - component bec can sustain bright - bright and dark - bright stationary solitons @xcite , mixed - symmetry modes and breathers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , experimental study of vector solitons @xcite was restricted only to the case of dark - bright solitons in two - component bec without ol .    in the present paper",
    "we consider emission of matter wave solitons from two - component bec , loaded into parabolic trap with optical lattice .",
    "we use periodic sign - varying linear coupling term to create vector soliton , which is characterized by first- and second - component chemical potentials located in the vicinity of the lower and upper edges of the ol spectrum first band , respectively . after being loaded into the parabolic trap ,",
    "the first component of vector soliton ( characterized by positive effective mass nearby the bottom edge of first band ) oscillates periodically in the trap , while second component ( characterized by negative effective mass at top edge of the first band ) , is accelerated by parabolic trap and escapes from it . in general ,",
    "the nature of investigated phenomena is similar to hawking emission , but at the same time has significant differences .",
    "firstly , in our case the vector soliton with opposite masses of components ( analogue of particle - antiparticle pair ) is created by transferring atoms from first to second components of bec .",
    "in conventional hawking emission , by contrast , the particle - antiparticle pair is formed from vacuum due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "secondly , in our phenomenon the event horizon is defined somehow artificially ( as an edge of potential well ) .",
    "that is why we prefer to call our phenomenon _ hawking - like _ emission ( in analogy with ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we expose and describe the model of our problem ( problem statement ) . in sec.[sec : gap - sol ] we represent the stationary state of bright - bright solitons in the two - component bec and propose a mechanism to create this state . in sec.[sec :",
    "h - emis ] we describe the dynamics of two - component soliton in parabolic trap and the mechanism of hawking - like escape of the soliton from the trap .",
    "to be specific , we consider a spinor bec composed of two hyperfine states , say of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states of @xmath2rb atoms  @xcite confined at different vertical positions by transverse parabolic traps and loaded into the optical lattice of cos - like shape .",
    "additionally , a time - dependent external potential @xmath3 ( which is aperiodic in general case ) is applied to the condensate . at the same time",
    "hyperfine states are coupled by a coordinate and time - dependent coupling field @xmath4 , which describes the possibility of conversion of atoms between states ( such kind of coupling can be originated by the external magnetic field ) .",
    "we assume the condensate to be quasi - one - dimensional ( cigar - shaped ) .",
    "then , in the mean - field approximation the system is described by the gp equations  @xcite    [ eq : tc ] @xmath5    equations ( [ eq : tc ] ) are written in dimensionless form : all energy values ( like ol amplitude @xmath6 ) are measured in recoil energy units of @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the atomic mass and @xmath9 is the ol period ) , while the coordinate @xmath10 and time @xmath11 are measured in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . at the same time",
    "wavefunctions @xmath14 are measured in the @xmath15 units , where @xmath16 is the transverse [ in the @xmath17-plane ] oscillator length , @xmath18 is the inter - species s - wave scattering length [ thus , @xmath19 in ( [ eq : tc ] ) ] .    in the absence of nonlinearity",
    "( formally @xmath20 ) , additional external force @xmath21 and coupling term @xmath22 , periodicity of ol gives rise to band - gap structure of both spectrum @xmath23 and bloch functions @xmath24 of the linear problem @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the band number and @xmath27 is the bloch wavenumber in the first brillouin zone , @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "meanwhile both the spectrum and the bloch functions are periodic in the reciprocal space with period @xmath29 ( in the chosen units ) : @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "in further considerations we take into account the first band only ( @xmath32 ) , whose bottom and top correspond to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , so the index @xmath26 will be omitted .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     moreover , we can start from the situation when all the bec atoms are initially concentrated in the first component [ like eq.([eq : stsi ] ) ] , and then apply ( for the finite time ) the spatially - periodic linear coupling , which will transfer a portion of atoms to the second component .",
    "in other words , we use the same method , as described in sec.[sec : gap - sol ] , but apply it not to stationary soliton , but to the soliton oscillating inside the finite - width potential well [ see fig.[fig : smooth](c ) ] . in this case atoms , transferred to the second component , will constitute the gap soliton with negative effective mass , which in its turn will escape from the finite - width potential well , as demonstrated in fig.[fig : smooth](d ) .",
    "thus , we described a mechanism of stimulated emission of matter waves ( in form of bright solitons ) from the two - component bec , loaded into the ol , which is combined with the external parabolic potential .",
    "the similarity between the hawking emission from the black hole and the soliton escape from the parabolic trap is defined by the fact , that we use the bright - bright soliton , where chemical potentials of first and second bec component lie nearby the opposite edges of the first band of ol spectrum . as a consequence , signs of the effective masses ( which characterize the bec first and second components )",
    "are also opposite , and such type of low - amplitude soliton can be considered as an analogue of the particle - antiparticle pair in hawking emission .",
    "we demonstrated , that this low - amplitude bright - bright two - component soliton can be created by partial transferring of atoms from one to another bec component , using spatially - periodic linear coupling term , whose period equals to the double ol period .",
    "being loaded into the finite - width parabolic trap , one component of such bright - bright soliton ( characterized by the positive effective mass ) exerts periodic oscillations nearby the trap center , while another component ( with negative effective mass ) is gradually accelerated and moves in the direction of parabolic trap growth .",
    "if soliton with negative effective mass passes the finite - width parabolic trap edge ( which is the event horizon analogue ) , it escapes from the trap and never returns to the initial point .",
