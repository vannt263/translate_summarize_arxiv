    "the @xmath3cdm model is well known as the standard model of modern cosmology .",
    "it is based on the fundamental assumption called cosmological principle , which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales .",
    "the general geometric structure of the universe can be described by the spherically symmetric friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric .",
    "the @xmath3cdm model is well consistent with the seven - year wmap observations @xcite and the recent released planck 2013 results @xcite .",
    "the tiny fluctuation of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation implies that the cosmological principle is an excellent approximation @xcite .",
    "however , recent observations show that the universe may be deviated from isotropy . for example ,",
    "the large - scale bulk flow @xcite , the alignments of low multipoles in cmb angular power spectrum @xcite , the large - scale alignments of the quasar polarization vectors @xcite , the spatial variation of fine - structure constant @xcite , the cmb hemispherical asymmetry observed by wmap @xcite and planck satellite @xcite .",
    "type - ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are widely used as the standard candle to test possible anisotropy of the universe .",
    "schwarz & weinhorst @xcite used four groups of sne ia with redshift @xmath4 to test the isotropy of the hubble diagram , and found a maximal hemispheric asymmetry towards a direction close to the equatorial poles . using the hemisphere comparison method , antoniou & perivolaropoulos @xcite found that the highest expansion direction of the universe points towards @xmath5 in the union2 compilation",
    "the maximum anisotropy level is about @xmath6 . using the same method and dataset , cai & tuo @xcite found that the maximum accelerating expansion direction points to @xmath7 , and the maximum anisotropy is at the order of magnitude @xmath8 .",
    "kalus et al .",
    "@xcite tested the anisotropy of local universe using low - redshift ( @xmath4 ) sne ia calibrated from four different light curve fitters .",
    "the highest expansion rate is found to be in the direction @xmath9 is from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . in order to make the comparison easier , we convert it to the range @xmath12 $ ] . ] , and the magnitude of hubble anisotropy is about @xmath13 .",
    "zhao et al .",
    "@xcite studied the anisotropy of cosmic acceleration by dividing the union2 dataset into 12 subsets according to their positions , and found a significant dipole effect in the @xmath14-maps .",
    "the direction of this dipole is nearly perpendicular to the cmb kinematic dipole .",
    "the redshift of sne ia is usually no more than 2 . as a supplementary to sne ia , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs )",
    "are also used by some authors to test anisotropy of the universe @xcite . however , there are many controversies in calibrating grbs data .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of grbs is much larger than that of sne ia .    in the theoretical aspect",
    ", some anisotropic cosmological models have been studied @xcite .",
    "we note that the finsler - randers spacetime @xcite provides an appropriate framework for the anisotropic cosmology .",
    "the line element in finsler - randers spacetime can be described by the frw line element with an extra 1-form @xcite .",
    "this 1-form picks out a privileged axis so that the universe becomes axis - symmetric .",
    "the luminosity distance depends on not only the redshift , but also the direction .",
    "a direct fit to the union2 dataset shows that the magnitude of anisotropy is about @xmath15 , and the privileged axis points towards @xmath16 in galactic coordinate system ( gcs ) @xcite .",
    "this axis is close to the direction of highest expansion of the universe found by kalus et al .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the statistical significance of this result is too low to be conclusive .",
    "the anisotropic magnitude is small enough such that the @xmath3cdm model is still a good approximation .",
    "we can not make a convincing conclusion from only one dataset .",
    "anisotropy may come from systematic uncertainty , as well as the intrinsic property of the universe . in this paper",
    ", we use different datasets published by literatures to constrain possible anisotropy of the universe . if the privileged axes derived from different datasets are close to each other",
    ", we can safely conclude that anisotropy is an intrinsic property of the universe .",
    "otherwise , systematic uncertainty may dominate .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we briefly introduce the anisotropic cosmological model in the finsler - randers spacetime . in section [ sec : numerical ] , sne ia data calibrated from four different light curve fitters are used to constrain the model parameters .",
    "we first fit the data of each group independently .",
    "then , the intersection of four groups is picked out to fit the model .",
    "finally , we re - analyze the data by restricting the redshift to @xmath4 . in section [ sec : mcsimulation ]",
    ", monte carlo simulation is performed to rule out the selection effect .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the standard cosmological model , the spacetime is of riemann type and the line element is described by frw metric . in the finsler - randers spacetime , however , the line element can be written as the spatially flat frw line element added by an extra 1-form @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the four - dimensional spacetime coordinate .",
    "the 1-form @xmath19 on the right - hand - side of eq.([eq : randers ] ) picks out a privileged axis in the universe . for convenience ,",
    "the direction of privileged axis is denoted by @xmath20 . here and after , we take the convention that a hat over a vector denotes the unit vector along that direction .",
    "chang et al .",
    "@xcite have showed that the anisotropy of hubble diagram originates from spatial components of the privileged axis . without loss of generality ,",
    "one can choose a cartesian coordinate system ( ccs ) such that the @xmath21-axis is exactly towards the privileged direction .",
    "furthermore , assuming that the 1-form does not depend on the spacetime coordinates , then eq.([eq : randers ] ) simplifies to @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the anisotropic magnitude of the universe . and by the assumptions above , @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "the redshift @xmath21 of a supernova relates to its direction @xmath24 and time @xmath25 as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "following the similar procedure in the @xmath3cdm model @xcite , we can derive the distance - redshift relation in the finsler - randers spacetime . for a supernova locating at direction @xmath24 and redshift @xmath21 on the sky",
    ", the luminosity distance can be modified to be @xcite @xmath30 note that when we derive eq.([eq : distance - redshift ] ) , we have neglected the terms of order @xmath31 or higher . from observational considerations , the universe should not be too deviated from isotropy .",
    "thus , we have @xmath32 .",
    "when the anisotropy vanishes , i.e. , @xmath33 , eq.([eq : distance - redshift ] ) returns back to that of @xmath3cdm model .",
    "in practice , it is more convenient to transform the luminosity distance to the dimensionless distance modulus @xmath34 + 25.\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we use four groups of sne ia data published by literatures to constrain the model parameters .",
    "the data were originally published by hicken et al .",
    "they combined the cfa3 @xcite sne ia with the union set @xcite to form the so - called constitution set .",
    "the distance - redshift relation was calibrated from four different light curve fitters : mlcs17 , mlcs31 , salt and salt2 .",
    "there are 372 , 366 , 397 and 351 sne ia in each group , respectively .",
    "the intersection of four groups contains 258 sne ia .",
    "however , not all the data are suitable to be used to constrain the cosmological parameters . for example",
    ", mlcs overestimates the intrinsic luminosity of sne ia with @xmath35 , and mlcs31 overestimates @xmath36 while mlcs17 does not .",
    "hicken et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the criteria that @xmath37 & @xmath38 for mlcs17 and mlcs31 , while @xmath39 for salt and salt2 . here , @xmath36 is the host galaxy extinction parameter , @xmath40 is the shape / luminosity parameter , and @xmath41 is the color parameter . if we take the criteria into consideration , the number of sne ia in each group reduces to 324 , 298 , 309 and 265 , respectively .",
    "the intersection of four groups consists of 183 sne ia .",
    "the highest redshift of sne ia in these four groups extends to 1.55 , 1.39 , 1.37 and 1.40 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of sne ia in the sky of equatorial coordinate system ( ecs ) is plotted in figure [ fig : distrubution ] .",
    "sne ia that do not satisfy the criteria are neglected .",
    "red dots correspond to the intersection of four groups .",
    "we can see that in each group , sne ia are approximately homogeneously distributed in the sky .",
    "kalus et al .",
    "@xcite used low - redshift @xmath42 sne ia in the constitution set to test the isotropic expansion of the local universe . by comparing the best - fit hubble diagrams in pairs of hemispheres , they found that the directions of highest expansion derived from four groups differ from each other .",
    "the axes referred from mlcs17 and salt2 approximately point towards the same direction , i.e. , @xmath43 in galactic coordinate system ( gcs ) .",
    "the direction obtained from salt is @xmath44 , which is almost perpendicular to the directions obtained from mlcs17 and slat2 .",
    "the anisotropic magnitudes derived by fitting the data of four groups seem to be close to each other , with an averaged hubble anisotropy @xmath45 .",
    "this is consistent with the order of magnitude that can be expected by cosmic variance in the @xmath3cdm universe . in order to compare with our results later",
    ", we list the results of ref.@xcite in table [ tab : kalus ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : low - reshift ]",
    "a noticeable feature is that , the direction we found here approximately locates in the galactic plane .",
    "this may be caused by the selection effect , i.e. , the lack of sne detected towards the center of milky way may introduce such an asymmetry . in order to check",
    "whether the anisotropy is due to the selection effect , monte carlo simulation should be carried out .",
    "a convenient way to do so is to randomly scramble the data points in redshift and distance modulus , but to keep their positions fixed on the sky , and then reanalyze the scrambled data . repeating the procedure @xmath46 times",
    ", we can derive @xmath46 directions , as well as @xmath46 magnitudes .",
    "if a significant fraction of cases of such a monte carlo simulation show the same direction , it is high likely that the anisotropy is a selection artefact . on the contrary , if the directions derived from the simulations are uniformly distributed in the sky , the selection effect can be safely ruled out .",
    "we take the mlcs17 group as an example . after selection ,",
    "the mlcs17 group contains 324 sne . as was showed in the last section , a direct fit to the @xmath3cdm model",
    "gives the best - fit parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 km s@xmath49 mpc@xmath49 ( see table [ tab : choose - criteria ] ) .",
    "we fix ( @xmath50 ) to these values in monte carlo simulation . in each simulation , we fit the scrambled data to the anisotropic cosmological model to get the anisotropic magnitude @xmath23 and the preferred direction @xmath1 .",
    "we repeat the simulation 500 times and obtain 500 groups of best - fit parameters @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we divide @xmath53 into 10 uniformly - spaced bins and plot the histogram in figure [ fig : d_distribution ] .",
    "as can be seen , the histogram can be well fitted by the gauss function @xmath54.\\ ] ] the best - fit values and their @xmath0 uncertainties are @xmath55 the averaged magnitude of anisotropy , @xmath56 , is consistent with the results of the last section .",
    "the standard variance is @xmath57 .",
    "the directions derived in the 500 simulations are plotted in figure [ fig : lb_distribution ] .",
    "it seems that the directions are uniformly distributed in the sky .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the anisotropy is a result of selection effect .",
    "recent observations on large - scale structure of the universe imply that the cosmos may be anisotropic . as an intrinsically anisotropic geometry ,",
    "the finsler geometry provides us an ideal framework to describe the anisotropic universe .",
    "an anisotropic cosmological model was proposed in the background of the finsler - randers spacetime .",
    "an arbitrary 1-form adding to the frw line element picks out a privileged axis in the universe , such that the universe becomes axis - symmetric .",
    "giving some assumptions to the 1-form , the distance - luminosity relation was modified to be direction - dependent .",
    "sne ia data calibrated from four different light curve fitters were used to test possible anisotropy of the universe .",
    "the anisotropy constrained from four groups is found to be at the same order of magnitude , while the directions of privileged axis differ from each other .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is too large to make a convincing conclusion . picking out the intersection of four groups",
    "does not significantly improve the results .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath0 contours in the @xmath1 plane obtained from four groups overlap with each other , centering at @xmath2 .",
    "this direction is approximately in the galactic plane .",
    "monte carlo simulation excludes the selection effect .",
