    "therefore , due to the lorentz boost from the cmb rest frame into our frame , the observed radiation deviates from what would be seen in the cmb rest frame .",
    "in addition to the change of the photon energy caused by the doppler effect ( leading to the temperature dipole ) , due to light aberration the photon s apparent propagation direction is also modified under a lorentz boost ( and so are the polarization direction and plane ) .",

    "one could in principle undo the aberration effects by `` de - boosting '' the sky in real space  @xcite . in reality , however , real - space methods suffer from inaccuracies due to the resolution of the pixelization scheme and imperfect knowledge of the window function , because aberration does not preserve the shape and the area of each pixel .",

    "we show that the @xmath0 kernels are the matrix elements of a unitary boost operator , analogous of the wigner @xmath26-functions being the matrix elements of a rotation operator in harmonic space .",
    "the unitary operator lives in the hilbert space of all spin - weighted functions on the sky .",
    "it is the exponentiation of the boost generator ( valid for infinitesimal boost ) , parameterized by the rapidity parameter @xmath27 that is additive under successive boosts .",
    "using rapidity instead of @xmath8 to describe the boost is one of the new insights into the problem that allowed us to generalize previous discussions .",
    "the lorentz algebra , formed by the generators of rotation and boost in harmonic space , then leads to simple linear recursions that relate kernels of different @xmath1 , different @xmath2 and general spin weight @xmath3 .",
