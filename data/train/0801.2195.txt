    "recently , the scaling behaviors of the transverse momentum distributions for particles produced in high energy collisions attract more and more attentions .",
    "the search on the scaling behaviors of particle spectrum is significantly important for understanding the evolution of high energy heavy ion collisions and particle production mechanisms , because the produced particle distribution carries information about the dynamics of the system and is one of the most important observables in high energy collisions . in @xcite , with the experimental data from star , phenix and brahms , we found there is a scaling behavior of transverse momentum @xmath0 spectrum for pions .",
    "the scaling function is independent of the colliding system , the colliding energy , the centrality and ( pseudo)rapidity . for protons and anti - protons , there also exists a similar scaling behavior which is independent of the centrality and rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath1 @xcite . for strange particles , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ,",
    "the scaling behaviors for their distributions are under consideration .    in high energy heavy ion collisions , a lot of the initial kinetic energy of the bombarding nuclei is converted into those of the produced particles , including longitudinal and transverse ones .",
    "different from momentum , kinetic energy is a scalar and is directly associated with the temperature of the hot medium created in the collisions . for different species of particles , the same momentum corresponds to different kinetic energy because of mass effect . as well - known , the kinetic energy , rather than momentum , of particles in a thermalized system satisfies the boltzmann distribution .",
    "thus the distribution of kinetic energy of particles produced in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions is more effective in revealing the thermal properties of the system . with above consideration in mind",
    ", one can ask whether the transverse kinetic energy @xmath2 distribution has similar scaling behavior .",
    "this is our motivation of investigating the scaling properties of distributions of transverse kinetic energy @xmath2 of particles .",
    "we hope the mass effect can be suppressed in the new scaling function .    in this paper the scaling @xmath2 distribution of protons in the mid - rapidity region",
    "is studied and compared with the scaling @xmath0 distribution .",
    "it is very essential to ask why the scaling behaviors exist for different particles and what is the potential universal dynamics . in @xcite",
    "we found that the string overlap mechanism can not explain data for pion and proton simultaneously . in this paper",
    "we will consider another mechanism based on the parton percolation theory @xcite , and hope to get more information about particle production mechanism in nuclear collisions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss relation between distributions for @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and the scaling property of @xmath2 distribution of protons produced in au+au collisions at @xmath1 .",
    "universal scaling functions for pion and proton are given . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the universal scaling functions in the framework of cluster decay .",
    "the conclusion is drawn in sec .",
    "from the definition of transverse kinetic energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 mass of the particle , the invariant @xmath2 distribution is @xmath8 from the definition of @xmath2 , one can see that when @xmath9 or @xmath10 , @xmath2 is approximately equal to @xmath0 , and @xmath11 so it is feasible to only consider the scaling behavior of @xmath0 distribution in the range @xmath12 gev/@xmath13 for pions , whose mass is only @xmath14 . actually , the results obtained in @xcite are excellent .",
    "but if @xmath7 is large , as for kaons , protons and anti - protons , etc , we must consider the mass effect and investigate the scaling behaviors of @xmath2 distributions in the same range of @xmath0 .    in @xcite",
    "we have summarized the method for searching the scaling behavior of the particle s @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "now we can use the similar method to investigate the scaling behavior of the transverse energy distribution of final state particles , with transverse kinetic energy @xmath2 instead of transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "first , define a scaled variable @xmath15 and the scaled spectrum @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath3 free parameters chosen to fit the scaled distributions to the same curve .",
    "of course values of @xmath17 and @xmath3 are different for distributions at different centralities , given that for most central collisions they are set to be 1 . then @xmath18 can be regarded as a parameterization of the @xmath2 distribution in most central au+au collisions . to obtain a universal scaling function for all centralities , independent of the arbitrary in choosing values of @xmath17 and @xmath3 for the most central collisions , we introduce",
    "another scaled variable @xmath19 and the normalized scaling function @xmath20 here @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 and one can easily check that @xmath23 and @xmath24 . with above steps , one can investigate whether there exists a scaling behavior of transverse energy distribution for protons produced at mid - rapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath1 , which has a wide rang @xmath0 coverage @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ protonfd ] , all data points for different centralities can be shifted to the same curve within errorbar , and the corresponding values of parameters @xmath17 and @xmath3 shown in table i. to parameterize the curve , we define @xmath25 , and the scaling function is @xmath26 after normalization , @xmath27 with redefined @xmath28 .",

    "we showed that the @xmath2 scaling behavior can describe experimental data better than that for the @xmath0 case .",
    "although the cluster formation and decay mechanism can describe spectra of either pion or proton at different centralities , it can not give consistent description , with the same parameters in the cluster distribution , for both species of particles at the same time .",
    "thus it can be excluded as a consistent particle production mechanism .",
