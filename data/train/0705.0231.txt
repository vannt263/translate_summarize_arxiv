    "hypernuclei may be considered as a powerful  laboratory \" for unique investigations of the baryon - baryon strangeness - changing weak interactions .",
    "the field of non - mesonic weak decay has indeed experienced a phase of renewed interest in the last few years . on the one hand , different theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite indications",
    "have recently appeared in favour of a solution of the well - known and long - standing puzzle on the ratio @xmath1 @xcite between the rates for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 non - mesonic weak decay processes .",
    "nowadays , values of this neutron - to - proton ratio around 0.3 - 0.4 for @xmath4- and @xmath5-shell hypernuclei are common to both theoretical and experimental analyses .",
    "an important role in this achievement has been played by a non - trivial interpretation of data , which required analyses of two - nucleon induced decays , @xmath6 , and accurate studies of nuclear medium effects on the weak decay nucleons . on the other hand ,",
    "considerable concern is rooted in the persistence of another open problem , of more recent origin , which regards an asymmetry in the non - mesonic weak decay of polarized hypernuclei and whose solution is expected to provide new constraints for a deeper understanding of the dynamics of hypernuclear decay .",
    "new phenomenological information is in principle accessible since this asymmetry in the angular emission of protons originates from the interference among parity - conserving ( pc ) and parity - violating ( pv ) @xmath7 transitions amplitudes @xcite , while the widely considered decay widths @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the result of the incoherent sum of pc and pv amplitudes squared . while inexplicable inconsistencies appeared between the first asymmetry experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , very recent and more accurate data @xcite favour small _ observable _ asymmetries , compatible with a vanishing value , for both @xmath4- and @xmath5-shell hypernuclei . on the contrary ,",
    "theoretical models based on one - meson - exchange potentials @xcite ( generally including the pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and/or direct quark mechanisms @xcite predicted rather large and negative _ intrinsic _ asymmetry values ( from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in the above quoted studies ) .",
    "it must be noted that , on the contrary , the mentioned models have been able to account fairly well for the total non - mesonic decay rates and for the ratios @xmath1 measured for @xmath4- and @xmath5-shell hypernuclei .",
    "note also that , when discussing the comparison between theory and experiment for the asymmetric non - mesonic decay , one should distinguish ( as we have done above ) between _ intrinsic _ and _ observable _ asymmetries @xcite . due to nucleon final state interactions acting after the decay ,",
    "the former ( @xmath18 ) is of theoretical relevance only , while the real observable is the latter ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "a strong dependence of @xmath19 on final state interactions and proton detection threshold @xmath20 has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , with values of @xmath21 for standard experimental conditions ( @xmath22 mev ) of about 0.7 for @xmath23he and 0.6 for @xmath24b and @xmath25c .",
    "recently , an effective field theory approach based on tree - level pion- and kaon - exchange and leading - order contact interactions has been applied to hypernuclear decay @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of the considered four - fermion point interaction lagrangian have been fitted to reproduce the total and partial decay widths for @xmath23he , @xmath24b and @xmath25c , and the asymmetry parameter for @xmath23he . in this way , a dominating central , spin - and isospin - independent contact term has been predicted .",
    "such term turned out to be particularly important in order to reproduce a small and positive value of the intrinsic asymmetry for @xmath23he , as indicated by the recent kek experiments . in order to improve the comparison with the observed decay asymmetries in a calculation scheme based on a meson - exchange model , this result",
    "could be interpreted dynamically as the need for the introduction of a scalar - isoscalar meson - exchange .    prompted by the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite a model based on @xmath26-exchange and the direct quark mechanism has been supplemented with the exchange of the scalar - isoscalar @xmath27-meson . rather curiously , to date only a few works considered such a meson as mediator of the non - mesonic decay , despite it could in principle be relevant , being the chiral partner of the pion in qcd and given that its mass is comparable with the exchanged momenta in the @xmath28 process and with the mass of the kaon , a meson whose importance in accounting for the decay rates is , on the contrary , well established @xcite .",
    "the strategy of ref .",
    "@xcite has been to determine the weak couplings of the @xmath27 by fitting decay data for @xmath4-shell hypernuclei .",
    "the @xmath29 @xmath30 direct quark model turned out to reproduce the data for @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath19 for @xmath32he quite reasonably , while the @xmath29 model was unable to account for the experimental value of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "although the same model should also be tested for @xmath5-shell hypernuclei , the results of ref .",

    "the unknown @xmath27 couplings have been fixed to reproduce a subset of decay observables [ @xmath34 and @xmath1 for @xmath32he ] , while the remaining observables have been predicted and compared with data .",
    "the authors found that , despite the inclusion of the @xmath27 meson improved the overall agreement with experiment , the asymmetry data for @xmath32he could not be reproduced @xcite .    the contributions of uncorrelated and correlated two - pion - exchange to the non - mesonic weak decay has also been studied in refs .",
    "some preliminary papers @xcite paved the way for a model that considered , in addition to @xmath10 and @xmath14 , the exchange of two - pions correlated in the scalar - isoscalar ( @xmath35 ) and vector - isovector ( @xmath36 ) channels @xcite , with a phenomenological treatment which is quite similar to the scheme used in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrate how the correlated two - pion - exchange improves the calculation of @xmath1 over the one - pion - exchange model .",
    "after adding the exchange of the kaon , within a @xmath37 model it was found @xcite that the correlated two - pion - exchange also entails some improvement in the evaluation of the asymmetry parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a meson - exchange potential including pion , kaon , omega and uncorrelated plus correlated two - pions ( @xmath38 ) has been considered .",
    "the correlated two - pion - exchange in the scalar - isoscalar channel has been treated in terms of a chiral unitary approach which has revealed to reproduce well @xmath39 scattering data in the scalar sector and in which the @xmath27-meson appears as a dynamically generated resonance .",
    "the only free parameter of the model is the momentum cutoff that regularizes the loop integrals , which is fixed to about 1 gev in order to produce a @xmath27 resonance at the observed mass of 450 mev and having a large width .",
    "a sizable cancellation between @xmath40- and @xmath35-exchange was found for the relevant momenta ( @xmath41 mev ) in the non - mesonic decay .",

    "@xcite , in the present paper we investigate the effects on the non - mesonic decay observables for @xmath4- and @xmath5-shell hypernuclei of uncorrelated two - pion - exchange and correlated two - pion - exchange in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "we employ a finite nucleus approach and pay special attention to the proton asymmetry .",
    "the weak transition potentials for two - pion - exchange are adopted from refs .",
    "@xcite and are added to the exchange of the pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with potentials taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . correlated two - pion - exchange in the vector - isovector channel",
    "is not considered here , since the one - meson - exchange potential we use already includes the @xmath11-meson .",
    "we do not take into account the two - nucleon induced decay mode , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this channel can be safely neglected when evaluating the decay asymmetries @xcite even if its contribution to the total non - mesonic decay rate is significant . when comparing with data for this rate , the following predictions obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite should be taken into account : @xmath42 for @xmath32he and @xmath43 for @xmath24b and @xmath25c .    with the novel meson - exchange model introduced in the present paper it turns out to be possible to reproduce quite reasonably experimental data for both the decay rates ( @xmath44 and @xmath1 ) and the observable asymmetry parameter in @xmath4- and @xmath5-shell hypernuclei .",

    "the effect of the two - pion exchange contribution is larger than that found in @xcite , where this potential was built and applied to the decay of hypernuclei within a local density approximation approach .",

    "the remaining heavier mesons produce very moderate changes in the decay widths , while the asymmetry parameter , being built from interferences , shows a much stronger sensitivity .",
    "roughly speaking , the incorporation of the scalar - isoscalar terms to the ome model leaves the rates basically unaltered , while reducing substantially the absolute value of the intrinsic asymmetry in such a way that the predictions for all weak decay observables are in excellent agreement with the measured values .",
    "we note that a proper comparison with the observed asymmetries requires to account for the final state interactions of the weak decay nucleons as they go out of the residual nucleus , as done in ref .",

    "the parity  conserving amplitudes ( @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) are negative , and the parity  violating ones ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) positive .",
    "we note that the larger contributions to the asymmetry turn out to be negative and correspond to the interferences between the @xmath145 and @xmath149 ( @xmath138 ) , the @xmath147 and @xmath150 ( @xmath142 ) , and the @xmath146 and @xmath150 ( @xmath141 ) amplitudes .",
    "our two - pion scalar - isoscalar mechanism affects the parity conserving amplitudes which are diagonal in @xmath69 and @xmath151 , namely @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "as we see , they even change their sign which , in turn , transform the negative interferences @xmath138 and @xmath141 into positive contributions that largely cancel the negative @xmath142 interference .",
    "we note that the small reduction in magnitude of the @xmath140 and @xmath142 contributions to the asymmetry is just a reflection of the slight increase of the @xmath9 rate . as a consequence of the above",
    "mentioned change of sign , the asymmetry of @xmath32he turns from being large and negative in the ome model to being slightly positive in the @xmath152 plus chiral @xmath153 model , in perfect agreement with the experimental observations .    complementing the one - pion exchange mechanism in the weak decay of hypernuclei with that of two correlated pions , in the scalar ( @xmath35 ) and vector ( @xmath36 ) sectors , was considered for the first time by itonaga et al . @xcite .",
    "the model was later extended to incorporate the exchange of the @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite mesons .",
    "we should note that the approximation scheme employed in these works is purely phenomenological .",
    "their mechanism is such that , at the weak vertex , two pions are emitted via an intermediate @xmath99 or @xmath104 baryon .",
    "these two pions couple to a @xmath27 meson , which is absorbed by a nucleon at the @xmath154 strong vertex .",
    "the needed @xmath27 mass , @xmath155 , and @xmath154 coupling , @xmath156 , are taken from phenomenological fits of the strong @xmath50 interaction , while the remaining unknown @xmath157 coupling is fitted to reproduce the decay rates of @xmath5-shell hypernuclei .",
    "it is not clear whether this model includes in an effective way the uncorrelated two - pion mechanism .",
    "another phenomenological and even simpler approach to @xmath27-meson exchange is that adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the strong @xmath158 coupling constant is taken equal to that of pion , @xmath159 , and the weak @xmath160 vertex is parametrized in terms of a parity - conserving ( @xmath161 ) and parity - violating ( @xmath162 ) coupling constants that are adjusted to reproduce some weak decay observables . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this @xmath27 is added to one - pion - exchange , one - kaon - exchange and the direct quark transition induced by an effective four - quark hamiltonian . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath27 is added to a meson - exchange model which is similar to the one considered here .    in contrast , the two - pion scalar - isoscalar contributions considered in the present work are theoretically well grounded in the sense that all the coupling constants are determined from chiral meson - meson and meson - baryon lagrangians and by imposing su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the regularizing parameter is adjusted such that @xmath163 scattering data is reproduced from threshold to around a center - of - mass energy of around 1 gev , well beyond the @xmath27 region .",
    "having such different origin , it becomes difficult to perform a comparative analysis with the above phenomenolgical models .",
    "we will just point out some differences in the results .    the work of ref .",
    "@xcite found that to reproduce small and positive values of @xmath164 , as experiment indicates , their @xmath35 potential @xcite is too strong and must be decreased to half of its calculated value , hence producing an important reduction of the amplitude @xmath145 .",
    "this in turn reduces the negative @xmath138 term and the asymmetry gets dominated by their positive @xmath165 term .",
    "it becomes clear that the way of obtaining a positive asymmetry in ref .",
    "@xcite is radically different from what it is found in the present work .    the one - pion and one - kaon exchange potential of ref .",
    "@xcite are modified by a @xmath27-exchange contribution whose coupling constants are fitted to various observables in light nuclei .",
    "it is found that small values of the parity - violating coupling constant @xmath166 and a large value of the parity - conserving one @xmath167 would reproduce the measured @xmath34 and @xmath1 in @xmath32he , but the asymmetry would turn positive and large , of the order of 0.6 .",
    "another reasonable fit to the rates is found with @xmath168 , but then the asymmetry is very large and negative , close to @xmath169 .",
    "this work concludes that the additional inclusion of the direct quark mechanism permits finding a solution that reproduces both the partial rates and the asymmetry , in which case the values @xmath170 and @xmath171 are found .",
    "qualitatively similar results are found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that their @xmath27-exchange potential added to the full ome exchange model can fit @xmath34 and @xmath1 but not the asymmetry .",
    "however , their solutions are intrinsically very different , since the pv strength of the @xmath27 meson is dominant in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath172 to 20 ) while the pc and pv @xmath27 amplitudes are of comparable strength in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath173 ) . finally , we present in table  [ asyfsi ] our results for the asymmetry after incorporating the effects of final state interactions ( fsi ) on the emitted nucleons .",
    "these results are then directly comparable with the observed asymmetries .",
    "we show predictions for three hypernuclei and for the ome and ome+@xmath153 models .",
    "the first line in each case gives the asymmetry in the absence of fsi and without applying any cut on the kinetic energy of the emitted protons .",
    "the following lines incorporate the effect of fsi for different energy cuts , namely @xmath174 , 30 and 50 mev , to accommodate to the experimental conditions .",
    "a cut of @xmath175 to 50 mev is applied to @xmath32he data , while @xmath176 mev for @xmath24b and @xmath25c .",
    "we observe that , as in our ome study of ref .",
    "@xcite , the incorporation of fsi reduces the magnitude of the observable asymmetry with respect to the intrinsic asymmetry and that , as the kinetic energy cut is increased , @xmath19 tends to recover the value of @xmath18 .",
    "the results of table  [ asyfsi ] show that the ome model can not reproduce the measured values of the asymmetries , while the additional incorporation of the @xmath177 mechanism provides asymmetry results in complete agreement with the data for all hypernuclei .",
    "we have studied the non - mesonic weak decay of hypernuclei within a one - meson - exchange model supplemented with the contributions of the uncorrelated ( @xmath40 ) and correlated ( @xmath35 ) two - pion - exchange mechanisms .",
    "these last mechanisms are based on a chiral unitary model which describes @xmath163 scattering data up to around 1 gev and are taken from ref .  @xcite .",
    "our finite nucleus approach includes realistic strong correlations both in the initial and final states and considers the final state collisions of the nucleons in their way out of the residual nucleus .",
    "we have found that the two - pion - exchange mechanisms modify moderately the partial decay rates but have a tremendous influence on the asymmetry parameter , due to the change of sign of some relevant amplitudes .",
    "the one - meson - exchange plus two - pion - exchange model turns out to be able to reproduce satisfactory , not only the total and partial hypernuclear weak decay rates , but also the asymmetries observed in the angular distribution of protons emitted by polarized hypernuclei .",
    "recent studies on the validity of the @xmath178 isospin rule in the non - mesonic decay @xcite have been of large interest , especially due to their connections with the determination of @xmath1 and the asymmetry parameter .",
    "although this kind of studies should be warmly supported , here we have to note that , according to our results , based on pure @xmath179 @xmath28 transitions , there appears to be no need for the introduction of @xmath180 contributions to explain the observed non - mesonic decay rates and asymmetries .",
