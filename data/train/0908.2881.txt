    "low - dimensional quantum magnets provide a difficult challenge to the theoretical physicist because of their strong quantum fluctuations and their complex dynamics @xcite .",
    "these effects lead to rich physics that include novel quantum phases , as well as quantum phase transitions between semi - classical magnetically ordered phases and magnetically disordered quantum phases , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an interesting field of research is that of the behaviour of quantum magnetic systems in the presence of external magnetic fields , see , e.g. refs .",
    "this topic has become more important by the discovery of exotic parts of the magnetisation curve of quantum antiferromagnets , such as plateaux and jumps @xcite in the lattice magnetisation with respect to the externally applied field .",
    "indeed , the presence of these plateaux and jumps may sometimes be linked purely to quantum effects because they are not observed in equivalent classical models at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the behaviour of quantum magnetic materials in the presence of external magnetic fields is an important aspect in their subsequent technological exploitation .",
    "several methods such as quantum monte carlo method ( qmc ) , field theories , exact diagonalisation of finite systems , spin - wave techniques and strong - coupling approximation have been used @xcite to study these systems . however",
    ", each method has its own specific limitations ; for instance , the qmc is restricted ( essentially ) to unfrustrated systems because of the infamous ` sign problem . '    in this article we focus on the behaviour of quantum antiferromagnets as they react to externally imposed magnetic fields by a method of quantum many - body theory called the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) @xcite .",
    "the ccm has been used previously in order to treat a wide range of strongly interacting quantum systems . in particular , the ccm is not restricted , in principle , by the spatial dimensionality of the problem or by the presence of competition between bonds , i.e. , in frustrated quantum spin systems .",
    "a remarkable advance in the accuracy of the method for a localised approximation scheme called the lsub@xmath0 scheme has been afforded by the use of `` high - order '' ccm via computer - algebraic implementations @xcite .",
    "this computer code developed by djj farnell and j schulenburg @xcite is very flexible in terms of the range of underlying crystallographic lattice , spin quantum number , and types of hamiltonian that may be studied .",
    "furthermore , recent advances to this code now allow `` generalised expectation values '' ( with respect to one - spin and two - spin operators ) and ( separately ) excited - state properties to be evaluated to high orders of approximation .",
    "indeed , we employ the new code for the generalised expectation values to determine the lattice magnetisation and individual sublattice magnetisations of quantum antiferromagnets in external magnetic fields .",
    "the relevant hamiltonian for an antiferromagnet in an external field is defined by @xmath14 where the index @xmath15 runs over all lattice sites on the lattice .",
    "the expression @xmath16 indicates a sum over all nearest - neighbour pairs , although each pair is counted once and once only .",
    "the strength of the applied external magnetic field is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the quantum ground states at @xmath17 of all of the cases considered here are semi - classically ordered ( albeit the classical order is reduced by quantum fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "classically , nearest - neighbours align in antiparallel directions for the bipartite antiferromagnets such as the antiferromagnet on the square lattice and at angles of 120@xmath18 to each other for the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the ( tripartite ) triangular lattice at @xmath17 . in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field ( @xmath19 )",
    ", the classical picture indicates that the spins will ca nt at various angles and that at a  saturation \" value of @xmath20 ( square : @xmath21 ; triangle ; @xmath22 ) all spins align with the field .",
    "the magnetisation saturates to a maximum value @xmath23 at this point .",
    "however , we remark that the behaviour of quantum spin - half square - lattice antiferromagnet in a magnetic field @xcite is ( essentially ) the same as that of the classical model , albeit modified by quantum fluctuations .",
    "second - order ( and third - order ) spin - wave theory @xcite thus provides a good approximation to the behaviour of this model .",
    "exact diagonalisations and qmc simulations @xcite also provide good results for this case . very recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the field dependence of the low - energy descriptors of this model ( i.e. , spin stiffness , spin - wave velocity , and magnetic susceptibility ) have been investigated using exact diagonalisations and spin - wave theory .",
    "an excellent review of the properties of the spin - half square - lattice antiferromagnet is given by ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the behaviour of the quantum case for spin - half triangular - lattice antiferromagnet @xcite is much different to that of the classical model . in particular ,",
    "a magnetisation plateau is observed at @xmath24 over a finite region of @xmath8 .",
    "the range of this plateau has been estimated by spin - wave theory @xcite to be given by @xmath25 , whereas exact diagonalisations @xcite predict a region given by @xmath26 .",
    "we note that the application of the qmc method ( leading to precise results for bipartite lattices ) to the case of the triangular is severely limited by the  sign problem \" due to frustration .",
    "the available spin - wave and exact - diagonalization data for the triangular lattice seem to be less accurate and complementary results are desirable .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental evidence @xcite for the magnetic material cs@xmath27cubr@xmath28 suggests that a series of plateaux might exist at values of @xmath29 equal to 1/3 , 1/2 , 5/9 and 2/3 .",
    "the authors of this article suggest that this might be due to unit cells of differing size for the different plateaux , e.g. , each having an overall magnetisation of 1/2 , and furthermore that theory has thus far only predicted the first of these at 1/3 .",
    "however , the treatment of these possible higher plateau is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the main goal of our paper is to explain how the ccm can be used to investigate the magnetisation process of quantum antiferromagnets and to provide detailed ccm results for the spin - half heisenberg antiferromagnets on the square and the triangular lattices .",
    "the ccm has previously been applied with much success to the subject of quantum magnetic systems at zero temperature .",
    "the ccm provides accurate results even in the presence of very strong frustration .",
    "in particular , the use of computer - algebraic implementations @xcite of the ccm for quantum systems of infinite numbers of particles has been found to be very effective with respect to these spin - lattice problems . here",
    "we present a brief description of the ccm formalism and its application via computational methods to the subject of quantum spin models .",
    "we then describe the application of the method to the spin - half heisenberg model for the square and triangular lattices at zero temperature in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we present our results and then discuss the conclusions of this research .",
    "as the ccm has been discussed extensively elsewhere ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we do not consider the methodology in depth here .",
    "in particular , the interested reader should note that the use of computer - algebraic implementations has been considered in refs .",
    "however , it is still important to remark here that the exact ket and bra ground - state energy eigenvectors , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , of a general many - body system described by a hamiltonian @xmath32 , are given by @xmath33 the ket and bra states are parametrised within the ccm as follows : @xmath34 one of the most important features of the ccm is that one uses a single model or reference state @xmath35 that is normalised .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a normalisation condition for the ground - state bra and ket wave functions ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the model state is required to have the property of being a cyclic vector with respect to two well - defined abelian subalgebras of _ multi - configurational _ creation operators @xmath37 and their hermitian - adjoint destruction counterparts @xmath38 . for spin systems",
    "the model state @xmath35 typically can be chosen as an independent - spin product state and the corresponding operators @xmath37 can be expressed as a product of a set of spin lowering operators , see below and for more details also refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ccm formalism is exact in the limit of inclusion of all possible multi - spin cluster correlations within @xmath39 and @xmath40 , although this is usually impossible to achieve practically .",
    "it is therefore necessary to utilise various approximation schemes within @xmath39 and @xmath41 .",
    "here we use the localised lsub@xmath0 scheme , in which all multi - spin correlations over distinct locales on the lattice defined by @xmath0 or fewer contiguous sites are retained .",
    "this approximation scheme has been successfully applied to determine the ground - state phases of quantum spin systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the ccm is a bi - variational formulation in which the bra and ket states are parametrised separately .",
    "this means that the ket and bra states are not explicitly constrained to be hermitian conjugates . however , an advantage of this approach is that the goldstone linked - cluster theorem is obeyed and so results may be found in the infinite - lattice limit @xmath42 from the outset .",
    "the important helmann - feyman theorem is also obeyed at all levels of approximation .",
    "the ket - state and bra - state equations are obtained using the following formulae , @xmath43 { \\rm e}^s|\\phi\\rangle   & = & 0 , \\;\\ ; \\forall i \\neq 0 \\;\\ ; . \\label{bra_state_eqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the method in which eqs .",
    "( [ ket_state_eqn ] ) and ( [ bra_state_eqn ] ) are solved has been discussed extensively elsewhere @xcite .",
    "however , we remark here that the computational method for solution of the ccm problem may be broken into three parts .",
    "the first task is , namely , to enumerate the fundamental set of ccm clusters for a given level of approximation .",
    "secondly , we must determine the ket - state equations in terms of the ccm ket - state correlation coefficients by pattern - matching those clusters @xmath44 in the fundamental set to term in @xmath45 .",
    "once we have determined the ket - state equations , the bra - state equations may be determined directly .",
    "finally , we solve the coupled ccm equations for the ket- and bra - state correlation coefficients , e.g. , by using the newton - raphson method for the ket - state equations .",
    "expectation values such as the lattice magnetisation may be obtained after we have solved for both the ket and bra states .",
    "again , we refer the interested reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for more details of the practicalities of carrying out ccm calculations to high order .",
    "here we use the classical ground states of these systems of the heisenberg model in an external magnetic field as the model state .",
    "however , the magnitude of the characteristic canting angles in the quantum model ( i.e. , the angle between the local directions of the spins and the external magnetic field ) may be different from the corresponding classical value .",
    "hence , we do not choose the classical result for those angles .",
    "indeed , we consider the angles as a free parameters in the ccm calculation , which has to be determined by minimisation of the ccm ground - state energy .",
    "the ground state of the classical system at zero external field ( @xmath17 ) has nearest neighbouring spins aligning in opposite directions for the bipartite lattices ( e.g. , the square lattice ) and at angles of 120@xmath18 to each other for the triangular lattice .",
    "classically , the spins react to an external magnetic field by changing their alignment to that of the direction of the field .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ model_states ] . for the bipartite lattices , the spins thus ca nt at an angle of @xmath46 and @xmath47 to the @xmath48-axis , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ model_states]a .",
    "by contrast , for the tripartite triangular lattice and related frustrated lattices one ought to distinguish between an applied field within the plane defined by the 120@xmath18 planar state and a field perpendicular to this plane .",
    "although on the classical level both cases are energetically equivalent@xcite , thermal or quantum fluctuations favour the planar configuration @xcite . therefore in the present paper we restrict our considerations to planar states and a corresponding magnetic field applied within this plane .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we employ three different model states for the tripartite triangular lattice .",
    "the first such model state is one in which two spins on the @xmath49- and @xmath50-sublattices point generally in the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "however , they form angles @xmath51 and @xmath52 to the @xmath48-axis , as shown in the model state i of fig .",
    "[ model_states]b .",
    "the remaining spins on the @xmath53-sublattice point in a direction antiparallel to the applied external field . the second model state ii of fig .",
    "[ model_states]c for the triangular lattice has two spins on the @xmath49- and @xmath50-sublattices that align completely with the external magnetic field and the remaining spins that align antiparallel to the external magnetic field .",

    "[ model_states]d .",
    "model state ii is clearly a limiting case of both model states , i and iii .",
    "( for example , we obtain model state ii from model state iii by setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 . )    in order to simplify the problem , we now rotate the local coordinate axes in the spin space so that all spins appear notationally to point in the downwards @xmath57-direction . for a spin making an angle of @xmath46 to the @xmath48-axis , the rotation of the local axes",

    "( [ roth ] ) for those terms for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for a bond going from @xmath15 to @xmath65 has an opposite sign for those same terms for a bond going from @xmath65 to @xmath15 .",
    "this is called a `` bond directionality '' and is indicated in the above equation by the arrow in the symbol @xmath66 .",
    "an illustrative example of bond directionality in the hamiltonian for the square - lattice case is shown in fig .",
    "[ bond_directionality ] .",
    "we note also that @xmath67 runs over all @xmath49 sublattice sites , @xmath68 runs over all @xmath50-sublattice sites , and @xmath15 runs over all lattice sites .",
    "the translational symmetry of eq .",
    "( [ roth ] ) compared to the original problem has also been reduced .",
    "we must include two sites in the unit cell , as is also shown in fig .",
    "[ bond_directionality ] .",
    "similar calculations may be carried out for the triangular lattice .",
    "we have three new hamiltonians after rotation of the local spin axes of the spins for all three model states i , ii , and iii in fig .",
    "[ model_states](b - d ) for the triangular lattice case such that all spins again appear to point downwards .",

    "[ model_states](b ) , for the triangular lattice is : @xmath69 where the sum @xmath70 goes from sublattice @xmath49 to sublattice @xmath50 ( and with directionality ) .",
    "note that @xmath71 indicates a sum that goes from sublattice @xmath50 to sublattice @xmath53 and sublattice @xmath53 to sublattice @xmath49 , respectively ( and with directionality ) .",
    "a similar treatment may be carried out for the model state iii , fig .",
    "[ model_states](d ) .",
    "hence , if those spins on on the @xmath49 and @xmath50 sublattices make an angle @xmath51 to the @xmath48-axis and those spins on the @xmath53 sublattice make an angle @xmath54 to the @xmath48-axis and employing the rotation of the local spin axes of eq .",

    "we note that we have three sites in the unit cell for all of the models states used for the triangular lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "note that in addition to the model states presented above , spin liquids such as valence - bond crystal states may be treated via the ccm is by using a dimerised or plaquette ( etc . ) as relevant model state .",
    "a corresponding matrix algebra @xcite is then used with respect to this state .",
    "however , a simpler approach is now also available that relies on finding special solutions of the ccm equations for the nel - type model states used here @xcite .",
    "these allow us to treat via existing high - order formalism and computer code , for example , spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin - half one - dimensional @xmath75@xmath76 ( majumdar - ghosh ) model @xcite .",
    "the ccm is thus not restricted purely to semi - classical systems .",
    "we consider the angles as free parameters in the ccm calculation .",
    "they are determined by direct minimisation of the ccm ground - state energy .",
    "this was achieved computationally at a given level of lsub@xmath0 approximation , and a minimum ground state energy with respect to these canting angles was also found computationally for a given fixed value of @xmath8 .",
    "there was only one angle for the square - lattice antiferromagnet ( and for model state i for the triangular lattice ) and there were two such angles for model state iii for the triangular lattice .",
    "the next value of @xmath8 was then determined incrementally and the minimisation process of the energy with respect to the canting angles repeated .",
    "the fact that we had to minimise the ground - state energy with respect to such angles at each value of @xmath8 made the ccm calculations much more costly in terms of computing time required than the equivalent situations at zero external magnetic field , which requires no such minimisation .",
    "furthermore , we see that the hamiltonians of eqs .",
    "( [ roth]-[roth3 ] ) do not conserve the quantity @xmath77 , which is preserved for the square - lattice antiferromagnet at @xmath17 .",
    "for these reasons , ccm calculations in the presence of external magnetic fields are more challenging than their zero - field counterparts .",
    "a final point is that the inclusion of the ccm sub1 terms of form @xmath78 in the ground ket and bra states is also equivalent to a rotation of the local spin axes @xcite .",
    "for example , for the spin - half system , we note that @xmath79=0 and so we can prove that @xmath80 .",
    "this produces a mixture of  up \" and  down \" spins at each site , which may be thought of ( as may be seen from eq .",
    "( [ rotation ] ) above , for example ) as the same as a rotation of local spin axes .",
    "hence , we conclude that sub1 is equivalent to a rotation of the axes .",
    "previous calculations for heisenberg antiferromagnets in external magnetic fields @xcite made the explicit assumption that the correlation coefficients of the sub1 terms may be set to zero , and we make the same explicit assumption here .",
    "we minimise the ground - state energy explicitly with respect to the angles in our model state .",
    "note that we go to much higher orders of lsub@xmath0 approximation than those calculations presented in @xcite .    to investigate the magnetisation process in antiferromagnets",
    "we have to consider the total lattice magnetisation @xmath81 along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "this quantity ( in the initial coordinate frame prior to rotation of the local spin axes ) is defined by @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the spin quantum number which is @xmath84 throughout this paper ) . in the rotated coordinate frame ( and",
    "in which all of the spins point appear  mathematically \" to downwards ) , the lattice magnetisation for the bipartite lattices is now given by @xmath85 where , again , @xmath67 runs over all @xmath49 sublattice sites , @xmath68 runs over all @xmath50-sublattice sites , and @xmath15 runs over all lattice sites .",
    "we are able to determine readily the lattice magnetisation once the ket- and bra - state equations have been solved for a given value of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , similar expressions to eq .",
    "( [ rotm ] ) may be obtained for the lattice magnetisation for the triangular lattice for model states i , ii , iii , fig .  [ model_states](b)-(d ) .",
    "we note that the magnetisation found on the three sublattices may become non - equivalent in a magnetic field for the triangular - lattice case .",
    "indeed , for the triangular lattice , the expression for the lattice magnetisation aligned in the direction of the applied magnetic field on the individual sublattices ( denoted , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 ) in terms of the global axes prior to rotation of the local spin axes is given by @xmath89 where the index @xmath90 runs over all @xmath91 sites on sublattice @xmath49 , the index @xmath68 runs over all @xmath92 sites on sublattice @xmath50 , and the index @xmath93 runs over all @xmath94 sites on sublattice @xmath53 .",
    "clearly , we see that @xmath95 and that @xmath96 .",
    "now we present and discuss the results for the two models under consideration calculated by the ccm as illustrated above .",

    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion of these results .",
    "we also find that the exact result for the saturation field @xmath23 at @xmath21 is also reproduced . at this point the spins all lie in the direction of the external field .",
    "the results for the lattice magnetisation are shown in fig .",
    "[ square_magnetisation ] .",
    "there is a considerable difference between the results for the spin - half quantum model and the classical straight - line behaviour ( i.e. , @xmath97 ) . clearly , this difference is because of quantum effects .",
    "it is also obvious from fig .",
    "[ square_magnetisation ] that the magnetisation of the quantum model is below that of the classical magnetisation in the region @xmath98 .",
