    "there is much ongoing experimental effort by the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) to search for the neutral higgs boson ( @xmath11 ) of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "this model of spontaneous symmetry breaking will be tested at the lhc over all of the theoretically preferred mass range , in an experimental programme which is expected to be completed by the end of the 8 tev run of the lhc . at present @xcite",
    "there are only two regions for the mass for @xmath11 which have not been excluded at 95% c.l : i ) a region of light mass , with @xmath12 , and ii ) a region of heavy mass , @xmath13 gev",
    ".    however , this simplest model of one fundamental scalar with a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) might not be nature s choice",
    ". there could be additional scalar fields which also contribute to the masses of the fermions and weak bosons , with a more complicated scalar potential which depends on several arbitrary parameters .",
    "importantly , even in the event of no signal for a sm - like higgs boson at the lhc , the search for scalar particles should continue in earnest due to the fact that a non - minimal higgs sector can give rise to different experimental signatures , some of which are challenging to detect .",
    "consequently , it will take much longer for the lhc to probe all of the parameter space of such models .",
    "a commonly - studied extension of the higgs sector of the sm is the `` two higgs doublet model '' ( 2hdm ) , which is composed of two higgs isospin doublets @xcite ( this model has recently been reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "notably , this structure is necessary in the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the sm ( called the `` mssm '' ) .",
    "the extra higgs doublet gives rise to a particle spectrum with multiple higgs bosons ; three are electrically neutral ( two are cp - even , one is cp - odd ) and two are electrically charged ( denoted by @xmath0 ) .",
    "flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) mediated by scalars at tree level can be eliminated by requiring that the scalar interactions with the fermions are invariant under discrete symmetries ( `` natural flavour conservation '' , nfc ) @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a charged scalar @xmath0 would be unequivocal evidence of a non - minimal higgs sector , and there have been many studies of the prospects of directly observing @xmath0 from a 2hdm or the mssm at the tevatron and lhc @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) moreover , the effect of @xmath0 on the decay rates of mesons ( especially @xmath14 mesons ) also plays a major role in constraining @xmath4 and the fermionic couplings of @xmath0 @xcite,@xcite .    if @xmath15 , such particles would most copiously ( though not exclusively @xcite ) be produced in the decays of top quarks via @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "searches in this channel have been performed by the tevatron experiments , assuming the decay modes @xmath3 and @xmath2 @xcite . since",
    "no signal has been observed , constraints are obtained on the parameter space of @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 ( i.e. the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two scalar doublets ) .",
    "searches in these channels have now been carried out at the lhc : i ) for @xmath3 with 0.035 fb@xmath18 by atlas @xcite , and ii ) for @xmath2 with 4.8 fb@xmath18 by atlas @xcite and with 1 fb@xmath18 by cms @xcite .",
    "these are the first searches for @xmath0 at this collider .",
    "the constraints on @xmath16 $ ] from the lhc searches for @xmath1 are now superior to those obtained from the corresponding tevatron searches .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath0 in models with three or more higgs doublets ( called multi - higgs doublet models , mhdm ) , was first studied comprehensively in @xcite , with an emphasis on the constraints from low - energy processes ( e.g. the decays of mesons ) .",
    "although the phenomenology of @xmath0 at high - energy colliders in a mhdm and in a 2hdm has many similarities , the possibility of @xmath9 together with an enhanced branching ratio ( br ) for @xmath6 would be a distinctive feature of the mhdm .",
    "this scenario , which was first mentioned in @xcite and studied in more detail in @xcite , is of immediate interest for the ongoing searches for @xmath1 with @xmath3 by the lhc @xcite .",
    "although the current limits on @xmath3 can be applied to the decay @xmath19 ( as discussed in @xcite in the context of the tevatron searches ) , a further improvement in sensitivity to @xmath1 with @xmath19 could be obtained by tagging the @xmath10 quark which originates from @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the increase in sensitivity to br@xmath20 and to the fermionic couplings of @xmath0 in this scenario .",
    "large values of br@xmath20 are also possible in certain 2hdms , such as the `` flipped 2hdm '' with nfc @xcite . however , in this model one would expect @xmath21 due to the constraint from @xmath22 ( @xmath23 gev @xcite ) , and thus @xmath1 with @xmath19 would not proceed unless there were additional new physics beyond that of the 2hdm which contributed to @xmath22 , and weakened the constraint on @xmath4 . in the `` aligned two higgs doublet model '' ( a2hdm )",
    "@xcite there are no fcncs ( as is the case in a 2hdm with nfc ) due to an alignment of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the phenomenology of @xmath0 in the a2hdm @xcite is very similar to that of @xmath0 in a mhdm @xcite , and @xmath24 in the a2hdm is also compatible with constraints from @xmath8 . our numerical results for br(@xmath19 ) in a mhdm apply directly to the a2hdm .",
    "the 2hdm without nfc and without alignment also has a sizeable parameter space for a large br@xmath20 , and a detailed study can be found in @xcite .",
    "our work is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the fermionic interactions of @xmath0 in the mhdm / a2hdm . in section iii",
    "we quantify the parameter space for a large br@xmath25 in the mhdm / a2hdm .",
    "in section iv we summarise the tevatron / lhc searches for @xmath1 with @xmath3 and discuss how they could be optimised for @xmath6 .",
    "section v contains our numerical results , with conclusions in section vi .",
    "in a general 2hdm each fermion type ( i.e. up - type quarks , down - type quarks and charged leptons ) couples to both of the scalar doublets .",
    "this would lead to fcncs which are mediated by the neutral scalars , and the magnitude of the associated yukawa coupling is constrained by experimental data ( especially meson - antimeson mixing and the decays of mesons ) .",
    "such fcncs can be suppressed by assuming that the flavour - changing yukawa couplings are very small , which can be achieved by invoking a specific structure of the fermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to eliminate the fcncs by requiring that the lagrangian is invariant under a discrete symmetry , which is achieved if each species of fermion couples to at most one scalar doublet ( nfc ) .",
    "this condition leads to four distinct types of 2hdms which differ in their yukawa couplings .",
    "these four models are called model i , model ii , lepton - specific and flipped . and ii@xmath26 in @xcite and @xmath27 and @xmath28 in @xcite .",
    "] models i and ii have received much phenomenological attention , while the study of the lepton - specific and flipped models has been revived recently @xcite , with early studies in @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the fermionic couplings of @xmath0 in a mhdm and the a2hdm , and discuss how these couplings differ from those in the above 2hdms with nfc .",
    "a mhdm is an extension of the 2hdm with @xmath29 scalar doublets , where @xmath30 .",
    "the suppression of fcncs is obtained by imposing nfc . as in the 2hdm , the mhdm has the virtue of predicting @xmath31 at tree level , with finite higher - order corrections which depend on the mass splittings of the scalars . in the mhdm",

    "it is conventional to consider the phenomenology of the lightest @xmath0 , assuming that the other @xmath0 are heavier .",
    "one then drops the @xmath51 subscript on the couplings of the lightest @xmath0 and uses the lagrangian in eq .",

    "a particularly important constraint on the mass and couplings of @xmath0 in a 2hdm / mhdm is the decay @xmath22 @xcite , which has been measured to be in agreement with the sm prediction .",
    "it is the combination of couplings @xmath83 and @xmath84 which enters the decay rate for @xmath22 ( the contribution from @xmath85 can be neglected ) . since @xmath86 in model ii and the flipped 2hdm ( i.e. @xmath87 ) , the stringent bound @xmath88 gev at 95% c.l can be derived for all values of @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "this is due to the fact that all three vacuum expectation values @xmath97 can not be simultaneously large or small .    in our numerical analysis",

    "apart from these two differences ( which were discussed in @xcite ) , the phenomenology of @xmath0 in the democratic 3hdm and the a2hdm is essentially the same , and our numerical results will apply equally to both models . in particular , the magnitudes of @xmath27,@xmath28 and @xmath43 determine the brs of @xmath0 .",
    "in the a2hdm the extra free parameter can be taken to be a phase in the coupling @xmath28 , and such a phase does not have an effect on the brs of @xmath0 .",

    "ii , the condition @xmath9 in the flipped 2hdm would require additional new physics in order to avoid the constraint on @xmath4 from @xmath22 , while this is not the case in the mhdm .",
    "a distinctive signal of @xmath0 from a mhdm for @xmath9 would be a sizeable branching ratio for @xmath19 . for @xmath24 ,",

    "the other decays of @xmath0 to quarks are subdominant , with br(@xmath121 and br(@xmath122 ) only becomes sizeable for @xmath123 , as can be seen in the numerical analysis in @xcite in the flipped 2hdm .",

    "<S> searches for light charged higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) in the decay of top quarks , @xmath1 , are being carried out at the lhc and at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the dominant decay channels for such an @xmath0 state are either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and separate searches are performed with comparable sensitivity to the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for the decay @xmath6 can be as large as @xmath7 in the aligned two higgs doublet model and in models with three or more higgs doublets with natural flavour conservation , while satisfying the constraint from @xmath8 for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> although the current search strategy for @xmath3 is also sensitive to @xmath6 , a considerable gain in sensitivity could be obtained by tagging the @xmath10 quark from the decay @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis , which could be readily performed at the tevatron and in the 7 tev and 8 tev runs of the lhc , would probe a parameter space of the fermionic couplings of @xmath0 in the above models which at present can not be probed by experimental observables in flavour physics . </S>"
