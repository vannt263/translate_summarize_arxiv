    "the measurement and control of light produced by quantum systems have been the focus of interest of cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "specially , the emission of light powered by solid - state devices coupled to nanocavities is an extensive area of research due to its promising technological applications , such as infrared and low - threshold lasers @xcite , single and entangled photon sources @xcite , as well as various applications in quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum information @xcite .",
    "experiments with semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) embedded in microcavities have revealed a plethora of quantum effects and offer desirable properties for harnessing coherent quantum phenomena at the single photon level .",
    "for example , the purcell enhancement @xcite , photon anti - bunching @xcite , vacuum rabi splitting @xcite and strong light matter coupling @xcite . these and many others quantum phenomena are being confirmed experimentally by observing the power spectral density of the light ( psd ) emitted by quantum - dot - cavity systems ( qd - cavity ) .",
    "thus , the psd or so - called emission spectrum is the only relevant information about the system which allows to study the properties of light via measurements on correlations functions as stated by the wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite . in order to compute the absorption or emission spectrum in open quantum systems , more precisely , in qd - cavity systems different approaches",
    "have been developed from theoretical point of view .",
    "for example , the method of the thermodynamic green functions which is applied to the determination of the susceptibilities and absorption spectra of atomic systems embbeded in nanocavities @xcite , and the time - resolved photoluminescence approach whose application allows to determine the emission spectrum by consideration of an additional subsystem called the photon reservoir @xcite . however , these methods have their own approximations and restrictions and therefore are not widely used . frequently , the emission spectrum in qd - cavity systems is computed through the quantum regression theorem ( qrt ) @xcite , since it relates the evolution of mean values of observables and the two - time correlation functions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this approach can be difficult to implement in a computer program , it due to that computational complexity of qrt approach increases significantly as the number of qds or modes inside the cavity , and the dimensionalities of the hilbert spaces are large . in general , this approach is time - consuming due to that it requires to solve a large system of coupled differential equations , and numerical instabilities can arise .",
    "moreover , theoretical complications can appears related to dynamics of the operators involved , as we will point out in the next section . in spite of this",
    ", the qrt approach is widely used for theoretical works , for example , in studies of the luminescence spectra of coupled light - matter systems in microcavities in the presence of a continuous and incoherent pumping @xcite , and the relation between dynamical regimes and entanglement in qd - cavity systems @xcite . in the past ,",
    "the green s functions technique ( gft ) was successfully applied for calculation of the micromaser spectrum @xcite , as a methodology in which the two - time correlation function is treated as a green s function that decays as the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the system for a very specific initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , this approach has not been widely noticed in many significant situations in open quantum systems .",
    "possibly , it is due to their work having a limitation of implementation . the purpose of this work is to present a simple , but efficient numerical method based on qrt formalism which overcome the inherent difficulties associated to the direct application of the qrt , by solving the dynamics of the system in the frequency domain directly .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : qrt ] review the theoretical background of quantum regression theorem and its relationship with the green s functions technique .",
    "section [ sec : appl ] deal with a concrete application of our proposed method for computing the emission spectra of a dissipative qd - cavity system . in section",
    "[ results ] we show the numerical calculations of the emission of spectrum for the cavity and the quantum dot from both gft and qrt approaches .",
    "finally , we conclude in the last section .",
    "one of the most important measurements when the light excites resonantly a qd - cavity system is the emission spectrum of the system . from theoretical point of view",
    ", it is assumed that corresponds to a stationary and ergodic process which can be calculated as a psd of light using the well - known wiener - khintchine theorem @xcite .",
    "it states that the emission spectrum is given by the fourier transform of the correlation function ( two - time expectation value ) of the operator field @xmath0 , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and the normalizing factor is the population @xmath3 at the steady - state . in order to calculate the two - time expectation value",
    "is frequently used the qrt which states that if a set of operators @xmath4 satisfy the dynamical equations @xmath5 then @xmath6 is valid for any operator @xmath7 at arbitrary time @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that vality of this theorem holds whenever a closed set of operators are involved in the dynamics . in general , to obtain the closed set of operators can be difficult or an impossible task , since it must be added as many operators as necessary in order to close the dynamics of the system .",
    "for example , in order to compute the emission of spectrum in a simple model of qd - cavity system @xcite two new operadors are required due to that the field operators in the interaction picture does not lead to a complete set .",
    "before we consider the green s functions technique , we will briefly describe the calculation of the qrt in an alternate form which will be the starting point in the following section .",
    "lets consider a system operador @xmath9 which does not operate on the reservoir , then its single - time expectation value in the heisenberg picture is given by @xmath10.\\ ] ] the operator @xmath11 depics the composite density operador of the system and reservoir .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the dynamics of the system depends directly on @xmath12 for all times , but the validity of the markovian approximation requires that the state of the system is sufficiently well described by @xmath13 , therefore it is sufficient to write @xmath11 . in what follows ,",

    "then , if the @xmath18 satisfies the markovian master equation @xmath19 with @xmath20 the liouvillian superoperator , the evolution of @xmath21 can be computed by solving the dynamics of the master equation . to calculate the two - time correlation function @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are arbitrary heisenberg operators , we proceed in a similar manner ,",
    "it is , @xmath25,\\notag \\\\   & = & tr_s[\\hat{a}(t)\\hat{g}(t+\\tau)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the well - known composition and inversion properties of the evolution operator .",

    "hence , in the long - time limit the qrt reads , @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 $ ] is the green s functions operator , and the operators @xmath9 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are written in the schrdinger representation .",
    "the superscript `` ( ss ) '' refers to the steady state of the reduced density operator of the system . after taking the laplace",
    "transform on eq .",
    "( [ eq - final ] ) , we obtain an expression for the emission of spectrum in terms of the green s functions operator , it is , @xmath35.\\ ] ] prior to leaving this section , we mention that this equation will be considered for computing the emission spectrum due to the cavity as well as the quantum dot , e.g. by considering the photon and fermionic operators in a separated way .",
    "therefore , we will describe in the next subsetion a general approach that can be applied for both cases .      before to describe a simple algorithm for calculating the emission spectrum , we take into account that the dynamics for both opertors @xmath36 and @xmath37 are governed by the same master equation , i.e. , @xmath38 with @xmath20 the liouvillian superoperator , that efectivelly has a larger tensor rank than the reduced density operator of the system .",
    "so , we can write the dynamical equations for the green s functions operator in a component form : @xmath39 together with the initial condition @xmath40 . the symbol @xmath41 is a composite index for labeling the states of the reduced density operator of the system , e.g. for indexing both matter and photon states in the qd - cavity system , see section [ sec : appl ] for example .",

    "in order to apply our proposed method for calculating the emission spectrum in qd - cavity system , we will consider a simple but illustrative system composed of a quantum dot interacting with a confined mode of the electromagnetic field inside a semiconductor cavity .",
    "this quantum system is well described by the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath48 where the quantum dot is described as a fermionic system with only two possible states , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the ground and excited state , respectively . @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for the fermionic system and the cavity mode .",

    "this hamiltonian system is far away for describing any real physical situation since it is completely integrable @xcite and no measurements could be done since the light remains always inside the cavity .",
    "+ in order to include the effects of environment on the dynamics of the system , we consider the usual approach to model an open quantum system by considering a whole system - reservoir hamiltonian which is frequently splitted in three parts .",
    "the first part corresponds to the system of quantum dot - microcavity .",
    "the second part is the hamiltonian of the reservoirs and finally , the third part which is a bilinear coupling between the system and the reservoirs @xcite . after tracing out the degrees of freedom of all the reservoirs and assuming the validity of the born - markov approximation , one arrives to a master equation for the reduced density matrix of the system , @xmath60+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(2 \\hat{a } \\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}-\\hat{a}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a } \\hat{\\rho}_{s}-\\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a})\\notag\\\\&+&\\frac{\\gamma}{2}(2 \\hat{\\sigma } \\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}-\\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger } \\hat{\\sigma } \\hat{\\rho}_{s}-\\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{\\sigma})\\notag \\\\   & + & \\frac{p}{2}(2 \\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger } \\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{\\sigma}-\\hat{\\sigma } \\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger } \\hat{\\rho}_{s}-\\hat{\\rho}_{s } \\hat{\\sigma}\\hat{\\sigma}^{\\dagger}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the decay rate due to the spontaneous emission , @xmath62 is the decay rate of the cavity photons across the cavity mirrors , and @xmath63 is the rate at which the excitons are being pumped . fig .",

    "thus , light from this source couples to the cavity and a fraction of photons escapes through the partly transparent mirror from the cavity and goes to the spectrometer for measurements of the emission of spectrum .",
