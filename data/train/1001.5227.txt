    "as many questions related to time , light and causality can not be addressed in a euclidean framework , ( 2 + 1)-spacetimes of lorentzian signature are particularly relevant in this context .",
    "these spacetimes have a rich geometry , for an overview see @xcite , and realistic physical features such as initial ( big bang ) singularities and cosmological time functions .    in order to obtain interesting physics from these models",
    ", one needs to relate the variables which are used in the parametrisation of the phase space and in the quantisation of the theory to the geometry of the associated spacetime .",

    ", this implies that the holonomies acquire a non - trivial translational component that takes into account the translations and grafted strips .",
    "grafting therefore does not affect the lorentzian components of the holonomies , which determine the fuchsian group @xmath49 , but changes their translational components .",
    "for the spacetimes deformed by earthquakes , the translational components of the holonomies remain trivial , but the lorentzian components change to take into account the lorentz boosts applied to different pieces of the lightcone .",
    "the transformation of the holonomies associated with grafting and earthquakes can be determined explicitly .",
    "as the holonomies characterise the spacetime uniquely , it follows that grafting and earthquakes induce transformations on the phase space @xmath61 .",
    "these phase space transformations are given explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the deformed spacetimes obtained via the grafting and earthquake construction are given as the quotients of the deformed domains by the action of the fundamental group via the holonomies @xmath38 . in the case of a grafted spacetime",
    ", one finds that the resulting spacetimes are no longer conformally static , but show a non - trivial evolution with the cosmological time as indicated in figure [ grtimevol ] . while the constant cosmological time surfaces of a conformally static spacetime are all copies of the same riemann surface @xmath75 , rescaled by the cosmological time , this is no longer true for the grafted spacetimes .",
    "although the part outside the grafted strips is rescaled with the cosmological time , the width of the grafted strips remains constant .",
    "this implies that the impact of grafting is maximal near the initial singularity and vanishes in the limit @xmath76 as shown in figure [ grtimevol ] .",
    "the grafting construction thus maps the conformally static spacetime associated with a cocompact fuchsian group @xmath49 to an evolving spacetime associated with @xmath49 , which approaches the conformally static spacetime in the limit @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , the earthquake preserves the constant cosmological time surfaces and affects only the lorentzian component of the holonomies .",
    "it maps a conformally static spacetime associated with a fuchsian group @xmath49 to a conformally static spacetime associated with a non - equivalent fuchsian group @xmath78 .",
    "as the fundamental diffeomorphism invariant observables of the theory which characterise the geometry of the spacetimes and parametrise the phase space @xmath61 , the wilson loop observables play an important role in quantisation .",
    "this makes it natural to investigate the geometrical interpretation of the mass and spin observables .",
    "it also raises the question how the phase space transformations that are generated by these observables via the poisson bracket affect the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "@xcite let @xmath79 be a a conformally static vacuum spacetime of genus @xmath32 and @xmath66 a closed , simple geodesic on a constant cosmological time surface @xmath52 with associated weight @xmath69 .",
    "then the two fundamental wilson loop observables , the mass @xmath63 and spin @xmath64 , associated to @xmath66 generate via the poisson bracket the phase space transformations @xmath80 associated with geometry change through grafting and earthquake along @xmath66 @xmath81    this theorem confirms that the wilson loop observables which are fundamental in the quantisation of the theory also play a distinguished role with respect to spacetime geometry : they generate via the poisson bracket the two fundamental transformations which change the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "in particular , this implies that the grafting and earthquake transformations are poisson isomorphisms ( canonical transformations )",
    ".    it also provides one with a clear physical interpretation of the two fundamental wilson loop observables which justifies the names  mass \" and  spin \" .",
    "the mass observable generates grafting , the spin observable earthquakes , which can be viewed , respectively , as a translation and a rotation associated with a geodesic . in analogy with classical mechanics , where momenta generate translations and angular momenta rotations , the mass and spin observable can thus be interpreted as a momentum and an angular momentum of a geodesic .",
    "although the geometry of lorentzian vacuum ( 2 + 1)-spacetimes is well - understood , it has been difficult to obtain interesting physics from the theory .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is not readily apparent how the variables which parametrise the phase space , holonomies and wilson loops , could be measured by an observer in the spacetime .",
    "moreover , it is not obvious what physically meaningful measurement an observer could make in an empty spacetime and how such measurements would allow him to distinguish the different spacetimes that are all locally isometric to minkowski space .",
    "this problem is addressed in @xcite , where it is shown that an observer can determine the geometry of such spacetimes by sending out lightrays which return to him at a later time .",
    "the observer can then measure the return time , the eigentime elapsed between the emission of the lightray and its return",
    ". he can determine into which directions the light needs to be sent in order to return , and he can compare the frequencies of the emitted and returning lightray .    to obtain explicit expressions for these measurements in terms of the holonomy variables , it is advantageous to work in the universal cover @xmath82 .",
    "we start by explaining how the relevant concepts ( observers , lightrays , returning lightrays ) are implemented in this description . by definition",
    ", an observer in free fall in @xmath17 is characterised by a timelike , future oriented geodesic @xmath83 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath27-equivalence class of timelike , future directed geodesics in the universal cover @xmath21 .",
    "this equivalence class of geodesics is obtained by taking one lift @xmath84 of @xmath42 to @xmath21 and constructing its images @xmath85 , @xmath41 under the holonomies as shown in figure [ cover ] .",
    "a lightray is characterised by lightlike geodesic in @xmath17 or , equivalently , the @xmath27-equivalence class of lightlike , future oriented geodesics in @xmath21 obtained by taking one lift and acting on it with the holonomies .",
    "a returning lightray with respect to an observer with wordline @xmath83 is a lightray in @xmath17 that intersects the worldline of the observer twice . in the universal cover",
    ", such a returning lightray can be described as the @xmath27-equivalence class of a lightlike geodesic @xmath82 that starts at one lift @xmath86 of the observer s worldline and ends at one if its images @xmath85 , @xmath41 , as shown in figure [ cover ] .",
    "as the universal cover @xmath21 is a region in minkowski space , the lifts of the observer s wordline and of lightrays are straight lines in minkowski space with , respectively , timelike and lightlike tangent vectors .",
    "the return time @xmath87 is then obtained by parametrising the observer s worldline @xmath83 and its lifts @xmath84 according to eigentime and determining the unique positive solution of the quadratic equation @xmath88 returning lightrays are thus in one - to - one correspondence with elements of @xmath27 . the directions into which the returning lightray associated with an element @xmath41 is emitted and from which it returns are given by the projection of the lightlike vector @xmath89 on the orthogonal complement of , respectively , the tangent vector @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the relative frequencies of the emitted and returning lightray can be determined in analogy to the relativistic doppler effect .",
    "one obtains @xmath92 using these definitions , one can derive explicit expressions for the return time , the directions and the relative frequency shift @xcite .",
    "@xcite[retlr ] let @xmath86 be the lift of the worldline of an observer in free fall in @xmath17 , parametrised according to eigentime : @xmath93 consider the returning lightray associated with an element @xmath41 that is emitted by the observer at eigentime @xmath94 and returns to him at @xmath95 .",
    "then the return time @xmath87 is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the direction into which the lightray is emitted is given by the spacelike unit vector @xmath99 and the relative frequency @xmath100 of the lightray at its emission and return are given by @xmath101    the physical interpretation of these measurements is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that for an observer in a conformally static spacetime whose eigentime coincides with the cosmological time , the relative frequencies and the directions of emission do not vary with time and the return time is a linear function of the emission time .",
    "this is the case for a general observer in a general spacetime in the limit where the emission time @xmath94 and hence the cosmological time @xmath55 tend to infinity . in this limit",
    "the effect of grafting becomes negligible and the grafted spacetime approaches the associated conformally static spacetime .",
    "the measurements in theorem [ retlr ] thus allow an observer to draw conclusions about the geometry of the underlying spacetime .",
    "this raises the question if an observer can use them to determine the _ full _ geometry of the spacetime in _",

    ": can an observer determine the holonomies @xmath62 for a set of generators of the fundamental group @xmath27 up to conjugation in finite eigentime based on such measurements ?",
    "it is shown in @xcite that this is indeed possible . by considering an observer who emits light in all directions at a given time and measures the return time and return direction for each returning lightray",
