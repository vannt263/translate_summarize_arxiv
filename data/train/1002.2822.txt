    "predicting the stable structures of alloys from their constituents is a major challenge of current materials research @xcite .",
    "the traditional approach to this problem is to extract trends from systems for which experimental data is available and apply them to uncharacterized systems @xcite .",
    "these rules usually depend on simple parameters , e.g.  atomic number , atomic radius , electronegativity , ionization energy , melting temperature or enthalpy , etc .",
    "several well - known methods include the hume - rothery rules @xcite , the miedema formation enthalpy method @xcite , the zunger pseudo - potential radii maps @xcite and pettifor maps @xcite .",
    "these methods produce results largely consistent with existing experimental data and have helped direct a few successful searches for unobserved compounds @xcite .",
    "however , they offer a limited response to the challenge of identifying new compounds because they rely on the existence of consistent and reliable information for systems spanning most of the relevant parameter space . in many cases",
    ", reliable information is missing in a large portion of the parameter space ",
    "less than 50% of the binary systems have been satisfactorily characterized @xcite .",
    "this leaves considerable gaps in the empirical structure maps and reduces their predictive ability .",
    "high - throughput ( ht ) calculations of material properties based on density functional theory ( dft ) have been developed for theoretically guided material discovery and design @xcite . in this approach",
    "the phase stability landscape of alloys is explored by calculating the formation enthalpies of a large number of possible structures , identifying the minima at various component concentrations .",
    "a minimum - free - energy convex hull is constructed from these minimum energy structures .",
    "these calculations give insights into trends in alloy properties and indicate possible existence of hitherto unobserved compounds .",
    "recent advancements in this method , by efficiently covering extensive lists of candidate structure types @xcite , make it possible to complement sparse experimental data with _ ab initio _ total energy assessments .",
    "this development was envisioned by pettifor a few years ago @xcite and here we present its first realization for binary metallic systems .",
    "we apply the ht approach to a comprehensive screening of the 105 intermetallic binary systems of the hcp metals .",
    "these systems have been generally less extensively studied than the cubic ( fcc and bcc ) metals , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the experimental data is particularly sparse for a large group ( 46 ) of binary intermetallics believed to be phase separating ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "_ ab initio _",
    "calculations on these systems are scarce compared to bcc and fcc systems . cluster expansion @xcite studies of hcp systems @xcite are also relatively rare compared to cubic systems , probably due to the inherent additional computational difficulties in dealing with a lattice having a basis of symmetrically identical atoms ( a general cluster expansion code for arbitrary parent lattices was not available until 2002 @xcite ) .",
    "computations of low temperature stability of the hcp metallic binary systems were carried out using the ht framework aflow @xcite and _ ab initio _ calculations of the energies with the vasp software @xcite with projector augmented waves ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite and the exchange - correlation functionals parameterized by perdew , burke and ernzerhof for the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the energies were calculated at zero temperature and pressure , with spin polarization and without zero - point motion or lattice vibrations .",
    "all crystal structures were fully relaxed ( cell volume and shape and the basis atom coordinates inside the cell ) . numerical convergence to about 1 mev / atom was ensured by a high energy cutoff ( 30% higher than the maximum cutoff of both potentials ) and dense 6000 * k*-point monkhorst - pack meshes @xcite .    for each system , we calculated the energies of the reported crystal structures @xcite and approximately additional structures in the aflow database @xcite .",
    "these include the 176 configurations described in @xcite , all the symmetrically - distinct hcp- , bcc- , fcc - based superstructures @xcite with up to four atoms per cell , and the prototypes a5 , a6 , a7 , a8 , a9 , a11 , b20 , c36 , d5@xmath0 , al@xmath1zr@xmath2 , al@xmath3zr@xmath1 , bihf@xmath4 @xcite , cdti , cupt@xmath5 , cu@xmath3ti@xmath1 , ga@xmath1hf , ga@xmath2ni , ga@xmath3pt@xmath6 , ga@xmath2ti@xmath6 , hf@xmath3sc@xmath7 @xcite , hf@xmath6sc@xmath7 @xcite , hf@xmath6pb@xmath7 @xcite , hfpd@xmath8 @xcite , hf@xmath1tl@xmath7 @xcite , hg@xmath1pt , itl , inth , lib - ms1/2 @xcite , moti@xmath7 @xcite , mo@xmath3ti@xmath7 @xcite nbni@xmath9 , niti@xmath1 , setl and v@xmath2zn@xmath6 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the probability of reproducing the correct ground - state , if well defined and not ambiguous , is @xmath10 ( _ `` reliability of the method '' _ , eq .",
    "there is no guarantee that the true ground states of a system will be found among the common experimentally observed structures or among small - unit - cell derivative structures .",
    "however , even if it is impossible to rule out the existence of an unexpected ground - state , this protocol ( searching many enumerated derivative structures and exhaustively exploring experimentally reported structures ) is expected to give a reasonable balance between high - throughput speed and scientific accuracy to determine miscibility ( or lack thereof ) in these alloys .",
    "circles denote agreement of the empirical data and ht calculations on a database of @xmath11 structures , for phase separating ( light gray ) and compound - forming ( dark gray ) systems .",
    "squares denote ht prediction of stable ordered structures in systems reported as phase - separating ( green , red or mixed for hcp , non - hcp or both types of predicted structures , respectively ) . ]",
    "of the 105 hcp - hcp metallic binary systems , 46 were previously reported as phase - separating @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that 18 of those are actually compound - forming at low - temperatures .",
    "most of the predicted compounds are _ not _ hcp - derived structures .",
    "these results are summarized in figure [ fig1 ] , where all the hcp metals are ordered according to pettifor s chemical scale @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the symbols in each intersecting cell indicate the phase - separating or compound - forming nature of the binary alloys .",
    "circles denote cases in which the ht calculation results match the experimental data for phase separating ( light gray ) and compound - forming ( dark gray ) systems .",
    "alloys where discrepancies are found , i.e. alloys reported as phase - separating but predicted to have stable ordered structures , are denoted by squares , green - if the predicted structures are hcp - derived , or red - if they are not hcp - based .",
    "squares with both colors indicate a prediction of both types of ground - states in the same system .",
    "no reverse discrepancies were found , i.e.  no cases were found where systems reported to be compound forming were predicted to be phase separating at low temperatures .",
    "most of the 46 reported phase - separating systems are grouped in this map into three clusters .",
    "10 systems in the upper left corner , 6 in the lower right corner and 23 in a large cluster in the center .",
    "the last metal in the map , thallium , has 10 phase separating systems , 7 of which stand out of these three clusters .",
    "the _ ab initio _ results predict 4 compound - forming systems grouped in the center of the upper left cluster , which is reduced to just 6 systems .",
    "the central cluster is also reduced to just 12 systems . in particular , mg - zr and hf - mg , which form an extended branch of this cluster are predicted to be compound forming .",
    "the new smaller cluster is thus better localized in the chemical scale space .",
    "alternative mendeleev number assignments are sometimes suggested ( e.g. , see ref .  ) .",
    "one such suggestion places mg and be adjacent to each other before sc and y. the map in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] indicates that the ordering according to the pettifor @xmath12 scale locates them more appropriately at the lower part of the scale .",
    "a few of these alternative arrangements also place sc before y , whereas our calculations indicate that the @xmath12 scale is again more appropriate , since it groups together the predicted compound - forming systems in the upper left cluster .",
    "two isolated phase - separating systems , sc - tl and hf - tl , are predicted to be compound - forming , so it now seems that tl should be more appropriately placed between cd and zn .",
    "the calculation results thus complement the empirical pettifor map and group all the phase - separating systems into three small well - defined clusters .",
    "figures [ fig2][fig4 ] show the resultant structure maps @xmath13 for the binary ab , ab@xmath1 and ab@xmath3 compounds .",
    "the ordered structures are represented by their _",
    "strukturbericht _ designation or prototype .",
    "a circle indicates agreement of the empirical data and the ht calculations .",
    "cases of disagreement are indicated by rectangles .",
    "the upper and lower entries in each cell give the empirical data and the ht result , respectively . in cases where two different structures are reported in the literature or found degenerate in the calculations , both are indicated as upper or lower entries .",
    "a dash ( - ) indicates the absence of a stable structure .",
    "unidentified suspected structures are denoted by a question mark ( ? ) .",
    "some of the predicted phases ( marked by an asterisk * ) have structures for which no prototype is known and no _ strukturbericht _ designation have been given .",
    "these new prototypes are described in table [ table_protos ] .",
    "systems reported as phase - separating but predicted by our ht results to be compound forming are highlighted in red . in systems reported to be compound - forming , discrepancies between observed and calculated structures are highlighted in blue . in these cases ,",
    "the energy difference between the structures or between the reported structure ( unstable in the calculation ) and the two - phase tie - line is indicated in square parentheses .",
    "most of the predicted compounds in the ab map are concentrated in a large cluster at the center , in the largest gap of the empirical map .",
    "seven of them form a new cluster of b19 structures .",
    "three mg compounds of the cdti prototype neighbor the reported group of cd compounds with the same structure .",
    "the main feature of the empirical ab map is a large cluster of b2 compounds .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations largely preserve this cluster and the separation between it and the adjacent group of cdti compounds .",
    "discrepancies between reported and predicted structures appear mostly at the margins of these clusters .",
    "for example , the mgsc compound , reported as b2 , is predicted to switch to the adjacent cdti cluster at low temperatures .",
    "an unidentified tczr compound ( denoted by a question mark ) is predicted to belong to the b2 group and an unreported mgru compound is predicted to belong to the cdti cluster .",
    "most of the energy differences between reported and predicted structures are small .",
    "relatively large differences are found for cozr and cohf , where the reported b2 structure is predicted to be replaced by degenerate b33/tli structures , and for reti , where an unreported prototype , moti @xcite , is predicted to replace b2 at low temperatures .",
    "the structure map of the ab@xmath1 compounds is shown in figure [ fig3 ] . in this map",
    "there are eight predicted structures in reported phase - separating systems .",
    "five of them appear in the sc - zr , hf - zr , hf - ti , hf - tl and be - zn systems for which there are none in the ab map ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the main features of the empirical map are maintained , which are a large cluster of c14 compounds and a smaller c15 group bordering it in the lower left part and a small cuzr@xmath1 group on the upper left .",
    "discrepancies between reported and calculated structures appear at the margins of these clusters .",
    "in addition , small groups of c49 and c37 compounds are predicted in the upper part .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the structure map for the ab@xmath3 compounds .",
    "predicted structures appear in the hf - sc and re - tc systems , for which there are none in the ab and ab@xmath1 maps ( figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , all the systems reported as phase - separating but predicted to be compound - forming have ordered structures in at least one of these three maps .",
    "in addition , a large cluster of 13 structures is predicted in the non compound - forming gap in the center of the map .",
    "eight of these are d0@xmath0 structures and two have a closely related new hcp - prototype re@xmath3ru ( and osre@xmath3 ) .",
    "there are no major features in the ab@xmath3 empirical map except a small group of d0@xmath14 y - compounds in the upper part .",
    "this group is reproduced and extended in the calculations .",
    "the reported prototype cd@xmath3er , of cd@xmath3y , is found to be degenerate with the d0@xmath0 structure",
    ".    also predicted is a cluster of hf and ti - compounds of the unreported prototype mo@xmath3ti @xcite .",
    "this concentration of distorted bcc structures ( mo@xmath3ti is an oi8 distortion of a bcc superlattice , table [ table_protos ] ) in six hf and ti binary systems may reflect their strong affinity to bcc environments . at zero temperature ,",
    "bcc - ti is dynamically unstable having an imaginary frequency phonon branch at the n point @xcite , but it stabilizes at 882@xmath15c , where ti undergoes a hcp - bcc transition @xcite .",
    "hence , an introduction of an alloying agent that stabilizes this phonon branch , can push the ti alloy into a bcc - type environment even at low temperature .",
    "hf also undergoes an hcp - bcc transition at a much higher temperature of 1743@xmath15c , @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that alloying elements such as os , re and mo reduce this transition temperature and increase the stability domain of the bcc - phase @xcite .",
    "the calculations show that a few alloying agents may be able to drive this extension down to very low temperatures .",
    "empirical structure maps employ correlations between simple properties of the elements ( e.g.  position in the periodic table ) and known crystal types to predict stable ordered structures of new alloys .",
    "in contrast , _ ab initio _",
    "methods do not use previously available data but try to determine structure by computing from scratch a quantum mechanical description of the system .",
    "the structure maps presented above merge the results of the empirical pettifor maps and ht _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the ht results reveal unsuspected clusters of structures both in binary systems known to be compound forming and in the empty gaps in the empirical maps , that are due to lack of experimental information .",
    "it is thus demonstrated that this integration of the two different approaches produces enhanced maps that should provide a more comprehensive improved foundation for rational materials design .",
