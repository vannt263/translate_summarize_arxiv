    "diffusion - weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( dw - mri ) involves magnetic resonance techniques for non - invasively measuring local water diffusion inside tissue .",
    "local water diffusion profiles reflect underlying biological fiber structure of the imaged area .",
    "for instance in the brain , diffusion is less constrained parallel to nerve fibers than perpendicular to them . in this way",
    ", the measurement of water diffusion gives information about the fiber structures present , which allows extraction of clinical information from these scans .",
    "the diffusion of water molecules in tissue over time is described by a transition density that reflects the probability density of finding a water molecule at time @xmath6 at position @xmath7 given that it started at @xmath7 at time @xmath8 . here",
    "the family of random variables @xmath9 ( stochastic process ) with joint state space @xmath10 reflects the distribution of water molecules over time .",
    "the function @xmath11 can be directly related to mri signal attenuation of diffusion - weighted image sequences , so can be estimated given enough measurements .",
    "the exact methods to do this are described by e.g. alexander @xcite .",
    "diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , introduced by basser et al .",
    "@xcite , assumes that @xmath11 can be described for each position @xmath7 by an anisotropic gaussian function .",
    "so @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a tensor field of positive definite symmetric tensors on @xmath14 . in a dti - visualization one plots",
    "the surfaces @xmath15 where @xmath16 is fixed and @xmath17 with @xmath18 some compact subset of @xmath14 . from now on we refer to these ellipsoidal surfaces as dti - glyphs .",
    "the drawback of this anisotropic gaussian approximation in dti is the limited angular resolution of the corresponding probability density @xmath19 on positions and orientations @xmath20 and thereby unprocessed dti is not capable of representing crossing , kissing or diverging fibers , cf . @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution diffusion imaging ( hardi ) is another recent magnetic resonance imaging technique for imaging water diffusion processes in fibrous tissues such as brain white matter and muscles .",
    "hardi provides for each position in @xmath10 and for each orientation an mri signal attenuation profile , which can be related to the local diffusivity of water molecules in the corresponding direction .",
    "typically , in hardi modeling the fourier transform of the estimated transition densities is considered at a fixed characteristic radius ( generally known as the _ @xmath21-value _ ) , @xcite . as a result ,",
    "hardi images are distributions @xmath22 over positions and orientations , which are often normalized per position .",
    "hardi is not restricted to functions on the 2-sphere induced by a quadratic form and is capable of reflecting crossing information , see figure  [ fig:1 ] , where we visualize hardi by glyph visualization as defined below .",

    "promising research has been done on constructing diffusion / regularization processes on the 2-sphere defined at each spatial locus separately @xcite as an essential pre - processing step for robust fiber tracking . in these approaches position and orientation space are decoupled , and diffusion is only performed over the angular part , disregarding spatial context .",
    "consequently , these methods are inadequate for spatial denoising and enhancement , and tend to fail precisely at the interesting locations where fibres cross or bifurcate .",
    "in contrast to previous work on diffusion of dw - mri @xcite , we consider both the spatial and the orientational part to be included in the _ domain _ , so a hardi dataset is considered as a function @xmath27 . furthermore , we explicitly employ the proper underlying group structure , that naturally arises by embedding the coupled space of positions and orientations @xmath28 as the quotient of left cosets , into the group @xmath29 of 3d - rigid motions .",
    "the relevance of group theory in dti / hardi ( dw - mri ) imaging has also been stressed in promising and well - founded recent works @xcite .",
    "however these works rely on bi - invariant riemannian metrics on compact groups ( such as @xmath30 ) and in our case the group @xmath1 is neither compact nor does it permit a bi - invariant metric @xcite .    throughout this article we use the following identification between the dw - mri data @xmath31 and functions",
