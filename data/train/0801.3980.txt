    "this paper addresses some questions about poincar complexes , mainly in order to answer analogous questions about smooth manifolds .",
    "we begin by informally explaining the questions .",
    "let @xmath0 be the space of smooth embeddings of @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a submanifold of @xmath2 then by a general - position argument one sees readily that the inclusion map @xmath4 is @xmath5-connected , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the dimensions .",
    "we are after multirelative generalizations of this relative connectivity result .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are disjoint submanifolds of @xmath2 then there is the triad @xmath11 of spaces of embeddings , and we can ask about the vanishing of low - dimensional triad homotopy groups . in other words , we can look at the square diagram @xmath12\\ar[d ] & e(p , n - q_2 ) \\ar[d]\\\\ e(p , n - q_1 ) \\ar[r ] & e(p , n)\\ } \\ ] ] and ask if there is a range , depending only on the dimensions @xmath13 , in which it is a homotopy pullback square . more generally for disjoint submanifolds @xmath14 there is the @xmath15-ad @xmath16 with its associated @xmath17-dimensional cubical diagram , formed by the spaces @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the union of the @xmath20 for @xmath21 . call a cubical diagram of spaces @xmath22-cartesian if the canonical map from the first space to the homotopy limit of the rest of the diagram is @xmath22-connected .",
    "the expected statement is that the cube just described is @xmath23 ( we prefer the language of cubical diagrams to that of @xmath15-ads , except for concessions to tradition in the case of manifold or poincar duality @xmath15-ads . in the case of an @xmath17-cube arising from an @xmath15-ad , @xmath22-cartesian  basically means that the homotopy groups of the @xmath15-ad vanish through dimension @xmath24 , plus some @xmath25 information .",
    "see appendix b or @xcite . )",
    "while the case @xmath26 can be settled by simple dimension - counting , sharp results in the general case require more elaborate methods .",
    "our strategy , which succeeds whenever the codimensions @xmath27 and @xmath28 are all at least three , is briefly this :    * * step one ( homotopy ) . *",
    "solve an analogous problem with manifolds replaced by poincar complexes . *",
    "* step two ( surgery ) . * pass from poincar embeddings to block embeddings using a version of the browder - casson - sullivan - wall theorem . *",
    "* step three ( pseudoisotopy ) . *",
    "pass from block embeddings to genuine embeddings using the multirelative generalization of morlet s disjunction lemma in @xcite .",
    "step one is carried out in the present paper . steps two and three will appear in @xcite .    before turning to the details , here are a few remarks .",
    "first , as to what this kind of multirelative connectivity statement is good for : it is used in applications of functor calculus to embedding problems , for example , to establish convergence of weiss taylor tower @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "second , in many cases the number @xmath29 is negative , so that the statement has no content . in applications",
    "one compensates for small codimension by choosing @xmath17 to be large .",
    "third , weaker statements can be proved with a good deal less work .",
    "for example , the square displayed above can be shown to be @xmath30-cartesian ( as opposed to @xmath31 ) by an argument involving dimension - counting plus the blakers - massey triad connectivity theorem .",
    "this is explained in detail and generalized to any number of @xmath20 in appendix b , [ weak ] .",
    "let us now go into a little more detail about definitions and hypotheses .",
    "we choose to work with embeddings fixed along the boundary of the ambient manifold .",
    "let @xmath1 be a manifold triad .",
    "thus it has a boundary which is the union of two parts , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , meeting at a corner set @xmath34 .",
    "( any of these sets might be empty or disconnected . ) an embedding @xmath35 of @xmath32 in @xmath36 is fixed in advance .",
    "a point in @xmath0 is an embedding @xmath37 of @xmath1 in @xmath2 that extends @xmath35 and that is transverse to @xmath36 at each point of @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 below ) .",
    "note that , although @xmath35 will rarely be mentioned explicitly , @xmath0 depends on @xmath35 .     in @xmath2 .",
    "the lighter region indicates the complement . ]    to avoid side issues related to normal bundles and their poincar analogues , we prefer to work in codimension - zero settings as much as possible .",
    "the numbers @xmath7 and @xmath39 in the statements below may be thought of informally as the dimensions of spines of @xmath1 and @xmath20 .",
    "the precise assumption ( in the manifold case ) is that @xmath1 has _",
    "handle dimension _ @xmath40 relative to @xmath41 in the sense that @xmath1 can be built up from a collar @xmath42 by attaching handles of index at most @xmath7 .",
    "the most important case to think of , apart from the case when @xmath1 is @xmath7-dimensional , is the case when @xmath1 is an @xmath43-disk bundle over a @xmath7-dimensional manifold and @xmath41 is the restriction of the bundle to the boundary , or to part of the boundary .",
    "the same considerations apply to @xmath20 , @xmath44 , and @xmath39 .",
    "the main statement that we are after is conjecture [ conj1 ] below .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth compact @xmath6-dimensional manifold .",
    "let @xmath14 , @xmath45 , be pairwise disjoint compact submanifolds of @xmath2 transverse to @xmath36 and let @xmath39 be the handle dimension of @xmath20 relative to @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be a compact manifold triad and let @xmath7 be the handle dimension of @xmath1 relative to @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that an embedding @xmath49 is given , disjoint from @xmath44 for all @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath51 let @xmath52 .",
    "[ conj1 ] in this situation the @xmath17-dimensional cubical diagram formed by the spaces @xmath53 is @xmath54-cartesian .    in @xcite",
    "this will be proved in all cases where @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "of course , this statement covers the case when @xmath1 is @xmath7-dimensional and @xmath20 is @xmath39-dimensional , because handle dimension is always less than or equal to dimension . on the other hand , a simple argument involving the replacement of submanifolds by tubular neighborhoods shows that in proving the conjecture it is enough to consider the opposite extreme , when @xmath1 and @xmath20 are @xmath6-dimensional .",
    "this is the case we will work with .",
    "we now explain a different form of the same conjecture .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth compact @xmath6-dimensional manifold .",
    "assume @xmath57 . for @xmath58",
    "let @xmath59 be a smooth compact manifold triad .",
    "suppose that the manifolds @xmath44 are disjointly embedded in @xmath36 .",
    "for @xmath60 let @xmath19 be the disjoint union @xmath61 and let @xmath62 be the space of embeddings fixed on @xmath63    [ conj2 ] in this situation the @xmath64-dimensional cubical diagram formed by the spaces @xmath65 is @xmath66-cartesian .",
    "let us see that conjecture [ conj2 ] for @xmath67 is equivalent to conjecture [ conj2 ] for @xmath17 .",
    "we can assume that each @xmath20 is @xmath6-dimensional .",
    "first consider the simplest case , @xmath26 and @xmath68 . given @xmath2 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 disjointly embedded in @xmath36 ,",
    "consider the square of fibrations @xmath71\\ar[d ] & e(q_2,n)\\ar[d]\\\\e(q_1,n)\\ar[r ] & e(\\emptyset , n)\\ } \\ ] ] for each choice @xmath37 of a point in @xmath72 , the horizontal maps give a map between the fibers of the vertical maps : @xmath73 the square is @xmath22-cartesian if and only if for every choice of @xmath37 this map of fibers is @xmath22-connected .",
    "the case @xmath74 goes the same way , because more generally ( see [ fiber - cube - connectivity ] below ) a map of @xmath17-cubes is a @xmath22-cartesian @xmath15-cube if and only if for every choice of basepoint the resulting @xmath17-cube of homotopy fibers is @xmath22-cartesian .",
    "note that if one of the @xmath20 is renamed @xmath1 then @xmath66 becomes @xmath54 .",
    "the main result of this paper is stated below , somewhat informally , as theorem [ disjunction ] .",
    "( the precise statement is theorem [ iss ] . )",
    "it is essentially a poincar analogue of conjecture [ conj1 ] above .",
    "it is not an exact analogue : the connectivity is lower by one .",
    "we expect that the conclusion should hold without that slight weakening .",
    "we have settled for the weaker result because it saves a lot of trouble in the proof and because we know how to obtain the sharp result in the smooth case from this not - quite - sharp result in the poincar case .",
    "we limit ourselves to the codimension zero case because that suffices for the purpose at hand , and we assume @xmath27 and @xmath28 are at least three because the proof requires it .    in the poincar case , rather than working with handles",
    "we make the following definition : an @xmath6-dimensional poincar triad @xmath75 has _",
    "homotopy spine dimension@xmath40 relative to @xmath32 if _    1 .",
    "the pair @xmath76 is homotopically @xmath7-dimensional , and 2 .",
    "the pair @xmath77 is @xmath78-connected .",
    "condition ( 1 ) means that the pair is a retract , up to weak equivalence , of a cw pair with relative dimension @xmath40 .",
    "see appendix a for a fuller discussion . for a manifold triad",
    "the homotopy spine dimension is less than or equal to the handle dimension .",
    "a weak form of ( 1 ) would say that @xmath76 is cohomologically @xmath7-dimensional ( has no cohomology above dimension @xmath7 for any coefficient system ) .",
    "a weak form of ( 2 ) would say that @xmath77 is homologically @xmath78-connected ( has no homology below dimension @xmath27 for any coefficient system ) . of course , by duality",
    "the weak ( 1 ) is equivalent to the weak ( 2 ) .",
    "the weak ( 2 ) implies ( 2 ) if the pair @xmath77 is @xmath79-connected , and if @xmath80 the weak ( 1 ) implies ( 1 ) , by [ coh - htpy ] .",
    "thus there is some redundancy here .",
    "[ disjunction ] let @xmath81 be a poincar pair of formal dimension @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83 be poincar triads of formal dimension @xmath6 , where @xmath50 runs from @xmath84 to @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath7 and @xmath39 be the homotopy spine dimensions of @xmath1 relative to @xmath41 and of @xmath20 relative to @xmath44 , and assume that these numbers are all less than or equal to @xmath85 .",
    "suppose that the @xmath20 are disjointly embedded in @xmath2 with @xmath86 and that @xmath41 is embedded in @xmath36 disjointly from all the @xmath87 .",
    "then the cubical diagram formed by the spaces of poincar embeddings @xmath88 is @xmath89-cartesian .",
    "there is an equivalent formulation of this result , related to it as conjecture [ conj2 ] is related to conjecture [ conj1 ]",
    ". we will not write it down here .",
    "it remains to explain what we mean by spaces of ( codimension - zero ) poincar embeddings .",
    "the details are in section 2 , but here is a preliminary account :    if @xmath36 is a closed poincar complex of dimension @xmath90 , consider the category @xmath91 of spaces under @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath92 be the subcategory having all the objects but having only weak equivalences as morphisms .",
    "let @xmath93 be the full subcategory of @xmath92 whose objects @xmath94 satisfy @xmath6-dimensional relative poincar duality .",
    "the nerve of this , or of an equivalent small category , can then be called a space of interiors  for @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath81 is a cw poincar pair then the component of the nerve of @xmath95 determined by @xmath2 is a delooping of the topological monoid @xmath96 of all homotopy equivalences @xmath97 fixing @xmath36 pointwise .",
    "now suppose that @xmath98 and @xmath99 are @xmath6-dimensional poincar triads and that @xmath100 .",
    "then @xmath101 is an @xmath102-dimensional poincar space and there is a functor @xmath103 giving by gluing to @xmath1 along @xmath104 .",
    "this can be described as a two - step process : there are functors @xmath105 resulting from the inclusion  maps @xmath106 the first step is pushforward along the first inclusion , and the second is composition with the other inclusion .",
    "the composed functor takes the subcategory @xmath107 into the subcategory @xmath108    the homotopy fiber , with respect to the point @xmath109 , of this map of spaces of interiors is what we take as the definition of the space @xmath110 of poincar embeddings .",
    "the following imprecise remark is offered as an indication that this is a good definition : @xmath96 may be thought of as acting on @xmath110 , and for any given poincar embedding of @xmath1 in @xmath2 with complement @xmath111 there is a fibration sequence @xmath112 . we will not be using this statement , but the reader is welcome to make it more precise and to extract a proof of it from some of the results in section 2 below .",
    "the best justification for the definition is that on the one hand we can prove a theorem about it here while on the other hand we can use that theorem in @xcite to deduce a theorem about spaces of smooth embeddings .    in order to work with these spaces of interiors  and the relevant maps between them , we need to think systematically about categories of spaces under a fixed space .",
    "specifically , we need to establish something called the _ analyticity of pushforward , _ which may be loosely stated as follows : fix an integer @xmath113 . to a space @xmath114",
    "is associated , as before , the category @xmath115 of spaces under @xmath114 and weak equivalences . define a full subcategory by requiring of an object @xmath116 that the structural map @xmath117 must be both homotopically @xmath118-dimensional and a cofibration .",
    "consider this as a functor of @xmath114 by observing that a map @xmath119 induces a suitable functor @xmath120 from spaces under @xmath114 to spaces under @xmath121 .",
    "passing to realizations of nerves , we obtain a space - valued functor of the space @xmath114 which preserves weak equivalences and ( this is the point ) is analytic in the sense of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for example , when this functor is applied to a homotopy pushout square @xmath122\\ar[d ] & a_1\\ar[d]\\\\ a_2 \\ar[r ] & a_{12 } } \\ ] ] in which the maps @xmath123 are @xmath124-connected , it yields a @xmath125-cartesian square , provided @xmath126 .",
    "the statement generalizes to higher - dimensional cubical diagrams , the general formula being @xmath127 .",
    "one issue not addressed in this rough sketch is that we appeared to need a nerve of a non - small category .",
    "another is that we did not precisely make a functor , since the pushforward along a composition is merely isomorphic , not equal , to a composition of pushforward functors .",
    "incidentally , in discussing such matters , we will sometimes say that a category or a functor is @xmath22-connected , or that a cubical diagram of categories is @xmath22-cartesian .",
    "of course we mean that by making realizations of nerves one gets a @xmath22-connected space or map of spaces , or a @xmath22-cartesian cube of spaces .    in order to work with categories of spaces under a fixed space , and especially to describe the homotopy fibers of certain maps between ( realizations of nerves of ) these , we are led to consider something more general : categories of factorizations of a fixed map of spaces .",
    "two kinds of comments about rigor are worth making here .",
    "first , because of the subject matter ( multirelative or cubical connectivity ) , we must be particularly careful to avoid the kinds of sloppiness that can hide behind phrases like up to equivalenceor up to homotopy .",
    "diagrams must commute on the nose .",
    "for example , it is relatively useless to know that a square diagram @xmath122\\ar[d ] & b\\ar[d]\\\\ c\\ar[r ] & d } \\ ] ] commutes up to homotopy unless one also chooses a particular homotopy between the two maps from @xmath114 to @xmath128 .",
    "questions like is it a homotopy pullback square ?  have no meaning without such a choice . keeping track of the necessary choices of that kind for more complicated diagrams does not hold much appeal for us , hence the insistence on strictly commutative diagrams .",
    "an effect of this careful attention to strict commutativity is that not only the proof but even the detailed statement of theorem [ iss ] is more technical than we could wish .",
    "the result about manifolds to be derived from it in @xcite will look better .",
    "second , the paper has been written in a free and easy way as far as set theory is concerned .",
    "something must be done to guard against such monstrosities as a space that is the realization of the nerve of the category of all spaces .",
    "after all , we are defining a space of poincar embeddings to be the homotopy fiber of a map between two things of just that kind . here",
    "are some suggestions about how to work around these difficulties .",
    "option one : fix a grothendieck universe @xmath129 , and use only @xmath130-sets to make the spaces which are the objects of the category @xmath131 .",
    "various results in the paper refer to spaces that arise from nerves of categories closely related to @xmath132 .",
    "these are not spaces in the same sense , but our statements and proofs are legitimate when they are understood to refer to a larger universe .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether the various large  spaces encountered along the way are in fact weakly homotopy equivalent to small  spaces .",
    "the answer is yes in many cases , including components of factorization categories and those spaces of poincar embeddings that are relevant to our argument .",
    "one disadvantage of this approach is that it assumes the existence of @xmath129 .",
    "option two : place some more drastic restriction on the cardinalities of the spaces in @xmath132 , but not so drastic as to exclude any of the spaces you really care about . to do this carefully while still using",
    "model category language would mean giving up on model category language , or at least weakening the model category axioms about existence of ( co)limits .",
    "option three ( our own favorite ) : learn to call a category @xmath22-connected without making a space out of it : @xmath133 is @xmath22-connected if for every integer @xmath134 from @xmath135 through @xmath136 , for every small subcategory @xmath137 , for every map of @xmath138 into the realization of the nerve of @xmath139 , there exists a small category @xmath140 of @xmath133 containing @xmath139 such that in the realization of its nerve the map extends to @xmath141 .",
    "one might as well be a little more general : call a simplicial class @xmath116 @xmath22-connected if for every integer @xmath134 from @xmath135 through @xmath136 , for every simplicial set @xmath142 , for every map of @xmath138 into the realization of @xmath143 , there exists a larger simplicial set @xmath144 .",
    "similar considerations apply to maps being @xmath22-connected , and to cubical diagrams being @xmath22-cartesian .",
    "the reader can easily verify that the standard tools like the higher blakers - massey theorem  still apply .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows :    section 2 is about categories of factorizations and their nerves with respect to weak equivalence .",
    "it gives a number of general facts and a number of key examples , including those that lead to the definition of spaces of poincar embeddings and some others that are needed in proofs .",
    "section 3 presents a technique , _ homology truncation , that can be used to obtain ( multi-)relative connectivity information about such spaces of factorizations . _",
    "section 4 introduces the principle of analyticity of pushforward and indicates how to prove it , in the case of squares , using the truncation method .",
    "section 5 gives the proof of our main result in the simplest case , @xmath26 and @xmath68 , using the analyticity for squares .",
    "section 6 states and proves the analyticity in rigorous fashion .",
    "the proof is the extension to higher cubes of a method presented very sketchily for squares in section 4 .",
    "section 7 proves the main result .",
    "the proof is an extension to higher cubes of the method described in section 5 for squares .",
    "thus in some sense sections 6 and 7 contain no new ideas , but just technical details .",
    "the technicalities in section 6 are rather extensive , but those in section 7 amount to little more than introducing notation for some subdivided cubical diagrams .",
    "the brief appendix a gives conventions and basic facts about @xmath22-connectedness of maps and homotopical @xmath118-dimensionality of maps .",
    "appendix b recalls conventions and basic results about cubical diagrams , including the higher blakers - massey theorems .",
    "appendix c develops what we need from the theory of poincar duality spaces in a self - contained , self - indulgent , and , we hope , easy - to - read way .",
