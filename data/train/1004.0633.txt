    "the mandelbrot set @xmath0 is defined as the set of quadratic polynomials @xmath1 with connected julia sets .",

    "furthermore , the mandelbrot set is self - similar in a certain sense : there are infinitely many subsets that , together with the induced combinatorics , are canonically homeomorphic to @xmath0 ; these are called _ small copies of @xmath0 within @xmath0_.    there is a classification of all small copies of the mandelbrot set ; every copy has particular dynamical properties , hence all copies can be defined and distinguished in the dynamical planes ( see definition  [ defmm ] ) .    in this paper , we prove the following theorem which was conjectured in the mid-1990 by mikhail lyubich and dierk schleicher , as well as by carsten lunde petersen :    [ mainconj ] let @xmath0 be the mandelbrot set and let @xmath2 be a small copy of the mandelbrot set . then for any @xmath3 , there are at most finitely many connected components of @xmath4 with diameter at least @xmath5 .    the countably many components of @xmath6 are called the decorations of @xmath7 , and the claim is that most of them are small",
    ".    our main tool will be puzzle and parapuzzle theory .",
    "* the entire construction and the proof will be carried out for the mandelbrot set , but they work just the same for all multibrot sets @xmath8 for @xmath9 . we refrained from working out the details for simplicity of notation .",
    "more precisely , everything we are doing uses conformal pull - backs of a single annulus ( in two different cases ) ; we do not encounter problems where the combinatorics grows more slowly than the shrinking of moduli for high - degree pull - backs .",
    "however , we do use the result that all parameters @xmath10 that are not infinitely renormalizable have trivial fibers ( so that @xmath11 is locally connected at these parameters ) .",
    "this was proved by yoccoz for @xmath12 and by kahn and lyubich for all @xmath9 .",
    "the decoration theorem thus holds for all degree @xmath13 .    * remark . *",
    "the entire construction is local in the sense that it not only works for the mandelbrot set , but also for full families of quadratic - like maps ( and similarly for multibrot - like maps ) .",
    "the details are quite similar to the text as written and are omitted .",
    "@xmath14 is a quadratic polynomial .",
    "the level of equipotentials will be called _ height _ , and the _ depth _ of a puzzle piece is the number of iterations it takes to map the puzzle piece to a piece of the initial puzzle .    for every puzzle piece",
    "the upper index is its depth .",
    "if a puzzle piece is `` unique '' , then the subindex will be @xmath15 or @xmath16 depending on the context .",
    "for example , @xmath17 contains the critical point while @xmath18 contains the critical value .",
    "_ we will use the following conventions _ : objects in the parameter plane will be denoted by calligraphic capital letters ( such as @xmath0 , @xmath19 ) while those in dynamical planes will be denoted by roman capitals ( such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "we will use floor brackets ( for example , @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) to untruncate the corresponding puzzle or parapuzzle piece .",
    "following tradition , we slightly abuse ( and thus simplify ) notation and use the modulus of an annulus @xmath24 even when @xmath24 is not open , provided its boundary is piecewise smooth ( which will always be the case for annuli constructed by puzzle pieces ) .    by `` combinatorics '' we mean the angles and heights of rays and equipotentials .",
    "in particular , two puzzle pieces in different planes are ( combinatorially ) the same if there is a homeomorphism of their boundaries sending rays and equipotentials to rays and equipotentials with equal angles and heights .    in the paper",
    "all renormalizations are simple ; we will not consider crossed renormalizations .      in section  [ sec1 ] we will briefly review the puzzle ( and parapuzzle ) construction .",

    "if the decoration theorem was not true , then big decorations must accumulate at some point @xmath25 from the mandelbrot set .",
    "the aim is to show that for every @xmath19 sufficiently close to @xmath25 there exists an annulus @xmath26 such that the following properties hold :    * @xmath26 surrounds @xmath19 , but neither contains nor surrounds @xmath25 ; * the moduli of @xmath26 are uniformly bounded below .",
    "this will conclude the proof .",
    "the first observation is that @xmath25 must be so that the fiber of @xmath0 at @xmath25 is not trivial . therefore , by yoccoz s results it is enough to consider the case when @xmath27 is an infinitely renormalizable polynomial .",
