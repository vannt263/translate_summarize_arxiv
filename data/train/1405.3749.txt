    "even though we have witnessed immense progress in our observational knowledge of galaxies over the past three decades , galaxy formation theory is not yet fully predictive .",
    "this situation has its roots in the strong non - linearity of the dynamics and the vast range of scales and physical effects that couple together and play a crucial role in shaping galaxies .",
    "obtaining theoretical predictions for the abundance , spatial distribution , internal properties , and evolution of galaxies requires numerical simulations that follow the main components of the universe , namely dark energy , dark matter ( dm ) , and normal ( baryonic ) matter from cosmological initial conditions .",
    "while the evolution of the dark components is usually assumed to be governed only by gravitational interactions , which can be simulated to high accuracy , the baryons are clearly subject to the operation of a multitude of physical processes , several of which are extremely complex and poorly understood .",
    "a useful approach for tackling this complexity is to make a series of simplifications to various components of the physics , which necessarily introduce free parameters into the models and reduce their predictive power .",
    "gravity is the basic force that drives structure formation in the universe , and luckily it is also relatively simple to model @xcite , hence it is included in any cosmological simulation .",
    "a dividing line between two common numerical techniques lies in the modeling of the hydrodynamics of cosmic gas . with the so - called semi - analytical technique ( e.g.  @xcite )",

    "these simulations have a significantly increased level of predictive power , and are the state of the art for cosmological simulations .",
    "additional physical components and processes , such as chemistry , star - formation , radiation , magnetic fields , cosmic rays , and the high - energy physics around black holes affect the formation of galaxies in a significant way , so that they must be modeled in a coarse , parameterised form , which in the context of hydrodynamical simulations is often termed ` sub - resolution ' .",
    "given the significant difference between semi - analytical models and hydrodynamical simulations , they have been used for largely orthogonal purposes .",
    "semi - analytical models , thanks to their higher flexibility in physics modeling and significantly lower computational cost , have targeted an ambitious goal : reproducing , in a statistical sense , all available observations of galaxies @xcite .",
    "progress is being made by tuning the free parameters of the models and testing the results against observations @xcite .",
    "however , hydrodynamical cosmological simulations , due to their limited flexibility and high computational cost with respect to semi - analytical models , have usually targeted more focused applications @xcite , sometimes even in ` zoom - in ' simulations of a handful of particular objects @xcite . they are often employed to study the effects of various models on a particular issue , without explicitly aiming at reproducing a multitude of observations @xcite . only very recently ,",

    "the frontier in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations since they came to existence about two decades ago has been pushed forward in three distinct directions .",

    "this allows the combination of numerical resolution ( required both for resolving fine details and for the robustness of numerical models ) and cosmological volume ( required for making statistically - meaningful comparisons with large observed data sets ) to be ever improved @xcite .",
    "second , the scope , complexity , and numerical robustness of sub - resolution models have been extended and improved upon , in order to provide a more complete and accurate description of the physical processes that shape galaxies , such as star - formation and feedback @xcite , black - hole growth and feedback @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , and cosmic rays @xcite . finally , numerical techniques have been improved to provide more accurate solutions of the underlying equations of gravity and hydrodynamics @xcite . these trends",

    "each snapshot was post - processed by extended and optimized versions of the and algorithms @xcite , to identify halos and subhalos and their properties .",
    "the illustris simulations were evolved with the moving - mesh code @xcite , which solves the euler equations with godunov s scheme on a quasi - lagrangian moving voronoi mesh .",
    "we have shown this method to be advantageous in terms of accuracy compared to the traditional methods of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) and adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) @xcite .",
    "the full details of the physical models used in illustris are described in @xcite , and the monte - carlo tracer particle technique is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the physics modeling includes , on top of gravity , hydrodynamics , and a uniform ionizing background @xcite in an expanding universe , a set of sub - resolution models for processes that are important for galaxy formation .",
    "these include radiative cooling ( primordial as well as by heavy elements ) with self - shielding corrections , star - formation in high - density gas , stellar evolution with associated metal enrichment and mass return , star - formation feedback that uses @xmath34 per supernova explosion to drive kinetic galactic winds , black hole seeding , accretion and merging , and finally three distinct types of agn feedback : quasar - mode , radio - mode , and a radiative mode .",
    "the @xmath35 or so free parameters of the models , associated mostly with the various feedback processes , all have a physical meaning , and can be assigned numerical values based on underlying principles , but given our ignorance and uncertainties regarding the complicated physics of , e.g.  star - formation and black - hole accretion , there is freedom in their exact values . in practice ,",
    "a subset of them was tuned to their particular values based on test simulations ( of a much smaller volume , @xmath36 on a side ) , which we only compared against less than a handful of basic observations , in particular the history of cosmic star - formation rate ( sfr ) density and the @xmath2 stellar mass function , ensuring that they were roughly reproduced .",
    "full details on the physics models and the choice of parameters appear in @xcite .",
    "the finite computational resources available for any simulation impose limits on the mass , spatial , and temporal scales that can be simulated and resolved . for periodic - box ( non-`zoom - in ' ) cosmological simulations , the main compromises that can be made to render the calculation tractable are the cosmic time that is followed and the number of resolution elements .",
    "the latter , in turn , constrains the combination of simulation box size and mass resolution . in choosing the parameters for illustris ,",
    "the available computational resources together with our goal of running the simulation to @xmath2 fixed the number of resolution elements at @xmath0 .",
    "further , the combination of this number of total resolution elements with our choice to resolve @xmath37 galaxies with tens of thousands of resolution elements each ( which allows to reach convergence for those systems as well as to obtain a spatial resolution of @xmath38 scales ) , is what determined the size of the illustris simulation volume .",
    "the resulting box side length of @xmath11 , is , as argued below , in a ` transition region ' between small boxes of sizes that deviate from linear growth at low redshift and suffer from strong cosmic variance , and large boxes that remain ` homogeneous ' down to @xmath2 and contain statistical samples even of cluster - scale dm halos ( see also @xcite ) . as shown in @xcite , the most massive halo in the illustris box",
    "has @xmath39 , which means that the volume is not large enough to contain the most massive halos , the ones that host galaxy clusters such as the virgo cluster .",
    "however , the number of ` cluster - scale ' halos with @xmath40 is @xmath41 , and the number of ` milky - way - like ' halos with @xmath42 ( roughly corresponding to the @xcite estimate ) is @xmath43 .",
    "the fact that illustris contains hundreds of @xmath37 galaxies , each resolved with tens of thousands of resolution elements , as well as several small clusters , each resolved tens of millions of resolution elements , all in one self - consistent volume , is a direct result of the large number of resolution elements evolved in the simulation down to @xmath2 .",
    "the initial conditions were selected manually from a set of @xmath44 trials that represent different random realizations of the illustris cosmology in a @xmath11 box , each evolved using a low - resolution dm - only simulation to @xmath2 .",
    "the criteria for choosing one out of those hundred were that the dm halo mass function should not deviate strongly from the theoretical mass function ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and that the box is relatively spatially homogeneous upon a visual inspection . in this crude way",
    ", we attempted to run illustris as a ` representative ' volume of @xmath45 ( see the illustris halo mass function in @xcite ) .",
    "we will now investigate to what degree cosmic variance on the scale of @xmath11 is expected to affect some basic baryonic characteristics of the illustris volume .",
    "specifically , we will estimate the expected cosmic variance of the stellar mass functions at several redshifts , and of the history of the cosmic sfr density @xmath46 .",
    "we determine the cosmic variance sensitivity of those quantities utilizing an estimate of the cosmic variance of the dm halo mass function that we extract from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "we first select from the millennium simulation @xmath47 mutually - exclusive cubic sub - volumes of @xmath11 on a side .",
    "we also define mutually - exclusive bins of halo mass , and for each of the sub - volumes , we use those bins to quantify the halo mass function .",
    "then we record the difference ( in logarithmic space ) between the @xmath48th , @xmath49th , and @xmath50th percentiles of the halo mass function among the various sub - volumes .",
    "this procedure is repeated for different redshifts . in the second step ,",
    "we calculate the contribution of each of the mutually - exclusive halo mass bins to the stellar mass function and to the history of cosmic sfr density from the full illustris volume .",
    "in addition , we record a ` @xmath51-higher ' ( ` @xmath51-lower ' ) contribution from each bin , by adding , in logarithmic space , the corresponding @xmath50th percentile - to - median ( @xmath48th percentile - to - median ) difference that we obtained in the first step to the actual contribution of that bin in illustris .",
    "this gives only a small over - estimate of the cosmic variance for those bins , since at such low masses the cosmic variance is almost independent of mass .",
    "] . finally , we construct stellar mass functions and the history of cosmic sfr density from illustris by summing up the contributions to these quantities coming from the various halo mass bins .",
    "this is done both for the actual values measured from illustris ( which gives a result identical to simply taking all halos without summing them up in bins first ) as well as for the ` @xmath51-higher ' and ` @xmath51-lower ' contributions .",
    "thereby , we obtain an estimate for each of those baryonic quantities had they been built from dm halo mass functions that deviate from the illustris halo mass functions systematically by @xmath52 .",
    "however , for these systematically - offset quantities to exactly represent @xmath51 variations around the actual values , several assumptions need to be made : * ( a ) * the distribution among the sub - volumes is lognormal , * ( b ) * the halo mass bins are independent , * ( c ) * the illustris halo mass function is exactly the median one , and * ( d ) * the baryonic quantities in question scale linearly with the halo mass . since it is clear that these assumptions do not strictly hold , but are only approximations ( see , e.g.  @xcite )",
    ", we first verify that this approach provides reliable estimates . to do that , we repeat the procedure described above , but instead divide the millennium simulation into @xmath53 sub - volumes in order to estimate the cosmic variance on a @xmath36 scale sub - volumes of @xmath36 . ] .    in fig .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance_sfrh_25mpc ] we present the history of cosmic sfr density @xmath46 for illustris ( dashed thick curve ) with its @xmath36-scale cosmic variance estimate ( shaded region ) .",
    "we compare this estimate with the actual sfr density histories for @xmath54 mutually - exclusive sub - volumes of the illustris volume ( thin curves ) .",
    "it is apparent that roughly @xmath55 of the sub - volumes are inside the cosmic variance estimate obtained with our procedure , as expected .",
    "a similar exercise is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance_smf_25mpc ] for the @xmath2 stellar mass function , with the same conclusion , namely that our procedure produces reliable estimates of the cosmic variance .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance ]    before discussing the cosmic variance on @xmath11 scales , it is worth commenting here with respect to the actual magnitude of cosmic variance on the @xmath36 scale . both for @xmath46 and for the @xmath2 stellar mass function",
    "it is quite large , both in absolute terms ( root - mean - square deviations of factor @xmath56 ) , and more importantly , compared to the observational uncertainties .",
    "since the parameters of our galaxy formation physics models were tuned to reproduce those two quantities using a @xmath36 box @xcite , it should be expected that these parameter choices suffer from the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "indeed , the history of cosmic sfr density and stellar mass function as tuned for on the @xmath36 box from @xcite are not exactly reproduced in the illustris volume .",
    "in fact , the particular @xmath36 box we used can now be judged as somewhat ` unlucky ' in the sense that both quantities are approximately @xmath57 lower in that box compared to illustris , such that illustris moved @xmath58 away from the observational data in the upwards direction .    in figs .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance_sfrh_75mpc ] and [ f : cosmic_variance_smf_75mpc ] we present @xmath46 , and the stellar mass functions at redshifts @xmath59 , respectively , together with the estimates for cosmic variance on the scale of the full simulation box .",
    "it is clear by comparison to the upper panels that the cosmic variance is dramatically reduced on the @xmath11 scale compared with the @xmath36 scale . in particular ,",
    "the cosmic variance is smaller than the current observational uncertainties .",
    "this justifies our statement above that a cosmological box with a side length of @xmath11 has a large enough volume so that it does not suffer from detrimental cosmic variance effects .",
    "we expect these two quantities to be potentially most significantly affected by cosmic variance , certainly more than scaling relations between internal galaxy properties , which are examined throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the results we present hereafter are likely only mildly sensitive to cosmic variance , and hence we will not consider such effects throughout the rest of this work .",
    "in this section we examine how the stellar mass builds up across cosmic time in the illustris simulation .",
    "we begin by examining the history of cosmic sfr density shown in fig .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance_sfrh_75mpc ] , where it is also broken up into contributions from different halo mass bins . by tuning the free parameters of the various feedback models @xcite , we were able to obtain a good match at @xmath60 .",

    "the @xmath2 cosmic sfr density in illustris is @xmath64 higher than the various observational estimates .",
    "[ f : cosmic_variance_sfrh_75mpc ] shows that the dominant contributors to @xmath46 are halos of @xmath65 at all @xmath66 , and in particular at @xmath67 , with an additional contribution , smaller by approximately a factor of two , from halos of @xmath68 ( for a breakdown by stellar mass see @xcite ) .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with predictions of empirical models @xcite .",
    "future improvements to the modeling will require suppression of star - formation at the mass scale of @xmath69 to obtain a better quantitative agreement with the @xmath61 observations .    in fig .",
    "[ f : smf ] we present the stellar mass functions obtained in illustris at various redshifts from @xmath3 to @xmath2 , and compare them to observations . for ease of readability , we present odd redshifts ( @xmath70 ) in the left panel , and even redshifts ( @xmath71 ) in the right panel .",
    "we find overall excellent agreement between illustris and the observations , in particular given that the free parameters that control the feedback processes in illustris have been tuned to only approximately match the @xmath2 stellar mass function .",
    "however , we do find several tensions with respect to the observations that are worth noting : * ( a ) * at the lowest redshifts the abundance at the massive end ( @xmath72 ) is somewhat overestimated ( see discussion below and in section [ s : z0massiveend ] ) . *",
    "( b ) * at the highest redshifts , @xmath73 , the abundance at the corresponding massive end ( @xmath74 ) is underestimated , however only by @xmath52 . * ( c ) * at low redshift , @xmath61 , the abundance below the knee ( @xmath75 ) is overestimated by @xmath76 ( see also @xcite ) . *",
    "( d ) * at high redshift , @xmath77 , the slope at the low - mass end ( @xmath78 ) steepens with increasing redshift faster than observed .",
    "it is worth noting that the measurements for these low masses at high redshifts are taken from @xcite , whose mass function for the more massive galaxies ( @xmath74 ) is systematically lower than other measurements at @xmath79 ( e.g.  @xcite that is shown here ) .",
    "for this reason , and also more generally , the observations at high redshift should be taken with caution with respect to systematics .",

    "we find that the ratio between the simulated and observed mass functions have a rather well - defined s shape , whose normalization depends on redshift .",
    "the best agreement occurs around the knee of the mass function , at @xmath81 , where the illustris mass function is equal to or lower than observed by @xmath58 . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the redshift dependence of the variations is approximately monotonic , with the difference between illustris and the observations increasing at progressively lower redshifts .",
    "an extended discussion of stellar masses in the most massive halos at low redshift appears later in this section and in section [ s : z0massiveend ] , but here we focus on the differences at the low - mass end . for @xmath82 , illustris overshoots the observed mass functions .",
    "this is increasingly the case at lower masses , which represents a steeper slope in illustris than observed .",
    "however , in this mass range the redshift dependence is non - monotonic , with the largest differences found at @xmath83 . at both lower and higher redshifts ,",
    "the deviations show parallel sequences to that at @xmath83 , offset towards lower values by @xmath84 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that the difference in slope between illustris and observations is constant with redshift , even though both show a steepening towards higher redshifts .",
    "both these aspects of our model are discussed also in @xcite , based on a smaller cosmological volume .",
    "finally , for @xmath78 , the observed mass functions show a reverse knee and steepen , a feature that is not reproduced in illustris .",

    "the baryon conversion efficiency at masses beyond the peak is rather constant , in agreement with both @xcite and illustris .",
    "however , the behaviour at masses below the peak is rather different ; instead of a constant slope and a decreasing normalization towards higher redshifts as in @xcite and in illustris , @xcite find shallower slopes at higher redshifts . to summarize the comparison to results derived by abundance matching , we find that the evolution of the stellar mass to halo mass relation shares some features with the @xcite results and some with @xcite , and where both abundance matching results agree , the agreement is shared by illustris as well .",

    "our main findings are recapped below .    *",
    "* galaxy stellar masses . *",
    "we find that the stellar mass functions and relations between stellar mass and halo mass at redshifts @xmath230 are generally in good agreement with observations ( section [ s : smf_msmh ] ) .",
    "this may indicate that the combination of gas cooling and accretion , in concert with gas ejection induced by feedback processes , are broadly captured in our simulation , in both the physical and numerical sense .",
    "this result is numerically robust , in the sense that it is converged with respect to resolution @xcite , and in the sense that our @xmath1 simulation volume is large enough such that the uncertainty due to cosmic variance is small compared to the observational uncertainties , as we show in section [ s : cosmic_variance ] . as the details of the physical modelling",
    "were calibrated to roughly reproduce galaxy masses in the local universe , it is a remarkable result that the stellar mass functions at higher redshifts are in fact in an even better agreement with observations than at @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , several important tensions with observations do exist , in particular at low redshift .",
    "even though the feedback processes we employ are very energetic , additional suppression of galaxy stellar masses is probably required both in low - mass and in high - mass halos .",
    "we find it very plausible that higher energetics will not solve the problems easily , and may in fact introduce new discrepancies , as discussed below .",
    "therefore , we believe that future research is needed to develop improved algorithms for sub - resolution feedback prescriptions that will capture reality more faithfully and lead to increased efficiency of the suppression of star - formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) . *",
    "* halo gas content .",
    "* we find that at low redshift , massive halos of @xmath231 are almost devoid of gas as a result of radio - mode agn feedback , in disagreement with observations ( section [ s : gas_halos ] ) .",
    "hence , there remains no freedom in changing the energetics alone of agn feedback in our model to match both the stellar and the gaseous contents of massive halos ( see also sijacki et al .",
    "( in prep . ) , where a detailed account of black hole properties in illustris is given ) .",
    "this probably means that other aspects of our implementation of agn feedback require modification .",
    "for example , its duty cycle may be too low , such that short and strong bursts are able to expel large amounts of mass to large distances while not suppressing residual star - formation completely .",
    "some agn feedback models , indeed , obtain reasonable stellar masses in massive halos while in fact having the opposite problem of not suppressing the gas mass _ enough _ @xcite for a set of ` zoom - in ' massive halos does not guarantee that the model reproduces correct stellar masses for lower - mass halos and at higher redshifts as well . as the baryon conversion efficiency of halos of different masses are not independent of each other ,",
    "only a full cosmological box can truly constrain any particular agn feedback model . ] .",
    "it is also possible that a simpler modification , such as reducing the total energetics of agn feedback , would result in more realistic gas properties .",
    "however , in such a case , other processes that we are currently neglecting will have to be modeled in order to suppress the buildup of stellar mass .",
    "such processes may include non - equilibrium metal line cooling in agn proximity zones @xcite , cosmic ray pressure support @xcite , and thermal conduction @xcite .",
    "* * galaxies around massive hosts . * the stellar content of satellite galaxies in massive halos is found to be in good agreement with observations ( section [ s : z0massiveend ] ) .",
    "the masses and spatial distribution of satellites inside and around massive halos can serve as strong tests of theoretical models , as they are sensitive to both gravity , hydrodynamics , and feedback processes .",
    "hence , we find it to be an important success of our simulation that it reproduces the observed profiles of galaxies around massive hosts ( section [ s : satellites ] ) .",
    "we find that in physical units , and when satellite are selected using a constant mass ratio , the evolution of the galaxy number density profiles is weak , in agreement with existing observations up to @xmath118 .",
    "we find that this non - evolution extends to even higher redshifts @xmath168 , and give quantitative predictions in this regard .",
    "we also give predictions for a different selection of satellite galaxies , based on a constant magnitude , which extend existing observations to a larger redshift range . *",
    "* circular velocity profiles . *",
    "we study galaxy circular velocity profiles as a function of galaxy stellar mass , redshift , and radius , out to @xmath99 ( section [ s : gas_halos ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath2 galaxies in illustris have rising or flat rotation curves inside the radius where baryons dominate the mass , typically a few percent of @xmath99 .",
    "the peak value of the circular velocity is however larger than @xmath135 , as a result of baryon condensation , and in agreement with observations . for the most massive galaxies at @xmath110 ,",
    "however , we predict that the stellar component is more concentrated , which drives a peak in the circular velocity profile at smaller radii , around @xmath232 .",
    "we also find that the dark matter halo responds to baryonic effects in a non - monotonic mass - dependent way , which reaches peak contraction for galaxies with @xmath195 at @xmath2 and for higher stellar masses at higher redshifts .",
    "due to our implementation of a ` smooth ' star - formation feedback , low - mass galaxies do not alter the structure of their host halos , and in particular do not create a dark matter core . *",
    "* galaxy gas fractions . *",
    "we study galaxy molecular gas fractions as a function of stellar mass and redshift in section [ s : gas_galaxies ] .",
    "we find good agreement with observations within the various modelling and observational uncertainties , up to the highest measured redshifts , at @xmath233 .",
    "we find increasing gas fractions with redshift up to @xmath165 , above which the increase stops and the dependence on redshift flattens , while the mass dependence steepens .",
    "these predictions are testable against upcoming observations . *",
    "* specific star - formation rates . *",
    "we quantify the evolution of galaxy specific star - formation rates ( section [ s : ssfr ] ) , and find that they are in generally good agreement with observations all the way up to @xmath234 .",
    "however , the tension that is common to all hydrodynamical simulations , and almost all theoretical models in general , namely that the specific star - formation rates at @xmath172 are underestimated , remains in illustris as well .",
    "we find that the specific star - formation rates in illustris follow very closely the specific accretion rates of dark matter halos , albeit with a normalization offset of a factor @xmath129 towards higher specific star - formation rates .",
    "understanding this curious similarity will be the subject of future work .",
    "* * galaxy morphologies . *",
    "we present a qualitative account of galaxy morphologies from @xmath2 to @xmath6 by presenting images of typical galaxies as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "in addition , we create mock images of these selected galaxies as they would realistically appear in the hubble ultra deep field ( section [ s : morphologies ] ) .",
    "we find , in agreement with observations , that galaxies become more irregular and clumpy towards higher redshift , with increasing gas surface densities .",
    "we also identify the buildup of red bulges towards higher masses and lower redshifts . *",
    "* time evolution of individual galaxies in mass , size , and star - formation rate .",
    "* we follow galaxy populations in time using merger trees , and study their evolutionary tracks ( section [ s : mergertrees ] ) . in one application ,",
    "we select galaxies at @xmath7 and study their mass evolution and major merger histories down to @xmath2 .",
    "we find that @xmath7 galaxies that are above the star - formation main sequence are far more likely to undergo a major merger by @xmath2 than galaxies that are on the main sequence itself at @xmath7 , and that their @xmath2 descendants are typically more massive .",
    "interestingly , also the most quenched @xmath7 galaxies ( those far below the star - formation main sequence ) have higher chances of undergoing a future major merger .",
    "these trends suggest a similarity between extreme star - formation rates and quenching , that both are related to the large - scale environments of galaxies and to their long - term formation histories .",
    "we also study the evolution of galaxies in the parameter space of their star - formation activity and their compactness , and find a strong mass segregation in the nature of size evolution and quenching time scales .",
    "the illustris simulation illuminates the distinct physical processes at play , and provides a powerful framework for interpreting current and future observations of galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "we are grateful to andrei kravtsov and tomer tal for providing us with their data and their helpful interpretations .",
