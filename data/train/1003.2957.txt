    ", the understanding of the properties of exotic nuclei , as well as neutron stars and supernova dynamics , entails constraining the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy , which describes the difference between the binding energy of symmetric matter ( with equal proton and neutron numbers , n = z ) , and that of pure neutron matter .",
    "transient states of nuclear matter far from normal conditions can be created in terrestrial laboratories via heavy ion collisions ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "many experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted , over the past 30 years , to the study of nuclear reactions from low to intermediate energies , as a possible tool to learn about the behavior of nuclear matter and its @xmath5 .",
    "relevant conclusions have been reached concerning the @xmath5 of symmetric matter for densities up to five time the saturation value @xcite .",
    "more recently , the availability of neutron - rich and exotic beams has opened the way to investigate , in laboratory conditions , new aspects of nuclear structure and dynamics up to extreme ratios of neutron to proton numbers .",
    "thus it has become possible to explore the behavior of nuclear matter along a new degree of freedom , the asymmetry @xmath6 ( in the rest of the review also defined as @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) , aiming at constraining the density and/or temperature dependence of the symmetry energy ( @xmath1 ) . here",
    "we will review the isospin dynamics in @xmath0 from the coulomb barrier to relativistic energies .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath9 appears in the energy density @xmath10 , expressed in terms of total ( @xmath11 ) and isospin ( @xmath12 ) densities @xcite .",
    "the symmetry term gets a kinetic contribution directly from basic pauli correlations and a potential part from the highly controversial isospin dependence of the effective interactions . both at sub - saturation and supra - saturation densities , predictions based of the existing many - body techniques diverge rather widely , see @xcite .",

    "several observables which are sensitive to the @xmath1 and testable experimentally , have been suggested @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of new opportunities in theory ( development of rather reliable microscopic transport codes for @xmath0 ) and in experiments ( availability of very asymmetric radioactive beams , improved possibility of measuring event - by - event correlations ) to present new results that are constraining the existing effective interaction models",
    ". we will discuss dissipative collisions in a wide range of beam energies , from just above the coulomb barrier up to the @xmath2 range .",
    "isospin effects on the chiral / deconfinement transition at high baryon density will be also analyzed .",
    "low to fermi energies will bring information on the symmetry term around ( below ) normal density , while intermediate energies will probe high density regions .",
    "the transport codes are based on mean field theories , with correlations included via hard nucleon - nucleon elastic and inelastic collisions and via stochastic forces , selfconsistently evaluated from the mean phase - space trajectory , see @xcite .",
    "stochasticity is essential in order to get distributions as well as to allow the growth of dynamical instabilities .",
    "relativistic collisions are described via a fully covariant transport approach , related to an effective field exchange model , where the relevant degrees of freedom of the nuclear dynamics are accounted for @xcite .",
    "we will have a propagation of particles suitably dressed by self - energies that will influence collective flows and in medium nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross sections .",
    "the construction of an @xmath13 at high baryon and isospin densities will finally allow the possibility of developing a model of a hadron - deconfinement transition at high density for an asymmetric matter @xcite .",
    "the problem of a correct treatment of the isospin in an effective partonic @xmath5 will be stressed .",
    "at low to intermediate energies the evolution of systems governed by a complex phase space can be described via a transport equation ( of the boltzmann - nordheim - vlasov type ) with a fluctuating term , the so - called boltzmann - langevin equation ( ble ) @xcite @xmath14   + \\delta i[f],\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the one - body distribution function , or wigner transform of the one - body density , @xmath16 the mean field hamiltonian , @xmath17 the two - body collision term ( that accounts for the residual interaction ) incorporating the fermi statistics of the particles , and @xmath18 $ ] the fluctuating part of the collision integral @xcite .",
    "the system is described in terms of the one - body distribution function @xmath19 , however this function may experience a stochastic evolution in response to the action of the fluctuating term @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "this is an effective way to insert again into the dynamics the effects of unknown correlations and of the loss of information caused by the projection of the many - body dynamics onto a much reduced subspace . here",
    "we will follow the approximate treatment to the ble presented in refs.@xcite , the stochastic mean field ( smf ) model , that consists in the implementation of stochastic spatial density fluctuations .",
    "the nuclear eos , directly linked to the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath20 , can be written as : @xmath21 we adopt a soft isoscalar eos , @xmath22 , with compressibility modulus @xmath23 , which is favored from monopole oscillations in stable nuclei as well as from flow studies @xcite .",
    "we will always test the sensitivity of our simulation results to different choices of the density and momentum dependence of the isovector part of the equation of state ( @xmath1 ) . in the non - relativistic frame the potential part of the symmetry energy , @xmath24 , @xcite : @xmath25 is tested by employing three different density parametrizations of the symmetry potentials @xcite , one with a rapidly increasing behaviour with density , roughly proportional to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , one with a linear increase of the potential part of the symmetry energy with density ( @xmath28 ) and one with a kind of saturation around normal density ( @xmath29 ) , even decreasing at higher densities .        [ esymdens ]    in particular , for the symmetry term with the stronger density dependence , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the saturation density , a=12.7 mev ( fixed by the kinetic contribution eq.[esym ] ) and b=19 mev , to give a saturation value of @xmath32",
    ". the linear density dependence is simply given by : @xmath33 for the symmetry term with weaker density dependence around saturation @xmath34 where a=12.7 mev .",
    "the three parameterizations cross at normal density at the empirically known symmetry energy coefficient of the bethe - weizscker formula .",
    "as shown in fig.1 the symmetry energy at densities below the normal value is larger in the asysoft case , while above saturation it is higher in the asystiff cases . hence in the low - density regime , that is the region of interest for our analysis in heavy ion collisions at fermi energies , isospin effects are expected to be stronger in the asysoft case .",
    "opposite expectations can be derived for relativistic collisions , where high density regions will be probed in the early stage of the collision . in any case , for mechanisms sensitive to the density derivative of the symmetry energy an asystiff - like behavior is more effective .      a particular attention is devoted to the isospin effects on the momentum dependence of the symmetry potentials , i.e. to observables sensitive to a different neutron / proton effective mass in asymmetric matter .",
    "the problem of momentum dependence in the isovector channel ( @xmath35 ) is still very controversial and it would be extremely important to get more definite experimental information , see the refs .",
    "exotic beams at intermediate energies are of interest in order to have high momentum particles and to test regions of high baryon ( isoscalar ) and isospin ( isovector ) density during the reaction dynamics .",
    "our transport code has been implemented with a generalized form of the effective interactions , which can be easily reduced to skyrme - like forces , with momentum dependent terms also in the isovector channel @xcite , i.e. with a different @xmath36 mean field momentum dependence .",
    "the general structure of the isoscalar and isovector momentum dependent ( md ) effective fields is derived via an isospin asymmetric extension of the gale - bertsch - dasgupta ( gbd ) force @xcite , which corresponds to a yukawian non - locality .",
    "the isovector momentum dependence implies different effective masses for protons and neutrons given as @xmath37 , for @xmath38 , at fixed density .",

    "this is hown in fig.[esymastar ] where we plot the density dependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy , in the asy - stiff case , for the two choices of the n / p mass splitting ( solid lines , upper panels ) .",

    "a change in the sign of the mass splitting is related to opposite behaviors of these two contributions , exactly like it happens in skyrme - like forces , see sections ( 2.1 - 2.2 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the lower panels show the density dependence of the corresponding mass splitting , for an asymmetry parameter @xmath42 ( the @xmath46au asymmetry ) . in order to probe the mass splitting effects on the heavy ion dynamics",

    "we see that the momentum dependence modifies the effect of the symmetry term stiffness on the nucleon potentials , with differences that become more appreciable with increasing nucleon momenta . from this figure",
    "we can already predict large effects of the effective mass splitting at high momenta .",
    "this is shown more explicitly in fig.[mdpot ] where we see the momentum dependence of the neutron - proton potentials at saturation density for the two mass splitting choices , always for a `` typical '' @xmath42 asymmetry ( @xmath52 ... ) .",

    "the isoscalar eos becomes stiffer when the momentum dependence is included .",
    "* @xmath61 .",
    "isospin effects on the momentum dependence imply different slopes around @xmath62 for neutrons and protons , as clearly shown in fig.[mdpot ] , and so the larger repulsion above @xmath62 is different . in the case",
    "@xmath53 the high momentum neutrons will see a more repulsive field with respect to the high-@xmath59 protons .",
    "the opposite will happen in the @xmath54 case .",
    "the fast nucleon emission will be directly affected : in the @xmath53 case we expect a larger @xmath39 yield for nucleons emitted in central collisions and a larger neutron @xmath63 ( elliptic flow ) in semicentral collisions in heavy ion reactions at intermediate energies , in particular for high @xmath64 ( transverse momentum ) selections .",
    "in fact in the interacting , high density , early stage of the reaction dynamics the pressure is built from violent nucleon - nucleon collisions and the high @xmath64 particles will carry the maximal information on high density and momentum dependence of the symmetry potentials . the azimuthal distributions ( elliptic flows ) will be particularly affected since particles mostly retain their high transverse momenta escaping along directions orthogonal to the reaction plane without suffering much rescattering processes . + in sect.5 we will test those predictions also for n - rich vs. n - poor light ions , like ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , easier to detect . since ,",
    "as already noted , the symmetry potentials are not very different in the asystiff / asysoft choice for the density range probed at intermediate energies , we can expect that the @xmath67 effect could be even larger than the one related to the different stiffness of the symmetry term .",
    "the presence of an isovector dipole oscillation in the entrance channel dynamics has been suggested by several authors in order to account for the fast charge equilibration , and even for the fragment charge distributions , in deep inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "since the oscillation is triggered by the mean field of a dilute dinuclear composite system this mechanism seems to appropriate for the study of the symmetry term below saturation , which is acting as a restoring force",
    ". a direct observation of the corresponding radiative emission would be then interesting .",
    "in fact the clear dynamical features of such _ pre - equilibrium _ dipole mode ( large deformations of the source , preferential oscillation on the reaction plane ) will allow to distinguish this radiation from the @xmath68-emission of the statistical giant dipole resonances ( @xmath69 ) of the final excited reaction products .      the possibility of an entrance channel collective dipole , and corresponding radiation , due to an initial different n / z distribution was predicted at the beginning of the nineties @xcite .",
    "after several experimental evidences , in fusion as well as in deep - inelastic reactions , @xcite and refs .",
    "therein , we have now a good understanding of the process and stimulating new perspectives from the use of radioactive beams , to enhance the sensitivity to the @xmath1 .    in the first stages of dissipative reactions between colliding ions with different n / z ratios , a large amplitude dipole collective motion develops in the mean field of the composite dinuclear system , the so - called dynamical dipole mode .",
    "this gives rise to a prompt @xmath70-ray emission which depends : i ) on the absolute value of the intial dipole moment @xmath71 being @xmath72 and @xmath73 the center of mass of protons and of neutrons respectively , while r@xmath74 and r@xmath75 are the projectile and target radii ; ii ) on the fusion / deep - inelastic dynamics , which rules the formation of the dinuclear mean field ; iii ) on the symmetry term , below saturation , that is acting as a restoring force . a detailed description can consistently obtained in mean field transport approaches , @xcite .",

    "we expect a decrease of the direct dipole radiation for two main reasons both due to the increasing importance of hard nn collisions : i ) a larger fast neutron emission that will equilibrate the isospin during the dipole oscillation ; ii ) a larger damping of the collective mode due to @xmath93 collisions .    the use of unstable neutron rich projectiles would largely increase the effect , due to the possibility of larger entrance channel asymmetries @xcite . in order to suggest proposals for the new @xmath94 facility @xmath95 ,",

    "it nicely points out a collective behavior which initiates very early , with a dipole moment still close to the touching configuration value reported above .",

    "the corresponding results for the stable `` 124 '' system are drawn in the right panel .",
    "as expected from the larger initial charge asymmetry , we clearly see an increase of the prompt dipole emission for the exotic n - rich beam .",
    "such entrance channel effect will be enhanced , allowing a better observation of the iso - eos dependence .",
    "we recall that in the asystiff case we have a weaker restoring force for the dynamical dipole in the dilute `` neck '' region , where the symmetry energy is smaller @xcite .",
    "this is reflected in lower values of the centroids as well as in reduced total yields , as shown in fig.[yield1 ] .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath105 to the stiffness of the symmetry energy will be amplified by the increase of @xmath106 when we use exotic , more asymmetric beams .",
    "the prompt dipole radiation angular distribution is the result of the interplay between the collective oscillation life - time and the dinuclear rotation . in this sense",
    "we also expect a sensitivity to the @xmath1 of the anisotropy , in particular for high spin event selections .",
    "e.g. we remind that in the asy - stiff case we have a delayed onset of the collective dipole ( see fig.[dip ] ) , the emitting system will get more rotation and the angular anisotropy will be reduced @xcite .    in the asysoft choice",
    "we expect also larger widths of the `` resonance '' due to the larger fast neutron emission .",
    "we note the opposite effect of the asy - stiffness on neutron vs proton emissions .",
    "the latter point is important even for the possibility of an independent test just measuring the @xmath107 of the pre - equilibrium nucleon emission , @xcite .    in general",
    "the collective dipole mechanism for charge equilibration will be important in a limited range of beam energies @xcite",
    ". we must be well above the coulomb barrier in order to have a fast formation of the dinuclear mean field , but when the direct nucleon - nucleon collisions will be more frequent we expect a rapid quenching of the isovector collective mode",
    ". in sect.4 we will discuss charge equilibration at the fermi energies , in a kind of overdamped regime .",
    "the mechanism is now based on the isospin diffusion , on a time scale again ruled by the symmetry term at sub - saturation density .",
    "heavy ion collisions ( @xmath0 ) in the fermi energy domain ( 30 - 100 amev ) are dominated by fragmentation mechanisms .",
    "after moderate compression effects during the first stage of the collision , the composite nuclear system expands and eventually separates into fragments , whose multiplicity and characteristics depend on the centrality of the reaction .",
    "however , as we will illustrate in the following , regardless of the possible different outcomes , fragment properties are always closely linked to the development of density gradients along the reaction path . in the energy range",
    "considered , the properties of nuclear matter below normal density are mostly concerned , allowing one to investigate the low density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "in central collisions , where the full disassembly of the system into many intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) and particles is observed , one can study specifically properties of liquid - gas phase transitions occurring in asymmetric matter in the presence of radial flow . in neutron - rich matter in the coexistence region one expects to observe isospin distillation : fragments ( liquid ) appear more symmetric with respect to the initial matter , while light particles ( gas ) are more neutron - rich @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this effect depends on characteristic properties of the isovector sector of the eos namely on the value and the slope of the symmetry energy at low density @xcite .",
    "moreover , interesting correlations between fragment isotopic content and collective velocity can be evidenced , also sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "increasing the impact parameter , fragmentation of the neck region , that is the overlap region between the two colliding nuclei , takes place .",
    "in this situation , corresponding to mid - peripheral events , fragment kinematical properties may keep a memory of the entrance channel .",
    "the presence of a density gradient between the dilute neck region and the remaining matter , projectile- and target - like fragments ( plf - tlf ) , induces interesting isospin effects : the imf s emerging from the neck region are more neutron rich and this isospin migration mechanism is sensitive to the symmetry energy . for more peripheral events",
    "one essentially observes a binary outcome , with the possibility of a dynamically induced fast fission , still triggered by the dynamics of the overlap zone . in reactions between systems with different initial",
    "n / z , isospin diffusion may occur through the low density interface , governed by the strength of the symmetry energy below saturation .    from one side ,",
    "these arguments lead us to single out the isospin signal as a good tracer of the reaction mechanism @xcite .",
    "in fact the new features appearing in neutron rich matter can be used to validate our current interpretation of the fragmentation mechanisms .",
    "one the other hand , isotopic properties and new correlations , once confronted with experimental data , can be used to probe the symmetry term of the eos at sub - saturation density .      in this subsection",
    "we focus on the mechanisms connected to isospin transport in binary events at fermi energies .",
    "we consider semi - peripheral reactions between systems having different n / z and we investigate the diffusion of the initial n / z gradient under the conditions dictated by the underlying dynamical evolution .",

    "the equilibration is larger ( r smaller ) both for lower energies ( right ) and for mi interactions ( dashed curves ) .",
    "in fact in both cases the reaction is slower and thus the interaction time longer , leading to more equilibration ; for the lower energy because of the slower speed , and for the mi interaction because of the less repulsive isoscalar mean field . in comparing the two iso - eos s",
    "we see that the equilibration is larger for the soft iso - eos , since the higher symmetry energy leads to a larger diffusion contribution to the isospin current .",
    "to isolate isospin effects , one could study the asymmetry imbalance ratio as a function of the interaction time ( or of an observable directly related to it ) .    to this purpose",
    "we propose to study the correlations between isospin equilibration and the kinetic energy loss , that is adopted as a selector of the reaction centrality and , hence , of the contact time @xmath130 .",

    "we mention that , according to its definition , the imbalance ratio does not change if one considers as observable @xmath126 , instead of the asymmetry of plf and tlf , other observables linearly correlated to it and more accessible from the experimental point of view , such as isoscaling coefficients , ratios of production of light isobars @xcite or isotopic content of light particle emission @xcite .",
    "an experimental study of isospin diffusion as a function of the dissipated kinetic energy has been recently performed by the indra collaboration @xcite .",
    "two systems , with the same projectile , @xmath142 , and two different targets ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) , at incident energies of 52 amev and 74 amev have been considered .",
    "this choice gives access to isospin effects in different conditions of charge ( and mass ) asymmetry , with respect to the analysis discussed in the previous sections , and to their evolution with the energy deposited into the system . in the symmetric ni + ni system",
    "isospin effects are essentially due to the pre - equilibrium emission . on the contrary , in the charge ( and mass )",
    "asymmetric reactions , one can observe isospin transport between the two partners , leading to the neutron enrichment of the plf . hence , in the following , we will focus on the plf properties .",
    "an isospin - dependent variable , correlated to the plf asymmetry , is constructed from the isotopically identifed particles emitted from the plf : @xmath144    where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are respectively the numbers of neutrons and protons bound in the particle @xmath147 , @xmath147 being d , t , @xmath148he , @xmath149he , @xmath150he , @xmath150li , @xmath151li , @xmath152li , @xmath153li , @xmath151be , @xmath153be , @xmath154be ; since neutrons are not measured free protons are excluded .",
    "@xmath155 is the number of events contained in a given bin of dissipated energy ( or kinetic energy loss ) , that is used as a selector of the reaction centrality .",
    "simulations have been carried out considering two parametrizations of the symmetry energy : asy - soft and asy - stiff .",
    "results are presented in fig.[figure1_emma ] , that shows the evolution of the n / z ratio of the plf , @xmath156 , as a function of @xmath157 one can see that n / z increases with the centrality of the collision for the two systems and the two beam energies . for the ni+ni system",
    "the variation of n / z with centrality is small , and attributed to pre - equilibrium emission .",
    "indeed , for this system with a small neutron excess , more protons are emitted during the pre - equilibrium stage , especially in the asy - stiff case , due to the coupled effect of coulomb repulsion and a less attractive symmetry potential for protons .",
    "this effect increases with the incident energy . on the contrary , the asy - soft case tends to emit more preequilibrium neutrons leading to a lower n / z ratio @xcite .",
    "the evolution with centrality is much more pronounced for the neutron - rich and asymmetric ni+au system .",
    "in addition to pre - equilibrium effects , isospin transport takes place between the two partners of the collision , and increases with the violence of the collision , more for asy - soft .",
    "it must be underlined that isospin equilibration is nearly reached , for the most central collision , at the lower energy for the asy - soft eos . however , when comparing diffusion effects corresponding to different iso - eos parametrizations , one should keep in mind that the isotopic content of the pre - equilibrium emission is also dependent on the iso - eos . in the asysoft case , for instance ,",
    "isospin diffusion is more effective but , at the same time , more neutrons are removed from the system by fast nucleon emission . in the mixed reaction , this reduces the sensitivity of the plf asymmetry to the iso - eos .",
    "the same arguments hold for the comparison of results obtained at two different beam energies .",
    "in fact , pre - equilibrium emission is more abundant at higher energy .",
    "isospin transport effects would be isolated by constructing imbalance ratios , as discussed before .",
    "however , such analysis is not possible for this set of data .    in figure [ figure1_emma ]",
    "are also plotted the results concerning the variable @xmath158 , calculated after de - exciting the hot primary plf s with the help of the simon code @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath158 are always smaller and the evolution with dissipation is generally flatter than that of the n / z of the primary plf : secondary decay weakens the isospin effects .",
    "however , @xmath158 , which appears in the simulations to be linearly correlated with the n / z of the primary plf , is thus a good indicator of isospin transport effects and is sensitive to the iso - eos .",
    "moreover , this observable can be directly compared to experimental data .",
    "this is shown in fig.[figure2_emma ] .",
    "open points show the values obtained forward in the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) frame . in this case",
    "mid - rapidity particles and those coming from the plf de - excitation are mixed up .",
    "full points in fig.[figure2_emma ] are related to the values of @xmath158 forward in the plf frame .",
    "they are representative of the isotopic content of the particles emitted from the plf only and can be compared with the results of the simulation , displayed in fig.[figure2_emma ] by the lines . when looking globally at the results for the four cases treated here , the agreement is better when the asy - stiff eos is used , i.e. a linear increase of the potential term of the symmetry energy around normal density .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the conclusion drawn from isospin diffusion in sn+sn systems at 50 amev,@xcite see before , and matches the one derived from the competition between dissipative mechanisms for ca+ca , ti at 25 amev @xcite .",
    "the study of isospin effects in central collisions and , in particular , of the isospin distillation mechanism is interesting also in a more general context : in heavy ion collisions the dilute phase appears during the expansion of the interacting matter .",
    "thus one can investigate effects of the coupling of expansion , fragmentation and distillation in a two - component ( neutron - proton ) system @xcite . in the following",
    "we will discuss correlations between the isotopic content of imf s and kinematical properties in central multifragmentation reactions .",
    "fragmentation originates from the break - up of a composite source that expands with a given velocity field .",
    "since neutrons and protons experience different forces , one may expect a different radial flow for the two species .",
    "being these forces connected to the density dependence of the symmetry energy , one should be able to extract information on its properties .",
    "such analysis is , in a way , complementary to the study of the isospin content of pre - equilibrium nucleon emission @xcite , because it looks at the same phenomenon from the point of view of the fragmenting residual system .",
    "in fact , we will see that the behaviour is often the opposite of the one observed for the pre - equilibrium emission .",
    "we will focus on central collisions , @xmath159 , in symmetric reactions between systems having three different initial asymmetries : @xmath160 and @xmath161 with @xmath162 = 1.24 , 1.48 and 1.64 , respectively .",

    "the features discussed above are determined mainly by the isoscalar part of the equation of state , on top of which the symmetry energy may induce minor changes .",
    "this explains the tiny difference between the two iso - eos . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties related to the fragment isotopic content are directly influenced by the symmetry energy term .",
    "we have extended our investigation to this observable studying its dependence on the imf position in hierarchy , as well its correlation to transverse velocity , similarly to the analysis done for central collisions ( see previous section ) . in fig.[iso13](a ) , upper panel for asysoft eos and bottom panel for asystiff eos , we report the asymmetry @xmath216 distribution of each imf of the hierarchy .",

    "the isospin distributions are centered at lower values and have rather narrow widths , quite insensitive to the position in hierarchy . at variance , for asystiff",
    "eos the centroids of the distributions are closer to the initial value of the composite system and their broader widths depend on the rank in the mass hierarchy . for both equations of state",
    "the lightest imfs are more likely to acquire higher values of asymmetry pointing towards different production mechanisms or formation conditions .",
    "we relate these features to the differences between the behavior of the two iso - eos at subsaturation densities . clearly , larger values of the symmetry energy ( asysoft case ) fasten the isospin distillation process and all imf s reach closer isospin values . on the other hand , for asystiff eos fragments grow in low density , more charge asymmetric domains , as a result of isospin migration towards the neck .",
    "the differences inside the hierarchy in this case point towards different formation time scales with the lightest imf finding a neutron rich environment , being the distillation process not efficient enough to lower the isotopic content of all imf s in the event .",
    "if they have lower transverse velocity , remaining longer in a neutron - richer region , they will carry higher asymmetry .",
    "the average fragment asymmetry , as a function of the transverse velocity , is shown in fig.[iso13 ] @xmath218 , upper asysoft and bottom asystiff eos .",
    "a decreasing trend is manifest for all imf s , more pronounced for the latter choice . in this case , for a given transverse velocity bin the asymmetry always increases with the rank in hierarchy .",
    "these observations open new opportunities also from the experimental point of view .",
    "an analysis of isospin dependent observables in correlation to the position in mass hierarchy or kinematic observables can add new constrains on the behavior of the symmetry energy below normal density and provide indications about the formation of imfs in the low density and heated overlapping region at these impact parameters .",
    "recent experimental results reported by the chimera collaboration for the system @xmath206 at a lower energy ( @xmath110 ) @xcite suggest the existence of the hierarchy in transverse velocity , as discussed here . in these experiments",
    "it was also found that the lightest fragments are more asymmetric .",
    "this sensitivity to the rank in the hierarchy can then be related to a asystiff - like behavior of the symmetry energy at sub - saturation densities .",
    "at higher energies , where suprasaturation densities will be probed , all the observables under investigation are more affected by the momentum dependence ( md ) of the mean fields .",

    "eq.([relesym ] ) can be strictly derived only in rmft , but for our purpose the key point is that @xmath9 arises from a competition of two fields , one scalar and one vector , that at @xmath256 are of the order of @xmath257 mev , as is shown in fig.[esymrel ] ( left panel ) for a standard non - linear ( nl)-rmft model @xcite . since the attractive @xmath258-contribution is proportional to the scalar density , reduced by a factor @xmath259 respect to the baryon density , the net effect will be a faster increase of the potential part of the symmetry energy at high densities @xcite , as shown in the right panel of fig.[esymrel ] .",

    "we work within a relativistic transport frame , beyond the cascade picture , consistently derived from effective lagrangians , where isospin effects are accounted for in the mean field and collision terms .",

    "the reason is twofold .",
    "kaons have a higher threshold energy , hence they are produced only in the high density phase .",

    "the point is that in the non - equilibrium case of a heavy ion collision the asymmetry of the source where kaons are produced is in fact reduced by the @xmath288 `` transformation '' , due to the favored @xmath289 processes .",

    "moreover a recent transport evaluation of the @xmath291 ratio , also in a non - relativistic frame , is reaching just opposite conclusions @xcite .",
    "the effect described in ref.@xcite essentially is due to the fact that a stiff @xmath9 causes a neutron - rich emission of nucleons in the early stages of the reaction leaving the system too symmetric in isospin content to reproduce the @xmath267 ratio of fopi . on the other hand , if one employs an @xmath269 that just above @xmath31 decreases with density generating an isospin force that is attractive for the neutrons it is possible to get close to the data , see fig.[mesonbeamen ] ( right ) .",
    "however , we note that it is mandatory to check if one can reproduce at the same time the @xmath39 emission as a function of @xmath64 especially at the high @xmath64 relevant for pion production , since this represents the complementary signal for the soft @xmath9 , see sect.5",
    ". this would be a first test of the claim for a very soft @xmath9 and in case of failure it will provide evidence that there are other mechanism determining the in - medium meson production .",
    "indeed , we already know that there are at least other three effects competing with the mean field effect on the @xmath39 emission .",
    "these are the so - called `` threshold effect '' emphasized by the calculation of ref.s @xcite , the momentum dependence of the isospin - dependent cross sections , and the the isospin mass shift of pions due to the coupling to @xmath292hole excitation@xcite .",
    "these will be discussed in the next subsection ..    we finally note that a decreasing symmetry term at high density , becoming even negative above @xmath293 , implies more fundamental problems for the stability of a dense isospin asymmetric matter .",
    "we can have a collapse as well as @xmath39 separation instabilities , since the isovector landau parameter can reach large negative values @xcite .",
    "no evidence of such effects is present in compact stars as well as in heavy ion collisions .",
    "there are circumstantial reasons to be careful .",
    "indeed , the physics involved in the in - medium particle production has many aspects and a comprehensive and self - consistent approach is necessary before extracting the isospin dependence of the interaction .",
    "the `` threshold effect '' is due to the fact that the masses of nucleons and delta s are modified in the medium .",
    "the unknown self - energies of the delta s are usually specified in terms of the neutron and proton ones by the use of clebsch - gordon coefficients for the isospin coupling of the @xmath281 to nucleons @xcite .",
    "these medium modifications are isospin dependent , eq.([iso - selfene ] ) .",
    "this influences the phase - space available for meson production in a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collision because it modifies the difference between the invariant energy in the entrance channel @xmath294 with respect to the production threshold @xmath295 .",
    "this effect is , of course , present in general for all meson productions , but for brevity we concentrate here on one inelastic channel : @xmath296 , mainly responsible for @xmath297 production . from eq.([eff - mass ] ) the invariant energy in the entrance channel and the threshold energy are given , respectively , by    @xmath298\\stackrel{p=0 } { \\rightarrow}\\left[m^{*}_{n } + \\sigma^{0}_{\\omega}+\\sigma^{0}_{\\rho}+\\sigma_{\\delta}\\right]>m^{*}_{n}+ \\sigma^{0}_{\\omega } \\nonumber\\\\ \\sqrt{s_{th}}= \\left[m^{*}_{p}+m^{*}_{\\delta^-}+\\sigma_{0}(p)+\\sigma_{0 } ( \\delta^-)\\right]= \\left[m^{*}_{n}+m^{*}_{\\delta}+2 \\sigma_{\\omega } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath299 are the isospin averaged values .",
    "the last equality for the threshold energy is valid due to the prescription for the delta self - energies , which leads to an exact compensation of the isospin - dependent parts , hence the threshold @xmath295 is not modified by isospin dependent self - energies . in general in a self - consistent many - body calculation",
    "higher order effects can destroy this exact balance .",
    "but this is not so important for our qualitative discussion , since there will always be a compensating effect in @xmath295 .",
    "on the other hand , the energy available in the entrance channel , @xmath294 , is shifted in an explicitely isospin dependent way by the in - medium self - energy @xmath300 .",
    "especially , the vector self - energy gives a positive contribution to neutrons that increases the difference @xmath301 and hence increases the cross section of the inelastic process due to the opening up of the phase - space , expecially close to threshold , since the intermediate @xmath302 resonance will be better probed .",
    "a similar modification but opposite in sign is present in @xmath301 for the @xmath303 channel that therefore is suppressed by the isospin effect on the self - energies .",
    "hence , due to the described threshold effect the ratio @xmath304 increases with the stiffness of @xmath9 which is associated with a large @xmath305 .",
    "this is at the origin of the result in fig.[mesonbeamen](left ) .",
    "of course , the rbuu calculation contains also isospin contributions in the mean field but the final result appears to be dominated by the threshold effect , in particular at lower energies .",
    "however there are at least two other physical aspects that have to be considered .",
    "one is the fact that the self - energies in the implementation of rbuu are not explicitly momentum dependent as in dbhf and as the study of the optical potential shows .",
    "thus we return to the importance of the isospin momentum dependence discussed in sect.5 . because we neglect the dependence of the self - energies on momentum , the difference @xmath301 in eq.([threshold ] ) increases strongly with the momentum @xmath59 . the problem is directly related to the strong energy dependence of the optical potential in rmft .",
    "therefore it is likely that a more realistic calculation which includes a @xmath306 will reduce the effect seen in fig.[mesonbeamen ] . in addition",
    "a fully consistent treatment should include an optical potential also for the pions .",
    "it can be envisaged that a stronger sensitivity to @xmath307 can be seen looking at @xmath304 as a function of the pion transverse energy .",
    "furthermore in a fully self consistent many - body calculation the @xmath308 s will affect also the isospin dependence of the cross sections for inelastic processes .",
    "another effect that is certainly present is the modification of the pion spectral function which in an asymmetric medium becomes isospin dependent .",
    "this has been recently pointed out in ref.@xcite using a pion interaction in the nuclear medium given by chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the effect seems to go in the direction of smaller @xmath267 ratios",

    "we have a unique fermi distribution and from a simple fit we can evaluate the local temperature ( black numbers in mev ) .",

    "this seems to be a very appealing physics program for the new facilities , fair at gsi - darmstadt @xcite and nica at jinr - dubna @xcite , where heavy ion beams ( even unstable , with large isospin asymmetry ) will be available with good intensities in the 1 - 30 agev energy region .",
    "the weak point of those predictions is the lack of a reliable equation of state that can describe with the same confidence the two phases , hadronic and deconfined . on the other hand",
    "this also represents a strong theory motivation to work on more refined effective theories for a strong interacting matter .",
    "a nice qualitative argument in favor of noticeable isospin effects on the hadron - quark transition at high density can be derived from the fig.[isoparton ] , where we compare typical equations of state ( eos ) for hadron ( nucleon ) and quark matter , at zero temperature , for symmetric ( @xmath320 ) and neutron matter ( @xmath321 ) , where @xmath322 are the neutron / proton densities and @xmath323 the total baryon density . for the hadron part",

    "we see that such crossing for symmetric matter ( @xmath330 ) is located at rather high density , @xmath331 , while for pure neutron matter ( @xmath332 ) it is moving down to @xmath333 .",
    "of course fig.[isoparton ] represents just a simple energetic argument to support the hadron - quark transition to occur at lower baryon densities for more isospin asymmetric matter . in the following",
    "we will rigourously consider the case of a first order phase transition in the gibbs frame for a system with two conserved charges ( baryon and isospin ) , in order to derive more detailed results .",
    "since the first order phase transition presents a jump in the energy , we can expect the mixed phase to start at densities even before the crossing points of the fig.1 .",
    "the lower boundary then can be predicted at relatively low baryon densities for asymmetric matter , likely reached in relativistic heavy ion collisions and in compact stars .",
    "in fact this point is certainly of interest for the structure of the crust and the inner core of neutron stars ( ns ) , e.g. see refs . @xcite and the review @xcite .",
    "we like to mention a very recent estimation of the ns mass - radius correlation ( @xmath334 ) with high confidence level , that could indicate a transition to quark matter in the inner core @xcite .",
    "we finally note that the above conclusions are rather independent on the isoscalar part of the used hadron eos at high density , that is chosen to be rather soft in agreement with collective flow and kaon production data @xcite .    in the used bag model",
    "no gluon interactions , the @xmath335-strong coupling parameter , are included .",

    "we can study in detail the isospin dependence of the transition densities @xcite .",
    "the structure of the mixed phase is obtained by imposing the gibbs conditions @xcite for chemical potentials and pressure and by requiring the conservation of the total baryon and isospin densities :    @xmath336    where @xmath337 is the fraction of quark matter in the mixed phase and t is the temperature .",

    "we finally remark that at higher temperature and smaller baryon chemical potential ( ultrarelativistic collisions ) the isospin effects discussed here are expected to vanish @xcite , even if other physics can enter the game and charge asymmetry effects are predicted also at @xmath375 and @xmath376 @xcite .      from the above discussion",
    "it clearly appears that the lack of explicit isovector interactions in the quark sector could strongly affect the location of the phase transition in asymmetric matter and the related expected observables .",

    ".    however such isospin mixing effect results in a very small variation of the symmetry energy in the quark phase , still related only to the fermi kinetic contribution .",
    "in fact this represents just a very first step towards a more complete treatment of isovector interactions in effective quark models , of large interest for the discussion of the phase transition at high densities .",
    "we remind that confinement is still missing in these mean field approaches .",
    "more generally starting from the qcd lagrangian one can arrive to an effective color current - current interaction where an expansion in various components can provide isovector contributions @xcite .",
    "we also notice the evidence that chiral symmetry restoration is favored in systems with large neutron excess @xcite .    a very interesting point has been recently suggested about the possibility of a quark matter formed in a color superconducting state @xcite .",
    "a strong symmetry repulsion comes from the fact that equal densities of up and down quarks are energetic favored to allow the formation of a diquark condensate",
    ". this will be in competition with a decreasing of the diquark pairing at large isospin asymmetries .",
    "exciting new perspectives are open up .    in conclusion",
    "the aim of this project is twofold :    * to stimulate new experiments on isospin effects in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies ( in a few @xmath2 range ) with attention to the isospin content of produced particles and to elliptic flow properties , in particular for high-@xmath64 selections . * to stimulate more refined models of effective lagrangians for non - perturbative qcd , where isovector channels are consistently accounted for .",
    "we have shown how dissipative heavy ion collisions with charge asymmetric isotopes provide a valuable , in fact unique , tool to extend our knowledge of the nuclear matter phase diagram along the `` third '' isovector component , @xmath394 . due to the low asymmetries reached in terrestrial laboratories , even with unstable beams ,",
    "it is difficult to disentangle density and momentum dependence of the in - medium symmetry potentials from the corresponding properties of the isoscalar interactions . therefore our discussion has been mainly focused on exclusive experiments , where suitable correlations can better isolate isovector effects .",
    "the fundamental microscopic tool to relate isospin properties of the reaction products to the underlying interaction is the transport theory to describe the evolution of the reaction dynamics .",
    "we must remark that isoscalar global properties of the collision dynamics ( like stopping power and density variations , pre - equilibrium emissions and main reaction mechanisms ) should be correctly reproduced otherwise also the isovector predictions will be not fully reliable .",
    "we remind that one of the most important information is about the density dependence of the symmetry energy away from saturation .",
    "this is in fact a basic requirement for a comparison of different transport models .",
    "we have used a non - relativistic and relativistic stochastic mean field approach . in this way we can account for the very important mean field dynamics coupled to fluctuation terms that can lead to fragment formation in mechanical / chemical unstable regions , and in general to the onset of various other instabilities , as well as to the widths in the distributions of the measured quantities .",
