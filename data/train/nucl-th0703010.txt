    "traditionally the ( semi ) phenomenological high precision two - nucleon ( nn)potentials av18 @xcite , cd bonn @xcite and nijm i , ii @xcite go together with the nonrelativistic operator for the kinetic energy @xmath2 in the nn c.m.system .",
    "nevertheless , as is well known , this nonrelativistic schrdinger equation @xmath3 can be related to an underlying relativistic nn schrdinger equation @xmath4 by a simple algebraic step@xcite,@xcite .",
    "applying @xmath5 to ( [ 2 ] ) from the left one obtains @xmath6 which can be identically rewritten into ( [ 1 ] ) if one defines @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "( we use @xmath9 in order to distinguish the momentum operator from the number @xmath10 ) . therefore adjusting @xmath11 in ( [ 1 ] ) to the nn phase shift and mixing parameters from a phase shift analysis and relating the c.m .",
    "momentum @xmath12 to the lorentz invariant lab energy @xmath13 via @xmath14 ( a relation identically valid for relativistic and nonrelativistic kinematics ) one has in fact solved a relativistic equation .",
    "we also see that @xmath15 equals @xmath16 .the question remains , what is @xmath17 given @xmath18 ?",
    "the formal solution of that quadratic equation ( [ 4 ] ) is @xmath19 why is @xmath17 of interest ?",
    "if one turns to the 3n system and would like to investigate relativistic effects @xcite,@xcite the knowledge of @xmath17 is very useful .",
    "it defines together with the relativistic kinetic energy the interacting nn mass operator , which is a key ingredient for building the interactive 3n mass operator @xcite .",
    "therefore we focus in this paper on the determination of @xmath20 related to the high precision nn potentials via ( [ 4 ] ) or ( [ 6 ] ) .    in @xcite,@xcite",
    "a potential @xmath20 has been determined directly fitting ( [ 2 ] ) to nn phase shifts .",
    "thereby the urbana @xmath21 potential has been readjusted achieving a fair fit ( though not of the quality of the high precision potentials ) . in @xcite a momentum scale transformation",
    "@xmath22 has been introduced which provides an analytical relation between @xmath11 and @xmath20 and guarantees that the s - matrix related to ( [ 1 ] ) at c.m.momentum k equals the s - matrix related to ( [ 2 ] ) at c.m .",
    "momentum q. in other words the relativistic and nonrelativistic s - matrices agree at the same energy .",
    "this , however , is misleading since the equality of the two s - matrices should hold at the same c.m.momenta @xcite . a better , though still approximate approach to relate @xmath11 and @xmath20 has been given in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand there is the possibility to add an interaction to the square of the free nn mass operator @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 has exactly the same form as ( [ 1 ] ) with @xmath25 provided we identify @xmath26 with the mass operator of the interacting nn system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is of course also obvious from the relations ( [ 1 ] ) - ( [ 4 ] ) . the construction of the relativistic 3n hamiltonian requires , however , the 3n mass operator @xmath27 rather than its square .",
    "therefore our aim here is to solve ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) exactly for @xmath20 .",
    "this is outlaid in section ii .",
    "the validity of the resulting @xmath20 is verified by demonstrating that it provides exactly the same phase shift parameters using ( [ 2 ] ) as the underlying @xmath11 using ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "next we regard the 3n mass operator where nn c.m .",
    "forces enter in the form @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 the total nn momentum .",
    "the @xmath29-dependence arises since in a 3-body system the nn subsystems are not at rest . in section iii",
    "we propose a simple manner to determine @xmath30 in a numerical precise way .",
    "this opens now the door to use @xmath31 which are equivalent to the underlying high precision potentials in a relativistic context in 3n bound and scattering problems .",
    "we summarize in section iv .",
    "a technical derivation is given in the appendix .",

    "one can proceed in close analogy to the representation derived in @xcite for @xmath30 given in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we regard a specific partial wave state ( or coupled ones ) with given orbital angular momentum(a ) , total spin and total angular momentum . for the sake of a simpler notation",
    "we will not show these quantum numbers explicitely . using the completeness relation of bound and scattering states for the potential @xmath18 one obtains @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the nonrelativistic deuteron wave function of ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath35 the mass of the deuteron .",
    "here we introduced a different definition of the binding energy , namely an implicit one : @xmath36 in lowest order it agrees with the usual one @xmath37 .",
    "this new definition of the binding energy has in addition the feature that it can naturally be written as @xmath38 in agreement with the form of the energy eigenvalue of ( [ 1 ] ) at the bound state pole @xmath39 of the s - matrix .",
