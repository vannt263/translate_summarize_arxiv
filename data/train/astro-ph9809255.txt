    "gravitational instability is commonly accepted as the basic mechanism for structure formation on large scales . combined with the cdm model it leads to the picture of hierarchical clustering with wide support from deep galaxy and cluster observations . during the recent phase of cosmic evolution groups and clusters of galaxies condense from large scale density enhancements , and they grow by accretion and merger processes of the environmental cosmic matter .",
    "we expect traces of such recent formation processes still in presently observed objects , such as deviations from virial equilibrium , eccentric shapes , and substructures .",
    "x - ray observations of clusters show a large variety of morphologies which hopefully could discriminate between different cosmologies ( mohr 1995 ) . in low @xmath0 universes structure formation",
    "ceases at earlier times compared to cosmological models with a higher value for the density parameter . in the contrary ,",
    "recent simulations show a remarkable similarity of internal structures as the average density profile when they are compared at rescaled radii normalized to a typical scale as the virial radius ( jing 1995 , thomas 1997 ) . for these analysis",
    "they concentrate on a sample of isolated clusters in high resolution cosmological simulations which emphasizes the relaxed structure found . in the contrary",
    ", we intend to concentrate on the appearance and the clustering of a sample of simulated clusters showing evidence of perturbations and interaction .",
    "we discuss cluster formation using dissipationless @xmath1-body simulations of variants of the cdm  model with different cosmological parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3  , where @xmath4  is the hubble parameter in units of 100  .",
    "our goal is to interpret the simulated data of the structure and spatial distribution of groups and clusters which can discriminate between the models , and which can also help to get an understanding of the physics underlying the formation of these objects .",
    "one of the critical questions in @xmath1-body simulations is the identification of groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "there are several methods such as the standard friends - of - friends algorithm ( fof ) introduced by davis  ( 1985 ) , the spherical overdensity method described by lacey  &  cole  ( 1994 ) or more refined algorithm just as the denmax procedure ( gelb & bertschinger 1994 ) or the hierarchical fof group finding ( klypin 1997 ) .",
    "but it is by no means clear which of these methods best fits the observational procedures for identifying groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "we decided to use the standard fof group finder because this algorithm picks up particle groups without preferring any special geometry .",
    "additionally we adopted the virial theorem : particle groups that do not obey this relation are investigated in detail .",
    "visual inspection of such objects often shows the fof group finder s tendency to link separate groups by small bridges , and groupings of particles with strongly discordant velocities . quantifying their number and specifics helps in understanding some of the most impressive objects in the large scale matter distribution of the universe",
    ". we should remark that among the unvirialized groups , there exists a number of low mass badly resolved objects which are not of interest in this study .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we specify the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "next we discuss the cluster halos and their properties . in section 4",
    "we study the spatial clustering of the different groups .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our main results .",
    "we base our analysis on four cosmological models all with an amplitude as measured by the 4-year cobe experiment , cf .",
    "bunn & white ( 1997 ) .",
    "first we take the standard cdm - model , with critical mass density @xmath5 and a dimensionless hubble constant @xmath6 , which is used as a reference in spite of the difficulty in reproducing both large and small scale clustering .",
    "more realistic variants of the cdm model have a lower matter content , as @xmath7cdm and ocdm1 , which both have @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . for these models",
    "the shape parameter of the power spectrum @xmath10 better fits the constraints from galaxy and cluster clustering , ( e.g. peacock & dodds 1996 , einasto 1998 ) .",
    "the models were normalized to the full 4-year cobe signal using the boltzmann code cmbfast developed by seljak & zaldarriaga ( 1996 ) and assuming a baryon content of @xmath11 suggested by big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the mass variance of the linear input spectrum at a scale of @xmath12mpc is given by @xmath13 .",
    "finally we used a less extreme open model ocdm2 with @xmath14 which promises realistic large scale galaxy clustering and has the same mass variance at @xmath12mpc as galaxies .",
    "the information about the models can be found in table  [ parameter ] .",
    ".physical properties of the numerical simulations .",
    "the box size  @xmath15 is given in  @xmath16mpc , the particle mass  @xmath17 in units of @xmath18 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ ximass ] we demonstrate the strong dependence of the amplitude of the correlation function on the mass cuts .",
    "high mass halos mark high density maxima in the dark matter distribution which are stronger clustered ( kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "the slope remains almost unchanged .",
    "due to the smallness of the simulation box it is difficult to compare with the correlation function of rich clusters of galaxies which are identified with halos of mass larger than @xmath19 .",
    "it is interesting that the bound halos in the scdm model have the lowest amplitude among all models .",
    "this is connected with the high evolution stage of this model where very big halos form which include most of the matter in the simulation box , and on the other hand with the small power of scdm at large with respect to small scales , this being related to the high value of @xmath20 .",
    "observations lead to a preferred value of @xmath21 ( peacock & dodds 1996 ) .",
    "( 9.5,5 . )",
    "( -0.26,-3 ) = 9.5 cm    but most interesting is the correlation function of the unvirialized particle groups .",
    "they are much more strongly clustered than virialized objects , and the slope is very steep , @xmath22 , independent of the cosmological model , cf .",
    "table  [ xiparam ] .",
    "this verifies that mergers are occurring at particular places in the universe , and that these processes are highly correlated . this can be checked in fig .",
    "[ slice ] .",
    "we have plotted a slice through the @xmath7cdm simulation and marked the places where unvirialized objects have been identified with circles .",
    "these objects are found preferably in high density regions whereas virialized halos trace the overall large scale structure of the universe .",
    "nowadays it seems clear that strong interactions and mergers are the trigger for producing the most luminous infrared galaxies .",
    "so an enhanced clustering has been obtained for luminous infrared galaxies ( bouchet 1993 ) .",
    "more luminous iras galaxies , basically mergers , are more strongly correlated , and ultraluminous mergers have strongest correlation strength ( gao 1993 )",
    ". these luminous infrared galaxies may represent an important stage in the formation of qso s and a primary stage in the formation of elliptical galaxies cores . and",
    "as we have found , these objects form at special places in the universe where the most massive galaxy clusters are found .",
    "we have collected a number of reasons for looking at virialisation as a reasonable criterion for identifying groups and clusters of galaxies in numerical simulations .",
    "the virial theorem well described an overwhelming majority of the halos in our simulations .",
    "a slight bend in the virial relation can be ascribed to the effective pressure of the permanent spherical accretion stream in the halos .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the unvirialized halos .",
    "we have shown that they are characterized by quite recent soft mergers which lead to more anisotropic halos and are strongly correlated over scales of up to 40 .",
    "this is confirmed by the result obtained for luminous infrared galaxies . in our simulations",
    "we find a very fast virialisation of the halos which leads to the small percentage of such objects at any given time .",
    "but the virialisation itself was not a basic goal of our simulations .",
    "it must be checked whether this time depends on the relatively low mass resolution in our big simulation boxes .",
    "the scdm model is found to have the largest evolution rate of the halo abundance to @xmath23 , and has the largest percentage of unvirialized objects . on the contrary ,",
    "the more realistic @xmath7cdm and ocdm2 models have a quite small number of recent mergers .",
    "the stronger anisotropy of the merger products leads to typical triaxial ellipsoids with axis ratios of 1:0.4:0.3 which represents an measurable effect in large cluster samples .",
    "the merging processes are characterized by basically central encounters .",
    "not much angular momentum is transferred to the merger product which leads to a self - similar growth of the rotation of the halos , ( e.g. knebe 1998 ) .",
    "we are grateful to h. couchman for making his numerical code public .",
    "also we acknowledge the use of cmbfast provided by u. seljak and m. zaldarriaga .",
    "we are glad about useful and encouraging discussions with j. colberg .",
    "s. gottlber and d. woods read carefully the manuscript and made valuable comments ."
