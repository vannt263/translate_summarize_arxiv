    "a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the dynamics of strongly coupled gauge theories , and it has been also further extended to cover topics related to the condensed matter theory @xcite . in this context , the solutions of einstein - maxwell - dilaton theories have been frequently employed to address the states of underlying field theory . however , since such charged solutions are translational invariant , a small perturbation such as turning on an electric field , could result in an infinite dc conductivity .",
    "it is obvious that such a model can not present a realistic description of aforementioned systems and it is argued that momentum must be relaxed in these kinds of theories to avoid such a strange behavior .",
    "this can be done , for example , by breaking the translational invariance property @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "andrade and withers presented a simple holographic model for momentum relaxation @xcite .",
    "their model consists of einstein - maxwell theory in ( @xmath5)-dimensional bulk space together with @xmath6 massless scalar fields .",
    "the neutral scalar fields in the bulk theory are dual to some specific operators with spatially dependent sources and , in principle , these spatial sources can be chosen in a way that the bulk stress tensor and hence , the resulting black brane geometry are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "momentum relaxation concept is realized through these spatially dependent sources .",
    "+ scalar fields lead to deformed state at the cft side and different aspects of this deformation have been considered in several papers , _",
    "e.g. _ , some non - local measures of entanglement in such a model have been recently studied in @xcite via the holographic methods .",
    "+ in this paper , we use this model and investigate the effect of including higher - order curvature terms in the gravitational action on holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) ; in this direction , we also study the mutual and tripartite information . in the holographic models , considering higher - curvature terms in the gravity action",
    "is well motivated for reasons ; in particular , addressing different types of central charges could be an example @xcite .",
    "however , in general , higher - derivative terms could potentially introduce ghost degrees of freedom , but it is known that a special combination of curvature squared terms , namely the einstein gauss - bonnet ( gb ) theory leads to second order equations of motion and the theory is free of ghosts .",
    "holographically , gb term plays the role of leading - order corrections to the einstein gravity and in the context of ads / cft , gb background is dual to a theory with different central charges , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath7 and @xmath8 functions @xcite . in the model considered in this work ,",
    "the gravitational action contains five - dimensional gb term together with three specific spatially dependent massless scalar fields , and we are going to study the change of hee for strip entangling region due to these corrections .    to compute hee in the einstein s theory of gravity , there is an elegant proposal made by ryu and takayanagi ( rt ) @xcite . according to the rt proposal , for a definite entangling region in the boundary ,",
    "the entanglement entropy is related to the minimal surface in the bulk whose boundary coincides with the boundary of the entangling region .",

    "therefore , in order to compute hee in the semi - classical regime when some higher - order derivative terms are added into the einstein gravity , rt proposal should be replaced by some other recipes @xcite . some related works in this subject can also be found , for example in @xcite and references therein .    in this paper , we will follow the proposal of @xcite to study the hee which will be the subject of section 2",

    "this quantity similar to other non - local quantities , _",
    "e.g. _ , wilson loop and correlation functions , can also be used to classify the various quantum phase transitions and critical points of a given system @xcite .",
    "+ to define entanglement entropy in its spatial ( or geometric ) description , let us divide a constant time slice into two spatial regions @xmath9 and @xmath10 where they are complement to each other .",
    "thus , the corresponding total hilbert space can be written in a specific partitioning as @xmath11 . by integrating out the degrees of freedom that live in the complement of @xmath9 , the reduced density matrix for region",
    "@xmath9 can be computed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total density matrix .",
    "the entanglement entropy is given by the von - neumann formula for this reduced density matrix as follows @xmath14 for local @xmath15-dimensional quantum field theories , entanglement entropy follows the area law and it is infinite ; the structure of the infinite terms are generally as follows @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the uv cutoff , @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the area and volume of the entangling region in the boundary , @xmath20 is the finite part of entropy and @xmath21 are local and extensive functions on the boundary of entangling region , which are homogeneous of degree @xmath22 .",
    "the coefficient of the most divergent term is proportional to the area of the entangling surface and this is indeed the area law which is due to the infinite correlations between degrees of freedom near the boundary of entangling surface .",
    "the coefficients of infinite terms are not physical whereas the coefficient of logarithmic term is physical and universal in a sense that it is not affected by cutoff redefinitions .",
    "although computing the entanglement entropy in the context of field theory is indeed a difficult task , thanks to the ads / cft correspondence one can use rt proposal to find hee , as mentioned in the introduction ; this proposal defines hee in terms of the minimal area of codimension two hypersurface in the bulk .",

    "we restrict our study to five - dimensional geometric background . in order to compute hee ,",
    "let us consider the following strip entangling region @xmath38 where we assume @xmath39 and @xmath40 plays an infrared regulator distance along the entangling surface .",

    "the gb gravity can indeed be obtained by setting @xmath50 in , where @xmath0 is a dimensionless coupling constant that controls the strength of the gb term .",
    "thus , the five - dimensional einstein - gb - scalar gravitational action with momentum relaxation is given by the following expression @xmath51.\\ ] ] the gb gravity in five dimensions is itself important because in a given background , its equations of motion for a propagating perturbation contain only two derivatives .",
    "+ the scalar fields are considered to be linearly dependent on spatial coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath52 such an ansatz for massless scalar sources , guarantees the solution to be homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "according to ads / cft dictionary , massless scalar fields are dual to marginal operators of the corresponding field theory .    the relevant equations of motion for can simply be obtained from and there is an asymptotically ads@xmath53 black brane solution as in which @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the horizon radius and the constants @xmath57 and @xmath58 satisfy the following relations @xmath59 it is noted that @xmath60 and the uv boundary is defined as @xmath61 and the temperature of black brane is given by @xmath62 there is an interesting feature for the momentum relaxation methods , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the zero temperature one gets @xmath63 , which is an extremal black brane .",
    "although there is no @xmath64 charge to produce an extremal black brane solution in this case , the momentum relaxation parameter gives us such feature similar to the case of rn - ads black brane .      in the model that we are considering",
    "there are two deformations in the field theory due to the momentum relaxation parameter and gb terms . in this section",
    ", we find the corrections to the entanglement entropy because of these two deformations .",
    "to compute the entanglement entropy in this setup , we will use and fix the coupling constants of higher - order terms according to five - dimensional gb gravity .",
    "therefore , the entropy functional reads as @xmath65 the next step is minimizing the entropy functional in order to find the profile of the hypersurface which has been parametrized by @xmath66 . it is noted that @xmath66 is supposed to be a smooth differentiable function with the condition @xmath67 . to proceed , one may consider the entropy functional as a one - dimensional action in which the corresponding lagrangian is independent of @xmath66 which leads to a conservation law .",
    "in other words , let us write as @xmath68 , thus the equation of motion becomes @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a constant which can be fixed by imposing the condition that at the turning point @xmath71 of the hypersurface in the bulk one has @xmath72 .",
    "after minimizing the functional of and using the condition of the hypersurface turning point , one gets the following conserved quantity along the radial profile @xmath73 in principle , the above equation allows us to find @xmath74 .",
    "in general , it is a difficult task to solve to find a proper profile since it is a cubic equation for @xmath74 .",
    "however , in some special cases , the semianalytic solutions might be obtained . in the following",
    "we will develop the behavior of hee of a cft whose states are in fact under the excitation of the both momentum relaxation and gb terms . up to the leading order of @xmath0 , and after making use of the following expression @xmath75 one obtains @xmath76 which can be inverted to find the turning point of the proposed hypersurface in the bulk as follows @xmath77 plugging the results into , one gets the hee as follows @xmath78 where @xmath17 stands for the uv scale which has been defined by the radial profile and @xmath79 the leading divergent term in is in fact the usual area law ; on the other hand , the logarithmic universal term in the hee is found as follows @xmath80 it is worth mentioning that for strip entangling region in cft@xmath81 , in principle , there is no such a logarithmic universal term in the hee .",
    "nevertheless , in @xcite it was observed that the universal term would appear due to momentum relaxation parameter . in our computation",
    ", the universal term is appeared as well and according to , it has either of increasing or decreasing behavior depending on the sign of gb coupling .    to end up this section",
    ", we would like to mention that by setting @xmath82 , the solution turns to the five - dimensional gb - ads black brane solution with a ricci - flat horizon which was found in @xcite . on the other hand , for low - excited state of cft and near the uv boundary ,",
    "reduces to @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be considered as an effective ads radius which is given by @xmath86 excited state due to such deformation in cft is called thermal excitation .",
    "thus , in particular , for the limit of @xmath87 , the change of entropy can be obtained via the following relation @xmath88 where @xmath89 , up to the leading order of gb coupling , is the integrand of entropy function in which @xmath90 has been replaced by @xmath91 . therefore , one obtains @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the hee for the vacuum case or pure ads , namely @xmath94 , and it is given by @xmath95 the above hee will reproduce the result in @xcite for low - thermal excitation due to the gb term .",
    "in addition to entanglement entropy , the @xmath96-partite information is another useful quantity developed in the framework of quantum information theory that has conquered the drawbacks of the entanglement entropy , namely the existence of uv cutoff in the expression of entanglement entropy . in the case of two and three entangling regions ,",
    "the @xmath96-partite information is equivalent to holographic mutual and tripartite information respectively which have their own characteristics as well ; namely , they are regarded as criterion that indicates the amount of shared information , or more precisely the correlation , between the entangling regions @xcite . concerning the peculiarities of holographic mutual and tripartite information ,",
