    "in his seminal work on szemerdi s theorem , gowers  @xcite introduced uniformity norms @xmath0 for each integer @xmath1 , now referred to as gowers norms or gowers uniformity norms , that have played an important role in the developments in additive combinatorics over the past ten years .",
    "in particular , green and tao  @xcite used gowers norms as a tool in their proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in the primes ; shortly thereafter , they made a conjecture  @xcite , the inverse conjecture for the gowers norms , on the algebraic structures underlying these norms .",
    "related seminorms were introduced by the authors  @xcite in the setting of ergodic theory , and the ergodic structure theorem provided a source of motivation in the formulation of the inverse conjecture . for each integer @xmath1 and @xmath2 ,",
    "green and tao introduce a class @xmath3 of `` @xmath4-step nilsequences of bounded complexity , '' which we do not define here , and the proof of the inverse conjecture was given :    [ th : inverse ] for each integer @xmath1 and @xmath2 , there exists a constant @xmath5 such that for every function @xmath6 on @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , there exists @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "see also szegedy s approach to the inverse conjecture , outlined in the announcement  @xcite for the article  @xcite .",
    "we are motivated by the work of gowers in  @xcite .",
    "several ideas come out of this work , in particular the motivation that algebra norms are easier to study .",
    "the gowers norms @xmath0 are classically defined in @xmath7 , but we choose to work in a general compact abelian group . for most of the results presented here ,",
    "we take care to distinguish between the group @xmath7 and the interval @xmath12 $ ] , of the natural numbers @xmath13 , whereas for applications in additive combinatorics , the results may be more directly proved without this separation .",
    "this is a conscious choice that allows us to separate what about gowers norms is particular to the combinatorics of @xmath7 and what is more general .",
    "our point of view is that of harmonic analysis , rather than combinatorial .",
    "more generally , the gowers norms can be defined on a nilmanifold .",
    "this is particularly important in the ergodic setting where analogous seminorms were defined by the authors in  @xcite in an arbitrary measure space ; these seminorms are exactly norms when the space is a nilmanifold .",
    "while we restrict ourselves to abelian groups in this article , most of the results can be carried out in the more general setting of a nilmanifold without significant changes .    instead of focusing on the gowers norms themselves , we study the associated dual norms that fit within this framework and the associated dual functions .",
    "moreover , in the statement of the inverse theorem , and more generally in uses of the gowers norms , one typically assumes that the functions are bounded by @xmath14 .",
    "> from the duality point of view , instead we study functions in the dual space itself , we can consider functions that are within a small @xmath15 error from functions in this space .",
    "this allows us to restrict ourselves to dual functions of functions in a certain @xmath16 class ( theorem  [ th : k ] ) .",
    "moreover , we rephrase the inverse theorem in terms of dual functions ( see section  [ subsec : def_dual_functions ] for precise meanings of the term ) in certain @xmath17 classes , and in this form the gowers norms do not appear explicitly ( section  [ subsec : approx ] ) .",
    "this reformulates the inverse theorem more in a classical analysis context .",
    "the dual functions allow us to introduce algebras of functions on the compact abelian group @xmath18 . for @xmath19",
    ", this corresponds to the classical fourier algebra . finding an interpretation for the higher order uniformity norms is hard and",
    "no analogs of fourier analysis and simple formulas , such as parseval , exist . for @xmath20 , the higher order fourier algebra",
    "are analogs of the classical case of the fourier algebra .",
    "these algebras allow us to further describe the dual functions . starting with a dual function of level @xmath21",
    ", we find that it lies in the fourier algebra of order @xmath21 , giving us information on its dual norm @xmath22 , and by an approximation result , we understand further the original function .",
    "we obtain a result on compactness ( theorem  [ th : main ] ) of dual functions , by applying a variation of the classical szemerdi regularity lemma .",
    "throughout , we assume that @xmath18 is a compact abelian group and let @xmath23 denote haar measure on @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath18 is finite , then @xmath23 is the uniform measure ; the classical case to keep in mind is when @xmath24 and the measure of each element is @xmath25 .",
    "all functions are implicitly assumed to be real valued .",
    "when @xmath18 is infinite , we also implicitly assume that all functions and sets are measurable .",
    "for @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28 norm ; if there is a need to specific the measure , write @xmath29 or @xmath30 when we wish to emphasize the space .",
    "we fix an integer @xmath1 throughout and the dependence on @xmath21 is implicit in all statements .",
    "we have various spaces of various dimensions : @xmath14 , @xmath21 , @xmath31 .",
    "ordinary letters @xmath32 are reserved for spaces of one dimension , vector notation @xmath33 for dimension @xmath21 , and bold face characters @xmath34 for dimension @xmath31 .    if @xmath6 is a function on @xmath18 and @xmath35 , we write @xmath36 for the function on @xmath18 defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath6 is a @xmath23-integrable function on @xmath18 , we write @xmath39 we use similar notation for multiple integrals . if @xmath6 and @xmath40 are functions on @xmath18 , we write @xmath41 assuming that the integral on the right hand side is defined .",
    "if @xmath21 is a positive integer , we set @xmath42 elements of @xmath43 are written as @xmath44 , without commas or parentheses . writing @xmath45 , we set @xmath46    for @xmath47 , we write @xmath48 .    for @xmath49 and @xmath50 we write @xmath51      the _ uniformity norms _ , or _ gowers norms _",
    ", @xmath52 , @xmath53 , of a function @xmath54 are defined inductively by @xmath55 and for @xmath53 , @xmath56 note that @xmath57 is not actually a norm .",
    "( see  @xcite for more on these norms and  @xcite for a related seminorm in ergodic theory . )",
    "if there is ambiguity as to the underlying group @xmath18 , we write @xmath58 .",
    "these norms can also be defined by closed formulas : @xmath59    we can rewrite this formula .",
    "let @xmath60 be the subset of @xmath61 defined by @xmath62 this set can be viewed as the `` set of cubes of dimension @xmath21 '' ( see , for example , @xcite or  @xcite ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath60 is a closed subgroup of @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath63 denote its haar measure .",
    "then @xmath60 is the image of @xmath64 under the map @xmath65 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath63 is the image of @xmath66 ( taken @xmath67 times ) under the same map . if @xmath68 , @xmath49 , are functions in @xmath69 , then @xmath70 in particular , for @xmath54 , @xmath71 associating the coordinates of the set @xmath43 with the coordinates of the euclidean cube , we have that the measure @xmath63 is invariant under permutations that are associated to the isometries of the euclidean cube .",
    "these permutations act transitively on @xmath43 .    for @xmath19 , by parseval",
    "s identity we have that @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the dual group of @xmath18 and @xmath74 is the fourier transform of @xmath6 . for @xmath75 , no analogous simple formula is known and the interpretation of the gowers uniformity norms is more difficult .",
    "a deeper understanding of the higher order norms is , in part , motivation for the current work .",
    "we make use of the `` cauchy - schwarz - gowers inequality '' ( csg ) used in the proof of the subadditivity of gowers norms :    [ prop : csg ] let @xmath68 , @xmath49 , be @xmath76 functions belonging to @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath77    applying the cauchy - schwarz - gowers inequality with half of the functions equal to @xmath6 and the other half equal to the constant @xmath14 , we deduce that @xmath78 for every @xmath79 .    for @xmath54 , define the _ dual function _ @xmath80 on @xmath18 by @xmath81",
    "it follows from the definition that @xmath82    more generally , we define :    if @xmath83 for @xmath84 , we denote @xmath85 we call such a function the _ cubic convolution product of the functions @xmath86_.    there is a formal similarity between the cubic convolution product and the classic convolution product ; for example , @xmath87      for @xmath49 and @xmath88 , we write @xmath89 , maintaining the convention that such elements are written without commas or parentheses .",
    "thus @xmath90    the image of @xmath91 under each of the two natural projections on @xmath61 is @xmath60 , and the image of the measure @xmath92 under these projections is @xmath63 .",
    "[ lem : ddf ] let @xmath68 , @xmath93 , be @xmath94 functions in @xmath69 .",
    "then for all @xmath38 , @xmath95 in particular , for every @xmath54 , @xmath96    without loss , we can assume that all functions are nonnegative .",
    "we proceed by induction on @xmath53 .    for nonnegative @xmath97 and @xmath98 ,",
    "@xmath99 this proves the case @xmath19 .",
    "assume that the result holds for some @xmath53 .",

    "if we have @xmath110 functions in @xmath108 , then inequality   remains valid .",
    "similarly , the definitions and results extend to @xmath111 and to cubic convolution products for functions belonging to @xmath108 .    the bounds given here ( such as  ) can be improved and made sharp .",
    "in particular , one can show that @xmath112 and @xmath113 we omit the proofs , as they are not used in the sequel .",
    "when @xmath18 is infinite , we define the _ uniform space of level @xmath21 _ to be the completion of @xmath69 under the norm @xmath0 . as @xmath21 increases ,",
    "the corresponding uniform spaces shrink .",
    "a difficulty is that the uniform space may contain more than just functions .",
    "for example , if @xmath114 , the uniform space of level @xmath115 consists of the distributions @xmath116 on @xmath117 whose fourier transform @xmath118 satisfies @xmath119 .",

    "more generally , if @xmath68 , @xmath93 are @xmath94 functions belonging to @xmath108 , then the cubic convolution product @xmath128 is a continuous function on @xmath18 .    by density and",

    "consider the space @xmath108 endowed with the norm @xmath0 . by  , the dual of this normed space can be viewed as a subspace of @xmath133 , with the duality given by the pairing @xmath134 .",

    "functions belonging to this space are called _ anti - uniform functions of level @xmath21_. the norm on the anti - uniform space given by duality is called the _ anti - uniform norm of level @xmath21 _ and is denoted by @xmath135 .",
    "obviously , when @xmath18 is finite , then every function on @xmath18 is an anti - uniform function .",
