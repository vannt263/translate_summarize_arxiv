    "a @xmath0 spin liquid is a fascinating three - dimensional state of matter which exhibits long - range entanglement in the ground state and a gapless excitation spectrum which is stable against small perturbations to the hamiltonian , without the need for symmetry protection .",
    "spin liquid is unstable to confinement ( in the absence of massless gauge charges ) and does not represent a stable phase of matter @xcite .",
    "] theoretically , the conventional @xmath0 spin liquid is described by the deconfined phase of a compact @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the system has an emergent gapless gauge mode , with a low - energy effective theory given simply by the maxwell lagrangian of a relativistic photon , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the field strength corresponding to a vector potential @xmath3 , and the effective  speed of light \" is determined by microscopic parameters .",
    "the gaplessness of the photon is protected by gauge invariance , just like in qed . at slightly higher energies",
    ", the spectrum of the theory also contains particles carrying charge under the emergent gauge field .",
    "spin liquid and another phase . ]",
    "this gives rise to an emergent electromagnetism in @xmath0 spin liquids .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of this theory are the components of the spatial vector @xmath4 , with the @xmath5 component simply serving as a lagrange multiplier to enforce the gauge constraint .",
    "the transverse components of @xmath4 represent the polarizations of the emergent photon , and the longitudinal component can be interpreted as particles .",
    "microscopically , such a hilbert space arises by rewriting the fundamental degrees of freedom , such as spins on a lattice , into a language which maps a geometrically frustrating spin interaction ( e.g.  spin ice rules \" ) into a gauge constraint .",
    "the reader is referred to reference @xcite for a more thorough discussion of the @xmath0 spin liquid hilbert space , and to reference @xcite for a review of spin liquids more generally .",
    "while the vector potential theory is most familiar , it has recently been realized that there is a wide class of other spin liquids described by emergent tensor gauge fields . in particular , it has been shown that systems described by symmetric tensor @xmath0 gauge fields exhibit a stable deconfined phase , making these a new class of stable gapless spin liquids @xcite . as in the conventional @xmath0 spin liquid , these systems have robust gaplessness without needing to rely on symmetry protection .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the particles carrying the gauge charge in these theories obey extra conservation laws which restrict their motion to lie on certain lower - dimensional subspaces @xcite .",
    "for example , certain theories have particles carrying a vector charge , which can move only along one - dimensional subspaces , in the direction of their charge vector .",
    "in other models , the fundamental charges can not move at all , without the creation of additional particles .",
    "other types of subdimensional particles are also possible .",
    "this subdimensional behavior makes these theories the natural @xmath0 analogues of the discrete  fracton \" models constructed by vijay , haah , and fu @xcite .",
    "these phases also exhibit an emergent sort of electromagnetism , but of a more exotic form .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are now tensor - valued objects instead of vectors .",
    "we will see that currents of the subdimensional particles are also described by tensor objects .",
    "furthermore , in each distinct higher rank @xmath0 spin liquid phase , there is a different set of generalized maxwell equations .",
    "this gives us many new types of generalized electromagnetism to play with . as discussed in previous work",
    ", there are actually an infinite number of such higher rank @xmath0 theories . for the sake of finiteness",
    ", we shall here work with the rank 2 symmetric tensor theories , of which there are four distinct spin liquid phases .",
    "any other higher rank theory ought to be amenable to the same sort of analysis .",
    "we will focus on generalizing some of the basic concepts of undergraduate electromagnetism to these higher rank @xmath0 theories , such as electrostatic fields , potential formulations , lorentz forces , and biot - savart laws .    before proceeding to the main analysis , we first quickly recap the properties of the four types of rank 2 symmetric tensor @xmath0 spin liquids , developed in @xcite and @xcite . in all cases ,",
    "the degrees of freedom are those of a symmetric rank 2 compact @xmath0 tensor @xmath6 , with a conjugate variable @xmath7 representing a generalized electric field .",
    "the four types of theories are distinguished by the different types of gauss s laws which are imposed upon this electric field tensor .",
    "the different theories are as follows :      in this theory , the gauss s law takes the form @xmath8 , for vector - valued charge @xmath9 .",
    "the charges of this theory ( working on a closed manifold , for simplicity ) obey two constraints : @xmath10 reflecting the conservation of both the charge and its angular moment .",
    "apply to an open manifold as well .",
    "we note that , strictly speaking , @xmath11 should be given a branch cut for the case of the closed manifold .",
    "there is no issue , since such a branch cut can simply be chosen to lie away from the charge distribution . ] in order to obey these conservation laws , the vector charges are forced to become 1-dimensional particles , hopping only along the direction of their charge vector .",
    "the gapless gauge mode for this theory has three independent polarizations .",
    "this theory has a magnetic field tensor @xmath12 which is also symmetric and obeys a corresponding magnetic gauss s law , @xmath13 , for magnetic charge @xmath14 .",
    "the magnetic field tensor has two spatial derivatives , leading to a quadratic dispersion for the gauge mode .",
    "this theory possesses a self - duality between the electric and magnetic tensors .",
    "we shall therefore focus mainly on the case where only electric charges and currents are present in the theory .",
    "results for magnetic charges and currents can be obtained straightforwardly by duality .",
    "we here have the same gauss s law from the previous theory , @xmath8 , but also add in a tracelessness constraint , @xmath15 .",
    "we are free to impose this constraint on the entire hilbert space , since it is a local constraint ( no derivatives ) .",
    "one could also consider allowing the constraint to break by adding trace charges , @xmath16 .",
    "this could be treated by similar methods , but would make the analysis more cumbersome and does not change the results qualitatively , so we focus on the case where the microscopic variables are exactly traceless .",
    "this theory has both of the conservation laws of the previous theory , plus two new conservation laws related to the tracelessness : @xmath17 = 0\\ ] ] these constraints restrict the fundamental charges from moving at all , turning them into fractons ( 0-dimensional particles ) .",
    "the only mobile particles in this theory are bound states , which will be discussed later .",
    "the gapless gauge mode of this theory has two independent polarizations .",
    "the theory has a symmetric traceless magnetic field tensor @xmath12 , now with three spatial derivatives , leading to a cubic dispersion for the gauge mode .",
    "once again , the theory exhibits self - duality , swapping the role of the electric and magnetic field tensors .",
    "we now consider a theory with a two - derivative gauss s law , @xmath18 , for scalar charge @xmath19 .",
    "let s also first suppose the electric field tensor is traceless , @xmath15 , saving the traceful analogue for last .",
    "the theory has three constraints on the charge : @xmath20 reflecting the conservation of charge , dipole moment , and one specific component of the quadrupole moment .",
    "the fundamental charges are fractons , unable to hop in any direction without the creation of additional charges .",
    "the mobile excitations are dipolar bound states , which behave as two - dimensional particles , only able to hop transversely to the dipole moment .",
    "the gapless gauge mode has four independent polarizations .",
    "the magnetic field tensor @xmath12 is a symmetric traceless tensor , just like @xmath7 , leading once again to self - duality .",
    "there is only one spatial derivative in @xmath12 , leading to a linear dispersion for the gauge mode .",
    "lastly , we take the gauss s law to be the same as the previous theory , @xmath18 , but without imposing any tracelessness constraint . in some sense , this is actually the simplest of the theories .",
    "however , a few extra comments are necessary , since this theory does not have the self - duality property of the previous theories .",
    "( thanks are due to sagar vijay , who first noticed the issue with duality in this model , which was missed in all previous work . )",
    "the electric charges of the theory have two constraints : @xmath21 corresponding to the conservation of charge and dipole moment . once again , the fundamental charges are fractons",
    ". the dipolar bound states of this theory are now fully mobile , possessing both longitudinal and transverse motion .",
    "the gapless gauge mode has five independent polarizations .",
    "unlike the previous theories , the appropriate magnetic field tensor for this theory is actually a _ non - symmetric _ ( and traceless ) tensor @xmath12 , with one spatial derivative , leading to linear gauge mode dispersion .",
    "there is a symmetric tensor which one could write down , but this artificially tunes ones of the polarizations of the gauge mode to have a flat dispersion .",
    "it can readily be checked that the non - symmetric traceless tensor @xmath22 represents the stable fixed point of the theory where all five polarizations have the same dispersion .",
    "this non - symmetric tensor obeys a different gauss s law , @xmath13 , with vector magnetic charge .",
    "the magnetic charges obey two constraints : @xmath23 which makes the magnetic vector charges 2-dimensional particles , only hopping transversely to their charge vector .",
    "this theory lacks any sense of self - duality between the electric and magnetic sectors .",
    "nevertheless , it remains stable against confinement due to the lack of instantons .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a duality between a traceful symmetric tensor description ( with one particle and five gauge mode degrees of freedom ) and a traceless non - symmetric tensor description ( with three particle and five gauge mode degrees of freedom )",
    ".    some basic properties of the four phases are summarized in the following table :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one might naively also consider theories with",
    " curl \" constraints , such as @xmath24 . the absence of these theories will be discussed in appendix c.",
    "in this and the following sections , we will go through each of the four theories , one by one .",
    "we shall start with the scalar charge theory , since it turns out to be the simplest to analyze and will lay the groundwork for discussing the other theories .",
    "most of the important concepts will be developed in this section and will be extended in natural fashion in the following sections .",
    "the generalized gauss s law of this theory is given by : @xmath25 for scalar charge @xmath19 .",
    "in the coulomb phase , the particles essentially behave independently .",
    "the fundamental charges in this theory are fractons , unable to hop in any direction without the creation of additional particles .",
    "when such a charge is isolated ( a situation which can be engineered ) , it will provide a delta function source for gauss s law : @xmath26 where charges are quantized as multiples of @xmath27 .",
    "we now wish to know the expectation value of the electric field due to this point source , @xmath28 . to avoid clutter",
    ", we will omit brackets throughout , but the fact that these are expectation values should be borne in mind . since , in the coulomb phase , the particle behaves independently of other particles locations , and since the low - energy effective theory for the gauge field is rotationally invariant , the generalized electric field may only depend on rotationally invariant quantities . furthermore , by dimensional analysis , we know that @xmath29 must scale as @xmath30 .",
    "the only such symmetric rank 2 quantities are as follows : @xmath31 as a first condition , we must satisfy the gauss s law .",
    "we have : @xmath32 so we require @xmath33 to satisfy gauss s law .",
    "the electric field then becomes : @xmath34 note that , unlike the case of conventional electromagnetism , the coulomb field of a static point charge has not been uniquely specified by gauss s law and rotational symmetry . in order to further constrain the electric field ,",
    "we must resort to another of the generalized maxwell equations . for the traceful scalar charge theory ,",
    "the correct magnetic field tensor is the ( non - symmetric ) tensor : @xmath35 ( again , thanks are due to sagar vijay for pointing out the error in the magnetic tensor used in previous work . ) the equation governing the evolution of the magnetic field is then : @xmath36 for a magnetostatic solution , we will then require our coulomb field to satisfy : @xmath37 which means we need @xmath38 . when combined with our earlier condition , @xmath39",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so the final result for the static coulomb field of a point charge ( electric monopole ) of strength @xmath27 is : @xmath42 since the differential equations involved have been linear , we can then find the electric field of a general charge distribution by taking superpositions .",
    "in particular , for a dipole of strength and direction @xmath43 , the appropriate electric field is @xmath44 , which is given by : , we could imagine the charge distribution as a strength @xmath45 charge at location @xmath43 and a strength @xmath46 charge at the origin .",
    "the appropriate electric field is then @xmath47 .",
    "( some care needs to be taken with negative signs here . ) ] @xmath48      there is actually a conceptually cleaner and simpler way to derive these electric field solutions . in the spirit of normal electromagnetism , we will seek a potential formulation , to mitigate the proliferation of indices . from our magnetostatic constraint , @xmath49 , we can immediately conclude that @xmath50 for some vector @xmath51 .",
    "however , by the symmetry of @xmath7 , we must have @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that the curl of @xmath53 vanishes , @xmath54 , so @xmath53 will in turn be a derivative , @xmath55 , for some scalar potential @xmath56 .",
    "we then have : @xmath57 ( note that we have not introduced a negative sign , as one would have done in conventional electromagnetism . the naturalness of this sign convention will be seen later . )",
    "this scalar potential significantly reduces the complexity of the problem . in order to satisfy gauss s law for a point charge",
    ", we must have : @xmath58 by dimensional analysis , @xmath56 must scale as @xmath59 .",
    "the only possibility is @xmath60 for constant @xmath61 ( it can readily be checked that possible logarithmic terms can not solve the gauss s law and can be ruled out ) .",
    "differentiating yields @xmath62 , so we require @xmath63 .",
    "then , taking the appropriate derivatives , we immediately obtain equation [ monopole ] for the coulomb field , as expected . again , due to the linearity of the differential equations , we can then apply the superposition principle to the potential , instead of to the field directly , which is much simpler .",
    "for example , the potential due to a dipole @xmath43 is given by @xmath64 .",
    "the scalar potentials for the electric monopoles and dipoles are : @xmath65 this potential is not simply a convenient mathematical tool . just like in conventional electromagnetism ,",
    "the potential plays a direct physical role .",
    "consider the energy stored in the electric field of a static charge configuration : @xmath66 this equation is exactly the same as is obtained in normal electrostatics .",
    "( note the importance of the sign convention for the potential . )",
    "this tells us that the potential represents the energy associated with a particle at a particular location .",
    "even though fractons possess no sense of forces or equations of motion , we see that fractons nevertheless have a potential energy .",
    "note that the factor of @xmath67 prevents overcounting between charge pairs .",
    "interestingly , @xmath56 for a point charge vanishes at the charge s location , so there is no  self - energy \" contribution to the energy integral .",
    "all energy can be viewed as arising from each particle interacting with the potential of the other particles , but not its own . since @xmath56 for a point charge grows linearly , we see that separating a group of fractons requires an energy linear in the separation , as has been found in previous work .",
    "this large energy cost naively would suggest that the particles are confined .",
    "however , the fractonic nature of these particles , coupled with the fact that the energy density is bounded , stabilizes them against collapsing back into the vacuum , so the fractons are in fact well - defined excitations , albeit very energetically costly .",
    "( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion of the  electrostatic confinement \" issue . )",
    "while the results of the previous sections are good to have in hand , the knowledge of these electric fields and potentials will not mean much unless we know how the charges of the theory will respond to them .",
    "for the fundamental charges of the theory , we already know the answer to this question : they do nt respond at all .",
    "the electric monopoles in this theory are fractons , so they can not hop without a huge input of energy to create extra particles .",
    "they therefore have no equations of motion and do not respond at all to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , the dipolar bound state of a positive and negative charge will be freely propagating in this theory , since a dipole hop will preserve the global dipole moment , as long as the dipole does not change orientation .",
    "a dipole can therefore respond to the electromagnetic fields , but it can not change its orientation , except through interaction with other particles .",
    "we can therefore effectively treat an isolated dipole like a freely hopping point particle .",
    "but what is the effect of the fields on this effective particle ?",
    "we can draw our intuition from the lattice models for the higher rank spin liquids @xcite . in these models",
    ", @xmath6 represents the phase picked up by hopping a @xmath68 oriented dipole in the @xmath69 direction , and also the phase for hopping a @xmath70 oriented dipole in the @xmath71 direction .",
    "effectively , a dipole @xmath72 responds to the magnetic field tensor just like a conventional charged particle would respond to an ordinary electromagnetic field , with an effective vector potential given by @xmath73 and effective magnetic field @xmath74 .",
    "( as a reminder , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 are symmetric tensors , @xmath77 is _ not _ symmetric , so the index of contraction is quite important here . )",
    "the corresponding effective electric field is @xmath78 . the generalized lorentz force on a dipole @xmath43 moving with velocity @xmath79 is then given by :",
    "@xmath80 let us now suppose that a dipole has been placed in an electric field created by some static electric charge distribution , so that @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding electric force is given by : @xmath82 where @xmath56 is the scalar potential .",
    "let us now calculate the work necessary to move the dipole from point 1 to point 2 against the field : @xmath83 we therefore see that the potential energy associated with dipole @xmath43 is given by @xmath84 , which we could have predicted based on our previous discussion of the potential , but it is nice to see this conclusion arise independently .",
    "note that the lorentz force which we have found in this section has a negative sign in front , which looks peculiar at first . as a sanity check ,",
    "let us calculate the electric force between two identical dipoles @xmath43 .",
    "making use of the electric field found in equation [ dipfield ] , we have that the electric force on a dipole at location @xmath85 due to an identical dipole at the origin is given by : @xmath86 the radial component of this force is : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the angle between @xmath43 and @xmath85 .",
    "note that the final quantity in parentheses is always non - negative , indicating a repulsive force between like charges .",
    "flipping the direction of one of the dipoles would result in an overall negative sign , so two oppositely oriented dipoles will attract , a state of affairs which makes intuitive sense , since they can recombine into the vacuum .",
    "interestingly , the lorentz force between two dipoles vanishes when they line up along a line , such that @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum of the potential for like dipoles and a maximum of the potential for opposite dipoles .",
    "therefore , like dipoles energetically prefer to arrange themselves end to end , whereas opposite dipoles prefer to be side by side .",
    "one last comment is in order regarding our lorentz force on dipoles .",
    "the force increases linearly with the dipole moment @xmath43 .",
    "this seems to indicate that there is a much larger force on two unit strength charges separated by some large distance @xmath90 than two unit strength charges right next to each other .",
    "this seems puzzling , since we expect that two well - separated charges should approach the behavior of isolated fractons , which should not move at all .",
    "the resolution comes from the fact that we have identified the force based on the phases associated with hopping matrix elements , but we have not yet accounted for the _ magnitude _ of the hopping elements , which can be conveniently accounted for in terms of the effective mass of the dipoles",
    ". this magnitude will be much smaller ( and the mass much larger ) for dipoles of large separation . whereas hops for the unit strength dipole will appear in the hamiltonian directly , hopping matrix elements for a dipole of separation @xmath90 will only appear at @xmath90-th order perturbation theory , ending up proportional to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the unit strength hopping element and @xmath93 is the mass gap to particle creation .",
    "therefore , the effective mass of a dipole grows exponentially in the particle separation , @xmath94 .",
    "thus , while well - separated dipoles experience a large force , they have an exponentially large effective mass , resulting in exponential suppression of typical velocities . in this manner",
    ", well - separated dipoles will smoothly approach the limit of fractonic behavior .",
    "in addition to static charge distributions , we should also be able to handle steady current flows without too much difficulty .",
    "the fundamental charges are fractons , which can not hop and therefore have no sense of current .",
    "the natural low - energy macroscopic current flows will actually be those of the dipolar bound states . in order to keep track of such dipole motion",
    ", one s first instinct might be to define a ( non - symmetric ) current tensor @xmath95 representing the current of the @xmath71 directed dipoles in the @xmath69 direction .",
    "however , it is important to note that this macroscopic concept only holds in the dilute limit and does not correspond exactly to a microscopic operator .",
    "for example , consider the dense charge configuration in figure [ fig : dipole ] . there is a fundamental ambiguity in defining either the dipole density or @xmath95 in such a case .",
    "microscopically , an operator hopping an @xmath71 dipole in the @xmath69 direction is the same operator hopping a @xmath69 dipole in the @xmath71 direction , so the true microscopic current operator is actually a symmetric tensor @xmath96 , representing the rate at which these hopping processes occur .",
    "this microscopic current tensor will couple to the gauge field as @xmath97 in the hamiltonian .",
    "we shall comment further on the meaning and definition of the microscopic current @xmath96 below .",
    "-oriented dipoles .",
    "but , as seen in the bottom row , the same configuration could be regarded as closely packed @xmath98-oriented dipoles .",
    "this ambiguity is connected with the fact that the current tensor of this theory is symmetric . ]    in terms of the microscopic current , the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath99 noting that @xmath6 is a symmetric tensor , we find the following generalized ampere s equation relating the current to the fields : @xmath100 we note that this generalized ampere s equation can actually be used as the fundamental _ definition _ of the microscopic current @xmath96 .",
    "just as the charge @xmath19 represents the violations of @xmath101 from the  pure \" gauge theory , @xmath96 essentially represents the deviations from the ampere s equation of the pure gauge theory . in order to make connection between this definition and the concept of rates of charge hopping processes",
    ", we can use this equation to derive a continuity equation relating the charge and current . applying @xmath102 to each side of ampere s equation",
    ", we obtain : @xmath103 so we will need @xmath104 for a steady current . assuming this to be the case ,",
    "so that there are steady currents and electric fields , we can drop the @xmath105 term .",
    "we can then rearrange ampere s equation as : @xmath106 we can obtain a general solution for the quantity in parentheses as : @xmath107 for arbitrary tensor @xmath108 . applying @xmath109 to this equation",
    "yields : @xmath110 by its definition , we note that @xmath77 is traceless , @xmath111 , so we are left with : @xmath112 this is the generic solution to our generalized ampere s equation .",
    "however , we must now pick the solution that also obeys the absence of magnetic charges , @xmath113 . by good fortune , we note that the choice @xmath114 is the solution which obeys this property .",
    "the final result for the magnetic field generated by a steady current is : @xmath115 this equation serves as the generalized biot - savart law for this theory . for an arbitrary steady current configuration",
    ", we can use this equation to calculate the resulting magnetic field tensor .",
    "note that the biot - savart law obeys the same scaling as in conventional electromagnetism .",
    "thus , for example , the magnetic field of a current - carrying wire will fall off as @xmath116 with distance @xmath59 away from the wire , just like a conventional current . whereas electric fields of static charges were abnormally energetically costly in this theory , magnetic fields of steady currents are much more in line with standard electromagnetism .",
    "the theory considered in this section , alone of the rank 2 theories , is not self - dual .",
    "the electric particles of this theory are scalars , but the magnetic charges are vectors , @xmath117 , which behave as 2-dimensional particles .",
    "whereas the fields associated with the magnetic particles are easily obtained for self - dual theories , for this theory the magnetic results are not automatic .",
    "the calculation of these fields is similar to other calculations in this paper and would distract from the main line of development , so we relegate the calculations to appendix a. we here simply state the results .",
    "the magnetic field corresponding to a magnetic charge @xmath118 is : @xmath119 the lorentz force on a magnetic particle is : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the projector into the plane transverse to @xmath72 .",
    "the current of magnetic particles takes the form of a traceless non - symmetric tensor @xmath122 , obeying a continuity equation : @xmath123 the generalized faraday s equation is : @xmath124 for a steady magnetic current configuration , the dual biot - savart law is : @xmath125      our task complete , we now take a moment to collect the generalized maxwell equations , from which all of the other results follow . for the scalar charge theory",
    ", these equations take the form : @xmath126 where @xmath19 and @xmath127 are the charge and current of electric particles , and @xmath14 and @xmath128 are the charge and current of magnetic particles .",

    "alternatively , one may consider the limit where trace charges are much more energetically costly than other particles .",
    "either way , we will take the tracelessness condition to hold on all states of interest .",

    "in general , this is not traceless , so we remove the trace and try a potential of the form : @xmath144 if this potential formulation is to work , then by the same rotational symmetry arguments as before , @xmath60 for constant @xmath61 must yield the correct field upon solving gauss s law .",
    "this equation gives @xmath145 , so we require @xmath146 . upon taking the appropriate derivatives , we find that this potential yields the desired electric field . while we have not derived the form of the potential directly from magnetostatics ( as would be most preferable ) , this is actually not necessary to demonstrate its correctness .",
    "this potential formulation ( obtained via educated guess ) works for the point charge .",
    "then , by linearity of all equations involved , we can superpose potentials to get the correct electric field for an arbitrary electrostatic configuration of charges . thus",

    "note that the coefficient of the monopole potential in this case , @xmath149 , is larger than that in the previous traceful case , @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the traceless theory has even stronger interactions between particles .      as in the traceful theory ,",
    "the fundamental particles are fractons and can not respond to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , we still have mobile dipolar bound states , which in this theory are 2-dimensional particles , hopping only in the transverse direction .",
    "the phases picked up upon hopping will still be of the form @xmath151 , but the longitudinal component will not be felt , so we should project into the transverse plane , obtaining the effective vector potential as : @xmath152 where we have defined the projection operator @xmath153 , which projects onto the transverse plane .",
    "the effective magnetic field is then the out - of - plane component of the curl of this vector potential : @xmath154 the corresponding effective electric field is @xmath155 , which lies in the plane , as appropriate .",
    "the generalized lorentz force on a dipole @xmath90 in this theory is then : @xmath156 note that , since the velocity and the effective @xmath76 lie in the plane , and the effective @xmath77 is perpendicular to the plane , the lorentz force always lies in the plane , consistent with the 2-dimensional nature of the dipoles .",
    "let us now take the electromagnetic fields to be generated by some electrostatic configuration of charges , so that @xmath77 vanishes and we may use our earlier potential formulation .",
    "the force law then simplifies to : @xmath157 the work done to move a dipole against the field from point 1 to point 2 in the plane of its motion is then the line integral of the force against the field .",
    "since the path lies in the plane , we may drop the projection operator in the above equation , since the transverse component will be picked out anyway : @xmath158 the second term will not contribute , since @xmath159 for motion in the plane , leaving us with : @xmath160 we see that , once again , the potential energy of a dipole @xmath90 is given by @xmath161 , as it should be , based on the earlier discussion of the potential .    in order to get a fully mobile charge in this theory",
    ", one must consider a bound state which is not only neutral , but also has no net dipole .",
    "such quadrupolar bound states would couple only weakly to the gauge field , hopping via derivatives of @xmath75 instead of @xmath75 itself .",
    "furthermore , not all such quadrupolar bound states are stable .",
    "certain quadrupoles can be created directly from the vacuum , and conversely these bound states can decay back to the vacuum , releasing their energy into the gapless gauge mode .",
    "the only stable quadrupoles are those with a nonzero value of @xmath162 , which prevents decay to the vacuum by the quadrupolar conservation law .",
    "we shall not further investigate the properties of such quadrupolar bound states .",
    "we also wish to characterize steady current distributions in this theory . as in the traceful theory ,",
    "the fundamental microscopic current tensor is a symmetric tensor @xmath96 .",
    "however , in this case @xmath96 must be a traceless tensor , @xmath163 , since the trace component represents the rate of processes which violate the trace constraint on the electric field . in terms of this current",
    ", the hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath164 the corresponding ampere s equation for the time evolution of @xmath7 is : @xmath165 once again , this current tensor will obey a continuity equation : @xmath103 so a steady current requires @xmath104 .",
    "for steady currents , we drop the electric field term in the ampere s equation .",
    "ampere s equation is actually formally the same as that obtained in the traceful theory , so we expect the biot - savart laws to be almost identical .",
    "the only differences are that @xmath12 is now constrained to be symmetric , and the condition for the absence of magnetic charge is different ( @xmath166 in the present case , versus @xmath167 in the previous case ) .",
    "nevertheless , the generic form of equation [ general ] , in terms of arbitrary tensor @xmath108 , is still valid . noting that the final result must be symmetric",
    ", we try the form : @xmath168 this is automatically a solution of the generalized ampere s equation .",
    "the resulting magnetic field tensor is : @xmath169 which is manifestly symmetric .",
    "it also satisfies the equation @xmath166 .",
    "this is therefore the correct generalized biot - savart law for this theory . from this equation",
    ", we can construct the magnetic field tensor for an arbitrary steady current configuration .",
    "the generalized maxwell equations for the traceless scalar charge theory take the form : @xmath170 we have included the tracelessness constraint alongside the other maxwell equations .",
    "but note that the time evolution equation for @xmath76 ensures that , as long as the initial condition for @xmath76 is traceless , it will automatically remain traceless under time evolution .",
    "we have also written out the tracelessness of @xmath77 for symmetry purposes .",
    "note that , unlike the previous theory , the maxwell equations here have a nice symmetry between electric and magnetic quantities , reflecting the self - duality of the theory .",
    "we will now switch gears and move to a theory with a different gauss s law altogether .",
    "our degrees of freedom will still be that of a rank 2 symmetric compact @xmath0 tensor @xmath6 , but we will now take our gauss s law to be @xmath171 , for vector charge @xmath9 .",
    "an isolated charge will provide a delta function source for this gauss s law : @xmath172 for some charge vector @xmath72 .",
    "depends on the lattice .",
    "for example , on the cubic lattice , @xmath72 is quantized as @xmath173 for integers @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , leading to three types of energetically cheapest charges . on other lattices , the quantization rules and",
    "the number of cheapest charges may be different . ] the solution to this equation must be a symmetric rank 2 tensor , must depend only on @xmath177 and @xmath72 , must be linear in @xmath72 , and by dimensional analysis must scale as @xmath178 .",
    "the possible terms are then : @xmath179 we can then take a derivative , being careful about delta functions at the origin ( making use of some useful formulas from appendix b ) .",
    "the result is : @xmath180 in order to solve gauss s law , we therefore need @xmath38 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "this takes us from four unknown coefficients down to one , @xmath133 .",
    "we must then resort to the magnetostatic condition .",
    "for this theory , the magnetic field tensor is given by @xmath183 .",
    "the magnetostatic condition on the electric field is then @xmath184 . to start ,",
    "let us simply look at the trace component of this constraint : @xmath185 where we have made use of the gauss s law .",
    "taking the trace of our general formula , equation [ 1dgeneral ] , yields @xmath186 , which up to a constant is the form of the potential energy for an ordinary electromagnetic dipole .",
    "we can then take @xmath187 of this by appealing to the charge distribution of an ordinary dipole .",
    "( directly differentiating this potential is actually quite subtle , for distributional reasons , but a direct calculation yields the same results @xcite . )",
    "the result is : @xmath188 in order to satisfy equation [ trace ] , we must therefore have @xmath189 . when combined with our earlier results , @xmath38 and @xmath182",
    ", we obtain @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 .",
    "we have only checked so far that this form satisfies the trace magnetostatic condition , but it can be checked that the full magnetostatic condition is also satisfied .",
    "the electrostatic field for a point charge @xmath72 then takes the final form : @xmath193      once again , it will be advantageous to seek a potential formulation for the theory .",
    "from our magnetostatic condition , @xmath194 , we can see that either the first or second index of @xmath29 should have a derivative in it , so @xmath29 should have the form @xmath195 for vectors @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in order to satisfy index symmetry , we set these vectors to be equal .",
    "we also add in a factor of @xmath198 for later convenience , writing the electric field as : @xmath199 the most general form for @xmath200 is : @xmath201 taking derivatives yields : @xmath202 the magnetostatic condition is automatic , but we must check the gauss s law . following the logic of equation [ div ] , we obtain that @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , which correctly reproduces the desired electric field for a point charge . the final result for the potential of a point charge is : @xmath206 note that , unlike the previous two cases , there is no scalar potential formulation , but rather a vector potential .",
    "( it can be explicitly checked that no derivatives of any scalar potential can solve the gauss s law . )",
    "this makes some intuitive sense , since now the gauss s law is a three - component equation , corresponding to three particle degrees of freedom .",
    "any potential formulation must at least capture these three degrees of freedom , so a vector potential is the best we can do .",
    "but this is still a significant simplification over the original tensor formulation , and the potential of an arbitrary charge distribution can be built up by superposing the point charge potential given above .    in order to give a physical interpretation to the potential ,",
    "let us look at the energy stored in the electric field of a static charge configuration : @xmath207 which is very similar in fashion to the previous sections .",
    "the potential @xmath208 in fact represents the potential energy of charge species @xmath72 .",
    "one key difference from the previous theories is that the potential @xmath208 of a point charge blows up at the charge s location , like in conventional electromagnetism , so there are  self - energy \" contributions to the integral which should be handled with care .",
    "a vector point charge @xmath72 can only hop along the @xmath209 direction .",
    "the phases picked up upon completing such hops are @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , these 1-dimensional particles only feel a one - dimensional effective electric field , given by @xmath211 .",
    "these particles do not feel any effects from the magnetic field .",
    "the lorentz force law takes the particularly simple form : @xmath212 for an electrostatic configuration , @xmath213 , we have @xmath214 . the effective force is just the projection of @xmath215 along the @xmath216 direction .",
    "we now wish to calculate the work done in moving a particle along the line of its motion against the force of a field . for this purpose , we are free to use the unprojected force , since the other components will not contribute anyway : @xmath217 we therefore have that the potential energy for charge @xmath218 is given by @xmath219 , as we already found .",
    "in addition to the 1-dimensional particles , one can construct a fully mobile , yet still topologically nontrivial excitation by looking at a bound state with zero net charge @xmath72 but a nonzero charge angular moment , such as seen in figure [ fig : vorton ] .",
    "this bound state is fully mobile , yet can not be created locally ( due to its charge angular moment ) and is therefore stable against decay into the vacuum .",
    "we refer to such a nontrivial excitation , carrying zero charge but nonzero charge angular moment , as a  chiron , \" because all the good names were taken . in the lattice models",
    "@xcite , one can verify that the phase picked up by a chiron carrying angular moment @xmath220 hopping in the @xmath71 direction is @xmath221 , which seems aesthetically pleasing enough to be a universal feature .",
    "this quantity then serves as the effective chiron vector potential , @xmath222 .",
    "the effective chiron magnetic field is @xmath223 .",
    "the lorentz force on a chiron is therefore : @xmath224 note that the chirons will respond to a uniform magnetic field , but only to derivatives of the electric field . in a sense ,",
    "the 1-dimensional particles represent the fundamental unit of response to a uniform electric field , while the chirons represent the fundamental unit of response to a uniform magnetic field .          as in the previous theories ,",
    "the microscopic current operator in this theory will be a symmetric tensor @xmath96 representing the rate of hopping processes .",
    "the current essentially represents the rate of hopping of different types of 1-dimensional particles . in terms of the current operator ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the theory is given by : @xmath225 the time evolution equation for the electric field is then : @xmath226 taking a derivative , we find that the charge and current are related by the continuity equation : @xmath227 so a steady current configuration requires @xmath228 .",
    "taking such a steady current configuration , we can rewrite our ampere s equation as : @xmath229 from our earlier work on the electric field corresponding to @xmath230 , we can write a solution as : @xmath231 subject to the constraint @xmath232 .",
    "( we could also have added in a solution to the homogeneous equation , but it will turn out that we do not need it in this case . ) applying @xmath233 to both sides of the equation above and relabeling some indices yields : @xmath234 we also need the constraint that @xmath113 ( and equivalently , @xmath235 ) .",
    "this can be easily taken care of if the quantity in parentheses has the form @xmath236 for some scalar @xmath56 .",
    "this means that the appropriate choice of @xmath133 and @xmath134 are exactly those appropriate to the electric field of a point charge in the traceful scalar charge theory .",
    "the resulting magnetic field tensor is : @xmath237 the above equation serves as the generalized biot - savart law for this theory and allows us to construct the magnetic field for an arbitrary steady current distribution .",
    "note that this biot - savart law is stronger by one power than the conventional electromagnetic one .",
    "the integrand falls off as @xmath116 instead of @xmath178 .",
    "this will cause currents in this theory to be extremely energetically costly .",
    "for example , whereas the field of a current - carrying wire falls off as @xmath116 in normal electromagnetism , here we expect the field of such a wire to asymptote to a constant ( or perhaps grow logarithmically ) .",
    "thus , even though the particles in this theory are free to move along their appropriate one - dimensional subspace , it will be much harder to set these particles into motion than conventional charges , leading to large inductance associated with currents .",
    "the generalized maxwell equations for the vector charge theory take the form : @xmath238 once again , note the nice symmetry between electric and magnetic quantities , reflecting the self - duality of the theory .",
    "let us now move to the last of the rank 2 theories , which has the same gauss s law as the previous case , @xmath171 , but now with an extra trace condition , @xmath15 .",
    "we start with a point source , @xmath239 .",
    "the corresponding electric field must once again take the form of equation [ 1dgeneral ] .",
    "the gauss s law will lead to the same constraints as before , simplifying our electric field down to : @xmath240 we must also impose the tracelessness condition , @xmath241 , which tells us that @xmath242 , so the electric field of a point charge has the form : @xmath243 even before proceeding to the magnetostatic constraint , the electrostatic field of a point charge is already uniquely constrained in this theory ( though one can check that the magnetostatic constraint is obeyed as well ) .      as always , we now seek some potential formulation for our electrostatic field . just as in the scalar charge traceless case , we shall not derive the potential directly from the magnetostatic condition , but rather will make an ansatz for the potential and then verify that it is the correct one .",
    "we start with the potential formulation for the previous case , @xmath244 and add in an appropriate term to make the electric field traceless : @xmath245 assuming the same general form for the potential as in equation [ vecpot ] , we find that gauss s law is only satisfied if @xmath203 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 , giving a potential : @xmath248 the resulting electric field exactly matches what we found in equation [ tracvecfield ] . since the potential formulation works for the point charge , by linearity it will work for an arbitrary charge distribution .",
    "thus , this is the correct potential formulation , even though it has not been derived directly from the magnetostatic constraint ( which it probably can be ) .",
    "the energy stored in the electric field of a static charge configuration is given by : @xmath249 where we have integrated by parts and made use of gauss s law and tracelessness .",
    "just as in the traceful theory , we find that @xmath250 can quite legitimately be regarded as the potential energy for charges @xmath9 .",
    "the fundamental vector charges in this theory are all fractonic and will have no sense of lorentz forces . like the traceful vector charge theory , this theory will also have chiron bound states , carrying zero charge but nonzero charge angular moment @xmath220 . however , whereas the chirons in the traceful theory were fully mobile , in the present case the extra conservation laws restrict the chirons to be 1-dimensional particles , constrained to move only along the direction of their charge angular moment vector . projecting from the previous theory onto the appropriate one - dimensional subspace ,",
    "the lorentz force on a chiron becomes : @xmath251      as in the traceless scalar charge theory , the microscopic current operator will take the form of a traceless symmetric tensor @xmath96 , representing the rate of hopping processes . for this theory , the magnetic field tensor takes the following form : @xmath252 where @xmath253 is the magnetic tensor from the traceful theory .",
    "it is readily verified that this magnetic tensor is traceless , @xmath111 .",
    "also , this tensor does not look symmetric at first glance .",
    "nevertheless , we find : @xmath254 where we have made use of @xmath255 .",
    "this tells us that the antisymmetric component of @xmath12 actually vanishes , so it is a symmetric traceless tensor , thereby allowing this theory to have a self - duality .",
    "we can then write the magnetic tensor in manifestly symmetric form as : @xmath256 in terms of the microscopic variable @xmath6 , we have the following unspeakable horror : @xmath257 the hamiltonian has the standard form : @xmath258 plugging in the form for @xmath77 and making use of index symmetry , we obtain : @xmath259 noting that @xmath6 is symmetric , the time evolution equation for @xmath76 is given by : @xmath260 this ampere s equation has an unusual feature , in that some of the terms on the left contain direct contractions between derivatives and the magnetic tensor , which can then be written in terms of the magnetic charge , @xmath117 , as follows : @xmath261 it seems rather unusual at first to have magnetic charge appear in ampere s equation , but there is nothing logically inconsistent about it . in particular , after taking a derivative , we still obtain the expected continuity equation for the electric charges : @xmath262 in the absence of magnetic charge , and assuming a steady current configuration , we can drop some terms from ampere s equation , which then simplifies to : @xmath263 we can write a solution as : @xmath264 inverting for @xmath265 gives : @xmath266 the first term by itself is not symmetric . however , we can choose : @xmath267 the resulting magnetic field tensor is : @xmath268 this equation is manifestly traceless and symmetric .",
    "it also satisfies @xmath113 ( making use of @xmath228 for a steady current ) , which indicates the absence of magnetic charge .",
    "we have therefore found the correct biot - savart law for this theory , which can then be used to obtain the magnetic field tensor for an arbitrary steady current configuration .",
    "note that , like in the previous theory , the biot - savart law falls off very slowly , leading to large inductances in this theory .",
    "the generalized maxwell equations for the traceless vector charge theory take the following mildly nauseating form : @xmath269 once again , the equations have a nice electric - magnetic symmetry , reflecting the self - duality of the theory .",
    "in this work , we have generalized some of the basic notions of electromagnetism to systems with tensor @xmath0 gauge fields , instead of the conventional @xmath0 vector gauge theory .",
    "the topics treated here have included electrostatic fields , potential formulations , maxwell equations , lorentz forces , and biot - savart laws .",
    "there is much that carries over quite naturally , while some concepts have interesting modifications , such as needing two derivatives to get from potential to electric field in some theories . while we have laid the groundwork here , there is much more that could be done . obviously one could work out the electromagnetic properties of rank 3 and higher theories .",
    "but also , electromagnetism is a much broader subject than just the topics treated here . in principle , one could pull out their favorite electromagnetism textbook and generalize everything chapter by chapter to the higher rank analogue .",
    "one could work out the theory of higher rank radiation , higher rank circuits , higher rank waveguides , etc .",
    "it s a brand new playground .",
    "i would like to particularly thank sagar vijay , for numerous helpful discussions and for pointing out an error regarding one of the magnetic tensors used in previous work .",
    "i would also like to thank senthil todadri , liujun zou , yahui zhang , and inti sodemann for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by nsf dmr-1305741 .",
    "as mentioned in the text , the scalar charge theory ( without trace condition ) is not self - dual .",
    "therefore , we can not simply read off the fields for magnetic particles from the corresponding electric ones , and they must be calculated separately . while the electric charges of this theory were scalars , the magnetic charges are vectors , @xmath270 . for an electrostatic configuration , in the absence of electric currents , we must also have : @xmath271 recall that @xmath265 in this theory is traceless , but not symmetric .",
    "for brevity , we will go right for the throat and take a potential formulation : @xmath272 which can be verified to solve the electrostatic constraint .",
    "we now wish this magnetic field to satisfy the magnetic gauss s law for a point source : @xmath273 as an educated guess , we will take an ansatz of the form : @xmath274 we have : @xmath275 @xmath276 @xmath277 to solve the magnetic gauss s law , we need @xmath278 and @xmath279 , which has the solution @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "our potential then has the form : @xmath282 and the magnetic field takes the form : @xmath119 we can also consider a traceless ( non - symmetric ) tensor current @xmath128 for the magnetic particles . in the presence of this magnetic current , the time evolution equation for @xmath12",

    "we have therefore found the correct dual biot - savart law for this theory . from this formula",
    ", we can construct the electric field tensor corresponding to an arbitrary steady current of magnetic particles .    in order to derive the lorentz force for the magnetic particles ,",

    "we note that this force always lies in the transverse plane , consistent with the 2-dimensional nature of the particles .",
    "as we all learned in our undergraduate days , the divergence of the electric field of a point charge is given by : @xmath293 this can be derived by performing an integral over a ball @xmath294 of radius @xmath295 centered at the origin : @xmath296 since this must be true for arbitrary @xmath295 , we can conclude that there must be a delta function contribution at the origin .",
    "we will list below some further useful formulas , derived via the same technique , which are useful for the manipulations performed in the main text .",

    "in the text , we have considered different forms of gauss s laws . these were all either generalized divergences or trace conditions .",
    "but what about generalized curl constraints , such as @xmath24 ? to see why we are not considering this type of theory ,",
    "we first must ask why we usually do nt look at the rank 1 analogue , @xmath303 .",
    "the answer is quite simple .",
    "whereas the divergence constraint gave rise to point particles , such a curl constraint naturally gives rise to string - like excitations .",
    "this is due to the fact that : @xmath304 so the vector charges are automatically forced to form closed loops , a constraint which can not be broken within the hilbert space . actually , we can rewrite the gauge constraint as : @xmath305 where we have defined the antisymmetric tensor @xmath306 , which captures all the information of the original vector .",
