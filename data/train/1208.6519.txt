    "microscopic capacitively coupled plasmas operated at atmospheric pressure and at a radio frequency of typically 13.56 mhz , e.g. microscopic atmospheric pressure plasma jets ( @xmath2-appj ) , are frequently used for surface processing and medical applications @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal glow discharge plasma in these sources consists of hot electrons and cold heavy particles ( ions , neutrals ) close to room temperature @xcite .",
    "such discharges can be used for sensitive surface treatments including human tissue .",
    "atmospheric pressure plasmas avoid the necessity of expensive vacuum systems required for processing applications in low pressure discharges , while providing a high degree of dissociation and an effective generation of reactive species useful for surface treatment @xcite .",
    "there are different types of appjs such as coaxial and plane parallel configurations @xcite .",
    "the latter design concept is based on the plasma jet introduced by selwyn et al . in 1998",
    "@xcite and modified by schulz - von der gathen et al .",
    "@xcite : the feed gas flows between two electrodes separated by a gap of about 1 - 2 mm and driven at 13.56 mhz . in the experiment the electrodes are typically made of stainless steel and are enclosed by quartz windows including the plasma volume and the effluent . in this way direct optical access to the plasma and the effluent is provided .",
    "usually the discharge is operated in helium with some optional admixture of oxygen and/or nitrogen with typical gas velocities around 100 m / s @xcite .",
    "the generation of reactive species , that determine surface processes in the effluent , is caused by electron impact excitation , ionization , and dissociation in the plasma volume between the electrodes .",
    "thus , a detailed understanding of the dynamics of highly energetic electrons in the plasma is essential and provides the basis for any optimization of surface processing applications .",
    "the electron dynamics in ( microscopic ) appjs has been investigated experimentally by , e.g. schulz - von der gathen et al .",
    "@xcite , benedikt et al .",
    "@xcite , and kong et al .",
    "@xcite by phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy @xcite as well as numerically by waskoenig et al . @xcite and kong et al . @xcite . within the rf period several maxima of the emission at distinct positions and times",
    "have been observed : ( i ) during sheath expansion electrons are accelerated towards the opposing electrode and cause excitation / ionization adjacent to the expanding sheath edge @xcite .",
    "( ii ) at the time of maximum sheath voltage excitation and ionization by secondary electrons is observed at both sheaths @xcite .",
    "( iii ) during sheath collapse another excitation maximum is observed in microscopic appjs at each electrode @xcite .",
    "this maximum is assumed to be caused by an electric field reversal localized at the sheath edge and caused by electron - neutral collisions @xcite .",
    "( iv ) significant excitation and ionization inside the bulk at the times of fastest sheath expansion are observed @xcite .",
    "these maxima have been correlated with high bulk electric fields , but their exact physical origin is not completely understood . at low driving voltage or power ,",
    "the excitation during sheath expansion is typically stronger than the excitation by secondary electrons @xcite .",
    "such mode transitions induced by changing the rf voltage amplitude are similar to the mode transitions discussed by belenguer and boeuf at low pressures @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the electron heating and ionization dynamics in an atmospheric pressure microplasma with plane parallel electrodes driven at 13.56 mhz , as a function of the rf voltage amplitude , by particle in cell ( pic ) simulations and semi - analytical modeling .",
    "the discharge is operated in helium .",
    "we reveal the origin of the ionization in the bulk and show that the ionization maxima adjacent to the collapsing sheaths are not caused by a classical localized field reversal under the conditions investigated . based on the analytical model , we demonstrate that the strong ionization in the bulk and at the sheath edges is caused by a high electric field inside the bulk at the time of maximum current .",
    "this high field originates from a low dc conductivity due to a high electron - neutral collision frequency at atmospheric pressure in the bulk .",
    "the phase shift between current and voltage is found to be affected by the driving voltage amplitude .",
    "thus , maximum electron heating and ionization occur at different times within the rf period depending on the voltage amplitude , that also affects the spatial profile of the electron heating and ionization rates .",
    "we compare our results to low pressure macroscopic electronegative capacitive discharges operated in cf@xmath3 , where similar effects are caused by the high electronegativity instead of a high collision frequency @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that a novel mode of discharge operation , the @xmath0-mode , is present in atmospheric pressure microplasmas , where ionization is dominated by ohmic heating in the bulk .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  2 , the pic simulation and the semi - analytical model to describe the electric field in the bulk are introduced . in the third section ,",
    "the results are presented and discussed .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section  4 .",
    "we use a 1d3v ( one spatial dimension and three dimensions in velocity space ) explicit kinetic code based on the particle - in - cell algorithm to study the heating and ionization dynamics in capacitive atmospheric pressure microplasmas with plane parallel electrodes of identical surface areas separated by a gap of 2 mm .",
    "collisions are treated by the monte - carlo method .",
    "the code works in the electrostatic approximation , i.e. @xmath4 . the driving voltage waveform is @xmath5 with f = 13.56 mhz and @xmath6 = 500 v , 330 v. to overcome the limitation of a very small time step  the electron elastic collision frequency has to be resolved ",
    "the simulations are accelerated : we use a coarse - sorting algorithm for massive parallelization of the code on graphics processing units ( gpu ) @xcite .",
    "we consider electrons and he@xmath7 ions taking cross sections from @xcite and use an ion - induced secondary electron emission coefficient of @xmath8 as well as an electron sticking coefficient at the electrodes of 0.5 .",
    "the gas temperature is set to 350  k.    in order to compare the results obtained for atmospheric pressure microplasmas operated in helium to low pressure macroscopic electropositive and electronegative discharges we also perform pic simulations of ar and cf@xmath3 discharges with an electrode gap of 1.5 cm operated at 80 pa .",
    "the cross sections for ar are taken from @xcite . in case of cf@xmath3",
    ", we consider electrons and the ions cf@xmath9 , cf@xmath10 , f@xmath11 using cross sections and rate coefficients from @xcite . a rate constant of 5.5@xmath12 is used for the ion - ion recombination ( cf@xmath13 + cf@xmath10 , cf@xmath13 + f@xmath11 ) . the coefficient for secondary electron emission at the electrodes due to ion bombardment",
    "is varied in the electropositive case and is set to @xmath8 in electronegative cf@xmath3 .",
    "the probability of sticking of electrons at the electrodes is assumed to be @xmath14 in these simulations . in both the electropositive and the electronegative cases at low pressure",
    "the gas temperature is kept constant at 350  k @xcite .      in order to understand the physical origin of the bulk electric field obtained from the pic simulations , an analytical expression for the electric field",
    "is deduced , following @xcite .",
    "the model is based on a combination of the electron continuity and momentum balance equations , i.e. : @xmath15    @xmath16    here , @xmath17 is the electron partial pressure , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the electron density , @xmath20 is the electron temperature , @xmath21 is the electric field , @xmath22 is the electron flux , @xmath23 is the electron mass , @xmath24 is the ionization source , and @xmath25 is the frequency of elastic electron - neutral collisions . combining ( [ eq : e_continuity ] ) and ( [ eq : e_momentum ] ) and assuming quasineutrality in the bulk as well as a spatially homogeneous electron temperature yields :    @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is the electron conduction current density and @xmath28 .",
    "the first and third term of equation [ eqefield ] correspond to electric fields caused by inertia effects , while the second term is a drift field , the fourth term is the ambipolar field , and the fifth term corresponds to an electric field caused by an ionization source .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     decreasing the driving voltage amplitude from 500 v to 330 v in case of atmospheric pressure microdischarges operated in helium under otherwise identical discharge conditions as shown in figure [ plots500v ] significantly affects the electron heating and ionization dynamics , as shown in figure [ plots330v ] .",
    "the electron density is approximately one order of magnitude lower ( a ) and the electric field ( c ) , the electron conduction current density ( d ) , the electron heating rate ( e ) , and the ionization rate ( f ) are maximum in the bulk at a later phase within the rf period .",
    "this is caused by a higher bulk resistance due to the lower plasma density , which now dominates compared to the sheath impedance and reduces the phase shift between current and voltage to @xmath29 , i.e. the discharge becomes more resistive @xcite . since current and voltage are almost in phase , maximum bulk electric field , the current , the heating , and the ionization are observed at a later phase within the rf period .",
    "the electron heating is again dominated by ohmic bulk heating .",
    "the heating and ionization rates peak in the discharge center and no longer at the sheath edges , since the conduction current is only high in the centre .",
    "the high electric field in the center is still predominantly caused by a low dc conductivity due to the high collision frequency , i.e. the second term of equation ( [ eqefield ] ) .",
    "however , under these conditions there is a significant violation of quasineutrality , which increases towards the electrodes . as the applicability of the model",
    "is reduced in such regions , deviations between the modelled field and the electric field obtained from the simulation are found outside the center .",
    "figure [ phaseshift ] shows the phase shift between the applied voltage and the conduction current density in the discharge center , @xmath30 , as a function of the voltage amplitude between 330 v and 530 v. the phase shift is found to increase monotonically due to the increasing plasma density and decreasing resistivity . at voltages above 530 v the pic simulation diverges .",
    "this might correspond to arcing in the experiment .",
    "electron heating and ionization dynamics in capacitively coupled atmospheric pressure microplasmas operated in helium at 13.56 mhz and different voltage amplitudes were investigated by pic simulations and semi - analytical modeling .",
    "the results were compared to electropositive argon and electronegative cf@xmath3 macroscopic low pressure capacitive rf discharges .",
    "the electron heating dynamics in atmospheric pressure microplasmas is found to be dominated by the ohmic bulk heating of electrons due to high electric fields in the discharge center at the phases of maximum current in the rf period .",
    "the model reveals the physical origin of this @xmath0-mode by identifying the high electric fields in the discharge center to be predominantly drift fields caused by a low conductivity due to the high electron - neutral collision frequency at atmospheric pressure .",
    "this heating mode is similar to the drift - ambipolar heating of electrons in low pressure electronegative macroscopic capacitive discharges operated in cf@xmath3 , where a high bulk electric field is caused by a low conductivity due to a low electron density caused by the high electronegativity .    in atmospheric pressure microplasmas",
    "the heating and ionization dynamics are found to be affected by the amplitude of the driving voltage waveform . at high amplitudes ,",
    "the plasma density is high and the bulk resistance is comparable to the sheath impedance , so that current and voltage are approximately 45@xmath1 out of phase .",
    "maximum ionization is observed adjacent to the sheath edges due to local maxima of the drift field caused by the ion density profile , that decreases towards the electrodes .",
    "these maxima of the ionization are not caused by direct interaction of electrons with the oscillating sheath electric fields such as observed in low pressure macroscopic electropositive discharges .",
    "there is no cooling of electrons during sheath collapse . at lower",
    "driving voltage amplitudes , the plasma density decreases , so that the bulk resistance increases and the discharge becomes more resistive .",
    "consequently , the phase shift between voltage and current decreases and maximum ionization is observed in the discharge center at a later phase within the rf period .",
    "these results might improve the understanding of the spatio - temporal emission in microscopic appjs @xcite measured by phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy @xcite and serve as a basis for a better understanding of chemical processes in such plasmas .",
    "future investigations of the @xmath0-mode in electronegative atmospheric pressure microplasmas as well as experimental verifications of the observed dependence of the phase shift between current and voltage on the driving voltage amplitude are clearly required .    this project is funded by the dfg ( german research foundation ) within the framework of the research unit for 1123 , sfb tr 87 , sfb tr 24 , project b5 , and the hungarian fund for scientific research ( otka k77653 and k105476 ) ."
