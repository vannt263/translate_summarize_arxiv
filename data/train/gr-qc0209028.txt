    "in 1911 , five years before general relativity was formulated , einstein used the equivalence principle to calculate the bending of a light ray in a weak gravitational field @xcite . by considering the doppler shift suffered by a light ray in a reference system that moves with acceleration @xmath0 in the absence of a gravitational field",
    ", einstein deduced that the frequency of light must experience a shift @xmath1 when the light moves a height @xmath2 in a weak static gravitational field @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "because einstein did not yet possess a metric theory of gravity , he reasoned that the gravitational redshift compels us to use `` clocks of unlike constitution for measuring time at places with differing gravitational potential '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , because the number of wave maxima per unit of time should not vary at different heights in a static gravitational field , a clock must go @xmath5 times more slowly at @xmath6 than at @xmath7 .",
    "einstein concluded that the velocity of light is @xmath8 when it is measured with clocks of equal constitution ; instead , the use of clocks of unequal constitution implies that the velocity of propagation should increase at the same rate as the clocks go slower : @xmath9 .",
    "( `` the principle of constancy of the velocity of light holds good according to this theory in a different form from that which usually underlies the ordinary theory of relativity '' @xcite ) .",
    "thus a plane wave traveling transversely to a gravitational field changes its direction of propagation -literally , it falls- because the secondary fronts of the huygens construction advance faster where the gravitational potential is higher .",
    "in fact , the deflection @xmath10 in fig .  1 is @xmath11 \\delta t}{h}}\\simeq { \\frac{gh / c^{2}}{h } c } \\delta",
    "t\\simeq gc^{-2}\\delta x\\ , . \\label{onda}\\ ] ]    remarkably , the result in eq .",
    "( [ onda ] ) can also be obtained by a direct application of the equivalence principle to the trajectory of a particle traveling at the speed of light . in the accelerated system ( @xmath12 )",
    "such a particle follows the equations of motion @xmath13 and @xmath14 . therefore , its trajectory is @xmath15 , so its slope after a displacement @xmath16 is @xmath17 in agreement with eq .",
    "( [ onda ] ) .",
    "it is frequently emphasized that eq .",
    "( [ onda ] ) does not agree with the experimentally tested bending of light predicted by general relativity @xcite , but only equals half this value ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this issue has deserved much attention , and it is usually said that the equivalence principle contributes one half to the deflection while the other half comes from the spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "in fact , the equivalence principle only prescribes the form @xmath18 for the temporal part of the metric associated with a weak gravitational potential @xmath19 , but says nothing about the spatial geometry , which certainly influences a light ray .",
    "however , this way of relating the equivalence principle to the relativistic bending of light diminishes the value of the equivalence principle by suggesting that the equivalence principle is unable to predict a quantitative physical result .    to reinstate the equivalence principle as a full statement about the local behavior of matter and radiation in a gravitational field so that it can yield results in quantitative agreement with those from a metric theory of gravity",
    ", we should first establish the kind of deflection that is referred to by the equivalence principle in the context of a metric theory of gravity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an approach of this type ) . in general , the notion of deflection of a trajectory relative to a _ fixed _ direction entails the parallel transport of that direction along the trajectory . as it is well known , the angle between a trajectory and a parallel transported direction does not change when the trajectory is a geodesic . instead ,",
    "if the trajectory is not a geodesic , then the angle will change ( the trajectory _ deflects _ ) .",
    "the world line of a ray light is a geodesic of the 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "however , the equivalence principle for the bending of light does not refer to the world line , but contains a statement about the ray trajectory in 3-space .",
    "as we will see , the trajectory in 3-space is not a geodesic .",
    "thus the angle between the trajectory and a parallel transported direction changes along the trajectory .",
    "therefore , the equivalence principle should be regarded as a statement about this angle , which is a geometric ( invariant ) object of 3-space .",
    "our first task will be to determinate the trajectory of a light ray in the curved 3-space , together with its affine parameter ( that is , the length of the trajectory ) .",
    "then we will calculate the parallel transport of a vector along the trajectory of the light .",
    "finally we will show that a light ray deflects at the angle predicted by the equivalence principle .",
    "we will work in a weak gravitational field geometry described by the static metric @xmath20 where the 3-space metric includes the post - newtonian parameter @xmath21 that is equal to 1 in general relativity @xcite .",
    "we can use @xmath21 to track the spatial geometry contribution to the bending of light .",
    "the behavior of a light ray is obtained from the equation for null geodesics .",
    "equivalently , we can start from the first integral @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an affine parameter .",
    "let us consider a ray satisfying the initial conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for simplicity , we will consider a region where the gravitational field is nearly uniform : @xmath26 , so @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are conserved magnitudes . initially",
    "( at @xmath30 , @xmath7 ) eq .",
    "( [ momentos ] ) reads @xmath31 because @xmath27 and @xmath28 are conserved , eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) implies that @xmath32 for all value of @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ momentos ] ) becomes @xmath34 if we retain only terms to first - order in @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 and @xmath37 because @xmath38 implies that @xmath39 we have @xmath40 after a displacement @xmath16 , the slope of the trajectory @xmath41 is @xmath42 this result clearly separates the equivalence principle contribution due to @xmath43 from the one associated with the spatial geometry which is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "both contributions are equal in general relativity .",
    "any trajectory in the 3-space can be characterized by its tangent 3-vector @xmath44 whose components are @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) ; the affine parameter @xmath47 is the length of the trajectory . in the 3-space of the static metric ( [ metric ] ) , the infinitesimal length of the trajectory ( [ trayectoria ] ) is @xmath48 dx^{2}\\,.\\ ] ] thus",
    ", @xmath49 is @xmath50 dx\\,,\\ ] ] and the 3-vector @xmath44 that is tangent to the ray trajectory is    @xmath51    we can easily verify that the covariant derivative @xmath52 does not vanish , so the trajectory of the light ray is not a geodesic in 3-space .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the bending of light is measured by the angle between the trajectory and a direction that is parallel transported along it .",
    "so we are going to parallel transport the 3-vector @xmath53 along the 3-curve described by the tangent vector @xmath44 .",
    "this parallel transport is defined by the equation @xmath54 where @xmath55 are the christoffel symbols associated with the 3-space geometry .",
    "the only non - zero christoffel symbols in which we are interested are @xmath56    let us choose @xmath57 as the initial condition at @xmath58 @xmath7 .",
    "thus the solution of eq .",
    "( [ paralelo ] ) is    @xmath59    the angle between the directions of @xmath60 and the trajectory is @xmath61^{1/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ { } & & = ( 1 - 2 \\gamma g z(x ) c^{-2})^{1/2 } ( \\bar{u } ^{x } \\bar{v}^{x}+\\bar{u}^{z } \\bar{v}^{z } ) ( \\bar{u}^{x } \\bar{u}^{x}+\\bar{u}^{z } \\bar{u}^{z})^{-1/2}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we utilized the fact that @xmath62 is preserved by the parallel transport in 3-space .",
    "therefore @xmath63 so the deflection angle after a small displacement @xmath16 is @xmath64 in agreement with the result ( [ onda ] ) obtained by using the equivalence principle .",
    "the use of the equivalence principle can satisfactorily account for the bending of light in the context of the weak gravitational field metric ( [ metric ] ) .",
    "the result from the equivalence principle corresponds to a physically meaningful quantity : it is the angle formed by the trajectory of the light ray and a direction that is parallel transported along that trajectory in 3-space .",
    "the post - newtonian parameter @xmath21 does not enter the deflection angle , although it obviously affects both the trajectory and the parallel transport . in this way , any metric theory of gravity that leads to the weak field behavior of eq .",
