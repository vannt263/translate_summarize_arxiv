    "<S> we show that , under achievable experimental conditions , a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of polar molecules can exhibit dielectric character . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we derive a set of self - consistent mean - field equations that couple the condensate density to its electric dipole field , leading to the emergence of polarization modes that are coupled to the rich quasiparticle spectrum of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> while the usual roton instability is suppressed in this system , the coupling can give rise to a phonon - like instability that is characteristic of a dielectric material with a negative static dielectric function .    </S>",
    "<S> the electrical properties of any material are encoded in its dielectric function @xmath0 , which relates the induced dipole moments within the material to an applied electric field with wave vector @xmath1 and frequency @xmath2 . for its predicted relationship to a variety of novel physical phenomena , </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of @xmath3 taking on negative values has generated much interest . </S>",
    "<S> for the ac case , it is well known that the dielectric function can become negative , for example , at frequencies near an atomic resonance , resulting in the high reflectivity of metals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , under specially engineered circumstances the magnetic permeability of certain materials can become negative , resulting in a negative index of refraction  @xcite .    for a dc field </S>",
    "<S> , however , the existence of a negative dielectric function becomes more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> formally , in the infinite - wavelength limit @xmath4 , a material is stabilized only if its dielectric function , or constant , is non - negative  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such is not necessarily the case for @xmath5 , however , where the dielectric constant may take on negative values without violating causality  @xcite . the presence of a negative dielectric constant ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> is predicted to significantly alter the electrical properties of materials by , for example , giving rise to the attraction of like charges within a material . in this case , the negative dielectric constant is thought to have profound implications for the maximum critical temperature for superconductivity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally testing such assertions has proven difficult , although the dc limit has been approached in certain materials  @xcite .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that the realm of negative dielectric constant can be studied in soon - to - be constructed ultracold molecule experiments , in which electrically polar molecules are produced in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider molecules whose permanent dipole moments are easily aligned in sufficiently weak applied fields . in this case , the molecules exert fields on one another that are comparable to the applied field , and the bec acquires dielectric as well as superfluid character . </S>",
    "<S> we show that altering either the density of the gas or the strength of the applied field can drive the dielectric constant of the system to be negative , triggering a long - wavelength instability of the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> this instability is qualitatively completely different than those that have been studied previously in dipolar becs with fixed dipole moments , being the phonon  @xcite and roton instabilities  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the decay times of this dielectric instability are found to be relatively long , allowing for this state to be observed and studied in detail . </S>",
    "<S> critical in our analysis is the emergence of polarization modes that are coupled to quasiparticle excitations of the bec . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we show that nontrivial physics emerges in the system of ultracold polar molecules in small fields , and motivate the exploration of this regime , or the regime of the dielectric superfluid , for future experiments .    as a qualitative guide , we first consider a homogeneous dielectric placed in an applied field . </S>",
    "<S> this system is characterized by the well - known clausius - mossotti relation , which expresses the dielectric constant @xmath3 in terms of the polarizability @xmath7 of the microscopic constituents , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number density of the dielectric  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cm ] ) suggests that large enough values of @xmath10 could drive the dielectric constant of the homogeneous material to be negative . as discussed in  @xcite , this is indeed possible for materials with static dielectric functions @xmath11 with small but non - zero wave - number ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> most dielectric materials such as ceramics , glasses and plastics have @xmath13 , mostly due to their large densities  @xcite , while most gases have @xmath14 because their densities are very small . </S>",
    "<S> gases of heteronuclear polar molecules , however , can realize large values of @xmath10 due to their possibly large polarizabilities , resulting in very large dielectric constants for these systems even in the dilute gaseous state where @xmath9 is small .    </S>",
    "<S> the heteronuclear molecules that we consider here possess permanent dipolar moments @xmath15 in their body - fixed frames . in the absence of an applied electric field , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of each molecule is a parity eigenstate and the orientations of the molecular dipole moments average to zero in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of an applied electric field mixes the molecular parity states , and the average dipole orientation becomes nonzero . because the energy splitting between these states , @xmath16 , can be very small , the resulting molecular polarizabilities can be very large ( see table  [ candidatemolecules ] for examples ) </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , this polarizability is distinct from the more familiar polarizability , which is on the order of 1 - 100 a.u . , and arises solely from the electric degrees of freedom . in a weak electric field </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 , the molecules then acquire a laboratory - frame dipole moment @xmath18 characterized by the molecular polarizability @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the limiting value of the molecular dipole moment in large applied fields and @xmath16 is the splitting of the parity doublet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this polarizability is an intrinsic property of a heteronuclear molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the molecular dipole moment in the laboratory frame is therefore uniquely determined by the local electric field via the polarizability @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> while the gas of heteronuclear polar molecules can possess a large polarizability due to the small parity splittings , this feature is quickly lost at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a _ thermal _ </S>",
    "<S> gas of polar molecules , at temperatures @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , has both parity states equally populated , causing the dipolar character of the system to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> however , in an ultracold , bose - condensed gas the lower molecular state can be dominantly populated , thus realizing high polarizability @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , polar molecules , at sufficiently low temperature , can exhibit polarizability and hence dielectric character , albeit from a different microscopic origin than atoms or non - polar molecules .    to deal with the properties of this inhomogeneous dielectric system </S>",
    "<S> , we can not simply employ the results derived for a homogeneous material . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore begin by considering a generalized dielectric formalism . </S>",

    "<S> the ground state of this system is found by minimizing the total energy with respect to any variation of @xmath51 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ dfieldgen ] ) is satisfied when @xmath56 and , by construction , @xmath57 is a vector lagrange multiplier with units of electric field . now , a wave function @xmath45 that minimizes the total energy of this system is found by setting @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> interestingly , we see that these equations couple the condensate wave function to the dipole field , so a change in density can result in a change in the dipole moment of the polar molecules , and vice versa . in the strong field limit of fully polarized dipoles , however , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in this case , eq .
