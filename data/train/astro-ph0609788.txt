    "the contribution of the carbon shell to the s - process is important because the nuclei synthesized in this site will be eventually ejected largely unmodified during a supernova explosion of the star due to the lack of a neutron source during the explosive burning . @xcite argued on the basis of the calculations by @xcite that only stars of mass about 25 @xmath0 are able to eject the s - nuclei synthesized in the c - shell .",

    "we have also used some of the extrapolated data given by @xcite in their table 2 .",
    "3 .   in our previous evolutionary calculations ( emt04 ) ,",
    "we investigated the effect of two different @xmath4 reaction rates : the nacre rate and that due to @xcite .",
    "the first rate is larger than the second in the temperature range t=(1 - 4)@xmath1710@xmath18 k ( fig . 1 of emt04 ) , which is relevant to core he - burning in the massive stars under consideration",

    "finally , the case labeled 25 nm , where mass loss has been neglected during the evolution , has the lowest value x(@xmath3c)=0.193 .",
    "this relatively reduced value is due to the higher central temperature achieved during core helium burning ( see emt04 for more details ) .",

    "a more detailed discussion of the effect of @xmath21 is available in emt04 . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate its effect on the s - process itself .",
    "our results are presented in  [ sec : she ] and  [ sec : spcshell ] .",
    "4 .   in our previous calculation of the s - process ( tem00 )",
    ", we adopted a rate for the neutron - capture reaction @xmath22 based on a cross section @xmath23 = 0.20 @xmath24 according to @xcite .",
    "however , in our present calculations , we have used the new rate for this reaction as obtained by @xcite .",

    "our results agree with this conclusion and are described in  [ sec : she ] .",
    "another difference with our previous work ( tem00 ) on the s - process concerns the reactions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the first reaction is known to be the main neutron source of the s - process in massive stars , while the second is a competing reaction since it captures part of the alpha particles .",
    "+ figure [ fig : ne22rate ] illustrates the rate of the @xmath28 reaction , where the nacre rate is lower than that obtained by cf88 in the temperatures range below t@xmath30 , a regime that comprises most of the core he - burning phase in the stars under consideration . however , the nacre rate is larger by a factor of up to three in the temperature range t@xmath31 , which is relevant to the more advanced burning phases , in particular the core and the shell carbon - burning .",
    "[ fig : ne22rate ] displays the rate according to @xcite , which shows some characteristics similar to the nacre rate , although systematically slightly lower .",

    "sec : she ] , we show that the s - process yields do strongly depend on the value of the @xmath28 reaction rate .    in our evolutionary calculations ( emt04 ) , we have made a special effort to analyze the effects of several important physical quantities on the internal structure of the stellar models .",
    "besides considering the variation in @xmath4 as described above , we have investigated the effects of mass loss on the structure of the stellar models .",
    "mass loss is certainly important for stars more massive than 15 @xmath0 , especially if the star evolves on the kelvin - helmholtz time scale to the red giant stage , where mass loss is known to increase significantly . as shown in our previous paper ( emt04 ) , a rapid evolution to the red giant branch",
    "occurs when the effect of the gradient of molecular weight is taken into account . in this case , the ledoux criterion for convection inhibits the convective instability in the region of the hydrogen - burning shell .",
    "such evolution is found in the calculation by @xcite for the 15 and 25 @xmath0 stars .",
    "we find that mass loss has an insignificant effect on the s - process during core he - burning .",
    "however , as we shall see in  [ sec : spcshell ] , the characteristics of shell - carbon burning are influenced , which may affect the s - process in turn .",
    "it is worth updating our previous results ( tem00 ) of the s - process during core helium burning in massive stars , mainly because many reaction rates determining the s - process efficiency have been revised as described in ",
    "[ sec : smodels ] .",
    "table [ tab : hesprocess ] presents a comparison of some key physical quantities characterizing the efficiency of the s - process during core he - burning for the stars indicated . comparing our new results with the former ones , labeled tem00 in table [ tab : hesprocess ] ,",
    "we see that the new results show a significantly reduced s - process efficiency .",
    "in particular , we obtain in the case of the 25 @xmath0 star ( case 25c ) an overproduction factor of 618 for @xmath2kr compared to 1100 in our former calculations ( tem00 ) .",
    "this remarkable decrease by a factor of 1.8 is mainly due to the larger rate of @xmath22 used in the present study .",
    "both the present calculation ( 25c ) and that in tem00 used the same rate for the @xmath28 reaction . therefore neutron capture on @xmath27o is an efficient sink of neutrons , especially during the advanced stage of core he - burning .",
    "it is interesting to note that found a reduction of 1.2 to 1.6 due to this neutron sink .",
    "hence , the statement in our previous work ( tem00 ) that most of the neutrons captured by @xmath27o will be returned by the reaction @xmath33 is not fully justified because it was based on one - zone calculations in which the effect of convection was neglected .    in tables",
    "[ tab : hesprocess ] and [ tab : spresults ] we show the effect of the lower nacre rate for the @xmath28 reaction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ne22rate ] ) as compared with that due to cf88 in the temperature range up to t@xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that the nacre rate leads to a significantly reduced s - process efficiency : for example , table [ tab : hesprocess ] shows that the overproduction of @xmath2kr in the case of the 25 @xmath0 star is 174 with the nacre rate while it is 618 with the rate of cf88 , a reduction by a factor of 3.6 .",
    "the low overproduction value is rather close to that obtained by . in their calculations for an 8 @xmath0 helium star",
    "( corresponding roughly to an initial mass of 25 @xmath0 ) , they used the same rate as we do for @xmath22 and considered different rates for @xmath4 .",

    "[ fig : ne22rate ] .",
    "taking the `` adopted '' nacre rate for @xmath4 ( 1.92 times larger than that of cf88 at t@xmath19=0.3 ) , they found an overproduction factor of 92 for @xmath2kr .",
    "however , when they used the lower limit on the nacre rate for @xmath4 ( 1.16@xmath17 of cf88 ) the overproduction factor increased to 180 . the difference between their results and our 25n model demonstrates the importance of the @xmath28 rate .",

    "[ sec : smodels ] .",
    "one conclusion we may draw from the discussion above is that the efficiency of the s - process during core he - burning in massive stars depends crucially on the neutron production reaction @xmath28 and on the neutron - sink reaction @xmath22 .",
    "both reactions become effective during the late stage of core he - burning where the @xmath27o becomes abundant . fortunately",
    ", the present uncertainty in the @xmath4 does not have a significant effect on the s - process efficiency , as indicated by the comparison of the results of the two cases  present work , nacre \" and  present work , ( 25k ) \" in which the rate for this reaction is different as described in  [ sec : smodels ] .",
    "table [ tab : hesprocess ] show that the efficiency of the s - process is remarkably reduced for all the masses considered .",
    "it is worth analyzing our results of the s - process when the nacre rate is applied for the @xmath28 reaction instead of using the cf88 rate . fig . [",
    "fig : corehe ] displays several physical quantities as a function of the central helium mass fraction as obtained for the 25 @xmath0 models 25n and 25c during core he - burning .",
    "the larger rate by cf88 leads to an increase in the neutron density ( see fig . [",
    "fig : corehe]b ) at larger helium mass fraction ( or at earlier time ) .",
    "consequently , a higher neutron exposure , @xmath37 ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : corehe]c ) is achieved leading to an earlier increase of the overproduction of @xmath2kr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corehe]d ) .",
    "in other words , despite the higher peak neutron density achieved in case of the nacre rate , the s - process is less robust because the neutron exposure is lower due to the shorter time scale until the end core he - burning .",
    "the conclusion of this discussion is that the s - process during he - burning in massive stars is a race against time since the whole process occurs during the late stage of this phase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ocorehe ] we present the overabundances of heavy nuclei averaged over the convective helium burning core for models 15n , 20n , 25n , and 30n , and in tables [ tab : spresults ] and [ tab : spsummary ] we list the overabundances of selected nuclei at the end of the core helium burning .",
    "the figures show that the larger the stellar mass , the more efficient is the neutron - capture of the s - process .",
    "the figures also show the well - known feature of the weak s - process that the overabundance distribution in the mass range a = 60 - 90 has a peak at @xmath2kr .",

    "both methods fit the s - only nuclei of solar abundances . in the classical approach , seed nuclei",
    "are exposed with three exponential distributions of neutron exposures ( the main , the weak , and the strong component ) , whereas in the stellar models seed nuclei are exposed with a single exposure in massive stars @xcite and an exponential exposure from repeated thermal pulses in the low - mass agb stars @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to know how good the s - only nuclei overproduction factors of each stellar model at the end of core helium burning , at the end of core oxygen burning , and their imf - averaged are relative to the best overall fit to the s - only solar abundance distribution . in fig .",
    "[ fig : overprodfits ] we present the best - fit overproduction factor distribution of model 30n at the end of core helium burning ( panel a ) , of the imf - averaged of our stellar models at the end of core helium burning ( panel b ) , of model 25n at the end of core oxygen burning ( to include s - process results from core helium and shell carbon burnings , panel c ) , and of the imf - averaged of our stellar models at the end of core oxygen burning ( panel d ) . in panel d , instead of model 25n for the 25 @xmath0 contribution ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cshelln0fit ] ) , we take model 25k for testing the effect of @xmath3c(@xmath35,@xmath57)@xmath27o reaction in fitting the s - only solar abundance .",
    "model 30n ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overprodfits]a ) produces the best s - only solar distribution fit with @xmath157=176 among 15n , 20n , 25n , 25k , and 30n models for yields at the end of core helium burning .",
    "model 30n also produces a better fit than the imf - averaged of models at the end of core helium burning ( @xmath157=205 , fig .",
    "[ fig : overprodfits]b ) , mostly due to the large @xmath157 contribution from the 15 and 20 @xmath0 models .    model 25k ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overprodfits]c ) produces the best fit to the s - only solar distribution with @xmath157=161 among 15n , 20n , 25n , 25k , and 30n models for yields at the end of core oxygen burning .",
    "we also find the overproduction of s - only nuclei of the imf - averaged of models at the end of core oxygen burning ( @xmath157=153 ) gives a better fit to the s - only solar distribution than the overproductions of the imf - averaged of models at the end of core helium burning ( @xmath157=206 ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath157 between the fits in the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : overprodfits ] being larger than 8 are quite significant since the differences only involve 6 data points for the weak component .",
    "we conclude that including shell carbon burning s - processing indeed gives a better fit to the s - only solar distribution nuclei than using yields from the core helium burning s - process only .",
    "also imf - averaging is necessary to give a better fit to the solar abundance distribution ( as can be seen by comparing the @xmath157 and the spread from min to max of overproduction factors of panel c with the distribution of panel d ) .",
    "furthermore , the overproduction factors x / x@xmath142 @xmath8 0.5 for nuclei with 60 @xmath7 a @xmath7 90 suggest that solar abundances of nuclei in this mass range are dominantly produced by the s - processing in massive stars ( see also table [ tab : imfcomparesolar ] ) .",
    "tables [ tab : spresults ] , [ tab : spsummary ] , and [ tab : spyield ] summarize our results on the s - process in the massive stars under consideration . in table",
    "[ tab : spresults ] , we emphasize the following points :    * a comparison between the overabundance obtained at the end of core he - burning in 25n and 25k shows that the reaction @xmath4 has only a small influence on the efficiency of the s - process during this phase . in contrast , the efficiency of the s - process during shell c - burning is very sensitive to the mass fraction of carbon left over at the end of core he - burning , which is determined by this reaction . *",
    "the overabundances we have obtained in our case 25c at the end of core he - burning are similar to those calculated by @xcite .",
    "but our results of the shell c - burning are different from those by raiteri et al .",
    "( 1991b ) , since they have done essentially a one - zone calculation at fixed temperature and density . *",
    "table [ tab : spsummary ] indicates that the s - process during core he - burning leads to a monotonic increase of the overabundance as a function of stellar mass .",
    "however , this does not apply in the case of shell c - burning because branchings along the s - process path become effective as a result of the higher neutron density encountered during this phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ndin25n ] ) .",
    "the behavior of the overabundance of @xmath159cu , @xmath90zn , @xmath2kr , @xmath93sr , and @xmath10gd indicates this feature . * in table [ tab : spyield ] , we summarize the stellar yield compared to solar of the listed nuclei as obtained by integration above 1.5 @xmath0 for each stellar mass .",
    "their overproduction factor distribution as function of mass number a are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : syield ] .",
    "the dependence of this yield on the stellar mass reflects the behavior of the overabundance described above .",
    "relatively high yield is obtained for the pure s - nuclei .",
    "we emphasize the remarkable difference by a factor 4.2 in the yield for @xmath2kr resulting from the sequences 25n and 25k at the end of core oxygen burning .",
    "the reason is the destruction of @xmath2kr by shell c - burning in the sequence 25n and its production in 25k .",
    "this is seen in fig . [",
    "fig : finalx ] , where the normalized mass fractions are displayed as a function of the interior mass in the sequences 25n and 25k at the end of core oxygen burning .",
    "note also the difference in the mass fraction of @xmath5zn between the two sequences , which we have attributed to the different neutron densities encountered during shell c - burning as discussed above in ",
    "[ sec : spcshell ] .",
    "* it is quite remarkable that @xmath10gd , produced abundantly ( overabundance @xmath818 ) during core helium burning in massive stars , is brought back to its solar value at the end of shell carbon burning due to the larger @xmath10eu(n,@xmath57 ) rate during shell carbon burning , which causes the s - process flow to bypass @xmath10gd .",
    "this result is reasonable since s - processing in thermally - pulsed agb stars produces enough @xmath10gd to account for its solar abundance @xcite .",
    "a similar case also occurs for @xmath160dy , which has an overabundance value of larger than 10 in all models studied at the end of core helium burning but decreases to an overabundance of less than solar after shell carbon burning . production of @xmath160dy occurs in the s - process because @xmath161gd , which is stable in the lab , can @xmath70 decay in stars .",
    "the rate for this decay is temperature and density dependent @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this rate is lower in the conditions of shell carbon burning than is core helium burning .",
    "moreover , the neutron - capture rate for @xmath161gd increases with the higher temperature and density of the carbon shell .",
    "these effects cause the s - process flow to bypass @xmath160gd during carbon burning . *",
    "the opposite case of @xmath10gd is for isotope @xmath162cd , which is destroyed almost completely during core helium burning to an overabundance of less than 0.002 , but then reproduced to a value close to solar after shell carbon burning due to a higher neutron - capture rate of @xmath163cd during shell carbon burning .",
    "a case similar to but less dramatic than @xmath162cd is @xmath95zr , which is destroyed during core helium burning to an overabundance @xmath70.4 then recovers to an overabundance @xmath1311 at the end of shell carbon burning .",
    "* an interesting feature of the s - process in shell carbon burning is the strong enhancement of @xmath2se , @xmath94kr , and @xmath6rb to an overabundance larger than 10 from a value of @xmath91 at the end of core helium burning ( see also @xcite ) . *",
    "another significant feature of shell carbon burning is the overabundances of @xmath41na and @xmath44al .",
    "the overabundance of @xmath41na is less than 10 at the end of core helium burning .",
    "it is enhanced significantly to a value larger than 230 in all models studied here .",
    "a similar result is also obtained for @xmath44al overabundance which rises from 1.5 to 75 .",
    "our detailed study of the s - process nucleosynthesis resulting from core he - burning and shell c - burning in massive stars on the basis of the updated nuclear data of some relevant reactions reveal many interesting points which we summarize in the following .",
    "* the efficiency of s - process nucleosynthesis during core he - burning does not depend on the rate of @xmath4 but it is sensitive to the rates of @xmath28 and @xmath22 . when we use the updated rates of these two reactions , as described in  [ sec : smodels ] , we find a significantly reduced efficiency of the s - process during core he - burning ( see table [ tab : hesprocess ] ) . *",
    "the s - process in shell c - burning is more complicated and depends on the evolution of the massive star beyond core he - burning .",
    "this complexity can be seen from the locations , the number of carbon convective shells , and the thickness of carbon convective shells in our models .",
    "these in turn are sensitive to the central carbon mass fraction x@xmath164 achieved at the end of core he - burning as a result of the reaction @xmath4 , whose rate is not yet adequately determined .",
    "if this rate leads to a relatively lower x@xmath164 , then the s - process occurs later in time , possibly even after central neon burning .",
    "consequently , the neutrons density achieved is high enough ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ndin25n ] ) to drive the nuclear reaction flow to the zirconium region .",
    "this does not happen when x@xmath164 is higher , as in our case 25k , since the s - process occurs here earlier in time ( before central neon ignition ) and at lower temperatures and densities , which result in a smaller neutron density .",
    "this explains why the nuclear reaction flow stops essentially in the strontium region . *",
    "our calculations show that the overabundance of @xmath5zn can be used as indicator of the strength of the nuclear reaction flow through the branchings along the s - process path , especially at @xmath88zn .",
    "we have also found that @xmath6rb is strongly produced during shell carbon burning due to the higher rate of neutron - capture of @xmath94rb relative to its rate during core helium burning @xcite . *",
    "we measure the s - processing in the core helium , shell helium , and shell carbon burning in massive stars with @xmath139 and show their relative strengths or importance .",
    "we show the s - process contribution from shell carbon burning decreases with increasing mass of the star . * in comparing the yields of s - only nuclei of our stellar models with the solar distribution",
    ", we find that it is necessary to include the results of s - processing from shell carbon burning and to mix the yields of all mass range of massive stars to give a reasonable fit to the solar distribution . for s - only nuclei with mass number a@xmath787 ,",
    "massive stars contribute at least 40% to the solar s - only nuclei . for s - only nuclei with mass number a@xmath890 ,",

    "<S> we present a detailed study of s - process nucleosynthesis in massive stars of solar - like initial composition and masses 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we update our previous results of s - process nucleosynthesis during the core he - burning of these stars and then focus on an analysis of the s - process under the physical conditions encountered during the shell - carbon burning . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the recent compilation of the @xmath1 rate leads to a remarkable reduction of the efficiency of the s - process during core he - burning . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this rate leads to the lowest overproduction factor of @xmath2kr found to date during core he - burning in massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> the s - process yields resulting from shell carbon burning turn out to be very sensitive to the structural evolution of the carbon shell . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is influenced by the mass fraction of @xmath3c attained at the end of core helium burning , which in turn is mainly determined by the @xmath4 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the still present uncertainty in the rate for this reaction implies that the s - process in massive stars is also subject to this uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we identify some isotopes like @xmath5zn and @xmath6rb as the signatures of the s - process during shell carbon burning in massive stars . in determining the relative contribution of our s - only stellar yields to the solar abundances , </S>",
    "<S> we find it is important to take into account the neutron exposure of shell carbon burning . </S>",
    "<S> when we analyze our yields with a salpeter initial mass function , we find that massive stars contribute at least 40% to s - only nuclei with mass a @xmath7 87 . for s - only nuclei with mass a @xmath8 90 </S>",
    "<S> , massive stars contribute on average @xmath97% , except for @xmath10gd , @xmath11os , and @xmath12hg which are @xmath914% , @xmath913% , and @xmath911% , respectively . </S>"
