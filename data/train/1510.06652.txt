    "this article is based on two recent papers by philip diessner , wojciech kotlarski , dominik stckinger and myself  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a higgs - boson candidate with a mass near 125 gev by both atlas and cms collaborations at the lhc in 2012 @xcite seemingly completes the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "so far the properties of the new state are within experimental errors consistent with the predictions of the sm .",
    "nevertheless , the true nature of the discovered state has to be thoroughly explored .",
    "the run 2 of the lhc ( and later the high - lumi run ) should clarify if the couplings of the new state are exactly as predicted by the sm , whether it unitarizes the ww scattering amplitude , or not , and eventually discover new particles .",
    "although the sm is able to describe a vast number of experimental measurements , there are many questions which can not be address : e.g. dark matter , baryogenesis etc .",
    "in particular , the question of stabilization of the higgs boson mass with respect to the planck scale has fueled theoretical speculations on beyond the sm physics . among these ,",
    "the tev - scale supersymmetry is one of the most theoretically and experimentally studied options .",
    "so far no direct signal of supersymmetry has been observed by the lhc experiments , and only limits on superpartner masses have been derived .",
    "however those limits should be taken with a grain of salt as the experimental analyses were performed for simplified models with many additional assumptions .",
    "the current limits may be not valid in more general supersymmetric scenarios and dedicated phenomenological studies are required for non - minimal models . in fact",
    "the absence of any direct signal of supersymmetric particle production at the lhc , and the measured higgs boson mass @xmath0125 gev close to the upper value of @xmath0135 gev achievable in the mssm , are a strong motivation to consider non - minimal susy scenarios .",
    "@xmath1-symmetric supersymmetric models , invariant under a global @xmath2 transformation @xmath3 , are particularly well motivated .",
    "@xmath1-invariance is indeed a symmetry @xcite of all basic building blocks of the supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "this symmetry is stronger than r - parity because forbids not only baryon- and lepton - number changing terms in the superpotential , as well as dim-5 operators mediating proton decay , but also removes left - right sfermion mixing , the higgsino @xmath4-term and majorana gaugino masses . as a result ,",
    "several of the most important experimental constraints on supersymmetry are alleviated : contributions to cp- and flavor - violating observables can be suppressed even in presence of flavor violation in the sfermion sector , and the production cross section for squarks reduced , making squarks below the tev scale generically compatible with lhc data .    since this is the write - up of a lecture given at a school , the next section is devoted to a brief exposition of the mrssm structure .",
    "then we address the problem of confronting the mrssm with the observed higgs boson mass in accordance with electroweak precision measurements .",
    "this is not an obvious task since , as to be seen in the next section , in the mrssm the lightest higgs boson tree - level mass is typically reduced compared to the mssm due to the mixing with additional scalars . moreover , an important mssm mechanism of generating large radiative corrections due to the stop mixing is absent , and r - symmetry necessarily introduces an su(2 ) scalar triplet , which can increase @xmath5 already at the tree level .",
    "nevertheless , in refs .",
    "@xcite a number of benchmark points illustrating different viable parameter regions have been identified and verified that they are not excluded by further experimental constraints from higgs observables , collider and low - energy physics . in this",
    "write - up we will show the results for only one of the benchmarks bmp1 corresponding to @xmath6 ; for other bmp s we refer to our original publications , where a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space is discussed and a complete list of references can also be found .",
    "we conclude with summary and outlook .",
    "under the global @xmath2 r - symmetry the grassmann coordinate in the superspace @xmath7 transforms as @xmath3 . by convention",
    "we can sign the r - charge 1 ( @xmath8 ) to the coordinate @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "if a super field @xmath11 has a well defined r - charge @xmath12 , so that it transforms as @xmath13 the component fields must transform differently . obviously , the scalar component @xmath14 has r - charge @xmath12 , the fermionic component @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) has r - charge @xmath12@xmath171 ( @xmath12 + 1 ) , etc .",
    "for the gauge invariant kinetic term of a chiral super field @xmath18 ( irrespectively of its r - charge ) @xmath19 to be r - invariant , the gauge vector super field @xmath20 must be uncharged under r - symmetry .",
    "since @xmath21 , the gauge vector field @xmath22 is uncharged , while the gaugino @xmath23 must carry r - charge + 1 .",
    "then the kinetic term for the gauge superfields @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the the gauge superfield stress tensor @xmath26 , is also automatically r - invariant . on the other hand , the majorana gaugino mass terms @xmath27 are forbidden in the soft - susy breaking lagrangian .",
    "however , dirac mass terms @xmath28 are perfectly allowed if additional fermions @xmath29 with opposite r - charge in the adjoint representations of each gauge group factor are introduced .",
    "this can be achieved by introducing gauge chiral - superfield adjoints @xmath30 corresponding to su(3)@xmath31 , su(2)@xmath32 and u(1 ) , respectively , each with r - charge 0",
    ". such a construction amounts to promoting the gauge / gaugino sector to the n=2 supersymmetric structure , which necessarily brings in new scalars , i.e. for each group factor , apart from gauge vector fields and gauge dirac fermions , there are scalars in the adjoint representations .",
    "the mrssm therefore contains sgluons  color - octet scalars,@xmath33 , a scalar su(2 ) triplet @xmath34 , and a scalar singlet @xmath35 .",
    "the asignment of r - charges to the matter chiral superfields is model dependent . in the minimal @xmath1-symmetric supersymmetric standard model ( mrssm )",
    "@xcite it is done in such a way that all sm particles have r charge 0 ( in analogy to discrete r - parity ) .",
    "thus the left - chiral quark and lepton superfields have r - charge 1 and left - chiral higgs superfields have r - charge 0 . with this assignment the standard yukawa terms in the superpotential",
    "are perfectly allowed , while all baryon- and lepton - number violating terms , as well as dimension - five operators mediating proton decay are forbidden .",
    "for the same reason the standard higgs / higgsino @xmath4 term is also forbidden .",
    "therefore , to generate r - symmetric @xmath4 terms ( and consequently higgsino mass terms ) , the higgs sector of the mrssm is extended by adding two iso - doublet superfields @xmath36 and @xmath37 with r - charge 2 ( to be called r - higgs ) . in all , the spectrum of fields in the r - symmetric supersymmetry theory consists of the standard mssm matter , higgs and gauge superfields augmented by chiral adjoints @xmath30 and two r - higgs iso - doublets .",
    "the r - charges of the superfields and their component fields are listed in table  [ tab : rcharges ] .",
    ".the r - charges of the superfields and the corresponding bosonic and fermionic components .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the mrssm superpotential takes the following form @xmath38 note that the @xmath39-terms are similar to the usual yukawa terms , where the @xmath40-higgs and @xmath41 or @xmath42 play the role of the quark / lepton doublets and singlets . they will turn to be instrumental in achieving the required higgs boson mass .    turning to soft - susy breaking ,",
    "the usual soft mass terms of the mssm scalar fields are allowed just like in the mssm .",
    "similarly , the soft susy breaking @xmath43 , the higgs , the adjoint scalar and r - higgs scalar masses are consistent with r - symmetry .",
    "although the holomorphic soft mass terms for the adjoint scalars , like @xmath44 , are also allowed , for simplicity we will neglect them , as well as their trilinear couplings among themselves and to the higgs bosons since their presence does not influence our results significantly . on the other hand",
    "all trilinear scalar couplings involving higgs bosons to squarks and sleptons , which in the mssm are notoriously unwanted sources of flavor violation , are removed since they carry non - vanishing r - charge . likewise , the bilinear coupling of the r - higgs has r - charge 4 and therefore is forbidden as well .",
    "the @xmath43 term is thus the only one which destroys the exchange symmetry between the @xmath45 and r - higgs fields .",
    "the soft - susy breaking scalar mass terms that we take read @xmath46 although the familiar mssm weyl fermions @xmath47 can not receive the soft majorana masses , they can be paired with the corresponding fermionic component of the chiral adjoints @xmath48 .",
    "when the dirac mass terms are generated by @xmath49-type spurions , additional terms with auxiliary @xmath50-fields appear in the lagrangian @xmath51 when the auxiliary fields are eliminated via equations of motion the dirac mass parameters enter the scalar sector as well .",
    "since the r - higgs fields carry non - vanishing r - charge , they do not develop vacuum expectation values ( vev ) .",
    "the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking is triggered only by the vev s of neutral ew scalar fields , parameterized as @xmath52   & t^0   =   \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } } ( v_t + \\phi_t + i   \\sigma_t ) , \\quad     & s    =   \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } } ( v_s + \\phi_s + i   \\sigma_s )    .",

    "an approximate formula has been derived @xmath76 in the limiting case of large @xmath77 and assuming @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "it is clear that the mssm upper limit of @xmath82 at tree level can be substantially reduced by terms depending on the new model parameters .",
    "therefore in the mrssm loop corrections must play even more significant role , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "the parameters of the model are renormalized in the @xmath83 scheme and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath64 and @xmath53 are given by the minimum of the loop - corrected effective potential .",

    "the one - loop self energies have been computed exactly using ` feynarts `  @xcite , ` formcalc ` @xcite and feynman rules generated by ` sarah ` @xcite properly modified to match our model .",
    "since the above equation can not be solved analytically for @xmath89 , the solution has to be found numerically . with ` sarah ` an mrssm version of the ` spheno ` spectrum generator",
    "@xcite has been created to calculate the mass spectrum at full one - loop level .",
    "the results have been checked with a recent framework ` flexiblesusy ` @xcite .    before presenting numerical results of full one - loop calculations , it is instructive to discuss the self energies in the effective potential approach . in the mssm",
    "the dominant one - loop contribution to the higgs mass matrix comes from the top / stop sector . in the mrssm",
    "they are also important but because of the absence of stop mixing they are simpler @xmath90 and , as a result , for the same stop mass can not reach the value as high as in the mssm .",
    "since the mrssm superpotential contains new @xmath91 and @xmath92 terms with a yukawa - like structure , one can expect additional corrections proportional to @xmath93 and logarithms of soft masses . using the same approximation as in eq.[eq : approx_treehiggs ] ,",
    "the lightest higgs state is given mainly by @xmath94 and only @xmath95 component of the mass matrix needs to be computed and simple analytical expressions can be derived .",

    "three representative benchmarks bmp1 , bmp2 , bmp3 have been identified with @xmath103 , respectively , for which the higgs boson mass can be met in accordance with lhc constraints , and with ew precision observables , to be discussed in the next section .",
    "the dependence of the lightest higgs boson mass calculated at tree , one - loop ( and two - loop ) levels for one of the benchmarks , the bmp1 , is shown in fig.[img : comp ] as a function of one of the parameters , with all others set to the benchmark values .",
    "as already mentioned , the tree - level mass is significantly reduced below @xmath104 for large values of @xmath105 , as the mixing between doublets and the singlet and the triplet gets exchanced .",
    "the dependence on @xmath106 is significantly weaker since the lightest higgs gets dominant contribution from @xmath94 even for a low @xmath6 .",
    "the size of one - loop top / stop yukawa contribution alone can be judged from the value read at @xmath107 , since then only stop / top contributions are significant . evidently , a stop mass of 1 tev , as set in the benchmark points , is not enough in the mrssm to achieve the correct value of the higgs boson mass , due to the absence of left - right mixing .",
    "the full one - loop result shows large positive contributions from @xmath108 terms .",
    "although the tree level result falls quadratically with @xmath108 , as expected from eq .",
    "[ eq : approx_treehiggs ] , the one - loop result shows quartic dependence , as seen e.g.  from eq.[eq:1loop ] , which explains the behavior of the sum .",
    "thus the @xmath108 one - loop contributions can push the higgs boson mass to the measured value for values of @xmath109 close to unity .",
    "since the one - loop corrections are large , the question arises about the size of higher - order corrections . in ref .",
    "@xcite an estimate of higher - order corrections has been given with a conclusion that an expected two - loop contribution for the lightest higgs boson mass should not exceed 6 gev .",
    "this estimate has been verified in ref .",
    "@xcite using the recently updated ` sarah ` code @xcite that provides ` spheno ` routines to calculate two - loop corrections in the effective potential approach and the gauge - less limit @xmath110 .    at two - loops",
    ", the @xmath108 corrections should behave in a manner similar to the pure top / stop two - loop contributions in the mssm without stop mixing . and in fact , their numerical impact turns to be rather small , typically below 1 gev , unless the couplings @xmath108 become very large , @xmath111 .",
    "but at two - loops also the strongly interacting sector and strong coupling @xmath112 enter directly to the higgs boson mass predictions and these corrections can be expected to be sizable .",
    "apart from the gluon , they involve the dirac gluino and the sgluon , the scalar component of the octet superfield @xmath113 , which depend on the sgluon soft mass parameter @xmath114 and the dirac mass @xmath115 .",
    "note that @xmath115 appears not only directly as the gluino mass but , via eq .",
    "( [ eq : potdirac ] ) , also in couplings and mass terms of sgluons . in particular , it causes the splitting between the real and imaginary parts of the complex sgluon field @xmath116 , with tree - level masses @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "compared to the mssm , there are important differences due to the dirac nature of the gluino , the lack of left - right stop mixing and the vanishing @xmath4-parameter .",
    "for example , the diagrams with fermion mass insertions , corresponding to @xmath119-type contributions in the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , are not present in the mrssm due to the absence of l - r mixing between squarks ( for a comprehensive discussion of similarities and differences of two - loop results in the mssm and mrssm , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "tev ( thick solid blue line ) and @xmath120  tev ( thick dashed green line ) with all contributions , respectively , and without the sgluon contributions ( thin solid red line ) . for comparison also",
    "the mssm contributions for no ( thin dashed light blue line ) and maximal ( purple dotted line ) stop mixing are plotted .",
    "[ from ref.@xcite],width=226 ]    fig .",
    "[ img:2loop ] shows the gluino mass dependence of the complete two - loop correction to the lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "curves are drawn for two different values of the sgluon mass parameter @xmath121 and 10 gev with all other parameters corresponding to bmp1 .",
    "for comparison , the two - loop result without the sgluon contribution is shown as well , and the mssm result with strong stop mixing and without any sfermion mixing the at tree - level .    in the mssm without sfermion mixing",
    "the gluino contribution is precisely the same as in the mrssm since the dirac or majorana nature of the gluino does not matter as the dirac partner , the octet superfield @xmath122 , has no direct couplings to quark superfields .",
    "this explains why the lines for the mrssm without sgluon and the mssm without stop mixing have very similar @xmath123 dependence .",
    "including the sgluon diagram in the mrssm strongly changes the behavior .",
    "surprisingly , the full mrssm two - loop contributions resemble the mssm contributions with large stop mixing ( corresponding to @xmath124 gev ) , however for different reasons . in the mssm",
    "the increase is due to the additional @xmath119-type diagram which is directly proportional to gluino mass , while in the mrssm , the sgluon diagram grows with @xmath115 , both due to the sgluon - stop - stop coupling , which scales like @xmath115 , and to an increase of the sgluon mass @xmath125 . with the sgluon contributions the total two - loop contributions to the higgs boson mass in the mrssm are larger than the ones in the mssm .",
    "they are further increased by heavy sgluons . with the positive two - loop correction a somewhat smaller value of the @xmath102",
    "is needed to meet the experimentally measured higgs boson mass .",
    "overall , the two - loop contribution amounts to approximately + 5 gev , in agreement with previous estimate , and confirms the validity of the perturbative expansion in spite of the large one - loop result .",
    "since the non - vanishing @xmath53 of the scalar triplet contributes to the tree - level @xmath54 mass and shifts the @xmath55 parameter from 1 , it is constrained to be small : for all our benchmarks it is below 1 gev .",
    "small @xmath53 implies , through tadpole equations , a large value of the triplet soft mass and consequently somewhat split spectrum of higgs bosons . in the sm and the mssm the top yukawa coupling dominates loop corrections to @xmath5 .",
    "therefore it should be expected that due to their yukawa - like character , the @xmath108 couplings will also contribute at loop - level to electroweak observables ( ewo ) , in particular to the @xmath54 boson mass .    beyond tree - level",
    "the @xmath54 boson mass can be obtained from the precisely measured muon decay constant using ( hats denote @xmath126-renormalized quantities in the mrssm ) @xmath127 \\label{w - mass - master - formula2},\\ ] ] where @xmath128 contains only oblique and @xmath129 both oblique and non - oblique corrections which depend on the entire particle content of the model .",
    "the above formula also properly resums leading two - loop sm corrections @xcite .",
    "the numerical calculation of @xmath130 and @xmath129 has been performed with the help of ` sarah ` appropriately modified to account for the triplet scalar contribution .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the one - loop approximation to the @xmath54 boson mass it terms of the electroweak precision parameters @xmath35 , @xmath34 and @xmath131 as @xmath132 where @xmath133 , and @xmath134 is the @xmath54 mass calculated in the sm .",
    "the advantage of computing @xmath135 parameters is that they can be used in the calculation of several ewo .",
    "the main contribution to @xmath5 from the mrssm sector can be described in terms of the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "it receives input from three sectors : charginos / neutralinos , higgs and r - higgs bosons .",
    "the contribution from r - higgses has a similar structure to the stop / sbottom . since in our benchmarks soft masses @xmath136 and @xmath137 are large , the mixing between r - higgses and mass - splitting is small leading to negligible contribution to @xmath34 .",
    "the contribution from the triplet scalar is suppressed by the large soft triplet mass @xmath66 .",
    "the dominant contribution thus comes from the chargino / neutralino sector .",
    "for example , in the simplifying case of @xmath138 and @xmath139 , it can be written as @xmath140    , calculated using full mrssm contributions and different approximations for the @xmath34-parameter for bmp1 ( marked by the black star.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure [ img : mwlam ] shows the @xmath102 dependence of the full calculation of the @xmath54 mass in the mrssm ( black solid line ) , as well as in various approximations .",
    "other lines in the figure contain the full sm contribution , but the mrssm contributions are taken into account either completely , or only via the @xmath34-parameter in various approximations , or from the tree - level triplet vev contribution .",
    "the figure shows that the chargino / neutralino approximation already gives an excellent approximation to the full @xmath34-parameter .",
    "the @xmath34-parameter , together with the tree - level triplet vev contribution , provides a good approximation to the full result .",
    "the remaining difference from non-@xmath34-parameter oblique corrections , vertex and box contributions , and leading higher loop contributions , is within @xmath141  mev , except for @xmath142 .",
    "in my talk i have discussed the structure of the r - symmetric supersymmetric extension of the standard model and recent progress in the precision calculation of the higgs and @xmath54 boson masses . compared to the mssm ,",
    "the model contains new states : r - higgs su(2)-doublets and singlet , su(2)-triplet and su(3)-octet superfields , whose fermionic components allow us to write down the dirac mass terms for gauginos and higgsinos .",
    "we have seen that one can acomodate the observed higgs boson mass in accordance with precision observables .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath143 and @xmath54 impose stringent and non - trivial constraints on the parameter space of the model .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to identify regions in the parameter space which acomodate the measured values and are in accordance with experimental data , as checked explicitly with ` higgsbounds ` @xcite and ` higgssignals ` @xcite , as well as selected low - energy flavor constraints .",
    "we have computed the full one - loop corrections to both @xmath143 and @xmath54 , and the two - loop correction to the higgs mass in the effective potential approach .",
    "numerical calculations have been cross - checked with analytic calculations of the most important new corrections .",
    "we have found that large scalar masses are favorable , of order 1@xmath173 tev .",
    "the resulting large mass ratios enhance loop - corrections to the lightest higgs boson mass and suppress contribution from new states to the @xmath54 boson mass .",
    "most instrumental are the new superpotential couplings @xmath108 , which play a role similar to the top / bottom yukawa couplings with r - higgses and singlet / triplet replacing quark doublets and singlets . with @xmath108 of order 1 , like the top yukawa coupling",
    ", the higgs boson mass of @xmath0125 gev can easily be obtained even for top squarks below 1 tev in spite of lack of l - r sfermion mixing ,    the proposed benchmark points have many of the new states within the reach of the run-2 of the lhc , in particular the supersymmetric fermions .",
    "it would be extremely exciting to see some of them in the current run of the lhc .",
    "so far we have exploited scenarios in which the lightest higgs boson is the sm - like . in such cases",
    "the mixing with new states lowers the tree - level @xmath143 compared to the mssm value , calling for even larger loop corrections to meet the measured value .",
    "however , one can contemplate an alternative scenario in which the lightest higgs boson is mostly singlet , and the next one is the sm - like .",
    "in such a case the second - lightest higgs state gets pushed up via mixing already at tree - level , thereby reducing the required loop corrections @xcite .",
