    "for more than a decade two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermion systems have been a subject of great interest .",
    "one important motivation has been the non - fermi - liquid behavior observed in high-@xmath2 superconductors above @xmath2.@xcite in this context the existence and stability of the fermi liquid ( fl ) in @xmath3 has been extensively investigated within various modern approaches.@xcite it seems fair to say that no compelling theoretical evidence has been found for non - fermi - liquid behavior in systems with short ranged interactions and in the absence of coupling to gauge fields .",
    "the fl is stable , provided that standard conditions@xcite are satisfied .    given this a natural question arises : suppose 2d fermions are in the fl phase in the sense of the landau s fermi liquid theory ( flt).@xcite we understand `` zero order '' fl quantities as those defined in the limit of zero temperature and zero momentum - energy transfers . then what is the low - energy behavior of such quantities ?",
    "in this paper we study the leading temperature corrections to the zero - order behavior of the the components of the landau function and the scattering vertex , the quasiparticle s effective mass , and the uniform response functions ( compressibility , spin susceptibility ) . in renormalization group ( rg )",
    "language we are studying the corrections coming from the leading irrelevant terms.@xcite    interest in the issue grown in recent years also because these leading corrections provide the `` bare '' temperature dependence of the parameters in theories describing quantum critical phenomena in metals.@xcite in particular , puzzling data in several materials @xcite led to explanations based on an unusual underlying temperature , momentum or frequency dependence of electronic susceptibilities.@xcite    the leading temperature corrections to the parameters of a _",
    "stable _ fl been studied for many years .",
    "rather surprisingly , the issue remains a subject of controversy .",
    "for example , it was found@xcite that the leading temperature correction to the specific heat coefficient @xmath4 was @xmath5 in d=3 spatial dimensions and @xmath6 in d=2.@xcite",
    ". recently these results were also rederived by multidimensional bosonization ( see , e.g. , ref .  [ ] ) . whether the spin and charge susceptibilities display similarly anomalous ( i.e. , non-@xmath7 ) temperature dependence is the subject of a lengthy controversy in the literature :",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] , discussion and references therein . for a most recent reassesment of such results see ref .  [ ] . the prevailing conclusion was that of carneiro and pethick@xcite who found no leading @xmath8 correction to the spin susceptibility of the 3d fl .",
    "their analysis implies that terms @xmath9 are absent in 2d .    the heuristic argument which runs commonly through the literature to account _",
    "a posteriori _ for the absence of anomalous terms ( in @xmath6 or in @xmath10 ) in response functions is that although these terms are known to occur in the individual self - energy and vertex diagrams , they cancel in final results for symmetry reasons mathematically expressed via ward identities . as we now discuss , this argument is misleading .",
    "although exact symmetries of a model ( e.g. , global gauge and/or rotational invariance ) result in relationships between the self - energy and the vertex through the ward identities ( cf .",
    "[ wisec ] below ) , these are usually not enough to close the system of equations and demonstrate explicitly the cancellation of the self - energy and vertex corrections .",
    "additional symmetries like , e.g. , the chiral symmetry of the 1d tomonaga - luttinger model , are needed in order to do it.@xcite in @xmath11 analogous extra _ asymptotic _",
    "symmetries first noted by haldane@xcite occur in the fermionic wilsonian _ low - energy effective action _ under some model s restrictions . in the recent series of papers by metzner , castellani and di castro ( reviewed in ref .",
    "[ ] ) the relationship between the extra asymptotic symmetry of the effective action and the rpa ( flt ) results for the response functions was clearly established .",
    "they also clarified a close connection between this approach and multidimensional bosonization.@xcite the additional ward identities are properties of a model in which all processes involving momentum transfers greater than a cutoff @xmath12 are discarded .",
    "these restrictions appear naturally in the wilsonian low - energy effective action with the uv cutoff ( [ lamea ] ) obtained from an rg approach such as that of shankar,@xcite in which interacting fermions are treated by progressive elimination of modes towards the fermi surface . only asymptotically ( i.e. , in the limit @xmath13 , @xmath0 ) this forward - scattering action possesses extra symmetries @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 for rotationally invariant case).@xcite ( it is assumed that the initial _ microscopic _ action ( hamiltonian ) has only ordinary @xmath16 [ and @xmath17 symmetry . ) however , these extra identities do not constrain possible @xmath6- or @xmath10- terms in physical quantities , coming from irrelevant terms . even in 1d ,",
    "e.g. , the @xmath18-breaking marginally irrelevant term coming from backscattering results in @xmath19-leading correction to the uniform spin susceptibility of the luttinger liquid.@xcite in higher dimensions there are always [ even in the limit ( [ lamea ] ) ] special configurations of momenta near the fermi surface which give rise to irrelevant terms in the effective action which strongly interfere with the forward scattering channel@xcite and invalidate asymptotic symmetries . in the framework of the low - energy effective action approach",
    "there is also another potential source of temperature corrections , i.e. , the possibility of @xmath6-dependence of the wilsonian action s vertices ( couplings ) developing on the previous stages of modes elimination before one reaches the effective action scale ( [ lamea ] ) .",
    "apparently , this question has not been carefully studied .",
    "we note that in the most of existing literature studying the leading fl corrections it is assumed that the crucial coupling is between quasiparticles and long - wavelength collective modes , i.e. , only small momentum scales are taken into account .",
    "however the possibility of `` @xmath20 singularities '' , i.e. , anomalous temperature terms coming from processes involving large ( @xmath21 ) momentum transfers , has been pointed out by misawa for 3d fl already in early 70s.@xcite apparently due to the lack of experimental evidence of a @xmath8 term in the susceptibility of a generic 3d fl and also because misawa s results rely on the analysis of selected diagrams [ cf . previous paragraph ] , they were widely disregarded in favor of those of carneiro and pethick",
    ". in the context of semiconductor physics stern was the first to note@xcite that in a 2d electron gas the electron scattering rate was proportional to @xmath6 due to @xmath20 effects .",
    "the consequences of the @xmath20 effects for the leading @xmath6-dependence of 2d fl quantities have not been considered in the literature until recently .",
    "the issue of the leading correction to flt has recently been revived by several papers .",
    "belitz , kirkpatrick and vojta@xcite presented perturbative calculations , mode - coupling arguments and power counting estimates which showed that the leading @xmath10 dependence of the spin susceptibility ( but not the charge susceptibility ) was @xmath22 in 2d ( @xmath23 in 3d ) .",
    "they did not find the analogous @xmath6-correction explicitly , but concluded that one should generally expect a linear @xmath6-term in the 2d fl susceptibility ( @xmath24 in 3d ) .",
    "this dependence has important implications for the theory of the quantum critical metallic ferromagnet.@xcite    snchal and one of us@xcite predicted the occurence of the linear @xmath6-corrections to the fl vertices from one - loop rg calculations based on a 2d effective action .",
    "those rg calculations of the irrelevant corrections rely more on the low - energy effective action s phase space constrains in their way to sort out the effective interactions and the scales involved , rather than on doing it according to the strength of the latter , as a perturbation theory does .",
    "that makes desirable to easily obtain a perturbative signal of the rg predictions .",
    "also , an analogous rg calculation of other fl quantities was not done .",
    "hirashima and takahashi@xcite performed numerical analyses of perturbative expressions which appeared to confirm the prediction of belitz _",
    "et al_@xcite for 2d susceptibility . however due to numerical difficulties in handling divergences in some terms",
    "they were unable even to determine the sign of the coefficient in the leading @xmath10-term .",
    "also contrary to belitz _",
    "et al _ who focused on the long - wavelength contributions , the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] emphasized the crucial role of @xmath20 contributions in their findings .",
    "following this misawa conjectured a phenomenological form for the free energy@xcite which results in the linear @xmath6-term in the 2d spin susceptibility and in the coefficient @xmath25 , and agrees well with the numerical calculations in lowest order.@xcite    this previous work has left a number of important questions unresolved , including analytic treatment of anomalous terms ( important for verifying cancellations between different contributions ) , the relationship to flt and to ward identities , and the connection to the extensive literature from the 1960 - 70s . to elucidate the issues in the most transparent way",
    ", we apply the perturbation theory for 2d contact - interacting spin-@xmath26 fermions , starting from a _ microscopic _ action .",
    "although the landau flt is not a perturbative theory , for sufficiently weak interactions ( assuming the interaction being repulsive and we are above the kohn - luttinger temperature ) one should be able to find the parameters of the fl in terms of the coupling series .",
    "we present what is apparently the first analytic calculation of the leading @xmath6-dependence of the effective mass , landau parameters and response functions of a 2d electron gas , to second order in the interaction strength , _ including all channels and all momentum processes ( scales)_. we take into account the ward identities explicitly . as we show in this paper , the processes involving large ( @xmath27 ) momentum transfers are crucial to the anomalous temperature dependence of fl quantities .",

    "we define the two - particle green s function as : @xmath58 the 1pi vertex @xmath59 is related to @xmath60 as @xmath61 where due to the symmetries of the model we can write the one - particle green s function as @xmath62 perturbatively , the vertex is constructed by considering only connected one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams with amputated external legs . in lowest order @xmath63 . to shorten notations we use the hat meaning that it is an operator in the spin space , and it also comprises two components . along with the representation ( [ pots ] ) with the components ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) for the vertex , which explicitly shows its antisymmetry",

    "we will frequently use the property of the components @xmath74 and @xmath75 which is a consequence of the vertex s antisymmetry @xmath76 for the calculation of physical quantities of the fl we need @xmath77 at @xmath78 .",
    "as is well known@xcite the limit @xmath79 is not unique , since the vertex is non - analytic function at @xmath80 .",

    "note that taken separately , each contribution of the zs- or bcs bubble has a leading linear temperature - dependent term in the first two fourier components of the vertices [ cf .",
    "eqs.([chi0app],[chi1app ] ) and eqs.([c0f],[c1f ] ) , resp . ] .",
    "however , a cancellation of such terms coming from two graphs occurs in the `` charge sector '' ( i.e. , in @xmath136 , @xmath125 components ) , while the linear t - terms survive in the `` spin sector '' ( @xmath137 , @xmath126 components ) .    to understand where the temperature dependence of the vertices comes from ,",

    "so the temperature dependence of the zs ( exchange ) contribution to the fourier components of the vertices comes from integrating of the function @xmath141 around the `` effective transfer '' @xmath140 in the zs graph , i.e. , when incoming momenta @xmath142 , while @xmath143 .",

    "this source of temperature dependence was not considered by pethick and carneiro , for example . in the same vein",

    ".    let us elaborate on the last point a bit more .",
    "first notice that in the perturbative approximation ( [ gammapertexp ] ) for the vertex in the model with a constant couplings @xmath146 ( bare vertex ) , all the three one - loop terms have the same factor @xmath147 in front of the bubble contributions @xmath148 . had",
    "these coupling factors been different for each of the three graph , the cancellation of the temperature corrections would not have happened .",
    "on the other hand , even the simplest approximation ( [ gammapertexp ] ) shows that fermionic interactions drive any bare _ coupling constant _ towards a _ coupling function _ of , generally speaking , three momenta [ cf .",
    "eq.([gammatr ] ) ] .",
    "more advanced calculations of the fl parameters , like , e.g. , rg , would reproduce such development of the momentum dependence in couplings in the regime of effective action ( [ lamea ] ) .",
    "this would prevent the cancellations between different terms , e.g. , between the one - loop zs and bcs contributions , which we have obtained in the simple perturbational framework.@xcite    another artifact of the naive perturbative calculation of the vertex is its ultraviolet divergence coming from the bcs bubble .",
    "the @xmath149-term makes our perturbation theory applicable only if the interaction is small enough that the arbitrary , generally speaking , ultaviolet cutoff @xmath150 can be chosen to satisfy @xmath151 . however , we should not worry too much about this issue , since more sophisticated calculations based , e.g. , on summations of the diagrammatic series or an rg would result in an effective screening of the repulsive interaction in the bcs channel .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "( although providing the possibility of the _ infrared _ instability ( divergence ) at exponentially low temperatures ( much lower than , say , we are working at ) through the kohn - luttinger mechanism.@xcite )    the linear dependence of the leading temperature corrections to the fl parameters seems not to be sensitive to the actual form of the one - particle spectrum .",
    "the same dependence ( apart from model - sensitive prefactors ) was obtained in the previous rg analysis of the _ effective action _ model for 2d spinless fermions with a linearized spectrum.@xcite in that study the integration of the `` effective '' transfer in the exchange ( zs ) graph contribution to the rg flow was also resulting in the linear @xmath6-term in the vertex corrections . according to ref .",
