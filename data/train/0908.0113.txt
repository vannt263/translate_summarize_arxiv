    "many observations indicate the existence of large - scale magnetic fields associated with galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "these magnetic fields typically have strengths of a few @xmath7gauss and large coherence lengths , i.e. , a few kpc for galaxies and a few tens of kpc for galaxy clusters  @xcite . however , the origin of such magnetic fields is not understood clearly , while many generation processes have been proposed .",
    "the generally accepted idea is an astrophysical dynamo scenario .",
    "very tiny seed magnetic fields are generated in stars and supernova explosions by astrophysical processes such as biermann battery , and the produced seed magnetic fields are amplified by the dynamo process in astrophysical objects .",
    "finally these magnetic fields are spread into the inter - galactic medium by supernova winds or active galactic nuclei jets  @xcite . however , there are two major problems remaining in this scenario .",
    "the first problem is the efficiency of the dynamo process in the expanding universe .",
    "recent observations suggest the existence of @xmath8gauss magnetic fields in high redshift galaxies  @xcite",
    ". these galaxies may be dynamically too young to explain the existence of such magnetic fields by the dynamo process .",
    "the second problem concerns large coherence lengths .",
    "it is particularly difficult to explain observed magnetic fields with very large coherent scales in galaxy clusters  @xcite .    aside from this astrophysical scenario , there are alternative scenarios in which magnetic fields are generated in the early universe , e.g. , inflation epoch or cosmological phase transitions such as qcd or electroweak . in these scenarios , there is the potential to obtain nano gauss primordial magnetic fields .",
    "such strength is sufficient to explain @xmath8gauss magnetic fields observed at present without the dynamo process because the adiabatic compression due to the structure formation can easily amplify primordial magnetic fields by a factor of @xmath9 .",
    "however , if the seed magnetic fields generated in the early universe are too weak , the dynamo process is required even in these scenarios while the coherence length could be very large , unlike the astrophysical processes . for a detailed review ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "if primordial magnetic fields existed in the early universe , these fields left traces of their existences in various cosmological phenomena , e.g. , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , temperature anisotropies and polarization of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , or large scale structure formations . from these traces",
    ", we can set observational constraints on primordial magnetic fields .",
    "these constraints give us clues to the origin of large scale magnetic fields , as well as when and how primordial magnetic fields were generated , because the strength and the coherence length of primordial magnetic fields depend on the generation process .",
    "let us first summarize bbn constraint .",
    "since the primordial magnetic fields enhanced the cosmological expansion rate through the contribution of the energy density of primordial magnetic fields to the total energy density of the universe , the existence of primordial magnetic fields with sufficient strength may modify the abundance of light elements .",
    "the constraint on the magnetic field strength from bbn is @xmath10gauss where @xmath11 is the total comoving magnetic field strength  @xcite .",
    "primordial magnetic fields produce cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "particularly , before recombination , primordial magnetic fields induce the vorticity of a baryon fluid by the lorentz force .",
    "the induced vorticity generates cmb temperature anisotropies through the doppler effect @xcite . from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )",
    "data , the constraint on the primordial magnetic fields with @xmath12mpc@xmath13mpc is @xmath14gauss @xcite .",
    "moreover , this vorticity generates cmb b - mode ( parity odd ) polarization as well as e - mode ( parity even ) polarization  @xcite . in particular , b - modes are less contaminated by other sources than e - modes so that we expect to obtain stringent limits on the primordial magnetic fields by future observations of cmb b - modes .",
    "after recombination , there are two main effects of primordial magnetic fields on the universe .",
    "one is the modification of the thermal evolution of baryons  @xcite . through the dissipation of primordial magnetic fields , primordial magnetic fields increase the baryon temperature after thermal decoupling of baryons from cmb .",
    "this dissipation is caused by the ambipolar diffusion and the direct cascade decay of small scale magnetic fields .",
    "the other effect is the generation of density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the motion of ionized baryons induced by magnetic fields produces additional density fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations induce density fluctuations of neutral baryons and dark matter through the gravitational force .",
    "the magnetic tension and pressure are more effective on small scales where the entanglements of magnetic fields are larger .",
    "therefore , if primordial magnetic fields existed , it is expected that there is additional power in the density power spectrum , on small scales , which induces the early structure formation .",
    "these effects , modification of baryon thermal history and generation of additional density fluctuations , impact the reionization process .",
    "therefore , it is possible to set constraints on primordial magnetic fields from the measurement of the optical depth @xcite and the observation of 21 cm lines @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the effect of primordial magnetic fields on the sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) angular power spectrum .",
    "the s - z effect occurs when cmb photons passing galaxy clusters are scattered by hot electron gas in galaxy clusters @xcite . due to the scattering",
    ", the cmb spectrum suffers distortion from the blackbody shape .",
    "the amount of distortion depends on the temperature and the number density of hot electron gas . in the low frequency limit ,",
    "i.e. , the rayleigh - jeans part , this distortion causes decrease in temperature , which is observed as the temperature anisotropies in the cmb sky .",
    "since the distribution of hot electron gas follows that of dark matter halos , the s - z angular power spectrum traces the dark matter halo distribution which could be enhanced by primordial magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , it is known that the s - z effect is an ideal probe for the high redshift clusters / dark halos because the strength of the s - z signal does not depend on redshift of the object , which is not the case for x - ray brightness temperature or the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "since the primordial magnetic fields induce structure formation in the early epoch , we can conclude that the s - z power spectrum can be used as a unique probe for the primordial mangetic fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the density fluctuations due to primordial magnetic fields . in sec .",
    "iii , we summarize the calculation of the angular power spectrum of the s - z effect . in sec .",

    "in this section , we calculate the density fluctuations produced by primordial magnetic fields .",
    "let us make some assumptions about primordial magnetic fields at first .",
    "since the length scales which we are interested in are large , the back - reaction of the fluid velocity is small .",

    "our interest is to constrain the magnetic field strength on a certain scale in the real space .",

    "<S> this additional s - z effect due to primordial magnetic fields amplifies the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave temperature anisotropies on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> this amplification depends on the comoving amplitude and the power law index of the primordial magnetic fields spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> comparing with the small scale cmb observations , we obtained the constraints on the primordial magnetic fields , i.e. , @xmath0 ngauss for @xmath1 or @xmath2 ngauss for @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the comoving amplitude of magnetic fields at @xmath5 mpc and @xmath6 is the power law index . </S>",
    "<S> future s - z measurements have the potential to give constraints tighter than those from temperature anisotropies and polarization of cosmic microwave background induced by the magnetic fields at the recombination epoch .    </S>",
