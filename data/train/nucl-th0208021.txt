    "an important aspect of strong - interaction physics that is only now being explored is the dependence of nuclei and nuclear reactions on the fundamental parameters of nature , such as @xmath2 and the quark masses , @xmath3 . with recent developments in the effective field theory ( eft ) description of multi - nucleon systems fundamental questions about nuclear physics",
    "can be addressed .",
    "while the @xmath3-dependence of the nuclear force is unrelated to present day observables , it is a fundamental aspect of nuclear physics , and in some sense serves as a benchmark for the development of a perturbative theory of nuclear forces . having this behavior under control will be essential to any bridge between lattice qcd simulations and nuclear physics in the near future . in work by bedaque , van kolck and the authors  @xcite ( which we will refer to as bbsvk ) , a new power - counting scheme , bbsvk - counting , was introduced , and with a partial next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation in this new counting scheme , an attempt was made to determine the behavior of the two - nucleon force as the @xmath3 were increased or decreased from their physical values .",
    "calculations of the @xmath3-dependence of scattering in the @xmath0-channel and @xmath4 coupled - channels as well as a discussion of the deuteron binding energy were presented . in a subsequent paper",
    "@xcite we performed the first complete nlo calculation in bbsvk - counting of the @xmath3-dependence of the two - nucleon systems .",
    "previous estimates of such @xmath3-dependences  @xcite that served as input to place bounds on physics beyond the standard model via the time - variation of fundamental parameters on cosmological time scales were found to be incomplete .    in this work , which should be considered a sequel to ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigate the @xmath3-dependence of the two - nucleon systems , incorporating the present uncertainties in strong interaction parameters  . in some instances , parameters that play a central role in the @xmath3-dependence , such as the leading @xmath3-dependent four - nucleon interaction ,",
    "are not constrained experimentally . in such cases ,",
    "we use naive - dimensional - analysis ( nda ) to provide a `` reasonable range '' for their values . of particular interest to us",
    "is the behavior of the two - nucleon sector in the chiral limit .",
    "we find it likely that there is no di - nucleon bound state in the @xmath0-channel ; i.e. the scattering length remains negative . on the other hand",
    ", we can not determine if there is a bound - state in the @xmath4 coupled channels in the chiral limit .",
    "the strong interaction parameters are sufficiently uncertain at present to preclude a definitive answer to this fundamental question .",
    "in the @xmath0-channel , pions give a subleading contribution to the scattering amplitude and are included in perturbation theory . in this channel ,",
    "bbsvk - counting is equivalent to kaplan - savage - wise ( ksw ) power - counting  @xcite .",
    "thus , analytic expressions for the scattering amplitude , and hence the scattering length , as a function of @xmath3 and momentum , @xmath5 , are straightforwardly found . from the nlo amplitude",
    "@xcite it is easy to construct @xmath6 , which has a well - behaved power - series expansion for @xmath7 , and thus a linear combination of @xmath8 ( the coefficient of the @xmath3- and @xmath5-independent four - nucleon operator ) and @xmath9 ( the coefficient of the @xmath5-independent and leading @xmath3-dependent four - nucleon operators ) can be determined in terms of the scattering length @xmath10 at the physical value of the pion mass .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 ( the coefficient of the @xmath3-independent , leading @xmath12-dependent four - nucleon operator ) can be determined in terms of the effective range , @xmath13 .",
    "once these parameters are fixed , the scattering length , effective range and phase - shift can be determined as a function of @xmath3 at nlo in the ksw expansion .",
    "the scattering length is , in the isospin limit , @xmath14   -\\frac{m_n m_\\pi^2}{4\\pi}(\\gamma -\\mu ) ^2 \\ d_2(\\mu ) \\ \\ , \\label{eq : scattlength}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the pds renormalization scale  @xcite .",
    "we have used the leading order ( lo ) relation between the pion mass , @xmath17 , and the light - quark masses , @xmath3 .",
    "as pions are treated in perturbation theory , the @xmath3-dependence arising from the chiral expansions of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is formally higher order in ksw - counting and is neglected .",
    "the physical values of these parameters , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are used for the analysis in this channel .    at present",
    ", the coefficient @xmath9 has not been experimentally separated from the coefficient @xmath8 in this channel , or in the @xmath4 coupled - channels .",
    "this is because both parameters are coefficients of momentum - independent operators with the only difference between the operators arising from their couplings to pions ; the @xmath8 operator does not give rise to interactions between two - nucleons and multiple pions , while the @xmath9 operator does . in order to determine the range of values of @xmath9 consistent with nda , we use the expression for the scattering length in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scattlength ] ) at the physical value of the pion mass and find values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 that satisfy the constraint @xmath26 where the constant @xmath27 is chosen to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 for demonstrative purposes .",
    "0.15 in    .2 in    it is worthwhile discussing why these values are chosen .",
    "very roughly , @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the scale at which the eft description breaks down .",
    "naively , the ksw perturbative - pion expansion breaks down at a scale @xmath32 .",
    "this would then give @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , one might expect that a better estimate of the cutoff scale is given by the mass of the fictitious scalar , @xmath34 , that provides intermediate - range attraction in many potential models .",
    "taking @xmath35 one then arrives at @xmath36 .",
    "of course this last argument is somewhat specious ; it is really at @xmath37 that @xmath34 should be treated as a dynamical object .",
    "this discussion underscores the difficulty in providing an _ a priori _ estimate of a parameter in an eft .",
    "hence , given the complete lack of experimental information on @xmath9 , and the absence of any reliable method to estimate its value , we take @xmath27 to be @xmath28 and @xmath29 to provide an estimate of the uncertainty arising from @xmath9 . we stress that even larger values of @xmath27 , such as @xmath38 , are not excluded experimentally .",
    "of course larger values of @xmath27 lead to a smaller radius of convergence of the eft . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1s0mq ] we show the scattering length in the @xmath0-channel as a function of @xmath3 , where we have randomly sampled values of @xmath17 and @xmath27 within the allowed ranges . from the standpoint of nda , it is likely that the di - neutron is unbound in the chiral limit for any values of @xmath3 less than the physical values .",
    "of course , the same will be true for the other di - nucleon states in the @xmath0-channel by isospin symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath3 larger than their physical values , we see that there are both bound and unbound di - neutrons for values of the strong - interaction parameters consistent with nda .",
    "this observation reinforces our previous analysis  @xcite .    for the strong - interaction parameter sets where the scattering length remains unnaturally large in the chiral limit , it is likely that higher - order contributions to the scattering amplitude will significantly disturb the system .",
    "thus , for such situations , higher - order contributions may lead to a bound state where one does not exist at nlo .",
    "the deuteron resides in the @xmath4 coupled - channels when the @xmath3 assume their physical values . in our previous work",
    "@xcite we found that insufficient is presently known about the strong - interaction couplings in the two - nucleon sector to determine if the deuteron is bound or unbound for small values of @xmath3 , including the chiral limit , or for @xmath3 larger than their physical values . in this section",
    "we make these findings more explicit and determine the regions allowed by data , and by nda in the absence of data , for the @xmath1 scattering length and deuteron binding energy , @xmath39 , as a function of @xmath3 , at nlo in bbsvk - counting .",
    "the details of the calculation of scattering lengths , phase shifts and bound state energies in the @xmath4 coupled channels can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we do not repeat the details here . however , a brief description of the procedure , and of the sources of uncertainty is in order . in this channel , unlike the @xmath0-channel , the chiral limit of one - pion - exchange ( ope ) is included at lo in bbsvk - counting .",
    "this then allows for the re - summation of the large tensor - force that persists in the chiral limit , and is responsible for the non - convergence of ksw - counting in this channel  @xcite .",
    "deviations from the chiral limit are included in perturbation theory , as are higher - dimension operators and multiple pion exchanges  @xcite . in the @xmath4 coupled - channels",
    ", ope generates both central and tensor potentials , @xmath40 where @xmath41 . the low - energy constant ( lec ) @xmath42 has been determined through various fitting procedures  @xcite to be @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45  @xcite and @xmath46  @xcite at third - order in the chiral expansion .",
    "while we are unable to establish a definition of the uncertainties associated with each of these determinations , we assume that they represent @xmath47 errors arising from a parabolic error analysis of the minuit package , as partially described in ref .",
    "further , in the absence of an error correlation matrix , we will treat the uncertainties in the values of lecs as uncorrelated ; this constitutes a weakness in our propagation of errors .",
    "thus , we sample values of @xmath42 over the range @xmath48 , corresponding to the @xmath47 limits of the first three determinations above   @xcite is significantly larger than the other determinations and we discard it . ] , and as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this range is probably an _ underestimate _ of the true uncertainty in @xmath42 .",

    "we use @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : snparams ] ) that is most uncertain and gives rise to a substantial uncertainty in our calculations in the two - nucleon sector is @xmath57 .",
    "a complete analysis by fettes  @xcite of the @xmath58 sector provides three different determinations of @xmath57 : @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus we sample this parameter over the range @xmath62 , again corresponding to the @xmath47 limits of the three determinations . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we retained only the chiral logarithm contribution to @xmath18 , and evaluated its argument at the scale @xmath63 , which corresponds to choosing @xmath64 .",
    "note that while this value is outside the @xmath47 range of @xmath57 , it is not excluded by data . as @xmath52 makes only a small contribution to the ope potential , its uncertainty has negligible impact and we hold @xmath52 fixed to its central value in what follows .    at nlo in bbsvk - counting",
    "there is a contribution from the chiral limit of two - pion exchange ( tpe ) and from an insertion of the @xmath11 and @xmath9 operators .",
    "the tpe potential in coordinate space has been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in the chiral limit becomes @xmath65    in order to regulate the singular potentials that occur at lo and nlo we use a spatial square - well of radius @xmath66  @xcite , where the potential outside the square well is @xmath67 where @xmath68 the potential inside the square well is @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are constant potentials corresponding to the renormalized local operators with coefficients @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 in the @xmath4 coupled - channels , respectively  , as @xmath73 , as required in the renormalized theory .",
    "] , and again we have used the lo relation between the pion mass and @xmath3 . as discussed in bbsvk",

    "( [ eq : potin ] ) , e.g. @xmath74 and similarly for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to recall that there is implicit @xmath3-dependence in this potential due to @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 , in addition to the explicit dependence from @xmath77 , and from ope . defining the wavefunction @xmath78 to be @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the s - wave wavefunction and @xmath81 is the d - wave wavefunction , the regulated schrdinger equation is @xmath82 \\psi ( r ) & = & 0 \\ \\ .",

    "@xcite .",
    "a few words are in order concerning the power - counting .",
    "bbsvk - counting concerns itself with a consistent removal of cutoff effects , order - by - order in the eft expansion  @xcite .",
    "the ope potential is special in that only the chiral limit piece requires renormalization .",
    "this is because the @xmath83 contribution in the pion mass expansion vanishes and all other terms in the expansion are regular at the origin .",
    "the chiral expansion of ope has been shown to converge , albeit slowly , in ref .",
    "we could , of course , arrange the power counting so as to keep as many orders in the ope perturbative chiral expansion as necessary in order to match to the results shown in our paper , which treats the chiral expansion of ope to all orders ; however , this would be rather pointless , since treating the potential to all orders in the chiral expansion is perfectly innocuous from the perspective of renormalization , and in such cases it is perfectly legitimate to treat perturbative physics nonperturbatively .",
    "on the other hand , the tpe potential has a significantly more divergent chiral expansion as there are singular - attractive @xmath84 and @xmath85 contributions .",
    "it is likely that treating tpe to all orders while keeping only the counterterms at nlo in weinberg counting does not remove all cutoff artifacts ( scaling as logarithms or inverse powers of the coordinate - space cutoff ) .",
    "we have confirmed this strong cutoff dependence of the full tpe numerically ; this is , in fact , strong motivation for using bbsvk counting .",

    "[ fig : bdmq ] we show the deuteron binding energy as a function of the pion mass for the full range of @xmath42 and @xmath57 and taking @xmath91 .",
    "perhaps it is worth interpreting the binding energy curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : bdmq ] using the scattering length curves of fig .  [ fig:3s1mqa ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqb ] .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqa ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqb ] that the scattering length can be negative for @xmath92 , indicating an unbound deuteron .",
    "naively one would expect the scattering length to go through infinity to unbind the deuteron ; this would correspond to the deuteron binding energy going through zero .",
    "however , in this work we find that the deuteron becomes unbound in the approach to the chiral limit by becoming increasingly deeply bound and thus leaving the range of applicability of the eft .    from these figures we conclude that the present uncertainty in strong - interaction parameters precludes a definitive statement being made concerning the binding or non - binding of the deuteron in the chiral limit .",
    "this is consistent with our previous studies  @xcite .",
    "it is a combination of uncertainties in the @xmath58 sector and the lack of any information in the two - nucleon sector regarding @xmath9 that conspire to prevent a definitive conclusion .",
    "it is clear that progress must be made on both issues before the chiral limit of the @xmath4 coupled channels can be predicted . to demonstrate the impact of @xmath57 , in fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqc ] we show the scattering length in the @xmath1 channel for @xmath93 , a value that is not excluded by data .",
    "clearly the sensitivity of the two - nucleon system to this parameter is rather dramatic . for this parameter",
    "set we see the deuteron unbinding by the scattering length going through both infinity and zero .",
    "impressive progress has been made in extrapolating lattice observables in the single - nucleon and meson sectors from lattice quark masses to the physical quark masses .",
    "in addition to being important in its own right , this work is essential for interpretation of lattice qcd results in nuclei . extrapolations of some quenched lattice qcd observables at large quark masses ( @xmath94 ) to physical values of the quark masses are seen to be in good agreement with experimental values  @xcite .",
    "future partially - quenched or unquenched simulations are required at smaller quark masses in order to have confidence in first principles calculations . as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a quenched lattice calculation of the scattering lengths in both the @xmath0 and @xmath1-channels exists  @xcite , but for pion masses greater than @xmath95 . while it would be tempting to extrapolate our results to these pion masses it is likely that the eft will have broken down at much smaller pion masses . moreover , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the long - distance part of the two - nucleon force is modified in quenched and partially - quenched qcd ; for instance , long - distance yukawa behavior is modified to pure exponential fall - off .",
    "this poses yet another challenge to bridging the gap between nuclear physics and lattice qcd  @xcite .",
    "while this paper was in preparation , an analysis by epelbaum , gl \" ockle and meiner ( egm ) has become available  @xcite which also extends earlier work on this subject  @xcite .",
    "egm consider the @xmath3-dependence of nuclear forces using their formulation of weinberg s power - counting  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with our coordinate - space derivation , this work involves a numerical solution to the lippmann - schwinger equation with a potential generated order - by - order in the chiral expansion with a power - counting derived for the meson and single nucleon sectors .",
    "their work is in qualitative agreement with the results of our previous papers  @xcite and with the results we have presented here . despite the differences in regularization method and the subtly different power - counting schemes , it not surprising to see that the two efts yield results that appear to be perturbatively close . in the @xmath0-channel",
    ", it is encouraging to see that the results of the numerical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite agree with our analytic results obtained from the perturbative - pion expansion . however , there are quite significant differences in the uncertainties associated with the extrapolation of the observables away from the physical value of the pion mass , particularly in the @xmath4 coupled channels .",
    "these discrepancies arise from a different treatment of uncertainties associated with the strong - interaction parameters @xmath57 , @xmath42 and @xmath9 .",
    "it appears that egm  @xcite have chosen a range of values of @xmath9 consistent with @xmath96 , which we consider to be overly optimistic   and @xmath97 .",
    "however , there are four operators , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , that can be constructed with one insertion of @xmath3  @xcite . with four operators present",
    ", we find that their method saturates the range over which nlo is a subleading correction , and thus reproduces the nda estimates that we have used . ] .",
    "egm argue that , for the range of cutoffs they use to define their eft , all experimentally determined low - energy constants in the two - nucleon sector fall within the `` nda '' estimates that they have created .",
    "unfortunately , at present there is no way to test the reliability of such estimates for @xmath3-dependent operators .",
    "moreover , egm have chosen not to propagate the known and relatively large errors associated with the extraction of @xmath57  @xcite from the single nucleon sector . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1mqz ] we show the @xmath1 scattering length as a function of the pion mass for the parameter ranges used by egm . with their parameters",
    "we reproduce their results , up to terms higher order in both eft descriptions .",
    "for instance , we recover their result of @xmath100 in the chiral limit . therefore , while we find the claims of ref .",
    "@xcite to be quite spectacular , e.g. a deuteron binding energy of @xmath101 in the chiral limit , it would appear that their error analysis is incomplete , and when a complete error analysis is performed , their claims are likely to be greatly diminished  : @xmath102 .",
    "while their results are becoming more consistent with our analysis , we believe that egm continue to underestimate the errors in the strong interaction parameters .",

    "understanding how nuclei and nuclear interactions depend upon the light - quark masses is a fundamental aspect of strong - interaction physics .",
    "we have been able to explore the @xmath3-dependence of two - nucleon systems using a recently - developed effective field theory and naive dimensional analysis . in the @xmath0-channel",
