    "following the proposal of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which connects string theory on asymptotically anti - de sitter space to certain conformal field theories on its boundary , black holes in ads space have received renewed attention . in particular , the hawking - page phase transition from hot anti - de sitter ( ads ) to schwarzschild - ads @xcite has been shown by witten @xcite to correspond to a phase transition from the confining phase to the deconfining phase in the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath1 yang - mills on the boundary of the ads space .",
    "he argued that the strength of the conjecture is demonstrated by the existence of a holographic duality even at non - zero temperature where supersymmetry and conformal invariance are broken .    in the euclidean picture the boundary at which the conformal field theory is defined",
    "is an @xmath2 which is a codimension - one slice of the euclideanised ads and schwarzschild - ads at radial infinity .",
    "however , one can consider a more general , and non - trivial , boundary by taking the @xmath2 at a finite radial distance so that the @xmath3 is of finite volume ( and assuming , initially , that the @xmath4-fibre has finite radius as well ) .",
    "infinite volume for either or both of @xmath4 and @xmath3 occur as limits . from the holographic point of view , such a finite boundary is relevant for understanding the stronger form of holography .",
    "indeed a large literature exists where this has been considered in the context of the randall - saundrum type scenarios @xcite and various related topics ( see @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "a primary objective in such studies as in the infinite boundary limit mentioned above , is to understand the relationship between the geometries of the possible regular bulk solutions and the geometry of the given boundary .",
    "such study falls under the purview of the classical dirichlet boundary - value problem in riemannian geometry ( see below ) .",
    "once the relationship between various bulk geometries and the boundary geometry are known , either qualitatively or quantitatively , one can explore the semi - classical implications using euclidean path integral formulation .",
    "in particular , if the geometries of the bulk are known as functions of the boundary variables , one can find the classical action and other quantities of interest purely in terms of boundary data . in the example above , in which the boundary is at infinity , this can be done precisely for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "the meaningful boundary data then is the ratio of the two radii of the fibre and the base .",
    "however , when the boundary is brought at a finite distance this becomes rather non - trivial as we will see in this paper .    in the path integral formulation of euclidean quantum gravity finite @xmath2 boundaries first appeared in the study of black holes in a `` box '' .",
    "the radii @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the @xmath7-fibre and @xmath3-base ( with the standard metrics on them ) constitute the canonical boundary condition with the interpretation that the @xmath3 cavity of radius @xmath5 is immersed in an isothermal heat bath of temperature @xmath8 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that within a finite @xmath9 cavity apart from hot flat space , classically there are two or no black - hole solutions depending on whether the temperature of the heat bath is above or below a certain value base and is not the same as what we called the `` boundary '' in the euclideanised picture which is an @xmath2 . ] .",
    "this is true for any finite radius of the cavity .",
    "of the two solutions , the larger one has a positive specific heat and the smaller one a negative specific heat .",
    "hence , only the larger solution is locally thermodynamically stable .",
    "it is possible to find the masses of the two black holes as functions of the cavity radius and wall - temperature ( i.e. , in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the euclidean picture ) . for sufficiently high temperature",
    "the larger mass solution has a more negative action than hot flat space and hence a stable black hole can nucleate from hot flat space in a thermodynamically consistent manner within a cavity of arbitrary radius . in the infinite - volume limit of the cavity",
    "only the smaller - mass solution with the negative specific heat survives .",
    "therefore , only in a finite cavity is it possible to have a thermodynamically stable black hole solution for such boundary conditions .",
    "recently these results have been generalized and discussed for higher dimensions in @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a negative cosmological constant , stable schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 black holes are possible @xcite and one is not required to introduce an isothermal finite cavity , at least for obtaining a stable solution .",
    "this perhaps explains the comparative lack of attention in the literature to the finite cavity case for @xmath11 except the study made in @xcite where this has been studied for four dimensions .",
    "there it is shown that for such boundary condition , there are two / no schwarzschild - ads@xmath12 solutions and always a ads@xmath12 solution . assuming that the standard area - law of black - hole entropy holds for such boundary conditions , there it was shown that the larger and the smaller black hole have positive and negative specific heats respectively as in the @xmath13 case .",
    "as the cosmological constant introduces a scale , it is not possible to find the masses in terms of the boundary variables , which was possible in the flat - space case for four dimensions @xcite , except in the limit of infinite cavity . in this paper",
    "we will be extending this picture to higher dimensions by providing a complete semi - classical treatment . in the classical side of the picture",
    "we will discuss solutions of bulk geometries in terms of boundary data , i.e. , the two radii @xmath14 and will combine this with the semi - classical study to show that a phase transition occurs within the cavity for sufficiently high value of its wall - temperature . in the infinite cavity limit",
    "the analogue of the phase transition is the well - known hawking - page phase transition , in which case the phase transition is studied as functions of the hawking temperature ( or equivalently the horizon radius ) of the black holes instead of the boundary variables ( which is the only way to do this since the local temperature of any finite schwarzschild - ads redshifts to zero at infinity , unlike in the flat space case , see later ) .",
    "such a study has not been done before for @xmath15 for four or higher dimensions .",
    "the goal of this paper is therefore twofold : to study possible black hole solutions as functions of the boundary geometry and to compute their on - shell actions , and explore which solutions dominate and under what conditions on the boundary variables",
    ". we will be as rigorous as possible in our treatment and obtain explicit formulae and relate them to the well known @xmath13 results .",
    "interestingly , we find that a precise quantitative treatment is possible only in five dimensions .",
    "this is the most interesting because of its connection with the 4-d world within a holographic context .",
    "the results obtained herein can thus be extended in various directions and sets the ground for many future investigations .",
    "this paper is arranged in the following way . in section 2",
    "we discuss the euclidean ads@xmath10 and schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 metrics and set our conventions . in section 3",
    "we discuss the dirichlet problem and thermodynamics of the black - hole solutions after briefly discussing the @xmath13 case .",
    "phase transitions are studied in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we specialize to five dimensions and show how the above questions can be addressed precisely .",
    "we conclude with remarks on possible ramifications of the results for current topical issues .",
    "the euclidean ads@xmath10 and schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 metrics have the following forms : @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "both metrics satisfy the einstein equation with a cosmological constant @xmath19 .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 in eq.([shads1 ] ) gives the mass @xmath21 of the black hole @xcite",
    "@xmath22 for notational convenience we will set @xmath23 without any loss of generality and denote @xmath24 as @xmath25 and @xmath20 as @xmath26 in this scale . when there is no chance of confusion we will refer to @xmath26 as the `` mass '' of the black hole .",
    "the horizon of the schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 metric ( [ shads ] ) is the positive root of the equation @xmath27 and will be denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the horizon radius @xmath28 and the mass @xmath26 are in 1 - 1 correspondence : @xmath29 the singularity at the horizon can be removed if we give @xmath30 a periodicity of @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the surface gravity .",
    "the metric is then well - defined for @xmath33 which includes the horizon which is now the @xmath34-dimensional fixed point set of the killing vector @xmath35 and is a regular bolt of the metric ( which explains the use of subscript in @xmath36 ) .",
    "the periodicity @xmath37 gives the inverse of hawking temperature of the hole @xmath38 note that the ads@xmath10 metric is regular for @xmath39 .",
    "one therefore is not required to ascribe a certain periodicity to @xmath30 in order to achieve regularity . in other words , one can choose the periodicity of @xmath30 arbitrarily as in the case of flat space .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the problem that we address in this paper formally falls under the scope of the classical dirichlet problem in which one seeks one or more regular @xmath40-dimensional riemannian solutions @xmath41 of the einstein equations for a given @xmath42-boundary @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 possibly with the condition of regularity . in most physically interesting cases ,",
    "the dirichlet problem simplifies as only cohomogeneity - one metrics whose principal orbits share the topology and symmetry of the boundary are considered . in the presence of only a possible cosmological constant term ,",
    "this reduces the einstein equation to a set of ordinary differential equations to be solved subject to the boundary condition and regularity .",
    "however , in cases of high symmetry the general solution of this set and the manifolds over which they can be extended completely or partially may be known in advance .",
    "the dirichlet problem then simplifies to the problem of embedding @xmath46 in known manifolds  the `` infilling '' solutions then are the compact regular parts of the manifolds enclosed by @xmath46 .",
    "such solutions provide semi - classical approximations to the path integral and are the starting point of a quantum treatment . depending on the boundary data",
    "there can be zero , one or multiple infilling solutions of similar or different topologies even when one assumes a high degree of symmetry for the codimension - one slices .",
    "because the classical action consists of a bulk and boundary term , if the geometries of the possible bulk solutions are known as functions of the boundary variables one can find the on - shell euclidean actions purely in terms of the boundary variables .",
    "knowledge of the bulk geometries in relations to the boundary geometry is all that one needs to obtain for semi - classical considerations .",
    "however , it may not be possible to obtain the infilling geometries as analytic functions of the boundary data which then requires one to adopt an indirect approach .    for either ads@xmath10 or schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 , with the periodic identification of the @xmath30-coordinate ,",
    "a hypersurface at a constant value of the radial coordinate @xmath25 , say @xmath47 , has the trivial product topology @xmath48 and is endowed with the @xmath42-metric @xmath49 given by @xmath50 if one excises the part of the manifold for which @xmath51 one is left with a non - singular compact manifold with a boundary which , by construction , provides an infilling solution for @xmath43 .",
    "therefore for a given @xmath48 boundary there are two topologically distinct possibilities for the infillings .    comparing eqs",
    "( [ buonmet ] ) and ( [ shads ] ) , one obtains @xmath52 trivially for either ads@xmath10 or schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 . for a given @xmath53 boundary the periodicity of the @xmath30 coordinate of the ads@xmath10 metric is given by @xmath54 obviously for a given set @xmath14 the periodicity is unique the `` radius '' of the @xmath4 fibre , would avoid the recurrent appearance of @xmath55 in the rest of the paper . ] . on the other hand , for schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 one",
    "needs to find the periodicity via ( [ per ] ) by solving the following equation for @xmath26 first : @xmath56 this is the standard relationship between the local temperature at the cavity wall and the hawking temperature @xmath57 eq.([mast ] ) leads to a complicated algebraic expression in @xmath26 .",
    "obviously there is no _ a priori _ obstruction as one can _ start _ with a schwarzschild - ads with known mass and take a constant @xmath25-slice for which eq.([mast ] ) is true trivially .",
    "however , it is not clear for what values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 black - hole solutions exist and what their possible number and properties are",
    ". we will be addressing these questions in the following sections . but",
    "before doing that we briefly recapitulate what we know about the @xmath13 case which is a limiting case of the present study ( i.e. @xmath58 limit ) .",
    "the results for @xmath13 will be a constant reference for judging success of the @xmath15 case .",
    "the results for @xmath13 will also help us understand the limit when the cavity radius is very small compared to @xmath59 , i.e. , when @xmath60 .      for @xmath13 , eq.([mast ] )",
    "simplifies considerably and can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are in general two solutions if @xmath64 for a given @xmath5 , this sets an upper limit to @xmath6 , i.e. , this gives a lower limit to the temperature of the cavity - wall @xmath65 for @xmath66 no black - hole solution exists . for @xmath67",
    "the two solutions are degenerate and is given by @xmath68 for @xmath69 , there are always two positive roots of eq.([mast0 ] ) . for a given cavity",
    ", the higher the wall - temperature the heavier ( lighter ) is the larger ( smaller ) solution .    for four dimensions the eq.([mast0 ] ) is cubic and is solvable @xcite .",
    "however , apart from a few other special values of @xmath42 this is not solvable using ordinary algebraic methods",
    ". fortunately , eq.([mast0 ] ) falls under a special class of algebraic equations  commonly known as trinomial equations in the mathematical literature  which can be solved using higher order hypergeometric functions in one variable . for arbitrary @xmath42 and @xmath70 the solutions",
    "have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus the corresponding riemannian dirichlet problem is exactly solvable for arbitrary dimension .",
    "for @xmath13 the problem reduces to studying eq.([mast0 ] ) for which it is only the squashing @xmath71 that matters . for @xmath15 , the analogue of eq.([mast0 ] ) reads @xmath72{\\rho}^{2}_{_b}+\\frac{1}{4}{\\alpha}^{n-2}{\\beta}^{2}\\left ( n-2\\right ) ^{2}=0 \\label{eq}.\\ ] ]    this is obtained from eq.([mast ] ) by simply eliminating the square - root and using eq.([massads ] ) . since @xmath26 and @xmath36 are in 1 - 1 correspondence both are in principle equivalent variables .",
    "however , use of @xmath36 leads to algebraic simplifications , albeit the resulting equation is still difficult to solve exactly .",
    "only the positive roots @xmath73 of eq.([eq ] ) will give the mass and hence the geometries of the infilling black holes .",
    "note that eq.([eq ] ) can not be reduced to a one - parameter problem by any redefinition of variables .",
    "this is true even for the infinite cavity limit although a different kind of simplification occurs in this limit .",
    "the infinite cavity limit has been studied rigorously in @xcite and will occur as a special case in our study .    in four dimensions eq.([eq ] ) is quintic and hence , ordinary algebraic methods fail to produce analytic solutions for the masses of the two black holes for four dimensions in terms of radicals unlike the @xmath13 case found in @xcite .",
    "one can , however , solve eq.([eq ] ) in terms of hypergeometric functions by following birkeland s general solution of algebraic equations of order @xmath42 with arbitrary coefficients @xcite or by using @xmath74-hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "unlike the @xmath13 case , the solutions will be in terms of hypergeometric functions of _ several _ variables .",
    "the variables will be non - trivial functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this method would be unsuitable for obtaining direct information as the cavity radius and temperature are varied and hence will not be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we will return to the issue of explicit solutions in five dimensions in section 5 .",
    "however , as we will see below it is possible to study the infilling solutions and their thermodynamics without requiring explicit solutions .      as mentioned earlier , the only study for finite cavity was made in @xcite for four spacetime dimensions .",
    "it was shown there that there are two black hole solutions with negative and positive specific heats within the cavity .",
    "both survive in the infinite cavity - radius limit unlike the schwarzschild case in flat space .",
    "we will now see that this is true for higher dimensions as well .",
    "it is easy to see that eq.([eq ] ) does not admit positive solutions if @xmath75 since no changes of sign occur in the coefficients of the various powers which are all positive in this case",
    ". only the coefficient of @xmath76 can be negative and this happens if @xmath77 there can be up to two positive roots and up to two ( for @xmath42 even ) or three ( for @xmath42 odd ) negative roots .",
    "note that ( [ sign2 ] ) places a necessary , and not a sufficient condition on @xmath6 ( equivalently @xmath78 ) . for @xmath42",
    "even , the quantity @xmath79 is positive and hence there can never be one positive root and one negative root . the possibility of having a single positive root",
    "is thus ruled out ( a double - root is counted twice ) .",
    "since complex roots appear in pairs , similar arguments apply for @xmath42 odd .",
    "thus , _ there will be two positive roots ( double root counted twice ) or no positive roots_. only the positive roots which are less then the cavity radius @xmath5 can qualify as black - hole solutions inside the cavity .",
    "it is easy to check that this would automatically be the case for the two possible positive roots of eq.([eq ] ) . to see this rewrite eq.([eq ] ) in the following form : @xmath80 @xmath81 is a single - valued function of @xmath36 and is positive if and only if @xmath82 .",
    "it is continuous and well - defined within this interval ( the denominator is strictly positive ) .",
    "this is true for @xmath83 and for any positive value of @xmath5 . since the maximum number of positive roots of eq.([eq ] ) is two , it immediately follows that @xmath81 grows from zero ( at @xmath84 ) and ends with zero ( at @xmath85 ) with _ one _ `` hump '' in the middle , i.e. , @xmath81 increases monotonically to a maximum @xmath86 and then decreases monotonically to zero ( fig . 5.1 ) . therefore there will be two @xmath36 , i.e. , two black - hole solutions for a given boundary with specified @xmath14 provided @xmath6 ( or @xmath78 ) is equal to or less ( greater ) than the minimum value needed for the cavity radius of @xmath5 . because @xmath6 is a continuous function of @xmath36 within the interval @xmath87",
    "the two black - hole solutions exist for any temperature above the minimum value without any discontinuity .",
    "this holds for arbitrary cavity - radius .",
    "the minimum temperature needed for the solutions to exist is a function of the radius of the cavity and will be discussed in section 5.3.4 .",
    "note that the shape of the curve for @xmath81 as a function of @xmath36 is not obvious from eq.([betaasrho ] ) alone because of the non - triviality of the denominator .",
    "the fact that there will be two / no positive roots , as we have shown before , is crucial to the argument for the general number of solutions .      for a cavity of fixed radius",
    "the minimum temperature @xmath89 required for the black - hole solutions to exist is the one corresponding to the maximum of @xmath90 at which the solutions are degenerate . by differentiating eq.([betaasrho ] ) one obtains that at @xmath91 @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the value corresponding to the maximum ( minimum ) of @xmath6 ( @xmath78 ) ( and does not stand for the minimum / maximum value of @xmath36 ) .",
    "one obtains the minimum temperature as a function of the cavity radius by directly substituting the root of eq.([minmin ] ) in eq.([betaasrho ] ) ) has a positive root in the interval @xmath87 .",
    "however , this trivially follows from our previous analysis . ] .",
    "however , note that , like eq.([eq ] ) , eq.([minmin ] ) is not generally solvable using ordinary algebraic methods .    for @xmath94 ,",
    "all terms in eq.([minmin ] ) are positive except the last .",
    "it therefore follows that @xmath95 implying @xmath96 after dividing eq.([minmin ] ) by @xmath97 it is easy to see that the larger the value of @xmath5 the larger is @xmath98 .",
    "this accounts for the gradual shift of the peak to the right in fig .",
    "5.1 for larger values of cavity radius . at the infinite cavity limit ( [ upp ] )",
    "is replaced by an equality giving @xmath99 exactly .",
    "this therefore gives an absolute upper bound on the horizon radius , and hence the entropy , of the smaller black hole irrespective of the cavity radius and temperature .",
    "note that eq.([uppbonn ] ) can be obtained by differentiating the hawking temperature given by the inverse of @xmath100 . with a finite cavity , one needs to vary the product of the hawking temperature multiplied by the tolman red - shift factor for which the extremum occurs at a different value of @xmath36 . for finite cavity",
    "this value of @xmath36 is less than that obtained by varying the hawking temperature alone which is eq.([uppbonn ] ) and gradually increases asymptotically to ( [ uppbonn ] ) as one increases the cavity radius .      the difficulties in obtaining exact solutions of eq.([minmin ] )",
    "does not preclude us from observing the following general fact : @xmath101 increases with decreasing radius of the cavity .",
    "this is because the curve for @xmath6 as a function of @xmath102 for any fixed value @xmath5 of the cavity radius completely covers the curve corresponding to a lower value of @xmath5 .",
    "we have already noticed this from fig .",
    "5.1 . to see that this holds in general consider the converse :",
    "if two curves of @xmath6 ( corresponding to two different values of cavity radius @xmath5 ) as a function of @xmath103 meet at some point in the @xmath104 plane , the two values of @xmath5 should satisfy eq.([eq ] ) for the same pair @xmath105 . treating eq.([eq ] ) as an equation for @xmath5 , it is easy to see that there can be only one / no positive solution for @xmath5 for a given @xmath105 . therefore nowhere in the @xmath104 plane can two curves corresponding to two different values of @xmath5 meet .",
    "the curves corresponding to lower values of @xmath5 will be within the envelopes of those corresponding to higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the minimum temperature @xmath88 needed for the existence of two black - hole solutions increases with decreasing cavity radius .",
    "since @xmath6 ( as a function of @xmath36 ) is continuous , for any arbitrarily higher temperature the two solutions continue to exist .    as derivatives of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath5",
    "are smooth , the curves in the @xmath104 plane for various values of @xmath5 fill in densely .",
    "the two dimensional surface of eq.([eq ] ) in the @xmath106 space is therefore smooth and continuous .",
    "therefore @xmath88 is a smooth function of the cavity radius and increases with decreasing value of the radius .",
    "it remains to see whether it is possible to obtain @xmath88 as a function of the cavity radius .",
    "we will return to this issue in section 5.1 .",
    "for any finite schwarzschild - ads black hole the local temperature at infinity is zero .",
    "therefore the above picture  where one fixes the cavity radius and its wall - temperature  is not well - defined in the infinite limit of the cavity in the case of schwarzschild - ads .",
    "one can not simply fix a non - zero temperature at infinity and look for a finite schwarzschild - ads black - hole solution in the interior .",
    "this , however , is only possible in the @xmath13 limit .",
    "for vanishing temperature at infinity all schwarzschild - ads black holes are equally good infilling solutions",
    ".    however , the product of the local temperature and the cavity radius is well - defined in the infinite cavity limit fibre and the @xmath3 base remains finite . ] .",
    "this product essentially is the hawking temperature ( [ hawk ] ) and substitutes the wall - temperature of the cavity in this limit .",
    "one can now study the thermodynamics of black holes in terms of the hawking temperature alone .",
    "this has been done in @xcite . for a given hawking temperature",
    ", there are in general two black holes  this corresponds to the doubled - valuedness of the former as one can see from ( [ hawk ] ) .",
    "the hawking temperature has a minimum , @xmath107 which corresponds to a horizon - radius of @xmath108 in conformity with our analysis above .",
    "the mass of one hole decreases and the other increases as one raises the hawking temperature .",
    "one can immediately see the simplifications arising in the infinite limit of the cavity .",
    "it is rather trivial to find the masses of the two black holes from the hawking temperature ( [ hawk ] ) in contrast to the finite - cavity case where one needs to solve ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "further simplification arises in this limit when one considers semi - classical implications .",
    "this will appear in the next section in which we will explore the semi - classical implications for arbitrary finite cavity from which known results in the infinite limit of the cavity will be reproduced as a special case .",
    "our discussion so far was purely classical .",
    "however , it has set the ground for semi - classical considerations as we will see below .",
    "first , let us briefly recall the facts for @xmath13 case .",
    "we have already mentioned that the dirichlet problem is exactly solvable in this case .",
    "this enables one to find the classical actions @xmath109 of the infilling black - hole solutions as functions of boundary variables and thus study semi - classical physics .",
    "the specific heat of the larger solution is positive and that of the smaller solution is negative . from the action one",
    "also finds that the larger mass solution in @xmath40-dimensions , which has a positive specific heat , has a lower action than hot flat space , for temperatures @xcite @xmath110 the lower mass solution always has a larger action than flat space . thus above @xmath111",
    "the larger black - hole solution can spontaneously nucleate from hot flat space within the cavity in a thermodynamically consistent manner in which the free energy of the system , @xmath112 , does not increase .",
    "as one takes the cavity radius to infinity the larger solution fills in the entire cavity irrespective of its wall temperature and hence becomes irrelevant and only the smaller solution exists .",
    "therefore , black - hole nucleation is thermodynamically consistent only within a finite cavity .",
    "note that the critical temperature @xmath113 is inversely proportional to the cavity radius and is higher than the minimum temperature @xmath88 ( [ flatmin ] ) needed for the two black hole solutions to exist _",
    "classically_. we will see below that the situation is similar for anti - de sitter space as well . to the best of our knowledge , such a study has not been carried out before for four or higher dimensions except the study made in infinite cavity limit in @xcite and which will reappear as a special case below .",
    "for an @xmath40-dimensional manifold @xmath114 with an @xmath42-dimensional boundary @xmath115 , the euclidean action is @xcite : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the metric on @xmath118 and @xmath49 is the induced @xmath42-metric on the boundary , i.e. , @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath120 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath121 of the boundary defined according to the convention that the outward normal to the boundary is positive .",
    "the einstein equation obtained from this action is @xmath122 . recall that @xmath123 and that we set @xmath23 .",
    "the on - shell action therefore reads @xmath124 the first integral is the @xmath40-volume of @xmath118 and the second integral geometrically is the rate of change of the @xmath42-volume of the boundary @xmath115 along the unit outward normal .    for a schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 with an @xmath2 boundary at a constant radial distance",
    "it is fairly straightforward to calculate both of above bulk and boundary contributions to the on - shell action .",
    "they respectively are @xmath125 and @xmath126 recalling that @xmath127 , one obtains @xmath128 in the convention the @xmath40-dimensional schwarzschild - ads and ads metrics have been written , the base manifold @xmath3 ( with the canonical round metric on it ) satisfies the @xmath34-dimensional einstein equation with a cosmological constant @xmath34 .",
    "this is what is referred to as the `` unit '' @xmath34-dimensional sphere in the literature .",
    "its volume @xmath129 .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "first , note that the action ( [ totact1 ] ) is in terms of horizon radius .",
    "the actions for the two infilling black hole solutions in terms of the boundary variables @xmath14 are obtained from it via substitution once the two solutions of ( [ eq ] ) are known .",
    "this takes us back to the classical dirichlet problem ; explicit expressions for actions can be obtained only when we know the explicit solutions of the infilling geometries . also note that action ( [ totact1 ] ) is finite for finite @xmath5 .",
    "hence , there is no _ a priori _ need to do a background subtraction ( by taking off the action of ads ) in this case to make the action finite as is needed in the infinite cavity limit @xcite .",
    "however , such a subtraction will appear in the next section in the course of determining which classical solution will dominate the path - integral for varying cavity radius and its wall temperature .",
    "the canonical entropy of the system is @xmath130 in which the derivative is evaluated while keeping the area of cavity fixed .",
    "the variation of @xmath6 changes @xmath109 through variation of the mass , or equivalently the horizon radius @xmath36 of an infilling hole , and so @xmath131 one calculates the above two derivative terms using ( [ totact1 ] ) and ( [ betaasrho ] ) . after some lengthy algebra one finds @xmath132 precisely .",
    "this shows that the universal law of black - hole entropy remains valid for such boundary conditions .",
    "this , to our knowledge , is the first derivation of this result via the semi - classical path - integral approach .",
    "it now immediately follows from the area - law and the study we made in section 3.4 on the variation of the mass of the two holes as functions of wall - temperature that the specific heat @xmath133 is positive for the larger black hole and negative for the smaller black hole , and hence they are thermodynamically stable and unstable respectively .",
    "the specific heat is zero when the two solutions are degenerate .      to see that a phase transition from hot ads to schwarzschild - ads can occur within the cavity",
    ", we need to compare the action of the infilling schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 solutions with that of hot ads@xmath10 space which is unique for any given @xmath134 boundary .",
    "we do so by computing the actions of the infilling schwarzschild - ads@xmath10 solutions in the `` background '' of the hot unique ads@xmath10 space , i.e. , by subtracting the action of the ads@xmath10 from that of the black hole ( [ totact1 ] ) . in the infinite limit of the cavity",
    "this calculation simplifies as the boundary terms of the ads and schwarzschild - ads cancel @xcite .",
    "this simplification does not exists for the finite cavity .",
    "compared to the @xmath13 case , on the other hand , the periodically identified ads space has a non - trivial tolman redshift factor .",
    "this makes the boundary term more important and the corresponding calculation more delicate than in flat space @xcite .",
    "one therefore needs to be cautious in subtracting the ads action from the schwarzschild - ads action in the case of finite cavity .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "first calculate the volume and boundary terms for ads@xmath10 .",
    "they respectively are @xmath135 and @xmath136 where @xmath137 as given by eq.([dirads00 ] ) .",
    "since the infilling hot ads@xmath10 space and the two infilling black holes have the same @xmath42-metric on the @xmath48 boundary , we can replace @xmath6 using eq.([mast ] ) , giving @xmath138 where @xmath26 is either of the two infilling black hole masses .",
    "the reason for replacing @xmath6 is to express the action in the same form as the black - hole action .",
    "the volume and the boundary terms for ads@xmath10 then read @xmath139 @xmath140 note that because periodically identified ads@xmath10 space has a non - trivial tolman shift factor unlike hot flat space , the boundary term ( [ bunads ] ) contains contributions from the changes in the volume of cavity as well as the local temperature along the radial direction of the cavity , or equivalently , in the euclidean language : both changes in the @xmath3 base as well as the radius of the @xmath4-fire at the @xmath2 boundary along the outward normal .",
    "the action of a black hole minus that of hot ads therefore reads @xmath141 where , for short - hand , @xmath142 the action for either of the two infilling black holes is found by substituting the corresponding solutions of @xmath36 of eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "the actions are then functions of cavity radius and the wall temperature , i.e. expressed in terms of boundary data .",
    "therefore once analytic solutions of eq.([eq ] ) are known the actions are known exactly .",
    "the action ( [ actionsubs ] ) is a smooth , single - valued function of @xmath36 .",
    "it is zero for @xmath84 and for @xmath36 small ( compared to @xmath5 ) the first two terms in the bracket dominate and",
    "the action is positive .",
    "as one increases @xmath36 it grows monotonically to a maximum value and then decreases monotonically to @xmath143 corresponding to @xmath144 .",
    "this is negative definite .",
    "the overall behaviour is similar to that in flat - space @xcite .",
    "below ( figure 2 - 3 ) we plot @xmath109 for various values of @xmath5 for @xmath145 . we choose four dimensions here because of its obvious physical importance and also because the case of five dimensions , which is physically interesting from a holographic point of view , will be discussed in detail in the section 5 .",
    "we set @xmath146 .",
    "( @xmath147),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]     ( @xmath148),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]    this phase transition , however , is in terms of the horizon radius ( equivalently , the mass ) of a black hole within the cavity .",
    "this shows that within any finite cavity for sufficiently large value of its horizon radius schwarzschild - ads becomes more probable than hot ads .",
    "this phase transition is possible for any value of the cavity radius and is physical , i.e. the black hole does not engulf the cavity .",
    "however , to revert to the canonical language we need to understand how the phase transition takes place as function the temperature of the wall instead of horizon - radius ( or mass ) of the hole while the radius of the cavity is held fixed .",
    "this needs care and is not obvious because of the double - valuedness of the infilling black - holes solutions .",
    "can both of the two black - holes have larger action than ads ?",
    "does the scenario vary with varying radius of the wall ? to answer these questions we need to recall what we have learned about the classical nature of the two solutions within the cavity .",
    "it is not difficult to see that it is the larger mass solution that nucleates from hot ads for sufficiently high temperature of the heat - bath .",
    "the action ( [ actionsubs ] ) of the lower mass solution is always positive thus making it the least probable solution semi - classically . to see this recall that there is an absolute upper bound , @xmath149 , of the horizon radius of the smaller black hole .",
    "when the cavity radius is not too small the action ( [ actionsubs ] ) will always be positive within this range ( figure 3 ) . on the other hand , when the cavity is small the action ( [ actionsubs ] ) ( as well as the overall scenario ) approaches the flat - space limit ( see figure 2 above ) and remains positive for the smaller hole as discussed briefly above and in detail in @xcite .",
    "therefore the action of the lower mass black hole is always positive irrespective of the cavity radius and temperature .",
    "only the action of the larger mass hole is negative for @xmath150 and remains so for all higher temperatures .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath113 can be found by equating ( [ endact ] ) to zero and eliminating the square roots .",
    "in @xmath40 dimensions this gives us an equation @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the radius of the larger black hole at the critical temperature .",
    "once the solution of this equation is found , @xmath113 is determined via ( [ betaasrho ] ) .",
    "note that this equation has an appearance similar to eq.([minmin ] ) . using the identical arguments used for eq.([minmin ] )",
    "it is easy to demonstrate that for large value of the cavity - radius @xmath153 tends to unity . also , this value is the upper bound to @xmath152 .",
    "this is because like eq.([minmin ] ) , the coefficients of various powers in ( [ mama ] ) do not involve the cavity radius . as in the case of @xmath13 , the horizon - radius of the nucleated black hole ( or its mass ) at the critical temperature increases with the cavity radius .",
    "therefore this provides us with another example in which a sharp contrast exists between the @xmath15 and @xmath13 cases .",
    "we will come back to this issue in the next section when we discuss five dimensions specifically and in the conclusion .      for large @xmath5 @xmath154",
    "therefore for @xmath155 one obtains the following action of @xcite @xmath156 giving the hawking - page phase transition at @xmath157 .",
    "this action is certainly much simpler than its finite boundary analogue ( [ actionsubs ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to check the area - law of entropy and from it the specific heats of the two solutions .",
    "following our discussion in section 3.6 on the hawking temperature it is easy to see that the specific heat expression ( [ ent ] ) @xmath158 essentially reduces to one where @xmath78 can be replaced by @xmath159 , the hawking temperature .",
    "thus for any value of the hawking temperature ( above the minimum @xmath160 , of course ) , the larger and the smaller black hole solutions will have positive and negative specific heats respectively . the critical ( hawking ) temperature in this case is @xmath161 , as one can check easily .",
    "we have already remarked that eq.([eq ] ) is a quintic in four dimensions and the degree of this equation increases linearly with dimensionality .",
    "however , an observation that we have not made so far is that in odd dimensions eq.([eq ] ) is an equation in @xmath162 . for five and seven dimensions eq.([eq ] ) is cubic and quartic respectively and can be solved exactly using ordinary algebraic methods .",
    "thus the dirichlet problem in these dimensions is exactly solvable and one obtains the bulk geometries in terms of the boundary variables . from a holographic perspective",
    "five dimensions is special and we will treat it in detail . in this case eq.([eq ] ) reads @xmath163z+{\\alpha}^{2}{\\beta}^{2}=0 \\label{eq5}.\\ ] ] in which we have substituted @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "the three roots of ( [ eq5 ] ) are given by cardano s solution of the cubic : @xmath166 @xmath167 and @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 and @xmath171 as usual with cardano s solutions , the three roots of eq.([eq5 ] ) are given in an imaginary form and hence it is not obvious which two are positive . however , since we know that they will be positive / complex together , it is easy to single out the expressions for the two positive roots ; they are @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( see below ) .",
    "these two solutions therefore give the masses of the two black holes , and hence the infilling geometries in terms of the boundary data .      in finding various other quantities of interest one",
    "still needs to be judicious in choosing the correct algebraic approach as we will see below .",
    "first we would like to know @xmath88 ( above which the two black hole solutions classically ) as function of cavity radius .",
    "this has been discussed qualitatively in section 3.4 for arbitrary dimensions . to find @xmath88 exactly ,",
    "one is required to find the positive root of ( [ minmin ] ) and then obtain @xmath88 from ( [ betaasrho ] ) . for five dimensions this is possible as ( [ minmin ] ) simplifies to a cubic equation like ( [ eq5 ] ) . however , the resulting algebraic expression for @xmath88 will not be economical and easy to simplify .",
    "a much nicer algebraic expression follows if one considers eq.([eq5 ] ) directly and makes use of the known algebraic methods .",
    "eq.([eq5 ] ) admits a negative root and pair of positive or complex roots .",
    "these positive roots are in 1 - 1 correspondence with the two positive roots of eq.([eq ] ) ( for @xmath174 ) and hence all qualitative observations made earlier apply directly . in particular , the positive roots of eq.([eq5 ] ) will appear and disappear simultaneously together with the two positive roots of eq.([eq ] ) as @xmath6 is varied . because it is cubic and has a negative root , if we ensure that eq.([eq5 ] ) has all real roots then two of them will be positive automatically and will correspond to the two schwarzschild - ads@xmath175 infilling geometries . the condition for a cubic equation to have all three roots real is well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this case",
    "it reads @xmath176 when the equality of this equation holds , the two positive roots of are degenerate .",
    "therefore the maximum value of @xmath177 is simply the solution of @xmath178 this is cubic in @xmath179 and admits a unique positive root for any value of @xmath5 giving @xmath180 where @xmath181 this is plotted in figure 4 .",
    "the smaller the cavity the higher is @xmath89 in concordance with our observations in section 3 ( and figure 1 ) .",
    "the action ( [ totact1 ] ) in five dimensions is @xmath182 the actions of the two black holes are found by substituting @xmath183 and @xmath184 in it .",
    "the action in the background of hot ads space given by ( [ actionsubs ] ) reads @xmath185 in which @xmath186 again it is possible to find the actions of the two black holes by substituting @xmath183 and @xmath184 directly in ( [ 5.12 ] ) .",
    "we have already shown that a phase transition takes the hot ads to the larger mass schwarzschild - ads irrespective of the radius of the cavity if the temperature of the cavity is above a certain critical value .",
    "this critical value of temperature @xmath113 is a function of cavity radius .",
    "we found that the radius of the black hole at the critical temperature of a cavity does not increase indefinitely with the cavity radius as in the case of vacuum . with the simplification arising in the case of five dimensions we are able to treat these issues exactly .",
    "first the radius of the black hole at the critical temperature is obtained by equating ( [ 5.12 ] ) to zero ( or just setting @xmath174 in ( [ mama ] ) ) : @xmath187 for any value of @xmath5 this has one positive root .",
    "again this is cubic and hence can be solved exactly .",
    "the square - root of the positive solution of eq.([positive ] ) @xmath152 is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "we do not write the explicit form solution here to save space .",
    "the critical radius is thus found as an exact function of the cavity radius and allows us to find the critical temperature @xmath113 needed for the cavity to undergo a semi - classical phase transition .",
    "it is obtained simply by substituting the solutions of eq.([positive ] ) in ( [ betaasrho ] ) for @xmath174 .",
    "again , we do not mention the explicit solution here as the form is not particularly illuminating .",
    "we plot @xmath113 as a function of the cavity radius in figure 6 .",
    "in this paper we studied the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes in anti - de sitter space within a cavity immersed in an isothermal bath as functions of the cavity radius and its wall - temperature , i.e. , the temperature of the bath .",
    "this led us to consider the associated dirichlet boundary - value problem in riemannian geometry for an @xmath134 boundary specified by its two radii @xmath188 .",
    "the connection between the lorentzian and the euclidean pictures are such that the circumference of the @xmath4 fibre gives the inverse temperature of the bath .",
    "two topologically distinct infillings are possible ",
    "one with a nut ( the euclidean ads ) and the other with a bolt ( the euclidean schwarzschild - ads ) . in the latter case one finds that the infilling geometry is double - valued and exists for a restricted range in the @xmath189 plane , for a boundary which is a non - trivial @xmath4-bundle over @xmath9 the number of regular bolt - type infillings ( taub - bolt - ads infillings ) can be as high as ten @xcite while the nut - type infillings ( self - dual taub - nut - ads infillings ) are unique @xcite , in the case of the latter explicit solutions can be obtained . in the @xmath13 case , such boundaries are studied for arbitrary dimensions in @xcite where it is shown that bolt - type infillings are always double - valued with the only exception of eguchi - hanson metrics in which case the solutions are unique as in the case of all nut - type infillings . ] .",
    "we studied the condition on @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the existence of such classical infillings and explored the possibility of obtaining their explicit solutions in terms @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or @xmath78 ) .",
    "we then considered which solutions will dominate the path integral semi - classically as one varies the boundary data by computing their actions and studying them carefully .",
    "we found the overall qualitative picture to be similar to that found in flat space @xcite : for any value of the wall temperature a unique hot ads solution exists whereas for wall - temperatures below a minimum value @xmath88 no schwarzschild - ads solutions exist . above this temperature",
    "there are two black - hole solutions which continue to exist for all higher temperatures .",
    "as one increases the temperature of the cavity the larger hole becomes heavier and the smaller one gets lighter .",
    "we found the on - shell action of the holes and showed that the standard area - law of black - hole entropy holds for such boundary conditions from which one can immediately deduce that the larger and the smaller holes have positive and negative specific heats respectively as in the flat space case . at @xmath88 ,",
    "both of the black holes have a positive action and hence the ads infilling is most probable and continues to remain so until a critical temperature @xmath113 is reached when the action of the larger hole is zero . for @xmath150 the action of the larger hole becomes negative definite .",
    "note that as one increases the temperature of the cavity from @xmath88 , the mass of the smaller hole decreases and its action decreases monotonically ( and reaches zero at infinite temperature ) .",
    "but , although its mass increases monotonically with temperature , the action of the larger hole increases only up to a certain positive value before it starts decreasing monotonically to zero at @xmath113 and becomes more negative for increasing temperatures and reaches a fixed value ( [ endact ] ) at infinite temperature .",
    "this picture is the same for an arbitrary value of the cavity radius and quantitatively approaches the flat space limit for small radii .",
    "both @xmath88 and @xmath113 decrease for larger value of the cavity radius as in flat space .",
    "however , despite the similarity , we have noted certain differences between the @xmath15 and @xmath13 cases . as we have seen in section 3.4",
    ", there is an absolute upper bound on the horizon radius of the smaller hole for @xmath15 whereas there is no such absolute limit in the case of @xmath13  the upper limit in this case is only on @xmath190 which translates to the limit ( [ massflat ] ) .",
    "another difference that occurs is in the horizon radius of the larger hole nucleated at the critical temperature .",
    "this approaches an absolute value of unity ( in the units of the paper ) for @xmath15 . in the flat space limit",
    "this gets larger and larger for higher values of the cavity radius .    in the infinite limit of the cavity ,",
    "on the other hand , the above study reduces to the study made in @xcite .",
    "we have shown how this happens and how the only meaningful thermodynamic variable in this limit is the hawking temperature . in the euclidean picture",
    ", this corresponds to the fact that it is only the ratio of the radii of the fibre and the base of the ( infinite boundary ) that is meaningful in this limit this , in fact , is pivotal for the ads / cft correspondence studied in @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding explicit masses of black hole solutions as functions of the hawking temperature and evaluation of other thermodynamic quantities simplifies enormously in this limit .",
    "note that the phase transition found in this paper for finite cavity does not follow from the hawking - page phase transition by means of logical extrapolation .",
    "this is because the larger black - hole solution and the hot ads solution which induce the same metric on the finite @xmath134-boundary , do not have the same @xmath134-metric at infinity and if they match near infinity they would not match anywhere at a finite radial distance . that there is only one meaningful variable at infinity is slightly analogous to the situation in the flat - space limit where ,",
    "although both the radii of the base and the fibre enter into the explicit solutions , it is only the squashing of the two radii that is truly meaningful as one can see from eq.([mast0 ] ) . in the case of",
    "finite @xmath191-boundary both of the radii play a non - trivial role for @xmath15 .",
    "all of the above results were obtained without taking recourse to explicit infilling black - hole solutions for which one needs to solve eq.([eq ] ) .",
    "this equation can not be simplified by some redefinition of variables and hence solutions are not possible for arbitrary dimensions .",
    "however , the case of five dimensions turns out to be rather special in which case this can be reduced to a cubic equation and hence one can solve it exactly using ordinary algebraic methods and thus obtaining the infilling black hole geometries as exact functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( or , @xmath78 ) .",
    "this makes it possible to compute the corresponding actions of the two black holes exactly as functions of the boundary variables .",
    "we have found @xmath88 and @xmath113 as exact functions of cavity radius .",
    "the latter is an exact geometric statement for any regular euclidean schwarzschild - ads metric .",
    "other quantities of interest can be computed from the action and the solutions by using their standard definitions .",
    "these exact results therefore provide a basis for further dynamical and thermodynamical study and should find applications in brane - world cosmology , holography and other related issues of current interest and are left for future investigations .",
