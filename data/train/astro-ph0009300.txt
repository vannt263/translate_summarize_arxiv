    "<S> the medium has many gas components , as known from radio measurements , probably released in dynamical interactions by galaxies in the group . </S>",
    "<S> the iue spectra contain the only uv absorption information on such gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find neutral and ionised gas absorption at the same velocity , having a metal content similar to a galactic disk .    </S>",
    "<S> we combine the spectra towards in with those towards in the lmc , the directions being essentially antipodes on the celestical sphere . comparing the total profile with qso spectra </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that most absorption in qso spectra occurs in diffuse clouds on those sight lines and is not similar to absorption by galactic disk gas </S>",
    "<S> . however , one absorption component towards is clearly very similar to some of the absorption components in qso spectra . </S>"
