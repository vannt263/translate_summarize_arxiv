    "the study of nonequilibrium phase behaviour in complex fluid systems provides a new challenge .",
    "specifically , in the case of surfactant systems , relaxation to equilibrium has recently attracted interest  @xcite . for example , this has been studied in phase penetration scan experiments  @xcite , and in directional growth studies  @xcite . in these experiments the evolution of a mesophase is followed in the presence of a concentration or temperature gradient respectively .",
    "this may result in unstable interfaces which can lead to spectacular instabilities .",
    "the kinetics of phase behaviour has been well studied in other areas of soft matter physics .",
    "for example the nucleation behaviour in colloid - polymer mixtures has been investigated experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . in these systems , three - phase samples consisting of colloidal gas , liquid and crystal , can be prepared at different compositions . in  @xcite",
    ", three - phase samples were homogenised and observed while equilibrating . by identifying the fast and slow composition variables in the system , and then considering the evolving free - energy landscape for the slow component , restrictions can be placed on the kinetic pathway the system will follow as it evolves towards equilibrium .",
    "this free - energy landscape theory  @xcite promises to be a powerful way to predict kinetic pathways , at least in systems where one combination of the composition variables evolves more slowly than the others , so that time scales can be separated .",
    "it is used below ( section  [ sdsdisc ] ) to give a possible explanation for the observations in surfactant systems that will be presented here ( section  [ results ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the temporal evolution of a two - phase system , comprising sponge ( @xmath1 ) and lamellar ( @xmath0 ) phase , and a three - phase system , comprising @xmath1 , @xmath0 and micellar ( @xmath2 ) phase , in samples that have been subjected to a temperature quench .",
    "using dark - field _ macroscopy _ ( explained below ) we have observed a number of interesting nonequilibrium features that occur as the sample progresses to its new equilibrium state . in the two - phase sample",
    "we have observed dense nucleation of lamellar phase droplets within @xmath1 which appear to form a ` gel ' of droplets that compacts over time .",
    "in addition , we present microscopic images of the ` gel ' formation . in three - phase samples we observed three regimes of behaviour .",
    "initially the sponge phase forms an _ emulsion _ which proceeds to a homogeneous sponge phase . in the second regime nucleation of lamellar phase in the sponge phase",
    "occurs close to the @xmath1/@xmath2 interface .",
    "the growing droplets rise through the @xmath1 phase and arrive at the @xmath1/@xmath0 interface , building up the @xmath0 phase over time .",
    "finally a _ plume _ pushes through the sponge phase connecting the @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "these results are described in section  [ results ] and discussed in section  [ sdsdisc ] .",
    "section  [ conc ] gives a brief conclusion .",
    "sds and octanol ( both @xmath3 purity ) were supplied by sigma - aldrich and used without further purification .",
    "samples were prepared by dissolving sds and octanol in brine ( @xmath4g / l of nacl in distilled water ) and then tumbled for 2 days and subsequently allowed to equilibrate at a higher temperature of @xmath5 .",
    "experiments were performed after approximately two weeks , when the samples had reached equilibrium .",
    "compared to a direct observation , dark - field macroscopy allows us to obtain better contrast from regions in the sample that scatter light only weakly  @xcite .",
    "the scattering of light is caused by refractive index inhomogeneities in the sample which , _",
    "e.g. _ , result from regions of different concentration .",
    "the term _ macroscopy _ is introduced since the sample is larger than its image , which matches the size of the ccd chip , and therefore the optical setup is designed to _ reduce _ the image size .",
    "we have used dark - field macroscopy to observe samples whose cell dimensions are @xmath6 .",
    "the general layout of the dark - field macroscope is similar to a dark - field microscope and shown in figure  [ darkf ] . a white light source and a collimator",
    "are used to produce parallel light to illuminate the sample which is placed in the object plane .",
    "the unscattered light is focused into the back focal plane of the objective .",
    "a beam stop is placed in this plane to black the unscattered light . in the case of no scattering",
    "the image is completely dark , hence the name dark - field .",
    "if there is scattered light , it is collimated by the objective and focused onto the ccd chip . therefore ,",
    "whenever there are refractive index differences in the sample these will appear as bright spots on a dark background .",
    "all samples observed are temperature controlled in a heat bath .",
    "all microscopy observations were made using an olympus bx50 microscope in bright - field mode between crossed polarisers with long working distance objectives .",
    "the evolution of the samples were recorded using a ccd camera and time lapse video recorder together with a framegrabber pc .",
    "the contrast of the presented images has been enhanced by thresholding .",
    "all microscopy experiments were done in a linkam lts hot - stage which ensured a controlled and stable temperature .",
    "we have studied two phase ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) and three - phase ( @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 ) samples upon a large temperature change .",
    "initially the samples are in equilibrium at @xmath7 where they have been observed for one week and showed no further change . the sample is then placed in the dark - field macroscope which is kept at a temperature of @xmath8 .",
    "its behaviour upon this temperature quench is then followed .",
    "we have studied samples with different bilayer ( sds + octanol ) concentrations and octanol / sds ratios .",
    "we will first present the typical behaviour of two phase and three phase samples , before we describe the dependence on octanol / sds ratio .",
    "temperature quench experiments on a two - phase sample ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) were performed for an octanol / sds ratio of 1.36 and a bilayer concentration of @xmath9 . at this composition and at a temperature of @xmath5",
    "the sample has two phases , @xmath0 at the top and @xmath1 on the bottom , where the @xmath1 phase is in abundance ( @xmath10 ) . at lower temperature ( @xmath11 )",
    "most of the volume ( @xmath12 ) of the sample is present as @xmath0 phase which replaces @xmath1 phase .",
    "when the sample is quenched from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , we have observed two regimes of behaviour . almost immediately ,",
    "( @xmath1 + @xmath0 ) nucleates in the @xmath1 phase and appears to completely fill the sample ( figure  [ twophase]a ) . over time",
    "this mixed sponge / lamellar phase decreases in volume and the pure sponge phase now reforms at the bottom of the sample ( figure  [ twophase]b ) . as the volume of ( @xmath1 + @xmath0 ) decreases there is a noticeable change in its texture .",
    "the lower part is rough in texture and separated by an interface from the top part which has a smooth texture ( figure  [ twophase]c ) .",
    "the rough texture appears to be a gel of @xmath0 droplets in @xmath1 ; this is confirmed by microscopy observations ( see below ) . over time",
    "the smooth part grows as the rough part shrinks ( figure  [ twophase]c - d ) .",
    "the final state of the sample ( not shown ) contains only a smooth lamellar phase in peaceful coexistence with the sponge phase where the two phases occupy comparable volumes of the sample .",
    "the same generic behaviour is observed in samples with octanol / sds ratios up to 1.44 at 30@xmath13 bilayer concentration . in figure  [ gelprof1 ]",
    "the relaxation to equilibrium observed with these samples is schematically presented .      to obtain more detailed information , part of the sponge phase",
    "was extracted from a two - phase sample .",
    "it was subsequently observed with a microscope during a temperature ramp from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "droplets of @xmath0 phase , which have the birefringent ` maltese cross ' signature of multilamellar vesicles or onions , are observed to nucleate homogeneously in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "these droplets continue to grow to @xmath14 over the next 60 minutes ( figures  [ onigel]a - c ) .",
    "however , after 30 minutes the onions start to move towards each other forming an onion ` gel ' ( figure  [ onigel]d ) .",
    "this structure coarsens over time leaving voids of pure sponge phase ( figure  [ onigel]e - f ) . as more onions form in the @xmath1 phase they coalesce .",
    "the heterogeneity of the gel is presumably responsible for the rough texture reported above .",
    "figure  [ spongeoni ] shows a close - up of two droplets , with maltese crosses visible , when observed through partially crossed polars . in this case",
    "the two droplets have partially merged . on closer inspection",
    "these lamellar droplets have a distinctive pattern of focal conic defects that form within the onion ( figure  [ epitax]a ) .",
    "these defects in the onion are presumably due to an epitaxial tilt of the bilayers at the surface of the droplet , which is surrounded by sponge phase .",
    "this has also been observed at the interface between a homeotropic lamellar and sponge phase  @xcite .",
    "the epitaxial tilt is required to match the repeat distance in the lamellar phase onto the characteristic bilayer spacing in the sponge ( figure  [ epitax]b ) .",
    "this observation suggest that , at the observed temperature and time scales , the internal structure of each onion is capable of reorganizing to minimize the interfacial energy of the onion .",
    "samples within the three - phase region have been observed with @xmath15 and @xmath16 bilayer concentration over a range of octanol / sds ratio @xmath17 to @xmath18 . at these compositions and at @xmath7 , all samples consist of three phases : @xmath0 at the top , @xmath1 in the middle and @xmath2 on the bottom , where the @xmath1 phase has the largest volume . at a lower temperature of @xmath8",
    "most of the volume is occupied by @xmath0 phase with only a small volume of @xmath1 phase remaining .",
    "the @xmath2 phase is observed to have a slightly larger volume at @xmath19 than at @xmath5 .",
    "after a temperature quench from @xmath7 to @xmath8 the relaxation to equilibrium is found to proceed through three regimes .",
    "they are described below for a sample that has a bilayer concentration of @xmath15 and an octanol / sds ratio of @xmath17 .",
    "other three - phase samples behave in a similar fashion , although the time constants were found to depend on the actual composition .      after the temperature quench ,",
    "the @xmath1 phase becomes turbid as inhomogeneities form within it ( figure  [ tquenchi]a ) .",
    "this texture appears to be an emulsion of @xmath2 droplets separated by @xmath1 or vice versa .",
    "( see section  [ sdsdisc ] for a discussion ) .",
    "the texture is first seen close to the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface , and then spreads up to the @xmath1/@xmath0 interface while large convection currents are also observed within the @xmath1 phase .    in addition some large droplets of @xmath2 fall rapidly from the @xmath0 phase through the inhomogeneous @xmath1 phase into the @xmath2 phase ( figure  [ micdrops ] ) .",
    "these droplets are initially of a diameter of about @xmath20 and fall with speed @xmath21 . within 3 hours",
    "their size decreases to @xmath22 and their speed is reduced to @xmath23 .",
    "about one hour later the @xmath1 phase becomes homogeneous once again , by a clearing process which starts close to the @xmath1/@xmath0 interface .",
    "a schematic summary of these features is given in figure  [ timeprof ] .",
    "these features are typical of samples at @xmath24 bilayer composition with octanol / sds ratios @xmath25 .      after about one hour",
    ", droplets of @xmath0 phase of approximately @xmath26 in size begin to form in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "the number of @xmath0 drops observed increases over the next 30 minutes . while droplets are observed to nucleate throughout the @xmath1 phase , this mainly happens near the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface ( figure  [ tquenchii ] ) .",
    "the droplets move up towards the @xmath0 phase with a speed of about 4@xmath27 , gaining size as they do so . over a period of @xmath28",
    "days they build the @xmath0 phase .",
    "the quantity of the @xmath0 phase steadily increases , however after 12 hours the number of droplets within @xmath1 is observed to have decreased . eventually after about 36 hours further droplets",
    "are not observed to form despite the continuing growth of the lamellar phase .",
    "these findings are summarized schematically in fig .",
    "[ nucprof ] .    at larger bilayer concentrations ( @xmath29 )",
    "we have observed a much larger density of lamellar droplets in the @xmath1 phase . at a much larger octanol / sds ratio of 1.35 and 1.41",
    "the droplets that form are very dense .",
    "furthermore , by increasing the octanol / sds ratio , we have observed a noticeable change in the dynamics . at higher octanol / sds ratio",
    "we observe an increase in the rate of formation of the @xmath0 droplets and the speed of the droplets as they move towards the @xmath0 phase .",
    "after 36 hours the @xmath0 droplets are no longer observed to nucleate in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "however , the @xmath0 phase still continues to grow .",
    "eventually at some later time a plume grows from the @xmath2 phase and extends up to the @xmath0 phase ( figure  [ plume ] ) .",
    "prior to this , in the @xmath2 phase small droplets of @xmath0 phase are observed to move up towards the @xmath1/@xmath2 interface and eventually push their way through the @xmath1 phase by forming the plume .",
    "the plume connects the @xmath2 phase to the @xmath0 phase cutting straight through the @xmath1 phase .",
    "it is about @xmath30 in diameter . on the plume near",
    "the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface a large bulbous piece with a diameter of about @xmath31 can be observed .",
    "we followed the movement of this over the next 12 hours .",
    "initially the bulbous piece rises up toward the @xmath0/@xmath1 interface ( figure  [ plume]b - c ) .",
    "then it begins to move back towards the other interface ( figure  [ plume]c - e ) .",
    "eventually the plume detaches from the @xmath1/@xmath2 interface and the whole plume is ` pulled ' up into the @xmath0 phase ( figure  [ plume]e - g ) while the bulbous bit remains at the loose end of the plume .",
    "the only way to describe the motion of the plume is that it behaves in a ` lava - lamp ' like fashion .",
    "the occurrence of the plume is a reproducible effect and has been seen in many separate experiments .",
    "however , in the range of samples we have observed we only find plumes when there is @xmath2 phase present .",
    "depending on the composition we can even observe multiple plumes forming .",
    "the plumes are observed late in the lamellar nucleation regime .",
    "however , at larger octanol / sds ratios plumes form earlier in the @xmath0 nucleation regime .",
    "in addition , we have observed streaks in the @xmath1 phase at the @xmath0 interface , which persist for the remaining duration of the growth of @xmath0 .",
    "they are found during and after the formation of the plume .      as already mentioned in section  [ sec : nucgro ] , a higher octanol / sds ratio also results in an increase in the rate of formation of the @xmath0 droplets and the speed of the droplets as they move towards the @xmath0 phase .",
    "in addition , the density of droplets is increased upon an increase in the octanol / sds ratio . by varying the octanol content in the bilayer",
    "we influence the time scale of each regime that is observed .",
    "the initial regime , where we have observed the transient formation of a sponge emulsion , appears to persist for a shorter period of time as we increase the octanol / sds ratio .",
    "this is also the case for the second regime of lamellar nucleation and growth . furthermore the nucleation regime starts earlier for samples with higher octanol content so that these regimes overlap",
    "this is also the case for the observation of the plume which can be observed earlier at higher octanol / sds ratio .",
    "figure  [ regdiag ] gives a semi - quantitative diagram of these observations .",
    "an initially equilibrated sample that is subjected to a sudden temperature change will relax to a new equilibrium state . in three- and two - phase surfactant samples",
    "we have observed interesting behaviour as the samples proceed to this final equilibrium state .",
    "below we discuss these observations first for the three- and then for the two - phase samples .",
    "this will be followed by some possible explanations for the observed behaviour .      when the three phase sample is quenched from @xmath32 to @xmath8 the @xmath2 phase volume is found to increase during the early stages .",
    "this indicates that during the quench the majority phase , @xmath1 , increases its bilayer concentration with a concomitant reduction in its bilayer spacing , expelling @xmath2 .",
    "this would explain the formation of a ` sponge emulsion ' , which appears as an inhomogeneous texture ( figure  [ tquenchi ] ) .",
    "a minority of @xmath2 phase in sponge phase has previously been observed in other experiments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the subsequent separation of @xmath2 and @xmath1 phase may lead to the observed convection currents .",
    "the sample begins to homogenise again as the compositions reorganise into a more favourable state .",
    "the homogenisation of the @xmath1 phase is found to start at the @xmath0 phase and moves towards the @xmath2 phase .",
    "this is not surprising , since the @xmath2 phase has to drain through the sponge emulsion during the homogenisation process ( figure  [ tquenchi ] ) .    a similar decrease in bilayer spacing is also expected for the @xmath0 phase .",
    "consequently the bilayer concentration will increase and excess brine will be expelled , possibly together with a low concentration of surfactant and cosurfactant .",
    "it seems conceivable that this leads to the formation of droplets of @xmath2 within @xmath0 , which are then observed to fall through the @xmath1 phase ( figure  [ micdrops ] ) .",
    "as the equilibrium bilayer concentration is approached , the @xmath2 flux is reduced .",
    "this is reflected in the reduction of the @xmath2 droplet size and consequently leads to a reduction in the speed of the droplets .    by expelling excess brine ,",
    "both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 phase increase their bilayer concentration .",
    "the decrease in undulation repulsions between layers as a result of the lowered temperature seems likely to be responsible for this behaviour  @xcite .",
    "this change in bilayer concentration occurs during the early stages and appears to be much faster than reorganisation within the bilayer .",
    "the slower intra - bilayer reorganisation is thus expected to influence the behaviour during the subsequent stages .",
    "after the early stage described above ( and sometimes overlapping with it ",
    "see figure  [ regdiag ] ) , lamellar phase is found to nucleate and grow within @xmath1 at the expense of sponge phase .",
    "one of the most striking features of this process is that the nucleation of the @xmath0 phase in the @xmath1 phase is not homogeneous throughout the @xmath1 phase , but is most abundant close to the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface .",
    "it seems peculiar that such nucleation should occur in the part of the @xmath1 region _ furthest _ from the existing slab of @xmath33 phase .",
    "a possible explanation for this can be found by analysing the way the free energy landscape changes after the temperature jump  @xcite .",
    "first let us consider a three phase sample ( @xmath2,@xmath1,@xmath0 ) at equilibrium . to our knowledge",
    "there is no published phase diagram for this system that would show the phase boundaries close to the three - phase region .",
    "however , from our experience with these samples we present a schematic phase diagram of this region as a function of the volume fraction of sds @xmath34 and octanol @xmath35 ( figure  [ fsphase ] ) .",
    "figure  [ landscape6 ] gives a schematic free energy landscape that is consistent with the observed phase diagram of the system .",
    "the free energy of the sample in equilibrium is a function of the volume fractions of two independent components , sds and octanol .    at equilibrium the chemical potentials ( @xmath36 ) of each component",
    "must be equal in all of the coexisting phases , @xmath37 . the same also applies to the osmotic pressure of each phase .",
    "this means that the tangents ( shaded plane , fig .",
    "[ landscape6 ] ) to the free energy ` wells ' at the equilibrium compositions will all be the same .",
    "the points of tangency will correspond to the corners of the three - phase triangle on the phase diagram ( figure  [ fsphase ] ) .",
    "note that this analysis is invariant under arbitrary linear combination of the composition variables .",
    "here we will choose linear combinations @xmath38 as indicated in figure  [ fsphase ] .",
    "( these are related to the volume fraction of bilayer and the composition of the bilayer , respectively , as we discuss below . ) with these as the densities , the phase diagram looks like figure  [ landscape4 ] .",
    "now we ask : how does a three - phase sample ( marked in figure  [ landscape4 ] by ` @xmath39 ' ) change upon a temperature quench ?",
    "suppose at a given temperature its composition is close to the @xmath1 corner of the three - phase triangle ( gray area in figure  [ landscape4 ] ) .",
    "it thus mainly consists of @xmath1 , but also contains small amounts of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . upon a change in temperature the free energy landscape rearranges such that the free energy minima move to new positions .",
    "this changes the position of the three phase triangle ( dashed lines in figure  [ landscape4 ] ) .",
    "although the chemical composition of the sample remains constant , its relative position in the three - phase region is changed . in the case",
    "shown , it is now located much closer to the @xmath0 corner and also moved towards the @xmath2 corner .",
    "the sample is thus forced to change its compositions locally and nucleate @xmath0 and @xmath2 at the expense of @xmath1 .",
    "this is what happens in our three - phase samples when we quench from @xmath5 to @xmath8 .",
    "following reference  @xcite , a quasi - equilibrium free energy landscape can be constructed after the temperature quench if fast and slow composition variables can be identified .",
    "application of this _ free energy landscape _ analysis to our system depends on the relation between the fast and slow components ( @xmath38 ) and the volume fractions of octanol ( @xmath35 ) and sds ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "our observations indicate that changes in bilayer concentration occur during the early stages and can thus be identified with the fast component .",
    "in contrast , changes in the organisation of the bilayer such as the transition from @xmath1 to @xmath0 are found to happen later . from the phase diagram ( figure  [ fsphase ] ) it is clear that this @xmath1-@xmath0 transition must involve changes in the bilayer composition ( at nearly constant bilayer fraction ) .",
    "this is also supported by our separate observations of contact experiments between lamellar phase and water , where myelin patterns form  @xcite .    immediately after contact",
    "the myelin formation is always observed before the formation of any other intermediate phase , such as @xmath1 phase .",
    "thus the time for bilayers to swell to the miscibility gap is faster than the formation of sponge phase which requires local reorganisation in the bilayer structure , and also a change in its composition .",
    "we therefore assume that , starting from a given initial state , changes in volume fraction of the fast component @xmath41 correspond to changes in total bilayer concentration at fixed sds / octanol ratio .",
    "( this is expected to be a fast , ` collective diffusion ' mode . )",
    "we also assume that the slow component corresponds to changes in sds / octanol ratio at roughly fixed bilayer volume fraction .",
    "this second assumption is physically reasonable , but less obvious : formally , the fast and slow directions are eigenvectors of a diffusion matrix , which need not be symmetric , and they need not be at rightangles . however , if we make both assumptions , the fast and slow direction correspond to radial and tangential directions in figure  [ fsphase ] , which is probably a good enough approximation for the present discussion . for a state near the @xmath1 corner",
    "initially , these are as indicated in the figure .    for the fast component",
    ", the chemical potential @xmath42 will become uniform rapidly . essentially , we move to an equilibrium state through a sequence of metastable states , for which the chemical potential of the fast component @xmath43 is uniform .",
    "however , the value of @xmath43 is evolving in time and depends on the ( nonuniform ) evolution of the slow variable @xmath44 .",
    "instead of drawing the free energy landscape as a function of two components ( figure  [ landscape6 ] ) we now concentrate on the slow variable @xmath44 only .",
    "( this defines a free energy @xmath45 , as a function of @xmath44 in a semi - grand ensemble , under conditions of uniform , but time dependent , @xmath46 . )",
    "figure  [ phspace]a shows the initial ( equilibrium ) free energy landscape at high temperature as a function of the slow composition variable . after a temperature",
    "quench the three minima do not have a common tangent ( figure  [ phspace]b ) since @xmath43 has not yet relaxed to its equilibrium value and the initial condition now represents a metastable state . in this diagram",
    "we may assume that the free energy curve of @xmath1 phase lies higher than the common tangent of the other two so as to favour producing more @xmath2 and @xmath0 phase .",
    "( if the free energy minimum of @xmath1 phase is below the tangent of the other two then no nucleation will occur .",
    "in fact , this would be the case where the change in phase diagram is in the opposite direction to the one shown in figure  [ landscape4 ] . ) once the sample reaches equilibrium at the lower temperature , the three minima again have a common tangent ( a situation similar to figure  [ phspace]a is recovered ) .",
    "the local composition of the phases near their interfaces with one another can be determined from the _ metastable common tangents _ to the free energy landscape ( figure  [ phspace]b ) ; the compositions at each end of a tangent have the same chemical potential @xmath47 of the slow component which is the condition for _ local _ equilibrium of the interface . from these tangents , the local composition of the @xmath1 phase near to its interfaces can be determined .",
    "the @xmath1 phase will reorganise to have two different compositions , @xmath48 near the @xmath0/@xmath1 ( upper ) interface and @xmath49 near the @xmath1/@xmath2 ( lower ) interface .",
    "the @xmath1 phase thus has a higher bilayer volume fraction nearer the @xmath1/@xmath2 interface .",
    "the resulting composition profile as a function of sample height @xmath50 is shown in figure  [ phipro ] . since the nucleation of the phases @xmath0 and @xmath2 will be induced by composition fluctuations in @xmath1 phase",
    ", @xmath0 is more likely to nucleate close to the @xmath1/@xmath2 interface with its higher volume fraction .",
    "the difference in concentrations at the two interfaces requires a concentration gradient across the @xmath1 phase . since @xmath51 then the upper part of the phase has higher mass density than the lower part .",
    "( this could cause the system to become unstable under gravity . )",
    "the concentration gradient as well as gravity favours driving the @xmath0 droplets up towards the @xmath0 phase .    note that these features directly depend on the presence of the @xmath2 phase which fixes @xmath52 at the bottom of the sponge phase .",
    "also , the inversion of the concentration profile predicted by this model follows directly from the fact that the homogeneous @xmath1 region in the initial state is metastable : its common tangents to @xmath2 and @xmath0 cross each other ( figure  [ phspace]b ) .",
    "the formation of a plume which extends from the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface into the @xmath0 phase appears to result from the nucleation of lamellar phase in the @xmath2 phase .",
    "the formed lamellar phase might build up at the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface , because the density difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is very small and the surface tension between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is large .",
    "eventually the @xmath0 phase formed in the @xmath2 phase pushes through the sponge phase in a ` lava - lamp ' like fashion .",
    "the absence of the @xmath2 phase leads to a clearly different relaxation behaviour of the two - phase samples , although for both kinds of samples the main change upon a temperature quench from @xmath32 to @xmath8 is the formation of @xmath0 at the expense of @xmath1 phase .",
    "there is no indication for the formation of a ( metastable ) @xmath2 phase within the @xmath0 or @xmath1 phase during the early stages as observed for the three - phase samples .",
    "this could , however , be due to the large octanol / sds ratio of the two - phase samples , which leads to an overlap of the early stages and the lamellar nucleation in the case of the three phase sample ( figure  [ regdiag ] ) and could mask the ( intermediate ) formation of @xmath2 .    in the case of the two - phase samples ,",
    "the nucleation of @xmath0 occurs homogeneously throughout all of the @xmath1 phase . since only one interface ( @xmath0/@xmath1 ) is present",
    ", the @xmath1 phase can not develop a density inversion which could influence the local nucleation rate .",
    "the quantity of nucleating @xmath0 is large due to the relatively high bilayer concentration ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the nucleated @xmath0 droplets ( onions ) appear to form a dense network in the @xmath1 phase ( figure  [ onigel ] ) , similar to a colloidal gel structure .",
    "this is followed by a compaction process , which could be viewed as the drainage and collapse of a ` gel ' of @xmath0 droplets in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "( for analogous phenomena in colloids see  @xcite . ) due to the lower mass density of the @xmath0 phase , the onion ` gel ' collapses towards the upper phase boundary of the @xmath1 phase .",
    "this results in the observed smooth texture above the still uncompacted onion gel in the @xmath1 phase with its rough texture ( figures  [ twophase ] and  [ gelprof1 ] ) .",
    "this is reminiscent of the creaming of emulsions .",
    "the final equilibrium state of the two - phase samples consists of a completely compacted lamellar phase and ` pure ' @xmath1 phase .",
    "since there is no @xmath2 phase present , it is no surprise that the plume has not been observed in two - phase samples .",
    "we have performed a small number of experiments in which the temperature quench was reversed before the reorganization of the phases was complete . during an _ increase _ in temperature ,",
    "we have observed _ smectic bubbles _ in the @xmath1 phase .",
    "these are @xmath0 films which contain focal conic defects ( figure  [ onispon ] ) .",
    "each bubble once contained a lamellar onion droplet suspended in the @xmath1 phase . on raising the temperature , the central region melts and we observe changes in the birefringence of the bubble",
    ".    eventually the bubble rapidly shrinks down into a small lamellar droplet ( figure  [ burst ] ) . in some cases",
    "we observe the bubble to rapidly collapse and then completely vanish after it bursts .",
    "the kinetic behaviour of such processes remains to be fully investigated .",
    "temperature quench experiments in surfactant systems have led to a variety of interesting observations . in the initial stages after the temperature quench , disruption of the @xmath1 phase occurs and @xmath2 droplets are found to move from the @xmath0 through the @xmath1 to the @xmath2 phase .",
    "this is attributed to a sudden reduction in the bilayer concentration which causes the @xmath1 and @xmath0 phase to expel solvent forming a ` sponge emulsion ' , and a suspension of @xmath2 droplets , respectively .",
    "this is only observed in the first few hours after the quench . after this rapid equilibration of the bilayer concentration",
    ", we observe the formation of lamellar droplets in the sponge phase close to the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface .",
    "this observation can be explained in terms of the evolution through a free energy landscape .",
    "as the system proceeds to equilibrium it goes through a series of metastable states . under such conditions",
    "the bilayer concentration at the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface can be larger than at the @xmath0/@xmath1 interface . in this case",
    "the sponge phase is more likely to nucleate lamellar phase droplets close to the micellar / sponge interface .",
    "however until we can directly probe the density of the sponge phase as a function of sample height during this process this explanation remains speculative , and the inverted density profile of figure  [ phipro ] remains a conjecture .    at a later stage",
    "we observe a plume to form at the @xmath2/@xmath1 interface which connects up to the @xmath0 phase .",
    "this may be due to the nucleation of lamellar phase droplets in the micellar phase , @xmath2 which get ` stuck ' when they reach the sponge phase interface .",
    "if the surface tension of the @xmath0/@xmath1 interface is large then the lamellar phase will build up until there is enough to break through .",
    "the break through is driven by gravity as in a lava - lamp .    in two - phase samples which were prepared at a larger bilayer concentration",
    "we have observed different features .",
    "the absence of the third phase ( @xmath2 ) means we do not observe the nucleation at the bottom of the cell or the formation of the plume .",
    "this gives weight to the free - energy landscape explanation of the nucleation kinetics .",
