    "quantum critical phenomena is the study of how a system loses long range order at @xmath8 as a parameter of the hamiltonian is changed  @xcite .",
    "the non - commutativity of position and momentum in quantum mechanics implies that the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the order parameter are coupled to each other at the zero temperature quantum critical point .",
    "the effect of temperature on a quantum critical point has some generic features  @xcite such as , a non - zero temperature produces dephasing or decoherence that cuts off divergences in correlation lengths and times .",
    "thermal decoherence also decouples spatial and temporal fluctuations causing a crossover from quantum to classical behavior .",
    "while quantum phase transitions for systems in equilibrium have been extensively studied , a much less understood issue is the effect of a nonequilibrium probe such as current flow on a system in the vicinity of a quantum critical point .",
    "scaling theories exist which assume that the primary effect of a nonequilibrium probe is to produce decoherence or an effective temperature . thus nonequilibrium",
    "scaling relations are obtained by replacing temperature in the equilibrium scaling relations by the appropriate nonequilibrium energy scale  @xcite . a microscopic treatment to justify this and in the process also identify the appropriate nonequilibrium energy scale is often challenging as this requires a treatment that goes beyond a linear response kubo formula calculation .",
    "only a handful of such treatments exist for magnetic - paramagnetic  @xcite , and superfluid - insulator / metal quantum critical points  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we revisit the problem of non - linear effects , in particular the effect of a uniform current flow on a system near a superconductor - metal quantum critical point .",
    "existing studies have so far involved writing phenomenological effective theories for a charged order - parameter in the presence of an electric field and/or external dissipation  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we carry out a fully microscopic derivation of the appropriate nonequilibrium effective theory starting from a fermionic model under external drive . in doing so",
    ", we address the issue of how the fermionic system reaches a nonequilibrium steady state , and find that the underlying nonequilibrium fermions give rise to additional terms in the effective theory for the charged order - parameter that were previously missed .",
    "we then proceed to determine the effect of these terms on scaling near the equilibrium quantum critical point .",
    "( note that the observation that nonequilibrium electrons can significantly modify the scaling near critical points was also pointed out in  @xcite , and was experimentally observed in thin films of bi in  @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry that will be studied ( shown schematically in fig  [ schem ] ) is a 2d itinerant electron system where the electrons interact with each other via an attractive interaction .",
    "this system is driven out of equilibrium by an in - plane electric field so that a current flows through the bulk of the system .",
    "in addition , the 2d layer is coupled to an underlying normal metal substrate with which it can exchange particle as well as energy which thus serves as a heat sink that allows the layer to reach a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "the coupling to the substrate also provides a source of dissipation that when made sufficiently large can destroy superconductivity in the layer  @xcite .",
    "( note that the model in fig  [ schem ] for the case of repulsive interactions of the electrons in the layer and for parameters that are such that the system is near a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic quantum critical point was studied in  @xcite ) .    as we shall show , in equilibrium the effective action for the superconducting fluctuations on the ordered and the disordered side has a local caldiera - leggett dissipation typical of systems where particle number is not conserved  @xcite .",
    "effective theories for superconducting fluctuations with local dissipation have been extensively studied in equilibrium ,  @xcite , but hardly at all out of equilibrium ( with the exception of  @xcite ) . out of equilibrium ,",
    "our microscopic treatment reveals three effects of current flow , one is the usual minimal coupling of the current to the charged order - parameter , second is a source of noise which for low frequencies and long wavelength fluctuations of the order - parameter essentially acts as an effective temperature which equals the typical energy an electron gains on being accelerated by the external electric field . in our model @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath3 are the charge and fermi velocity of the electrons , and",
    "@xmath4 is the inelastic scattering time or escape time into the normal metal reservoirs .",
    "thirdly , we also find that current flow can cause the order - parameter to drift with a drift velocity @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the mass of the electrons .",
    "we briefly mention the relation of the work presented here to that of  @xcite which also had an extrinsic dissipation which was introduced phenomenologically .",
    "thus in their model , current affects the order - parameter only via its minimal coupling to it , and the properties of the dissipative reservoir were unaffected by the current flow . in our model , the dissipation originates via the coupling of the superconducting order - parameter to the underlying normal electrons , whose properties are itself modified due to an external drive . taking this effect into account shows that the order - parameter is subjected to a noise and also drifts with the current . as we shall show , in the quantum - critical regime , current noise gives corrections to the scaling which are of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the ratio of the typical energy gained from the electric field between collisions , and the energy lost due to inelastic scattering .",
    "since , in our model @xmath4 is largely independent of the electric field ( it may acquire some corrections at large electric fields ) , the corrections to scaling due to noise ( @xmath15 ) is subdominant in the quantum critical regime , with the dominant scaling behavior being that derived in  @xcite . in the quantum disordered regime",
    "however , direct coupling and noise effects are found to be equally important .",
    "current drift on the other hand gives a correction which is smaller by an additional factor of @xmath16 where @xmath7 is the fermi energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the model is presented in section  [ model ] and is treated within a keldysh path integral approach which will allow us to study out - of - equilibrium effects .",
    "we first study the equilibrium properties of the system by performing a mean - field treatment in section  [ mfeq ] which reveals a dissipation induced quantum critical point , which can also be understood as a proximity effect .",
    "a derivation of the effective action for the superconducting fluctuations about the equilibrium ordered side is presented in appendix  [ flucord ] , and the origin of a local caldiera - leggett dissipation arising due to nonconserved particle number is highlighted .",
    "fluctuation about the nonequilibrium disordered state is studied in section  [ neqfluc ] and the new terms in the bosonic theory corresponding to current noise and drift are derived . scaling equations for the gap and the current",
    "are derived in section  [ scaling ] .",
    "many of the details of the derivation have been relegated to the appendices .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ concl ] where we discuss our results in the context of existing experiments .",
    "we consider a model of electrons in a @xmath17d layer that interact via a short ranged attractive interaction responsible for a superconducting instability and are coupled via tunneling to a reservoir of non - interacting electrons .",
