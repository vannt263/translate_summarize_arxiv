    "we give a systematic construction of finite element exact sequences with a commuting diagram property for the de rham complex in one- , two- and three - dimensional domains .",
    "the construction of these commuting exact sequences for the three - dimensional case relies on the construction of commuting exact sequences for the two dimensional case , which in turn relies on the construction of commuting exact sequences in one - space dimension . for each dimension ,",
    "the construction is carried out on a single element @xmath0 in such way that proper continuity properties hold which guarantee that the commutativity of the diagram holds when @xmath0 is replaced by the triangulation of the domain @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in two dimensions , the elements @xmath0 can be polygons of arbitrary shape , and in three - dimensions , polyhedra of arbitrary shape .    roughly speaking , by a commuting exact sequence on a polyhedral domain @xmath1 in @xmath3 , we mean that , the mappings in the diagram @xmath4 commute in the sense that @xmath5 the importance of commuting exact sequences , for the devising of stable finite element methods , has been amply discussed in @xcite and the references therein .",
    "most of the previous work on the construction of commuting exact sequences ( in three - space dimensions ) focuses on the explicit construction of shape functions on one of four particular _ reference _ polyhedra , namely , the reference tetrahedron , hexahedron ( cube ) , prism , and pyramid .",
    "see @xcite for sequences on the reference tetrahedron and reference hexahedron , @xcite on the reference hexahedron , @xcite on the reference prism , and @xcite on the reference pyramid .",
    "all of these spaces in these sequences are spanned by polynomial shape functions , except those in @xcite which also contain rational shape functions .",
    "currently , there are two ways of constructing commuting exact sequences on general polyhedral meshes .",
    "the first is provided by the _ virtual element methods _ ( vem )",
    "these methods define the basis functions of their local spaces on each polyhedral element in terms of solutions to certain partial differential equations.the explicit form of these basis functions , usually not computable , is _ not _ needed by the methods , but a set of _ unisolvent _ degrees of freedom which can be used to _ exactly _ compute integrals related to the polynomial parts of the basis functions needs be constructed . in our construction , we avoid basis functions defined as solutions to certain partial differential equations .",
    "the second way is provided by the so - called _ finite element system _ ( fes ) developed in ; see also @xcite .",
    "therein , the notion of a _",
    "compatible _ fes was introduced , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 5.12 ) , which was then proven to the existence of a commuting diagram , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.44 ) .",
    "the construction of a fes with a commuting diagram was thus reduced to the construction of a compatible fes .",
    "furthermore , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.2 ) , a criterion for finding a compatible fes , containing certain prescribed functions , with the _ smallest _ possible dimension was presented given thus rise to the concept of a _ minimal compatible fes _ ( mcfes ) .",
    "although a simple dimension count equation in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.2 ) can be used to check whether a compatible fes is minimal or not , a practical construction of an mcfes was not provided in @xcite .",
    "we develop a systematic construction of commuting exact sequences on a general polytope in , and then ( in three - space dimensions ) apply the construction to each of the above - mentioned four reference polyhedra to discover and rediscover concrete examples of commuting exact sequences . in particular , we show that all the results in @xcite on a tetrahedron , cube , and prism fit nicely within our construction .",
    "moreover , a significant dimension reduction is obtained on the pyramidal commuting exact sequence in comparison with the exact sequence proposed in @xcite . for a general polyhedron ,",
    "our construction of of high - order commuting exact sequences is significantly more difficult than that of the cases already mentioned .",
    "it will be carried out elsewhere .",
    "let us now roughly describe the main steps of the systematic construction in three - dimensions .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we pick @xmath0 to be a specific polyhedron .",
    "then , we take the set of commuting exact sequences on the faces of @xmath0 , @xmath6 each of the commuting exact sequences    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we present two commuting exact sequences on the reference tetrahedron and four on the reference hexahedron , prism , and pyramid .",
    "all these commuting exact sequences are the _ smallest _ ones , as described in theorem [ thm:3d - general ] , which contain certain given exact sequence and have a certain prescribed sequence of traces on each face .",
    "we then obtain commuting exact sequences on polyhedral meshes made of mapped tetrahedra hexahedra , prisms , and pyramids .",
