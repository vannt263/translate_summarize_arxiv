    "the upcoming rhic experiments will reproduce the extreme conditions that existed in the early universe and it is hoped that the predicted qcd phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma will be observed .",
    "the non - perturbative nature of these phenomena makes precise theoretical predictions difficult .",
    "lattice gauge theory provides a first - principles approach to qcd thermodynamics and , in principle , a way to perform precise non - perturbative calculations of thermodynamic quantities at equilibrium .",
    "quantities such as the value of the critical temperature , the width of the critical region and the order of the transition can then be used by phenomenological models to make contact with experiment . while great progress has been made since the inception of the lattice regulator 25 years ago @xcite there remain very significant uncertainties that prevent these calculations from being viewed as unambiguous predictions of qcd . since these calculations are computer simulations one could think that progress in this field is tied with progress in computer speeds .",
    "while this is partially true , it is not the real culprit especially given the fast growth in computer speeds during this period .",
    "the true reason lies at the most simple and fundamental level of the lattice theory .    when the first derivative of the fermion kinetic energy term is made into a lattice difference operator the number of light species multiplies by a factor of @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimension of space  time",
    "this is the well known doubling problem and it turns out that at non  zero lattice spacing in order to remove the extra species and still have a local lagrangian one has to compromise the global flavor chiral symmetries of the theory @xcite .",
    "there are two popular methods to put fermions on the lattice : wilson and staggered fermions .",
    "both of these methods at finite lattice spacing @xmath5 break the chiral symmetry .",
    "the chiral symmetry is recovered together with the lorentz symmetry as the continuum limit @xmath6 is taken . and here lies the problem . in a numerical simulation",
    "a decrease of the lattice spacing by a factor of @xmath7 requires an increase in computation by a factor of @xmath8 depending on the parameters . in order to control the amount of chiral symmetry breaking induced by the regulator prohibitively large computing resources are required .",
    "clearly faster computers although one day may be able to overcome these large factors can not be the answer .    a way out of this forbidding state of affairs came from d. kaplan@xcite through an unexpected avenue .",
    "he formulated a new fermion lattice regulator with the name domain wall fermions ( dwf ) .",
    "the first numerical simulations using dwf in vector gauge theories were done in @xcite and were followed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    "the latest results from simulations of dynamical qcd thermodynamics are presented .",
    "preliminary results of this work have already appeared in @xcite , @xcite . for promising alternatives to domain wall fermion simulations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "domain wall fermions introduce an extra direction of space  time with size @xmath9 .",
    "the fermion fields are five - dimensional while the gauge fields remain four - dimensional and couple the same way to all extra fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "the boundary conditions along the fifth direction are free ( domain wall ) and although the extra fermion degrees of freedom are heavy a light dirac fermion surface mode develops on the boundaries with its positive chiral components exponentially bound on one wall and its negative components on the other . in the @xmath10",
    "limit the mode is a massless dirac fermion . at finite @xmath9 the residual",
    "mixing introduces an exponentially small mass .",
    "since these properties are maintained at any lattice spacing dwf provide a way of separating the recovery of the chiral symmetry from the recovery of the lorentz symmetry .",
    "now at a fixed lattice spacing the chiral symmetry can be recovered by increasing @xmath9 . unlike wilson or staggered fermions",
    "the computing cost in recovery of the chiral symmetry is only linear in @xmath9 !",
    "these remarkable properties may bring within reach physically realistic studies of lattice qcd thermodynamics .",
    "the subject of dwf has a large volume of work behind it .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and references therein for an introduction . here , the version of dwf as presented in @xcite with the modifications in @xcite is used .",
    "the theory has five parameters : the four - dimensional lattice volume @xmath11 , the inverse gauge coupling squared @xmath12 , a bare mass that explicitly mixes the two chiralities bound on the domain walls @xmath13 , the number of sites of the fifth direction @xmath9 , and a five - dimensional mass that can be thought of as the domain wall height @xmath14 .",
    "the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath9 and @xmath14 set the bare quark mass .",
    "in free theory the bare quark mass @xmath15 is given by @xcite : @xmath16 , \\ \\ \\ \\ 0 < m_0 < 2   \\label{meff_free}\\ ] ]    there are many important theoretical issues regarding dwf",
    ". perhaps the most crucial one relates to the localization of the chiral modes in the interacting theory .",
    "does the localization remain exponential as in free theory or does it become power law ?",
    "how does the decay rate depend on the lattice spacing ?",
    "these questions were addressed in detail in @xcite in the context of the two flavor schwinger model .",
    "there it was found that the decay is exponential and that the decay rate becomes faster as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "the last result can be understood by a simple examination of eq .",
    "[ meff_free ] . in the interacting theory",
    "@xmath14 will be renormalized and therefore optimum localization will be shifted away from @xmath17 .",
    "however , even if @xmath14 is adjusted to absorb this renormalization , optimal decay will not be possible since the optimal value for @xmath14 will fluctuate from one background gauge field to the next . at strong coupling were the gauge field fluctuations are large the corresponding fluctuations in the optimal value of @xmath14 will also be large and the decay rate will become slow . this scenario is reminiscent of the way the bare mass of wilson type fermions is used to cancel the renormalization of the interacting theory .",
    "however , because the massless point changes from configuration to configuration masslesssness can only be achieved up to order of the lattice spacing . here",
    "the same is true but the fluctuations in mass are raised to the @xmath9 power and therefore can be de - amplified by any amount for large enough @xmath9 .",
    "there is another related source of de - localizing effects .",
    "it has been shown that the transfer matrix along the extra direction for certain gauge field configurations can develop unit eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "for such configurations the surface states completely de - localize .",
    "although , the set of such configurations is of zero measure , configurations in their vicinity will produce poor localization .",
    "these configurations are special to the lattice since they allow the passage from one topological sector to another . again , as the continuum limit is approached these configurations will have a negligible boltzmann weight and their de - localizing effects will diminish .",
    "another issue relates to the positivity of the transfer matrix along the fifth direction .",
    "details regarding this can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", it suffices to mention that if @xmath9 is kept even and if all green s functions are extracted from sites along the fifth direction that have a distance from the boundaries of an even number of sites the relevant transfer matrix is the square of the single step one and is therefore positive .",
    "finally the number of light flavors of the free theory depends on @xmath14 .",
    "for example if @xmath18 the theory has one light flavor but if @xmath19 the theory has four light flavors .",
    "these @xmath14 ranges are modified in the interacting theory and one should make sure that the needed number of flavors is produced @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the two flavor schwinger model was simulated numerically in @xcite .",
    "if the chiral symmetries of the massless model are intact , the chiral condensate will have a zero vacuum expectation value , @xmath20 at all couplings .",
    "therefore , the deviation of @xmath21 from zero can serve as a measure of the amount of chiral symmetry breaking induced by the regulator . in figure [ fig_1 ]",
    "the results from these simulations are presented .",
    "-1.5 cm    2.6 truein    -.2 cm    there are three observations that can be made from this figure : 1 ) for each lattice spacing there are two different decay rates . in @xcite the fast rate was related to the physics of the zero topological sector while the slow rate was related to the physics of topology changing configurations .",
    "2 ) fits to an exponential decay form @xmath22 have @xmath23 per degree of freedom around one indicating that the localization of the light states in the interacting theory is consistent with exponential decay .",
    "also , power law behavior can be excluded with some confidence for the @xmath24 data since a power law fit has a @xmath23 per degree of freedom of @xmath25 .",
    "3 ) the decay rates become faster as the lattice spacing is decreased .",
    "this is a key feature that makes dwf a viable lattice fermion regulator .",
    "before dwf can be used in qcd an analysis similar to the one for the scwhwinger model must be done in order to map the parameter space . below the results from such",
    "an analysis using quenched qcd are presented .",
    "preliminary results can be found in @xcite , @xcite .    as mentioned in section [ sec_dwf ]",
    "@xmath14 controls the number of light flavors .",
    "since this parameter is renormalized , it is important to understand which ranges correspond to different flavor sectors . in figure [ fig_2]a @xmath21 is plotted as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "three regions can be distinguished : @xmath21 is zero for @xmath26 , it has a value around @xmath27 for @xmath28 while it has a value that is four times larger for @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , these three regions correspond to a zero , two and eight flavor theory ( for algorithmic reasons only an even number of flavors is simulated ; had it not been for this restriction the three regions would correspond to zero , one and four flavors ) .    in order to investigate the @xmath9 dependence of the theory the pion mass @xmath30 is measured for several values of @xmath13 at fixed @xmath9 and @xmath14 for @xmath31 on an @xmath32 lattice .",
    "its value is then extrapolated to zero quark mass .",
    "this exercise is repeated for several values of @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath33 extrapolated value as a function of @xmath9 is shown if figure [ fig_2]b for @xmath34 .",
    "the solid line is a fit to @xmath35 .",
    "the fit has @xmath36 indicating that the localization is consistent with exponential decay .",
    "the constant part of the fit is due to finite volume . on a finite box of size @xmath37 and periodic boundary conditions",
    "the longest correlation length is @xmath38 and therefore the smallest mass should be @xmath39 . in this case",
    "@xmath40 . that this is indeed a finite volume effect",
    "was supported by a second simulation on a @xmath41 lattice .",
    "-0.5 cm    4.4 truein    -2.0 truein    finally , the rho and nucleon masses were measured for several @xmath13 and @xmath9 .",
    "their @xmath33 extrapolated values showed almost no dependence on @xmath9 for @xmath42 .",
    "the nucleon to rho mass ratio was found to be @xmath43 to be compared with the physical value @xmath44 .",
    "the discrepancy is expected since the lattice spacing is rather large , @xmath45 , and the box size only marginally large @xmath46 .",
    "given the modest volume size these results compare favorably with previous quenched qcd results using wilson and staggered fermions at larger volumes .",
    "with this ground work in hand dynamical qcd thermodynamics can be investigated . the first exploratory work is done on small lattices of size @xmath47 .",
    "preliminary results have been presented in @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig_3]a @xmath48 as a function of @xmath12 is shown for a fixed @xmath9 and @xmath13 at @xmath49 .",
    "a rapid crossover is observed indicating the presence of a phase transition . to confirm that indeed there are two phases @xmath48 is plotted in figure [ fig_3]b as a function of @xmath13 at @xmath50 for @xmath51 below the transition and @xmath52 above . clearly below the transition @xmath48 extrapolates to a non zero value indicating spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 chiral symmetry down to @xmath53 flavor . because the langrangian is explicitly symmetric under the @xmath53 flavor there are three degenerate goldstone pions . above the transition @xmath48 extrapolates to a non zero but very small value ( which could be further reduced by increasing @xmath9 ) indicating that the full @xmath1 chiral symmetry is essentially restored .",
    "this illustrates the unique properties of dwf .",
    "to further study the properties of the dynamical theory @xmath54 is plotted as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath55 , @xmath49 both below ( @xmath51 ) and above ( @xmath52 ) the transition in figure [ fig_4]a .",
    "the fits are of the form @xmath56 .",
    "the constant term is the value of the condensate at the non - zero mass @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath57 is small indicating that the localization of the dynamical theory is consistent with exponential .",
    "as seen in the schwinger model the decay rate becomes faster as the lattice spacing is made smaller ( increasing @xmath12 ) . at @xmath52 the @xmath58 value of @xmath48",
    "is already approached to within a few percent at @xmath50 while at @xmath51 a larger @xmath9 is needed .",
    "although these results are encouraging it must be stressed out that at this large lattice spacing other observables may have different decay characteristics .",
    "finally it is important to investigate the behavior of the phase transition as a function of @xmath14 . in figure [ fig_4]b",
    "the wilson line is shown as a function of @xmath12 for various @xmath14 .",
    "a similar plot has also been obtained for @xmath48 but because the wavefunction renormalization of the fermion field depends on @xmath14 , it is hard to display in a single figure . from left to right the figure corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "the qualitative features of these curves are similar but the critical value of @xmath12 is a strong function of @xmath14 .",
    "this is not surprising since @xmath12 is a bare parameter .",
    "one observes that as @xmath14 is reduced the critical @xmath12 approaches the quenched value @xmath60 indicating that the regime of zero flavors is approached .",
    "the role of @xmath14 in thermodynamics should be studied with some caution .",
    "for example , from free field studies the range of small momenta accessible to the light flavor is restricted if @xmath14 is set close to its lower bound for one flavor physics .",
    "similar effects can occur if @xmath14 is set close to its upper bound for one flavor physics .",
    "since such a restriction may affect the thermodynamics one should set @xmath14 somewhere in the middle of the allowed range .    -0.5 cm    4.4 truein    -2.0 truein",
    "-0.5 cm    4.4 truein    -2.0 truein",
    "if the @xmath2 symmetry above but close to the deconfining phase transition is broken the transition is expected to be second order while if it is not broken or only softly broken the transition may be first order @xcite .",
    "this important issue can be investigated by direct lattice qcd simulations just above the transition .",
    "using staggered fermions @xcite it was not possible to draw unequivocal conclusions mainly because staggered fermions may not produce the zero mode effects necessary for anomalous breaking of @xmath2 @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand dwf are known to posses exact and robust zero modes in the @xmath58 limit @xcite . in @xcite it was shown that for classical instanton backgrounds these properties are maintained with high accuracy even at finite @xmath61 . in order to confirm the presence of zero modes in a situation with quantum fluctuations @xmath48 versus @xmath13 from a numerical simulation of quenched qcd just above the transition",
    "is plotted in figure [ fig_5]a . since in the quenched approximation",

    "the difference @xmath63 of the screening masses of the delta and pion particles is used as a measure of anomalous symmetry breaking .",
    "the screening masses are measured from the exponential fall - off of the relevant two point green s function along a spatial direction .",
    "since the delta and pion green s function are related by a @xmath2 transformation @xmath63 should be zero in the zero mass limit if the symmetry is not broken and non - zero otherwise . in figure",
