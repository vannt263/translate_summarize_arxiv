    "one of the most interesting areas in the study of general relativity and astrophysics is the end states of gravitational collapse of massive stars .",
    "once a massive star has exhausted its thermonuclear source of energy , it begins its endless gravitational collapse .",
    "interest in the outcome of this collapse started in 1939 , when oppenheimer and snyder @xcite considered a spherically symmetric dust cloud which underwent continued collapse .",
    "the first exact solution to the einstein field equations was presented by karl schwarzschild in 1916 @xcite which described the exterior gravitational field of a static sphere .",
    "schwarzschild then presented the solution describing the gravitational field for the interior of a static spherically symmetric star , where the matter was assumed to be a perfect fluid with constant density . in 1951",
    "vaidya derived the first exact solution for the exterior gravitational field of a spherically symmetric radiating object @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the junction conditions for the interior of a shear - free radiating star were derived by santos in 1985 @xcite ; and various models of radiating stars could then be studied .",
    "hundreds of solutions incorporating shear , pressure anisotropy , charge , and several matter distributions have been found since then @xcite .",
    "general relativity inherently admits the existence of spacetime singularities , which are extreme regions in spacetime where densities and spacetime curvatures diverge and the theory must break down . the cosmic censorship conjecture proposed by penrose @xcite in 1969 ,",
    "states that any reasonable matter configuration undergoing continued gravitational collapse will always form a black hole .",
    "joshi @xcite in 2002 assessed the situation due to several models that proposed naked singularities as the final outcome of collapse .",
    "a singularity being naked implies that there exist families of future directed non - spacelike curves , which in the past terminate at the singularity .",
    "no such families exist when the collapse ends in a black hole . for black hole formation , the resultant spacetime singularity is hidden inside an event horizon of gravity , remaining unseen by external observers . for naked singularity formation",
    ", however , there is a causal connection between the region of singularity and distant observers , thus enabling communication from the superdense regions close to the singularity to distant observers .",
    "joshi @xcite listed the physical conditions that could support the cosmic censorship conjecture and prevent the formation of a naked singularity as the end state of gravitational collapse .",
    "the conditions are : ( i ) a suitable energy condition must be obeyed , ( ii ) the collapse must develop from regular initial data , ( iii ) singularities from realistic collapse must be gravitationally strong ( divergence of all important physical quantities such as pressure , density , curvature , etc . ) , ( iv ) the matter fields must be sufficiently general , ( v ) a realistic equation of state must be obeyed , ( vi ) all radiations from naked singularity must be infinitely red - shifted .",
    "hence the final outcome of stellar gravitational collapse is still very much open to debate , primarily due to models that admit naked singularities @xcite @xcite . for the interior of the star , forms of the energy momentum tensor , ranging from a perfect fluid to an imperfect fluid with heat flux and anisotropic pressure",
    "have been investigated @xcite .",
    "it is well known that when a reasonable matter distribution undergoes gravitational collapse , in the absence of shear or with homogeneous density , the end result is a black hole .",
    "shear has been identified as the factor that delays the formation of the apparent horizon , by making the final stages of collapse incoherent thereby leading to the generation of naked singularities @xcite .",
    "wagh and govinder @xcite showed that all known naked singularities in spherically symmetric self - similar spacetimes arise as a result of singular initial matter distributions .",
    "this is a result of the peculiarity of the coordinate transformation that takes these spacetimes into a separable form .",
    "such examples of naked singularities are therefore of no apparent consequence to astrophysics . an interesting collapse scenario without the formation of horizon",
    "was presented by banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite where it was demonstrated that the non - occurrence of a horizon is due to the fact that the rate of mass loss is exactly counterbalanced by the fall of boundary radius .",
    "this model was extended to higher dimensions by banerjee and chaterjee who showed that the dimensionality of spacetime plays a key role in the temporal evolution of the collapsing sphere @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to incorporate radiation into the florides @xcite solution and investigate the influence of the vanishing radial pressure in the initially static model on the thermal behaviour of the collapsing star . in order to determine the influence of the initial conditions of the static configuration we utilise the wyman solution @xcite which describes a uniform density sphere with nonvanishing radial pressure .",
    "we compare the thermal behaviour of both collapsing models which had as their initial static cores described by the wyman and florides solutions .",
    "the dynamical evolution of these models is obtained by allowing one of the constants in the static solution to be time dependent .",
    "this approach was used previously by kramer @xcite to model a collapsing schwarzschild - like radiating sphere .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we present the general framework which allows us to model an initially static sphere which undergoes dissipative gravitational collapse in the form of a radial heat flux .",
    "the wyman solution which is the interior schwarzschild solution in isotropic coordinates is introduced in section 3 . the florides solution which describes a spherically symmetric ,",
    "static matter distribution with vanishing radial pressure is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the thermodynamics of the collapsing models is presented in section 5 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in section 6 .",
    "the interior spacetime of our radiating stellar model is described by a spherically symmetric shear - free line element in simultaneously comoving and isotropic coordinates of the form @xmath0 , \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 encodes the dynamical nature of the model and the functions @xmath3 describe a static fluid solution of the einstein field equations in isotropic coordinates .",

    "@xcite the particles in einstein s model move in circular orbits with the only influence being gravity .",
    "the other simplifications are that there is no radiation emitted by the particles and the orbits of the particles are non - overlapping ( there are no particle interactions , per se ) . though the initial model was crude , it served a purpose : it was an easy to imagine a cluster with some physical properties and did not exhibit any singularities .",
    "einstein showed that equilibrium is still achievable with vanishing pressure , by making use of rotation to balance the gravitational force .",
    "the florides solution @xcite describes a field with vanishing radial pressure but nonzero tangential pressure , and may thus be interpreted as the field inside an einstein cluster .",

    "this is different for the dynamical wyman model where ( [ a5 ] ) only holds at the boundary of the star . figure 4 .",
    "shows that the density starts off at a high value at the stellar center and decreases monotonically outwards towards the surface .",
    "the radial pressure is a monotonically decreasing function of the radial coordinate @xmath41 as shown in figure 5 .",
    "the behaviour exhibited by the energy density and radial pressure supports the characteristics of a hot core dissipating energy to the exterior via a radial heat flux .",
    "the anisotropy factor is positive ( figure 6 . ) , indicative of repulsion within the core .",
    "this repulsion can slow down the collapse rate .",
    "heat flow in relativistic astrophysics has been widely studied within the context of extended irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "various studies have demonstrated that relaxational effects lead to higher core temperatures during dissipative collapse . in order to distinguish between the two initially static models we make use of a truncated causal heat transport equation of maxwell - cattaneo form@xcite @xmath80 where we have assumed no viscous - heat coupling of the thermodynamical fluxes .",
    "the truncated causal heat transport equation addresses several of the pathologies that are intrinsic to the eckart transport equation .",
    "however , the truncation implies disregarding nonlinear terms which may be significant at higher temperatures or during the latter stages of collapse@xcite .",
    "we are able to calculate the causal temperature profiles for both the wyman and florides models for the case of constant collision time by adopting a power - law dependence for the thermal conductivity and relaxation time : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants .",
    "we also assume that the relaxation time is directly proportional to the mean collision time @xmath85 where @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is a constant .",
    "figures 7 . and 8 . clearly show that the casual temperature is greater than the eckart temperature within the fluid distribution for the respective models .",
    "furthermore , cooling is enhanced at the surface layers where heat generation is much lower compared to the central dense regions of the star .",
    "figure 7 . highlights an interesting observation regarding the eckart temperature distribution of the wyman model ( solid line ) and florides model ( dashed line ) .",
    "the eckart temperature for the wyman model is lower than its counterpart for the florides model .",
    "this is true for each interior point of the respective models .",
    "the same conclusions hold true for the causal temperature profiles ( figure 8 . ) .",
    "this behaviour in the temperature profile is expected as the nonzero radial pressure present in the wyman model slows down the collapse thus hindering heat generation within the core .",
    "the interplay between the tangential pressure and radial pressure in the wyman model results in a high anisotropy factor which is responsible for a repulsion effect within the stellar core .",
    "this repulsion slows down the collapse leading to lower heat generation .",
    "the anisotropy factor in the florides model is three orders of magnitude smaller than that in the wyman model .",
    "the repulsion is significantly smaller thus allowing for a more efficient collapse and larger heat dissipation throughout the core .",
    "we have utilised two initially static matter distributions to model dissipative collapse .",
    "both models start off with initially static cores of uniform density , same initial mass and initial radii , the crucial difference being that the florides model has vanishing radial pressure at each interior point of the stellar configuration while the wyman solution has a nonzero radial pressure throughout the stellar interior .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence of the radial pressure does not affect the time of formation of the horizon which depends only on the initial mass and radius of the initial static configuration . also worth mentioning",
    "is the effect of the radial pressure on the temperature profiles in both the causal and noncausal theories . the radial pressure ( through the anisotropy parameter )",
    "slows down the collapse rate thus reducing the amount of heat being generated within the core .",
    "this results in a lower core temperature when radial pressure is present . by employing a truncated causal heat transport equation we showed that the presence of the initial radial pressure within the static core is further enhanced by relaxational effects .",
    "we believe that this is the first time that such an effect on the temperature profile of the collapsing body has been demonstrated when the collapse proceeds from an initially static configuration .",
    "this investigation highlights the importance of the initial conditions during gravitational collapse .",
