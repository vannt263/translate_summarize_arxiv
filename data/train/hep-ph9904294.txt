    "one of the most remarkable and intriguing discoveries in hadron physics in the last years was the observation of hard interactions ( namely , partonic activity ) in diffractive events by the ua8 collaboration @xcite at the cern collider .",
    "this discovery was inspired by a seminal paper by ingelman and schlein @xcite in which such a possibility was foreseen as a consequence of the pomeron having an internal structure and a quark / gluon content .",
    "experiments performed at hera by zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite collaborations provided further elements to this view through the obtainment of deep inelastic electron - proton scattering ( dis ) events accompanied by large rapidity gaps adjacent to the proton beam direction .",
    "the presence of rapidity gaps in such events is interpreted as indicative that the internal structure of a colourless object carrying the vaccum quantum numbers , namely the pomeron , is being probed @xcite .",
    "further experimental evidences of hard diffraction have been reported by cdf and d0 collaborations in terms of diffractive production of w s and dijets @xcite .",
    "taking together , these evidences seem to indicate that the ingelman - schlein ( is ) picture @xcite is right at least _",
    "qualitatively_. however , a serious problem arises when one checks this model quantitatively .",
    "for instance , the model predictions systematically overestimate the diffractive production rates of jets and w s @xcite .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the discrepancy between predictions and data comes from the so - called _ pomeron flux factor _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , a recent analysis @xcite has shown that the pomeron structure function extracted from hera data by using the is approach is strongly dependent on which expression is used for the flux factor .",
    "recently , new data from h1 collaboration  @xcite on final hadronic states in diffractive deep inelastic process ( ddis ) of the type @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are hadronic systems , have been presented .",
    "the system @xmath3 and @xmath4 in ( [ i ] ) are separated by the largest rapidity gap .",
    "@xmath4 is the closest to the proton beem ( @xmath5 gev ) and squared momentum transfer at the @xmath6 vertex , @xmath7 , is limited to @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "both invariant masses , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are small compared to @xmath13 , the centre - of - mass energy of the @xmath14 system .    in particular , charged hadron multiplicity",
    "have been studied in  @xcite as a function of @xmath11 in the centre  of  mass system of @xmath3 .",
    "the data obtained have been compared with the calculations of jetset @xmath0 ( which is known to reproduce well the @xmath0 data ) and with the data on hadron multiplicities in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "the interesting observations presented in  @xcite are the following : i ) for @xmath15 gev @xmath16 is larger than charged hadron multiplicity in dis , @xmath17 , at comparable values of @xmath18 ; ii ) @xmath16 is also larger than charged hadron multiplicity in @xmath0 annihilation , @xmath19 , taken at @xmath20 .    in the present paper we demonstrate that perturbative qcd is able to explain ( qualitatively and quantitavely ) the more rapid growth of hadron multiplicity in ddis .",
    "so , no mechanisms besides gluon / quark jet emission with subsequent jet fragmentation into hadrons are needed .",
    "it is shown that the results on hadron multiplicity are very sensitive to the quark - gluon structure of the pomeron .",
    "an advantage of the method developed here is that it does not depend on the pomeron flux factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the qcd formalism for the description of final hadron states in ordinary dis . in section iii , we extend this formalism to diffractive dis and apply it to describe the h1 data .",
    "our main conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "for the time being , we can not describe a transition of quark and gluons into hadrons in the framework of qcd .",
    "nevertheless , perturbative qcd enables one to calculate an energy dependence of characteristics of final hadrons produced in hard process ( @xmath0 annihilation into hadrons , dis , drell  yan process etc . ) .",
    "mean hadron multiplicity , @xmath21 , is one of the main features of final hadronic states .",
    "hadron multiplicity in @xmath0 annihilation has been studied in a number of papers .",
    "the result looks like ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a total c.m.s .",
    "energy of colliding leptons .",
    "as one can see , @xmath19 rises more rapidly than @xmath24 , although more slowly than any power of @xmath25 .",
    "expression  ( [ 2.1 ] ) describes well the available data .",
    "hadron multiplicity in dis was calculated first in the framework of perturbative qcd in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that average multiplicity in lepton scattering off parton @xmath26 @xmath27 , is related to @xmath28 , the average multiplicity in @xmath0 annihilation , taken at @xmath29 ( up to small nlo corrections which descrease in @xmath13 and @xmath30 )  @xcite .    in a case when quark distribution dominates ( say , at @xmath31 ) , the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 looks like ( up to small nlo corrections which decrease in @xmath13 and @xmath30 )  @xcite @xmath34    if we consider small @xmath35 , we have to account for the gluon distribution and the result is of the following form  @xcite @xmath36 , \\label{2.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a number of colours .    the quantity @xmath40 is defined via gluon distribution ( see  @xcite for details ) @xmath41 @xmath42 being the qcd  evolution parameter @xmath43 .",
    "let us notice that @xmath40  ( [ 2.5 ] ) does not depend on a type of a target , and @xmath40 is completely defined by the evolution of @xmath44 in @xmath42 .",
    "starting from the well  known expression for @xmath45 at small @xmath35  @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a number of flavours , we get @xmath50 . \\label{2.8}\\ ] ] at @xmath51 ( that is omitting the second term in rhs of  ( [ 2.8 ] ) ) we come to the asymptotical expression for @xmath40 from ref .",
    "@xcite .    using ( [ 2.3 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2.4 ] ) , we get in a general case @xmath52 ,   \\label{2.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 defines the quark / gluon ratio inside the nucleon . as was shown in @xcite , @xmath40 ( [ 2.8 ] ) is a leading correction to @xmath54 which rises with the decreasing of @xmath35 .",
    "all mentioned above is related to the multiple production of the hadrons in dis of lepton off the parton  ( [ ii ] ) .",
    "it is a subprocess of the process of lepton deep inelastic scattering off the nucleon @xmath55 according to refs .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding formula for mean hadron multiplicity in dis looks like @xmath56    the quantitiy @xmath54 has been defined above ( see ( [ 2.9 ] ) ) .",
    "it depends on the effective energy , @xmath57 , available for hadron production in the parton subprocess  ( [ ii ] ) : @xmath58    the average multiplicity of nucleon remnant fragments , @xmath59 , is a function of its invariant mass @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a nucleon mass .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath62 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) was estimated in @xcite to be @xmath63 at present energies .",
    "that is why @xmath17 is less than @xmath64 and the growth of @xmath17 in @xmath13 at fixed @xmath30 is delayed in comparison with that of @xmath64 .",
    "hadronic system @xmath3 in diffractive dis ( [ i ] ) is produced as a result of the virtual photon ",
    "pomeron interaction : @xmath65 the kinematical variables usually used to describe ddis ( in addition to @xmath13 and @xmath30 ) are @xmath66    we start from the fact that pomeron has quark  gluon structure .",
    "it means that hadron production in process  ( [ iv ] ) is similar to that in parton subprocess of dis ( [ ii ] ) .",
    "recently a factorization theorem for ddis has been proven  @xcite .",
    "structure functions of ddis coincide with structure functions of dis and have the same dependence on a factorization scale . as a result",
    ", distribution functions of quark and gluons inside the pomeron , @xmath67 , must obey standard dglap evolution equations at high @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "so , we can conclude that a hadron multiplicity of system @xmath3 in ddis , @xmath68 , is given by expression ( [ 2.9 ] ) , in which @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath11 , while @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath69 .",
    "namely , we get @xmath70 . \\label{3.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath71 is given by formula ( [ 2.8 ] ) and @xmath72 defines quark / gluon ratio inside the pomeron . as both @xmath73 and @xmath74 obey dglap equations , the quantity @xmath71 and , consequently , hadronic multiplicity in ddis are sensitive to the quark",
    " gluon structure of the pomeron at starting scale @xmath75 .    as folllows from ( [ 2.11 ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) , @xmath76 because @xmath16 is defined by @xmath77 , while @xmath78 is expressed via @xmath79 , the quantity @xmath80 being much smaller than @xmath11 by factor @xmath62 ( see ( [ 2.13 ] ) ) .    for @xmath81 gev",
    "we have @xmath82 gev .",
    "it is known that in the region @xmath83 gev function @xmath84 rises logarithmically ( @xmath85 ) that is slower than ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "this results in more rapid growth of @xmath16 in @xmath11 in comparison with @xmath78 .",
    "we conclude from formula ( [ 3.1 ] ) that @xmath86 should exceed @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath88 has to grow in @xmath11 at fixed @xmath30 ( that corresponds to the rise in @xmath89 at fixed @xmath30 ) .",
    "all said above is in good qualitative agreement with the data from h1 collaboration  @xcite .    in fig .  1 we show the result of the fits of the h1 data by using our formula  ( [ 3.1 ] ) ( solid curve ) .",
    "in order to obtain this result , we proceeded as follows .",
    "for the quantity @xmath90 which enters expression  ( [ 3.1 ] ) we used @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are respectively the gluon and the singlet quark distributions inside the pomeron that , as mentioned above , obey dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "for the distributions at the initial scale @xmath94 the following forms were employed : @xmath95 thus , for the quark distribution we fixed an initial hard profile leaving free the normalization parameter , while for the the gluon distribution we have left all parameters free without imposing any sum rule . in order to perform the fit , other elements are needed . in eq .",
    "( [ 3.1 ] ) , for @xmath87 we have used the parametrization @xmath96 with @xmath97 , taken from @xcite . besides that , the experimental data shown in fig.1 are given in terms of average values of @xmath98 and @xmath30 that do not obey strictly the kinematical relation ( [ 3.02 ] ) . in order to be faithful to data",
    ", we employed in our fit the parametrization @xmath99 with @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .    the dotted ( dashed ) line in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to a pure quark ( gluon ) content of the pomeron . the solid line , which gives the fit of the h1 data , is obtained    with parameters @xmath102 and @xmath103 in eqs .",
    "( [ gluon ] ) , which are evolved to the respective @xmath30-value corresponding to each experimental point .",
    "the initial distributions and their evolution with @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "2 . as can be seen , a super - hard profile ( peaked at @xmath104 ) was obtained for the gluon distribution at the initial scale , in qualitative agreeement with h1 analysis @xcite .",
    "the @xmath30evolution of the normalized fractions of the pomeron momentum carried by quarks and gluons is presented in fig .",
    "it is shown that quarks are slightly predominant over gluons at the initial scale , but that this relation reverses as @xmath30 evolves . in this case",
    ", our results do not follow those obtained by h1 collaboration since their analysis @xcite favour a fit in which predominate gluons carrying @xmath105 of pomeron momentum at the initial scale .",
    "it must be said , however , that the results of fig.3 are consistent with limits established in other experiments ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented in this paper a description of the hadron multiplicity obtained in diffractive dis and recently reported by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "this description was derived from a formalism previously developed for ordinary dis within the framework of the perturbative qcd .",
    "the formula obtained enables us to explain the observed excess of hadron multiplicity in diffractive dis , @xmath86 , relative to those in dis and @xmath0 annihilation taken at @xmath106 and @xmath107 , correspondingly .",
    "the more rapid growth of @xmath16 is also understood .",
    "it was shown ( fig.1 ) that neither a pure quark nor a pure gluon content of the pomeron satisfy the data , but that a mixing of both components in approximately equal shares is able to provide a good description of the experimental results .",
    "the pomeron structure function that comes out from the present analysis consists of a hard distribution for the quark singlet and a super - hard distribution for gluons at the initial scale of evolution , in agreement with what has been reported lately in the literature @xcite .",
    "this result is remarkably good if one considers that it was obtained from a very small data set ( only 7 data points ) , covering a limited @xmath69 range ( @xmath108 ) for an equally restricted @xmath30-range ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "concluding , the most important result presented here is the theoretical framework summarized by eq.([3.1 ] ) , that has made it possible to explain anomalous h1 data on hadron multiplicity in ddis .",
    "it also enabled us to extract information about the pomeron structure function from such a limited data set , without the usual complications and ambiguities with flux factor normalization and @xmath110-dependence .",
    "this conclusion points out to the need of more and more precise ddis multiplicity data , taken at extended kinematical ranges . such a possibility would improve a lot the analytical capacity of the scheme presented here",
