    "for the discussion of many astrophysical problems where gravity is important , a major difficulty is set by the potential theory , in particular in the applications where the availability of analytical density - potential pairs deviating from spherical symmetry is important . due both to its relevance and its relation with electrostatic and magnetostatic ( see jackson 1999 ) , it is natural that different techniques have been developed to study this problem ( e.g. , see binney & tremaine 2008 ; see also ciotti & bertin 2005 ; ciotti & giampieri 2007 , hereafter cg07 , and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a particular but very elegant technique .",
    "in fact , in the context of classical electrodynamics newman ( 1973 ; see also newman & janis 1965 , newman et al . 1965 )",
    "considered the case of the electromagnetic field of a point charge displaced on the imaginary axis ; the remarkable properties of the resulting field have been studied by carter ( 1968 ) , lynden - bell ( 2000 , 2002 , 2004a , b , and references therein ; see also teukolsky 1973 ; chandrasekhar 1976 ; page 1976 ) , and kaiser ( 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "this procedure , also known as the _ complex - shift method _ , was first introduced by appell ( 1887 ; see also whittaker & watson 1950 ) to the case of the gravitational field of a point mass , and successively used in general relativity ( e.g. , see gleiser & pullin 1989 ; letelier & oliveira 1987 , 1998 ; dafonseca , letelier & oliveira 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "in the case of classical gravitation , this method has been extended to continuous mass density distributions by cg07 , who considered _ spherical _ parent systems , and obtained new analytical axisymmetric density - potential pairs .",
    "this paper is the natural follow - up of the study of cg07 to _ axisymmetric _ parent systems , not only to further extend the class of new axisymmetric systems , but also to obtain new triaxial density - potential pairs . in section 2",
    "we briefly recall the framework developed in cg07 , and then we discuss the application of the method to axisymmetric parent models . in section 3",
    "we describe the new axisymmetric and triaxial systems obtained from the axial and the equatorial shift of the miyamoto - nagai disc and the binney logarithmic halo , while in section 4 we discuss the projected surface density of the new models .",
    "section 5 summarizes the main results obtained . in appendix a we discuss the expansion of the complexified potential of a generic assigned density distribution in terms of the shift amplitude and , as a by - product , we found two new generating functions in closed form for even and odd legendre polynomials , respectively . in appendix b",
    "we finally present the general solution of an inverse problem associated with the complex - shift method .",
    "here we recall the basic idea of cg07 , who extended the complexification of the coulomb field of a point charge ( e.g. , see lynden - bell 2004b ) , to the gravitational potential @xmath0 of a ( nowhere negative ) density distribution @xmath1 . from now on @xmath2 indicates the position vector , while @xmath3 is the standard inner product over the reals ( repeated index summation convention implied ) .",
    "let assume that @xmath4 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath5 and that the associated complexified potential @xmath6 with shift @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the imaginary unit and @xmath10 is a real vector . from the linearity of the coordinate transformation and of the laplace operator it follows that @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the shifted density",
    "; we recall that in this technique @xmath13 ( e.g. , see lynden - bell 2004b ) . by separating the real and imaginary parts of @xmath6 and @xmath14 obtained from the shift of a known real density - potential pair ( or , if simpler , taking the laplacian of @xmath15 )",
    ", one obtains _ two _ new density - potential pairs .",
    "of course , positivity of the new densities is not assured .",
    "in fact cg07 proved that for a generic parent density @xmath16 , the imaginary part @xmath17 necessarily changes sign because the total mass ( and the total gravitational energy ) of the complexified density - potential pair coincides with the corresponding quantities of the parent ( real ) density - potential pair , so that ( from the mass invariance ) it follows that @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that @xmath17 can not be used to describe a gravitating system . on the other hand",
    ", either cases can happen for the real part @xmath19 , depending on the specific seed density and shift vector adopted .",
    "for example , while @xmath19 of the shifted plummer ( 1911 ) and isochrone ( hnon 1959 ) spheres is positive over the whole space when the module of the shift vector is less than a critical value @xmath20 , @xmath19 of the shifted singular isothermal sphere has negative regions independently of the adopted @xmath21 ( see cg07 ) .      at variance of the spherical case , the result of the complex shift of an axially symmetric potential @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cilindrical radius , depends on the direction of the shift vector @xmath24 . for simplicity in the following sections we consider two special shift directions , namely the axial shift @xmath25 , and the equatorial shift , where without loss of generality we assume @xmath26",
    "; however , some general results for arbitrary shift direction and parent density distributions are postponed to section 4 and appendix a. the axially shifted potential and density are @xmath27 where @xmath28 while in the case of equatorial shift @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the shifted cylindrical radius .",
    "we start by considering the family of models originated by the complex shift of the miyamoto - nagai disc ( 1975 , hereafter mn ; see also binney & tremanine 2008 ) . for convenience",
    "we use the relative potential @xmath31 so that the mn density - potential pair can be written as @xmath32 @xmath33 in the expressions above @xmath34 all the coordinates are in units of the scale - length @xmath35 , while the relative potential and the density are normalized to @xmath36 and to @xmath37 , respectively ; @xmath38 is the total mass of the system . for increasing @xmath39",
    "the density distribution becomes more and more flat and concentrated , while for @xmath40 it reduces to the plummer sphere , for which cg07 has already discussed the complexification and showed that for @xmath41 the real part of the shifted density is nowhere negative .",
    "we then expect that the method applied to mn discs will again produce nowhere negative real densities , at least for discs with low flattening .",
    "the axially shifted mn density can be obtained by the direct complexification of eq .",
    "( [ rhonorm ] ) as @xmath42 in the following the shift modulus @xmath43 is intended expressed in units of @xmath35 .",

    "in particular , we cut the complex @xmath51 plane along the negative real axis so that @xmath52 .",
    "in addition , the natural request that @xmath53 for @xmath54    -0.3truecm -0.2truecm     -0.2truecm     leads to choose @xmath55 .",

    "( [ v definition])-([sin phi definition ] ) and ( [ mn axial pot])-([eta ] ) after separation .",
    "the explicit formulae are however quite cumbersome and are not reported here . in any case , a first check was obtained by comparing term by term the limiting case @xmath40 with the formulae derived in cg07 for the shifted plummer sphere . as an additional check , we also compared the laplacian of @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the corresponding components of the shifted density , for generic @xmath39 .",
    "as expected , @xmath17 changes sign crossing the equatorial plane of the system . for what concerns @xmath19",
    ", a numerical exploration reveals that the density becomes negative on the symmetry axis at @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while the same thing happens at @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "it is apparent how at large distance from the centre the density distribution is almost unaffected by the shift : this is not a pecularity of the present model , but it is a general property of the complex shift , as already recognized by cg07 in the spherical cases , and proved in general in appendix a. the second feature is the toroidal shape of the density near the centre , with a characteristic depression along the shift axis : such structure is curiously similar to the toroidal shapes of the homeoidally expanded density - potential pairs of ciotti & bertin ( 2005 ) and to mond density - potential pairs ( ciotti , nipoti & londrillo 2006 ) , obtained through potential mapping of homeoidally expanded newtonian distribution .",
