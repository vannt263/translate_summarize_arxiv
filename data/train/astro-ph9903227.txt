    "it is now a quarter century since the discovery of the first binary radio pulsar . since 1974",
    ", about fifty other binaries have been discovered , including systems with a wide variety of companions : planets , `` brown dwarfs '' below the hydrogen burning limit , white dwarfs , neutron stars , and massive main sequence stars .    in 1993 ,",
    "the first identification of a pulsar in a triple system was proposed .",
    "psrb1620@xmath026  is an 11ms pulsar associated with the nearby globular cluster m4 .",
    "it is in a 191day , low - eccentricity orbit with a @xmath7 companion presumed to be a white dwarf ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the early pulse timing data were not well described by a simple keplerian model ( @xcite ) .",
    "backer ( 1993 ) was the first to realize that the data could be well fitted with the addition of a substantial cubic term to the pulsar timing model : a change in the apparent spin - down rate of the pulsar that was so large that it predicted a change in sign of the pulsar frequency derivative  from spin - down to spin - up  on a timescale of @xmath8yrs .",
    "such a cubic could be induced by a changing acceleration of the pulsar binary under an external gravitational force , which backer proposed could be due to a second companion in a wide orbit .",
    "further timing observations ( @xcite ) led to measurements of the next two terms in the taylor expansion of the pulsar frequency as well as to the first measurements of perturbations in the orbital elements of the inner binary caused by the tidal effects of the outer body .",
    "these observations in turn led to tighter constraints on the properties of the second orbit ; the second companion most likely has a mass typical of a brown dwarf or planet , @xmath9 , and is in a @xmath10au orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have now been observing psrb1620@xmath026  for over a decade . in  [ sec : obs ] , we describe the various observing systems that have been used . in  [ sec : model ] , we describe the analysis of the data . for the first time",
    ", we present results from a full , two - orbit analysis , rather than a single keplerian orbit combined with a taylor series expansion in pulsar frequency .",
    "we describe the constraints that can be placed on the elements of both the inner and outer orbits from the timing data . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the implications of our measurements for the understanding of the triple system .",
    "since shortly after its discovery , psrb1620@xmath026  has been observed regularly at multiple radio frequencies using several different telescopes .",
    "we report on observations made using the very large array ( vla ) , near socorro , new mexico ; the 43 m telescope at the national radio astronomy observatory in green bank , west virginia ; and the 76 m lovell telescope at jodrell bank , england .    at the vla",
    ", observations were made on one or two days each two or three months from 1990",
    "november 30 to 1998 september 21 , excluding the period from 28 june 1996 to 28 september 1997a total of 49 days . a filter bank and the vla s ``",
    "high time - resolution processor '' were used to divide a 50mhz bandpass at 1.66ghz into 14 slightly overlapping 4mhz channels in each of two orthogonal circular polarizations .",
    "the signal in each frequency channel was sampled and averaged synchronously with the predicted topocentric pulsar period , then the channels were shifted to account for dispersion and added , and the polarizations were summed , to produce a single integrated pulse profile every 5minutes , using a princeton markiii pulsar timing system ( @xcite ) .",
    "the start time of each integration was referenced to external time standards using gps . after eliminating data contaminated with radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) , 486 individual arrival time measurements were available , comprising just over 40hrs of observing time . timing precision varied , with a weighted , root - mean - square precision of 31@xmath11s .    at green bank",
    ", observations were made in campaigns that lasted several days each quarter from 1989 august 20 to 1998 august 7a total of 165 days . at each epoch observations",
    "were made at two frequencies , varying between 400 , 575 , 800 , and 1330mhz .",
    "the `` spectral processor '' fast - fourier transform spectrometer was used to synthesize 512 channels across a 40mhz passband ( 256 channels across 20mhz before 1991 february ) in each of two orthogonal polarizations , and to fold the channels synchronously with the topocentric pulsar period .",
    "the channels and polarizations were summed , as at the vla , to produce a single integrated pulse profile for each integration period .",
    "each integration was begun on a time signal from the site maser , and gps was used to reference observatory time to external standards . after eliminating data contaminated with rfi , 763 arrival time measurements were available , comprising just over 60hrs of observing time , with a weighted , r.m.s .",
    "precision of 40@xmath11s .    at jodrell bank , observations were made on 490 days between 1987 october 15 and 21 october 1998 . on each day , observations were made at either 400 , 600 , 1400 , or 1600mhz . at each frequency , two circular polarizations were observed , using a @xmath12mhz filterbank at 400 and 600mhz , and a @xmath13mhz filterbank at higher frequencies .",
    "the signals were detected , filtered , and the polarizations added , then were sampled and averaged synchronously with the predicted topocentric pulsar period . shifting and adding of channels to account for interstellar dispersion was done in hardware .",
    "there were 537 arrival time measurements available , with weighted , r.m.s .",
    "precision of 45@xmath11s .    in total , the data set spans exactly 31,391,908,721 pulsar rotations .",
    "analysis of the pulse arrival times was carried out with the standard software package tempo ( @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated profiles were cross - correlated with a high - signal - to - noise - ratio average profile to measure the offsets between the start of each integration and the arrival time of a pulse near the center of the integration ( @xcite ) .",
    "the arrival times were fitted with a model that included the pulsar phase at a reference epoch , the pulsar frequency @xmath14 and frequency derivative @xmath15 , the pulsar position ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and proper motion ( @xmath18,@xmath19 ) , the dispersion measure dm and a linear rate of change of the dispersion measure , and the parameters of the known binary orbit : the period @xmath20 , projected semi - major axis @xmath21 , eccentricity @xmath22 , argument of periastron @xmath23 ( measured from the ascending node to periastron in the orbital plane ) , and a time of periastron @xmath24 , as well as other parameters discussed below . and @xmath25 to distinguish the two keplerian orbits that will be discussed , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 in each case to distinguish the pulsar and companion .",
    "this allows us to unambiguously distinguish , for example , the semi - major axis of the pulsar and companion in the first orbit@xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively  as well as the semi - major axis of the pulsar in its first and second orbits@xmath28 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "subscripts will be dropped where redundant ; for example , the orbital period in the first orbit is @xmath31 . ]",
    "the parameters were varied , and the differences between the model and observed arrival times were minimized in a least - squares sense .",
    "the data are weighted to account for large variations in their signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "quoted uncertainties are , unless otherwise noted , intended to be approximately 68% confidence limits ; in general , they are obtained by testing the robustness of the fitted parameter estimates and formal uncertainties when subsections of data are omitted , and through bootstrap monte carlo techniques . typically , quoted error regions are between one and three times as broad as the formal uncertainties reported by the tempo fitting procedure .",
    "timing `` residuals''the observed pulse arrival times minus the model predictions  are calculated ; examples of the observed residuals will be shown below .",
    "in fig.1 , we display the timing residuals for a model containing only a fit for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the astrometric parameters , and a single keplerian orbit .",
    "clearly , the model poorly fits the data ; the residuals are dominated by the cubic term reported by backer ( 1993 ) . that the residuals are cubic in form  rather than linear or quadratic  should not surprise us , since the model that has already been removed from the data contains a second order polynomial : @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an arbitrary time chosen near the center of the data span .",
    "qualitatively similar timing behavior is familiar from studies of young pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "so - called `` red '' timing noise is thought to arise from stochastic interactions between the crust of the neutron star and the superfluid vortices that carry angular momentum in the interior of the star .",
    "there are strong arguments against such an interpretation in the case of psrb1620@xmath026 .",
    "first , our understanding of timing noise suggests that it is inversely correlated with the pulsar age : old , relatively cold millisecond pulsars have relatively little phase wander ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , the magnitude of the observed cubic is very large for any pulsar , independent of age . during the eleven years of observations ,",
    "the pulsar s apparent spin - down rate has varied from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , changing the apparent torque by a factor of more than five ; at the current rate of change , the spin - down of the pulsar will change to an apparent spin - up in november 2000 . while we can not rule out intrinsic spin instabilities as the cause of the observed signal , such instabilities are , in magnitude , unlike any seen in any other pulsar , and have no known theoretical basis .    turning to external causes ,",
    "the most promising explanation of the large @xmath36 is a changing gravitational acceleration ( `` jerk '' ) by a massive body external to the binary . as we have previously discussed ( @xcite ) , the most likely candidate is a second gravitationally - bound companion .",
    "although several pulsars in globular clusters are observed to have positive apparent frequency derivatives due to acceleration in the mean cluster field ( @xcite ) , the central mass density and velocity dispersion in m4 is far too low to produce the observed jerk on the psrb1620@xmath026  system ( @xcite ) .",
    "a close passage by a cluster star on a hyperbolic orbit can not be ruled out , but the chance of discovering the binary during such a transient event is very small ( @xmath37 , @xcite ) .",
    "timing measurements could eventually distinguish between ellipsoidal and hyperbolic orbits for a second companion , but we will not further consider the possibility here .      obviously , a theory - independent way to characterize the deviations of the observations from the standard timing model is to add additional terms to the polynomial for @xmath38 , essentially taylor - expanding the residuals around the epoch @xmath33 .",
    "hence @xmath39 , where we have introduced the convenient notation @xmath40 . given a model for the system , such as acceleration of the binary in the gravitational field of a second companion , the measured @xmath41 can be related to the model parameters .",
    "this is the approach that has previously been used in analysis of psrb1620@xmath026  data ( @xcite ) .",
    "the binary pulsar model can be further generalized to allow secular or periodic variations in the orbital elements .",
    "the simplest extension is to allow the elements to vary linearly with time : for example , @xmath42 , where both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are free parameters in the least - squares fit . in the limit of a keplerian orbit , of course , we expect the time derivatives of the elements to vanish .",

    "however , orbits with smaller eccentricity ( including circular orbits ) are allowed .",
    "we will return to this point below .      within a simple keplerian model ,",
    "there are only five orbital elements accessible from line - of - sight velocity measurements , so only five coefficients in the polynomial expansion are independent .",

    "for example , high order polynomial terms are significantly covariant ( particularly odd terms with odd , and even terms with even ) .",
    "also , the non - uniformity of the data , both in sampling intervals and signal - to - noise ratio achieved , makes it difficult to interpret the fit over the extended data set as a simple taylor expansion around a particular epoch . to avoid these complexities",
    ", we introduce a timing model in which the pulsar orbits in a hierarchical triple system : it is assumed to move in a keplerian orbit around its common center of mass with the inner companion ( possibly with elements that vary linearly with time ) , and the inner binary then orbits about the center of mass of the triple in a second keplerian elipse .",

    "the current distance of the outer companion from the center of mass of the binary is also well constrained , @xmath155au ( 68% ) or @xmath156au ( 95% ) .",
    "less well constrained is the orbital period @xmath100 .",
    "the most favored values are just above the minimum allowed from the @xmath41 measurements , or a few hundred years , but there is a long tail to very long orbital periods .",
    "these solutions correspond to very high eccentricity orbits in which the second companion is currently very near periastron",
    ". the 68% confidence upper limit to the orbital period is 1200yrs .",
    "the inclination of the outer orbit is not well constrained by the data , with a posterior likelihood very close to the assumed @xmath157 prior likelihood . however , the inner inclination is constrained to @xmath158 ( 68% ) or @xmath159 ( 95% ) .",
    "this leads to a most likely inner companion mass of @xmath160 , somewhat higher that the @xmath161 normally assumed .",
    "we have also confirmed that the orbital perturbation measurements and limits are consistent with the solution in which @xmath162 .",
    "in particular , solutions with a circular outer orbit ( table  2 ) are acceptable if @xmath163 and @xmath164 or @xmath165 .",
    "again , @xmath166 is poorly constrained , and @xmath167 , or about half again the mass of jupiter .",
    "since the initial suggestion that pulsar psrb1620@xmath026  is the member of a triple system , constraints on the properties of the system components have gradually improved .",
    "the detection of a secular change in the projected semimajor axis of the inner binary , which has been discussed previously at conferences ( e.g. , @xcite ) but is presented in detail here for the first time , is an important confirmation of the triple nature of the system , since there is no known way for spin instabilities of the pulsar to produce timing fluctuations on the orbital timescale .",
    "the only simple way to understand the system is as a binary accelerating in an external tidal field , most likely due to a bound companion .",
    "as we have shown , the orbital parameters of the outer orbit are still poorly constrained .",
    "the reason is not hard to understand . because the span of available data is much shorter than the period of the outer orbit ,",
    "the relative position of the inner binary and outer companion has not changed substantially since the pulsar was discovered .",
    "although the position itself is known rather accurately , the relative velocity is not .",
    "this leads to a family of allowed solutions , all with periastron distance @xmath3au ( the current separation ) .",
    "very high eccentricity orbits with very large semimajor axis can account for the observed acceleration and orbital perturbations , but only if the system is currently observed near periastron . because a body moving in a high eccentricity orbit spends only a small fraction of the time near periastron ,",
    "such solutions require significant fine tuning .",
    "another remaining source of uncertainty is the extent to which the observed frequency derivative @xmath168 is dominated by acceleration , rather than intrinsic pulsar spin - down .",
    "we have argued that it is most likely that @xmath169 , in which case @xmath170 .",
    "allowing a significant contribution from @xmath171 reduces the magnitude of the acceleration by the third body , allowing masses as small as @xmath172 .    in either case , the second companion is almost certain substellar : below the @xmath173 hydrogen burning limit , and is most likely below or near the deuterium burning limit , @xmath174 ( @xcite ) . whether it is called a `` brown dwarf '' or",
    "a `` planet '' is probably not important .",
    "the possibility that such objects might be found in globular clusters was first suggested just prior to the discovery of the triple nature of psrb1620@xmath026  ( @xcite ) , and sigurdsson ( 1993 , 1995 ) has further suggested models for the formation of such a triple involving exchange interactions in the dense environment of m4 . however , developing a complete model that can explain not only the system formation and stability and the pulsar spin - up , but also the non - zero eccentricity of the inner binary remains an open problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "the prospects for continued improvement of the timing constraints on the system parameters are good .",
    "we expect ( eqns .",
    "[ eqn : perb1][eqn : perb3 ] ) that the timescales for perturbation of @xmath23 and @xmath22 should be comparable to that of @xmath65 , and as noted in ",
    "[ sec : poly ] the current measurement uncertainties have nearly reached that level .",
    "furthermore , the limits on @xmath62 already significantly constrain the allowed solutions , and we expect the uncertainty to improve rapidly with observing span .",
