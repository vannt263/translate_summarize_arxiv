    "[ fig.contalphas-gold ] displays the contours of the _ statistical _ 1-sigma errors @xmath140 for the standard @xmath12 channel in the @xmath141 $ ] mass plane for ilc , irrespective of any specific model except susy - qcd . for each @xmath144 mass",

    "the yukawa coupling @xmath63 can be determined in this channel only indirectly through virtual susy corrections .",
    "such analyses may provide a first glimpse of the yukawa coupling .",
    "+ the figures in the middle and on the right of the panel summarize _ statistical _ analyses of the golden @xmath1 channel on the same basis . in this channel",

    "+ the estimate of the statistical error @xmath148 for the measurement of the yukawa coupling in this report is only a first step .",
    "the step is promising , nevertheless , as the expected error is sufficiently small .",
    "even if an order of magnitude of events is lost due to experimental cuts and efficiencies in controlling , for example , the chargino and neutralino modes of squark decays [ and cascading gluinos ] , the resulting final error is still at a level of 5 to 10% .",
    "this size compares reasonably well with expectations for lhc experimental analyses in ref .",

    "thus , lhc and a tev lepton collider are complementary instruments for the involved measurements of the susy - qcd yukawa and gauge couplings .",
    "in particular , since the relevant cross sections drop with rising squark and gluino masses quadratically and faster , mutual complementarity of the two methods raises prospects of testing the identity of yukawa and gauge couplings in super - qcd considerably .",
