    "this is described in section 3 .",
    "to evaluate the performance of lhcb in the reconstruction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays , a full geant monte carlo simulation has been performed , followed by realistic pattern recognition algorithms for the track reconstruction and particle identification .",

    "the other channels are studied as potential sources of background . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the previous results for the @xmath3 channel are obtained for a value of the mixing parameter @xmath7 . due to the finite proper time resolution of the spectrometer ( about @xmath8 ) , higher values of @xmath9 , i.e. faster @xmath10 oscillations , lead to larger errors for the measurements of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "thus , a study of the dependence of the resolution of @xmath11 and @xmath12 on @xmath9 , up to @xmath13 , has been performed .",
    "the results of this study for @xmath11 are shown in fig .",

    "the results presented in this paper show the potential of lhcb in collecting large samples of @xmath14 and @xmath3 decays .",
    "they are obtained by using a full and realistic monte carlo simulation of the detector response .",
    "the number of @xmath14 offline - selected decays are 27000/year , while for @xmath3 it is 35000/year , with background - to - signal ratios respectively of about 0.8 and 0.55 .",
    "the sensitivity on the cp - violating observables achievable by lhcb for these channels has been studied in detail , yielding very encouraging results .",
    "the estimated precision on @xmath11 and @xmath12 after one year of data taking , assuming @xmath9 to be equal to 20 , is 0.054 for the @xmath14 channel and 0.043 for the @xmath3 channel .    by means of these observables it is possible to extract the @xmath4 angle of the unitarity triangle .",
    "in fact , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , related to the @xmath2 decay , can be expressed in the framework of the standard model as :    @xmath15    @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 mixing phase , while @xmath19 and @xmath20 parametrize - sloppily speaking - the penguin over tree amplitude ratio of the decay transition @xcite .",
    "analogously , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , related to the @xmath3 decay , can be written as    @xmath21    @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath10 mixing phase , @xmath24 , and the @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameters are analogous to @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the @xmath3 transition .    in the limit of exact u - spin symmetry of the strong interactions",
    "the relations @xmath27 and @xmath28 hold , and the measurements of the four asymmetry coefficients allow to determine @xmath29 and @xmath4 simultaneously , provided that @xmath30 is determined elsewhere ( e.g. through the @xmath31 transition ) or considered negligibly small , as it is expected in the standard model .",
    "moreover @xmath29 will be accurately known at the time of lhcb , thus allowing a more precise determination of @xmath4 .",
    "the resolution on @xmath4 achievable at lhcb by using this method , in case of negligible u - spin breaking effects , is of the order of few degrees .",
