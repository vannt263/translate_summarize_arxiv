    "current experiments at the brookhaven rhic and another to be started soon at the cern lhc are engaged in creating and understanding the phase of matter called the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the existence of this phase was predicted by lattice qcd , and this technique has been used to study many properties of the plasma . in spite of this , much remains to be done .",
    "one of the major questions , that which concerns us here , is the nature of the interactions between quasiparticle excitations .",
    "decisive information on flavoured quasiparticles has come from a recent study of the linkage between quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "a rapid and clear change in the linkage between quantum numbers was seen across the qcd phase transition . in the high temperature phase flavour quantum numbers such as baryon number , charge , strangeness ,",
    "are linked to each other in ways that suggest that the light flavoured excitations at finite temperature qcd include quarks .    at the same time",
    "it is clear that the interactions between these quasiparticles can not be small . at length scales of order @xmath6 , the qcd coupling , @xmath7 ,",
    "is of order 1 @xcite , leading to well known problems .",
    "for example , the debye screening length of gluons is more complicated than one expects in perturbation theory @xcite and contains pieces which are entirely non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative pieces have been isolated and studied on the lattice @xcite .",
    "interestingly , when one studies the screening of glueball - like quantities , , spatial correlations of colour singlet operators made out of gauge fields , then a surprising simplicity arises above about @xmath8 . taking two quantum number channels which can be constructed by a minimum of two and three gluon operators , the ratio of the screening masses is seen to be close to 3/2 @xcite .",
    "there are parallels in the study of hadron - like screening correlators in the qcd plasma .",
    "parity doubling was seen in the high - temperature phase of qcd in the first study of these correlators using staggered quarks @xcite .",
    "further , this first study already showed that the screening mass from the baryon - like correlator was 3/2 times the screening mass from some of the meson - like correlators .",
    "a finite size scaling study using staggered quarks @xcite showed that a particular combination of the vector and axial - vector meson - like correlators was very close to the free - field theory ( , ideal gas ) predictions .",
    "this behaviour is generic , being seen in quenched @xcite and dynamical qcd with two @xcite and four @xcite flavours of staggered quarks as well as with wilson quarks @xcite .",
    "extrapolation to the continuum using staggered quarks @xcite showed that the remaining screening masses approached their ideal - gas values .",
    "however , the correlators differed strongly from the ideal - gas correlators at small distances .",
    "this was also seen in a later study of screening correlators with wilson quarks @xcite .",
    "overlap quarks @xcite have the advantage of preserving all chiral symmetries on the lattice for any number of massless flavors of quarks @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to other formulations , such as wilson s , which break all chiral symmetries , or the staggered , which break them partially .",
    "since the number of pions and their nature is intimately related to the actually realized chiral symmetry on the lattice , one expects any realization of chiral quarks on the lattice to provide insight into this question .    in our earlier study of screening correlators using overlap quarks @xcite with lattice spacing @xmath9 ,",
    "the correlation functions were found to decay exponentially at large separation , and showed none of the fine structure that plague staggered and wilson quarks . as a result ,",
    "the screening mass was a good parametrization of the screening correlator at large distances .",
    "the screening masses in all channels were closer to the expected weak - coupling continuum limit for overlap quarks than staggered and wilson .",
    "however , that from the ( would be zero - temperature ) scalar and pseudoscalar was lower by about 10% than the others .    in this paper",
    "we extract complete information on meson - like screening correlators by extending the analysis of @xcite to overlap quarks . at the same time",
    ", we extend the analysis towards the continuum limit by using lattice spacings of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . with these two inputs we are able to resolve all the currently outstanding questions on screening correlators .",
    "parts of these results were presented in @xcite .",
    ".the break up of irreps under the successive breakings of the symmetries of the transfer matrix .",
    "the @xmath10 components of the v / av correspond to the @xmath11 polarization and the @xmath12 to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 polarizations .",
    "all states also carry a label for charge conjugation , @xmath15 .",
    "this has been dropped in this paper since we consider only the @xmath16 states . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the computation of propagators using the overlap dirac operator of eq .",
    "( [ overlapdirac ] ) needs a nested set of two matrix inversions for its evaluation ( each step in the numerical inversion of @xmath17 involves the inversion of @xmath18 ) .",
    "this squaring of effort makes a study of qcd with dynamical overlap quarks very expensive . as before",
    ", we therefore chose to work with quenched overlap quarks .",
    "we generated quenched qcd configurations at temperatures of @xmath19 = 2 on @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 lattices ( see table [ tb.summary ] ) .",
    "the corresponding couplings are respectively @xmath23 6.0625 , 6.3384 and 6.55 .",
    "note that these are the known critical couplings on @xmath24 , 12 and 16 lattices . for the latter ,",
    "no infinite volume extrapolation was available , unlike the first two .",
    "our choice was motivated by the 2-loop @xmath25-function , and consistency with the the finite volume results . in each case , the configurations were separated by 1000 sweeps of a cabibbo - marinari update .    for the matrix @xmath26 , and a given source vector @xmath27 , we computed @xmath28 by using the zolotarev algorithm @xcite : m^-1/2 b = _ l=1^n_o ( b )  ,   [ za ] where the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 are computed with jacobi elliptic functions once one has the order of approximation @xmath31 and the ratio @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the boundaries of the domain where we apply the approximation . in our implementation of the algorithm @xcite , we first compute the lowest and highest eigenvalues of @xmath35 and then choose @xmath33 and @xmath34 so that the domain of applicability of the zolotarev approximation is 10% larger than the domain spanned by the eigenvalues .",
    "the order @xmath31 is defined by requiring a precision @xmath36 for the approximation of @xmath37 in the entire domain . with these parameters ,",
    "one calculates the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ za ] ) by a multishift cg - inversion at the precision @xmath36 .    on each gauge configuration we computed @xmath38 on 12 point sources ( 3 colors and 4 spins ) for 8 quark masses from @xmath39=0.008 to 0.8 using a multi - mass inversion of @xmath40 . the ( negative ) wilson mass term in @xmath41 , , @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ wilson ] ) , which is an irrelevant regulator , was set to 1.8 .",
    "the tolerance ranged from @xmath43 to @xmath44 in the inner cg and @xmath45 to @xmath46 in the outer cg , with most of the work done using the larger values of @xmath47 .",
    "we remark on the choice in a later section .",
    "typical @xmath48 needed was about 7 - 8 .    for most configurations we found that the spectrum of @xmath49 starts well away from zero",
    "however , very occasionally ( one each for @xmath50 and 8) we found a zero mode , , an unpaired eigenvalue @xmath51 . as discussed in the literature , such zero modes have to be subtracted off to obtain averages of physical quantities such as the correlation functions .",
    "we showed elsewhere that our determination of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues is precise enough that we can subtract out the zero mode contribution in the chiral condensate .",
    "the resultant subtracted condensate ( or correlators ) is well within the statistical distribution of the measurement obtained in the sample without zero modes , at all the couplings and lattice sizes studied .",
    "we therefore chose not to include the zero mode contributions below .",
    "furthermore , we show below results for our lowest quark mass @xmath39 = 0.008 , as the main features are essentially quark mass independent .",
    "we have checked that the sum of the s and ps correlators vanishes within errors in all our measurements , in agreement with the correlator identities for overlap quarks . for the v and av correlators we checked that the difference of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 polarization correlators vanish within errors , thus verifying that they lie in the same irrep of the symmetry group , as indicated by table [ tb.symm ] .    in figure [ fg.symm ]",
    "we show the screening correlator obtained from various polarizations of the v. the @xmath11-direction polarization gives the @xmath52 and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 directions give the @xmath53 . in the figure",
    "we show the correlator from the sum of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 polarizations .",
    "we also show the corresponding correlator obtained from a free field theory ( fft ) computation .",
    "note the close agreement between the @xmath53 correlator in the the quenched theory and the fft results , over six orders of magnitude change in the correlator .",
    "we will examine this in more detail later .",
    "the disagreement between the fft and the full theory for the @xmath52 correlator shown in figure [ fg.symm ] requires further analysis . when the tolerance in the fermion inversion was decreased , the @xmath53 correlator changed only marginally , whereas the @xmath52 correlator changed sign at @xmath54 on some gauge configurations .",
    "however , further work is required to check whether these correlators also turn negative as the tolerance is decreased further .    in the past the sum of the three polarizations of the @xmath55 vector",
    "have been analyzed together . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is incorrect , since it mixes the @xmath12 and @xmath56 irreps .",
    "however , the screening correlator in the latter irrep is almost an order of magnitude smaller than that in the former . as a result ,",
    "the screening masses extracted by the older method is a fairly accurate measure of the screening mass in the @xmath12 channel .",
    "in fact , we find that the screening mass from the @xmath53 correlator at @xmath57 is @xmath58 whereas that from the mixed representation is @xmath59 .",
    "the two screening masses are compatible with each other at the @xmath60 level .    with this caveat in mind , in the remainder of this paper we shall report results obtained with the older method of analysis , where the v correlator sums over all the polarizations .",
    "it has the advantage that the results are directly comparable with earlier results , and is not far removed from the quantitatively correct results which would be obtained by following the theoretically correct method .      in figure [ fg.corr ]",
    "we compare the measured correlation functions in the s and v channels .",
    "it is noteworthy that the v correlator agrees rather well with the ideal gas correlation functions from @xmath61 all the way to @xmath62 , when the correlator itself falls by 67 orders of magnitude . to make this spectacular point more forcefully ,",
    "we have plotted in figure [ fg.ratid ] the ratio of the measured correlator with the ideal gas .",
    "it is clear that the v ( @xmath53 ) correlator differs from the ideal gas by no more than 10 - 20% everywhere except ( possibly ) near the center of the lattice .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for the s ( @xmath63 ) correlator .",
    "this agrees well with the ideal gas up to a distance @xmath64 . at distances larger than this",
    ", the s channel correlator falls significantly slower than the ideal gas result ( figure [ fg.corr ] ) .",
    "this is shown again in figure [ fg.ratid ] , where it becomes clear that the ratio of the correlators changes by a factor of about 5 when the correlators themselves have changed by about 6 orders of magnitude .      in some applications",
    "the momentum space correlator is a more direct input , giving emphasis to the small @xmath65 region .",
    "our lattice data can be exhibited in momentum space by a fourier transformation of the separation @xmath65 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions give rise to a brillouin zone structure as usual , and only momenta in the range @xmath66 are independent .",
    "we show the momentum space correlators in figure [ fg.mom ] .",
    "it turns out that the ideal gas result needs to be multiplied by a constant ( independent of @xmath67 ) in order to describe the data well .",
    "however , after this normalization , which we choose to fix the correlator at @xmath68 , the shapes of the correlators are in rough agreement with the ideal gas results , except at small @xmath67 . from figure [ fg.mom ]",
    "another interesting feature which is visible is that the correlators at two different lattice spacings , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , after the scaling by @xmath69 , show no significant dependence on lattice spacing at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "however , there are small differences visible at low momenta , @xmath74 , for both the s and v correlators . with decreasing @xmath75 ,",
    "these residual @xmath75-dependent effects go in the direction of slightly improving the agreement with free field theory for v , and of making matters slightly worse for s.    the small disagreements with free field theory can be better exhibited by displaying the ratio of the correlator and its ideal gas counterpart- @xmath76 .",
    "these ratios are shown in the v and s channels for the @xmath77 lattice in figure [ fg.momrat ] .",
    "the ratio shows clear structure . near the center of the brillouin zone , @xmath78",
    ", the ratios go to a momentum independent constant . however , this constant is different from unity , and also different in the two channels .",
    "for @xmath79 the ratio is clearly momentum dependent . in the s channel ,",
    "the ratio decreases with @xmath67 whereas in the v channel it increases . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there is no prediction or understanding of such structures in weak coupling theory .",
    "one can extract screening masses from the correlators in two different ways .",
    "one is by fitting a single cosh to the long distance part of the screening correlator .",
    "the other method is to use the ratio @xmath80 and the assumption that at distance between @xmath65 and @xmath81 is described by a single cosh to extract a distance dependence effective mass , @xmath82 .",
    "if there is a clear plateau in the effective mass as a function of @xmath65 , which agrees with the fitted value , then one could reliably talk of a screening mass and its value .    in figure [ fg.localm ]",
    "we exhibit the result of such a test .",
    "it is clear that there is a stable plateau over almost half the available distances , and the local mass in this region ( @xmath83 ) agrees well with the results of a fit over the same range .",
    "this is quite different from earlier studies of staggered and wilson quarks , where a stable plateau in the local masses was not observed .",
    "note also the need for aspect ratios @xmath84 in order to stabilize the local masses at their asymptotic value .",
    "notice the non - monotonicity of the local masses at the smallest distance .",
    "if the correlation function could be expressed in the spectral form c(z ) = _ i a_i , with all the @xmath85 , , the correlation function came from a transfer matrix satisfying reflection positivity , then the local masses would be a non - increasing function of distance for @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , therefore , the data shows that this condition is violated .",
    "such behaviour has been observed with both staggered and wilson quarks earlier .",
    "note also the lack of convexity of the screening correlators in figure [ fg.corr ] , which is also a consequence of the violation of reflection positivity .",
    "in figure [ fg.scrm ] we plot the ratio of screening masses extracted in quenched qcd to that in a free field theory of overlap quarks on the same lattice , @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath88 at fixed @xmath0 . in the v channel the ratio is consistent with unity . in the s channel",
    ", however , the ratio differs from unity at the 95% confidence level but is almost independent of the lattice spacing .",
    "we have shown results for two values of the aspect ratio , @xmath89 and 2 .",
    "at the smallest lattice spacing we have only @xmath90 .",
    "it would be useful to extend these computations to larger @xmath91 .",
    "if reflection positivity of the screening correlators were to hold , then one would expect the screening masses not to increase with @xmath91 .",
    "however , in figure [ fg.scrm ] we see that this exactly what happens , again indicating that reflection positivity is violated .    in view of our results , it is interesting to ask whether it is possible that at some larger value of @xmath92 there is a cross over to a regime where @xmath93 is closer to @xmath94 .",
    "if such were the case , then one should be able to identify the physics of such a cross over .",
    "there is only one such piece of physics , and that is the scale of non - locality of the overlap dirac operator .",
    "this has been studied in @xcite , where it was shown that the scale of non - locality varies smoothly towards zero as the lattice cutoff decreases .",
    "this allows us to rule out a cross over from the observed behaviour of @xmath93 to trivial physics .",
    "a direct comparison of the screening masses in the s and v channels is shown in figure [ fg.scrcomp ] . from this",
    "it is clear that these two masses differ from each other at the 95% confidence limit at the smallest lattice spacing that we use , and show no tendency to move towards equality . since the ratio @xmath95 is within 5% of unity , an explanation within a weak coupling expansion seems possible .",
    "however , there is no such explanation available at this time .",
    "we have performed a group theoretical analysis of the screening transfer matrix at finite temperature .",
    "quark bilinear operators , in the @xmath96 sector , which are classified as s , ps , v and av at zero temperature can be decomposed at finite temperature as shown in table [ tb.symm ] .",
    "the thermal state @xmath52 is obtained in the decomposition of both the ps and v. parity doubling is not a consequence of the group theory , but arises dynamically . some identities which can be proven for the topologically trivial sector of overlap quarks , eq .",
    "( [ ids ] ) , show parity doubling .",
    "we presented an argument that if the ps and v are not to be degenerate at low temperatures , then they can not be degenerate at any temperature .",
    "the theory of free overlap quarks is consistent with the converse , since it gives a degeneracy between the ps and v at all temperature . as a result",
    ", this theory can not be an accurate representation of all aspects of qcd at finite temperature",
    ".      1 .",
    "the correlation function in the @xmath53 sector ( v ) is very close to that in free field theory . in the @xmath63 sector",
    "( s ) there is a significant difference at large distances , , for @xmath83 .",
    "however , the magnitude of such differences are small compared to the observed fall of the correlation function by 6 orders of magnitude over the distances involved .",
    "both the s and v correlators are very close to the prediction of free field theory at distance less than @xmath97 .",
    "the screening mass of the v is consistent with the free field theory of overlap quarks , whereas that of the s is lighter by about 5% at the 95% confidence limit .",
    "this behaviour persists into the continuum limit .",
    "the s and v correlators in momentum space agree with free field theory of overlap quarks , after an overall normalization , only near the center of the brillouin zone .",
    "the part with @xmath98 differs from free field theory for both the s and the v. 5 .",
    "there is evidence that the screening transfer matrix does not have reflection positivity .",
    "this implies that screening in finite temperature qcd can not be equivalent to the zero temperature physics of a temperature dependent hamiltonian .",
    "this statement is not controversial , since screening phenomena at finite temperature crucially involve a mixed state density matrix , whereas correlations at zero temperature involve pure quantum states .",
    "this work was funded by the indo - french centre for the promotion of advanced research under its project number 3104 - 3 .",
    "these computations were performed on the cray x1 of the indian lattice gauge theory initiative ( ilgti ) in tifr , mumbai .",
