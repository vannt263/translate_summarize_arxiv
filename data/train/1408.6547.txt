    "the process in which a false vacuum of a scalar field theory decays by the nucleation of true vacuum bubbles was first studied in detail some time ago  @xcite .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate has the exponential suppression typical of tunneling processes , with the exponent being twice the wkb barrier penetration integral or , equivalently , the euclidean action of the bounce solution to the euclidean field equations  @xcite . by using path integral methods to calculate the energy density of the false vacuum , the pre - exponential factor",
    "can also be obtained  @xcite .",

    "an essential ingredient of this calculation is the fact that @xmath6 has a single negative eigenvalue , which arises from a mode corresponding to expansion or contraction of the bounce .",
    "because of the square root , this negative mode leads to a factor of @xmath7 that makes the false vacuum energy complex , with its imaginary part interpreted in terms of a rate of decay by bubble nucleation . it is crucial here that there is only a single negative eigenvalue and thus one factor of @xmath7 ; if , for example , there were an even number of such eigenvalues , the contribution to the false vacuum energy would be purely real .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the bounce with lowest action has one , and only one , negative mode  @xcite .",
    "coleman and de luccia ( cdl )  @xcite proposed that this formalism could be extended to include gravitational effects by adding a euclidean einstein - hilbert term to the action .",
    "although they did not address the issue of the prefactor , it seems natural to assume that it should be analogous to that for the non - gravitational case , and that the dominant bounce should again have a single negative mode .",
    "the matter is complicated by the fact that with gravity included the fluctuations about the bounce enjoy a gauge freedom , corresponding to the invariance under coordinate transformations of the underlying theory .",
    "a consequence of this gauge freedom is the existence of constraints that must be imposed on the possible fluctuations .",
    "a number of authors have studied the negative mode issue in the context of bounces corresponding to bubble nucleation in a de sitter spacetime  @xcite . some curious , troubling , and",
    "sometimes contradictory , results , often depending on the choice of gauge , have been obtained . among these",

    "there is another aspect that should be addressed . when anomalous or apparently meaningless mathematical results are encountered , it is often the case that they are indicative of a particular physical aspect of the problem being studied .",
    "thus , one should look for a physical understanding as to why these negative modes arise ( or do not ) in particular cases , even if they can ultimately be eliminated from the calculation . also , one should expect to find a smooth transition from the curved spacetime calculation to the non - gravitational one in an appropriate limit .",
    "ideally , this should include not just a continuous evolution of the bounce and its action , but also a gradual disappearance of the potential pathologies as one approaches the limit in which @xmath8 .",
    "as we will see , this limit is rather subtle .",
    "our goal in this paper is to make some progress toward this end by exploring the regions where the quadratic fluctuation action becomes negative .",
    "we work in a purely lagrangian framework . rather than fixing a gauge",
    ", we impose the requirement that the fluctuations obey the constraint , and then write the quadratic fluctuation lagrangian in terms of manifestly gauge - invariant combinations of fields . for fluctuations about a bounce with o(4)-symmetry , which we assume , the objects of primary interest are spherically symmetric scalar fluctuations , which can be described by a single field @xmath9 .",

    "there is potentially a negative-@xmath213 region about the `` equator '' at @xmath235 . by symmetry , @xmath236 here , so both terms in @xmath237 vanish at the equator .",
    "if the bounces have radii much less than the horizon length , @xmath211 will be exponentially small , @xmath213 will be positive , and the infinite set of oscillating negative modes will be absent . on the other hand , with larger bounces one can easily find parameters that would make the first term smaller than the second in the region close to the equator , giving a negative @xmath213 and a family of oscillating negative modes .",
    "having seen that two - bounce solutions may or may not have negative-@xmath213 regions , let us turn to the more generic multibounce case , with many component small bounces .",

    "although we have no overall o(4 ) symmetry to guide us , we can look to our analysis of the single bounce case for guidance .",
    "we begin by remarking that the fields in the interior of each domain are , to a good approximation , the same as those in a region of comparable size about the bounce in a one - bounce solution .",
    "since the rapidly oscillating negative modes in the one - bounce solution have support far from this region , we should not expect to find them in the domain interiors .",
    "hence , if rapidly oscillating negative modes exist , they should be located near the domain boundaries .",
    "however , even that seems quite unlikely . with many component bounces ,",
    "the typical domain size is much smaller than the curvature radius of the underlying four - sphere .",
    "thus , viewed on the scale of a few domains , the solution is barely distinguishable from the corresponding flat - space multibounce configuration , which we know has no oscillating negative modes . to phrase this differently , in the one - bounce solution",
    "the negative-@xmath213 region is a thin three - sphere shell with a curvature radius equal to that of the four - sphere background . in the multibounce configuration",
    "the domain boundaries approximate thin three - sphere shells with curvature radii much smaller than that of the underlying background .    we conclude that while rapidly oscillating negative modes exist for the one - bounce solution , and possibly even for quasi - stationary points with a handful of bounces , they will be absent for configurations with many bounces .",

    "of course , the four - volume was understood to be taken to infinity at the end of the calculation , so the conclusion was that the path integral was dominated by configurations in which the bounces were infinite in number but with a finite density of the order of @xmath1 .",
    "if we ignore for the moment any complications from rapidly varying negative modes ( which will , in any case , be absent if @xmath42 is large ) , then analogous reasoning leads to the conclusion that the dominant configurations for de sitter tunneling should be ones with @xmath240 component bounces .",
    "the first factor , @xmath241 , is the four - volume of the euclidean de sitter space .",
    "the second factor is ( apart from a factor of 2 ) the usual expression for the nucleation rate per unit volume , @xmath1 .",
    "dimensional analysis suggests that @xmath242 depending on the parameters of the scalar field theory , this ratio could easily be much less than or much greater than unity ; given the exponential dependence on the bounce action , obtaining a value very close to unity , while possible , is unlikely .",

    "if @xmath244 the contributions from multibounce configurations are negligible , and the single - bounce solution , with its infinite set of negative modes , makes the important contribution to the path integral .",
    "in examining various cdl bounces , we have found patterns of negative modes that are rather different from those encountered in the absence of gravity . it seems natural to ask why matters are nt the same as in flat spacetime . however , one might instead ask why they should be the same .",
    "the issue is not so much the formal difference between the two cases , with constraints and gauge issues involved in one case and not the other , but rather the fact that different physical processes come into play when gravitational effects are included .",
    "this can be seen already in the case of small bounces , with all mass scales far below the planck mass and the bounce radius much less than the horizon distance . in the absence of gravity",
    "we have a standard first - order transition . once the transition begins ( e.g. , by cooling below a critical temperature ) small bubbles start to nucleate in the initial false vacuum .",
    "these bubbles then expand , collide , and coalesce to form a homogeneous true vacuum .",
    "varying the magnitude of @xmath1 changes the time scale for completion of the transition , but makes no qualitative change in the process .",
    "with gravity brought into play , and a de sitter false vacuum , matters are more complicated .",
    "if @xmath245 , the time scale for bubble nucleation , expansion , and coalescence is short compared to the hubble time and the transition to a homogeneous new phase is completed very much as in flat spacetime . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath244 , the cosmic expansion outpaces the bubble nucleation and the transition to the true vacuum is never truly completed  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath246 is less than a critical value @xmath247 ( which can be shown to lie in the range @xmath248 ) , then the new phase never percolates  @xcite . instead , false vacuum regions always remain , continuing to nucleate new bubbles of the true vacuum , and eternal inflation ensues .",
    "the underlying explanation for the difference between the two cases is the manner in which the bubble grows in de sitter space .",
    "after nucleating with a small initial radius , the bubble expands at a speed that quickly approaches the speed of light , with the bubble wall approximately tracing out a light cone . on time",
    "scales much less than @xmath0 , there is very little difference from the flat - space case ; if @xmath1 is large enough for the transition to have been completed by this time , nothing unusual is found .",
    "however , once @xmath249 and the bubble radius approaches the horizon length , the cosmic expansion dominates and the bubble radius , as measured in comoving coordinates , becomes essentially constant .",
    "hence , bubbles that are initially separated by a distance greater than @xmath250 never meet .",
    "bubbles that nucleate later have smaller asymptotic comoving sizes ; they nucleate and expand in the spaces left between the older bubbles , but never quite fill out these false vacuum regions .",
    "the bounce solution itself shows no distinction between the regimes of large and small @xmath246 . in both cases",
    "the cdl bounce approaches the flat - space solution as @xmath251 .",

    "these have the usual expansion / contraction negative modes , one for each component bounce , but no indication at all of any anomalous rapidly varying negative modes .",
    "if instead @xmath244 , only the single - bounce configuration , with its rapidly oscillating negative modes near @xmath234 , is relevant .    while these @xmath234 modes do not appear in some hamiltonian choices of gauge and , because their eigenvalues are super - planckian ,",
    "may well disappear with a proper treatment of quantum gravity , there is another class of modes that also distinguishes between the two regimes . as we saw in eq .",
    "( [ l2forallell ] ) , the @xmath191 modes make no contribution to the quadratic fluctuation lagrangian about a single bounce .",
    "the zero - eigenvalue @xmath191 modes simply correspond to translation of the bounce , and must be replaced by collective coordinates even in flat spacetime . however , the flat - space @xmath191 modes with nonzero eigenvalue are true fluctuation modes , and it is puzzling that they do not have direct analogues about the single de sitter cdl bounce . with the multibounce configurations matters",
    "are different .",
    "the low - lying fluctuations in the neighborhood of each component bounce , including the ones that locally look like @xmath191 modes , closely approximate their flat - space counterparts .",
    "thus , for relatively rapid nucleation , with @xmath253 , the physical processes proceed very much as in flat spacetime , and the calculation of @xmath1 , including the pre - exponential factor , smoothly transitions between the gravitational and the non - gravitational cases . if instead @xmath244 , the physical process in the presence of gravity is qualitatively different from when @xmath254 , and this difference is reflected in the calculation of the pre - exponential factor .",
    "note that @xmath234 , where the potential pathologies in the calculation arise , corresponds to the location of the horizon in the initial and final states .",
    "this fits nicely with the fact that it is the existence of a horizon that is responsible for the failure of the transition to truly complete .",
    "it is instructive to recall that the basis of the path integral calculation was the interpretation of the imaginary part of the energy of the false vacuum in terms of the lifetime of an unstable false vacuum state .",
    "on relatively small scales , with or without gravity , we have a region of space that is initially in a homogeneous false vacuum state and then tunnels to a state in which a true vacuum bubble is embedded in a surrounding false vacuum region . on a larger scale , matters are more subtle . without gravity , or with gravity and @xmath255 , the continued bubble nucleation leads to a complete transition to the true vacuum ; the false vacuum unambiguously decays . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath244 , an eternal inflation scenario results and the false vacuum never fully disappears ; in a sense , its lifetime is infinite .    let us turn now to the case of large bounces , but , as always , with all mass scales well below the planck scale .",
    "several physical processes are possible .",
    "first , we can have nucleation of a single bubble that , even initially , occupies a large fraction of a horizon volume .",
    "given the size of the bubble , the possibility of multibounce configurations is severely constrained .",
    "second , there can be bounces that occupy a full horizon volume and that are naturally interpreted as mediating transitions that occur over the entire horizon volume .",
    "these include type b bounces , with a horizon volume of one vacuum tunneling into a horizon volume of a different vacuum , and hawking - moss bounces , with an entire horizon volume thermally fluctuating to the top of the potential barrier .",
    "we might also include here the oscillating bounce solutions .",
    "although it has been argued that these are not relevant for vacuum transitions because they have multiple negative modes even when the gravitational background is held fixed  @xcite , it may be that this conclusion should be revisited .",
    "finally , there can be `` up - tunneling '' , with a bubble of a higher ( false ) vacuum forming within a region of lower ( true ) vacuum  @xcite .",
    "issues of time - slicing arise when considering these bubbles . in discussions of vacuum tunneling",
    "one often speaks as if the bubble nucleates suddenly and simultaneously over a hypersurface of constant time , with the classical evolution and expansion of the bubble beginning sharply at some @xmath256 . even ignoring the neglect of the quantum fuzziness , already in flat spacetime there is an ambiguity due to the possibility of lorentz boosting the nucleation hypersurface , although this is known to not affect the large time evolution of the bubble  @xcite .",
    "this issue becomes more acute with de sitter bubble nucleation , especially for the case of large bounces .",
    "for example , if the de sitter spacetime is described in global , closed - universe coordinates , then one can always find a de sitter transformation that brings the center of the bounce to a point on the @xmath257 `` waist '' of the de sitter hyperboloid and the nucleation hypersurface to this hypersurface . indeed , this is the simplest choice for continuing the euclidean solution to a lorentzian one . from this viewpoint , the horizon volume occupies half of the full @xmath257 de sitter space , and the nucleated bubble a large fraction of that half .",
    "alternatively , one could use flat - universe coordinates ( which cover half of the fully extended de sitter spacetime ) . with this choice",
    "a spacelike hypersurface of fixed time is infinite in extent and the initial horizon volume , and the nucleated bubble within it , appear as just small regions within a larger universe .",
    "this latter viewpoint fits much better with the idea that the vacuum transition should not be sensitive to the global structure of spacetime .",
    "even with a given choice of slicing , there are ambiguities in defining particles , and thus the vacuum state , for the true vacuum , and perhaps even more so for the false vacuum . the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite derived the cdl bounce by working within the static coordinate patch of a horizon volume .",
    "the vacuum naturally corresponding to these coordinates is not the same as , e.g , the bunch - davies vacuum .",
    "does the choice of one or the other affect the value of the imaginary part of the vacuum energy ?",
    "focusing now on the negative modes , we have both unanticipated modes that are present , and an expected mode that is absent .",
    "the former include the formally infinite family of @xmath234 oscillating modes that , unlike those associated with small bounces , can have sub - planckian eigenvalues . as with the corresponding small bounce modes , the fact that @xmath234 corresponds to the horizon fits well with the fact that the existence of the horizon plays a significant role in determining the nature of the transition governed by these bounces .",
    "also unanticipated are the oscillating negative modes with support on the bubble wall . in our analysis",
    "these appear when @xmath258 ; with the hamiltonian gauge choice used in refs .",
    "@xcite , they require the only slightly stronger condition that @xmath259 .",
    "we find these modes puzzling .",
    "the condition for their existence does not entail any unusually large local energy density . rather , the large circumference of the bounce , a nonlocal property , seems to be crucial .",
    "the expected mode that goes missing is the standard slowly varying mode corresponding to radial expansion or contraction of the bounce .",

    "going beyond the thin - wall approximation , our numerical results showed the mode deviating more and more from its expected form , eventually merging with the rapidly oscillating negative modes , as the bounce moved from type a toward type b.    is this a problem ? is it an indication that type b bounces do not correspond to vacuum transitions ?",
    "we think not .",
    "recall from the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ twarhobar ] ) that the type b regime is the one where @xmath109 , the energy density difference of the two vacua , is small or even zero .",
    "bubble nucleation certainly occurs for large positive @xmath109 , and we know that the thermal nature of de sitter spacetime allows the very same bounces to mediate tunneling upward ; i.e. , with large negative @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "continuity arguments then strongly suggest that tunneling with @xmath260 should also be possible",
    ". however , this tunneling need not be a decay . a single particle in a double - well potential can tunnel back and forth between two degenerate minima .",
    "the corresponding euclidean solution has no negative mode .",
    "perhaps the type b bounces should be understood as describing a finite system  the fields within a horizon volume  tunneling between two degenerate states .",
    "let us sum up briefly .",
    "we have investigated the negative mode problem of de sitter cdl bounces in a manner somewhat complementary to previous studies , with the goal of gaining physical insight into the various anomalies and pathologies associated with these modes .",
    "for the case of small bounces , we have found that the presence or absence of potential oscillating negative modes , as well as of the @xmath191 modes , depends on the value of @xmath261 .",
    "there are two regimes , which correspond to the two possible outcomes of de sitter vacuum decay  either a rapidly completed transition or eternal inflation .",
    "only the former goes over smoothly to the flat spacetime case , showing that the true weak gravity limit of bubble nucleation requires not only that the mass scales be well below the planck mass and the initial bubble radius much less than the horizon distance , but also that the characteristic time scale for nucleation be small compared to @xmath0 .    for large bounces , we found further evidence , confirming the indications from thin - wall arguments , that type b bounces do not have the usual expansion / contraction negative mode .",
    "we argued that , nevertheless , these bounces correspond to vacuum transitions . on the other hand ,",
    "the underlying physical origin of the oscillating negative wall modes that arise when the bounce is sufficiently large remain somewhat obscure .",
    "elucidating this issue is among the problems that remain to be resolved by future investigations .",
    "we are grateful for the hospitality of the korea institute for advanced study , where part of this research was performed .",
    "this work was supported in part by u.s .",

    "in this appendix we show that the the slices of the coleman - de luccia bounce that we identified in fig .",
    "[ cdl - bounce ] as giving the configurations at the beginning and end of tunneling are indeed horizon volumes .",
    "the o(4)-invariant euclidean metric can be written as @xmath262 the three - dimensional slices in which we are interested are given by @xmath263 , and either @xmath264 or @xmath265 , where @xmath266 is the location of the maximum of @xmath79 .",
    "this euclidean metric can be continued to a lorentzian one along the hypersurface @xmath263 by writing @xmath267 and going to real @xmath268 .",

    "the vanishing of @xmath270 at @xmath271 indicates the presence of a horizon , as claimed , and verifies that the two three - dimensional slices each correspond to a horizon volume in an instantaneously static metric .    in fact , because the bounce is a solution of the euclidean equations , we can use eq .",
