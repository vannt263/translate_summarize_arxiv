    "these massive clumps can migrate inwards via dynamical friction and coalesce with the central galaxy within a gyr time scale @xcite .",

    "diffuse extended emission  _ the extended emission accounts for 68% ( sfr  @xmath190  m@xmath7",

    "this is consistent with the finding by @xcite whose sed modeling required @xmath191 of the gas and dust to be outside the central kpc in order to account for the rest frame optical light .",
    "the extended structure may suggest a presence of a @xmath192  kpc star - bursting disk , or a massive starburst driven outflow from the central kpc . alternatively , the extended material can quickly cool and settle into a compact star - forming disk .",
    "the new alma data presented here suggests that the central region of some of the brightest unlensed smgs in the universe ( aztec1 and aztec8 ) are very compact ( @xmath193  kpc ) and contain at least two central clumps , forming stars near the eddington limit , with physical properties that are similar to the eastern nucleus of arp220 .",
    "aztec4 consists of two sources that are separated by @xmath5  kpc , indicating a mid - stage merger .",
    "in addition , we find that 68 ",
    "90% of the emission is distributed over @xmath13 kpc regions in all three sources .",
    "a major merger of two gas rich galaxies can explain the morphology and the physical properties seen in the central kpc of all three aztec sources .",
    "however , this scenario alone can not explain the large amount of extended emission .",
    "the extended structure with numerous clumps ( particularly for aztec1 ) is reminiscent of an isolated clumpy star forming disk model which is often invoked to explain the morphology and kinematics of high redshift star forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the characteristic sizes of these disks are a factor of 2 - 3 larger than the sizes of the aztec sources ( @xmath194  kpc ) . although the sample size used in this study is small , we suggest a hybrid scenario , i.e. a merging central ulirg surrounded by clumpy and extended star - bursting material , to be the favorable model here .",
    "the relative compactness of these sources supports the idea that these smgs will become the compact massive galaxies found at @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . alternatively , the extended material can quickly reform a disk , becoming a bulge dominated disk galaxy @xcite .",
