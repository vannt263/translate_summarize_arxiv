    "off - centered stellar isophotes are the defining signature of strong tidal interactions between elliptical galaxies , when the distance of approach is smaller than the characteristic size of the system . the off - centering results from the tidal deceleration of the outer stellar envelopes of each galaxy towards its partner , while stars near the galaxy centers have had time , due to their short ( @xmath62yr ) dynamical time scales , to average out the tidal effects and return to equilibrium ( madejsky et  al .",

    "1995 ) .",
    "a key feature that distinguishes gravitational interactions ( tides ) from gas - dynamical processes ( ram - pressure or turbulent - viscous stripping ) is that gravitational interactions act on both stars and gas , while gas - dynamical processes are ineffective at distorting the stellar distributions or velocities . from the bottom panel of figure [ fig : chandra ] , we see an enhanced ` bridge ' of x - ray emission , along the line ( oriented @xmath63 east of north ) connecting the galaxy centers .",
    "the ` bridge ' is closely correlated with the stellar distribution , as shown by the hst isophotes ( overlaid contour lines ) , and coincides with the direction of the north - south tidal distortions in the stellar isophotes .",
    "this suggests that the formation of the x - ray ` bridge ' is due in part to the same tidal interactions that disturbed the stars .",
    "emission in the ` bridge ' region is also likely partly due to projection effects from the superposition of the two galaxy isms caused by the closeness of the encounter .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness distribution has extended features that do not follow the stellar distribution , suggesting that hydrodynamical processes are important . in the top panel of figure",
    "[ fig : chandra ] , ngc  4783 shows a sharp surface brightness discontinuity ( edge ) on the eastern side of the galaxy , a @xmath64kpc long streamer or ` horn ' of gas swept back from the edge to the northwest , and a tail of enhanced x - ray emission , extending @xmath2kpc to the west , opposite ngc  4783 s ` leading ' edge .",
    "these features are similar to those predicted in numerical simulations of gas - dynamical stripping of elliptical galaxies due to their motion through the ambient igm ( stevens et  al .",
    "1999 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ; acreman et  al .  2003 ; heinz et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and to features seen in other elliptical galaxies undergoing ram - pressure and/or turbulent - viscous stripping .",
    "the leading edge - trailing tail morphology determines that ngc  4783 s motion in the plane of the sky is towards the east .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the relative galaxy motions from the simulations of borne et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) and madejsky et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , where ngc  4783 passes to the west of ngc  4782 at pericenter .",
    "the filamentary ` horn ' extending from the sharp edge of ngc  4783 is likely gas being stripped at the galaxy - igm interface .",
    "the twisted morphology of the bright inner regions of ngc  4783 s tail is reminiscent of von karman vortices seen in hydrodynamic fluid flows and produced in recent simulations of ram pressure stripping of disk galaxies ( roediger et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "an asymmetric ` fan ' of x - ray emission extends to the east - northeast of ngc  4782 , overlapping in projection the bend in the eastern radio jet ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cavity ] ) , while less x - ray emission is observed to the southwest .",
    "however , identifying the dominant processes responsible for the origin of the fan is complex .",
    "madejsky ( 1992 ) found a sharp increase in the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath65 from ngc  4782 , in the base of the fan , indicating the strong influence of tidal forces on matter ( gas and stars ) in the region . the compression wave produced by the high speed passage of the companion galaxy ngc4783 from the west to the northeast of ngc  4782 would displace the ism outside the core of ngc  4782 to the east relative to ngc  4782 s stellar distribution , as is seen .",
    "similar bulk motions , on larger scales , have been shown to occur in icm gas in merging clusters ( ascasibar & markevitch 2006 ) . any small velocity of ngc  4782 relative to the group potential and ambient igm , induced by the tidal interaction of the galaxy pair , also would contribute to the hydrodynamical displacement of the gas .",

    "4783 passes supersonically from southwest to east past ngc  4782 , tidal interactions distort the spatial and velocity distributions of stars and gas in and between the galaxies .",
    "in addition , the compression wave produced in the igm by ngc  4783 s high speed passage through the group gas impacts ngc  4782 s ism , displacing it to the east relative to the stellar isophotes and creating the ` fan ' .",
    "these bulk gas velocities , perhaps aided by a small tidally - induced oscillation of ngc  4782 relative to the center of the group s gravitational potential , provide the ram - pressure needed to bend the radio jets .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that understanding the hydrodynamical interactions between dumbbell galaxies and their surrounding gas environment , as revealed by x - ray observations , plays a critical role in constraining the interaction kinematics of these systems and in modeling their evolution in groups , as well as in richer cluster environments .",
    "in this paper we have used the results of a @xmath0ks _ chandra _ x - ray observation of the dumbbell galaxies ngc  4782 and ngc  4783 to measure the thermodynamic properties of hot gas in and surrounding the interacting system and have compared our results with new @xmath49 and @xmath50ghz vla maps of the dumbbell .",
    "we then used these properties to constrain the kinematics of the interaction and models for the bending of the radio jets associated with host galaxy ngc  4782 .",
    "we find the following :    * in the interaction region close to the two galaxies , the x - ray emission is highly asymmetric , showing features characteristic of both tidal and gas - dynamical stripping .",
    "ngc  4783 possesses a sharp leading surface - brightness edge @xmath422kpc east of its center and a @xmath2kpc tail extending to the west , characteristic of ram pressure stripping , and fixing the direction of motion of ngc  4783 in the plane of the sky to be from west to east .",
    "* the temperature , density , and pressure ratios between gas inside ngc  4783 s leading edge and undisturbed igm gas in front of ngc  4783 indicate that ngc  4783 is moving at velocity @xmath423kms@xmath4(mach @xmath5 ) with respect to the group gas . assuming a radial velocity of @xmath329kms@xmath4 ( ngc  4782 radially at rest with respect to the igm )",
    ", we find an inclination angle for ngc  4783 s motion of @xmath424 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "this is in agreement with the binary orbital parameters of madejsky & bien ( 1993 ) found by fitting tidal distortions in the stellar isophotes and velocities .",
    "*   a tidal bridge of x - ray emission extends along the line between the centers of ngc  4782 and ngc  4783 , and a fan of x - ray emission extends to the east of ngc  4782 .",
    "hot gas in the central regions of both galaxies is well fit by single temperature apec models with @xmath425kev , while the tail and bridge temperatures are higher ( @xmath426kev ) .",
    "the ` fan ' to the east of ngc  4782 is composed of cool ( @xmath380kev ) galaxy gas . the brightest x - ray emission in the fan is near the base of the eastern radio lobe . *   outside the interaction region , the x - ray surface brightness of the group igm is approximately spherically symmetric and nearly isothermal with mean temperature @xmath199kev .",
    "the igm surface brightness is well fit by a power law density distribution @xmath427@xmath93 with @xmath171 , centered on ngc  4782 .",
    "however , the data suggest that close to the interaction region , at about the radii of the radio lobes ( @xmath428kpc ) , the mean gas temperature to the west of the dumbbell is higher ( @xmath429kev ) than the gas temperature to the east ( @xmath430kev ) .",
    "we find the group x - ray luminosity and total mass within a radius of @xmath224kpc of ngc  4782 s center to be @xmath431)ergss@xmath4 and @xmath432 , respectively . using the m - t relation from finoguenov et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we estimate a total mass ( at @xmath159 ) for the group of @xmath433 , consistent with the large ( @xmath215kms@xmath4 ) galaxy velocity dispersion measured for the group as a whole .",
    "x - ray morphology and gas temperatures at @xmath210kpc favor the interaction picture in which the elliptical galaxy ngc  4783 is infalling for the first time into a single massive group with ngc  4782 nearly at rest at the center of the group potential .",
    "* there is a @xmath260 ( @xmath46 uncertainties ) reduction in the x - ray surface brightness in the region coincident with the eastern radio lobe of ngc  4782 , indicating the presence of an x - ray cavity .",
    "the observed x - ray surface brightness decrement suggests that the inclination angle of the eastern lobe is @xmath263 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "assuming relativistic plasma fills the lobe , the enthalpy carried in the cavity is @xmath403ergs .",
    "the age of the eastern cavity is @xmath434myr , and its kinetic power is @xmath408ergss@xmath4 .",
    "* the eastern radio jet of 3c278 bends sharply to the northeast at @xmath251kpc from the nucleus of ngc  4782 , inflating shortly thereafter into a roughly spherical lobe of radius @xmath253kpc , coincident with the x - ray cavity .",
    "the western jet extends straight @xmath255kpc before flaring into an ellipsoidal lobe that bends gradually to the northwest .",
    "the minimum radio pressures in the eastern and western jets are @xmath364 and @xmath365ergs@xmath93 , respectively , and @xmath367ergs@xmath93 in each of the lobes .",
    "these equipartition pressures are within factors @xmath106 of the pressures of the surrounding hot igm gas .",
    "* x - ray knots are found at the end of the eastern inner radio jet and in the western inner radio jet , coincident with peaks in the @xmath50ghz radio emission , and are likely associated with deceleration of the radio plasma . *",
    "a ulx with @xmath435ergss@xmath4is found near ngc  4782 s nucleus .",
    "*   assuming a light , mildly relativistic jet , ram pressure velocities of @xmath421kms@xmath4are sufficient to produce the observed bending in the eastern jet . assuming no intrinsic jet sidedness and an oblate 3-dimensional geometry for the western lobe",
    ", we find the ram pressure velocity of the igm relative to the western lobe to be @xmath419kms@xmath4with a factor of order @xmath436 uncertainty .",
    "these velocities may reflect bulk motions established in the gas during the galaxies high velocity encounter , with a possible additional small contribution caused by the oscillation of ngc  4782 with respect to the group potential , also induced by the tidal interaction of the galaxy pair .",
