    "in the one - dimensional domany - kinzel automaton ( dkca)@xcite the state @xmath1 of site @xmath2 at time @xmath3 depends on @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 ) . of the conditional probabilities",
    "@xmath6 the independent ones are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "all sites are updated simultaneously in the process .",
    "the phase diagram of the dkca in the @xmath10 plane , exhibits a line of ( second order ) critical points of directed percolation universality class , which line ends at the so called compact directed percolation point ( cdp ) .",
    "this point is situated on the line @xmath11,@xmath12 at @xmath13 . by crossing this point ( changing the sign of @xmath14 )",
    "the transition is a first order one between two ordered phases ( empty and full or , equivalently , using the spin variable @xmath15 , all spins up and all spins down ) .",
    "the characteristic critical exponents of the cdp transition are known exactly and a hyperscaling relation has also been derived for such transitions in d dimensions @xcite . for the spreading process of a single @xmath16 in the sea of zeros the exponents @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined at the transition point for the power - law time - dependences of the density of @xmath20 s @xmath21 , the survival probability @xmath22 and the mean square distance of spreading @xmath23",
    "have been obtained as @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath20 , respectively @xcite .",
    "( in the following subscript @xmath26 refers to spins for all the quantities . without subscript the corresponding quantity for kinks",
    "is meant , except for @xmath27 ) . for the parallel(time - direction ) and perpendicular(space - direction ) coherence lengths @xmath28 and @xmath29 resp . , as well as for the dynamical critical exponent",
    "@xmath30 domany and kinzel has obtained the exact results : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively ( which means only two exponents as by definition @xmath34 ) .",
    "the above mentioned hyperscaling law @xcite @xmath35 is fulfilled with the above exponents .",
    "more generally , dickman and tretyakov argue , that eq.([eq : hy ] ) is valid at first order transitions and it should apply to cases , whenever power - law growth produces compact colonies , developing from single seeds . in ref.@xcite compactness is clearly defined : it is meant that the density of colonies in surviving samples remains finite for @xmath36 .",
    "it is obvious , that the above sketched @xmath0 dimensional cdp transition is equivalent to that in the 1-d ( ferromagnetic ) glauber - ising model @xcite at @xmath37,because the symmetry as well as the kinetics are the same . changing the parameter @xmath38 of the dkca around @xmath13 corresponds to introducing a magnetic field @xmath39 into the spin - flip probability @xmath40 of the glauber - ising model ( section ii . ) and changing its sign .    on the basis of this equivalence it is of some interest to investigate the same spreading problem in the framework of the nonequilibrium generalization @xcite of the kinetic ising model ( nekim ) ( section iii . ) , where , in some range of its parameters , there is a continuous transition between a single - domain and a multidomain state .",
    "the order parameter of this transition is the density of kinks .",
    "the critical fluctuations of this so called parity conserving ( pc ) transition @xcite . have pronounced effect on the underlying spin system , as was found earlier by the authors @xcite both in case of static and dynamic exponents _ in situations of quenching from @xmath41 _ ( random initial states ) .",
    "these investigations will now be completed by studying , via numerical simulations , the spin spreading process at the pc point ( section iv ) .",
    "it is found that the characteristic exponents differ from those of the cdp transition , as could be expected , but still basic similarities remain .",
    "thus the transition which takes place upon changing the sign of the magnetic field is of first order and its exponents satisfy eq.([eq : hy ] ) .",
    "accordingly it can be termed as compact , and we will call it compact parity conserving transition ( cpc ) . the static magnetic critical exponent @xmath42 is also determined at the pc point .",
    "the @xmath43 ising model with glauber kinetics is exactly solvable . in this case",
    "the critical temperature is at @xmath37 , the transition is of first order .",
    "we recall that @xmath44 plays the role of @xmath45 in 1d and in the vicinity of @xmath37 critical exponents can be defined as powers of @xmath46 , thus e.g. that of the coherence length , @xmath27 , via @xmath47 . in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath39 , ( when the ising hamiltonian is given by @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , the magnetization is known exactly . at @xmath37 @xmath50 moreover ,",
    "for @xmath51 and @xmath52 the the exact solution reduces to @xmath53 in scaling form one writes : @xmath54 where @xmath42 is the static magnetic critical exponent .",
    "comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) and ( [ eq : m2 ] ) results in @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these values are the ones well known for the 1-d ising model .",
    "it is clear that the transition is discontinuous at @xmath57 also when changing @xmath39 from positive to negative values , see eq.([eq : sgh ] ) ( in the following the order of limits will always be meant as : 1 ) .",

    "the kinetics of the ising model in a magnetic field has been formulated by glauber@xcite . in its most general form",
    "the spin - flip transition rate for spin @xmath60 sitting at site @xmath2 is :    @xmath61    w_i = ( 1 + s_i-1s_i+1)(1 - 2s_i(s_i-1 + s_i+1 ) ) [ eq : wi ] where @xmath62 ( @xmath63 denoting the coupling constant in the ising hamiltonian ) , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are further parameters .",
    "this model will reach the same equilibrium state as the ising model in a magnetic field .    for the case @xmath66 , @xmath67 , which is usually referred to as the glauber - ising model",
    ", @xmath33 ( @xmath30 is the usual dynamic critical exponent ) is also a well - known result .",
    "the non - equilibrium generalization of the kinetic ising model to be used later on will be given a short review in the next section .",
    "in the nekim model , besides the spin - flip transition - rate eq.([eq : wi ] ) , taken at @xmath37 , also a nearest neighbour mixing of spins with probability @xmath68 is applied at each time step of the simulation .",
    "the spin - exchange transition rate of nearest neighbour spins ( the kawasaki@xcite rate at @xmath41 ) is @xmath69,$ ] where @xmath68 is the probability of spin exchange .",
    "spin - flip and spin - exchange are then applied alternately .",
    "the model was originally proposed and investigated for values @xmath70 at finite temperatures in @xcite .",
    "it is , however , at @xmath37 and for negative values of @xmath65 , that in this system a second order phase transition takes place@xcite for the _ kinks _ from an absorbing to an active state , which belongs to the parity conserving ( pc ) universality class .",
    "the order parameter is the density of kinks , at the pc point it decays in time as a power law @xmath71 , with @xmath72 .",
    "the absorbing phase is double degenerate , an initial state decays algebraically to the stationary state , which is one of the absorbing ones ( all spins up or all spins down , provided the initial state has an even number of kinks ) and the whole absorbing phase behaves like a critical point with power law decay of correlations , like the glauber - ising point ( @xmath66 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "now let us look at the pc transition from the point of view of the underlying spin system .",
    "the above mentioned first order transition at @xmath37 of the ising system disappears at the pc point and is , of course , absent in the whole active phase of the kinks .",
    "the fluctuations of this pc transition exert a pronounced effect on the underlying spin system as found earlier @xcite thus e.g. the the classical dynamical exponent @xmath30 , defined , as usual through the relaxation time @xmath74 of the magnetization , @xmath75 , was found to be @xmath76 instead of the glauber - ising value of @xmath33 . in this case one",
    "approaches the pc point from the temperature direction , by decreasing it to @xmath24 ( the effect of temperature is to create kink pairs inside of ordered spin - domains ) . on the other hand we can also look at the transition by changing a characteristic parameter ( chosen by us to be @xmath65 ) of nekim through the critical point @xmath77 and fixing the other two . as a function of @xmath78 the transition - on the level of spins - is again a first order one of type order - disorder .",
    "namely , taking initial states with an even number if kinks , the magnetization of the stationary state has a jump at @xmath79 .",
    "the same is true when changing the magnetic field @xmath80 from negative to positive values at @xmath81 .",
    "thus for the spins the value of the ( static ) critical exponent @xmath82 is zero , in all the three directions of departing from pc ( @xmath46 , @xmath83 and @xmath80 ) , as mentioned above .",
    "( for simulational results see @xcite ) .    in the following we will choose the same pc transition point as in previous works @xcite , and make simulations at and around this point by changing the magnetic field @xmath80 .",
    "the parameters chosen are : @xmath84 . in these previous simulations",
    "the spin - flip part has been applied using two - sublattice updating .",
    "after that we have stored the states of the spins and made l ( l is the size of the system ) random attempts of exchange using always the stored situation for the states of the spins before updating . all these together has been counted as one time - step of updating .",
    "( usual monte carlo update in this last step enhances the effect of @xmath68 and leads to @xmath85 ) .",
    "time - dependent simulations have proven to be a very efficient method for determining critical exponents ( besides the critical point itself)@xcite . on the basis of eq.([eq : m2 ] ) , the @xmath3-dependence of the magnetization in scaling form can be written as @xmath86 such form can be used in a quench from @xmath41 to @xmath87 and was exploited also in @xcite , though at @xmath88 , using temperature as a second variable , for determining mainly static critical exponents of the spins at the pc point .    in the following",
    "we will further study the influence of the pc transition on the spin system from a different point of view . instead of starting with an initial state of randomly distributed up- and down - spins with zero average magnetization as in the above mentioned simulations of quenching",
    ", we will now investigate the evolution of the nonequilibrium system from an almost perfectly magnetized initial state ( or rather an ensemble of such states ) .",
    "this state is prepared in such a way that a single up - spin is placed in the sea of down - spins at @xmath89 . using the language of kinks ( or particles , in the barw model@xcite ) , this corresponds to the usual initial state of two nearest neighbour kinks placed at the origin .",
    "the quantities usually measured of the forming clusters are the order - parameter density , the survival probability @xmath90 and the average mean square size of spreading @xmath91 from the center of the lattice . at the critical point",
    "these quantities exhibit power law behaviour in the limit of long times ; more generally we can write @xmath92 for the deviation of the spin density from its initial value , @xmath93 , @xmath94 for the survival probability and @xmath95 for the average mean square distance of spreading from the origin .",
    "the argument of the scaling functions above has been taken from eq.([eq : m3 ] ) ; but now at the pc point instead of the glauber - ising one .",
    "thus the exponents @xmath42 , @xmath27 and @xmath30 in the above equations take values appropriate at the pc point .",
    "we note here that the coherence length exponent @xmath27 appearing above is basically different from the @xmath96 and @xmath97 generally used in the context of dp transitions or in connection with the _ kinks _ in nekim .",
    "namely , @xmath98 with @xmath83 denoting the deviation from the pc point in the direction of the quantity driving the phase transition moreover , @xmath99 .",
    "z is independent of the abovementioned directions , characterizes solely the transition point , as it should be @xcite .",
    "we have measured @xmath100 and @xmath101 at and in the vicinity of the critical point with initial configuration of a single up - spin at the origin in the see of down - spins and allowing the system to evolve according to the rule of nekim as described above .",
    "averaging has been taken over runs with different sequences of random numbers during the evolution .",
    "[ fig2 ]    fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] show the local slopes ( for definition see e.g.@xcite ) @xmath18 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "as the survival probability must be the same for spins and kinks ( if the minority spin dies out , kinks also disappear and vice versa ) @xmath103 .",
    "the same applies also for the rms size of the cluster . as no result",
    "has been reported before for @xmath104 in the nekim model , exhibiting fig.[fig2 ] has its own merits .",
    "@xmath18 , however , is an independent new exponent .",
    "( besides results at the pc point we have also carried out detailed simulational studies at a point in the so called ising phase , namely for @xmath66 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this point is a non - equilibrium one due to the non - zero value of @xmath68 , and is marked on fig.[fig3 ] with ngi(non - equilibrium glauber - ising ) on the abscissa .",
    "the results which we have obtained via simulations at this point ( fig.[fig4 ] ) are , within error , the same as for the ( exactly solved ) glauber - ising case . )",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows the the asymptotic values for large times of @xmath107 , for different values of @xmath80 in the range of @xmath108 . for the exponent @xmath109 defined through @xmath110 the value",
    "@xmath111 has been obtained .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig7 ] show the scaling functions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) and ( [ eq : p ] ) , respectively .",
    "= 9.5 cm    = 9.5 cm    = 9.5 cm    here the best fit for the scaling - together of data with different values of @xmath80 could be achieved with @xmath112 , using the measured values @xmath113 ,",
    "@xmath114 , and that of @xmath115 from former studies , @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "= 9.5 cm    data for different values of @xmath80 scale together sufficiently well when considering the relatively poor statistics ( averages over @xmath117 samples , typically ) .",
    "the scaling law @xmath118 following from eq.([eq : p ] ) is satisfied with the above values of the exponents , within error .",
    "we note here that @xmath119 can be connected with @xmath120 , using in eq([eq : scaling ] ) @xmath121 and the definition of @xmath122 from ref.@xcite with the result : @xmath123 .",
    "the hyperscaling law for the spreading exponents was derived in its most general form by mendes et al .",
    "@xcite which we write here for the spin - quantities : @xmath124 in eq.([eq : mendes ] ) , in analogy with the spin cluster growth description at and in the vicinity of the cdp transition of the dkca @xcite , the above finite value of @xmath119 enters .",
    "( as explained in the introduction , @xmath125 of the dkca , with @xmath126 , corresponds to @xmath80 in the glauber - ising formulation ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 , which value follows near the pc point from the same symmetry consideration as at the glauber - ising point ( though does not in the active phase ) . here ,",
    "again , one should recall the above mentioned analogy between the dkca s",
    "variable @xmath127 and the variable @xmath80 in the present case . with",
    "the exponents obtained and summarised on table 1 eq.([eq : mendes ] ) is fulfilled . as already mentioned in the introduction , according to the argumentation of @xcite the fulfillment of the hyperscaling law in the above form is equivalent to compactness of the clusters . for illustration",
    "developing clusters are exhibited on fig.[fig8 ] under three conditions : a ) glauber case ( cdp in the dkca sense ) , b ) at the ngi point ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) where the kinetics is a non - equilibrium one ( @xmath128 ) and c ) at the pc point .",
    "it is apparent that the minority phase never develops inside of the majority one , moreover , the branching process present in the kinetics in cases b ) and c ) makes the fla pieces of cdp boundaries fringed .",
    "the results together with some of the critical exponents obtained earlier in @xcite are summarized in table i.    ._spin - cluster critical exponents for nekim in a magnetic field _ [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in summary , we have carried out numerical studies of the power law behaviour of spreading of spins , at the pc transition point of nekim ( where a second order transition occurs on the level of _ kinks _ ) .",
    "it has been found that the analogue of the domany - kinzel cdp transition - a first order transition upon changing the sign of an applied magnetic field - still exists .",
    "of the three exponents measured only @xmath42 , which is the static magnetic exponent of the ising model , was found to be unaffected by the critical fluctuations of the kinks within error .",
    "concerning other static ising exponents , this circumstance is not so natural , as e.g. the coherence length exponent is a counterexample ( see ref.@xcite and table 1 ) .",
    "consequently the relation @xmath56 valid in the glauber - ising case is no more fulfilled at the pc point .",
    "@xmath119 characterizing the level - off values of the survival probability of the spin clusters is a new ( static ) exponent ; @xmath42 and @xmath119 are connected by a scaling law . the third exponent , @xmath18 has proven to be numerically equal to @xmath103 thus ensuring that the hyperscaling law is fulfilled in a form appropriate for first order transitions and compact clusters @xcite",
