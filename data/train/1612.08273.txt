    "since in soft interactions the correlation length in rapidity @xmath73 , modifications of parton densities related to the merging of the two ladders should be rather local in the rapidity and located close to the rapidity position of the vertex describing the @xmath74 [ @xmath75 transition .",

    "above we discussed the dynamical model of shadowing and antishadowing originating from an exchange of two ladders belonging to two different nucleons of the nucleus , which exhausts the answer in the cases of low nuclear density and the deuteron . in a general case , one needs to take into account the interaction with @xmath41 nucleons of the nucleus , which can be done using the quasi - eikonal approximation with the effective cross section @xmath76 , see eq .",

    "we discussed in the introduction that in the gluon channel , the small @xmath2 shadowing effect should be supplemented by the effect of antishadowing , which peaks at intermediate @xmath2 ( @xmath77 ) . to constrain the gluon antishadowing , one can use the momentum sum rule for nuclear pdfs : @xmath78 where the sum runs over all flavors @xmath22 ; @xmath79 is the rescaled bjorken @xmath2 ( @xmath80 ) , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the four - momenta of the virtual photon and the nucleus , respectively ; @xmath83 is the momentum fraction of a fast moving nucleus carried by equivalent photons , which is of the order of a fraction of the percent for heavy nuclei  @xcite .    nuclear modifications of",

    "<S> we explore the theoretical observation that within the leading twist approximation , the nuclear effects of shadowing and antishadowing in non - perturbative nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) at the input qcd evolution scale involve diffraction on nucleons of a nuclear target and originate from merging of two parton ladders belonging to two different nucleons , which are close in the rapidity space . </S>",
    "<S> it allows us to propose that for a given momentum fraction @xmath0 carried by the diffractive exchange , nuclear shadowing and antishadowing should compensate each other in the momentum sum rule for nuclear pdfs locally on the interval @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we realize this by constructing an explicit model of nuclear gluon antishadowing , which has a wide support in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , peaks at @xmath4 at the level of @xmath5% for @xmath6pb at @xmath7 gev@xmath8 and rather insignificantly depends on details of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the impact parameter @xmath9 dependence of antishadowing and found it to be slow . </S>"
