    "dwarf novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variables that consist of a white dwarf primary with an accretion disk and a roche - lobe - filling late type secondary star ( for a review , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type stars are a subclass of dwarf novae exhibiting two types of outburst : normal outbursts lasting for a few days and superoutbursts for weeks , during which @xmath1 0.2 mag modulations called superhumps are always observed .",
    "many models have been proposed in order to explain outbursting properties for su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the most promising one is the thermal - tidal instability model ( for a review , see @xcite ) that is also supported by observations .",
    "most cataclysmic variables below the period gap are believed to evolve towards short orbital periods due to gravitational - wave radiation .",
    "minimum of the orbital period of cvs ( usually referred to as _ period minimum _ ) has been proposed to be around 65 min @xcite .",
    "it is expected that near the period minimum , where the secondary begins to degenerate , the inversion of mass - radius relation causes the orbital period to become longer with evolution .",
    "some authors claim that wz sge - type dwarf novae , which is a subtype of su uma - type dwarf novae , may have experienced the inversion ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that the most of cvs below the period gap continue the above mentioned standard evolutional sequence .",
    "recently , theory predicts another evolutional sequence for cvs ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "given a certain range of mass for the primary and the secondary , the secondary does not become fully convective in its interior , which leads the secondary to have perpetual magnetic braking even below the period gap . as a consequence ,",
    "the orbital period can become shorter than even the theoretical period minimum .",
    "am cvn stars @xcite , whose orbital periods are less than 60 min , are the most promising systems that experienced the aforementioned scenario .",
    "ei psc (= 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and v485 cen @xcite may be possible candidates for the progenitor of am cvn stars .",
    "sdss j013701.06 - 091234.9 ( hereafter j0137 ) was first identified as a cataclysmic variable by @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy for j0137 showed double - peaked h@xmath2 profiles , as well as tio bands .",
    "radial velocity studies exhibited a periodicity of 84 min .",
    "an eruption of j0137 had been only recorded by the all sky automated survey @xcite as asas 013701 - 0912.6 until the 2003 december outburst was caught .",
    "the first recorded data showed that the object brightened up to 12.6 in @xmath3 band on 2001 may 27 , then gradually faded down to 13.4 on june 9 , 2001 , and finally became below the detection limit on june 20 , 2001 .",
    "as inferred from the duration of the brightening , the recorded brightening strongly suggested a superoutburst of su uma - type dwarf novae .    during quiescent photmetric observations of j0137 , @xcite serendipitously discovered a brightening of the object up to @xmath4 mag on dec .",

    "a linear regression of the superhump maximum timings yielded the following equation :    @xmath13    the obtained @xmath14 diagram is demonstrated in figure 6 , where the dashed line denotes the beginning of late superhumps discussed in @xcite .",
    "the data can be apparently fitted by a quadratic function . however , considering the argument by @xcite , in which they have enough data to explore superhump period changes during the later stage of the outburst , the break in figure 6 is caused by a sudden jump of phase as seen in some su uma - type dawrf novae .",
    "thus we conclude that , except the phase change on hjd 2453007 , presumably due to late superhumps , there were almost no changes in superhump periods during the present superoutburst .",
    "the overall light curves provided firm evidence of superhumps , which allows us to identify the object as a new su uma - type dwarf nova .",
    "the obtained superhump period is 0.056686 ( 12 ) d , one of the shortest superhump periods among su uma - type dwarf novae ever known .",
    "the plateau stage lasted more than 2 weeks , and a rebrightening took place at least once after the termination of the plateau stage .",
    "the amplitude of the object exceeded 6 mag , and the light curve of j0137 has similarity to that of the 1998 superoutburst of wx cet @xcite and that of 1996 superoutburst of sw uma @xcite in terms of the decline rate , a duration of the plateau stage , and an outburst amplitude .",
    "this certifies j0137 as a large amplitude su uma - type dwarf nova ( toads , @xcite ) .",
    "it had been considered that superhump periods of su uma - type dwarf novae decrease with time . however , since the 1995 superoutburst of al com , some objects have been confirmed to increase the superhump period with time .",
    "such systems include al com @xcite , v485 cen @xcite , eg cnc ( @xcite , @xcite ) , sw uma ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , v1028 cyg @xcite , wx cet @xcite , hv vir ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , rz leo @xcite , v592 cas @xcite , wz sge @xcite , ei psc @xcite , v1141 aql @xcite , ks uma @xcite , vw crb @xcite , tv crv @xcite , go com @xcite , and asas 002511 + 121712 ( imada et al . in prep . ) .",
    "a decrease of superhump period was interpreted as being due to shrinkage of the disk radius , or a natural consequence of mass depletion from the disk @xcite .",
    "most of su uma - type dwarf novae having orbital periods below 0.063 d tend to increase the superhump period as time elapses @xcite .",
    "j0137 , having the orbital period of 0.0553 d , is expected to be a dwarf nova with positive derivative of the superhump period .",
    "however , our results clearly indicate that the superhump period hardly changed during the first half of the plateau stage .",
    "@xcite suggested that the period increase may be correlated to a low mass ratio and/or a low mass transfer rate , which is supported by recent observations @xcite .",
    "however , ei psc and rz leo obviously violate the kato s suggestion ( @xcite;@xcite ) ; spectroscopic observations have revealed a relatively high mass transfer rate and a high mass ratio of these objects .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered that an su uma - type dwarf nova , tv crv exhibits two types of the superhump period change : positive @xmath15= @xmath16/@xmath17 during the 2001 superoutburst without a precursor and almost no changes @xmath18 during the 2004 superoutburst with a precursor .",
    "@xcite suggests that this difference mainly depends on the disk radius before a superoutburst is triggered . at the beginning of an outburst ,",
    "if the accretion disk has large masses beyond the 3:1 resonance radius at which an eccentric mode originates , the mode sufficiently propagates outward because of the plenty matter beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , so that the outer region of the accretion disk becomes more eccentric , leading to the positive @xmath18 .",
    "j0137 , when based on the arguments by @xcite , was likely to have insufficient mass at the ignition of the outburst . as a consequence ,",
    "an eccentric mode could not propagate so far as other su uma - type dwarf novae exhibiting positive @xmath18 .",
    "the validity of uemura s arguments should be explored in the future observations for su uma - type dwarf novae with short orbital periods , and should be tested by hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "if the orbital period of the system and the maximum @xmath3 magnitude of a normal outburst are known , one can roughly estimate the distance to the object . in this subsection",
    ", we try to estimate the distance to j0137 in the same manner as that used by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an empirical relation derived by @xcite is that the absolute @xmath3 magnitude at the maximum is the function of the orbital period of the object , that is ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the orbital period in the unit of hour .",
    "this relation , however , can adapt only to a low inclination system , at most , to an intermediate inclination system . in the case of j0137 , we need caution to use the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "first , although equation ( 2 ) should be used to the maximum magnitude of a normal outburst of su uma stars , a normal outburst has not been observed for j0137 .",
    "second , spectroscopic observations of j0137 @xcite shows doubly - peaked profile of h@xmath2 , implying an intermediate or high inclination .",
    "for the first caution , we used that the magnitude of a normal outburst is 0.5@xmath00.5 mag fainter than that of a superoutburst .",
    "for the second caution , the absence of an eclipse can rule out the possibility of a high inclination system of j0137 .",
    "thus , substituting 1.3283 ( hr ) into p , we obtain @xmath21 @xmath22 5.3 . assuming the maximum magnitude of a normal outburst to be 12.7@xmath00.5 , we roughly derived 300@xmath080 pc as a likely distance .",
    "we further estimated a distance to j0137 from its proper motion .",
    "the proper motion of j0137 is listed in the usno b1.0 catalog as ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) = ( @xmath25 ) in the unit of mas . supposing the transverse velocity to be 100km / s @xcite , the distance to j0137 is estimated to be about 320 pc , which does not contradict that derived above .",
