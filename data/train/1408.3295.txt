    "this is also true for the @xmath99 oscillations in particular .",
    "\\(b ) the huge distinction between the values of @xmath68 and @xmath78 stems from the fact that @xmath98 and @xmath77 . at present",
    "it is impossible to decide between models * a * and * b * as well as to determine the value of @xmath48 exactly .",
    "so the values @xmath100 and @xmath101 yr are interpreted as the estimations from below ( conservative limit ) and from above , respectively .",
