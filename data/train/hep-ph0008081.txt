    "hep - ph/0008081 + desy 00 - 112    among the possible extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , supersymmetric ( susy ) theories have a variety of attractive features : they can solve the higgs hierarchy puzzle , break electroweak symmetry radiatively at low energies , and explain the unification of gauge couplings at a high energy scale . a necessary condition for these arguments to be valid",
    "is that susy is realized in the region of the electroweak scale .",
    "this makes the search for supersymmetry one of the most important tasks at future high - energy collider experiments .",
    "if susy is realized at the electroweak scale , most of the susy partners of the sm particles will be discovered at the high center - of - mass energies available at the next generation of hadron colliders , _",
    "i.e. _ at run ii of the fermilab tevatron or at the cern lhc . after this discovery stage it will be important to analyze the properties of these sparticles and to check whether they have the correct quantum numbers to be partners of the sm particles .",
    "while hadron colliders have the advantage of large available center - of - mass energy , they also have serious disadvantages : first they produce enormous backgrounds from sm processes making it difficult to distinguish the signal from the background .",
    "second , the remnants of the initial hadrons make it impossible to reconstruct the full final state .",
    "third , the energies of the partons initiating the hard scattering are unknown so that an energy ( mass ) scan becomes impossible .    in @xmath0 annihilation , the full center - of - mass energy participates in the hard scattering and is precisely known , and the final state consists of a small number of high - energetic particles .",
    "the precision studies following upon the susy discovery stage are therefore the natural domain of high - energy lepton colliders .",
    "important information on the susy parameters can be gained from the susy mass spectrum : it will be important to know whether all sfermions , squarks and sleptons , or those of the same generation have identical mass parameters and/or gauge couplings or how large the differences and ratios among them are , or how much the left- and right - handed squarks or sleptons are mixed @xcite .    currently several linear @xmath0 colliders in the 500 - 3000 gev center - of - mass energy range are under design in various international collaborations . from previous experience with existing lepton colliders like lep2",
    "it is well - known that photons will be ubiquitous at future lepton colliders due to bremsstrahlung and beamstrahlung effects .",
    "furthermore it has been proposed to backscatter laser photons from the lepton beams in order to build a collider with high - energetic and almost monochromatic photon beams @xcite .",
    "photon colliders have similar advantages as lepton colliders : in energy scans the initial photon energy is known , although only to @xmath1 , and the final state can be completely reconstructed .",
    "sfermion production in photon collisions has been considered previously either with bremsstrahlung photons @xcite or with laser photons , where the center - of - mass energy dependence for fixed sfermion mass was analyzed in @xcite and the sfermion mass dependence for a fixed collider energy of 1 tev in .",
    "the production of bound squarkonium states was considered in @xcite for bremsstrahlung photons and in @xcite for photon colliders .    in this paper",

    "only part of the initial photon energy participates in the hard scattering .",

    "this is due to the absence of the four - point interaction diagram in fig.[fig : dlo ] which contributes only for identical helicities at intermediate @xmath141 .",
    "these features should be very helpful in experimental analyses .",
    "similar results for up - type squarks of mass 100 gev are shown in fig.[fig : sigma_1tev_100gev_pt ] .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_1tev_y2 ] rapidity distributions for up - type squarks of mass 100 gev produced at a 1 tev photon collider .",
    "the rapidity spectra are symmetric at @xmath145 and extend out to @xmath146 .",
    "this range should be covered by the detector at a photon collider to provide optimal analyzing conditions for sfermions of mass @xmath147 gev . for @xmath148",
    "gev the rapidity spectrum is narrower and extends out to @xmath149 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_1tev2_y2 ] ) .",
    "the spectrum for laser photons with identical helicities is again very similar to the unpolarized spectrum .",
    "the spectrum for opposite helicities has interesting shoulders at @xmath150 in the case of @xmath151 gev .",
    "the dips at @xmath152 are again due to the absence of the four - point interaction diagram in fig.[fig : dlo ] for opposite helicities .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed analysis of sfermion production in photon - photon collisions .",
    "we have reviewed the unpolarized and polarized photon spectra coming from bremsstrahlung , beamstrahlung , and laser backscattering and updated them using the latest linear collider design parameters .",
    "we have calculated for the first time total and differential cross sections for sfermion production in photon - photon collisions , including contributions from resolved photons and arbitrary photon polarization .",
    "our numerical results have been compared directly to the competing @xmath0 annihilation cross section .",
    "we have chosen to present our results for the typical case of up - type squark production .",
    "the cross sections for down - type squarks and sleptons can easily be obtained by rescaling our results according to the sfermion charge and color factor .",
    "brems- and beamstrahlung photons will be produced naturally at any linear @xmath0 collider .",
    "our results show that the corresponding production cross sections are small , except at the very large center - of - mass energies envisaged in the clic design .",
    "the polarization of the initial photons remains small even if the initial lepton polarization is large .",
    "therefore polarization effects in brems- and beamstrahlung are of little interest",
    ".    a dedicated photon collider will require the construction of additional laser facilities at some extra cost .",
    "however , we have demonstrated that a photon collider may be advantageous for the analysis of sfermions for several reasons :    * in leading order of perturbation theory , photon - photon collisions are pure susy - qed processes , which depend only on the physical sfermion mass and not on the details of the susy breaking mechanism .",
    "any model dependence can therefore be analyzed cleanly in the decay of the sfermions . *",
    "the photon cross section is very sensitive to the sfermion charge so that sleptons , up - type , and down - type squarks can be clearly distinguished .",
    "* a photon collider can produce almost monochromatic photons , _",
    "i.e. _ photons which have about 83 % of the electron beam energy , and they can be highly polarized . as a consequence we find that the production cross sections are larger than those in @xmath0 annihilation for a large range of sfermion masses . if the incoming laser photons and leptons are polarized and the photons have identical helicities , this is even true up to the kinematic limit of the photon collider . for lower sfermion masses or higher center - of - mass energies the cross section can be improved by about 40 % by choosing opposite laser photon helicities .",
    "resolved photon processes are only important for squarks , since sleptons do not couple strongly .",
    "furthermore , resolved photons contribute significantly only at very small squark masses , which are experimentally already excluded .",
    "while there is thus no enhancement of the production cross section , there is also no uncertainty due to the photon structure or the scale of the strong coupling constant .",
    "differential cross sections are important for experimental analyses to distinguish signal from background events .",
    "we find that the @xmath141 spectrum for sfermion production in photon collisions peaks roughly at @xmath144 as expected .",
    "the rapidity spectrum for sfermions of mass @xmath151 gev at a 1 tev photon collider extends out to @xmath153 .",
    "we conclude that this should be the minimum coverage a detector at a photon collider should have to ensure full analyzing power .",
    "the polarized @xmath141 and @xmath124 spectra have very distinct features which should be helpful in the experimental analysis .",
