    "radial velocity and transit surveys , which primarily target main - sequence stars , have already discovered hundreds of giant planets and are now beginning to explore the reservoir of lower mass planets with orbit sizes extending to a few astronomical units ( au ) .",
    "these planets mostly lie well inside the snow line of their host stars .",
    "meanwhile , direct imaging with large aperture telescopes has been discovering giant planets tens to hundreds of aus away from their stars @xcite .",
    "the region of sensitivity of microlensing lies somewhere in between and extends to low - mass exoplanets lying beyond the snow - line of their low - mass host stars , between @xmath41 and 10 au .",
    "although there is already strong evidence that cold sub - jovian planets are more common than originally thought around low - mass stars , cold super - jupiters orbiting k or m - dwarfs were believed to be a rarer class of objects @xcite .",
    "both gravitational instability and core accretion models of planetary formation have a hard time generating these planets , although it is possible to produce them given appropriate initial conditions . the main argument against core accretion",
    "is that it takes too long to produce a massive planet but this crucially depends on the core mass and the opacity of the planet envelope during gas accretion . in the case of gravitational instability",
    ", a massive protoplanetary disc would probably have too high an opacity to fragment locally at distances of a few au .",
    "the radial velocity method has been remarkably successful in tabulating the part of the distribution that lies within the snow - line but discoveries of super - jupiters beyond the snow - line of m - dwarfs have been comparatively few @xcite . since microlensing is most sensitive to planets that are further away from their host stars , typically m and k dwarfs , the two techniques are complementary .",
    "three brown dwarf and nineteen planet microlensing discoveries have been published to date , including the discoveries of two multiple - planet systems @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that unbound objects of planetary mass have also been reported @xcite .",
    "microlensing involves the chance alignment along an observer s line of sight of a foreground object ( lens ) and a background star ( source ) .",
    "this results in a characteristic variation of the brightness of the background source as it is being gravitationally lensed .",
    "as seen from the earth , the brightness of the source increases as it approaches the lens , reaching a maximum value at the time of closest approach .",
    "the brightness then decreases again as the source moves away from the lens .",
    "in microlensing events , planets orbiting the lens star can reveal their presence through distortions in the otherwise smoothly varying standard single lens lightcurve .",
    "together , the host star and planet constitute a binary lens .",
    "binary lenses have a magnification pattern that is more complex than the single lens case due to the presence of extended caustics that represent the positions on the source plane at which the lensing magnification diverges .",
    "distortions in the lightcurve arise when the trajectory of the source star approaches ( or crosses ) the caustics @xcite .",
    "recent reviews of the method can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "upgrades to the ogle @xcite survey observing setup and moa @xcite microlensing survey telescope in the past couple of years brought greater precision and enhanced observing cadence , resulting in an increased rate of exoplanet discoveries .",
    "for example , ogle has regularly been monitoring the field of the ogle-2012-blg-0406 event since march 2010 with a cadence of 55 minutes . when a microlensing alert was issued notifying the astronomical community that event ogle-2012-blg-0406 was exhibiting anomalous behavior , intense follow - up observations from multiple observatories around the world",
    "were initiated in order to better characterize the deviation .",
    "this event was first analyzed by @xcite using exclusively the ogle - iv survey photometry .",
    "that study concluded that the event was caused by a planetary system consisting of a 3.9@xmath51.2 @xmath6 planet orbiting a low mass late k / early m dwarf .",
    "in this paper we present the analysis of the event based on the combined data obtained from 10 different telescopes , spread out in longitude , providing dense and continuous coverage of the lightcurve .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : details of the discovery of this event , follow - up observations and image analysis procedures are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 presents the methodology of modeling the features of the lightcurve .",
    "we provide a summary and conclude in section 4 .",

    "the event had a baseline @xmath7-band magnitude of 16.35 and was gradually increasing in brightness .",

    "this process chain did not involve any human interaction at all .",
    "the first human involvement was an e - mail circulated to all microlensing teams by v.  bozza on the 2@xmath14 of july ( 07:26 ut ) informing the community about the ongoing anomaly and modeling results . including ogle data from a subsequent night , the apparent anomaly was also independently spotted by e.  bachelet ( e - mail by d.p .",

    "however , when the rapidly changing features of the anomaly were independently assessed by the chungbuk national university group ( cbnu , c. han ) , the community was informed on the 5@xmath12 of july ( 10:43 ut ) that the anomaly is very likely due to the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "an independent modeling run by v.  bozza s automatic software ( 5@xmath12 of july , 10:55 ut ) confirmed the result . while the ogle collaboration ( a. udalski ) notified observers on the 5@xmath12 of july that a caustic exit was occurring , a geometry leading to a further small peak successively emerged from the models .",

    "another modeling run performed at cbnu on the 7@xmath12 of july ( 02:39 ut ) also identified this feature and estimated that the secondary peak would occur on the 11@xmath12 of july .",
    "follow - up teams continued to monitor the progress of the event intensively until the beginning of september , well after the planetary deviation had ceased , and provided dense coverage of the main peak of the event .",
    "a preliminary model using available ogle and follow - up data at the time , circulated on the 31@xmath13 of october ( c. han , j .- y .",

    "@xcite presented an analysis of this event using reprocessed survey data exclusively . in this paper",
    "we present a refined analysis using survey and follow - up data together .",
    "the groups that contributed to the observations of this event , along with the telescopes used , are listed in table  [ table : one ] .",
    "most observations were obtained in the @xmath7-band and some images were also taken in other bands in order to create a color - magnitude diagram and classify the source star .",
    "we note that there are also observations obtained from the moa 1.8 m survey telescope which we did not include in our modeling because the target was very close to the edge of the ccd .",
    "we also do not include data from the @xmath8fun auckland 0.4 m , pest 0.3 m , possum 0.36 m and turitea 0.36 m telescopes due to poor observing conditions at site .",
    "extracting accurate photometry from observations of crowded fields , such as the galactic bulge , is a challenging process .",
    "each image contains thousands of stars whose stellar point - spread functions ( psfs ) often overlap so aperture and psf - fitting photometry can at best offer limited precision . in order to optimize the photometry it is necessary to use difference imaging ( di ) techniques @xcite . for any particular telescope / camera combination ,",
    "di uses a reference image of the event taken under optimal seeing conditions which is then degraded to match the seeing conditions of every other image of the event taken from that telescope .",
    "the degraded reference image is then subtracted from the matching image to produce a residual ( or difference ) image .",
    "stars that have not varied in brightness in the time interval between the two images will cancel , leaving no systematic residuals on the difference image but variable stars will leave either a positive or negative residual .",
    "di is the preferred method of photometric analysis among microlensing groups and each group has developed custom pipelines to reduce their observations .",
    "ogle and moa images were reduced using the pipelines described in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "planet , @xmath8fun , and wise images were processed using variants of the pysis @xcite pipeline , whereas robonet and mindstep observations were analyzed using customized versions of the dandia package @xcite .",
    "once the source star returned to its baseline magnitude , each data set was reprocessed to optimize photometric precision .",
    "these photometrically optimized data sets were used as input for our modeling run .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the lightcurve of ogle-2012-blg-406 .",
    "the lightcurve displays two main features that deviate significantly from the standard paczyski curve .",
    "the first feature , which peaked at hjd @xmath4 2456112 ( 3@xmath15 of july ) , is produced by the source trajectory grazing the cusp of a caustic .",
    "the brightness then quickly drops as the source moves away from the cusp , increases again for a brief period as it passes close to another cusp at hjd @xmath4 2456121 ( 12@xmath12 of july ) , and eventually returns to the standard shape as the source moves further away from the caustic structure .",
    "the anomalous behavior , when both features are considered , lasts for a total of @xmath4 15 days , while the full duration of the event is @xmath16120 days .",
    "these are typical lightcurve features expected from lensing phenomena involving planetary lenses .",

    "the binary nature of the lens requires the introduction of three extra parameters : the mass ratio @xmath22 between the two components of the lens , their projected separation @xmath21 , expressed in units of @xmath33 , and the source trajectory angle @xmath24 with respect to the axis defined by the two components of the lens .",
    "a seventh parameter , @xmath34 , representing the source radius normalized by the angular einstein radius is also required to account for finite - source effects that are important when the source trajectory approaches or crosses a caustic @xcite .",

    "even small changes in these parameters can produce extreme changes in magnification as they may result in the trajectory of the source approaching or crossing a caustic @xcite . on the other hand , changes in the other parameters cause the overall magnification pattern to vary smoothly .    to assess how the magnification pattern depends on the parameters , we start the modeling run by performing a hybrid search in parameter space whereby we explore a grid of @xmath36 values and optimize @xmath37 and @xmath34 at each grid point by @xmath17 minimization using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",

    "specifically , the mass of the host star derived in @xcite is 0.59 @xmath90 , which is @xmath4 34% greater than our estimate .",
    "half of this difference comes from the slightly larger einstein radius obtained by @xcite from the ogle - iv photometry and the remaining part from the slightly larger @xmath27 component of the parallax obtained from modeling the survey and follow - up photometry as presented in this paper .",
    "it should be noted that the parameters derived by both our and the@xcite models are consistent within the 1-@xmath91 level .    to further check the consistency between our model and that of @xcite",
    ", we conducted additional modeling based on different combinations of data sets .",
    "we first test a model based on ogle data exclusively in order to see whether we can retrieve the physical parameters reported in @xcite . from this modeling",
    ", we derive physical parameters consistent with those of @xcite , indicating that the differences are due to the additional coverage provided by the follow - up observations .",
    "we conducted another modeling run using ogle observations but also included ctio , fts and saao data , i.e. those datasets covering the anomalous peak .",
    "this modeling run resulted in physical parameters that are consistent with the values extracted from fitting all combined data together , as reported in this paper .",
    "this indicates that the differences between @xcite and this analysis , although consistent within the 1-@xmath91 level , come mainly from follow - up data that provide better coverage of the perturbation .",
    "therefore , using survey and follow - up data together , we arrive at a more accurate determination of the @xmath92 and @xmath27 parameters , which leads to a refinement of the physical parameters of the planetary system .",
    "microlensing event ogle-2012-blg-0406 was intensively observed by survey and follow - up groups using 10 different telescopes around the world .",
    "anomalous deviations observed in the lightcurve were recognized to be due to the presence of a planetary companion even before the event reached its central peak . the anomalous behavior was first identified and assessed automatically via software agents .",
    "most follow - up teams responded to these alerts by adjusting their observing strategies accordingly .",
    "this highlights the importance of circulating early models to the astronomical community that help to identify important targets for follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath4100 follow - up alerts circulated annually , @xmath410% of which turn out to be planet candidates .",
    "our analysis of the combined data is consistent with the results of @xcite and we report the refined parameters of the system .",
    "we find that this refinement is mainly due to follow - up observations over the anomaly . the primary lens with mass @xmath79   @xmath80 is orbited by a planetary companion with mass @xmath81  @xmath6 at a projected separation of @xmath82  au .",
    "the distance to the system is @xmath78  kpc in the direction of the galactic bulge .",
    "this is the fourth cold super - jupiter planet around a low - mass star discovered by microlensing and the first such system whose characteristics were derived solely from microlensing data , without considering any external information .",
    "microlensing is currently the only way to obtain high precision mass measurements for this type of system .",
    "radial velocity , in addition to the @xmath93 degeneracy , at present does not have long enough data streams to measure the parameters of such systems .",
    "however , recently @xcite have developed a promising new method to discover them using a combination of radial velocity and direct imaging .",
    "they identify long term trends in radial velocity data and use adaptive optics imaging to rule out the possibility that these are due to stars .",
    "this means that the trends are either due to large planets or brown dwarfs",
    ". this approach does not yield precise characterization but provides important statistical information .",
    "their results are consistent with gravitational microlensing estimates of planet abundance in that region of parameter space .",
    "the precise mechanism of how such large planets form and evolve around low mass stars is still an open question .",
    "radial velocity and transit surveys have been finding massive gas - giant planets around fgk - stars for years @xcite but these stars have protoplanetary disks that are sufficiently massive to allow the formation of super - jupiter planets .",
    "on the other hand , protoplanetary disks around m - dwarfs have masses of only a few jupiter mass so massive gas giants should be relatively hard to produce @xcite .",
    "recent observational studies have revealed that protoplanetary disks are as common around low mass stars as higher - mass stars , arguing for the same formation processes .",
    "in addition , there is mounting evidence , but not yet conclusive , that disks last much longer around low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "longer disk lifetimes may be conducive to the formation of super - jupiters .",
    "the microlensing discoveries suggest that giant planets around low - mass stars may be as common as around higher - mass stars but may not undergo significant migration @xcite .",
    "simulations using the core accretion formalism can produce such planets within reasonable disk lifetimes of a few myr provided the core mass is sufficiently large or the opacity of the planet envelope during gas accretion is decreased by assuming that the dust grains have grown to larger sizes than the typical interstellar values ( r. nelson , private communication ) . furthermore , gravitational instability models of planet formation can also potentially produce such objects when the opacity of the protoplanetary disk is low enough to allow local fragmentation at greater distances from the host star , and subsequently migrating the planet to distances of a few au .",
    "it is worth noting that highly magnified microlensing events involving extended stellar sources may produce appreciable polarization signals @xcite . if such signals are observed during a microlensing event , they can be combined with photometric observations to place further constraints on the lensing geometry and physical properties of the lens .",
