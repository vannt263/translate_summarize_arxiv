    "one of the most striking features of nucleus - nucleus collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) is the collective flow . in recent years",
    "this phenomenon has been a subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies@xcite .",
    "it is believed that the medium produced in nucleus - nucleus collsions at rhic equilibrates efficiently and builds up a flow field .",
    "gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering of an energetic parton propagating in a dense medium leads to induced parton energy loss or jet quenching . as discovered in high - energy heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "jet quenching is manifested in both the suppression of single inclusive hadron spectrum at high transverse momentum @xmath2 region@xcite and the disappearance of the typical back - to - back jet structure in dihadron correlations@xcite .",
    "extentive theoretical investigation of jet quenching has been widely carried out in recent years@xcite .",
    "most of the jet quenching theory research are studied in a static medium based on the static color - screened yukawa potential proposed by gyulassy and wang@xcite . however , the medium is not static , the collective flow need to be considered@xcite .",
    "later , the interaction between the jet and the target partons in the presence of collective flow was modeled by a momentum shift @xmath4 perpendicular to the jet direction in the gyulassy - wang s static potential@xcite , but this assumption lacks sufficient theoretical evidence .",
    "afterwards , local transport coefficient @xmath5 , which is related to the squared average transverse momentum transfer from the medium to the hard parton per unit length , has been investigated in the presence of transverse flow@xcite . by applying a lorentz boost of @xmath5 , a macroscopic result for parton energy loss based on bdmps",
    "calculation@xcite was investigated with assuming the hard parton travels with light velocity . however , this method is adaptable only for light quark energy loss . heavy quark energy loss can not be studied in this way since its velocity is less than c. so a method to study both light and heavy quark energy loss in the presence of collective flow is needed .",
    "pqcd , a theory describing the strong interactions between quarks and gluons , can be a good selection here .",
    "moreover , the most interesting feature of the result of jet quenching is the quadratical distance dependence of the total energy loss because of the non - abelian nature of qcd radiation and the landau - pomercanchuk - migdal ( lpm ) interference .",
    "both the non - abelian feature and lpm effect were studied in pqcd@xcite . so that it is an interesting issue to study jet quenching in the presence of collective flow in pqcd .",
    "in addition , only radiative energy loss can be studied in ref.@xcite , the detailed balance effect with gluon absorption , which need to be studied in pqcd , can not be included .",
    "it has been shown that the gluon absorption plays an important role for the intermediate jet energy region@xcite .    in this letter , we report a first study of the parton energy loss with detailed balance in the presence of collective flow in pqcd .",
    "we first determine the model potential to describe the interaction between the energetic jet and the scattering target partons of the moving quark - gluon medium using lorentz boosts . based on this new potential",
    ", we then consider both the radiation and absorption induced by the self - quenching and multiple scattering to the first order in opacity in the presence of flow .",
    "we obtains to the zeroth order opacity , the energy loss is dominated by the final - state thermal absorption .",
    "this thermal absorption is @xmath6 times as that in the static medium because of different gluon distribution in the moving medium . to the first order in opacity the collective flow changes the lpm destructive interference .",
    "it reduces the jet energy loss induced by rescattering with stimulated emission depending on the direction of the flow in the positive jet direction , but hardly changes thermal absorption by rescattering . in the framework of opacity expansion developed by gyulassy , lvai and vitev ( glv)@xcite and wiedemann@xcite",
    ", it was shown that the higher order corrections contribute little to the radiative energy loss in the static medium . here in the moving medium with collective flow .",
    "we will calculate the contribution from the second order in opacity to the energy loss .",
    "we are led to the conclusion that in the presence of flow , the second order in opacity correction also contributes little as in the static case .",
    "overall , the collective flow increases energy gain , but decreases emitted energy loss , so that the total effective energy loss is decreased .",
    "to calculate the induced radiation energy loss of jet in a static medium , the interaction potential is assumed in the gyulassy - wang s static model @xcite that the quark - gluon medium can be modeled by n well - separated color screened yukawa potentials , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the debye screening mass , @xmath9 is strong coupling constant , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the color matrices for the jet and target parton at @xmath12 respectively . in this potential , each scattering has no energy transfer ( @xmath13 ) but only a small momentum @xmath14 transfer with the medium .",
    "if using the four - vector potential , the gyulassy - wang s static potential can be denoted as @xmath15 .    as is well known in electrodynamics , the static charge produces a static coulomb electric field , while a moving charge produces both electric and magnetic field .",
    "in analogy a moving target parton in the quark - gluon medium will produce color - electric and color - magnetic fields simutaneously due to the collective flow .",
    "therefore , the static potential model should be reconsidered .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the different energy loss of the same jet in a static medium and the quark - gluon medium with collective flow .",
    "the moving medium with a velocity @xmath16 can be obtained through lorentz boost of the rest frame as illustrated in fig.[fig : pic1 ] .",
    "however , since we consider energy loss of the same jet , the jet momentum need not been lorentz transformed .",
    "so we first take a lorentz transformation for exchanged four - momentum @xmath17 , and then for four - vector potential @xmath18 , we can then write @xmath19 in the observer s system frame @xmath20 as @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "the new potential differs from gyulassy - wang s static potential in that the collective flow of the quark - gluon medium produces a color - magnetic field and the flow leading to non - zero energy transfer @xmath23 , which will affect jet energy loss as we will show below .",

    "our result agrees with the glv elastic cross section in static potential when the flow velocity goes to zero @xcite .",

    "although the radiation amplitude is the same as that in the static case , the energy gain changes to @xmath6 times as that in the static medium because the collective flow changes the thermal gluon distribution function .",
    "when a hard parton goes through the quark - gluon medium , it will suffer multiple scattering with the parton target inside the medium .",

    "so the scattering amplitude with one of the target partons , as compared to the static case , is changed to @xmath54 with considering flow , the four - vector potential @xmath55 replaces the static potential @xmath56 @xcite in the static case .",
    "one then obtains that the factorized amplitude @xmath57 is changed by the collective flow with a factor @xmath58 .",

    "<S> in the presence of collective flow a new model potential describing the interaction of the hard jet with scattering centers is derived based on the static color - screened yukawa potential . the flow effect on jet quenching with detailed balance </S>",
    "<S> is investigated in pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out , considering the collective flow with velocity @xmath0 along the jet direction , the collective flow decreases the lpm destructive interference comparing to that in the static medium . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon absorption plays a more important role in the moving medium . </S>",
    "<S> the collective flow increases the energy gain from gluon absorption , however , decreases the energy loss from gluon radiation , which is @xmath1 times as that in the static medium to the first order of opacity . in the presence of collective flow , </S>",
    "<S> the second order in opacity correction is relatively small compared to the first order . so that the total effective energy loss is decreased . </S>",
    "<S> the flow dependence of the energy loss will affect the suppression of high @xmath2 hadron spectrum and anisotropy parameter @xmath3 in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
