    "the application of single - charge tunneling effects in electrical metrology has been considered in a view of capacitance and current standards based on charge quantization phenomena ( see , e.g. , review @xcite ) .",
    "the proper charge quantization in circuits with small tunnel junctions has been achieved for low junction transparencies : @xmath2{k\\omega}$ ] for the single - electron tunnelling resistance , and @xmath3 for cooper pair devices , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the josephson coupling and charging energies , respectively .",
    "for example , remarkable advances have been made in development towards the single - electron standard of capacitance @xcite .",
    "the accurate operation of these circuits , based on pumping of single electrons , has been , however , limited to small currents , @xmath6 to @xmath7{pa}$ ] , because of the stochastic nature of single electron tunneling with a relatively long time constant .",
    "here we address the cooper pair transport in the case of substantial josephson coupling @xmath8 , i.e. , when both the josephson phase and the charge exhibit significant quantum uncertainties .",
    "in such rather transparent , and therefore large - current - capable junctions , high accuracy could still be achieved due to the exact @xmath9-periodicity of their energy bands as a function of the quasicharge @xcite .",
    "the related transport phenomenon is known as bloch oscillations in a current - biased junction with a fundamental current - frequency relation @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "successful attempts to phase - lock the bloch oscillation by an external signal were made in the early 1990s ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in the single junctions biased through high - ohmic on - chip microresistors for frequencies up to @xmath11{ghz}$ ] .",
    "unfortunately , the linewidth of oscillations was found to be rather large , @xmath12{ghz}$ ] , which was supposedly due to significant thermal fluctuations which smeared the current plateaus .",
    "moreover , a possible size of these plateaus was expected to be rather small , scaling as a small threshold voltage in a single junction .",
    "our approach is based on 1d arrays of small josephson junctions . as was shown theoretically for current - biased arrays @xcite and proved experimentally for very long voltage - biased al arrays ( @xmath13 ) @xcite ,",
    "these arrays are analogous to long josephson junctions : similar to the fluxons formed in the long junctions , the charge profile in the array is governed by the sine - gordon type of equation , describing the cooper pair solitons of size ( in number of junctions ) @xmath14 @xcite . here",
    "we denote as @xmath15 the effective junction capacitance , related to the curvature of the ground state energy @xmath16 and , hence , the shape of this 2@xmath17-soliton ; @xmath18 is the self - capacitance of the intermediate islands .",
    "the coherent motion of a train of 2@xmath17-solitons along an array biased via high - ohmic resistors can be described by a set of non - stationary equations :    @xmath19    which includes the quasicharge - dependent bloch inductances of the junctions @xmath20 which were recently introduced in @xcite , with corresponding initial and boundary conditions . here",
    "we denote the set of junction quasicharges as @xmath21 . in the limit of small josephson coupling , @xmath22",
    ", the periodic term @xmath23 takes the form of the sawtooth function with the amplitude @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the capacitance of the individual junctions in the array . in the opposite case ,",
    "@xmath26 , there is an analytic expression @xcite :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 $ ] is a numerical factor describing exponential suppression of the bloch band width for @xmath29 .    in this paper , we report the dc properties of autonomous arrays of @xmath30 squids ( see the sem photo in fig .  [ sem ] ) , fabricated using the al / oxide / al - cr shadow evaporation process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in a 4-point layout with cr microstrips of @xmath31{\\mu m}$]-length with @xmath32{k\\omega}$ ] each .",
    "the tunnel resistance was @xmath33{k\\omega}$ ] and an estimated capacitance was @xmath34{ff}$ ] per junction , which corresponds to the maximum josephson coupling energy of each squid , @xmath35{\\mu ev}$ ] and the charging energy @xmath36{\\mu ev}$ ] per link , yielding their ratio @xmath37 .",
    "we roughly estimate @xmath38{af}$ ] .",
    "the samples were measured in the current - bias mode with an external high - ohmic bias resistor , @xmath39{m\\omega}$ ] .",
    "the capacitance of each connection line to ground was @xmath40{nf}$ ] , resulting in an @xmath41-constant of the bias circuitry of @xmath42{s}$ ] .",
    "our microwave - tight holder was supplied with thermocoax@xmath43 filters ( jacket @xmath44{mm}$ ] , 110  cm long ) , anchored to the mixing chamber .",
    "several important peculiarities can be observed in the @xmath0-characteristics of the arrays shown in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] . in our opinion",
    ", the most remarkable transport property of the system relates to the bias current range @xmath45 to @xmath46{pa}$ ] , with zero to negative slope of the @xmath0-curve ( see the blow - up of the corresponding region in the right inset in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] ) , which we assume to be an indication of the bloch oscillation regime @xcite . due to the moderate current values",
    ", the ramping of quasicharge in this transport regime occurs sufficiently slowly that the system always stays in the zero bloch band and experiences 2@xmath17-periodic oscillations of the voltage with the frequencies up to @xmath47{ghz}$ ] . at larger currents",
    ", the average voltage across the array gradually increases , presumably due to excitation of the upper energy bands @xcite , thus setting a high - frequency limit for possible application of these particular josephson arrays as sources of a quantized current .",
    "note that , despite a large number of junctions in our arrays , this limitation , being at the level of ghz , is virtually of the same scale with the frequencies of phase - locking experiments on single junctions @xcite , whereas the typical voltage scale is much larger , which is promising for a better observability of the bloch oscillations .",
    "on the other hand , small depth of the back - bending , typically , few percent , points out the low duty cycle of bloch oscillations with the short pulse duration of @xmath48{ghz})^{-1 } \\ll f^{-1}$ ] , where we use a rough estimate for the `` input '' capacitance of the array , @xmath49{ff}$ ] ( see below for our estimation of the effective value @xmath15 ) .",
    "we attribute the present form of oscillations to insufficiently high impedance of the biasing resistors .",
    "simple estimations show that the observed upper frequency limit for a single - band behaviour of about @xmath50{ghz}$ ] is achieved by the system biased only slightly above its coulomb blockade threshold , therefore resulting in a typical decay time profile of oscillations .",
    "a broad spectrum of such oscillations , with considerable contribution of higher harmonics , makes it difficult to ensure their effective phase - locking to an external high - frequency signal .",
    "in particular , the preliminary experiments on microwave irradiation of our resistor - biased arrays up to frequencies of about @xmath50{ghz}$ ] did not result in observable features in the @xmath0-curves . on the other hand ,",
    "it was shown in @xcite for the josephson oscillations that even such oscillations may be effectively phase - locked using a driving signal of an appropriate waveform .    as an indication of a hysteretical behaviour due to the inductance term in the equation of motion ( [ sinegordon ] ) @xcite , the biasing point at small currents @xmath51{pa}$ ]",
    "was found to be unstable , exhibiting relatively slow irregular voltage oscillations , see left inset in fig .",
    "[ ivc ] . as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ hystere ] , random switching of the array from the blockade to the finite - current state was followed by a relatively slow recharging of the line capacitance @xmath52 , which made possible the real - time observation of the switching cycles . in the blockade state ,",
    "a@xmath53b , with a life - time @xmath54 , the current source charged the input terminal of the array until its switching , b@xmath53c , to the finite - current state , @xmath55{na}$ ] , followed by a rapid discharging , c@xmath53d , down to voltages @xmath56{\\mu v}$ ] and retrapping , d@xmath53a , facilitated by the presence of fluctuations ( cf . the thermally enhanced retrapping process in a shunted josephson junction @xcite ) .",
    "whilst at @xmath57{mk}$ ] the average escape time , @xmath58 , was nearly temperature - independent ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ times ] , the switchings at @xmath59{mk}$ ] were due to thermal escape over the barrier whose height we have evaluated to be @xmath60{\\mu ev}$ ] , as estimated from the slope of the ahrrenius plot , see inset to fig .",
    "[ times ] .    using the approach",
    "@xcite which is valid , strictly speaking , only in the weak - coupling case @xmath61 , we obtained a rough estimate of the effective junction capacitance and the length of a soliton in the array .",
    "it is possible to express the barrier height @xmath62 through the threshold voltage @xmath63 of soliton motion :    @xmath64    taking advantage of the narrow range of switching voltages at @xmath65{mk}$ ] , @xmath66 , we estimated @xmath67{\\mu v}$ ] , a soliton energy @xmath68{\\mu ev } > e_{\\rm c}$ ] , the effective bloch capacitance @xmath69{ff } \\gg c_{\\rm t}$ ] , and the size of a soliton @xmath70 .",
    "one can see that the effective bloch capacitance greatly exceeds the geometric junction capacitance which is obviously due to the strong suppression of the bloch band width , @xmath71 , for the values of @xmath72 [ see , e.g. , the limiting case , @xmath26 , described by equation ( [ largelambda ] ) ] .",
    "the shape of a static 2@xmath17-soliton in the infinitely long array is shown in fig .",
    "[ soliton ] as calculated by numerically solving the equation ( [ sinegordon ] ) in the stationary case @xmath73 , for several representative values of the ratio @xmath74 .",
    "our dc measurements pointed out the presence of autonomous bloch oscillations in a resistively biased array of small josephson junctions .",
    "compared to the experiments with single bloch junctions reported by other groups , similar bloch frequencies are expected , whereas the coulomb voltage threshold and , as a consequence , the amplitudes of oscillations are considerably larger , making a potential advantage of using the arrays for phase - locking experiments .",
    "however , to enable an external synchronization of these oscillations one should realize at least several times higher bias impedance , possibly in form of very resistive microstrips . a certain increase in the bloch frequency",
    "could be expected for the junctions with a larger josephson energy .",
    "but since the voltage scale is also affected by the values of @xmath75 and @xmath5 , a detailed optimization is still important . using the statistics of the spontaneous state switchings",
    ", we evaluated the effective junction capacitance and the length of a cooper pair soliton .",
    "these data can be helpful for future device development . for practical applications , the influence of the background charges in the islands of the array on the soliton dynamics should also be investigated .",
