    "for instance , the mixing times , hitting times and exit probabilities of quantum walks can differ significantly from analogously defined random walks @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "two types of quantum walks exist in the literature : the discrete - time quantum coined walks and continuous - time quantum walks @xcite .",
    "although both the two types of quantum walks have efficient quantum algorithms with respect to their classical counterparts , quantum walks show some advantages in dealing with decoherence processes compared to the discrete - time quantum algorithms , which are very sensitive to environmental quantum noise @xcite .    here , we focus on continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) .",

    "although ctqws have received much attention and there has been some work about ctqws on general graphs , many questions about ctqws appear to be quite difficult to answer at the present time . for simple structures these quantum walks are analytical solvable and directly related to the well - known problems in solid state physics .",
    "recently , oliver mlken et al have studied the spacetime structures of ctqws on one - dimensional and two - dimensional lattices with periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the topology of the lattices they considered is oversimplified , i.e. , each node is only connected to its two nearest neighbors . for regular graphs with symmetrical structure ,",
    "the dynamics of the quantum transport is determined by the topology of the network . to this end , it is natural to consider quantum transport on general lattices with more connectivity .    in this paper , we study ctqws on one - dimension ring lattice of @xmath0 nodes in which every node is connected to its @xmath1 nearest neighbors ( @xmath2 on either side ) .",

    "<S> in this paper , we consider continuous - time quantum walks ( ctqws ) on one - dimension ring lattice of @xmath0 nodes in which every node is connected to its @xmath1 nearest neighbors ( @xmath2 on either side ) . in the framework of bloch function ansatz , we calculate the spacetime transition probabilities between two nodes of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transport of ctqws between two different nodes is faster than that of the classical continuous - time random walk ( ctrws ) . the transport speed , which is defined by the ratio of the shortest path length and propagating time , increases with the connectivity parameter @xmath2 for both the ctqws and ctrws . for fixed parameter @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the transport of ctrws gets slow with the increase of the shortest distance while the transport ( speed ) of ctqws turns out to be a constant value . in the long time </S>",
    "<S> limit , depending on the network size @xmath0 and connectivity parameter @xmath2 , the limiting probability distributions of ctqws show various patterns . when the network size @xmath0 is an even number , the probability of being at the original node differs from that of being at the opposite node , which also depends on the precise value of parameter @xmath2 . </S>"
