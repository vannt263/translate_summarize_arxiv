    "recent studies of the properties and host galaxies of @xmath3-ray bursts ( grbs ) reveal some indirect evidence for the link between grbs and star formation",
    ". optical measurements of the offset distribution of grbs from their host centers appears to be consistent with the distribution of collapsars in an exponential disk , but inconsistent with the expected offset distribution of delayed binary mergers ( @xcite ) .",
    "grb990705 is an illustrative example of this result since hst images revealed that the burst was situated in a spiral arm , just north of an apparent star forming region ( holland et al .",
    "2000 ; @xcite ) . the absence of optical afterglows from the so - called `` dark grbs '' ( djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ) points to the association of grbs with heavily obscured , and possibly star - forming , regions .",
    "in addition , galama & wijers ( 2000 ) claim high column densities toward several grbs from x - ray observations of afterglows    consequently , one of the pressing questions in the study of grb host galaxies is whether they are representative of star - forming galaxies at a similar redshift .",
    "if they are , then the dust - penetrating power of grbs and their broadband afterglow emission offer a number of unique diagnostics of their host galaxies : the obscured star formation fraction , the ism within the disk , the local environment of the burst itself , and global and line - of - sight extinction , to name a few .",
    ", which has one of the brightest ( apparent magnitude ) hosts to date ( @xmath16 mag ; @xcite ; @xcite ) offers an excellent opportunity for detailed studies .",
    "the afterglow optical and near - ir ( nir ) lightcurves exhibited pronounced flattening about 6 days after the burst and this was attributed to an underlying bright host ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) undertook spectroscopic observations of the host and obtained a redshift of 0.966 . using three different estimators ( [ oii ] , h@xmath17 and 2800 uv continuum ) of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) , djorgovski et al . ( 1998 ) inferred extinction - corrected sfr of 10 to 30 m@xmath5/yr .    here",
    "we report radio observations of covering the period 3501000 days after the burst at three frequencies : 1.43 , 4.86 , and 8.46 ghz .",
    "this burst has the distinction of being followed up for 1000 days ; the previous record - holder was grb 970508 ( 445 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "we summarize the radio observations and data reduction in  [ sec : obs ] . in ",
    "[ sec : ag ] we show that the late time radio observations require a steady component over and above the decaying afterglow observations .",
    "we argue that this component is unlikely to arise from an agn but is instead due to star - formation . in  [",
    "sec : sfr ] , we infer the sfr from the radio observations and compare and contrast this estimate to those derived from optical observations . thanks to the high angular resolution and accurate astrometry of radio observations we are able to derive an accurate offset between the burst and the centroid of the host , as well as constrain the size of the radio emitting region (  [ sec : offset ] ) .",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations of were initiated on 1998 , july 4.40 ut at 4.86 ghz .",
    "all observations were obtained in the standard continuum mode with @xmath18 mhz contiguous bands .",
    "we used the extra - galactic sources j2330 + 110 , j0010 + 109 and j0022 + 061 for phase calibration and 3c48 ( j0137 + 331 ) and 3c147 ( j0542 + 498 ) for flux calibration .",
    "we used the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) for data reduction .",
    "the fluxes presented here are the values measured on the images at the position of the source .",
    "late - time observations ( time after the burst , @xmath19 days ) were co - added over a period of a few to thirty days in order to increase the overall sensitivity of each detection .",
    "this is appropriate since the expected change in the flux density from the afterglow over a few days , several hundred days after the burst , is negligible relative to the associated errors in the measurements .",
    "a log of the late - time observations and the flux density measurements are summarized in table  [ tab : vla ] , and the lightcurves are shown in figure  [ fig : radiolc ] . a summary of the early radio data , as well as broadband modeling is given in berger et al .",
    "from figure  [ fig : radiolc ] , we see that the late - time ( @xmath19 days ) radio lightcurves do not exhibit the customary power - law decay expected of afterglows but instead show flattening . from the early broadband data we know that the afterglow spectrum peaked at frequency , @xmath20 hz at @xmath21 days ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the explosion was spherical then we expect @xmath22 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus the radio afterglow is expected to decay for @xmath23 days after the burst .",
    "if the ejecta were collimated ( opening angle , @xmath24 ) , then we expect a more rapid decay , @xmath25 , once the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath26 , of the flow falls below @xmath24 , @xmath27 ( @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", we expect the radio afterglow to start decaying at even earlier times , and the flux will decay faster relative to a spherical explosion . in either case , we expect the radio afterglow to decay by at least a factor of three over the time span under consideration , @xmath28 days .",
    "we can clearly see from figure  [ fig : radiolc ] that this decay is not taking place , and the flux instead remains constant over a period of approximately 650 days .",
    "this behavior is similar to the flattening observed in the optical / nir lightcurves of several grbs ( including ) , when the emission from the afterglow decays below the level of emission from the host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the afterglow spectrum is expected to be a power law , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the power law index of the lorentz factor distribution of the shocked electrons , @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( @xcite ) . from the observations of many afterglows , we note that @xmath31 is in the range 2.22.6 and thus we expect @xmath34 .",
    "however , the observed spectral index in the range 1.438.46 ghz is much lower , @xmath35 .",
    "we thus conclude that there exists a steady source of emission other than the afterglow .",
    "one possible explanation for this component is emission from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "it has been noted in surveys of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) , its flanking fields , and the small selected area 13 ( ssa13 ) that approximately 20% of the radio sources are agn with spectral indices of about 0.3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found a similar result in their survey of two @xmath36 fields at 8.44 ghz .",
    "thus , there is a modest probability that the emission from the host of is due to an agn .",
    "we consider the agn hypothesis unlikely based on the radio data and optical spectroscopy .",
    "first , optical spectra of the source obtained by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) show no evidence for an unobscured agn : high - ionization lines such as mg ii @xmath37 , [ nev]@xmath38 , and [ nev]@xmath39 are absent , and the [ oiii]@xmath40 to h@xmath41 ratio is approximately 0.4 , much lower than @xmath42/h}\\beta>1.3 $ ] for agn ( @xcite ) . another way to discriminate between agn and star - forming galaxies is to correlate the [ oii ] equivalent width ( ew ) with continuum color ( @xcite ) .",
    "kennicutt ( 1992 ) showed that agn have redder colors for similar [ oii ] ew , relative to normal galaxies . using the spectrum presented in djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we evaluate the color index , @xmath43 $ ] ( @xcite ) , and find it to be @xmath44 ; an agn with the same [ oii ] ew would have a value @xmath45 ( @xcite ) . finally , rola , terlevich & terlevich ( 1997 ) found that for a sample of emission - line galaxies at @xmath46 , the color index between the continuum underlying the h@xmath41 and [ oii]@xmath47 lines is @xmath48 for all agn in their sample . using the spectrum of djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) we find that this color index is approxmiately zero .",
    "a second , but less persuasive argument against an agn origin is the apparent absence of significant radio variability over the 650 day monitoring period ( see figure  [ fig : fluc ] ) .",
    "the radio cores of most , but not all , low - luminosity agn show variability exceeding the observed levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the radio emission seen from the host of is unlikely to be due to agn activity . however , star - forming galaxies exhibit radio emission arising from their supernova remnants ( snrs ) and hii regions . in the next section",
    "we show how the observations , the radio spectral index , and the optical spectrum , are consistent with the hypothesis that the radio emission is related to star formation .",
    "star formation is traced by optical , far - ir , sub - mm , and radio emission . in the following",
    "we will use the radio data to estimate the sfr in the host galaxy of , and then compare the results with the sfr derived from optical indicators , and with radio surveys at a similar redshift range in order to place the host of in a larger context .      using all the measurements in table  [ tab : vla ] , we find the following weighted - average flux densities for the host galaxy of : @xmath49 @xmath0jy , @xmath50 @xmath0jy , and @xmath51 @xmath0jy . from the redshift of ,",
    "@xmath52 ( @xcite ) , and the cosmological parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 km / sec / mpc , we find that the luminosity distance to the burst is @xmath56 cm , and the observed luminosity at each frequency is given by @xmath57 .",
    "the emitted luminosity is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath41 is the spectral index of the radio emission , @xmath59 is the rest frequency , and @xmath60 is the observing frequency . from the flux densities we find that the radio spectral index is @xmath35 , and thus the emitted luminosity in each frequency is approximately 25% higher than the observed luminosity at the same frequency .",
    "condon ( 1992 ) showed that the total luminosity is a combination of synchrotron and thermal emission components , both directly related to the formation rate of massive stars via a simple relationship . moreover , since the lifetime of massive stars is of the order of @xmath61 years , and the lifetime of the synchrotron emitting electrons is of the order of @xmath62 years ( @xcite ) , the radio emission is an excellent probe of the instantaneous sfr . using the emitted luminosity at @xmath63 ghz , @xmath64 erg sec@xmath65 , we find that the sfr of massive stars in the host of is @xmath66    since both the thermal and non - thermal components are proportional only to the formation rate of high - mass stars , equation  [ eqn : massivesfr ] has to be modified by a factor which accounts for the contribution from stars in the mass range 0.15 m@xmath5 . for a salpeter imf",
    "this factor evaluates to 5.5 .",
    "we use the salpeter imf since it is already implicitly used in equation  [ eqn : massivesfr ] for the mass range 5100 m@xmath5 .",
    "thus , within this framework the total sfr is @xmath9 m@xmath5/yr .",
    "we now compare the sfr and other characteristics of the host of with those of other galaxies at a similar redshift .",
    "a radio survey of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) and its flanking fields showed that the mean spectral index of the 8.46 ghz selected sample is @xmath67 ( @xcite ) . in a survey of two @xmath36 fields with the vla at 8.44 ghz windhorst et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found for sources with a flux density @xmath68 @xmath0jy ( hereafter , @xmath0jy sources ) a median spectral index , @xmath69 , and fomalont et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found @xmath70 for @xmath0jy sources selected at 4.9 ghz .",
    "thus , the host galaxy of appears to be a normal @xmath0jy source compared to sources selected at 4.9 or 8.5 ghz .",
    "in addition , it has been noted ( @xcite ) that the spectral index of radio sources selected at frequencies larger than 5 ghz flattens from a value of approximately 0.7 for the mjy ( @xmath71 mjy ) population to 0.3 for @xmath0jy sources .",
    "the reason for the flattening of the spectral index is a varying ratio of thermal bremsstrahlung to synchrotron emission .",
    "supernova remnant shock acceleration of electrons results in synchrotron emission , with a characteristic spectral index of @xmath72 ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , thermal bremsstrahlung emission from hii regions , excited by star formation , has a much flatter spectral index , @xmath73 .",
    "thus , as the direct contribution from massive stars increases the spectra are expected to flatten from a value of 0.8 to 0.1 .",
    "this is exactly the effect that is observed in the aforementioned surveys .    within the hdf and ssa13 richards",
    "( 1999 ) identified radio sources with fluxes in the range 10100 @xmath0jy with bright disk galaxies with @xmath74 mag .",
    "the @xmath75 color for these galaxies is approximately 2.5 mag .",
    "bloom et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find @xmath76 mag and @xmath77 mag for the host of .",
    "thus , we see from both the radio spectrum of the source , and the optical @xmath78 mag and @xmath75 color that the host galaxy of has the characteristics of a typical star - forming radio galaxy selected at 8.5 ghz .",
    "figure  [ fig : hdf ] shows the total sfr in the host galaxy of as compared to sources in the hdf , its flanking fields , ssa13 , and v15 ( @xcite ) in the redshift range @xmath79 .",
    "these fields have been observed to @xmath0jy sensitivities at cm wavelengths , and the detected radio sources have been identified with optical sources for which the redshift was determined .",
    "we use the flux and spectral index measurements along with equation  [ eqn : massivesfr ] and the correction factor to calculate the total sfr .",
    "it is clearly seen from the figure that the host of is an average galaxy at @xmath11 based on star formation .",
    "this conclusion meshes well with the comparison of the radio spectral index , optical @xmath78 mag , and optical @xmath75 color of the host of to the same sample .",
    "djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) used h@xmath17 and the 2800 uv continuum to calculate a sfr of approximately 10 m@xmath5/yr in the host of , after correcting for rest - frame extinction , @xmath80 mag .",
    "sokolov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found a similar intrinsic extinction , @xmath81 , and based on template spectral energy distributions found that the best model for the broadband optical spectrum is given by exponentially decreasing star formation with an extinction - corrected sfr of 20 m@xmath5/yr .",
    "clearly , the sfr derived from optical indicators is much lower than the value from radio measurements , even after correcting for extinction .",
    "this result is part of a general trend that has been observed in galaxies with @xmath82 m@xmath5/yr ( @xcite ) .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) propose dust reddening dependent on sfr as the solution to this problem , and we therefore expect a much better result if we use their prescription . extending their correlation to @xmath83 m@xmath5/yr , we find that the predicted observed sfr from h@xmath17 is approximately 70 m@xmath5/yr .",
    "this value is still much higher than the measured sfr .",
    "in fact , in the hopkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample the optically - derived sfr rarely exceeds 10 m@xmath5/yr , while the radio - derived values go up to several hundred m@xmath5/yr , indicating that the optical emission does not trace the entire star - forming volume .",
    "thus , the sfr values for this particular galaxy are not unexpected .    the sub - mm ( e.g. 350 ghz ) emission from galaxies serves as another estimator of sfr , and it is related to the radio emission at 1.43 ghz via a redshift - dependent spectral index , @xmath84 ( @xcite , 2000 ; @xcite ) . using the calibration of dunne , clements & eales ( 2000 ) we find a value of @xmath85 at @xmath11 , which gives @xmath86 mjy .",
    "observations with the sub - millimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) camera on the james clark maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) 12.4 days after the burst provided a @xmath87 upper limit of 3.2 mjy on the combined emission from the afterglow and host at 350 ghz ( @xcite ) , consistent with the predictions from the radio  sub - mm relation .",
    "to conclude , we use the derived sfr to calculate the expected far - ir ( fir ) emission from the host of .",
    "the luminosity of the fir radiation can be derived from the empirical relation suggested by helou , soifer & rowan - robinson ( 1985 ) , @xmath88 which evaluates to @xmath89 l@xmath5 for the host of ; here @xmath90 is the total flux in the range 40120 @xmath0 m in units of erg sec@xmath65 @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the flux density at 1.4 ghz in units of erg sec@xmath65 @xmath91 hz@xmath65 .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2001 ) provide the calibration @xmath93 l@xmath5 , which gives @xmath94 l@xmath5 , in good agreement with the previous value .",
    "these values of the fir luminosity place the host galaxy of in the category of ulirg ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : offset ] shows the projected angular offset between the host galaxy and afterglow of , for each individual detection , and the combined value from all observing runs ( insert in figure  [ fig : offset ] ) .",
    "positions are determined from gaussian fits , and the host - grb offset is calculated with respect to a very long baseline array ( vlba ) position that was measured to 0.0007 arcsec accuracy in each coordinate on 1998 august 2 at 8.42 ghz ( berger et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we find an average offset from all measurements of @xmath95 arcsec in ra and @xmath96 arcsec in declination .",
    "the uncertainty in the position of the source is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the half - power synthesized beam - width , @xmath99 is the observing wavelength , @xmath100 is the length of the maximum baseline , and @xmath101 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the flux measurement .    the optical measurements of bloom , kulkarni & djorgovski ( 2000 ) for the host of , give an angular offset of @xmath102 in ra and @xmath103 in declination ( see insert in figure  [ fig : offset ] ) .",
    "they conclude that was not significantly offset from the center of its host galaxy , in agreement with the more accurate offset measurements in the radio .",
    "in addition to accurate measurements of the offset , the radio observations allow us to place meaningful limits on the size of the radio - emitting region ( i.e. the size of the star - forming region ) .",
    "we find that in our highest resolution images the source is unresolved , and therefore , based on the synthesized beam size we can derive an upper limit on the physical size of the source .",
    "for our adopted cosmological parameters ( section  [ sec : sfr ] ) we find that the angular diameter distance to the source is @xmath104 cm . the full synthesized beam - width at 8.46 ghz is @xmath105 arcsec , which gives an upper limit of @xmath106 kpc on the diameter of the source .",
    "holland et al . ( 2001 ) used a @xmath107 profile to fit the optical emission from the host and found that the best fit gives a half - light radius of 0.13 arcsec , which corresponds to an exponential disk with a scale - diameter of 0.44 arcsec .",
    "thus , the physical size of the galaxy is @xmath108 kpc , 60% larger than the upper limit from our radio measurements .",
    "however , holland et al . ( 2001 ) claim that the center of the galaxy is 0.2 mag bluer than the outer regions of the host .",
    "if so , star formation must be mainly taking place within the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "since the radio emission directly traces current star formation , we expect the radio emission to be more centrally concentrated than the optical emission .",
    "thus , as expected , the radio size of the galaxy is smaller than the optical size .",
    "most likely the grb is located within the nuclear starburst given the small offset of the grb from the centroid of the galaxy . if so it raises the question of why the afterglow was not completely extinguished by dust .",
    "in fact , in order to reconcile the optical and radio derived sfrs we require a rest - frame extinction of @xmath109 mag .",
    "observations of the afterglow , which provide an estimate of extinction along the line - of - sight to the burst , give values of 12 mags from optical observations , and somewhat higher values from x - ray observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the extinction in the nuclear star - forming region is higher than the average over the whole galaxy , and the correction to the observed optical sfr is almost sufficient to reconcile it with the value of 500 m@xmath5/yr derived from the radio .",
    "the relatively small source size also agrees well with the classification of the host of as a ulirg exhibiting a starburst .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 , and references therein ) showed that star formation with a rate @xmath110 m@xmath5/yr invariably takes place in circumnuclear regions of size 0.22 kpc , in the form of nuclear starburst . as a result",
    ", we expect that ulirgs will have such size scales when traced by star formation , and the source size we measured for the host of indicates that it is probably undergoing a nuclear starburst .",
    "finally , from the source size and offset measurement we conclude that took place in the region of maximum star formation , providing further indirect evidence linking grbs to massive stars",
    "late - time observations of reveal a steady component , with a flux density @xmath51 @xmath0jy and a spectral index @xmath35 .",
    "the spectral and temporal characteristics of this emission indicate that it does not arise from the afterglow itself , but rather it is the result of star formation in the host galaxy , with @xmath111 m@xmath5/yr .",
    "this leads to the interpretation that this host galaxy is a ulirg undergoing a starburst .",
    "in addition , the star formation is concentrated within the inner two kpc of the host , and the progenitor of was positioned within this region of star formation .",
    "this conclusion lends additional support for the collapsar model .",
    "if grbs really come from massive stars , then they can be used to trace the star formation history of the universe ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , grbs and their afterglows are potentially detectable out to very high redshifts ( @xcite ) .",
    "these propositions , taken together with the dust - penetrating power of their @xmath3-ray emission , make grbs a unique tool for the study of galaxies and the igm over a wide redshift range .",
    "in particular , radio and sub - mm / fir observations of a grb - selected galaxy sample will be extremely useful for the study of the obscured star formation fraction , and the properties of starbursts at high redshifts .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the global star formation history as derived from these long - wavelength host studies , with the redshift distribution of grbs , will provide valuable insight as to how well grbs trace the formation rate of massive stars ; we expect that if grbs trace only a particular channel of star formation , the two distributions will not agree .    therefore , it is imperative to study the hosts of grbs in the radio and sub - mm / fir .",
    "future observatories such as the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ; to be launched in july 2002 ) , the expanded vla ( evla ) , and the square - kilometer array ( ska ) will allow detailed studies of these hosts . in the fir , sirtf will have the ability to detect sources down to a few mjy , allowing the detection of galaxies with sfr comparable to that in the host of out to @xmath112 ; alternatively , we will be able to detect hosts with sfr as low as a few m@xmath5/yr at @xmath113 .",
    "the evla and ska will greatly improve the detectability of host galaxies in the radio , and will also allow much higher angular resolution studies of compact star - forming regions . with a factor ten increase in resolution and a factor five increase in sensitivity over the current vla",
    ", we will be able to probe scales of approximately 5 mas with the evla ; for a galaxy at @xmath114 this translates to a physical scale of 150 pc .",
    "in addition , evla will detect galaxies with a total sfr as low as 50 m@xmath5/yr at @xmath113 .",
    "the ska , with a similar resolution , but a much larger collecting area , will extend this capability to even lower sfr and smaller star - forming regions .",
    "thus , as more host galaxies are detected and studied in detail in the radio and sub - mm / fir , we will be able to address a large number of issues pertaining not only to the bursts themselves , but also to the characteristics of galaxies at high redshifts .",
