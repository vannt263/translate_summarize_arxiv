    "it has recently been recognized that a more appropriate division on [ c / fe ] for the identification of cemp stars is at somewhat lower carbonicity , e.g. , [ c / fe ] @xmath130.7 @xcite . in the past few decades , it has become clear that such stars comprise a significant fraction of all vmp stars ( @xmath14 10 - 20% ; @xcite ) , one that increases strongly with declining metallicity , from 30% for [ fe / h ] @xmath153.0 , to 40% for [ fe / h ] @xmath153.5 , @xmath1675% for [ fe / h ] @xmath154.0 and 100@xmath17 for [ fe / h]@xmath185.0 .",
    "this trend has been confirmed with the many thousands of cemp stars identified by @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and segue-2 ( c. rockosi et al . , in preparation )",
    ".    for most cemp stars there exists a clear correlation between carbon enhancement and the over - abundance of elements produced by @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis , such as ba ( cemp-@xmath5 stars ; see * ? ? ?",
    "this behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that these enhancements ( both for carbon and elements produced by the @xmath5-process ) are due to nucleosynthesis processes that took place during the asymptotic giant - branch ( agb ) stage of stellar evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting abundance pattern can arise from the star itself ( which should rarely be found , but see * ? ? ? * ) or by a now - extinct binary companion that transferred material to the surviving ( observed ) companion @xcite .",
    "multi - epoch radial - velocity measurements by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite demonstrated that the frequency of detected binaries among equivalent population  i ba stars and population  ii ch stars indicated that essentially all are members of binary systems . @xcite conducted a similar study for members of the more metal - deficient cemp-@xmath5 sub - class of stars , and reached the same conclusion .",
    "an intriguing variation on this behavior was initially recognized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the cemp stars cs  22948 - 027 and cs  29497 - 034 were found not only to be rich in the elements commonly produced by @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis , such as sr , y , ba , and la , but also in eu , an element that , for extremely low - metallicity stars , is more likely produced by @xmath19-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "additional studies by many groups have now identified @xmath1450 of these so - called cemp - r / s stars .",
    "these cases , once thought to be the rare exceptions , are as commonly represented among cemp stars as the `` @xmath5-only '' variety .",
    "the origin of the abundance patterns of the cemp-@xmath20 stars is not yet clear , and many scenarios have been proposed @xcite .",
    "for example , an association with a @xmath21ne neutron source in intermediate - mass agb stars has been suggested for progenitors of cemp-@xmath20 stars , rather than the @xmath22c neutron source thought to be active for low - mass agb stars , the likely progenitors of the cemp - s stars ( @xcite , hollek et al .",
    "2014 , submitted ) .",
    "mass transfer from a companion that passed through the agb phase of stellar evolution has been suggested previously as an explanation for the cemp-@xmath5 and cemp-@xmath20 classes of stars , based on the high fraction of such stars found in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the story has become richer still .",
    "@xcite , and others since , have shown that the correlation between carbon enhancement and the over - abundances of @xmath5- or @xmath20-elements no longer persists ( or at least is different in nature ) for the majority of cemp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath182.7 .",
    "these so - called cemp - no stars ( indicating no enhancement of neutron - capture elements ) suggest that a variety of carbon - producing mechanisms , other than that associated with agb stars , may have played a role in the early universe .",
    "possible progenitors for this sub - class include massive , rapidly rotating , mega metal - poor ( mmp ; [ fe / h ] @xmath186.0 ) stars , sometimes referred to as `` spinstars '' @xcite , which models suggest have greatly enhanced abundances of cno due to distinctive internal burning and mixing episodes , followed by strong mass loss @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is pollution of the ism by so - called faint supernovae associated with the first generations of stars , which experience extensive mixing and fallback during their explosions @xcite .",

    "the other is to obtain as complete an inventory as possible of the light and heavy neutron - capture elements for representative examples of the known varieties of cemp stars .",
    "although we have partial information from previous ground - based high - resolution spectroscopic observations , there remain many key elements , such as the light species ge and zr , and heavier species such as os and pt , that can only be obtained through near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the low abundance of li in this star , compared to the spite plateau value , could be a result of convective mixing with internal layers in which li is fully depleted .",

    "alternatively , the very low upper limits of be and b are consistent with the view that cemp - no stars such as  may have formed in the very early universe , _ prior _ to the establishment of the level of cosmic - ray flux necessary to produce be and b by spallation ( for a more detailed discussion , see the review by @xcite ) . the low abundance of li",
    "could then be accounted for by mixing of li - astrated material ( due to burning by first - generation stars ) with primordial li created by big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this alternative receives some support from the recent observations of li abundances below the spite plateau for cemp - no stars by @xcite , including two stars with @xmath31  = 6100  k , presumably too warm for conventional li - depletion from convective mixing to have taken place .",
    "it is worth recalling that @xcite reports that the cemp - no class _ only _ contains li - depleted stars .",
    "unfortunately , be and b abundance estimates are not yet available for the cemp - no stars of @xcite .",
    "improved models and , in particular , additional observations of be and b for cemp - no stars , are necessary in order to constrain these ideas further .",
    "it should be noted that , as already discussed by @xcite , the progenitor of is unlikely to be a significant source of high - energy cno nuclei that could yield lighter elements by spallation processes",

    "we have discussed above that our measurement of [ c / fe ] , based on the nuv atomic lines at 2478.56 and 2967.21 , provides an important validation of [ c / fe ] estimates for cemp stars based on the ch @xmath45-band in the optical , as well as from lines in the nir .",
    "since this is the first determination of [ c / fe ] from nuv spectroscopy , it would clearly be important to carry out similar observations of additonal bright cemp stars , in order to test if this level of agreement holds for stars that are cooler , or more metal - rich , than .    the [ ni / fe ] abundance ratio for can also place further constraints on galactic chemical - evolution models .",

    "<S> we present an elemental - abundance analysis , in the near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) spectral range , for the extremely metal - poor star , a 9th magnitude subgiant with [ fe / h ] @xmath0 and enhanced carbon , based on data acquired with the space telescope imaging spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope_. this star is the brightest example of a class of objects that , unlike the great majority of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars , does not exhibit over - abundances of heavy neutron - capture elements ( cemp - no ) . in this paper , we validate the abundance determinations for a number of species that were previously studied in the optical region , and obtain strong upper limits for beryllium and boron , as well as for neutron - capture elements from zirconium to platinum , many of which are not accessible from ground - based spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the boron upper limit we obtain for , @xmath1 , the first such measurement for a cemp star , is the lowest yet found for very and extremely metal - poor stars . in addition , we obtain even lower upper limits on the abundances of beryllium , @xmath2 , and lead , @xmath3 ( [ pb / fe]@xmath4 ) , than those reported by previous analyses in the optical range . taken together with the previously measured low abundance of lithium , </S>",
    "<S> the very low upper limits on be and b suggest that  was formed at a very early time , and that it could well be a bona - fide second - generation star . </S>",
