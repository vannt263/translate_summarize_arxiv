    "the super - kamiokande ( sk ) water - cherenkov experiment @xcite has recently confirmed @xcite , with high statistical significance , the anomalous flavor composition of the observed atmospheric neutrino flux , as compared with theoretical expectations @xcite . the flavor anomaly had been previously found in kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite , and later in soudan2 @xcite , but not in the low - statistics experiments nusex @xcite and frjus @xcite .",
    "the recent sk data have also confirmed earlier kamiokande indications @xcite for a dependence of the flavor anomaly on the lepton zenith angle @xcite , which is correlated with the neutrino pathlength .",
    "the features of this dependence are consistent with the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations , which represents the most natural ( and perhaps exclusive ) explanation of the data @xcite .",
    "the oscillation hypothesis is also consistent with other recent atmospheric neutrino data , namely , the finalized sample of kamiokande upward - going muons @xcite , the latest muon and electron data from soudan2 @xcite , and the samples of stopping and through - going muons in macro @xcite .    the sk atmospheric @xmath7 measurements , which are described in detail in several papers @xcite , conference proceedings @xcite , and theses @xcite , demand the greatest attention , not only for their intrinsic importance , but also for their interplay with other oscillation searches , including solar @xmath7 experiments @xcite and long baseline oscillation experiments at reactors",
    "@xcite and accelerators @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we contribute to these topics by performing a comprehensive , quantitative , and accurate study of the sk atmospheric @xmath7 data in the hypothesis of three - flavor mixing among active neutrinos .",
    "we also include , within the same framework , the recent data from the chooz reactor experiment @xcite .    more precisely , we consider the five sk angular distributions associated to sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events @xcite and to upward through - going muons @xcite , for a total of 30 accurately computed observables ( 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 10 zenith bins ) .",
    "first we study how such observables vary with the oscillation parameters , and then we fit them to the experimental data as measured in sk for an exposure of 33 kty ( 535 days ) @xcite .    in the two - flavor mixing case",
    ", we confirm the results of the sk collaboration analysis , namely , that @xmath2 oscillations are preferred over @xmath3 , and that the no oscillation case is excluded with high confidence . in the three - flavor mixing case",
    ", we perform our analysis with and without the additional constraints imposed by the chooz reactor experiment . in both cases ,",
    "the analysis favors a dominance of the @xmath2 channel . without the chooz constraints , the amplitudes of the subdominant @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions",
    "can also be relatively large , indicating that , at present , current sk data do not exclude sizable @xmath5 mixing by themselves .",
    "after combining the chooz and sk data , the amplitudes of the subdominant transitions become smaller , but we show that they can still play a nonnegligible role both in atmospheric , solar , and long baseline laboratory experiments .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the 30 sk observables used in the analysis , as well as the chooz measurement . in section",
    "iii we set the notation for our three - flavor oscillation framework .",
    "the two - flavor subcases are studied in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we perform the three - flavor analysis of sk data ( with and without the chooz constraints ) and discuss the results , especially those concerning @xmath5 mixing . in sec .",
    "vi we study the implications of our analysis for the neutrino oscillation phenomenology .",
    "we conclude our work in sec .",
    "vii , and devote appendixes  a and b to the discussion of technical details related to our calculations and to the statistical analysis .",
    "some of our previous results on two- and three - flavor oscillations of solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , laboratory @xcite neutrino experiments and their combinations @xcite will be often referred to in this work . in particular , the @xmath8 analyses in @xcite summarize the pre - sk situation .",
    "however , we have tried to keep this paper as self - contained as possible .",
    "in this section we discuss expectations and data for five sk zenith distributions : sub - gev @xmath1-like and @xmath0-like , multi - gev @xmath1-like and @xmath0-like , and upward - going muons , with emphasis on some critical aspects of both theory and data that are often neglected .",
    "finally , we discuss the chooz reactor results .",
    "a basic ingredient of any theoretical calculation or montecarlo simulation of atmospheric @xmath7 event rates is the flux @xmath9 of atmospheric neutrinos and antineutrinos s and @xmath10 s .",
    "of course , we properly distinguish @xmath7 from @xmath10 in the input fluxes and in the calculations of cross sections and oscillation probabilities . ] as a function of the energy @xmath11 and of the zenith angle @xmath12 .",
    "the flux @xmath13 is unobservable in itself , and what is measured is the distribution of leptons @xmath14 after @xmath7 interactions , as a function of the lepton energy @xmath15 @xmath16 and lepton zenith angle @xmath17 @xmath18 .    in fig .  1 we show the sum of theoretical @xmath7 and @xmath10 fluxes , as a function of the neutrino zenith angle @xmath12 , for selected values of the energy @xmath11 ( 1 , 10 , and 100 gev ) .",
    "the fluxes refer to the calculations of @xcite ( hkkm95 , solid lines ) and @xcite ( agls96 , dots ) without geomagnetic corrections ( so that the sign of @xmath19 is irrelevant in this figure ) .",
    "the upper and middle panels refer to muon and electron neutrinos , respectively , while the lower panel shows their ratio .",
    "several interesting things can be learned from this figure .",
    "for instance , the often quoted value @xmath20 for the muon - to - electron neutrino ratio clearly holds only for low - energy , horizontal neutrinos .",
    "this ratio increases rapidly as the neutrino energy increases and as its direction approaches the vertical .",
    "in fact , both @xmath21 and @xmath5 fluxes decrease towards the vertical ( see upper and middle panels ) , where the slanted depth in the atmosphere is reduced ; however , @xmath5 s are more effectively suppressed than @xmath21 s , due to their different parent decay chains . in addition , the greater the energy of the parents , the longer the decay lengths , the stronger the dependence of the @xmath22 flux ratio on the slanted depth and thus on the zenith angle @xmath12 . in other words , high - energy , vertical `` atmospheric @xmath7 beams '' are richer in @xmath21 s and , therefore , are best suited in searches for @xmath23 oscillations , where initial @xmath5 s represent the `` background '' ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we anticipate that , in fact , multi - gev data are more effective than lower - energy ( sub - gev ) data in placing bounds on @xmath23 transitions .",
    "another consequence of the non - flat @xmath22 ratio is the appearance of distortions of the zenith distributions that , although related to _ vacuum _ neutrino oscillation , _ do not _ depend on neutrino pathlength - to - energy ratio @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "finally , notice in fig .",
    "1 that the good agreement at low energies between the two reported calculations of @xmath22 is somewhat spoiled at high energies .",
    "this shows that the often - quoted uncertainty of @xmath25 for the @xmath22 ratio , which has been estimated in detail for _ low energy , integrated fluxes _",
    "@xcite , does not necessarily apply to high - energy or differential fluxes .",
    "therefore , also the @xmath26 lepton event ratio might suffer of uncertainties larger than @xmath25 in some energy - angle bins .",
    "our empirical estimate of such errors in the statistical analysis is detailed in appendix b. more precise estimates of the relative @xmath21 and @xmath5 flux uncertainties are in progress @xcite . a new",
    ", ab initio , fully three - dimensional calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite is also expected to shed light on these issues .",
    "concerning the overall uncertainty of the theoretical neutrino flux normalization , it is usually estimated to be 2030% .",
    "most of the uncertainty is associated to the primary flux of cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere .",
    "it is important , however , to allow also for energy - angle variations of such normalization ( e.g. , the sk analysis @xcite allows the spectral index to vary within @xmath27 ) . our approach to",
    "this problem is detailed in appendix b. here we want to emphasize that valuable information about the overall flux normalization can be obtained from more precise cosmic ray data from balloon experiments such as bess @xcite , caprice @xcite , and mass2 @xcite .",
    "the bess experiment has recently reported a relatively low flux of cosmic primaries @xcite , which , as we will see , might represent a serious problem for the oscillation interpretation of the sk data ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the mass2 experiment can also measure the flux of primary protons and secondary muons _ at the same time _",
    "@xcite , and might thus provide soon an important calibration of the theoretical flux calculations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect , in a few years , a reduction and a better understanding of the overall neutrino flux uncertainty , with obvious benefits for the interpretation of the atmospheric @xmath7 anomaly .    in order to obtain measurable quantities ( e.g. , the lepton zenith angle distributions )",
    ", one has to make a convolution of the neutrino fluxes with the differential cross sections and detection efficiencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we consider five zenith angle distributions of leptons : sub - gev muons and electrons , multi - gev muons and electrons , and upward through - going muons . concerning the calculation of the first four distributions ,",
    "we have used the same technique used in @xcite for the old kamiokande multi - gev distributions .",
    "this approach makes use of the energy distributions of parent _ interacting _ neutrinos @xcite .",
    "concerning upward through - going muons , we improve the approach used in @xcite by including the zenith dependence of the sk muon energy threshold as given in @xcite ; we also use the same sk choice for the parton structure functions ( grv94 @xcite , available in @xcite ) and muon energy losses in the rock @xcite . for all distributions ( sg ,",
    "mg , and up@xmath0 ) , we obtain a good agreement with the corresponding distributions simulated by the sk collaboration , as reported in appendix  a ( to which we refer the reader for further details ) .    in short",
    ", we can compute five distributions of sk lepton events as a function of the zenith angle @xmath17 , namely , sub - gev @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events ( 5 + 5 bins ) , multi - gev @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events ( 5 + 5 bins ) , and upward through - going muons ( 10 bins ) , for a total of 30 observables .",
    "few other analyses report explicit calculations of sub - gev and multi - gev zenith distributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or upward - going muon distributions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in agreement with the sk simulations .",
    "other authors perform detailed calculations but use a reduced zenith information , as that embedded , e.g. , in the up - down lepton rate asymmetry @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental data used in our analysis are reported in table  i and table  ii , together with the corresponding expectations as taken from the sk montecarlo simulations .",
    "the numerical values have been graphically reduced from the plots in @xcite and thus may be subject to slight inaccuracies .",
    "i reports the zenith angle distributions of sub - gev and multi - gev events collected in the sk fiducial mass ( 22.5 kton ) during 535 live days , for a total exposure of 33 kty .",
    "fully and partially contained multi - gev muons have been summed .",
    "only single - ring events are considered .",
    "the distributions are binned in five intervals of equal width in @xmath28 , from @xmath29 ( upward going leptons ) to @xmath30 ( downward going leptons ) .",
    "the total number of events in the full solid angle is also given .",
    "the quoted uncertainties for the data points are statistical .",
    "the statistical uncertainties associated to the sk montecarlo expectations originate from the finite simulated exposure ( 10 years live time @xcite ) .",
    "table  ii reports the differential and total flux of upward through - going muons as a function of the zenith angle .",
    "data errors are statistical only . in this case",
    ", there is no statistical error for the sk theoretical estimates , which are derived from a direct calculation @xcite and not from a montecarlo simulation .",
    "it is useful to display the information in tables  i and ii in graphical form . to this purpose , we take the central values of the theoretical expectations in tables  i and ii as `` units of measure '' in each bin . in other words ,",
    "all @xmath0 and @xmath1 event rates ( either observed , or calculated in the presence of oscillations ) are normalized to their standard ( i.e. , unoscillated ) expectations @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "anomaly which are hidden in the @xmath26 ratio and emerge only when @xmath0 and @xmath33 rates are separated . ]",
    "the following notations distinguish the various lepton samples : @xmath34    .super - kamiokande sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath1-like and @xmath0-like atmospheric neutrino data , compared with the corresponding montecarlo simulations in different zenith angle ( @xmath17 ) bins @xcite .",
    "the numerical values are graphically reduced from the plots in @xcite .",
    "units : number of events .",
    "experimental exposure : 33 kty , corresponding to 22.5 kton fiducial mass @xmath35 535 live days .",
    "simulated exposure : 10 yr @xcite .",
    "errors are statistical only .",
    "the super - kamiokande montecarlo simulations refer to hkkm95 neutrino fluxes @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure  2 compares theory and data for the total lepton rates .",
    "the mg@xmath0 data sample is further divided into fully contained ( fc ) and partially contained ( pc ) events ( notice that mg@xmath1 events are all fc ) .",
    "the total number of lepton events are displayed in the plane @xmath36 , so that the standard expectations ( mc ) correspond to the point @xmath37 for each data sample .",
    "the up and pc muons have no electron counterpart and are shown in the single variable @xmath38 ( upper strips ) .",
    "we attach a @xmath39 common uncertainty to the mc muon and electron rates ( large slanted error bar ) , and allow for a @xmath25 uncertainty in the @xmath26 ratio ( small slanted error bar ) .",
    "the three subfigures 2(a ) , 2(b ) , and 2(c ) correspond to three choices for the theoretical predictions ( mc ) : ( a ) standard mc expectations ; ( b ) mc rates multiplied by 1.2 ; and ( c ) mc rates multiplied by 0.8 .",
    "figure  2(a ) clearly shows that , with respect to the standard mc , sk observes a deficit of muons ( stronger for low - energy sg@xmath0 data and weaker for high - energy up@xmath0 data ) and , at the same time , an excess of electrons ( both in the sg and mg samples ) . in the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations",
    ", these indications would favor @xmath40 transitions , with a mass square difference low enough to give some energy dependence to the muon deficit .",
    "as far as _ total _ sk rates are concerned , this is a perfectly viable scenario .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows how the previous picture changes when one allows for an overall increase of the mc expectations ( say , @xmath41 ) .",
    "the relative excess of electrons disappears , while the muon deficit is enhanced .",
    "this situation is consistent with @xmath42 transitions , which leave the electron rate unaltered .",
    "the current sk data link rather strongly @xmath42 oscillations to an overall increase of the mc expectations : indeed , a good fit to the sg and mg data samples requires a mc `` renormalization '' by a factor @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "although this factor is acceptable at present , it might not be so in the future , should the mc predictions become more constrained . in particular ,",
    "if the recent bess indications @xcite for a relatively low flux of cosmic primaries were confirmed , then one should rather _ decrease _ the mc expectations @xcite .",
    "figure  2(c ) shows the effect of a mc decrease by 20% . in this case",
    "one would observe no deficit of muons ( and even an excess of up@xmath0 events ) and a @xmath44 excess of electrons , which can not be obtained in any known oscillation scenario .",
    "the discussion of fig .",
    "2 shows that : ( i ) theory ( no oscillation ) and data disagree , even allowing for a mc renormalization ; ( ii ) the oscillation interpretation depends sensitively on the size of the renormalization factor ; ( iii ) if this factor turns out to be @xmath45 , the oscillation hypothesis is jeopardized ; and ( iv ) it is thus of the utmost importance to calibrate and constrain the theoretical neutrino flux calculations @xcite through cosmic ray balloon experiments such as bess @xcite , and especially through simultaneous measurements of primary and secondary charged particles as in the forthcoming caprice and mass2 analyses @xcite .",
    "all this information would be lost if the popular `` @xmath26 double ratio '' were used .",
    "another piece of information that would be hidden by the double ratio is the fact that , in fig .  2 ,",
    "the sg and mg data points appear to be very close to each other in the @xmath36 plane , while it was not so in kamiokande @xcite .",
    "we are , however , unable to trace the source of such a difference ( which is independent of the mc normalization ) between sk and kamiokande .    since the total lepton rate information is subject to the above ambiguities , one hopes to learn more from _ differential rates _ and , in particular , from the zenith distributions of electrons and muons .",
    "these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "3 where , again , the rates @xmath46 have been normalized in each bin to the central values of their expectations @xmath47 ( from tables  i and ii ) .",
    "therefore , the no oscillation case corresponds to `` theory  =  1 '' in this figure , with an overall normalization error that we set at @xmath48 .",
    "deviations of the data samples ( dots with error bars ) from the standard ( flat ) distribution are then immediately recognizable . the electron samples ( sg@xmath1 and mg@xmath1 ) do not show any significant deviation from a flat shape , with the possible exception of a slight excess of upward - going ( @xmath49 ) sg electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "all the muon samples show a significant slope in the zenith distributions , especially for multi - gev data .",
    ", on average ) and therefore the flux of leptons is more diffuse in the solid angle . ]",
    "most of this work is devoted to understand how well two- and three - flavor oscillations of active neutrinos can explain these features of the sk angular distributions .",
    "we mention that additional sk measurements can potentially corroborate the neutrino oscillation hypothesis , namely , the stopping - to - passing ratio of upward - going muons @xcite , neutral - current enriched event samples @xcite , and azimuth ( east - west ) distributions of atmospheric @xmath7 events @xcite .",
    "such preliminary data will be considered in a future work .",
    "finally , the sk data themselves could be used for a self - calibration of the overall neutrino flux normalization . in particular , one should isolate a sample of high - energy , down - going leptons with directions close to the vertical , so that the corresponding parent neutrinos would be characterized by a pathlength , say , @xmath50 km and by an energy @xmath5120 gev . then , for a neutrino mass difference @xmath52 smaller than @xmath53 ev@xmath54 @xcite , the oscillating phase @xmath55 would also be small , and the selected sample could be effectively considered as unoscillated , thus providing a model - independent constraint on the absolute lepton rate and on the neutrino flux .",
    "the present sk statistics for strictly down - going , high - energy leptons , is not yet adequate to such a calibration .",
    "we will come back to this issue in the following .",
    "the chooz experiment @xcite searches for possible @xmath56 disappearance by means of a detector placed at @xmath57 km from two nuclear reactors with a total thermal power of 8.5 gw . with an average value of @xmath58 km / gev ,",
    "it is able to explore the @xmath59 oscillation channel down to @xmath60 ev@xmath54 in the neutrino mass square difference , improving by about an order of magnitude previous reactor limits @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity to neutrino mixing is at the level of a few percent , being mainly limited by systematic uncertainties in the absolute reactor neutrino flux .",
    "the ratio of observed to expected neutrino events is @xmath61 , thus placing strong bounds on the electron flavor disappearance @xcite .",
    "the chooz limits have been recently retouched ( weakened ) @xcite as a result of the unified approach to confidence level limits proposed in @xcite .    the impact of chooz for atmospheric oscillation searches and for their interplay with solar neutrino oscillations @xcite has been widely recognized ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "earlier studies of the interplay between reactor , atmospheric , and solar neutrino experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "given their importance , we have performed our own reanalysis of the chooz data in order to make a proper sk+chooz combination .",
    "we use the @xmath62 cross section as in our previous works @xcite , and convolute it with the reactor neutrino energy spectrum @xcite in order to obtain the positron rate . the expected rate",
    "is then compared with the data @xcite through a @xmath63 analysis .",
    "we have checked that , in the case of two - family oscillations , we obtain with good accuracy the exclusion limits shown in @xcite .",
    "our chooz reanalysis will be explicitly presented in section  iv .",
    "the chooz bound counts as one additional constraint ( the observed positron rate ) ; therefore , the global sk+chooz analysis represents a fit to 30 + 1 observables .",
    "in this section we set the convention and notation used in the oscillation analysis .",
    "we consider three - flavor mixing among active neutrinos : @xmath64 with @xmath65    it is sometimes useful to parametrize the mixing matrix @xmath66 in terms of three mixing angles , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and we have neglected a possible cp violating phase that , in any case , would be unobservable in our framework .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath73 are also indicated as @xmath74 in the literature .",
    "while three - flavor oscillation probabilities are trivial to be computed in vacuum ( i.e. , in the `` atmospheric part '' of the neutrino trajectory ) , refined calculations are needed to account also for matter effects in the earth . as in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we solve numerically the neutrino evolution equations for any neutrino trajectory , taking into account the corresponding electron density profile in the earth .",
    "our computer programs are designed to compute the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation probabilities for _ any possible _ choice of values for the neutrino masses @xmath75 and mixing angles @xmath73 .",
    "a complete exploration of the three - flavor neutrino parameter space would be exceedingly complicated .",
    "therefore , data - driven approximations are often used to simplify the analysis @xcite . as in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we use the following hypothesis about neutrino square mass differences : @xmath76 i.e. , we assume that one of the square mass differences ( @xmath77 ) is much smaller than the other @xmath78 , which is the one probed by atmospheric neutrino experiments ( and accelerator or reactor experiments as well @xcite ) .",
    "the small square mass difference is then presumably associated to solar neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "notice that the above approximation involves squared mass differences and not the absolute masses ( which can not be probed in oscillation searches ) .",
    "in particular , eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) simply states that there is a `` lone neutrino '' @xmath79 , and a `` neutrino doublet '' @xmath80 , the doublet mass splitting being much smaller than the mass gap with the lone neutrino .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ appr ] ) can be fulfilled with either @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "these two cases are not entirely equivalent when matter effects are taken into account , as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , the difference is hardly recognizable in the current atmospheric @xmath7 phenomenology @xcite . for simplicity , in this paper we refer only to the case @xmath81 , i.e. , to a `` lone '' neutrino @xmath79 being the heaviest one .    as far as @xmath83 ev@xmath54 and @xmath84 ev@xmath54 , atmospheric neutrino oscillations depend effectively only on @xmath85 .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath77 the approximation ( [ appr ] ) begins to fail , and subleading , @xmath77-driven oscillations can affect the atmospheric @xmath7 phenomenology .",
    "we will briefly comment on subleading effects in sec .",
    "vi  c. earlier discussions of such effects in solar and atmospheric neutrinos can be found in @xcite .      under the approximation ( [ appr ] )",
    "one can show that cp violating effects are unobservable , and that the angle @xmath67 can be rotated away in the analysis of atmospheric neutrinos ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in other words , atmospheric @xmath7 experiments do not probe the mixing @xmath86 associated with the quasi - degenerate doublet @xmath80 , but only the flavor composition of the lone state @xmath79 , @xmath87 the neutrino oscillation probabilities in vacuum assume then the simple form : @xmath88 where @xmath89\\cdot l\\,[{\\rm km } ] } { e_\\nu\\ , [ { \\rm gev}]}\\right)\\ , \\label{s}\\ ] ] neutrino and antineutrino probabilities being equal .",
    "however , in matter @xmath90 , and the probabilities must be calculated numerically for the earth density profile . for a constant density , they can still be calculated analytically @xcite .",
    "one can make contact with the familiar two - flavor oscillation scenarios in three limiting cases : @xmath91 with the corresponding , further identifications ( valid only in the @xmath92 cases ) : @xmath93    finally , we remind that for pure @xmath2 oscillations the physics is symmetric under the replacement @xmath94 , due to the absence of matter effects .",
    "such effects instead break the ( vacuum ) symmetry @xmath95 for pure @xmath3 oscillations , for which the cases @xmath96 and @xmath97 are distinguishable . and consider the cases @xmath98 or @xmath99 @xcite . ] in generic three - flavor cases , no specific symmetry exists in the presence of matter and the mixing angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 must be taken in their full range @xmath100 $ ] . a full account of the symmetry properties of the oscillation probability in @xmath92 and @xmath8 cases , both in vacuum and in matter , can be found in appendix  c of @xcite .",
    "as previously said , under the hypothesis ( [ appr ] ) the parameter space of atmospheric @xmath7 s is spanned by @xmath101 . at any fixed value of @xmath85 ,",
    "the unitarity condition @xmath102 can be embedded in a triangle graph @xcite , whose corners represent the flavor eigenstates , while a generic point inside the triangle represents the `` lone '' mass eigenstate @xmath79 . by identifying the heights projected from @xmath79 with the square matrix elements @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 ,",
    "the unitarity condition ( [ unit ] ) is automatically satisfied for a unit height triangle @xcite .",
    "4 shows the triangle graph as charted by the coordinates @xmath106 ( upper panel ) or @xmath107 ( lower panel ) .",
    "when @xmath79 ( the mass eigenstate ) coincides with one of the corners ( the flavor eigenstates ) , the no oscillation case is recovered .",
    "the sides correspond to pure @xmath92 oscillations .",
    "inner points in the triangle represent genuine @xmath8 oscillations .",
    "in this section we study first how the theoretical zenith distributions are distorted , in the presence of two flavor oscillations , with respect to the `` flat '' expectations of fig .",
    "3 . this introductory study does not involve numerical fits to the data , and helps to understand which features of either @xmath2 or @xmath3 oscillations may be responsible for the observed sk zenith distributions .",
    "we then fit the most recent sk data ( 33 kty ) using a @xmath63 statistics , and discuss the results .",
    "figure @xmath108 shows , in the same format as in fig .  3 , our calculations of the five zenith distributions of atmospheric neutrino events .",
    "in this and in the following figures , the upper left box contains comments on the scenario , while the upper right box displays the selected values of @xmath109 . in fig .",
    "5 we consider , in particular , pure @xmath2 oscillations @xmath110 with maximal mixing ( @xmath111 ) . of course",
    ", the electron distributions are not affected by @xmath2 transitions , while the muon event rates are suppressed , especially for zenith angles approaching the vertical ( @xmath29 , upward leptons ) , corresponding to longer average neutrino pathlengths .",

    "ev@xmath54 the expected rates of sg@xmath0 and up@xmath0 are significantly suppressed , and for @xmath114 ev@xmath54 one approaches the limit of energy - averaged @xmath92 oscillations , with a flat suppression of @xmath115 , which does not appear in agreement with the data . on the other hand ,",
    "decreasing @xmath85 down to @xmath116 ev@xmath54 ( thick , solid line ) , one has almost `` unoscillated '' distributions for the high energy samples mg@xmath0 and up@xmath0 , since the phase @xmath117 is small . at lower energies ( i.e. , sg@xmath0 events )",
    ", however , this phase can still be large enough to distort the zenith distribution .",
    "notice that in fig .  5 the theoretical electron distributions sg@xmath1 and mg@xmath1 are always below the data points . using the overall @xmath48 normalization freedom",
    ", one can imagine to `` rescale up '' all the five theoretical distributions ( by , say , 1520% ) to match the electron data .",
    "this upward shift would also alter the muon distributions at the same time , but one can easily realize that such distributions would still be in reasonable agreement with the data for @xmath112 and @xmath53 ev@xmath54 . therefore , at @xmath118 one expects an allowed range of @xmath85 around @xmath112@xmath53 ev@xmath54 , independently of the details of the statistical analysis .",
    "values of @xmath85 outside this range do not agree with the muon data .    as a final comment to fig .  5",
    ", we notice that the theoretical rate for downgoing multi - gev muons ( rightmost bin of the mg@xmath0 sample ) is practically identical to the unoscillated case for @xmath119 ev@xmath54 , as also observed at the end of sec .",
    "ii  b. therefore , the sk data can potentially self - calibrate the _ absolute _ muon rate normalization _ independently of oscillations _ , provided that the total experimental error in the last mg@xmath0 bin is reduced to a few percent .    in fig .",
    "6 we take @xmath85 fixed ( at @xmath120 ev@xmath54 ) and vary the @xmath21-@xmath121 mixing ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the suppression of the muon rates increases with increasing mixing ; however , there is no dramatic difference between @xmath118 and 0.75 ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "a value as low as @xmath123 is not in agreement with the sg and mg muon distributions , although it is still allowed by the up@xmath0 sample ( which does not place strong bounds on the mixing ) .",
    "if all the distributions were renormalized ( scaled up ) to match the sg@xmath1 and mg@xmath1 samples , small mixing values would be even more disfavored . therefore , we expect the mixing angle to be in the range @xmath1241 , independently on the details of the statistical analysis .",
    "we emphasize that , although in principle @xmath1-like events are not affected by @xmath2 oscillations , the sg@xmath1 and mg@xmath1 samples affect indirectly the estimate of the mass - mixing parameters , since they drive the fit to higher values of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "further experimental constraints on the overall neutrino flux normalization might have then a significant impact on the current estimates of @xmath85 and @xmath125 .",
    "7 is analogous to fig .  5 , but for @xmath3 oscillations with maximal mixing ( @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) .",
    "matter effects are included .",
    "the expected sg and mg rates of electrons coming from below appear to be enhanced , due to @xmath21 s oscillating into @xmath5 s .",
    "the slope of the zenith distribution is stronger for mg@xmath1 than for sg@xmath1 , because : ( i ) the @xmath22 flux ratio increases with energy , as observed in section  ii  a ; and ( ii ) the `` angular smearing '' due to the different lepton and neutrino directions is more effective for sg events . on the other hand , the suppression of the muon rates is not as effective as for the @xmath2 case in fig .",
    "5 . in fact",
    ", now there are some @xmath5 s oscillating back into @xmath21 s .",
    "moreover , matter effects tend to _ suppress _ large - amplitude oscillations ( when the mixing is maximal in vacuum , it can only be smaller in matter ) . in general",
    ", one has a too strong increase of electrons and a too weak suppression of muons , although this pattern may be in part improved by _ rescaling down _ all the theoretical curves . in this case",
    ", the distributions at @xmath112 and @xmath53 ev@xmath54 can get in marginal agreement with all the data , while @xmath128 ev@xmath54 is in any case excluded .",
    "notice , however , that @xmath113 ev@xmath54 is not allowed by chooz @xcite .",
    "figure  8 shows the effect of varying the @xmath3 mixing , for @xmath129 ev@xmath54a value safely below the chooz bounds .",
    "it can be seen that variations of the mixing do not help much in reaching an agreement with the data for this value of @xmath85 , which thus seems to be disfavored .",
    "figure  9 shows the size of matter effects for @xmath129 ev@xmath54 and maximal @xmath3 mixing . for values of @xmath85 around @xmath130 ev@xmath54 such as this , matter effects are more important for the multi - gev sample , while lower @xmath85 values would enhance the effect for the sub - gev sample and higher values for the up@xmath0 sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite and figs .  4 and 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "it can be seen that , in any case , the net matter effect is a decrease of the slope of the zenith distribution for both muons and electrons , i.e. , a suppression of the oscillation amplitude with respect to the `` pure vacuum '' case .",
    "the effect is not completely reduced to zero above horizon , due to the neutrino - lepton angular smearing .",
    "we summarize the content of figs .",
    "79 by observing that the theoretical zenith distributions , in the presence of @xmath3 oscillations , are at most in marginal agreement with the sk data set .",

    "our allowed range of @xmath85 in fig .",
    "10(a ) is somewhat narrower than the range estimated by the sk collaboration @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the differences are largely due to the fact that only sg and mg were fitted in @xcite , while here we include also up@xmath0 data , which help to exclude the lowest values of @xmath85 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to a lesser extent , our different definition of @xmath63 ( see appendix  b ) also plays a role .    figures 10(b ) and 10(c ) refer to @xmath3 oscillations ( @xmath135 ) in the plane ( @xmath85,@xmath136 ) , for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively ( the two cases being different , see sec .",
    "iii  b ) .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath63 is now much higher ( 67.7 and 68.6 for panel ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively ) indicating that @xmath3 oscillations are disfavored by the sk data .",

    "they are excluded by the chooz reactor experiment .",
    "figure  10(d ) shows the chooz bounds , as derived by our own @xmath63 reanalysis , in good agreement with the limits shown in @xcite .",
    "such bounds are in contradiction with the @xmath3 allowed regions in fig .",
    "10(b , c ) at 90% c.l . , ( although there might be a marginal agreement at 99% c.l . ) ; therefore , we do not make any attempt to combine sk+chooz data in a @xmath92 analysis .    summarizing , our results for two - flavor oscillations are consistent with the @xmath92 analysis of the sk collaboration @xcite , namely : ( i ) the no oscillation hypothesis is rejected with high confidence ; and ( ii ) @xmath2 oscillations are largely preferred over @xmath3 . on our part , we add the following nontrivial statement : ( iii ) the present sk bounds on the @xmath2 mass - mixing parameters are in good agreement with those obtained from the global analysis of pre - sk data in @xcite ( including nusex , frjus , imb , and kamiokande sub - gev and multi - gev data ) .    finally , we comment upon recent claims @xcite of inconsistencies within the sk data , under the hypothesis of @xmath2 oscillations .",
    "the argument goes as follows .",
    "if @xmath2 oscillations are assumed , the electron excess has to be adjusted by rescaling up the theoretical predictions .",
    "then the overall muon deficit becomes close to maximal ( @xmath115 ) for the sg and mg data ( see our fig .  2 , middle panel ) .",
    "such large suppression of the muon rate seems to suggest energy - averaged oscillations ( i.e. , large @xmath85 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the zenith distortions _ require _ energy - dependent oscillations ( i.e. , relatively small @xmath85 ) . some difference between the `` total rate '' and the `` shape '' information ,",
    "although exacerbated by the semiquantitative calculations of @xcite , indeed exists but is not entirely new , as it has already been investigated by the sk collaboration @xcite .",
    "in fact , the slide no .",
    "18 of @xcite shows the separate @xmath2 fits to the `` total rate '' and `` shape '' data , the former preferring values of @xmath85 tipically higher than the latter .",
    "however , in the same slide @xcite one can see a reassuring , large overlap between the two allowed ranges ( at @xmath137 c.l . ) for @xmath138 ev@xmath54 .",
    "this means that , within the present ( relatively large ) experimental and theoretical uncertainties , there is no real contradiction between different pieces of sk data , as also confirmed by our good @xmath2 global fit to the sk data .",
    "however , the above remarks , as well as our comments on the absolute event rates in sec .",
    "ii , should be kept in mind when new , more accurate experimental or theoretical information will become available .",
    "in this section we discuss in detail a three - flavor analysis of the sk and chooz data . in the first subsection",
    "we show representative examples of @xmath8 oscillation effects on the zenith distributions . in the second subsection",
    "we discuss some issues related to the @xmath24 variable . in the third and fourth subsections we report the results of detailed fits to the sk data , without and with the additional constraints from the chooz experiment , respectively .",
    "we remind that , in three flavors , the chooz mixing parameter @xmath139 can be identified with @xmath140 [ eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) ] ; therefore , the chooz constraint @xmath141 , valid for @xmath142 ev@xmath54 @xcite , translates into either @xmath143 or @xmath144 .",
    "in a three - flavor language , two - flavor oscillations with maximal @xmath2 mixing are characterized by @xmath145 ( the center of the lower side in the triangle graph of fig .",
    "analogously , maximal @xmath3 mixing is characterized by @xmath146 ( the center of the right side of the triangle ) .",
    "a smooth @xmath8 interpolation between these @xmath92 cases can be performed by gradually increasing the value of @xmath103 from 0 to 1/2 , and decreasing the value of @xmath105 from 1/2 to 0 at the same time , the element @xmath104 being adjusted to preserve unitarity .",
    "this exercise is performed in fig .  11 for a relatively high value of @xmath85 ( @xmath147 ev@xmath54 ) .",
    "the thick and thin solid lines represent the zenith distributions for pure @xmath2 and pure @xmath3 oscillations with maximal mixing , respectively .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines represent intermediate @xmath8 cases , the first being `` close '' to @xmath2 ( with an additional @xmath148 admixture of @xmath5 ) , and the second being `` close '' to @xmath3 ( with an additional @xmath148 admixture of @xmath121 ) .",
    "although none of the four cases depicted in fig .  11 represents a good fit to all the sk data , and three of them are excluded by chooz , much can be learned from a qualitative understanding of the zenith distributions in this figure .    in the presence of oscillations , the distributions @xmath149 in fig .",
    "11 are roughly given by @xmath150 @xmath31 and @xmath32 being the unoscillated rates .",
    "for a relatively high value of @xmath85 as that in fig .  11 , the asymptotic regime of energy - averaged oscillations approximately applies , except for the rightmost bins of the mg and up@xmath0 distributions ( where the shorter pathlengths require higher @xmath85 s for reaching such regime ) .",
    "then , for pure @xmath2 oscillations with maximal mixing , one has @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , so that @xmath154 and @xmath155 , as indicated by the thick , solid lines in fig .  11 .    for pure @xmath3 oscillations with maximal mixing , one has @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath153 , so that @xmath158 and @xmath159 . for sub - gev data ,",
    "the often - quoted value @xmath160 applies , so that @xmath161 and @xmath162 , as indicated by the thin , solid lines in the sg@xmath1 and sg@xmath0 panels of fig .",
    "11 . for multi - gev data",
    ", however , the value @xmath163 is not constant , ranging from @xmath164 along the horizontal @xmath165 to @xmath166 along the vertical @xmath167 , see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath38 decreases slightly from @xmath168 ( horizontal ) to @xmath169 ( vertical ) , while the ratio @xmath170 increases significantly from @xmath171 ( horizontal ) to @xmath164 ( vertical ) .",
    "this is particularly evident as a `` convexity '' of the mg@xmath1 distribution in fig .",
    "11 ( thin , solid line ) .",
    "such behavior is not confined to pure two - flavor oscillations , but is also present in genuine three - flavor cases , as indicated by the dashed and dotted lines in the mg@xmath1 panel of fig .",
    "this shows that , in the presence of @xmath172 mixing ( @xmath173 ) , the variations of the unoscillated ratio @xmath163 with @xmath28 induce distortions of the zenith distributions even in the regime of energy - averaged oscillations @xcite , contrary to naive expectations .",
    "notice that such distortions do not depend on @xmath24 , but on @xmath174 and @xmath11 separately through @xmath175 .",
    "another peculiar distortion , not dependent on @xmath24 , is related to a genuine three - flavor effect in matter @xcite .",
    "this effect is basically due to the splitting of the quasi - degenerate doublet @xmath80 in matter which , in the limit of large @xmath85 , leads to an effective square mass difference @xmath176 and thus to a subleading oscillation phase @xmath177 which does not depend on @xmath11 but only on @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "the main effect , relevant for atmospheric neutrinos , is to _ decrease _ the @xmath21 survival probability @xmath178 by an amount @xmath179 which , for a constant electron density @xmath180 , reads @xcite @xmath181 notice that the oscillation amplitude can be sizable only for large three - flavor mixing , while it disappears for two - flavor mixing ( i.e. , when one of the @xmath106 is zero ) , as indicated by the comparison of the dotted and thin solid lines in the mg@xmath0 and up@xmath0 panels of fig .",
    "the phase of @xmath179 ( the argument of @xmath182 ) can be rather large in the earth matter ( @xmath1836 mol/@xmath184 ) and is modulated by the neutrino zenith angle @xmath12 .",
    "this modulation is particularly evident in the genuine @xmath8 cases of the up@xmath0 panel in fig .",
    "11 ( dotted and dashed lines ) , since upward through - going muons are highly correlated in direction with the parent neutrinos ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 modulation of @xmath179 is increasingly smeared out in the lower energy mg and sg muon samples .",
    "we remind that in fig .",
    "11 the dashed curves ( @xmath186 ) correspond to a @xmath8 `` perturbation '' of pure @xmath2 oscillations ( thick solid curves , @xmath187 ) , while the dotted curves ( @xmath188 ) correspond to a @xmath8 `` perturbation '' of pure @xmath3 oscillations ( thin solid curves , @xmath189 . by comparing the dashed and thick solid curves",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath8 perturbations of @xmath2 oscillations do not alter dramatically the zenith distributions .",
    "the opposite happens for the @xmath3 case ( dotted and thin solid curves ) .",
    "this pattern can be explained as an interference between vacuum and matter effects .",
    "more precisely , let us consider the case of large @xmath85 and @xmath190",
    ". a @xmath8 perturbation of @xmath2 oscillations with maximal mixing can be parametrized by taking @xmath191 and @xmath192 ( the @xmath92 case being recovered for @xmath193 ) .",
    "the relevant oscillation probabilities are then @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 [ notice that @xmath179 is of @xmath197 , see eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) ] .",
    "equations  ( [ app1],[app2 ] ) give the muon and electron rates , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "therefore , to the first order in @xmath200 , the electron rate does not vary , and the muon rate varies little since @xmath201 and @xmath179 partly cancel .",
    "conversely , a @xmath8 perturbation of @xmath3 oscillations with maximal mixing can be parametrized by taking @xmath202 and @xmath203 ( the @xmath92 case being recovered for @xmath193 ) .",
    "the relevant oscillation probabilities are then @xmath156 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 .",
    "the muon and electron rates are now given by @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "to the first order in @xmath208 , the electron rate decreases , and also the muon rate is suppressed , since the terms @xmath209 and @xmath179 have the same sign .",
    "therefore , adding some @xmath121 mixing ( @xmath210 ) to @xmath3 oscillations changes the predictions considerably ( generally in the direction of a better fit to the data ) .",
    "for this reason , we expect significant changes in the fit to sk data when moving continuously from pure @xmath3 oscillations to genuine @xmath8 cases .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have discussed the above three - flavor effects at large @xmath85 .",
    "values of @xmath85 lower than in fig .",
    "11 are more interesting phenomenologically ( being less constrained by chooz ) but more difficult to understand qualitatively , since the oscillations are no longer energy - averaged , and @xmath92 , @xmath8 , vacuum , and matter effects are entangled .",
    "numerical calculations are required , and the results for @xmath211 and @xmath212 ev@xmath54 are shown in figs .  12 and 13 , respectively ( with mixing values chosen as in fig .  11 ) .",
    "the value @xmath129 ev@xmath54 is safely below the chooz bounds . in figs .",
    "12 and 13 , the genuine @xmath8 cases ( dashed and dotted curves ) show an improved agreement with the data ( with respect to pure @xmath2 oscillations ) , since they give an excess of electrons without perturbing too much the muon distributions .",
    "although this advantage is not decisive at present , in view of the large uncertainties affecting the absolute normalization of the lepton rates , it might become crucial when such uncertainties will be reduced .",
    "if two - flavor @xmath2 oscillations @xmath213 were the true and exclusive explanation of the sk atmospheric data , then it would make sense to try to reconstruct the ( unobservable ) @xmath24 distribution of parent neutrinos from the lepton energies and directions .",
    "in fact , any distortion effect should be related to vacuum oscillations and thus to the ratio @xmath24 rather than to @xmath174 and @xmath11 separately .",
    "the theoretical and experimental @xmath24 distributions for sk can be found in @xcite .",
    "however , beyond the @xmath92 approximation , there are several oscillation effects that do not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "some of these effects , originating from @xmath5 mixing @xmath214 , have been described in the previous subsection .",
    "non-@xmath24 effects also arise in the presence of two comparable square mass differences ( i.e. , @xmath215 instead of @xmath216 ) , or if non - oscillatory phenomena contribute to partially explain the data .",
    "therefore , plots in the @xmath24 variable convey correct and unbiased information only under the hypothesis of pure @xmath2 oscillations . in all other cases ,",
    "including our @xmath8 framework , such plots can not be used consistently .",
    "the following @xmath8 fits , as for the @xmath92 cases , make use of the zenith distributions and not of the reduced @xmath24 information .",
    "figure  14 shows our three - flavor fit to the sk data in the triangle graph , for values of @xmath85 decreasing from @xmath217 to @xmath218 ev@xmath54 .",
    "the curves at 90% and 99% c.l .  correspond to an increase of @xmath63 by 6.25 and 11.36 above the global minimum .",
    "the results , shown separately for sub - gev , multi - gev , and upward - going muons in the first three columns of triangles , are then combined in the last column .",
    "the chooz data are excluded in this fit , in order to study what one can learn just from the sk data .    for @xmath219 ev@xmath54 ,",
    "the sub - gev data exclude all two - flavor oscillation subcases ( the triangle sides ) , but are consistent with genuine three - flavor oscillations at large @xmath103 ( @xmath220 ) .",
    "also multi - gev data are not in agreement with two - flavor oscillations , although the @xmath2 subcase ( lower side of the triangle ) can not be excluded at 99% c.l .",
    "multi - gev data are well fitted by genuine three - flavor oscillations , but in a range of @xmath103 different ( lower ) than for sub - gev data .",
    "the quality of the mg fits improves rapidly as one moves from the right side ( @xmath3 ) to the inner part of the triangle , as expected from the discussion of fig .  11 in sec .",
    "v  a. the good @xmath8 fit to sg and mg data is mainly driven by the genuinely @xmath8 matter effects discussed in sec .",
    "v  a [ see eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) and related comments ] .",
    "upward going muon data are much less constraining  at 99% c.l.they allow any oscillation scenario . at 90% c.l .",
    "they disfavor : ( i ) pure or quasi - pure @xmath4 and @xmath40 oscillations ( left and right sides ) ; and ( ii ) large three - flavor mixing ( the central region of the triangle ) .",
    "large @xmath8 mixing is excluded because it suppresses and distorts too much the up@xmath0 distribution ( see fig .",
    "the regions allowed separately by sg , mg , and up data have no common intersection , and the combination of all the data is a null region ( last triangle ) .",
    "for @xmath221 ev@xmath54 , the increasing energy - angle dependence of the oscillation probability helps to fit the data better .",
    "therefore , the regions allowed in the triangle are larger for each of the three data sets , and a small allowed region appears at 99% c.l .  in the combination .",
    "such region is enlarged for a lower value of @xmath85 ( @xmath222 ev@xmath54 ) and it appears also at 90% c.l .  at @xmath223 ev@xmath54 .",
    "for the latter value of @xmath85 , all the data are consistent with @xmath2 oscillations ( the lower side ) , while the other two - flavor subcases ( the left and right sides ) are excluded . the mg data sample `` repels '' @xmath3 oscillations more strongly than sg data since , as observed in sec .",
    "ii  a , higher - energy samples are characterized by a larger @xmath26 unoscillated ratio , and thus are more sensitive to the presence ( or absence ) of @xmath21-@xmath5 mixing .    for @xmath224",
    "ev@xmath54 , also the global combination of the data is consistent with @xmath2 oscillations , with large but not necessarily maximal mixing .",
    "large values of @xmath103 are also allowed , indicating that the sk data , by themselves , do not exclude large three - flavor mixing .",
    "we remark that the goodness of the fit improves rapidly when one moves from the right side inwards ( i.e , when one `` perturbs '' pure @xmath3 oscillations ) , while it changes more slowly when one moves from the lower side upwards ( i.e. , when one `` perturbs '' pure @xmath2 oscillations ) , as expected from the discussion in sec .",
    "v  a.    figure  15 is analogous to fig .",
    "14 , but for lower values of @xmath85 , ranging from @xmath225 to @xmath226 ev@xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath85 decreases , the sg data fit is not affected very much , since values as low as few@xmath227 ev@xmath54 still provide a good fit to this sample . however , the oscillation phase starts decreasing more rapidly for higher - energy samples ( mg and up ) , leading to an insufficient suppression of the muon rates and to a gradual reduction of the allowed regions .",
    "notice , in particular , how up@xmath0 data constrain @xmath8 mixing for @xmath2283 ev@xmath54 . in any case , the preferred regions are more and more reduced and closer to the lower side of the triangle , corresponding to smaller allowed values for @xmath103 . there is no joint allowed region at 99% c.l .   for @xmath85 below @xmath229 ev@xmath54 .",
    "we summarize the three - flavor fit to sk data as follows : ( i ) the sk data exclude both @xmath230 and @xmath231 , being consistent with large @xmath2 mixing ( not necessarily maximal ) ; ( ii ) values of @xmath103 as large as 0.5 can not be excluded only on the basis of sk data .",
    "indeed , @xmath8 oscillations with large @xmath5 mixing can improve the fit and , in particular , it can explain ( part of ) the electron excess in the sg and mg samples .",

    "the middle column reports the fit to chooz data , which exclude a large horizontal stripe .",
    "in fact , the nonobservation of @xmath5 disappearance implies that @xmath79 is either very close to the upper corner @xmath5 ( so as to suppress oscillations ) or very close to the lower side ( @xmath2 oscillations being unobservables in chooz ) .",
    "clearly , the addition of the chooz bounds to the sk fit ( right column of triangles ) cuts significantly the upper part of the solutions , so that only relatively low values of @xmath103 are allowed .",
    "however , the chooz bounds are rapidly weakened as @xmath85 is decreased , and for @xmath235 ev@xmath54 the parameter @xmath103 can be as large as @xmath236 at 90% c.l.and @xmath237 at 99% c.l . , corresponding to a significant @xmath5 appearance probability [ see eq .  ( [ p ] ) ] . therefore ,",
    "the chooz data constrain but _ do not _ exclude the role of @xmath5 mixing and electron appearance in the interpretation of the sk data ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , part of the electron excess in the sg and mg samples could be explained by nonzero values of @xmath103 rather than by uncertainties in the overall neutrino flux normalization .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath103 also contribute to distort the zenith distributions @xcite , as discussed in sec .",
    "v  a.    so far we have seen the impact of chooz on the mixing parameters @xmath238 .",
    "the impact on the square mass difference @xmath85 is summarized in fig .",
    "17 , which shows the @xmath63 as a function of @xmath85 , for unconstrained values of the mixing angles and for both fits to sk ( dashed lines ) and sk+chooz ( solid lines ) .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath63 is @xmath239 for sk and @xmath240 for sk+chooz , indicating a good fit to the data ( 30 and 31 observables , respectively ) .",
    "the chooz data help to constrain @xmath85 on the higher range , but its role decreases rapidly for @xmath241 ev@xmath54 .    also shown in fig .",
    "17 are the 90% and 99% c.l .",
    "intervals for @xmath85 , which allow values as low as @xmath242 ev@xmath54 .",
    "the possibility of exploring such low values of @xmath85 should be seriously considered in long baseline experiments .",
    "an interesting result of fig .",
    "17 is the stability of the @xmath85 range indicated by sk  it does not change dramatically by adding the chooz constraint .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the chooz data in the global analysis affects more the mixing than the mass parameter .",
    "a comparison of sk and pre - sk bounds is illuminating .",
    "figure 17 should be compared with fig .",
    "10 of @xcite , where we combined the data from nusex , frjus , imb , and kamiokande ( sub - gev and multi - gev ) in a three - flavor analysis .",
    "the comparison shows that the sk and sk+chooz bounds on @xmath85 are perfectly consistent with the pre - sk bounds .",
    "the sk+chooz data appear to improve significantly the old upper bound on @xmath85 , but give a lower bound very similar to the pre - sk data .",
    "notice that we have long since claimed that the popular value @xmath243 ev@xmath54 overestimated the best fit for pre - sk data , and that values as low as @xmath242 ev@xmath54 were compatible with the atmospheric @xmath7 data @xcite .",
    "we plan to perform a joint analysis of all the data ( sk+chooz+pre - sk ) in a future work .",
    "in this section we examine some implications of our three - flavor analysis for the phenomenology of atmospheric , long - baseline , and solar neutrino experiments , as well as for model building .",
    "the sk atmospheric data are consistent with @xmath8 oscillations with dominant @xmath2 transitions ( @xmath244 at 90% c.l . ) and subdominant @xmath245 mixing @xmath246 .",
    "the mass square difference @xmath85 is favored in the range @xmath247@xmath248 ev@xmath54 .",
    "can one improve significantly such indications only with sk or other atmospheric data ?",
    "large @xmath2 mixing should generate a @xmath121 flux comparable to the @xmath21 flux at the detector site .",
    "however , the `` contamination '' of @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events from @xmath249 production and subsequent leptonic decay is estimated to be very small in sk @xcite .",
    "therefore , there seems to be little hope to test the @xmath2 channel through @xmath249 appearance in sk .",
    "nevertheless , the possibility of enhancing ( through appropriate cuts ) the @xmath250 and @xmath251 `` pollution '' in selected @xmath0 and @xmath1 event samples may deserve further attention in other atmospheric @xmath7 detectors such as soudan2 .",
    "the tests of @xmath5 mixing ( i.e. , of the matrix element @xmath103 ) can certainly be improved with higher statistics sk data , in particular with more multi - gev upgoing electron and muon events .",
    "such data samples are characterized by a relatively high @xmath22 flux ratio ( see sec .",
    "ii  a ) , and thus are more sensitive to an increase of @xmath1-like events due to @xmath3 transitions .",
    "multi - gev data are already more powerful than sg ( and up@xmath0 ) data in constraining @xmath103 ( see fig .",
    "while the elements @xmath106 determine the _ amplitude _ of oscillations , which can be already derived from total event rates , the parameter @xmath85 governs the _ phase _ of oscillations , and thus it can be derived only through event spectra .",
    "hypothetical spectra of neutrino events as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath174 would be the most sensitive probes of @xmath85 . unfortunately",
    ", a complete kinematical closure of @xmath7-induced events can not be achieved in sk , so neither @xmath11 nor @xmath174 can be precisely reconstructed , especially for low - energy events .",
    "this intrinsic feature will eventually limit the maximum accuracy of @xmath85 fits attainable with sk data only . in this respect ,",
    "the possibility of improving the @xmath11 and @xmath174 reconstruction in experiments as soudan2 @xcite ( through observation of the struck nucleon ) , or in high - density detectors as proposed in @xcite , appears extremely interesting and promising .",
    "long baseline ( lbl ) accelerator experiments , such as k2k @xcite , minos @xcite , and various cern - gran  sasso proposals @xcite , are expected to confirm the atmospheric neutrino signal with a controlled beam . since both two - flavor @xcite and three - flavor analyses like ours show that @xmath85 can be as low as @xmath252 ( 99% c.l . ) , the design of low - energy beams should be pursued seriously . if the atmospheric @xmath85 range can be covered completely , then it suffices to have either a @xmath21 disappearance or a @xmath121 appearance signal to confirm the sk anomaly .    however , we think that long baseline experiments should be designed to _ measure _ oscillation parameters , rather than merely _ to confirm _ an oscillation effect already found by sk .",
    "measuring the oscillation parameters is a task that demands careful considerations , especially if @xmath8 oscillations are to be tested ( for @xmath92 oscillations , see the lucid discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath85 requires energy spectra analyses , and thus high - statistics event samples .",
    "if @xmath85 happens to be in the low range of the experimental sensitivity , the @xmath249 appearance sample might consist of just a handful of events .",
    "the @xmath1 appearance event sample might also be small if @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , a safe reconstruction of @xmath85 should be based mainly on @xmath0 event spectra from the @xmath254 disappearance channel , where most of the signal is expected in any case .",
    "this implies a good monitoring of the initial @xmath21 beam with a near detector .",
    "the determination of the matrix elements @xmath106 requires that several oscillation channels are probed at the same time ",
    "redundancy is never enough to constrain neutrino mixing @xcite .",
    "for instance , the @xmath254 disappearance channel is sensitive only to @xmath255 but tells nothing on @xmath256 or @xmath257 , while the @xmath258 appearance channel is sensitive to the product @xmath259 but it can not separate the two factors @xmath260 and @xmath261 nor measure @xmath103 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ p1],[p ] ) ] .",
    "these aspects of @xmath8 mixing tests @xcite in long - baseline experiments are better appreciated in fig .",
    "figure 18 shows , in the first column of triangles , the region allowed by sk+chooz for selected values of @xmath85 .",
    "the second column shows , superimposed , the prospective regions that can be probed at @xmath262 c.l .  by k2k @xcite , both in the @xmath254 channel ( slanted bands ) and in the @xmath40 channel ( hyperbola ) . in the @xmath263 disappearance channel or of the form @xmath264 in the @xmath265 appearance channel @xcite . ]",
    "it appears that k2k might not reach , in the @xmath40 channel , sufficient sensitivity to probe the values of @xmath103 allowed by sk+chooz .",
    "the disappearance channel @xmath254 can cover the whole sk+chooz region , but only for @xmath142 ev@xmath54 .",
    "therefore , k2k is basically expected to give information on @xmath255 for @xmath266 ev@xmath54 , given the sensitivities prospected in @xcite .    with respect to k2k ,",
    "the minos experiment is being designed to probe lower values of @xmath85 and to explore also the @xmath42 appearance channel ( the region below the hyperbola touching the @xmath42 side in fig .",
    "possible signals in the three channels @xmath267 will constrain the quantities @xmath268 , @xmath255 , and @xmath269 , respectively , so that the elements @xmath232 can be pinpointed for @xmath270 ev@xmath54 if the uncertainties are kept small . for lower @xmath85",
    "s , minos rapidly looses sensitivity in at least one of the oscillation channels , and it might be difficult to constrain the neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "notice that , for @xmath271 and the @xmath272 ( allowed by sk+chooz ) , the @xmath40 appearance probability is @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the oscillation factor in eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) , averaged over the @xmath7 beam energy spectrum .",
    "depending on @xmath275 and on the specific mixing parameters , values of @xmath276 as large as 15% appear possible in properly designed lbl experiments .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "the sensitivity regions in fig .",
    "18 have been derived from the prospective estimates reported in the experiment proposals @xcite , which are in continuous evolution ( even more so for the cern to gran sasso proposals @xcite , not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the above considerations on k2k and minos are to be considered as preliminary and qualitative .",
    "nevertheless , it remains true that lbl experiments might face some difficulties in constraining the @xmath8 mixing parameters , especially if @xmath85 is low or if the three oscillation channels @xmath267 can not all be probed .",
    "re - directing the goal of lbl experiments from `` confirming the super - kamiokande signal '' to `` measuring the parameters @xmath277 '' would be beneficial to the current debate on various lbl proposals .      in the limit @xmath216 [ eq .  ( [ appr ] ) ] , experiments with terrestrial ( atmospheric , accelerator and reactor ) neutrino beams probe the parameters @xmath278 . in the same approximation ,",
    "solar neutrino experiments probe the parameters @xmath279 , i.e. , the small mass square difference and the mass composition of @xmath5 @xcite .    therefore ,",
    "both terrestrial and solar @xmath7 experiments probe the element @xmath103 , which parametrizes the mixing of @xmath5 with the `` lone '' neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath79 .",
    "the effect of such mixing on solar neutrinos is to give an energy - independent contribution to the disappearance of @xmath5 s from the sun .",
    "since this contribution is basically proportional to the square of @xmath103 @xcite , sizable mixing is required to have large effects . however , as @xmath103 is constrained by the sk+chooz fit , such effects are relatively small to be detected in the current solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the smallness of @xmath103 also reduces the `` coupling '' of the terrestrial and solar parameter spaces @xcite .    nevertheless , it is interesting to notice that a preference for small values of @xmath103 emerges naturally from solar neutrino data only , in both matter - enhanced @xcite and vacuum @xcite three - flavor oscillation fits .",
    "an updated analysis using the latest sk solar neutrino data would be desirable to confirm such indication .",
    "in fact , a more pronounced preference of solar @xmath7 s for relatively small values of @xmath103 would be a nontrivial , although indirect , hint that both solar and terrestrial @xmath7 data are consistent within the same @xmath8 oscillation scenario .",
    "the relation between solar and atmospheric neutrinos is not necessarily confined to a preference for relatively small values of the mixing matrix element @xmath103 .",
    "for instance , if the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ appr ] ) is violated , atmospheric neutrinos can become sensitive to the subleading oscillations driven by @xmath77 , i.e. , by the `` solar neutrino '' mass difference .",
    "figure  19 shows a representative case beyond the @xmath216 approximation .",
    "the values chosen for the oscillation parameters @xmath280 are allowed at 99% c.l .  by the present sk+chooz bounds and by the pre - sk , three - flavor solar @xmath7 analysis in @xcite .",
    "the effect of the subdominant mass scale @xmath281 can be evaluated by comparing the solid curves ( @xmath282 ) and the dashed curves ( @xmath283 ) . of course , the effect is more significant when @xmath284 is larger , i.e. , for upgoing sg events , while it rapidly decreases at higher energies ( mg and up@xmath0 samples ) and shorter pathlengths ( @xmath285 ) .",
    "for sg@xmath0 events , however , the effect approaches the size of the error bars and thus it might be probed by sk !",
    "however , the strategies for disentangling the oscillations driven by @xmath85 and @xmath77 are nontrivial and will be investigated in a future work .",
    "theoretical or phenomenological models of neutrino mass and mixing try to predict , or `` explain , '' the set of parameters @xmath75 and @xmath286 .",
    "our analysis constrains the subset of parameters @xmath287 , provided that @xmath77 is sufficiently small ( @xmath288 ) .",
    "many models that try to explain solar+atmospheric @xmath7 data fall within this category , and are thus strongly constrained by the sk+chooz bounds worked out in this paper . for instance , the so - called bimaximal mixing model @xcite , characterized by @xmath289 for atmospheric neutrinos [ and by @xmath290 for solar neutrinos ] is allowed for @xmath291 ev@xmath54 ( see fig .",
    "conversely , the trimaximal mixing model @xcite , characterized by @xmath292 for atmospheric neutrinos [ and by @xmath293 for solar neutrinos ] appears to be strongly disfavored by our combined sk+chooz analysis ( it would correspond to the center of each triangle in figs .  14 and 15 ) .",
    "of course , many other models ( see , e.g. , the classification in @xcite ) can be tested through our bounds on the oscillation parameters , provided that the dominance of the mass scale @xmath85 is assumed for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "other models try to explain the atmospheric anomaly and the lsnd evidence @xcite for @xmath40 oscillations , with an allowance for an energy - averaged suppression of the solar neutrino flux .",
    "arguments disfavoring such scenarios are discussed in @xcite ( see , in particular , table  vi of @xcite and related comments ) .",
    "one such model has been recently proposed in @xcite , where @xmath294 ev@xmath54 is assumed to drive the oscillations in the lsnd experiment @xcite range , as well as energy - averaged oscillations of atmospheric @xmath7 s , while @xmath295@xmath130 ev@xmath54 is assumed to drive energy - dependent oscillations of atmospheric @xmath7 s . both @xmath77 and @xmath85",
    "can then contribute to the solar neutrino deficit through energy - averaged oscillations . since the bounds worked out in sec .",
    "v  d assume @xmath296 ev@xmath54 , and thus do not apply to such model , we have performed a numerical analysis of sk data _ ad hoc _ , using the same mass - mixing parameters as in @xcite .",
    "we find that the resulting zenith angle distributions of muons ( not shown ) are only mildly distorted , and that the model is disfavored by the sk atmospheric data at @xmath297 c.l . , with or without matter effects .",
    "we mention that , for the choice of parameters in @xcite , matter effects influence significantly the zenith distributions , making them flatter than in vacuum .",
    "the semi - quantitative calculations in @xcite showed a more optimistic agreement to the sk data , in part because matter effects were ignored .",
    "in addition , the large value for @xmath257 chosen in @xcite does not appear in agreement with the global analysis of laboratory neutrino oscillation searches ( including the lsnd data ) performed in @xcite .",
    "we have performed a three - flavor analysis of the sk atmospheric neutrino data , in a framework characterized by the mass - mixing parameters @xmath277 , in the hypothesis of one mass scale dominance .",
    "the variations of the zenith distributions of @xmath7 events in the presence of flavor oscillations have been investigated in detail .",

    "in particular , for @xmath85 close to ( or slightly below ) @xmath130 ev@xmath54 , @xmath103 can be as large as @xmath236 ( at 90% c.l . ) .",
    "scenarios with @xmath300 correspond to genuine three - flavor oscillations and are characterized by a rich phenomenology , not only for atmospheric @xmath7 s , but also for solar and laboratory neutrino oscillation searches . in particular , challenging opportunities are disclosed for @xmath5 appearance searches in long baseline experiments .",

    "the efficiency function @xmath303 is not always reported in the experimental papers .",

    ". we find good agreement with the sk estimate of the average scattering angle as a function of energy ( as reported in @xcite , p.  99 ) .",
    "concerning the neutrino fluxes , we refer to @xcite except for sg events , where we use the differential spectra from @xcite with geomagnetic corrections @xcite .",
    "since the distributions of parent neutrinos in @xcite are given in arbitrary units , we need to normalize the total area of our estimated sk lepton distributions ( sg and mg , in the absence of oscillations ) to the corresponding values simulated by the sk collaboration , as reported in table  i ( total rates ) . for sg events ,",
    "this renormalization compensates , in part , for the fact that we use low - energy @xmath7 fluxes from @xcite instead than from @xcite . of course , a more direct calculation of the sg and mg distributions ( avoiding the use of indirect information such as the parent @xmath7 distributions ) is preferable ; we intend to perform such calculation when the sk efficiency function @xmath309 will be made publicly available . in any case",

    "we are confident that our calculations of the zenith distributions represent a satisfactory approximation ( not a substitute , of course ) of the sk simulations . improvements of our calculations for the sg amd mg samples are possible ( with a more accurate knowledge of the sk detector efficiency ) but do not appear to be decisive at present , in view of the good agreement reported in fig .  20 and of the relatively large theoretical uncertainties discussed in the following appendix .",
    "fitting histograms is a delicate task . in general , the predictions in any two bins are correlated , and ignoring such correlations typically leads to significant variations in the allowed ranges for the fit parameters .",
    "concerning the sk zenith distributions , this problem adds to the difficulty of evaluating the size of uncertainties associated to the theoretical neutrino flux calculations and to the neutrino cross section , as well as the variations of such uncertainties in terms of the neutrino energy and direction .",
    "there is no easy solution to such problems , other than continually improving the calculations , understanding the role and the uncertainties of any input parameter , and removing as many approximations as possible @xcite .",
    "cosmic ray experiments can also help to constrain the models of atmospheric showers .",
    "the confidence in the estimated cross sections might benefit from a resurgence of experimental interest for low - energy neutrino interactions . in the meantime",
    ", it is wise to adopt conservative error estimates .    for each of the 30 sk zenith bins @xmath310 used in the analysis",
    ", we take the experimental statistical error @xmath311 from tables  i and ii .",
    "the @xmath312 statistical error matrix @xmath313 simply reads @xmath314 . as a global systematic error @xmath315 for each bin , we assume conservatively @xmath39 of the theoretical prediction ( with or without oscillations ) .",
    "the systematic error matrix is then @xmath316 , where the correlation matrix @xmath317 is evaluated as follows .",
    "if the systematic uncertainties @xmath315 had a single , common origin such as an overall normalization uncertainty , then the bin values @xmath318 s would be fully correlated ( @xmath319 ) and the systematics would cancel in any bin ratio @xmath320 .",
    "however , the presence of several sources of uncertainties implies that @xmath321 and that the ratio @xmath320 is affected by a residual uncertainty @xmath322 where all @xmath302 s represent fractional errors . for @xmath323",
    "the above relation can be inverted to give @xmath324 which allows to estimate @xmath317 from the ratio error .",
    "for instance , if @xmath318 refers to downgoing sg @xmath1-like events and @xmath325 to the corresponding @xmath0-like events , with a @xmath26 uncertainty of , say , @xmath25 , the corresponding correlation index is @xmath326 @xcite .",
    "the task is then reduced to the evaluation of the most important sources of errors for the ratios @xmath320 . the total error for the @xmath26 flavor ratio ( including the theoretical uncertainties and the experimental misidentification )",
    "is conservatively estimated to be @xmath327 for sg events and @xmath328 for mg events in @xcite . for bins of equal flavor ,",
    "one expects an additional energy - dependent uncertainty in the ratio @xmath320 due to uncertainties in the neutrino energy spectrum slope .",
    "in fact , by comparing the relative rates of sg , mg , and up@xmath0 events calculated with different input fluxes ( either @xcite or @xcite ) , we find typical ratio errors of @xmath25 for @xmath329 and @xmath330 , and of @xmath331 for @xmath332 , i.e. , errors increasing with the relative difference between the mean energies of the event samples .",
    "finally , one expects also angular - dependent errors for @xmath320 , that we estimate to be at most @xmath25 when the difference between @xmath333 and @xmath334 is maximal ( ratio of vertical to horizontal direction bins ) .",
    "qualitatively , all this means that the correlation between any two bins decreases from unity as the bins are more separated in energy , angle , and flavor , thus giving to the theoretical distributions some freedom to vary their shape .",
    "quantitatively , we formalize the above estimates by generalizing eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) as @xmath335 where @xmath336 , and : ( i ) @xmath337 is the `` flavor - dependent uncertainty , '' equal to 10% for bins of different flavors and zero otherwise ; ( ii ) @xmath338 is the `` energy - dependent uncertainty , '' equal to zero for bins @xmath339 belonging to the same sample ( sg , mg , or up ) , to 5% for bins @xmath339 of the kind ( sg , mg ) or ( mg , up ) , and to 10% for bins",

    "for instance , the first bin of the sg@xmath1 distribution and the last bin of the up@xmath0 distribution have the lowest correlation , @xmath344 , since they are the most distant in energy , flavor , and direction .",

    "lowering its value from our present choice ( 10% , comparable to the estimates in table  ii of @xcite ) to a few percent would shrink significantly the allowed regions but would also worsen the best fit . a reduction of this and other systematics would greatly improve the statistical power of oscillation hypothesis tests .",

    "<S> we present a detailed analysis of the zenith angle distributions of atmospheric neutrino events observed in the super - kamiokande ( sk ) underground experiment , assuming two - flavor and three - flavor oscillations ( with one dominant mass scale ) among active neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the five angular distributions associated to sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath0-like and @xmath1-like events and to upward through - going muons , for a total of 30 accurately computed observables ( zenith bins ) . </S>",
    "<S> first we study how such observables vary with the oscillation parameters , and then we perform a fit to the experimental data as measured in sk for an exposure of 33 kty ( 535 days ) . in the two - flavor mixing case , we confirm the results of the sk collaboration analysis , namely , that @xmath2 oscillations are preferred over @xmath3 , and that the no oscillation case is excluded with high confidence . in the three - flavor mixing case </S>",
    "<S> , we perform our analysis with and without the additional constraints imposed by the chooz reactor experiment . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the analysis favors a dominance of the @xmath2 channel . without the chooz constraints , the amplitudes of the subdominant @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions </S>",
    "<S> can also be relatively large , indicating that , at present , current sk data do not exclude sizable @xmath5 mixing by themselves . </S>",
    "<S> after combining the chooz and sk data , the amplitudes of the subdominant transitions are constrained to be smaller , but they can still play a nonnegligible role both in atmospheric and other neutrino oscillation searches . in particular , we find that the @xmath5 appearance probability expected in long baseline experiments can reach the testable level of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss earth matter effects , theoretical uncertainties , and various aspects of the statistical analysis . </S>"
