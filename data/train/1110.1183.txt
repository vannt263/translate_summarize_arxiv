    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates@xcite , many strongly correlated models have been intensively studied .",
    "one of the simplest of these is the @xmath0-@xmath1 model@xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron operator defined in the no - double - occupancy subspace .",
    "this model can be derived from the strong - coupling limit of the hubbard model . despite its simplicity and extensive study , the nature of the ground states of eq .",
    "is still controversial .",
    "a strong correlation view of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model was advanced by anderson , who conjectured the relevance of a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state@xcite as a low energy state for eq .   when doped . when undoped , the rvb state is a spin singlet , with no symmetry breaking , and describes a `` quantum spin liquid '' . at low temperature the mobile carriers in the doped rvb state",
    "behave as bosons and condense , forming a state indistinguishable in terms of symmetry from a singlet bcs superconductor .",
    "a further development was the introduction of a projected mean - field wavefunction  the projection removing all components of the wavefunction with doubly occupied sites  which could be used variationally@xcite    presently , this variational method remains one of the few numerical tools to study @xmath0-@xmath1 like models which work directly at @xmath4 and can treat significant system sizes .",
    "however , due to the special form of the variational wavefunction , one may be concerned about bias : very general states in the low energy subspace can not be investigated .",
    "recently new numerical tools have been developed to investigate much more general low energy states in @xmath0-@xmath1 like models beyond the projective method .",
    "one novel construction builds tensor product states ( tpss)@xcite , which can be conveniently studied and have been applied to many spin systems@xcite .",
    "this new class of variational states do not assume any specifical ordering pattern a priori and can describe very general states as long as their entanglement entropy satisfy perimeter law .",
    "recently , this method has been generalized to fermionic systems@xcite . among many different generalizations ,",
    "the grassmann tensor product states ( gtpss)@xcite were shown to be closely related to projective states .",
    "they are able to describe a class of projective wavefunctions faithfully , including in particular the short - range rvb states .",
    "the tps and gtps construction is particularly well suited to trivalent lattices , the simplest of which is the honeycomb lattice in two dimensions . like the square lattice appropriate for the cuprates , the honeycomb lattice is bipartite and naturally supports an antiferromagnetic ( af ) state at half - filling in the strong coupling ( heisenberg ) limit .",
    "similarities to cuprate physics may be expected . moreover ,",
    "several numerical studies have identified a possible quantum spin liquid state on this lattice at half - filling when additional quantum fluctuations are included in the hubbard@xcite and heisenberg@xcite models .",
    "thus the doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model on the honeycomb lattice seems a promising venue to explore rvb ideas .    here",
    ", we investigate the ground state of this system using the recently developed gtps approach .",
    "the gtps results are benchmarked by comparison with exact diagonalization ( ed ) and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "our results are systematically consistent with these non - variational , exact methods on small clusters .",
    "the principle result of the gtps calculations is that the ground state at non - zero doping is a time reversal symmetry breaking @xmath5 wave superconductor .",
    "some physical rationale for this result are given at the end of this letter .     and",
    "@xmath6 , which contain @xmath7 are defined on the sublattices @xmath8 and @xmath9 for each unit cell .",
    "the grassmann metric @xmath10 containing @xmath11 is defined on the links that connect the grassmann tensors @xmath12 and @xmath6 .",
    "the blue lines represent the fermion parity even indices while the red lines represent the fermion parity odd indices of the virtual states .",
    "notice an arrow from @xmath8 to @xmath9 represents the ordering convention @xmath13 that we use for the grassmann metric.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]",
    "* the variational ansatz : * we use the standard form of gtps as our variational wavefunction . we further assume a translationally invariant ansatz , and thus is specified by just two different grassmann tensors @xmath14 on sublattice @xmath15 of each unit cell : @xmath16 with @xmath17 we notice the symbol @xmath18 means tensor contraction of the inner indices @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 are the grassmann numbers and dual grassmann numbers , respectively , defined on the link @xmath21 , which satisfy the grassmann algebra : @xmath22 as shown in fig.[fig : grassmanntps ] , @xmath23 are the virtual indices carrying a fermion parity @xmath24 . in this paper , we choose @xmath25 to be even and assume there are _ equal _ numbers of fermion parity even / odd indices , which might be not necessary in general . those indices with odd parity",
    "are always associated with a grassmann number on the corresponding link and the metric @xmath26 is the grassmann generalization of the canonical delta function .",
    "the complex coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the variational parameters .    notice that @xmath29 is the physical index of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on site @xmath30 , which can take three different values , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , representing the hole , spin - up electron and spin - down electron states .",
    "we choose the hole representation in our calculations , and thus the hole state has an odd parity @xmath33 while the electron states have even parity @xmath34 .",
    "on each site , the non - zero components of the grassmann tensors should satisfy the parity conservation constraint : @xmath35 since the wavefunction eq.([gtps ] ) does not have a definite fermion number , we use the grand canonical ensemble , adding a chemical potential term to eq.([tj ] ) to control the average hole concentration .",
    "we use the imaginary time evolution method@xcite to update the gtps from a random state .",
    "then we use the weighted grassmann - tensor - entanglement renormalization group ( wgterg ) method@xcite to calculate physical quantities.(see methods section for details . )",
    "the total system size ranges up to @xmath36 sites and all calculations are performed with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the largest virtual dimension of the gtps considered was @xmath37 . to ensure convergence of the wterg method",
    ", we kept @xmath38 ( defined in refs .",
    "@xcite ) up to @xmath39 for @xmath40 , which gave relative errors for physical quantities of order @xmath41 . for @xmath42",

    "* ground state energy and staggered magnetization : * at half - filling , the @xmath0-@xmath1 model reduces to the heisenberg model . in this case",
    ", we find the converged ground state energies per site are @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath42(the term @xmath47 is subtracted here ) , which is consistent with previous tps study@xcite ( with virtual dimension @xmath48 and @xmath49 , since all the components of gtps with odd fermion parity virtual indices vanish in this case ) and a recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) result @xmath50 . despite good agreement with the ground state energy ,",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath51 obtained from our calculations is larger than the qmc result @xmath52 .",
    "we find @xmath53 for @xmath45 and @xmath54 for @xmath42 , also consistent with the previous tps study@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that the variational approach indeed obtains the correct phase .",
    "actually , a recent study for square lattice heisenberg model shows @xmath51 can be consistent with the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) result if @xmath25 is sufficient large@xcite .",
    "much more interesting physics arises after we dope the system.(we consider @xmath55 ) . as seen in fig.[fig : energy ] , the ground state energy shows a marked increase in @xmath25 dependence with increasing hole doping @xmath56 . as a benchmark , we perform the ed and dmrg calculations for small periodic clusters with @xmath57 sites ( @xmath58 for ed and @xmath59 for dmrg ) .",
    "these two methods are the only unbiased methods for frustrated systems that avoid the sign problem , but are restricted to relatively small systems .",
    "to ensure the convergence of the dmrg , we keep up to @xmath60 states and make the truncation errors less than @xmath61 in our @xmath62 calculations . up to @xmath45 , we find a systematic convergence of the ground energy .",
    "some data points around @xmath63 for @xmath42 have slightly higher energy than @xmath45 , because @xmath64 is still not large enough for convergence at @xmath42 .    as shown in the insert of fig.[fig : energy ] , the staggered magnetization @xmath51 has an even larger @xmath25 dependence than energy at finite doping",
    ". however , up to @xmath42 , the data appears to converge to a relatively well - defined curve indicating vanishing af order for @xmath65 .",
    "* superconductivity : * next we turn to the interesting question of whether the doped antiferromagnetic mott insulator on the honeycomb lattice supports superconductivity , and if so , what its pairing symmetry is . to answer this",
    ", we calculate the real space superconducting ( sc ) order parameters in the spin singlet channel @xmath66 , where @xmath30 and @xmath67 are nearest neighboring sites.because we use a chemical potential to control the hole concentration , the charge @xmath68 symmetry can be spontaneous broken in the variational approach , which allows @xmath69 to be directly measured rather than through its two - point correlation function . as shown in the main panel of fig.[fig : sc ] , up to @xmath70 we find a non - zero singlet sc order parameter for the whole region .",
    "strikingly , we find that the sc state breaks time reversal symmetry . by measuring the sc order parameters for the three inequivalent nearest - neighbor bonds",
    ", we found @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "this pairing symmetry is usually called @xmath5 wave . to exclude the possibility that this results from trapping in a unstable local minimum , we repeated the calculations with many different random tensors , and all cases converged to the same results .",
    "moreover , we also checked that the sc order parameter vanishes at large @xmath73 to make sure that the existing of sc order is consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.(for @xmath74 , the critical value is around @xmath75 at @xmath76 )    the existence of sc order is observed in our numerical study up to @xmath77 .",
    "however , a much larger inner dimension @xmath25 is required for the convergence of ground state energy at larger hole concentration , which is beyond the scope of this paper.(the gtps variational ansatz we use in this paper is designed to help us understand the nature of mott physics ; at large doping , the mott physics becomes less important and can be studied much better by other methods . )    * coexisting phases at low doping : * interestingly , we find the sc and af order coexisting in the regime @xmath78 .",
    "a physical consequence of the microscopic coexistance is that triplet pairing is induced .",
    "the insert of fig.[fig : sc ] shows the amplitude of the triplet order parameter as a function of doping .",
    "since the triplet pairing order parameter has three independent components @xmath79(here @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the phase of sc order parameter . )",
    ", we can define the amplitude of triplet order parameter as @xmath83 .",
    "the phase shift of @xmath84 on the three inequivalent bonds is also observed for all the triplet components .",
    "we further check the internal spin direction of the triplet @xmath85 vector and find it is always anti - parallel to the neel vector(@xmath86 ) . at larger doping @xmath87 ,",
    "the triplet order parameter has a very strong @xmath25 dependence , so at present we are unable to determine whether it ultimately vanishes or remains non - zero in the @xmath88 limit .",
    "we leave this issue for future work . by fully using all symmetry quantum numbers and other techniques like high performance simulation on gpus ,",
    "we can in principle handle @xmath25 up to @xmath89 .",
    "the calculations in this paper by construction ignore any possible phases breaking translational symmetry .",
    "natural candidates are spiral or striped anti - ferromagnetic phases , as have been heavily discussed for the square lattice .",
    "a weak coupling perspective suggests this may be unlikely .    in the weak - coupling limit of hubbard model on honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the system is a semimetal with two dirac cones . with a non - zero hubbard @xmath90 , commensurate af fluctuations at zero momentum manifest in the inter - band susceptibility , becoming stronger and stronger with increasing @xmath90 . at sufficiently large u",
    "commensurate af order develops ( recent numerics find a narrow region of intermediate spin liquid phase@xcite ) . at small but finite doping",
    ", the dirac cones become pockets . in this case , the total intra - band spin susceptibility shows a constant behavior for small @xmath91(@xmath92)@xcite while the total inter - band spin susceptibility still peaks at zero momentum .",
    "thus , we argue the commensurate af fluctuations at zero momentum still dominate for sufficient small hole concentration .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    our dmrg and ed calculations also support this argument . up to 54 sites",
    ", we do not find any evidence of incommensurate spin - spin correlation .",
    "fig.[fig : compare ] shows the comparison of dmrg calculations and gtps calculations for staggered magnetization @xmath51 on small systems .",
    "we find the gtps results are comparable with extrapolations of @xmath51 for infinite size systems ( the gtps results for @xmath51 are somewhat larger close to half - filling due to insufficient tensor dimension @xmath25 ) .",
    "this agreement also implies our variational wavefunction is very close to the true ground state .",
    "a more general concern is whether the gtps tends to overestimate sc order at large doping , due to its non - conservation of charge(note that the projected wavefunction approach has a rather strong tendency to produce superconducting states ) .",
    "the observed sc order parameter is `` small '' in terms of the natural upper limit @xmath93 .",
    "nevertheless , our results are consistent with other approaches : ( a ) in the mean field theory for the honeycomb @xmath94 model , only the @xmath5 pairing channel gains energy@xcite , and ( b ) in the weak coupling limit of hubbard model , very recent renormalization group studies also find @xmath5 superconductivity around quarter filling@xcite .    in conclusion , we report the theoretical discovery of a @xmath5 wave superconducting state in @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a honeycomb lattice , based on a recently developed variational method - the gtps approach . at low doping , af ordering coexists with the sc ordering . in the coexistance regime ,",
    "a spin triplet pairing with the same phase shift is induced and its triplet @xmath95 vector is anti - parallel with the neel vector",
    ". it would be interesting to search for this physics in experiment .",
