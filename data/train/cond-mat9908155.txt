    "advanced experimental techniques have emerged which allow one to endow solid surfaces with stable geometrical structures which display a well - defined design on the scale of nanometers or micrometers .",
    "lateral geometric structures can be formed by using various lithographic techniques such as , e.g. , holographic @xcite , x - ray ( liga ) @xcite , soft @xcite , and nanosphere lithography @xcite .",
    "these microfabrication techniques provide routes to high - quality patterns and structures with lateral dimensions down to tens of nm .",
    "these structures are either periodic in one lateral direction consisting of grooves with various shapes of the cross section ( e.g. , wedgelike ) or they display periodicity in both lateral dimensions .",
    "these man - made surfaces offer a wide range of possible applications if they are exposed to fluids . in that case the surfaces act as a template with designed topography which imposes specified lateral structures on a fluid .",
    "for example in the context of microfluidics @xcite these geometrical structures can be used as guiding systems in order to deliver tiny amounts of valuable liquids to designated analysis centers on a solid surface as part of microscopic chemical factories @xcite .",
    "besides the numerous experimental challenges associated with these systems there is also the theoretical challenge to understand the corresponding highly inhomogeneous fluid structures ( and ultimately the flow dynamics ) as well as to guide the design on the basis of this insight @xcite .    in view of this goal",
    "the study of the fluid structures in a single wedgelike groove with opening angle @xmath2 serves as a paradigmatic first step .",
    "for @xmath3 the geometry reduces to the well studied case of a planar substrate . for decreasing values of @xmath2 the fluid",
    "is squeezed whereas for @xmath4 a ridgelike solid perturbation is projected into the fluid . due to the unbound accessible space for all values of @xmath2",
    "the bulk properties of the fluid are unchanged by the presence of the wedge .",
    "( this is an important difference as compared with pores in which the confinement alters the bulk properties . ) at low temperatures one finds pronounced packing effects for the fluid particles near the corner of the wedge which differ significantly from those encountered at planar surfaces @xcite .",
    "even stronger effects occur if the wedge is exposed to a vapor phase . in this case",
    "a liquid - like meniscus is formed at the bottom of the wedge which undergoes a filling transition at a temperature @xmath5 _ below _ the wetting transition temperature @xmath6 of the corresponding planar substrate @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that x - ray scattering experiments at grazing incidence are capable of resolving such interfacial structures @xcite .",
    "if the temperature is increased sufficiently above the triple point of the fluid one encounters its bulk critical point @xmath7",
    ". this can be either the liquid - vapor critical point of the fluid or the demixing critical point if the fluid is a binary liquid mixture .",
    "the experience with planar surfaces tells @xcite that at bulk criticality the confinement triggers interesting new surface critical phenomena . in this case",
    "the local order parameter @xmath8 is perturbed near the surface within a layer whose thickness is governed by the diverging bulk correlation length @xmath9 where @xmath10 ; @xmath11 denotes the universal bulk critical exponent and @xmath12 is the nonuniversal amplitude above @xmath13 and below @xmath14 @xmath7 .",
    "thus at @xmath7 the perturbation due to the surface intrudes deeply into the bulk .    in order to extend our knowledge of the structure of confined fluids to these elevated temperatures we set out to investigate the aforementioned surface critical phenomena in a wedge . based on analytic calculations @xcite and computer simulations @xcite",
    "the local critical behavior in a wedge has been analyzed for the case that the corresponding planar surface exhibits the so - called _ ordinary _ or _ special _ surface phase transitions @xcite . in the corresponding magnetic language",
    "the ordinary phase transition corresponds to the case that the couplings between the surface spins remain below the threshold value of the multicritical special transition beyond which the surface can support long - ranged order even above @xmath7 @xcite and in which there are no surface fields .",
    "the ordinary transition has also been studied for different shapes of the confinement such as parabolic ones @xcite .",
    "the main concern of these studies has been critical edge exponents describing the leading critical behavior of the order parameter near the corner where it differs from that at planar surfaces and in the bulk .",
    "one finds that in general the edge exponents depend on the opening angle @xmath2 .",
    "these studies aim at describing magnetic systems in the absence of surface fields as they are experimental accessible , e.g. , by scanning electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "however , the aforementioned surface and edge universality classes are not applicable in the present context of confined fluids .",
    "for example , in a binary liquid mixture one of the two species will prefer the confining substrate more than the other which results in an effective surface field acting on the order parameter given by the concentration difference between the two species .",
    "similar arguments hold for a one - component fluid near liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "these surface fields give rise to another surface universality class , the so - called _ normal _ transition @xcite .",
    "it differs from the ordinary and special transitions discussed above in that these symmetry breaking surface fields generate a nontrivial order parameter profile even if the bulk is in the disordered phase , i.e. , for @xmath15 . for a planar surface",
    "this gives rise to the well studied so - called _ critical adsorption _",
    "phenomenon ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . ) here we extend the corresponding field - theoretical analysis for the normal transition to the wedge geometry under consideration .",
    "after presenting our model and discussing general scaling properties ( sec.[secii ] ) we analyze the order parameter profile in sec.[seciii ] and the structure factor in sec.[seciv ] . by focusing on the critical temperature @xmath16 we are able to obtain analytical results .",
    "they are summarized in sec.[summary ] .",
    "appendices [ appa ] and [ appb ] contain important technical details needed in secs.[seciii ] and [ seciv ] .",
    "experimentally , wedges are characterized by a finite depth @xmath17 . moreover , in many cases they are manufactured as a laterally periodic array of parallel grooves and ridges .",
    "the structural properties of a fluid exposed to such a periodic array sensitively depends on the ratio @xmath18 of the depth and the correlation length . for @xmath19",
    "the system will resemble a critical fluid exposed to a mildly corrugated substrate which is expected to give rise to corrections to the leading critical adsorption behavior at a planar substrate . for @xmath20 near the tip of a ridge and near the bottom of a groove the presence of their periodic duplicates becomes irrelevant so that in this limit the edge singularity of a single edge with @xmath4 and @xmath21 , respectively , will prevail .",
    "our present study deals with the limit @xmath22 and @xmath23 taken such that @xmath20 .",
    "certainly , in a later stage it will be rather rewarding to study also the crossover regime @xmath24 in which the grooves and the ridges as well as the way they are joined together play an equally important role .",
    "the occurrence of the unbending transition in the case of wetting on corrugated substrates @xcite indicates that the regime @xmath24 might exhibit rather interesting new phenomena .",

    "one of our motivations for the investigation of criticality in the wedge geometry is the frequent use of grooved substrates as templates to impose inhomogeneous structures on liquids . in the wedge geometry",
    "the density ( or concentration ) of the adsorbed critical fluid is inhomogeneous within planes perpendicular to the edge .",
    "the intersection of these planes with surfaces of constant order parameter @xmath157 renders the contour lines @xmath158 of the order parameter profile , which characterize the inhomogeneous shape of the order parameter configuration in the wedge .",

    "as expected , the deviation of the contour lines from these parallel straight lines is largest in the center of the wedge . the normalized order parameter profile defined by the lhs of eq.([mpmmhalf ] )",
