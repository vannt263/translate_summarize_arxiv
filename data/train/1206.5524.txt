    "the mathematical theory of adaptive algorithms for approximating the solution of multidimensional elliptic pdes is rather recent .",
    "the first convergence results of adaptive finite element methods ( afem ) have been proved by drfler @xcite and morin , nochetto , and siebert @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the first convergence rates were derived by cohen , dahmen , and devore @xcite for wavelets in any dimensions @xmath2 , and for finite element methods ( afem ) by binev , dahmen , and devore @xcite for @xmath3 and stevenson @xcite for any @xmath2 .",
    "the most comprehensive results for afem are those of cascn , kreuzer , nochetto , and siebert @xcite for any @xmath2 and @xmath4 data , and cohen , devore , and nochetto @xcite for @xmath3 and @xmath5 data .",
    "the key result of this theory is that afem delivers a convergence rate compatible with that of the approximation classes where the solution and data belong .",
    "the recent results in @xcite reveal that it is the approximation class of the solution that really matters .",
    "however , in all the above cases ( wavelets and fem ) the convergence rates are limited by the approximation power of the method , which is finite and related to the polynomial degree of the basis functions or the number of their vanishing moments , as well as the regularity of the solution and data .",
    "a similar study for adaptive high - order methods ( such as spectral element methods or @xmath6 finite element methods ) has started only recently and very few results are available .",
    "the ultimate goal is to design algorithms which _ optimally _ choose between @xmath7-refinement and @xmath8-enrichment , and for which a rigorous mathematical proof of rate of convergence and optimality can be given .",
    "this is a formidable task which requires , , the study of sparsity classes tailored to functions which are ( locally ) infinitely smooth .",
    "some rigorous mathematical results on the convergence of @xmath6-methods for pdes have been established in @xcite .",
    "although the numerical implementations of adaptive @xmath6 methods has now reached high levels of efficiency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the theoretical study of optimality has never been addressed .",
    "a first step in this direction has been accomplished in @xcite , where the contraction and the optimal cardinality properties of adaptive fourier - galerkin methods in a periodic box in @xmath9 with dimension @xmath10 are presented together with the analysis of suitable nonlinear approximation classes ( the classical one corresponding algebraic decay of the fourier coefficients and another one associated exponential decay ) .",
    "the present paper represents a second step towards the study of optimality for high - order methods . we extend the method and",
    "the results contained in @xcite to a non - periodic setting in one dimension .",
    "this is the closest situation to the periodic case , since an orthonormal basis is readily available ( the so called babuka - shen basis formed by the anti - derivatives of the legendre polynomials ) ; together with the associated dual basis , it allows one to represent the norm of a function or a functional as a @xmath11-type norm of the vector of its coefficients .",
    "in addition , the stiffness matrix for smooth coefficients of the differential operator exhibits a quasi - sparsity behavior , i.e. , an exponential decay of its entries as one goes away from the diagonal .    in this paper",
    "we only consider the case of an exponential decay of the best approximation error of the solution of the pde ; indeed this is the most relevant situation which motivates the use of a spectral/@xmath8 method .",
    "our approach relies on a careful analysis of the relation between the sparsity class of a function and the sparsity class of its image through the differential operator .",
    "as already pointed out in the analysis of the fourier method @xcite , the discrepancy between the sparsity classes of the residual and the exact solution suggests the introduction of a coarsening step that guarantees the optimality of the computed approximation at the end of each adaptive iteration .    the multi - dimensional situation , which poses additional difficulties , is currently under investigation .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , be the @xmath15-th legendre orthogonal polynomial in @xmath16 , which satisfies @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 furthermore , we denote by @xmath20 the elements of the orthonormal _ legendre basis _ in @xmath21 ,",
    "which satisfy @xmath22 we denote by @xmath23 the first derivative operator .",

    "( bs basis ) , whose elements are defined as @xmath25 they satisfies @xmath26 and @xmath27 thus , the @xmath28 s satisfy @xmath29 i.e. , they form an orthonormal basis for the @xmath30-inner product .",
    "equivalently , the ( semi - infinite ) stiffness matrix @xmath31 of the babuka - shen basis with respect to this inner product is the identity matrix @xmath32 . on the other hand",
    ", one has @xmath33 which means that the mass matrix @xmath34 is pentadiagonal .",
