    "one of the first steps to study the pairing mechanism in unconventional superconductors is the characterization of the superconducting state with respect to its orbital symmetry and phase .",
    "whereas in conventional superconductors the superconductivity is based on an effective coupling mediated by lattice distortions , in the case of high @xmath3 superconductors we expect electronic correlations to be responsible of the pairing@xcite , leading to characteristic variations of the energy gap along the fermi surface@xcite .",
    "thus , the corresponding order parameter , which describes the momentum dependent coupling strength between the electrons within one cooper pair , shows a variation in momentum space indicating strong correlations taking place over rather short distances .",
    "moreover , while the sc gap function of conventional superconductors has the same phase throughout momentum space ( @xmath4 wave symmetry ) , that of correlation mediated superconductors is expected to exhibit a sign reversal between those fermi momenta connected by characteristic wave vector @xmath5 of spin fluctuations@xcite . in @xmath6 wave superconductors , the nodal planes of the order parameter intersect with the fermi surface , leading to gapless quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations that can be detected thermodynamically and by low energy probes .",
    "however , a sign reversal of the sc order parameter can also occur ( without the presence of nodal excitations ) between disconnected hole and electron pockets resulting in an @xmath0 symmetry@xcite .",
    "this scenario is expected in most of the iron - based superconductors , and there the relative sign change of sc gap must be determined by phase - sensitive experiments such as josephson junctions experiments@xcite , composite sc loops@xcite , and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite . of particular interest in this context is the material lifeas since experiments have proven an absence of nesting@xcite and theoretical works yield contradictory results ; i.e. , both different configurations of @xmath4-wave singlet@xcite as well as @xmath2-wave triplet pairing have been suggested@xcite .    in general , the correct interpretation of phase - sensitive experiments requires detailed information about the low energy properties of the material , like for example the normal state band structure , correlations , or the type of impurity scattering . moreover , in pnictide superconductors it is well known that the orbital physics play a very important role , in particular , the variation of orbit content along the fermi surface . in most cases it is the insufficient knowledge about these properties which prevents the characterization of the superconducting state directly from measured spectra .",
    "time reversal symmetry breaking of the system by use of an external magnetic field , which is known to enhance the qp excitations with preserved sign of sc order parameter@xcite , is one possible way to overcome these problems .",
    "recently , this method has been applied to the iron - based superconductor fe(se , te)@xcite and results of this study have been considered as evidence for @xmath0 pairing in this material . however , this interpretation raised a number of comments@xcite , as for example the field effect in iron - based superconductors is expected to differ significantly from the one observed in cuprates .",
    "moreover , in this material , the zeeman splitting is a large fraction of the superconducting gap size , generating new components to the field induced scattering@xcite .    very recently",
    ", we have shown that resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) appears as an additional experimental method which is sensitive to phase and orbital symmetry of sc order parameters@xcite . in the past decade , this spectroscopic technique has established as an experimental probe of elementary spin  @xcite , orbital  @xcite , and lattice excitations  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the direct rixs process@xcite allows spin flip excitations if the spin of conduction electrons has components parallel to the @xmath7 orbital@xcite .",
    "this fact offers the possibility to probe the momentum - dependent charge and spin dynamical structure factors @xmath8 of the bulk system@xcite where the corresponding form factors can be adjusted by the specific geometry of the experiment and the polarization of the incoming photon beam .",
    "the well known property of the spin - spin correlation function @xmath9 to enhance sign reversing scattering , leading for example to the famous 41 mev resonant mode in cuprates , would place the rixs experiment ( applied to the iron - based superconductors ) on the same footing as the qp interference in magnetic field  with the additional advantage that the interpretation of spectroscopic features does not rely on the modeling of impurity scattering .",
    "how effective are these arguments in the presence of a strong variation of orbital content along the fermi surface and to what extent we can expect signatures of the superconducting order parameter phase in the spectra ?    in the following will will investigate the rixs response of iron - based superconductors at an energy scale that corresponds roughly to the superconducting gap .",
    "previously the fe l@xmath10-edge rixs response of such systems at higher loss - energies , corresponding to the magnetic and orbital excitations has been studied theoretically@xcite , establishing that magnon excitations , predominantly composed of a single orbital component , can be seen in experiments , with a spectral weight that is smaller than spin - flipped interorbital excitations at still higher energies .",
    "this theoretical work stimulated a subsequent experimental study@xcite , which not only confirmed the presence of the magnon excitations in an energy range up to an energy of 200 mev in magnetically ordered iron - pnictides@xcite , but also revealed the persistence of magnon - like modes in this energy range as the material is doped and becomes superconducting .",
    "this connects fe pnictides to cuprates , for which , in spite of fundamental electronic structure differences , similar paramagnons are present@xcite .",
    "it also motivates the question whether and how rixs can pick up the signatures of the superconducting gap in the iron - based superconducturs .",
    "such excitations are on an energy - scale that is about an order of magnitude smaller than the 200 mev of the magnon dispersion , so that measuring them will be a challenge for rixs experiments in the years to come  here we will set the stage for such experiments from a theoretical perspective .    motivated by the above considerations this paper develops a phenomenological approach to the momentum and energy dependent rixs spectrum in iron - based superconductors , taking into account the relevant orbitals of the iron ions and their different weights along the hole and electron pockets . using tight - binding models , derived from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , for the band structure of two important pnictide representatives laofeas and lifeas we calculate the dynamical structure factors of charge and spin for different scenarios of superconducting pairing .",
    "our study shows that the orbital content along the fermi surface leads to strong suppression of spectral intensity for excitations combining orthogonal orbital states . despite this strong effect",
    "we find that a sign change between hole and electron pocket ( @xmath0 wave ) can still be detected by rixs .",
    "in particular we show that sign reversing excitations appear as strong intensity peak in the spin sensitive spectrum at the characteristic wave vector @xmath5 of spin fluctuations . moreover , based on these considerations , we present a way how rixs could detect the presence of possible triplet pairing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : theo ] , we develop the theory to calculate superconducting qp excitations in systems with more than one relevant orbitals close to the fermi level .",
    "a comparison of results for different types of modeling based on the orbital model and the corresponding energy band model , where the orbital variation is neglected , is shown in [ sec : laofeas ] .",
    "we then apply our theory to the compound lifeas and present in [ sec : lifeas ] calculated rixs spectra where we assume different types of superconducting pairing ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 wave ) .",
    "we conclude in [ sec : con ] .",
    "in a _ direct _ rixs process at any transition - metal ( tm ) ion @xmath11 edge , the incoming photon excites a core shell 2@xmath2 electron into the 3@xmath6 shell , which consequently decays into an outgoing photon and a charge , spin , or orbital excitation in the electronic system  @xcite . in the case of iron - based superconductors considered in this work",
    ", we have to take into account more than one relevant orbital states of the 3@xmath6 shell .",
    "note that this multi - orbital structure leads to the characteristic disconnected fermi surface sheets dominating the low energy properties in these materials . using the fast collision approximation  @xcite the rixs cross section",
    "can be decomposed into a combination of the charge and the spin dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) of @xmath6 electrons as@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the charge and spin dsf corresponding to the orbital @xmath14 .",
    "note that the spin dsf is assumed to have the same momentum and energy dependence for any direction of the spin  @xcite .",
    "the states @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) denote the initial ( final ) state of rixs process with energy @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the transferred photon energy ( momentum ) . here , the density and the spin of @xmath6 electrons @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined in terms of the orbital operator @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , which creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the orbital @xmath14 with spin @xmath25 and momentum @xmath26 .",
    "the rixs form factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 in [ eq : crosssection ] depend on the tm ion , the orbital symmetry of the system , the specific geometry of the experiment , and on the polarization @xmath29 of the incoming and outgoing x - ray beams  @xcite .",
    "thus , these parameters can be adjusted in the rixs experiment , and therefore , under construction of particular experimental setups , the cross section will be solely determined either by the charge or by the spin dsf . as it has been shown in ref .  , this property can be used to reveal the character of the pairing mechanism in sc materials .",
    "motivated by this idea , we study in this paper the charge and spin dsf for iron - based superconductors using accepted band structure models , and comparing different pairing mechanisms and order parameter symmetries .    the usual way to describe phenomenologically the unconventional sc state in many - particle systems is based on a generalized multi - band mean - field hamiltonian of the form@xcite @xmath30 where the operator @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath25 in the energy band @xmath33 , which is described by the bare electron dispersion @xmath34 , and with @xmath35 the momentum - dependent sc order parameter . the second term in eq .",
    "is responsible for the superconducting state , with the pairing character determined by @xmath36 .",
    "the case of @xmath37 for up and down spin describes the spin - singlet pairing , whereas the case @xmath38 for both spin directions leads to a special type of spin - triplet state . in general , the triplet pairing term is given by @xmath39 , with a multi - component sc order parameter of the form @xmath40\\sigma_y$ ] ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "however , in this paper we consider only the simplest case @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and therefore the gap function simplifies to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    to investigate the rixs cross section given by [ eq : crosssection ] we calculate the dsf @xmath45 on the basis of the model hamiltonian   separately for each of the relevant orbitals . using the unitary transformation @xmath46 between orbital and energy band representation we rewrite the density and spin operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 in [ eq : chargedsf , eq : spindsf ] in terms of the operators @xmath32 and @xmath49 in the band representation .",
    "this step is necessary for the calculation of the matrix elements and excitation energies in [ eq : chargedsf , eq : spindsf ] .",
    "note that , in general , the hamiltonian is not diagonal with respect to the orbital states because the different orbitals can hybridize with each other .",
    "the transformation matrix elements @xmath50 , which describe the orbital content of conduction bands , are obtained diagonalizing the low - energy tight - binding hamiltonian of the system . for this purpose , we consider in this paper the tight - binding model in ref .   for laofeas , and a slightly modified tight - binding model based on ref .   for lifeas ( see below ) .",
    "having expressed the density and spin operators in the dsf in terms of the one - particle operators in the band representation , the next step is to diagonalize the hamiltonian   by a bogoliubov transformation @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 for each of the different bands .",
    "this allows us to find the ground state @xmath55 and the excitations of the system , in terms of the sc quasiparticle ( qp ) operators @xmath56 and of the qp dispersion @xmath57 . in a centrosymmetric sc at zero temperature , the excited states contributing to dsf have the form @xmath58 with energy @xmath59 , and the dsf of qp excitations reads finally @xmath60      , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath61 sign is for the charge ( spin ) dsf  @xcite",
    "this result shows that the momentum - dependent dsf of low energy qp excitations is strongly affected by the orbital content of bare electrons and the structure of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "the character of the sc pairing , which is described by the gap function @xmath35 , arises at energies close to the fermi level @xmath62 .",
    "there , the main contributions to the dsf correspond to excitations close to the fermi surface , i.e. , which fulfill the condition @xmath63 . assuming a phase dependent order parameter in the form @xmath64 , the dsf in [ eq : structurefactor ] for low - energy excitations becomes approximately @xmath65      .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence ,",
    "in addition to the orbital dependence , this quantity is significantly influenced by the order parameter phase @xmath66 on the fermi surface .",
    "in particular , the charge dsf is suppressed for sign reversing ( @xmath67 ) , whereas the spin dsf is suppressed for sign preserving excitations ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "since the rixs form factors @xmath27 and @xmath28 in [ eq : crosssection ] can be tuned by properly choosing the experimental setup , rixs can probe both charge and spin dsf@xcite , which is a unique feature among other spectroscopies .",
    "a comparison of the charge and the spin dsf of qp excitations allow one to disclose not only the orbital symmetry of the ground state , but also the momentum dependence of the magnitude and of the phase of the sc order parameter and , therefore , the underlying symmetry of the pairing mechanism . in the next section",
    "we show numerical results for the two important representatives laofeas and lifeas of the class of iron - based superconductors .",

    "the coherence peak at @xmath73 , corresponds to a nesting between the two hole pockets and between the two electron pockets respectively , which have a different orbital symmetry . for this reason , while clearly visible in ( a ) , the coherence peak is strongly suppressed in ( b ) , where the orbital content of the energy bands is fully taken into account . ]     as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath69 , for the charge and spin dsf of qp excitations in laofeas , with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath74 wave sc order parameter ( @xmath75 , see main text ) , calculated using [ eq : structurefactor ] and assuming the bare electron dispersion and the orbital symmetry of the tight - binding model in ref .  , summing over the contributions of the two orbitals @xmath70 .",
    "the coherence peak at the @xmath76 point is largely dominant in the charge dsf spectra , while spectral intensities at @xmath77 and around the @xmath76 point ( @xmath78 ) are sensitive to the differences in the order parameter phase along the fermi surface .",
    "spectral intensities at @xmath5 are strongly suppressed in the charge ( spin ) spectra in the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) wave state , while intensities for @xmath78 around the @xmath76 point are suppressed in the charge ( spin ) dsf in the @xmath74 ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) wave state . ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we start by considering the effective two - band tight - binding model proposed in ref .  , which is regarded as a minimal model for conduction electrons in iron - based superconductors .",
    "this model contains the effective hoppings between the two orbitals @xmath79 and @xmath71 of the iron ions , within a single fe - ion unit cell , and correctly reproduces the band structure of the compound laofeas , which consists of disconnected hole - like fermi surface sheets around @xmath80 and @xmath73 and separate electron pockets of similar size around @xmath81 and @xmath82 in the brillouin zone [ compare fig .",
    "[ fig : raghu - confront ]  ( c ) ] .",
    "we assume three different symmetries for the superconducting gap , i.e. , @xmath0 wave@xcite , @xmath1 wave@xcite , and a spin - triplet @xmath74 wave@xcite , where the momentum dependence is modeled respectively by @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 , with @xmath75 , where @xmath86 is the magnitude of the dominant near - neighbor hopping ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) . for these choices of the order parameter ,",
    "the gap magnitude in the spin - singlet case varies around @xmath87 along the electron pockets and the inner hole pocket , and around @xmath88 along the outer hole pocket , with opposite sign in the case of the @xmath0 wave symmetry . in the spin - triplet case instead",
    ", the gap magnitude varies around @xmath89 along the electron pockets and the inner hole pocket , and around @xmath90 along the outer hole pocket .    at",
    "first we study the effect of the orbital variation on the spectra . in [ fig : raghu - confront ] is shown the charge dsf , defined in [ eq : chargedsf ] , at a fixed energy loss @xmath91 as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath69 for one particular pairing symmetry .",
    "the calculations are based on [ eq : structurefactor ] using the @xmath0 wave order parameter described above . in [ fig : raghu - confront ]  ( a ) the orbital prefactors @xmath50 in [ eq : structurefactor ] are neglected , leading to a pure band structure model .",
    "in contrast , in [ fig : raghu - confront ]  ( b ) the orbital degrees of freedom have been fully taken into account .",
    "the contributions from the two orbitals @xmath70 have been summed up with equal weight since the momentum distribution of each orbital shows qualitatively similar results .",
    "a comparison of these two panels clearly shows that the orbital content of the electron states modifies strongly the momentum dependence of rixs spectra .",
    "in particular , the intensity peak at @xmath92 in [ fig : raghu - confront ]  ( b ) is strongly suppressed , and this result is not related to the particular choice of the pairing symmetry , as confirmed by calculations based on different order parameters ( not shown ) .",
    "this suppression originates from the fact that such transferred momentum corresponds to a nesting between branches of the fermi surface which have a different orbital symmetry@xcite , i.e. , the two electron pockets around @xmath76 and @xmath73 and the two hole pockets around @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively , as shown in [ fig : raghu - confront ]  ( c ) .",
    "thence , orbital degrees of freedom can not be neglected when considering qp spectra in iron - based sc .",
    "furthermore , to highlight the sensitivity of dsf spectra to the order parameter phase , we show in [ fig : raghu ] the charge and spin dsf at a fixed energy loss @xmath91 as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath69 , for the three choices of the order parameter defined above .",
    "as one can see , low energy excitations which are sign reversing , ( opposite phase of the order parameter ) , suppress the charge component of the dsf , whereas sign preserving excitations ( same phase of the order parameter ) suppress the spin component in the low energy qp spectra .",
    "for this reason , spectral intensities at @xmath77 in [ fig : raghu ] are suppressed in the charge and in the spin dsf respectively in @xmath0 wave and in the @xmath1 wave sc states .",
    "such transferred momentum corresponds to the ordering vector of the antiferromagnetic phase , and is in fact a nesting vector between the hole pockets and the electron pockets in the brillouin zone , which have an opposite sign or the same sign of the order parameter alternatively in the @xmath0 wave and in the @xmath1 wave states .",
    "the signature of the @xmath2 wave odd symmetry has to be found instead in the spectral intensities of excitations with transferred momentum @xmath78 ( see [ fig : raghu ] ) , corresponding to a `` self - nesting '' of the hole pockets .",
    "this type of excitations , which lead to characteristic intensity features also in lifeas ( see next subsection ) , refer to _ intraband _ contributions located in a narrow momentum range similar to the conventional nesting scenario between the electron and hole pockets . in the @xmath4 wave case",
    "these excitations preserve the sign of the order parameter ( @xmath95 ) , leading to a suppression of spectral intensities in the spin dsf . in the @xmath2 wave case instead ,",
    "these excitations are sign reversing ( @xmath96 ) , with a consequent suppression in the charge dsf .      ) fitted with the experimental fermi surface of lifeas@xcite ( solid line ) . ]",
    "while there is a general agreement about the presence of a spin - singlet @xmath0 wave superconductivity@xcite in other iron - based sc , where nesting dominates the low energy properties , the nature of the sc state in lifeas seems to be elusive .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed in place of the @xmath0 wave pairing , e.g. , an @xmath1 wave sc state , driven by the critical @xmath6-orbital fluctuations induced by moderate electron - phonon interactions@xcite , or even a spin - triplet pairing driven by ferromagnetic fluctuations@xcite . while the singlet pairing is supported by some neutron scattering experiments@xcite , the unusual shape of the fermi surface and the momentum dependency of the sc gap measured by arpes@xcite is in conflict with the @xmath0 wave symmetry . moreover , stm experiments of the qp interference@xcite are consistent with a @xmath2 wave spin - triplet state or with a singlet pairing mechanism with a more complex order parameter ( @xmath97 wave ) .",
    "whereas arpes has been proven to be powerful in measuring the momentum dependence of the sc gap on the fermi surface@xcite , it should be noted here that arpes , since not sensitive to the order parameter phase , can not distinguish between singlet and triplet pairing , i.e. , between even ( @xmath98 ) and odd ( @xmath99 ) symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "in fact , the experimental momentum dependence of the superconducting gap measured by arpes@xcite is consistent , in principle , with a spin - singlet as well as with a spin - triplet state , as long as the pairing mechanism correctly reproduces the gap magnitude variations along the fermi surface .",
    "the theoretical predictions shown in this subsection in combination with an appropriate rixs experiment might help to clarify this complicated and controversial situation in lifeas . to achieve this goal",
    ", we consider different order parameter symmetries , corresponding to spin - singlet and spin - triplet pairing . in order to properly take into account the orbital degrees of freedom of the system ,",
    "we construct our model on the basis of the effective three - band tight - binding model proposed in ref .  , which includes the effective hoppings between the @xmath100 orbitals of the iron ions , within a single fe - ion unit cell .",
    "nevertheless , a comparison with arpes measurements@xcite shows that the inner hole pocket in lifeas is much smaller than the one produced by the tight - binding model in ref .  .",
    "furthermore , the sc gap is significantly larger@xcite on the inner hole pocket than on the outer one . for this reason ,",
    "we redefine the hopping parameters in order to fit the experimental fermi surface@xcite .",
    "these parameters are given in [ tab : tb ] , while in [ fig : bands ] we compare the fitted fermi surface ( a ) and bare electron dispersion ( b ) with the original model ( cf .",
    "ref .  ) .    besides the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath74 wave defined above",
    ", we consider here also a triplet pairing order parameter @xmath101 , defined as @xmath102 , i.e. , having the same magnitude of the @xmath103 ( or @xmath1 ) wave and the same phase @xmath104 of the @xmath74 wave order parameter .",
    "this sc order parameter is considered here for comparison , in order to have an example of a spin - triplet pairing which reproduces the experimental gap magnitude on the different branches of the fermi surface in lifeas .",
    "moreover , the equal gap structure in comparison to the singlet pairing models allows us to study those features of spectra which are solely attributed to the phase variation .",
    "we fix the order parameter magnitude by taking @xmath105 , in order to be consistent with the measured value of the sc gap in lifeas@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of the @xmath4 wave states ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and of the @xmath101 wave state , the gap magnitude varies around @xmath106 along the electron pockets , around @xmath107 along the inner hole pocket , and around @xmath108 along the outer hole pocket , with opposite sign in the case of the @xmath0 wave symmetry , and with the phase continuously varying on the fermi surface in the case of the @xmath101 wave state . in the @xmath74 wave case instead , the gap magnitude varies around @xmath109 along the electron pockets , around @xmath110 along the inner hole pocket , and around @xmath111 along the outer hole pocket . in any of the case",
    "considered , the low energy qp excitations contribute to coherence peaks at the @xmath76 point with energy in the range @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) .        in [ fig : lifeas ]",
    "are shown the rixs intensities for the charge and spin dsf at a fixed energy loss @xmath114 as a function of the transferred momentum @xmath69 , for different choices of the sc order parameter symmetry , calculated using [ eq : structurefactor ] . in lifeas",
    ", no nesting occurs between the hole and the electron pockets@xcite , and therefore the peak at @xmath5 in the qp spectra , which corresponds to the scattering between hole and electron pockets , is much weaker and broader than in the laofeas case .",
    "the intensive square - like intensity distribution around the center of the brillouin zone obtained for all assumed types of pairing is a typical feature of the low energy spectrum in lifeas arising from interband scattering processes between the two hole - like fermi surface sheets@xcite .",
    "indeed , as in the previous case , rixs spectra in lifeas are strongly sensitive to the symmetry of the sc order parameter and on its relative phase differences along the fermi surface .",
    "in fact , spectral intensities at @xmath5 are further suppressed in the charge and in the spin dsf respectively in the @xmath0 wave and in the @xmath1 wave sc states .",
    "this is because @xmath115 , with the @xmath61 sign corresponding to the @xmath1 and @xmath0 wave , resulting in sign preserving and sign reversing excitations respectively . in the @xmath2 wave states",
    "no suppression occur , being @xmath116 , i.e. , with a phase difference given by @xmath117 , resulting in charge and spin coherence factors [ see [ eq : coherencefactors ] ] which continuously vary on the fermi surface . again , the signature of the @xmath2 wave odd symmetry is in the spectral intensities of excitations with transferred momentum @xmath78 around the @xmath76 point , corresponding to a self - nesting of the larger hole pocket ( see [ fig : lifeas ] ) . while in the @xmath4 wave case excitations at @xmath118 are sign preserving , with a consequent suppression of spectral intensities in the spin dsf , in the @xmath2 wave case they are sign reversing , resulting instead in an enhancement in the spin dsf .    in order to present in the most clear way how to distinguish between the different pairing scenarios in lifeas , we show in [ fig : lifeas - hsp ] the rixs spectra as a function of the energy loss for the charge and spin dsf of qp excitations at @xmath5 and at @xmath118 , again for different choices of the sc order parameter symmetry . as we have seen , these particular momenta are those where the sensitivity to the order parameter phase is more pronounced . in particular ,",
    "spectral intensities corresponding to the transferred momentum @xmath5 are sensitive to sign changes of the order parameter between hole and electron pockets . indeed , as one can see in [ fig :",
    "lifeas - hsp ] , the charge ( spin ) dsf is suppressed in the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) wave state .",
    "therefore , a comparison between spin and charge dsf can be revealing of a sign reversal in the order parameter between disconnected branches of the fermi surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral contributions of the intraband scattering within the hole pockets , which correspond to a transferred momentum @xmath78 , are strongly affected by the parity of the order parameter , and therefore can discriminate between spin - singlet ( e.g. , @xmath4 wave ) and spin - triplet pairing ( e.g. , @xmath2 wave ) . in fact , spectral intensities at @xmath118 in [ fig : lifeas - hsp ] are suppressed in the spin and charge dsf respectively in the spin - singlet ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave ) and in the spin - triplet ( @xmath74 and @xmath101 wave ) cases .",
    "it should be noticed here that this result is general , and does not depend on the gap magnitude dependence along the fermi surface , but only on its phase variations , and therefore is a mere consequence of the odd parity of the order parameter .",
    "this aspect is clearly displayed by the two panels of [ fig : lifeas - hsp ] referring to the @xmath2 wave state at @xmath118 .",

    "<S> we develop a phenomenological theory to predict the characteristic features of the momentum - dependent scattering amplitude in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) for the case of the iron - based superconductors . taking into account all relevant orbital states as well as their specific content along the fermi surface </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate for the compounds laofeas and lifeas the dynamical structure factors of charge and spin based on tight - binding models , which are fully consistent with recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data . </S>",
    "<S> while the orbital content strongly modifies the momentum dependence of rixs intensities , we find considerable enhancement of the intensity of sign reversing excitations in the spin structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a characteristic intensity redistribution between spin and charge transfer excitations is found in case of antisymmetric momentum dependence of the superconducting order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our results show that rixs spectra can discriminate between @xmath0 and @xmath1 wave gap functions in the singlet pairing case . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a possible triplet pairing based on chiral @xmath2 wave gap function affects the intensity at small momenta and can be distinguished from singlet pairing . </S>"
