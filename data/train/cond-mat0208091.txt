    "spin - polarized transport through magnetic multilayers is the physical origin of many exciting phenomena such as giant magnetoresistance and spin  current - induced magnetization reversal.@xcite it has attracted attention in the basic physics community and industry over the last decades , but there are still open fundamental questions .",
    "so far , the main research activity has been focused on the dc transport properties of these systems .",
    "ac magnetotransport has attracted considerably less attention than its dc counterpart . in a recent paper,@xcite",
    "we reported a novel mechanism by which a precessing ferromagnet pumps  a spin current into adjacent nonmagnetic conductors proportional to the precession frequency , using a formalism analogous to that for the adiabatic pumping of charges in mesoscopic systems.@xcite we showed that spin pumping profoundly affects the dynamics of nanoscale ferromagnets and thin films , by renormalizing fundamental parameters such as the gyromagnetic ratio and gilbert damping parameter , in agreement with experiments.@xcite    the switching characteristics of a magnetic system depends in an essential way on the gilbert damping constant @xmath0 . in magnetic field - induced switching processes , for example , @xmath0 governs the technologically important magnetization reversal time of ferromagnetic particles .",
    "its typical intrinsic value@xcite @xmath1 for transition metal ferromagnets is smaller than its optimal value of @xmath2 for the fastest switching rates.@xcite the present mechanism allows engineering of the damping constant by adding passive nonmagnetic components to the system and/or adjusting the geometry to control spin flow and relaxation rates described in this paper , thus helping to create high - speed magnetoelectronic devices .",
    "also , in spin  current - induced magnetization reversal , the critical switching current is proportional to @xmath0.@xcite    for some time it has been understood that a ferromagnet  normal - metal ( _ f - n _ ) interface leads to a dynamical coupling between the ferromagnetic magnetization and the spins of the conduction - band electrons in the normal metal.@xcite more recently , several theoretical frameworks were put forward proposing a mechanism for magnetization damping due to _ f - n _ interfacial processes.@xcite this _ f - n _ coupling becomes important in the limit of ultrathin ( @xmath310  nm ) ferromagnetic films and can lead to a sizable enhancement of the damping constant .",
    "our theory is based on a new physical picture , according to which the ferromagnetic damping can be understood as an adiabatic pumping of spins into the adjacent normal metals.@xcite this spin transfer is governed by the reflection and transmission matrices of the system , analogous to the scattering theory of transport and interlayer exchange coupling . the microscopic expression for the enhanced gilbert damping and",
    "the renormalized gyromagnetic ratio can be calculated by simple models or by first - principles band - structure calculations without adjustable parameters .",
    "the present theory therefore allows quantitative predictions for the magnetization damping in hybrid systems that can be tested by experiments .",
    "the gilbert damping constant in thin ferromagnetic films has been experimentally studied@xcite by measuring ferromagnetic - resonance ( fmr ) linewidths . in the regime of ultrathin ferromagnetic films , @xmath0 was in some cases found to be quite large in comparison with the bulk value @xmath4 , and sensitively depending on the substrate and capping layer materials .",
    "for example , when a 20- - thick permalloy ( py ) film was sandwiched between two pt layers , its damping was found to be @xmath5 , but recovered its bulk value @xmath6 with a cu buffer and cap.@xcite heinrich _ et al . _ @xcite observed an enhanced damping of @xmath720   - thick fe films when they were grown on ag bulk substrates but no significant change in the damping constant was seen for films grown on gaas even when the film thickness was reduced down to several atomic monolayers.@xcite we will demonstrate here that our theory explains all these experimental findings well .",
    "previously , we studied the situation when the normal - metal layers adjacent to the ferromagnetic films are perfect spin sinks , so that the spin accumulation in the normal metal vanishes.@xcite here this theory is generalized to consider the spin accumulation which enables us to explain experimental findings for various _ f - n _ systems@xcite in a unified framework based on the spin - pumping picture .",

    "it is important to stress that while the profiles of the trends displayed in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] reveal the diffusive nature of spin transfer in the cu spacer , they can not be used to judge the validity of a detailed mechanism for spin injection ( relaxation ) at the py - cu ( cu - pt ) interface .",
    "the case of our spin pumping picture is strongly supported by the normalization of the curves ( in agreement with experiment ) , which are governed in our theory by quantities known from other sources .    the trends in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] can be understood as follows .",
    "since cu is a poor spin sink , a py - cu contact with a single cu film does not lead to a significant damping enhancement .",
    "the small spin - flip ratio , @xmath208 , causes most of the spins transferred into the normal - metal layer to be scattered back and relax in the ferromagnet before flipping their direction in the cu buffer .",
    "this leads only to a small damping enhancement , which saturates at @xmath209 and vanishes in the limit @xmath210 .",
    "the situation changes after a pt film , a very good spin sink , is connected to the bilayer : if the normal - metal layer is smaller than the elastic mean free path , @xmath211 , the spin accumulation is uniform throughout the cu buffer .",
    "the spin pumping will now be partitioned .",
    "a fraction of the pumped spins reflects back into the ferromagnet , while the rest get transmitted and subsequently relax in the pt layer .",
    "the ratio between these two fractions equals the ratio between the conductance of the py - cu contact and the co - pt contact , @xmath212 , and is of the order of unity .",
    "this results in a large magnetization damping as a significant portion of the spin pumping relaxes by spin - orbit scattering in pt .",
    "when @xmath75 is increased , less spins manage to diffuse through the entire cu buffer , and , in the limit @xmath209 , the majority of the spins scatter back into the ferromagnet or relax in cu not feeling the presence of the pt layer at all . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the spin pumping into the pt layer has an algebraic fall - off on the scale of the elastic mean free path and exponential one on the scale of the spin - diffusion length .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the strong dependence of damping on the cu layer thickness @xmath75 in the py - cu - pt configuration gives evidence of the spin accumulation in the normal - metal system .",
    "this spin accumulation , in turn , indicates that an excited ferromagnet ( as in the fmr experiment discussed here ) transfers spins into adjacent nonmagnetic layers , confirming our claim.@xcite furthermore , this supports our concept of the spin battery.@xcite    before ending this section , it is illuminating to make a small digression and further study eq .",
