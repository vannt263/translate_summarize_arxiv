    "the @xmath4cdm model is a highly successful paradigm at large scales @xcite , but it shows some drawbacks at smaller scales ( galactic , and centre of galaxy clusters scales @xcite).cdm paradigm suffers of other problems even at cosmological scales ( e.g. , the cosmological constant problem @xcite , and the `` cosmic coincidence problem '' ) . ]    of the main problems of the @xmath4cdm paradigm the most `` stubborn '' seems to be the so called cusp / core problem @xcitecdm paradigm , are a ) the discrepancy between the number of subhaloes that n - body simulations predict ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and observations ; b ) the too - big - to - fail ( tbtf ) problem . in this last problem",
    "simulated haloes have too many , too dense and massive subhalos in comparison to observations @xcite .",
    "unified solutions have been proposed to the quoted problems , based on the action of baryons located in the inner parts of the haloes @xcite . ] dealing with a discrepancy between the flat density profiles observed in lsbs and dwarf galaxies , and the cuspy density profile obtained in n - body simulations , e.g. the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile @xcite .",
    "the nfw profile predicts an inner profile going as @xmath5 , with @xmath6 .",
    "an even steeper profile predicted by @xcite and @xcite gives @xmath5 , with @xmath7 , while other authors found that the inner slope is dependent on the object considered , and/or its mass @xcite .",
    "more recent n - body dissipationless simulations seem to agree on the fact that a profile flattening towards the centre , to a minimum value of @xmath8 @xcite , namely the einasto profile , seems to be a better fit to simulations @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the smallest value predicted by dissipationless n - body simulations is larger than the values obtained by observations @xcite , in sph simulations @xcite , or in semi - analytical models @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite found that haloes do not show universal density profiles , rather their shape is determined by the initial linear power spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "in addition , the authors found that profiles depend on the halo mass , in agreement with previous works on the subject and that warm dark matter ( wdm ) halos develop a core , but this is not significant enough to explain observations .",
    "the cusp / core problem has been also noticed at galaxy clusters scales .",
    "kinematics and lensing constraints in cd galaxies ( bcg ) located in the centre of relaxed clusters , showed that the clusters dm profiles is flatter than a nfw profile , but the total mass profile is in agreement with the nfw predictions @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies are dark matter ( dm ) dominated , and have a low baryon fraction @xcite .",
    "they have been widely used because of their simple dynamical structure , at least disk galaxies without bulges . in the case of high - surface brightness objects ( larger objects ) , it is more complicated to determine the inner density structure .",
    "so , the previous statement on the cored nature of the inner density profile of all galaxies , is not at all obvious .",
    "while according to @xcite high - surface brightness galaxies are cored , other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) conclude differently .",
    "the things sample shows a tendency to have profiles better described by isothermal ( iso ) profiles for low luminosity galaxies , @xmath9 and the profiles are equally well described by cuspy or cored profiles for @xmath10 . however , even dwarfs do not always have flat slopes , as shown by @xcite . in the case of ngc 2976 , 4605 , 5949 , 5693 , 6689 , the authors showed that the profiles range from 0 ( ngc2976 ) to -1.28 ( ngc5963 ) .",
    "different results have been obtained even using similar techniques for the same object .",
    "for example , in the case of ngc2976 the dark matter profile slope is bracketed by @xmath11 , according to @xcite , while @xmath12 for @xcite , @xmath13 according to @xcite , considering stars as tracers , or @xmath14 @xcite , considering gas as tracer .",
    "the previous discussion highlights the fact that the determination of the inner slope of galaxies , even dwarves , is not at all an easy task .",
    "the result from the previous studies and several others is that exists a range of profiles , and even with the improvements of nowadays kinematic maps there is no agreement on the exact dark matter slopes distribution @xcite .",
    "the situation is even more clear going to larger masses ( e.g. , spiral galaxies ) dominated by stars for a wider discussion . ] , and especially to smaller masses ( e.g. dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) ) where biases that enter in the system modelling @xcite lead to opposite results .",
    "several techniques have been used .",
    "the spherical jeans equation gives results highly dependent on the assumptions , since mass and anisotropy of the stellar orbits are degenerate in the quoted model @xcite .",
    "maximum likelihood in parameter space in jeans modelling @xcite has similar problems .",
    "schwarzschild modelling has been used for ( e.g. ) sculptor and fornax finding cored profiles @xcite .",
    "methods based on multiple stellar populations concluded that fornax ( slope measured at @xmath15 1 kpc ) and sculptor ( slope measured at @xmath15 500 pc ) have a cored profile @xcite .",
    "however , a cusp is found in draco using a schwarzschild model @xcite .",
    "the previous results show that in reality there is no accepted conclusion on the inner structures of dsphs .    on the other side ,",
    "a clear determination of the cored or cuspy structure of dsphs is very important because the smaller is the mass of an object the more probable is that its inner profile is similar to that of dissipationless n - body simulations predictions , namely cuspy .",
    "concerning how the cusp / core problem could be solved , there are at least two different approaches : + a ) cosmological solutions , based on a different spectrum at small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , different nature of the dark matter particles @xcite , or modified gravity theories , e.g. , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mond @xcite .",
    "+ b ) astrophysical solutions .",
    "these are based on the idea that the dark matter component of a galaxy expands due to a `` heating '' mechanism with the result that the inner density is reduced .",
    "the two most known astrophysical solutions are a ) `` supernovae feedback flattening '' ( snff ) of the cusp @xcite , + and + b ) `` dynamical friction from baryonic clumps '' ( dfbc ) @xcite .    a wider discussion of the two models is given in sections  [ sect : sff ] and  [ sect : gcm ] .",
    "here , we may recall that the snff model in the @xcite results has been found in agreement with the things galaxies @xcite density profiles @xcite . results somehow contradicting the previous ones are those of ( e.g. ) @xcite who simulated feedback from supernovae ( sn ) and radiation pressure from massive stars , both in disk galaxies and dwarfs .",
    "they found that the second effect is more important than supernovae feedback .",
    "the ability of the model to solve the small scale problems of the @xmath4cdm model has also been questioned by several authors @xcite ( see section  [ sect : sff ] ) .",
    "the dfbc predicted the correct shape of galaxy density profiles @xcite in agreement with the sph simulations performed by @xcite and of clusters @xcite by @xcite and as well predicted correlations among several quantities observed in clusters of galaxies @xcite , later observed in @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the inner slope depends on the ratio @xmath18 in the snff scheme .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the model is performed in section  [ sect : sff ] .",
    "it predicts a dependence of the inner slope from the ratio @xmath18 .",
    "the profile goes from a cuspy one for low values of the quoted ratio to cored ones and again to a cuspy one for large spiral galaxies .",
    "we want to recall that in the dfbc scheme it was found a correlation among the inner slope , the halo mass and the angular momentum of the structure @xcite , in the case of dwarf galaxies , normal spirals , and clusters . in clusters ,",
    "a series of other correlation were found @xcite , namely a ) a correlation among the inner slope and baryonic content to halo mass ratio at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and at @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( see * ? ? ? * their figures 2 , 4 ) is the mass in @xmath23 , the radius enclosing a density 500 times larger than the critical one ] , and angular momentum .",
    "we recall that the baryonic mass @xmath24 is the initial gas content of the protostructure , while @xmath25 is the final baryonic content , namely @xmath26 .",
    "another confirmation of the goodness of the dfbc is that the inner slope dependence on the ratio @xmath18 is similar to sph simulations results , although in the case of clusters and for a different mechanism than that of sph simulations .",
    "b ) in the cluster case , a further correlation between the inner slope and the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) mass , the core radius @xmath27 and the effective radius @xmath28 , and another correlation between the mass inside 100 kpc , which is mainly dark matter , and that inside 5 kpc , mainly constituted by baryons @xcite was found ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , it was shown that the dfbc mechanism is able to explain the flattening in dwarves as well in clusters @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we want to compare the predictions of the snff mechanism with the dfbc .",
    "to this aim , we will use the results of @xcite , and compare those results with the observations of @xcite , things galaxies , and dwarves , little things , sculptor , fornax , and the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : modeldata ] we describe the data used and the models that we compare to the data .",
    "sections  [ sect : results ] and  [ sect : conclusions ] are devoted to results and conclusions , respectively .",
    "finally in the appendix [ sect : app ] we discuss in detail the dfbc mechanism .",
    "in the present paper , we will try to discern among the two previously quoted astrophysical mechanisms that are able to give rise to cored galaxies .",
    "conscious of the limitations in the determination of the inner slope of the density profile @xmath0 , we will use the best data nowadays available .",

    "the effectiveness of the process has been confirmed by several authors @xcite .",
    "more in detail , as shown in @xcite , initially the proto - structure is in the linear phase , containing dm and diffuse gas .",
    "the proto - structure expands to a maximum radius and then re - collapses , first in the dm component that forms the potential well in which baryons will fall .",
    "baryons subject to radiative processes form clumps , which collapse to the centre of the halo while forming stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see sect .  2.2.2 ,  2.2.3 ) ) .",
    "in the collapse phase baryons are compressed ( adiabatic contraction @xcite ) , so making more cuspy the dm profile .",
    "the clumps collapse to the galactic centre , because of dynamical friction ( df ) between baryons and dm , transferring energy and angular momentum to the dm component .",
    "the cusp is heated , and a core forms , before stars form and stellar feedback starts to act expelling a large part of the gas , leaving a lower stellar density with respect to the beginning .",
    "feedback destroys clumps soon after a small part of their mass is transformed into stars . the mass distribution is then dominated by dm .",
    "the model described is in agreement with @xcite . + it is the only model able to explain the correct dependence of the inner slope of the dm profile over 6 order of magnitudes in the halo mass , namely from dwarves to clusters @xcite . here",
    "we want to stress another interesting point .",
    "as previously reported the model showed that the inner slope is mass dependent @xcite . moreover in @xcite and @xcite were found correlations among the inner slope and other quantities with the bcg mass and radius , in agreement with results by @xcite .",
    "as already described , the snff model is based on the expulsion of gas due to sn explosions , while the dfbc model is based on dynamical friction between baryons and dm .",
    "the two models work in a different way . in the case of the snff model",
    "we start from gas which forms stars which can then explode into sn if they posses the correct mass .",
    "so , in this model in order to produce the density profile flattening , we need a longer and more complex series of events to reach the goal ( cusps transformed into cores ) . in the case of the dfbc ,",
    "it is enough that big gas clumps are present to flatten the density profile . in a few words ,",
    "the dfbc model is more ergonomic than the snff model .        in the last years",
    ", it has been shown that the snff model has some drawbacks .",
    "@xcite calculated the energy that sn must inject into the haloes in order to remove the cusp . according to @xcite , in order to transform a cuspy profile into a cored one in mw dsphs , an energy in the range @xmath231 erg is required .",
    "the average energy released in a snii explosion is of the order of @xmath219 erg @xcite .",
    "so the explosions of hundreds to several thousands of sns could in principle produce this huge amount of energy .",
    "however , the low star formation efficiency in dsphs , suggested by their luminous satellites abundance , implies that the real contribution to the energy could be lower than that needed to flatten a profile .",
    "moreover , while the solution to the cusp / core problem with the snff model needs a large number of sns , and so a large star formation efficiency ( sfe ) , the solution of another small scale problem of the @xmath4cdm model , namely the tbtf problem , places an opposite demand on the sfe . in order to eliminate such a tension one or more of the following issues",
    "should be true : a ) a coupling of energy coming from sn ii to dm of the order of 1 .",
    "such a value of the `` energy coupling '' ( @xmath232 ) contradicts observations . in order to describe the metallicity - luminosity relation in dsphs , @xcite obtained a value of @xmath233 , while the value of @xmath232 used in @xcite is 0.40 . even this large value is smaller than what needed to eliminate the quoted tension .",
    "b ) cusp removal at high redshifts ( @xmath234 from the sculptor and fornax cored profiles ) .",
    "namely , star formation should peak at redshifts unexpectedly high ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "this conclusion is at odds with the fact that star formation went on for 12 - 13 gyr in fornax @xcite , and for 6 - 7 gyr in sculptor @xcite .",
    "even if the star formation peak was at that redshift , the tension moves to haloes embedding less stars , the formation of cores in dsphs with @xmath235 requires @xmath236 .",
    "c ) a top - heavy stellar initial mass function .",
    "d ) considerable satellite disruption ( e.g. , by tidal torques ) .",
    "this last issue is promising in the solution of the previously discussed problem as shown by @xcite .",
    "however , we should add that @xcite had to use a very high star formation threshold to obtain their results .",
    "@xcite showed that the high threshold assumption is not necessary to obtain the results claimed by @xcite .",
    "one additional argument of discussion about simulations and the tbtf problem is given by @xcite .",
    "the authors could largely reconcile the discrepancy between simulations and observations by using the latest cosmological parameters provided by the wmap and planck team .",
    "they concluded therefore that the strong tension observed in previous works on the subject was mainly due to the incorrect assumption of the cosmological parameters .",
    "another source of tension comes from the assumed mass of the milky way : assuming its most recent estimates , the need of baryonic physics necessary to decrease the density of the most massive satellites in the milky way becomes much less compelling . despite this improvement",
    ", one more aspect lacks a satisfactory explanation , namely the problem of missing bright satellites just outside the milky way virial radius , as discussed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    on a similar line ,",
    "@xcite discuss general problems of the snff model and in particular problems in solving the tbtf problem .",
    "comparing the effects of blow - outs of different masses ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath230 ) they found that a single blow - out of a fixed mass has more effect in changing the structure of a dwarf in comparison with several repeated blow - outs whose mass sums to the that of the single blow - out , contrarily to the snff model which requires repeated blow - outs ( see * ? ? ?",

    "from the point of view of the mass , for the high resolution simulations of @xcite to have subhaloes density in line with that observed in mw dsphs , a quantity of mass equal to @xmath230 should be ejected , which is marginally exceeding the baryon content of the dsphs . from the energy point of view , since the average energy emitted by sns explosions is @xmath219 erg , to match the density of a @xmath239 dsph , the energy of 40000 supernovae is needed with an efficiency of 100% . for six of the nine classical dsphs ,",
    "this quantity exceeded the number of type ii sn explosions expected .",
    "moreover , they find that explosions can flatten the inner slope to @xmath240 , never producing a real core with constant density , as predicted by the last versions of the snff model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite arrived to similar conclusions , namely the high improbability for the snff to solve the tbtf problem .",
    "finally , as several authors noticed @xcite , nowadays hydrodynamical simulations have not the required resolution to follow the feedback processes which should transform the cusp into a core .",
    "finally @xcite and @xcite with the use of hydrodynamical simulations investigate the ` cusp versus core ' problem and conclude that this is better characterized as an ` inner mass deficit ' problem rather than as a density slope mismatch .",
    "investigating simulated dwarf galaxies and comparing their properties with a selected catalogue of observed galaxies , they find several discrepancies .",
    "the authors conclude that to solve these discrepancies , it is necessary either to change the dark matter physics , that the mass profiles of the galaxies giving rise to the ` cusp versus core ' problem are incorrect when inferred from kinematic data or that simulations fail to reproduce correctly observations , as pointed by other authors before .    concerning the dfbc model , to our knowledge there are not studies on its limits .",
    "however , since the effectiveness of this process depends on the clumps properties and that of the halo , one could speculate about the a ) the origin of the clumps , and b ) the time - scales for the density flattening in comparison with the life of the clumps .    concerning the first issue , some galaxies ( `` clump clusters '' and `` chain galaxies '' ) at high redshift show clumpy structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in order for the mechanism to work , the gas clumps should live for a time longer than that needed to redistribute dm in the halo centre .",

    "after star formation starts , if the clumps are destroyed by supernovae , we have to wait another @xmath248 yr before the first star explodes .    for precision s sake , @xcite observed outflows coming out from the stellar clumps parts of the clump clusters , and @xcite suggested that the clumps dissipate in a few tens of myrs @xcite , to 100 times this value in high - z clumps ( compatible with the redshift of flattening ) .",

    "the ability of the dfbc mechanism to form profiles flatter than the snff mechanism is important since it implies that dsphs of low mass are not necessarily cuspy , as predicted by the snff model .",
    "this means that the observation of cored profiles at small stellar masses ( e.g. , @xmath3 ) would not imply that the @xmath4cdm model has scarce possibilities to be correct , as it is predicted by the snff model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we applied a @xmath280 to the data and model ( see the following subsection ) .    since data having not sufficient spatial resolution can give rise to larger values of @xmath0 , in cored systems , it is useful to study the behaviour of the logarithmic slope in terms of the data spatial resolution . in figure",

    "the difference among the things dwarves and the @xcite result could be due to the fact that the things dwarves have smaller stellar masses .",

    "@xcite measured the inner slopes by using a power - law fit to the innermost @xmath288 points of the rotation curve ( @xmath289 kpc ) .",

    "we use @xcite data for the things galaxies , _ for compatibility reasons _ , since we also used oh s data for things dwarves and little things .",
    "the reason behind it is that it is important to use galaxies whose slope is determined in a similar way and approximately at the same distance from the centre .",
    "hence our choice for using data from @xcite and @xcite and neglecting those from @xcite .",

    "as expected the values are either very small or very big , due to the fact that the @xmath280 is significantly different from one .",
    "this is one more confirmation that the models fit the current data very poorly , also for the optimal sample , despite a significant improvement in terms of probability with respect to the full sample .",
    "lccc sample & @xmath226 & @xmath227 + all ( gas ) & @xmath307 & @xmath308 + all ( stars ) & @xmath309 & @xmath310 + optimal ( gas ) & @xmath311 & @xmath312 + optimal ( stars ) & @xmath313 & @xmath314 + @xmath291  km / s ( gas ) & @xmath315 & @xmath316 + @xmath291  km / s ( stars ) & @xmath317 & @xmath318 + @xmath292  km / s & @xmath319 & @xmath320 +    we can therefore conclude that while in general the two different models studied in this work perform similarly , when we restrict to a subsample of data , the model of this paper based on dynamical friction performs better than the model based on sn feedback even if not at an appreciable statistically significant level .",
    "the aim of this work is to compare the predictions of two models thought to be able to solve the cusp / core problem @xcite .",
    "the models taken into account are the ones based on the sn feedback ( see sect .",
    "[ sect : sff ] ) and on the baryon clumps ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : gcm ] ) .",
    "the first one assumes as main driver of the flattening the internal density profile , the action of the sn explosions on the surrounding medium causing the expulsion of gas , while the second one is based on the idea that energy and angular momentum transfer from baryon clumps to the dark matter component can flatten the profile and transform a cusp into a core .",
    "we compare the models with a sample of observational data built from different sets ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : data ] for a detailed description ) . here",
    "we limit ourselves to a short description .",
    "one of the catalogues adopted is based on the sample of seven nearby galaxies by @xcite using both gas and stars as tracers , together with three additional objects studied by @xcite .",
    "a second data set is based on seven things dwarves studied by @xcite and a third sample is based on the twenty - one objects of the little things set , kindly provided by se - heon oh @xcite . a fourth set , also provided by se - heon oh @xcite includes the things spirals and finally , the last set is built with data for the milky way , fornax and sculptor galaxies .",
    "analysing figures  [ fig : alphamstar ] and  [ fig : alphamstaropt ] ( the first with the full set of data points , the second with a restricted subsample made of the @xcite and @xcite galaxies , and the two things dwarves ho ii and ddo 154 ) and comparing the models with a reduced chi - square @xmath302 analysis , we see that the whole data set does not favour any of the two models in particular , while a restricted analysis to the mentioned higher quality subsample shows a clear preference for the model based on baryon clumps .",
    "we also showed that dsphs of small mass ( @xmath321 ) can have cored profiles . for @xmath322 the slope is @xmath323 .",
    "this is the main difference between the snff model and the dfbc of this paper .",
    "an important consequence is that finding a dsphs having @xmath321 with an inner profile not cuspy , as predicted by the snff model , is not death hit for the @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the last point clearly shows that the determination of the inner structure of dwarf galaxies is of fundamental importance to determine the nature of the dm .",
    "however , as already reported the inner structure of dm haloes of dsphs is still debated , since it is difficult to distinguish cuspy and cored profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "can this problem been solved in the near future ? some authors hinted to this possibility .",
    "future observations from the subaru hyper - supreme - camera @xcite or gaia @xcite have been indicated as a possible way out from the puzzle . in reality ,",
    "even with those observations the problem will not be solved except for some larger dwarf galaxies ( e.g. sagittarius , see * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , as previously discussed , one method often used to study the density profiles is based on the jeans equations .",
    "the method has a drawback , a degeneracy between the density profile and the anisotropy parameter @xmath324 .",
    "the direct determination of this parameter is not possible having just data on the 2d projection of stars radius and from the line of sight component of stars velocity .",
    "several improvements to the previous case have been proposed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "better results could be obtained by means of the 2 + 1 data sets ( meaning that we know two of the three position coordinates and one of the three velocity coordinates ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "information on the proper motions allows the determination of the density slope at half - light radius @xcite .",
    "however , the proper motions of dwarf galaxy stars is challenging to determine even with gaia @xcite , with a maximum astrometric accuracy of 7 @xmath119as at magnitude @xmath325 , while it could have been possible with an error of @xmath326 , determining the proper motions of just 200 stars , with the sim mission , which should have had a higher astrometric accuracy than gaia s @xcite .",
    "the authors thank joshua simon and arianna di cintio for useful discussions and se - heon oh for kindly providing his data points .",
    "the model used in the present paper was introduced in @xcite , and then applied in several other papers to study the universality of the density profiles @xcite , the density profiles in galaxies @xcite and clusters @xcite , and the inner surface - density of galaxies @xcite .",
