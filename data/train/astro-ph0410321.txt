    "the physical properties of galaxy nuclei are of larger interest in light of growing indications that evolution in the central few parsecs is linked to the global properties of the surrounding galaxy .",
    "this connection is evident particularly in correlations between the mass of a central black hole , and bulge mass ( e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ; hring & rix 2004 ) or velocity dispersion ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) .",
    "star formation in the centers of galaxies is also known to take on unusual forms that may be in symbiosis with a central mass concentration , or the larger structure of the galaxy ( i.e. , bulge or bar ) .",
    "a rich phenomenology is seen in the central few parsecs of galaxy nuclei within the local group , but our knowledge of nuclei at greater distances is limited by a corresponding reduction in spatial resolution .",
    "this problem has particularly afflicted ground - based optical spectroscopic studies , that typically sample nuclei with apertures encompassing hundreds of parsecs or more .    to investigate the structure and constituents of galaxy nuclei on small scales",
    ", we therefore undertook a survey of nearby nuclei with stis ( sunns ) , a program of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , narrow - slit spectroscopy for a sample of nearby galaxies outside the local group .",
    "the target objects were selected on the basis of nebular emission in their centers , and are thus `` active '' in some sense , although at low levels that are very common in bright galaxies .",
    "the sunns data are appropriate for addressing several major questions , as described in part in our previous papers in this series .",
    "the long - slit measurements of gas kinematics can be used to measure or place limits on the mass of a central black hole ( sarzi et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the spectra coupled with _",
    "hst _ imaging can be used further to probe the structure of nuclear gas disks , which we find to be influenced in many cases by nongravitational effects ( ho et al .",
    "the use of small apertures is very helpful in isolating nuclear emission components that are lost in the contamination by circumnuclear sources , as demonstrated by our discovery of unusual broad - line emission in two galaxies ( shields et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al . 2000 ) .",
    "small apertures are also important for obtaining a description of the stellar population and star formation history within the central tens of parsecs ( sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "in the current paper we present a summary description of the sunns experimental design , and focus on new results for the nuclear emission - line characteristics of the sample .",
    "the spatial distribution and excitation properties of nebular emission can be used to draw conclusions about the dominant energy sources in galaxy centers , and as part of our investigation we explore the significance of aperture effects in determining the spectroscopic appearance of galaxy nuclei .",
    "understanding the energetics of emission - line nuclei is of fundamental importance for tracing rates of star formation and black hole growth in these low - power but nearly ubiquitous objects .",
    "the data reported here also provide an improved basis for comparing energetic phenomena and structure in the milky way s nucleus with the centers of other similar galaxies .",
    "_ hst _ observations ( go-7361 ) were obtained for 24 galaxies within 17 mpc of the milky way , drawn from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies ( filippenko & sargent 1985 ; ho , filippenko & sargent 1997a ) .",
    "the sample was chosen to be distance - limited to maximize spatial resolution , and was selected to have nebular emission potentially suitable for kinematic studies and energetic probes .",
    "we focused our study on disk galaxies , since these objects most commonly show nebular emission in their centers .",
    "we restricted the sample to hubble types s0  sbc , since the nuclei of later types are more likely to be weakly defined , affected by dust , or otherwise subject to confusion .",
    "the sample was limited to galaxies with inclinations @xmath2 to minimize extinction by dust residing in the disk .",
    "we selected objects with h@xmath1 or [ ] @xmath36583 line emission @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath6 within a @xmath7 aperture ( from ho et al .",
    "1997a ) , with spectroscopic classifications fairly evenly distributed among seyfert ,",
    "liner 1 , liner 2 , liner/ `` transition , '' and categories .",
    "the result is listed in table 1 .",
    "data were acquired in 1998 and 1999 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board _ hst _ , using the 02 @xmath8 50  aperture . for each galaxy , acquisition images",
    "were obtained using the f28x50lp long - pass filter with 30 s integration , and peak - up exposures were taken in order to center the spectrograph slit on the target nucleus .",
    "inspection of these and other archival _ hst _ images indicates that in all but one case , the aperture was well - centered on an obvious brightness peak at the morphological center , with no indication of confusion by dust obscuration or other structure ; errors in aperture centering due to dust effects are @xmath9 pixels @xmath10 .",
    "the exception occurred in ngc  4138 , where the peak - up procedure positioned the slit on a bright foreground star offset @xmath11 from the nucleus ; we consequently dropped this object from our analysis . the slit position angle ( pa )",
    "was left unconstrained and thus was set by the spacecraft roll angle at the time of observation . for a given galaxy , all exposures were obtained at a single pa .    two - dimensional ( 2-d )",
    "spectra were obtained with the g430l and g750 m gratings , yielding spectra spanning 33005700 and 63006850 with fwhm spectral resolution for extended sources of 10.9 and 2.2  , respectively .",
    "these intervals were chosen in order to include prominent emission lines , and to measure continuum intervals diagnostic of stellar populations and possible active galactic nucleus ( agn ) contributions .",
    "the medium - resolution grating was selected for the red setting so as to enable high precision velocity measurements of the h@xmath1 @xmath36563 and [ ] @xmath126548 , 6583 lines , which tend to be the strongest optical emission features , and hence optimal for kinematic studies .",
    "two exposures totaling @xmath13 s and three exposures totaling @xmath14 s were obtained with the blue and red settings , respectively . for most of the target galaxies",
    ", the telescope pointing was adjusted between duplicate exposures so as to shift the location of the nucleus along the slit by increments of several pixels , to facilitate removal of hot pixels .",
    "the resulting data were calibrated using standard methods .",
    "the 2-d spectra were bias- and dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , aligned , and combined into single frames .",
    "cosmic rays and hot pixels remaining in the combined 2-d spectra were cleaned according to the prescription of rudnick , rix , & kennicutt ( 2000 ) , and the spectra were then corrected for geometrical distortion and wavelength and flux calibrated with standard stsdas procedures within iraf . during each reduction step , care was taken to correctly propagate the information contained in the error array corresponding to each galaxy 2-d spectrum and initially provided by the stis pipeline .    to represent the nuclear spectrum of each galaxy , we extracted aperture spectra five pixels wide ( @xmath15 ) , centered on the brightest part of the continuum , using the iraf task apall .",
    "the extracted spectra thus consist of the central emission convolved with the stis spatial point - spread function and sampled over an aperture of @xmath16 , roughly corresponding to a circular aperture with radius @xmath17 , or 8.2 pc for the mean sample distance of @xmath1813 mpc ( or @xmath19 pc for the full range of galaxy distances ) . in addition , from the 2-d error array corresponding to each 2-d spectrum , we extracted the central five , one - pixel - wide aperture spectra , and added them quadratically to obtain the error array corresponding to each nuclear extraction .",
    "the resulting 1-d spectra for the blue ( g430l ) setting appear in sarzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , while those for the red ( g750 m ) setting are shown here in figure 1 .",
    "the emission - line equivalent widths in the nuclear spectra are often small and consequently require subtraction of the underlying starlight in order to measure accurate emission - line fluxes .",
    "we modeled the continuum with linear combinations of stellar spectra from the miles library of sanchez - blazquez et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , with weights and velocity broadening optimized with the direct - fitting method described in sarzi et al .",
    "this is similar to the method of rix & white ( 1992 ) , except that the spectral regions affected by nebular emission are no longer excluded from the fitting process , since the emission - lines are treated as gaussian templates and fitted simultaneously with the stellar templates to the observed spectra .",
    "this has the advantage of maximising the spectral information available to the fitting algorithm .    as the blue and red spectra have different spectral resolutions they can not be fitted simultaneously .",
    "on the other hand , the presence of stronger emission lines and the limited number of absorption features makes it difficult to independently match the stellar continuum of the red bandpass .",
    "we therefore fit first the blue spectra , which are important for constraining the mix of template stellar types , and use the resulting optimal combination of templates to match the red spectra , allowing only for a different velocity broadening .",
    "the fitting of the blue spectra include reddening due to interstellar dust , both in the milky way and in the sample galaxies , and due to dust in the emission - line regions .",
    "the latter affects only the fluxes of the emission - line templates , and is constrained by the expected decrement of the balmer lines . in matching the blue spectra we imposed the same kinematics for both forbidden and recombination lines .",
    "we also restricted the stellar template library to spectra with values for the h@xmath20 absorption line - strength index exceeding 0.1 .    in the present study we are interested in obtaining the best empirical fit to the starlight , and",
    "no a priori assumptions are made concerning the relative weighting of different stellar types ; our method here consequently differs somewhat from that employed in our population analysis ( sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ) which is based on templates corresponding to parametrized star formation histories .",
    "the fits to the blue spectra are very similar to the parametrized fits plotted in sarzi et al ( 2005 ) , although the miles spectra can match several spectral regions where models such as those of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) would need to account for non - solar abundance of @xmath1-elements before they can match the data .",
    "the best description for the stellar continuum in the red bandpass is overplotted on the spectra shown in figure  1 .",
    "the fits for the red spectra differ from those for the blue bandpass not only in that they use a different velocity broadening and the optimal combination of templates from the fit on the blue spectra , but also in that they employ a generalized multiplicative second - order polynomial adjustment instead of a specific dust reddening law .",
    "emission - line templates were used also while fitting the red spectra , although for galaxies with complex line profiles or broad components , the regions affected by emission were simply excluded from the fit .    for many of our target objects ,",
    "the emission lines within the nuclear aperture are weak .",
    "we attempted to measure lines that were visible in much of the sample on inspection , or likely to be present based on the behavior of line - intensity ratios in other nebular sources .",
    "specifically , we measured or placed limits on the flux in [ ]  @xmath33727 , h@xmath21  @xmath34340 , h@xmath20  @xmath34861 , [ ]  @xmath124959 , 5007 , [ ]  @xmath36300 , [ ]  @xmath126548 , 6583 , h@xmath1  @xmath36563 , and [ ]  @xmath126716 , 6731 .",
    "the lines were measured from the starlight - subtracted spectra using specfit ( kriss 1994 ) as implemented in iraf .",
    "this routine is suitable for fitting complicated line profiles with additional contraints between lines , while also generating error estimates for measured quantities .",
    "gaussian profiles were assumed for the lines ; a few sources required double gaussians to obtain a good match to the observed lines , and additional components were included in cases where there was evidence of broad balmer emission (  3.3 ) .    to improve the fitting accuracy , we introduced constraints to reduce the number of fit parameters when justified by physical arguments , or by our previous experience with ground - based spectra ( e.g. , ho et al .",
    "the h@xmath1 , [ ] , and [ ] lines were assumed to share a common centroid velocity , and the [ ] and [ ] lines were assumed to share a common velocity width .",
    "a flux ratio of 1:3 was assumed for the [ ] @xmath126548 , 6583 and [ ] @xmath124959 , 5007 doublets , as dictated by atomic physics ( e.g. , osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 lines were also assumed to share a common velocity and profile .",
    "the g430l and g750 m spectra were fit separately because of their differing spectral resolution and possible zero - point wavelength offsets . in determining relative wavelengths for lines with shared velocities , rest wavelengths to 6 significant figures",
    "were taken from kaufman & sugar ( 1986 ) for the forbidden lines and from wiese , smith , & glennon ( 1966 ) for the balmer lines .",
    "the resulting line fluxes are listed in table 2 .",
    "the line fluxes are uncertain due to both statistical fluctuations and systematic errors .",
    "specfit uses a @xmath22 minimization algorithm , which provides one estimate of the line flux uncertainties . as a measure of the possible systematic error",
    ", we also calculated an equivalent 1@xmath23 gaussian uncertainty based on the standard deviation @xmath24 per pixel in the residual continuum after starlight subtraction .",
    "the standard deviation was computed in regions devoid of emission lines and traces structure due to imperfect continuum subtraction , in addition to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the corresponding error is then given by a gaussian profile with amplitude of 1@xmath24 , and a width typical of the measured narrow lines ( fwhm of 300 km s@xmath5 for g750 m and 550 km s@xmath5 for g430l , where the width includes instrumental broadening ) .",
    "in determining a final value for the flux uncertainty , we adopted the largest of 1 ) the specfit error , 2 ) the gaussian 1@xmath23 uncertainty , and 3 ) a conservative minimum error of 10% of the line flux .",
    "as a consistency test , we repeated the line measurements after subtracting the best - fit multi - age stellar population models for these spectra that are described by sarzi et al .",
    "line fluxes were measured from the continuum - subtracted spectra by direct integration over the line profile , using splot in iraf .",
    "the results showed good consistency within the measurement uncertainties with the values listed in table 2 .",
    "the _ hst _ aperture employed for this study is much smaller than typical ground - based apertures , and a comparison of nebular properties as seen on these different scales provides useful information on the structure of emission nuclei .",
    "the palomar spectra used to define the current sample employed a @xmath25 aperture , which is @xmath26 larger in linear dimension and @xmath27 larger in area than the sunns nuclear aperture .",
    "the linear scales probed by these data are @xmath28 vs @xmath29 pc .",
    "the degree to which the nebular emission in our sample galaxies is centrally concentrated can be gauged from a comparison of fluxes measured through the sunns and palomar apertures .",
    "the result is shown in figure 2 , which displays the ratio of narrow h@xmath1 fluxes as a function of palomar spectroscopic class .",
    "the sequence of categories on the abscissa is intended to reflect the degree to which the nuclei show evidence of being powered by accretion . in this and",
    "subsequent figures displaying ratios , the plotted error bars are propagated from the uncertainties listed in table 2 for the sunns measurements and in ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) for the palomar data .",
    "for a uniform nebular surface brightness , the flux ratio should be @xmath30 dex . in the majority of cases the ratio is measured to be higher , indicating some degree of central concentration .",
    "on the other hand , for all of the galaxies , the small - aperture measurement shows a significant reduction in flux relative to the palomar value , indicating that the central nebulae in these objects are resolved at _ hst _ resolution .",
    "figure 2 shows evidence of a trend in that sources showing the strongest indications of accretion power ( liner 1s and seyferts ) display the largest ratios , implying greater concentration .",
    "in contrast , the nuclei show the smallest ratios , and in fact four of the five nuclei are undetected in h@xmath1 in the sunns aperture .",
    "the star formation powering `` nuclei '' apparently resides on scales of tens of parsecs or more ( see , e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "2003 , cid fernandes et al .",
    "2004 , and gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "2004 for related results ) .",
    "the narrow emission - line equivalent widths ( ews ; see table 2 and figure 3 ) show a similar trend , with larger ew(h@xmath1 ) found in the sunns aperture for the liner 1 and seyfert nuclei , but smaller ew(h@xmath1 ) in the small aperture for the majority of , transition , and liner 2 nuclei .      while a direct measurement of line ratio gradients is possible in principle from the _",
    "hst _ long - slit data , in practice the signal - to - noise ratio severely hampers detailed study of spatial variations .",
    "comparison of line ratios measured in the sunns and palomar apertures provides an alternative means of quantifying excitation gradients .",
    "in addition to yielding a factor of @xmath31 more signal , the palomar aperture avoids possible problems with azimuthal variations in extended emission that are not adequately sampled by the narrow sunns slit .",
    "line ratios useful as diagnostics that are also measured for a significant number of sample members are limited , but four particularly relevant ratios are [ ] @xmath35007/h@xmath20 , [ ] @xmath36300/h@xmath1 , [ ] @xmath36583/h@xmath1 , and [ ] @xmath126716 , 6731/h@xmath1 .",
    "these diagnostics are commonly employed in classification of nebular sources ( e.g. , veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) , and standard diagrams used for this purpose are shown in figure 4 , with measurements from both palomar and sunns plotted .",
    "there is considerable variation in the behavior of different objects in figure 4 , but several conclusions can nonetheless be drawn from these plots .",
    "first , the line ratios are often rather insensitive to aperture size , and in the present comparison show changes that are usually less than a factor of two .",
    "related to this , the sources generally do not shift their position by large amounts in the line ratio diagrams , which means that their classification is insensitive to aperture size .",
    "this finding has interesting and important implications that we examine in detail below .",
    "one limitation of the two - dimensional line ratio diagrams is that the sunns observations provide only upper limits for both [ ] and h@xmath20 for nearly half the sample , thus preventing their inclusion in figure 4 .",
    "an alternative is to compare line intensity ratios individually , and for this purpose we plot in figure 5 the `` ratio of ratios '' for the measurements obtained in the two apertures .",
    "several patterns are discernable in figure 5 .",
    "[ ] /h@xmath1 is arguably the best indicator of excitation beyond the contributions of normal regions , since it requires a significant partially ionized zone for its production .",
    "the [ ] line is in fact most significant in the liner 1 and seyfert nuclei , and figure 5 shows a clear tendency for the ratio to be larger in the small aperture for these sources . a weaker trend in the same direction exists for [ ] /h@xmath1 , but no trend is evident for [ ] /h@xmath1 .",
    "the more limited measurements of [ ] /h@xmath20 show little dependence on aperture size , except for some tendency for the ratio to decrease in the small aperture in the seyfert nuclei .",
    "density gradients may be a factor in the nebular emission structure reflected in figure 5 .",
    "previous studies have shown indirect evidence from line width - critical density correlations ( e.g. , pelat , alloin , & fosbury 1981 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ) as well as direct evidence from the [ ] density diagnostic ( barth et al .",
    "2001 ) that densities increase toward small radii in the narrow - line regions of agns .",
    "figure 6 shows the density - sensitive [ ] @xmath36716/@xmath36731 line ratio for the sample sources as measured in both the palomar and sunns spectra . the ratio is lower in all but one case for the small aperture measurement , implicating a characteristically higher density on smaller radial scales ; median values are 1.2 from the palomar measurements and 0.95 from sunns , corresponding to densities of @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "these values are presumably emissivity - weighted averages of a potentially much broader span of densities .",
    "the different spectral classes show substantial overlap in their distributions in figure 6 .",
    "the different behavior observed in the [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] lines in figure 5 can potentially be understood as a consequence of the varied critical densities for the forbidden lines .",
    "in the sunns aperture a significant fraction of the nebular gas for the liners and seyferts evidently has a density similar to or greater than the [ ] @xmath126716 , 6731 critical densities @xmath35 of @xmath36 @xmath33 and @xmath37 @xmath33 ( e.g. , peterson 1997 ) , which could act to depress the [ ] /h@xmath1 ratio in the small aperture . the [ ]",
    "@xmath35 values are the lowest of those for the lines shown in figure 5 . in contrast , [ ] @xmath36300 , with @xmath38 @xmath33 , remains strong in the small aperture ; the larger [ ] /h@xmath1 ratios found with sunns may reflect an increased importance of partially ionized gas on small scales , but would also be consistent with a higher nebular temperature in dense regions where cooling by low-@xmath35 emission ( e.g. , from infrared fine - structure lines ) is inefficient .",
    "[ ] @xmath36583 , with an intermediate @xmath35 value of @xmath39 @xmath33 , shows a weaker trend in the same direction .",
    "the overall results suggest that a significant fraction of the nebular gas in galaxies on scales of @xmath29 pc has densities of @xmath40 @xmath33",
    ". the [ ] @xmath35007 line , with @xmath41 @xmath33 , does not readily fit into this scenario .",
    "for the seyfert nuclei in particular , the [ ] /h@xmath20 ratio tends to decrease in the small aperture , and there is some degree of negative correlation between the [ ] /h@xmath20 and [ ] /h@xmath1 ratios , suggesting that ionization structure  which will be sensitive to ionization parameter and hence the detailed radial variation in density  also plays a role in the aperture dependence .",
    "the existing palomar observations provided evidence that six of our 23 target galaxies exhibit weak quasar - like broad h@xmath1 emission , resulting in classification as liner 1.9 ( ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , ngc  4450 ) or seyfert 1.9 ( ngc  3982 , ngc 4501 ) nuclei ( ho et al .",
    "we investigated whether a broad component was also present in the _ hst _ spectra for these sources and the other objects in our sample .",
    "the sunns data for two of the liner 1.9 galaxies , ngc  4203 and ngc  4450 , display evidence of not only a gaussian broad h@xmath1 line , as seen from the ground , but also a very broad , double - shouldered component ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; these findings are discussed in detail elsewhere ( shields et al .",
    "2000 ; ho et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we attribute the discovery of the additional broad features to the improved contrast in the small _ hst _ aperture between the broad emission , which presumably arises within @xmath42 pc of the center , and the stellar continuum plus narrow - line emission , which is more widely dispersed in origin .",
    "the implication is that such broad emission may be common in low - luminosity agns , and a signature of the accretion structure in low accretion - rate nuclei .",
    "other examples of double - shouldered emission profiles found in _ hst _ spectra of liner 1 nuclei are described by bower et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and barth et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "figure 7 shows the results of a profile decomposition using the sunns data for the remaining four galaxies where broad emission was previously suspected .",
    "a common profile shape was employed to represent the [ ] , narrow h@xmath1 , and [ ] lines ; double gaussians were adopted to better match the profiles for ngc  3982 and ngc  4143 .",
    "an additional broad h@xmath1 component with unconstrained width and central wavelength was included in the fit .",
    "strong evidence for a broad emission feature is found in ngc  2787 and ngc  4143 , while marginal evidence for such emission is present in ngc  4501 , and a reasonable fit for ngc  3982 can be obtained with no broad component . the narrow - line fluxes resulting from this decomposition are listed in table 2 ; broad - line fluxes and the fraction @xmath43 of the total h@xmath1 + [ ] complex represented by the broad h@xmath1 feature are listed in table 3 , along with the corresponding numbers measured in the palomar spectra .",
    "for the four galaxies where broad emission appears to be confirmed ( ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , and ngc  4450 ) , @xmath43 increases if these values are taken at face value , as expected if the narrow emission is resolved and diminished in the small aperture while the broad emission remains unaffected by slit losses .",
    "closer scrutiny of the deblending results suggests a problem with the fitting procedure , however .",
    "the values listed in table 2 imply h@xmath1/h@xmath20 ratios for the narrow component of ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) for ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , and ngc  4450 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are considerably smaller than the theoretical ratio of 3.1 predicted for agn narrow - line regions ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and are impossible to understand on physical grounds .",
    "the low values are unlikely to be caused by broad - line contamination of h@xmath20 ; ngc  4203 and ngc  4450 both show evidence of broad emission in h@xmath20 and h@xmath21 , but this component is included as a separate component when determining the narrow balmer fluxes .",
    "no evidence of broad emission is seen in these lines for ngc  2787 and ngc  4143 .",
    "the narrow h@xmath21/h@xmath20 ratios are , moreover , normal : ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , and ngc  4450 display h@xmath21/h@xmath20 = @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , respectively , in reasonable agreement with the predicted recombination value of @xmath52 .",
    "there is no evidence of significant discontinuities between the g430l and g750 m spectra indicative of flux calibration errors ; almost all of the other objects in our sample show narrow h@xmath1/h@xmath20 ratios consistent with the theoretical prediction ( ngc  4698 has a ratio of @xmath53 ) , or a larger ratio attributable to reddening .",
    "it is noteworthy that for the four galaxies in question , the forbidden line / h@xmath1 flux ratios are unusually large for liners or seyfert nuclei ( although it must be kept in mind that the sunns aperture does not sample the full narrow - line region ) .    given these findings , we strongly suspect that the deblending procedure outlined above and illustrated in figure 7 underestimates the true narrow h@xmath1 flux which in turn would produce an overestimate of the broad component flux .",
    "we experimented with alternative parameterizations of the fits for ngc  2787 and ngc  4143 , including decoupling of the narrow h@xmath1 line widths from the other lines , forcing the narrow h@xmath1 flux to match the value predicted from h@xmath20 , and forcing the narrow h@xmath1 width to match that of h@xmath20 . in general",
    ", these approaches were not particularly satisfactory at matching the detailed profile structure , resulting in residuals larger than seen in figure 7 .",
    "this outcome suggests that the narrow and/or broad profiles are rather more complex than simple gaussians and that significant differences may exist between the different narrow - line profiles . a possible broader component of [ ] than is currently represented in our deblending model",
    "may also be suggested by the redward displacement of the broad h@xmath1 feature relative to the narrow emission found in the four galaxies at issue here , since the stronger line in the doublet , @xmath36583 , would thereby add flux that our default model would interpret as redshifted h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we therefore caution that the fluxes of narrow h@xmath1 and possibly [ ] in table 2 for these objects may suffer from systematic errors in excess of the listed uncertainties . for purposes of comparison with the palomar results , however , the fact that we employed a very similar fitting algorithm may mitigate the influence of these errors .",
    "it is noteworthy that the palomar measurements from ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) yield h@xmath1/h@xmath20 ratios of 1.9 , 1.6 , 1.0 , and 2.6 for ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , and ngc  4450 , respectively , which likewise fall short of the recombination prediction and suggest similar systematic errors to what we have encountered with the sunns data . in ratioing the sunns measurements to the palomar measurements ( e.g. , in figures 2 , 3 , and 5 ) , we can thus expect these errors to cancel out at least partially .",
    "a best estimate of the true narrow h@xmath1 flux is probably that derived from the narrow h@xmath20 flux , scaled by the recombination prediction , which yields ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath55 ) @xmath57 ergs s@xmath5 @xmath6 for ngc  2787 , ngc  4143 , ngc  4203 , and ngc  4450 , respectively .",
    "comparison of the sunns broad h@xmath1 fluxes with those from palomar reveals a surprising trend , in that the sunns flux is in all cases smaller . taking the profile decomposition results at face value ,",
    "the median reduction is a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "it is not clear how this outcome could result from systematic errors in the deblending process .",
    "we also do not expect the broad feature to suffer from aperture losses in the sunns data , since the emission is expected to arise from sub - parsec scales .",
    "for spatially unresolved sources the stis flux calibration corrects for aperture transmission losses to within an accuracy of @xmath59% at h@xmath1 ( bohlin & hartig 1998 ) . the present result",
    "could be understood physically if the broad emission is variable ; the sources in the palomar survey identified as l1.9 or s1.9 nuclei would then have preferentially been in a high flux state , since sensitivity limits dictate that objects in low flux states would not be detected as broad - line objects .",
    "if the sources vary on timescales shorter than the decade interval between the palomar and sunns observations , we would then expect that the broad h@xmath1 flux would be lower in a majority of cases in the second - epoch observation .",
    "we would also predict that some number of sources seen as type 2 nuclei in the palomar data would display new detectable broad components at the second epoch .",
    "variability in broad line emission would not be surprising and has been reported in similar low - luminosity agns previously ( e.g. , eracleous & halpern 2001 and references therein ) .    for the sources in our sample that appear in the palomar spectra as narrow - line objects , it is therefore a surprise that the _ hst _ spectra provide no new indications of broad h@xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion was reached after examining the residuals from fitting with purely narrow - line profiles as described above .",
    "the lack of newly detected broad - line sources is curious with respect to the variability prediction noted above , but also given the expected increase in sensitivity in the small _ hst _ aperture due to the reduction in circumnuclear contamination .",
    "investigation of a larger sample would be desirable in order to clarify the generality of this result and its implications .",
    "an interesting question that can be addressed with the results of this study is the extent to which the spectroscopic classification of a galaxy nucleus depends on the measurement aperture employed .",
    "the results from  3.1 indicate that the sunns aperture typically excludes most of the emission that is seen in the palomar measurement , and that nebulosity that is clearly dominated by an accretion source tends to be the most centrally concentrated .",
    "we might therefore expect the _",
    "aperture to isolate gas that is higher in excitation / ionization and more dominated by the central engine , to the extent that one is present .",
    "likewise , the small - aperture measurement should increase the probability of detection for broad h@xmath1 components . in summary ,",
    "the simple prediction from these considerations is that the sunns nuclear spectra should appear more agn - like than the corresponding palomar spectra , for nuclei where accretion is important as a power source .",
    "objects of particular interest in this regard are the /liner transition nuclei .",
    "these sources are intermediate in their emission properties between nuclei and liners or seyfert nuclei ( e.g. , ho et al . 1997a ; hao et al . 2005 ) ; other labels applied to such objects are `` composite nuclei '' ( e.g. , kennicutt , keel , & blaha 1989 ; vron , gonalves , & vron - cetty 1997 ) and `` weak [ ] liners '' ( e.g. , filippenko & terlevich 1992 ) .",
    "the standard interpretation for these sources , which are very common ( @xmath60% of bright galaxies ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997c ) , is that their spectra trace a mix of agn emission and circumnuclear regions .",
    "this picture is supported by kinematically distinct emission for the two components in some galaxies ( vron et al .",
    "1997 ) , and by aperture - dependent line ratios on kpc scales for agns that may reflect different admixtures of the two emission sources ( storchi - bergmann 1991 ) . under this scenario",
    ", we would expect the nuclei to more strongly resemble liners or seyferts in the _ hst _ spectra , since the small aperture should act to exclude a part of the circumnuclear nebulosity .    from the results reported in",
    " 3 there is only limited support for these predictions .",
    "the liner 1s and seyfert nuclei show a modest aperture dependence in the line ratios that appears to reflect at least partially density effects (  3.2 ) . to the extent that ionization gradients are present",
    ", it seems that the ionization often _ decreases _ on smaller scales . if we apply to the sunns measurements the same classification criteria as employed by ho et al .",
    "( 1997a ) for the palomar observations , we find that only three objects formally change their classification .",
    "ngc  3992 and ngc  4548 , classified respectively as a transition object and a liner 2 in the palomar spectra , show higher excitation in the small aperture , with an /h@xmath20 ratio consistent with a borderline seyfert identification .",
    "conversely , ngc  4698 , with a palomar classification as a seyfert 2 , shows a decrease in excitation in the sunns data consistent with classification as a liner or transition nucleus .",
    "the composite model for transition objects is not strongly supported by these data .",
    "approximately half of the admittedly small original sample of transition sources shows little aperture dependence in the line ratios , and in particular these objects do not appear as pure liners or seyferts in the sunns measurement .",
    "none of the narrow - line objects reveal new evidence of broad h@xmath1 emission when viewed at _ hst _ resolution ( see also gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the behavior of the transition objects is a surprise .",
    "the lack of strong emission - line gradients in some sources may indicate that the length scale over which the photoionizing energy of an accretion source is deposited is comparable to that of a circumnuclear star - forming zone ( i.e. @xmath28 pc ) , so that the influence of both energy sources is spatially commingled .",
    "this would involve a different gas distribution or geometry than is typical of the liner 1s and seyferts , which tend to have highly concentrated nebulosity around an accretion source , and may have interesting implications for the available fuel supply .",
    "alternatively , a distributed ionization source , such as turbulent mixing layers ( e.g. , begelman & fabian 1990 ) or evolved stars ( e.g. binette et al .",
    "1994 ) , rather than simply a central accretion source , may be important in these nuclei ; the magnetic field may also be energetically significant in these regions .",
    "a distributed source is potentially supported by our finding that transition and liner 2 nuclei in the sunns sample preferentially show evidence of a nuclear component of stars with ages @xmath42 gyr ( sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ; see also gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "investigation of a larger sample of transition objects is important for defining the properties of these sources and determining their nature .",
    "the decrease in ionization with decreasing radius in the seyfert 2 nuclei is likewise unexpected , and scrutiny of larger samples is needed to understand this finding .",
    "integral - field spectroscopic observations could prove useful to understanding the role of different ionizing sources at different radii , as recently shown by mazzuca et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in their study of the galaxy ngc  7742 , which hosts a circumnuclear starburst and an active nucleus of composite nature .      while the sample studied here consists of nearby emission nuclei",
    ", there is one such source notably missing from our study , namely the milky way nucleus . integrating the galactic center into a larger context of galaxy nuclei",
    "is complicated observationally by the large extinction to this region ( @xmath61 mag ; rieke , rieke , & paul 1989 ) , and by its close proximity , which results in an angular scale ( 1@xmath62 0.1 pc ) substantially different from extragalactic sources .",
    "spectroscopic measurements obtained for both external galaxies and the galactic center on the _ same _ metric scale in the _ same _ bandpass remain very limited .",
    "the sunns data , however , offer a new basis for comparison by at least matching the approximate metric scale of many measurements of the galactic center .    the milky way , like the sunns galaxies , is host to a low - luminosity emission nucleus .",
    "the rate of photoionizations by lyman continuum photons for the galactic center is tabulated as a function of radius by mezger , duschl , & zylka ( 1996 , @xmath63 in their table 6 ) , based on radio measurements of free - free emission .",
    "after rescaling to a distance to the galactic center of @xmath64 kpc , the results indicate @xmath65 s@xmath5 within @xmath66 pc and @xmath67 s@xmath5 within @xmath68 pc .",
    "the h@xmath1 luminosity @xmath69 emerging within @xmath70 pc predicted from recombination theory with negligible extinction would be @xmath71 ergs s@xmath5",
    ". objects with this @xmath69 are common in the full palomar spectroscopic survey , which has a slightly lower median @xmath72 ergs s@xmath5 for an equivalent radius of @xmath73 pc ( i.e. , for a circular aperture with area equal to the rectangular palomar aperture ; ho et al .",
    "allowing for modest extinction of the galactic center emission and the somewhat different metric apertures would bring the milky way value closer to the palomar median . for comparison purposes with sunns ,",
    "an estimate of @xmath63 within @xmath74 pc for the galaxy would be desirable , but is not readily available ; with the existing data we can nonetheless estimate that the ratio of recombination luminosities within @xmath75 and @xmath28 pc is approximately one order of magnitude , which is broadly consistent with our measured ratio for other galaxies ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the galactic center is thus a very typical nucleus in terms of its nebular luminosity and concentration .",
    "the sunns data provide a further basis for comparing interstellar conditions in the galactic center with those in other galaxy nuclei .",
    "nebular densities within @xmath29 pc tend to be rather high . as discussed in  3.2 , the [ ] diagnostic indicates a typical density of @xmath76 @xmath33 , but other lines point to the presence of gas with densities of @xmath77 @xmath33 in the sunns nuclei .",
    "very similar results are found in the galactic center , using constraints from infrared fine - structure line ratios and emission measures ( e.g. , genzel , hollenbach , & townes 1994 ; beckert et al .",
    "1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "spectra do not provide quantitative constraints on the gas - phase abundances , although our analysis of the _ stellar _ abundances with these data indicates that typical metallicities @xmath78 z@xmath79 ( sarzi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this range matches estimates of the nebular metallicity of the galactic center ( shields & ferland 1994 ) , and estimates of metallicity for stars in the central parsecs also suggest a typical value of @xmath80 z@xmath79 ( ramrez et al .",
    "2000 ; blum et al . 2003 ) .",
    "although we can not see the optical spectrum of the galactic center , we can make some inferences about its optical spectral class from the results noted above and other measurements .",
    "the galactic center provides compelling evidence for the presence of a black hole with a mass @xmath81 m@xmath79 ( e.g. , schdel et al .",
    "2003 ; ghez 2004 ) ; this mass and the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath82 for the milk way bulge are in reasonable accord with the @xmath83 correlation defined by other galaxies .",
    "the central black hole is apparently accreting , based on its appearance as the compact radio source sgr a@xmath84 ( balick & brown 1974 ) and an associated x - ray source ( baganoff et al .",
    "the accretion luminosity is , however , very feeble ( @xmath85 ergs s@xmath5 ; narayan et al .",
    "1998 , and references therein ) , and thus insufficient to power a significant fraction of the nebular emission .",
    "the nebular emission on scales from @xmath86 pc ( e.g. , lutz et al .",
    "1996 ) to @xmath87 pc ( e.g. , simpson et al . 1999 ) is characterized by low - ionization lines .",
    "the lack of both a strong compact x - ray source and high - ionization nebulosity implies that the milky way is not a seyfert nucleus .",
    "likewise , the central parsec of the galaxy does not exhibit strong , quasar - like permitted lines from high - velocity gas ; the galactic center is not a broad - line ( type 1 ) nucleus .    would our counterparts in other galaxies regard the milky way as any sort of agn , of the types found in the palomar spectroscopic survey ?",
    "if so , our galaxy would have to be a liner or /liner transition object .",
    "a liner generated via photoionization is excluded , based on the absence of a significant compact hard x - ray source to power the nebulosity , as well as from detailed aspects of the infrared and radio emission lines ( shields & ferland 1994 ; lutz et al . 1996 ) .",
    "recent observations with _",
    "reveal diffuse hard x - ray emission from the central @xmath88 pc , with a luminosity of @xmath89 ergs s@xmath5 ( muno et al .",
    "2004 ) . while insufficient to power significant nebular emission directly , the hard x - rays are of uncertain origin , and would require a kinetic energy input of @xmath90 ergs s@xmath5 if generated in ( unbound ) thermal plasma ( see muno et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "if a fraction of this mechanical energy were transferred to the nebular plasma , it could modify the excitation of the gas , resulting in enhancement of optical collisionally excited lines .",
    "however , the nebular gas is clearly not heavily shocked ; the plasma is not highly ionized , and at least within @xmath91 pc of the center , the electron temperature as revealed by radio line - to - continuum ratios is only @xmath92 k ( roberts & goss 1993 ) .",
    "while this value may be slightly higher than expected from simple stellar photoionization ( shields & ferland 1994 ) , it appears that the gas is not heated sufficiently to power optical forbidden lines at the level seen in liners .",
    "we conclude that the center of the milky way would appear spectroscopically as an nucleus or possibly a transition object for an extragalactic optical observer . as in most of the sunns galaxies ( sarzi et al .",
    "2005 ) , the inner stellar bulge of our galaxy is predominantly old ( blum et al . 2003 ; van loon et al . 2003",
    "; although cf .",
    "figer et al .",
    "2004 ) , but some star formation has occurred in recent episodes , and in the case of the milky way , the ultraviolet radiation from normal massive stars apparently dominates the nebular ionization . for galaxies like our own , with a hubble type of approximately sbc , the palomar spectroscopic survey found that the fractions hosting and transition nuclei are @xmath93% and @xmath94% , respectively ( ho et al .",
    "1997c ) . in its",
    "nebular excitation , star formation history , and relation to the larger galaxy , the milky way again has a very typical nucleus .",
    "ground - based spectroscopic surveys indicate that the majority of galaxies host emission - line nuclei , and the sunns results provide new insights into the structure and energetics of these nebular sources .",
    "the findings presented here indicate that the emitting gas is spatially distributed on scales of @xmath28 pc , with accretion - powered objects showing a significant degree of concentration in the observed emission . within these regions ,",
    "modest radial gradients in optical emission - line ratios are seen ; density gradients evidently play an important role in driving these trends , although there is some evidence as well for ionization gradients in the plasma .",
    "liner/ transition nuclei show only mixed indications of a simple composite spatial structure , contrary to expectations , suggesting that distributed sources of ionization beyond normal o - type stars may be involved in powering these common objects .",
    "these findings provide a framework for gauging the extent to which the center of the milky way is a typical galaxy nucleus .",
    "the galactic center is very similar to other emission - line nuclei in terms of its nebular luminosity , surface brightness distribution , and ionization . combining the present results with other published findings ,",
    "it is additionally clear that the galactic center resembles the nuclei of other systems in terms of its metallicity and stellar population , and likewise its black hole mass and probable spectroscopic class , considered in relation to the bulge properties of the host galaxy . as a laboratory for the study of galaxy nuclei , the center of the milky way thus provides a very representative example .",

    "<S> this paper provides a description of the experimental design , and new findings from the study of emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the sample targets span a range of nebular spectroscopic class , from to seyfert nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this data set and the resulting measurements are unique in terms of the sample size , the range of nebular class , and the investigation of physical scales extending down to parsecs . </S>",
    "<S> the line ratios indicative of nebular ionization show only modest variations over order - of - magnitude differences in radius , and demonstrate in a systematic way that geometrical dilution of the radiation field from a central source can not be assumed as a primary driver of ionization structure . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons between large- and small - aperture measurements for the /liner transition objects provide a new test that challenges conventional wisdom concerning the composite nature of these systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also list a number of other quantitative results that are of interest for understanding galaxy nuclei , including ( 1 ) the spatial distribution / degree of concentration of h@xmath1 emission as a function of nebular type ; ( 2 ) the radial variation in electron density as a function of nebular type ; and ( 3 ) quantitative broad h@xmath1 estimates obtained at a second epoch for these low - luminosity nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting measurements provide a new basis for comparing the nuclei of other galaxies with that of the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the galactic center is representative across a wide span of properties as a low - luminosity emission - line nucleus . </S>"
