    "one can then determine the size of the anisotropies as a function of @xmath3 , with larger @xmath3 corresponding to smaller angles , and hence smaller length scales .",
    "current cmb observation probe this power spectrum down to ( comoving ) length scales of about one mpc .",
    "these observations imply very small primordial density perturbations at such large length scales , characterized by the power @xmath4 .    however , it is possible that the primordial density perturbations become much larger at smaller length scales , beyond the range probed by cosmological observations .",
    "indeed , it is conceivable that these perturbations are so large that overdense regions collapse to form primordial black holes ( pbhs ) just after the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "they are called `` primordial '' since they do not originate from the gravitational collapse of burnt  out stars ; they could thus have any mass , including masses well below or well above stellar masses . here",
    "we assume that the fluctuations which sourced the pbhs are also generated during inflation , specifically towards the end of inflation , well after the length scales probed by conventional cosmological observations exited the horizon .",
    "there are various constraints on pbh formation .",
    "for example , the density of roughly stellar mass black holes has to satisfy limits from searches for microlensing .",
    "very light black holes could have evaporated ( via hawking radiation ) in the epoch of big bang nucleosynthesis , altering the predicted isotope abundances .",
    "these and other constraints have recently been compiled in @xcite .",
    "they can be translated into upper limits on the amplitude of the power spectrum at the length scales relevant for pbh formation , typically @xmath5 with some scale dependence .",
    "clearly the power spectrum has to change dramatically towards the end of inflation for pbh formation to occur . in the framework of standard slow ",
    "roll inflation , this implies that the slow  roll parameters , and hence the inflaton potential , also should show large variations .",
    "one simple , and yet well motivated , model that can feature large variations of the slow  roll parameters is the running - mass model @xcite , a type of inflationary model which emerges naturally in the context of supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "the model is of the single  field type , but nevertheless it has relatively strong scale  dependence ( running ) of the spectral index .",
    "previous studies of this model @xcite showed that it can indeed accommodate sufficiently large positive running of the spectral index to allow for pbh formation .",
    "however , the recent 7year wmap data @xcite prefer _ negative _ running of the spectral index .    in this paper",
    "we therefore revisit the running mass model .",
    "we expand on refs.@xcite by including the running of the running of the spectral index , which is only weakly constrained by existing cmb data .",
    "similarly , we include the running of the running of the inflaton mass parameter in the potential .",
    "we show that for some ( small ) range of parameters , this model can still accommodate sufficiently large density perturbations near the end of inflation to allow for the formation of pbhs with mass larger than @xmath6 g , which are sufficiently long  lived to be candidates for cold dark matter ( cdm ) . as a by  product we show that even with the additional term in the potential , the model does not allow for significant _ negative _ running of the spectral index .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the formalism of pbh formation . in section 3",
    "we discuss the running  mass inflation model , including the running of the running of the mass .",
    "we compute the slow  roll parameters which allow us to determine the spectral index , its running , and the running of the running . in section 4",
    "we perform a numerical analysis where we compute the spectral index at pbh scales exactly , by numerically solving the equation of motion of the inflaton field .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 5 .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    pbhs may have formed during the very early universe , and if so can have observational implications at the present epoch , e.g. from effects of their hawking evaporation @xcite for masses @xmath7 g , or by contributing to the present `` cold '' dark matter density if they are more massive than @xmath6 g @xcite .",

    "we will show that in practice @xmath10 is such a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath11 above @xmath13 that the upper cutoff is not important .",

    "however , a small positive value of @xmath223 would imply insufficient amount of inflation after the scale @xmath222 crossed the horizon . in our numerical work",
    "we therefore exclude scenarios with @xmath224 , i.e. we ( rather conservatively ) demand that at least 50 e  folds of inflation can occur after @xmath222 crossed out of the horizon .",
    "a second consistency condition we impose is that @xmath225 should not become too large . specifically , we require @xmath226 for all scales between @xmath222 and the pbh scale",

    "recall from our discussion of eq.([nsofn ] ) that @xmath59 will generally be larger than @xmath73 at the pbh scale , but the difference between the two depends on the model parameters .",
    "for very small values of @xmath265 , @xmath238 becomes very large ; this region of parameter space is therefore somewhat pathological . for sizably positive @xmath237 ,",

    "we instead have @xmath271 , i.e. the inflaton rolls away from a maximum of the potential .",
    "in fact , this latter situation also describes the branch of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] giving the largest spectral index at the pbh scale ; since here @xmath267 , @xmath225 increases during inflation on this branch .",

    "the left frame shows that the ( inverse ) scale @xmath56 first increases quickly as @xmath124 rolls down from its initial value @xmath272 .",
    "this means that @xmath124 initially moves rather slowly , as can also be seen in the right frame . since @xmath273 , the effective spectral index increases with increasing @xmath56",
    "the right frame shows that this evolution is quite nonlinear , although for @xmath274 , @xmath227 is to good approximation a parabolic function of @xmath275 .",
    "however , for even smaller scales , i.e. larger @xmath56 , the rate of growth of @xmath59 decreases again , such that @xmath232 reaches a value very close to @xmath81 at the scale @xmath276 relevant for the formation of pbhs with @xmath105 g. recall that we only allow solutions where @xmath233 for the entire range of @xmath56 considered ; figures  [ fig : fig4 ] therefore illustrate our earlier statement that this constraint limits the size of the spectral index at pbh scales .",
    "the left frame of figure  [ fig : fig4 ] shows that the inflaton potential as written becomes unbounded from below for @xmath277 .",
    "this can be cured by introducing a quartic ( or higher ) term in the inflaton potential ; the coefficient of this term should be chosen sufficiently small not to affect the discussion at the values of @xmath124 of interest to us .",
    "note also that this pathology of our inflaton potential is not visible in the right frame , since assuming @xmath278 at @xmath279 , the inflaton field can never have been larger than @xmath154 : as noted above , it can not have moved across the maximum of the potential .",

    "the choice @xmath289 allows less than 50 e  folds of inflation after @xmath222 exited the horizon .",

    "this in turn allows for less running of the spectral index . in order to check whether even heavier pbhs might be formed during the slow",
    "roll phase of running mass inflation , one therefore has to re  optimize the parameters for different choices of @xmath293 .     that allows the formation of primordial black holes of a given mass as a result of density perturbations produced during the slow ",

    "the result of such an analysis is shown in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] .",

    "roll phase of inflation if @xmath113 is more than one standard deviation above its central value .",
    "if @xmath113 is at the upper end of its present @xmath241 range , pbhs with mass up to @xmath294 g could have formed as result of density perturbations created at the end of slow ",
    "roll inflation .",
    "these results are again insensitive to the value of @xmath112 .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    in this paper we have investigated the formation of primordial black holes in the radiation  dominated era just after inflation .",
    "we have focused on density perturbations originating from the slow ",
    "roll phase of inflation . in section  2",
    "we reviewed the press ",
    "schechter type formalism for pbh formation .",
    "we found that the formation of pbhs with mass larger than @xmath6 g , which could form ( part of ) the cold dark matter in the universe , the spectral index at scale @xmath293 should be at least @xmath295 , even for the lower value of @xmath296 for the threshold @xmath297 . this value is higher that the value @xmath298 found in @xcite because here we have assumed that the mass of the collapsed region to form pbh is only 20% of the entire energy density inside the particle horizon .",
    "this spectral index is much above the value measured in the cmb .",
    "pbh formation therefore requires significant positive running of the spectral index when @xmath56 is increased .",
    "in contrast , current observations favor a negative first derivative of the spectral index . for the central value @xmath247 , where @xmath222 is the cmb pivot scale , the first derivative @xmath113 would need to exceed @xmath299 if it alone were responsible for the required increase of the spectral index ;",
    "this is outside the current @xmath300 range for this quantity .",
    "however , the second derivative ( the `` running of the running '' ) is currently only very weakly constrained .",
    "we showed in a model ",
    "independent analysis that this easily allows values of @xmath235 large enough for pbh formation , even if the first derivative of the spectral index is negative at cmb scales .    in section  3",
    "we applied this formalism to the `` running  mass '' model of inflation , which had previously been shown to allow sufficiently large positive running of the spectral index to yield pbh formation .",
    "in contrast to previous analyses , we included a term quadratic in the logarithm of the field , i.e. we included the `` running of the running '' of the inflaton mass along with the `` running of the running '' of the spectral index .",
    "we showed that this model can accommodate a sizably positive second derivative of the spectral index at pbh scales .",
    "however , this is only possible if the first derivative is also positive and sizable .",
    "in fact , like most inflationary scenarios with a smooth potential @xcite the model does not permit large negative running of the spectral index at cmb scales .",
    "current data prefere negative running of the spectral index at cmb scales , but are consistent with sufficiently large positive running at the @xmath206 level .",
    "moreover , we saw that a quadratic ( in @xmath301 ) extrapolation of the spectral index to pbh scales is not reliable , and therefore computed the spectral index exactly . imposing several consistency conditions",
    ", we found that density perturbations that are sufficiently large to trigger pbh formation only occur for a very narrow region of parameter space . among other things ,",
    "the signs of the parameters of the inflaton potential must be chosen such that the potential has a local maximum , and the initial value of the field must be slightly ( by typically less than one e  fold ) below this maximum .",
    "we emphasize that obtaining sufficiently large density perturbations at small scales is only a necessary condition for successful pbh formation",
    ". one major challenge of this model is that for parameters allowing pbh formation the spectral index keep increasing at yet smaller scales .",
    "parameters that lead to the formation of many pbhs with mass around @xmath6 g , which could form the dark matter in the universe , would predict the over  production of unstable pbhs , in conflict with data e.g. from the non  observation of black hole evaporation and ( for yet smaller masses ) big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "this problem seems quite generic for this mechanism .",
    "one way to solve it might be to abruptly cut off inflation just after the scales relevant for the formation of the desired pbhs leave the horizon , which could e.g. be achieved by triggering the waterfall field in hybrid inflation .",
    "however , this is somewhat in conflict with the use of the slow ",
    "roll formalism of structure formation , which is usually assumed to require a few more e  folds of inflation after the scales of interest left the horizon.moreover , a sharpe end of inflation means that the visible universe only inflated by about @xmath302 e  folds ; this solves the horizlatness problems only if the reheat temperature was rather low @xcite .",
    "we can therefore not state with confidence that formation of pbhs as dark matter candidates is possible in running ",
    "mass inflation ; all we can say is that certain necessary conditions can be satisfied . even that is possible only for a very limited range of parameters .",
    "this also means that constraints from the over  production of pbhs only rule out a small fraction of the otherwise allowed parameter space of this model .",
