    "understanding transport properties of molecular crystals based on hydrocarbon molecules is relevant not only to fundamental condensed matter physics , but also for applications in nanoelectronics .",
    "for instance , organic field - effect transistors are appealing as they are flexible , lightweight and cheap .",
    "rubrene - based field effect transistors @xcite display tunable mobilities that can be as large as 40 @xmath4/(v @xmath5 s ) .",
    "more recently it was shown that picene field - effect transistors@xcite based on liquid electrolytes have p - channel characteristics@xcite , although with much reduced mobilities with respect to rubrene .",
    "transport properties of organic molecular crystals can also be tuned by intercalation of alkali or alkaline earth metals .",
    "k intercalation leads to metallic states in phthalocyanine materials @xcite and in several other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . in picene@xcite , phenanthrene@xcite , coronene@xcite , and in 1,2:8,9-dibenzopentacene@xcite",
    ", intercalation stabilizes a superconducting state with critical temperatures ( t@xmath6 ) up to 33 k. a detailed understanding of transport phenomena in such systems is then relevant also for the realm of fundamental research .",
    "an important source of intrinsic scattering in aromatic molecular crystals is provided by the electron - phonon coupling . in these systems",
    "there is an interplay between intramolecular local interactions and intermolecular non - local interactions . determining the mutual role of local and non - local interactions is hardly doable without a proper theoretical approach .",
    "molecular crystals can indeed behave very differently depending on the details of the molecules composing the crystal and on their arrangement . in alkali doped fullerenes@xcite , superconductivity is supposed to be mostly due to intramolecular phonons . in this case , if the electronic states coupled to the phonons are molecular and the metallic screening is weak , then the problem can be tackled at a molecular level by the calculation of electron - phonon interaction @xcite on an isolated ionized molecule .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the field of hydrocarbon molecular crystals . in the case of 3picene ,",
    "molecular calculations @xcite using the b3lyp functional give a large electron - phonon coupling , that can almost alone explain t@xmath6",
    ". however , the generalization of this approach to other hydrocarbon molecular crystals predicts a decrease of the critical temperature with the increase of the molecular size , in disagreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "indeed in experiment the largest t@xmath6 is for the crystal composed by the largest molecules .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite performed a density functional theory calculations(dft ) in which the crystal structure of pristine picene was adopted and k - doping was treated in a rigid doping approach .",
    "the screening of the self - consistent potential was assumed to be that of insulating picene .",
    "a very large electron - phonon coupling was found mostly due to intramolecular phonons , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "in our previous work @xcite we performed dft calculations relying on less approximations then in ref .  .",
    "the theoretically devised crystal structure of 3picene was considered @xcite and k - atoms were explicitly included in the calculation .",
    "furthermore we included the metallic screening of crystalline 3picene in the self - consistent potential . by projecting the phonon polarizations into intramolecular and intermolecular vibrations , we found that 3picene has a strong electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath7 ) that is partially due to the coupling to intermolecular and intercalant phonons ( @xmath8 ) and partially to the coupling to intramolecular phonons ( @xmath9 ) , in disagreement with refs .  .",
    "in our present work , we go beyond what we have done in ref .  . instead of analyzing the `` locality '' of the electron - phonon coupling in terms of phonon projections only",
    ", we study it also by means of electronic projections onto a molecular basis , which allows one to distinguish between the on - site electronic hamiltonian and the hopping parts , both modulated by the coupling with phonons .",
    "this approach leads to a stricter distinction between purely molecular and crystal contributions , and yields a further reduction of the purely molecular component , estimated to be about @xmath0 of the total @xmath1 .",
    "the three approaches illustrated above , namely molecular calculations , rigid doping of the crystal , and explicit treatment of the dopants , rely on different approximations that could explain the discrepancies .",
    "an important one is the treatment of the electronic screening and its effects on the electron - phonon interaction . in molecular calculations @xcite and in ref .  , metallic screening is neglected .",
    "analogy with alkali doped fullerenes points out , however , that this assumption is not necessary fulfilled . in k@xmath10c@xmath11 , it has been suggested that metallic screening strongly affects the electron - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "for example , a@xmath12 modes causing a shift without splitting of the t@xmath13 c@xmath11 molecular levels , are supposed to be screened by the charge transfer from up - shifted to down - shifted levels@xcite , i. e. by the metallic screening in the solid . in 3picene",
    "the situation could be similar .",
    "however , the relative contribution of intramolecular , intermolecular and intercalant interactions remains unclear , and largely unexplored . in this work",
    "we carry out a detailed and quantitative analysis of the total electron - phonon coupling @xmath1 in 3picene , by addressing these issues .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ definition ] we provide the general definition of local and non - local electron - phonon couplings for a molecular crystal . in sec .",

    "[ local ] electron - phonon calculations are carried out by discriminating between local and non - local couplings .",
    "we find that the purely local contributions account for only @xmath0 of the full @xmath1 , while the remaining part comes from non - local sources .",
    "sec  [ mol_screening ] analyzes the screening acting on the local electron - phonon terms by a direct comparison between the crystal and the isolated ( unscreened ) molecule .",
    "we show that the effect of the metallic screening provided by the crystal environment to the deformation potential is sizable with a strong reduction of the local electron - phonon coupling with respect to the corresponding strength found in the neutral isolated molecule . in sec .",
    "[ dimg ] we look for the most important non - local terms contributing to the total @xmath1 and we build a model hamiltonian with few non - local electron - phonon couplings added to the local part which gives @xmath3 of the total @xmath1 .",
    "the conclusions are in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "we suppose that the band structure of a molecular crystal is described by the electronic tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath14 written in a basis set built out of molecular orbitals @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the index of the molecular site having its center of mass located at the equilibrium position @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the orbital index , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 satisfying canonical anticommutation relations . for simplicity , we assume here that there is only one molecule per unit cell , so the vectors @xmath17 define also the bravais lattice .",
    "@xmath14 reads then as @xmath21 where we omitted the spin index by implicitly assuming that the spin up and spin down components are equivalent , namely there is no spin symmetry breaking .",
    "the hopping matrix is defined as : @xmath22 where we exploit the lattice translational invariance .    in second quantization",
    "a phonon displacement @xmath23 of atom @xmath24 with mass @xmath25 relative to the i - th molecule is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of phonon momentum points describing the system , @xmath28 is the phonon dispersion of mode @xmath29 at a given momentum @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the 3-dimensional @xmath24-atomic component of the phonon eigenvector @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the position of the atom @xmath24 in the unit cell . the operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 satisfy canonical bosonic commutation relations .",
    "the harmonic phonon hamiltonian @xmath36 reads as : @xmath37    the complete hamiltonian for the electron - phonon ( el - phon ) problem includes electron - phonon coupling terms , and is written as @xmath38 where the local electron - phonon coupling is @xmath39 while the non - local coupling @xmath40 is @xmath41 the phase @xmath42 makes the total momentum conserved in the electron - phonon scattering terms .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling strength projected on the molecular orbitals is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath16,@xmath44 are indexes of molecular sites , @xmath45 is the fourier transform of the phonon displacement @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the ( screened ) deformation potential .    from eq .  [ local_coupling ]",
    ", it is apparent that the local coupling is a holstein - type interaction which couples the phonons with on - site molecular electronic terms , while in eq .",
    "[ non_local_coupling ] the non - local couplings modulate the hoppings @xmath48 in @xmath14 via the bosonic fields @xmath49 and @xmath35 . the local and non - local coupling strengths are proportional to the deformation potential expressed in the molecular orbital basis , centered on either the same site or two different molecules , respectively . by translational invariance , the strength depends only on the vector @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this context the definition of `` local '' and `` non - local '' couplings is purely electronic . in our previous work@xcite",
    ", we distinguished between the `` intermolecular '' and `` intramolecular '' contributions based on the phonon projections .",
    "the intramolecular phonons are those having @xmath51 projected on the single molecule manyfold , while the intermolecular phonons are those having @xmath51 spanned by the rigid molecular rototranslations together with all intercalant displacements .",
    "therefore , one can expand the bosonic fields @xmath35 into @xmath52 , being the sum of intermolecular and intramolecular projections a resolution of the identity .",
    "we thus note that cross - contributions like intramolecular phonons in non - local couplings or intermolecular phonons in local couplings , are possible .",
    "projection of both the electronic and phononic parts guarantees the isolation of the single molecule contribution . in this work",
    ", we are going to use the words `` local '' and `` non - local couplings '' to mean the electronic molecular basis set projections as in eqs .  [ local_coupling ] and [ non_local_coupling ] , respectively , while we keep the notation of ref .   by using `` intramolecular '' and `` intermolecular phonons '' to refer to the phonon projections .",
    "the molecules in the 3picene crystal are arranged to satisfy the @xmath53 symmetry group .",
    "the unit cell contains two molecules and is monoclinic with axes @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57,@xmath58,@xmath59 .",
    "the unit cell parameters have been taken from the experiment@xcite , while the internal coordinates have been optimized after a full geometry relaxation performed in a dft framework within the local density approximation ( lda ) ( for more details see the supplementary materials section of ref . ) .",
    "the final structure is drawn in fig .",
    "[ layered_structure ] , where we plot the orthogonal projections of the unit cell repeated twice in each crystallographic direction . from figs .",

    "the intercalant occupies the interstitial space and tunes the intermolecular angles by steric effect .        in order to understand the interplay between the 3picene geometry and its band structure",
    ", we are going to derive a tight - binding model constructed on a wannier function basis .",
    "the maximally localized wannier representation of the dft orbitals is useful not only to implement an interpolation scheme for computing the band structure and the electron - phonon matrix elements , but also to have a physical insight on the system .",
    "for example , the formation of the chemical bond in a solid can be visualized by means of the wannier representation of the molecular orbitals ( mos ) . in a molecular crystal , as the picene",
    ", the wannier representation is even more natural , as it builds on the local nature of molecular sites , where the mos are strongly localized .",
    "the spatial local representation given by the wannier transformation helps in modeling the electronic structure of the k - doped picene , and understanding the mechanism which sets the superconductivity .    by following ref .",

    "\\label{spread_wannier}\\ ] ] note that in this case there are two molecules per unit cell , and so the bravais vectors @xmath65 are not the centers of each molecule , at variance with the simplest case taken into account in sec .",
    "[ definition ] . in the 3picene",
    ", the mlwfs have been determined for the bands derived from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , lumo+1 , and lumo+2 of the neutral picene molecule .",
    "those bands form a quasi - composite group , as the lumo is well separated from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) .",
    "the homo - lumo gap in the pristine picene is 3 ev large@xcite , and only the lumo+2 is weakly entangled with the upper bands .",
    "therefore , a preliminary disentanglement procedure has been performed@xcite , before @xmath67 could be obtained .",
    "thus , in our case @xmath67 is a @xmath69 matrix ( 3 bands per molecule , 2 molecules per unit cell ) , and a tight - binding hamiltonian can be defined in the rotated mlwf basis , according to the matrix elements @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the one - body lda hamiltonian .    in molecular crystals , the mlwf is not necessarily the best basis to work with .",
    "the most `` physical '' basis is the one which diagonalizes the local part ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 running on the same molecule ) of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ h_wannier ] . indeed , the local part of @xmath71 represents the molecule in the crystal , and its eigenvectors @xmath74 and eigenvalues @xmath75 are respectively the mos and molecular levels in the crystal environment . from here on , we define @xmath76 to be the `` molecular '' mlwfs , where @xmath77 , with @xmath78 being the unitary transformation which diagonalizes the local problem in the mlwf basis .",
    "the molecular mlwfs @xmath79 obtained in the rigorous wannier function formalism play the role of the molecular orbitals @xmath80 generically introduced in sec .",
    "[ definition ] .        in order to see how the crystal environment affects the local mos , in fig .",
    "[ wannier_orbitals ] we plotted the local molecular mlwf functions @xmath81 of 3picene together with the mos of the isolated neutral molecule ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath81 in the doped crystal are a good representation of the orbitals in the isolated neutral picene .",
    "indeed , the lumo and lumo+1 are in close agreement .",
    "the lumo+2 differs only slightly , as in the crystal it is more `` delocalized '' , something expected as in the molecular calculations its energy level is close to the free particle continuum , and therefore it is more affected by the environment .",
    "the overall agreement allows one to make a one - to - one correspondence between the molecular properties and the crystal local on - site properties expressed in the molecular mlwf .",
    "we now analyze the hopping terms in eq .",
    "[ h_wannier ] .",
    "they show a clear hierarchy in magnitude depending on their spatial direction .",
    "the largest are the nearest neighbors ( nn ) hoppings which connect the molecules within the herringbone layer . in the herringbone structure",
    ", each molecule is linked to its four nearest neighbors in two different ways , by the proximity of either a two - ring molecular side , or a three - ring side ( see fig .  [ graph_structure](a ) ) .",
    "we found that there is a large asymmetry between the nn hoppings connecting two molecules via a three - ring molecular side , dubbed `` 1d nn '' in the text , and the ones whose connection is bridged by a two - ring side , dubbed `` 2d nn '' . the 1d nn terms , sized up to 0.09 ev , are almost twice larger than the 2d nn hoppings , which reach 0.05 ev at most .",
    "this is due to the internal degrees of freedom of the single crystal site , as the picene has an aromatic 5-ring structure .",
    "if the molecule were symmetric , the 1d and 2d nn hopping terms would be equal .",
    "the consequences of this internal asymmetry will be studied later in both the band structure and the electron - phonon couplings .        not only the nn but also the next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) hoppings are not symmetric .",
    "indeed , the nnn terms pointing along the @xmath83 crystallographic axis ( named `` 1d nnn '' in the text ) are more than twice larger than the ones pointing along the @xmath84 crystallographic axis ( dubbed `` 2d nnn '' ) , which do not go beyond 0.02 ev .",
    "this can be easily explained by noting that the @xmath83 axis is shorter than the @xmath84 axis , thus in the @xmath83 direction the molecules are more closely packed , with an increase of the transfer integrals and so of the hoppings .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ graph_structure](b ) for the graphical representation of all the nn and nnn hoppings in the herringbone plane .",
    "it turns out that the 1d nnn and the 2d nn terms are of the same magnitude ( @xmath85 0.05 ev ) .",
    "the combination of 1d nn and 1d nnn hoppings only , creates ladder chains spanning the @xmath83 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ graph_structure](c ) ) , while in a four hopping model ( with the addition of the 2d nn and the 2d nnn terms ) , their combination spans the full 2d space .",
    "the 2-ring versus 3-ring asymmetry clearly favors a `` nematic '' one dimensional electronic structure with respect to the full bidimensional layer .",
    "therefore we define a `` 1d model '' comprising of the 0d ( on - site ) , 1d nn and 1d nnn terms , and a `` 2d model '' which includes all terms of the `` 1d model '' plus the 2d nn and 2d nnn hoppings .    to understand the impact of this hierarchy on the band structure we take the hoppings of the tight - binding hamiltonian written in the mlwf basis , and we are going to selectively switch them on and off . the full band structure is plotted in fig .",
    "[ band_structure](d ) for the lumo , lumo+1 , and lumo+2 states , which yield 2 bands each . by keeping only the local on - site terms",
    ", we obtain the molecular levels @xmath75 in the crystal , which of course are dispersionless ( fig .",
    "[ band_structure](a ) ) . by switching on the 1d nn and the 1d nnn hoppings along the molecular `` wire '' , one gets the band structure of the 1d model in fig .",
    "[ band_structure](b ) .",
    "the dispersion develops only along the b - axis , but it gives the main contribution to the full 3d bandwidth , while the double degeneracy along the cy path is due to the @xmath53 symmetry .",
    "the full band structure can be roughly modeled by the 1d model , except that the fermi surface is poorly reproduced . for the 2d model ( see fig .",
    "[ layered_structure](b ) ) , a band structure closer to the 3d one is obtained , with the lumo bands almost perfectly reproduced , and the flatness of the bd and cy paths due to the decoupling in the layer stacking .",

    "only the `` on - site '' hoppings have been retained , while in the right - lower panel the band structure has been obtained with the full tight - binding model .",
    "the upper - right ( the lower - left ) panel is the result of a tight - binding model with only 1d ( 1d+2d ) nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor hoppings .",
    "the zero of the energy axis is the fermi level . ]    in the spirit of downfolding the full electronic structure to a low - energy lattice model , one interesting question is whether a two - orbital model is enough to reproduce the low - energy physics . to this aim",
    ", we suppressed the lumo+2 orbital from the tight - binding model . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ band_structure_nolumo2 ] .",
    "as one can see , the lumo+1 bands are strongly deformed , and the fermi surface is strongly modified . to have a correct description of the low - energy physics of the crystal",
    ", one needs also to include the lumo+2 molecular orbital .",

    "one can model the system by _ few _ non - local electron - phonon couplings ( eq .  [ non_local_coupling ] ) added to the local holstein - like terms ( eq .

    "this opens the way toward an efficient and reliable lattice modelization of the system , where more sophisticated many - body techniques can be used to deal with the electronic correlation and electron - phonon coupling together .",
    "it is striking that the main contribution to the coupling ( more than 50@xmath157 ) comes from the phonon modulated hoppings in the @xmath83 crystallographic direction .",
    "it means that the electron - phonon coupling is strongly anisotropic along molecular chains .",
    "based on the molecular arrangement of the crystal and on the band structure , one would have instead expected a planar anisotropy , as the system is layered , with planes oriented in the @xmath84-@xmath83 directions . on the contrary",

    "the 1d anisotropy is a consequence of the asymmetry of the picene armchair structure , as already shown in sec .",
    "[ wannier ] .    in order to generalize this argument to the experimental situations and other superconducting aromatic crystals , caution",
    "must be taken in view of the importance of the arrangement of the molecules , and of disorder .",

    "in this paper we went beyond what we have done in ref .  , where we carried out a detailed analysis of the electron - phonon coupling based on the phonon projection to intramolecular and intermolecular eigenmodes . here",
    ", thanks to the maximally localized wannier functions formalism , we took into account also the electronic projection of the deformation potential into local ( holstein - like ) and non - local couplings , defined based on a molecular orbital representation .",
    "we found that the purely molecular contribution ( projected in both the deformation potential and phonon eigenmodes ) is very weak .",
    "it accounts for only @xmath0 of the total @xmath1 ( in the adiabatic coupling formulation of eq .  [ elphon_allen ] ) .",
    "it is therefore impossible to predict the total coupling of 3picene with isolated molecular calculations only .",
    "we understood this as an effect of the metallic screening which mainly reduces the deformation potential matrix elements .",
    "this turns out from a direct comparison of the projected local coupling in the crystal with the full coupling in the isolated molecule , carried out within the same theoretical framework .",
    "moreover , we demonstrated that while @xmath2 of the electron - phonon coupling in 3picene is non - local , more than @xmath9 of @xmath1 comes just from _ two _ terms , i.e. the 1d nearest neighbors ( nn ) and the 1d next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) phonon - modulated hoppings , which form ladder chains along the @xmath83 crystallographic axis of the compound .",
    "the strong spatial @xmath183 anisotropy of the electron - phonon coupling is another interesting outcome of the present work . the intermolecular modes couple more strongly with the electrons along chains of molecules , arranged in an ordered array of ladders .",
