    "charmless hadronic @xmath7-meson decays provide a fertile ground for testing the standard model ( sm ) and exploring the source of @xmath24 violation , which attract much attention in the past years .",
    "thanks to the fruitful accomplishment of babar and belle , the constraints on the sides and interior angles of the unitarity triangle significantly reduce the allowed ranges of some of the ckm elements , and many rare @xmath7 decays are well measured . with the successful running of lhc and the advent of belle",
    "ii at superkekb , heavy flavour physics has entered a new exciting era and more @xmath7 decay modes will be measured precisely soon .",
    "recently , the evidence of pure annihilation decays @xmath25",
    "@xmath9 @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath9 @xmath28 are firstly reported by cdf collaboration @xcite , and soon confirmed by lhcb collaboration @xcite .",
    "the heavy flavor averaging group ( hfag ) presents their branching ratios @xcite @xmath29 @xmath30 such results , if confirmed , imply unexpectedly large annihilation contributions in @xmath7 decays and significant flavour symmetry breaking effects between the annihilation amplitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath31 decays , which attract much attention recently , for instance refs .",
    "@xcite .    theoretically , as noticed already in refs .",
    "@xcite , even though the annihilation contributions are formally @xmath32 power suppressed , they are very important and indispensable for charmless @xmath7 decays . by introducing the parton transverse momentum and the sudakov factor to regulate the endpoint divergence",
    ", there is a large complex annihilation contribution within the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite . the latest renewed pqcd estimations",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath34 @xmath37 @xcite give an appropriate account of the cdf and lhcb measurements within uncertainties .",
    "in the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) framework @xcite , the endpoint divergence in annihilation amplitudes is usually parameterized by @xmath38 ( see eq.([xa ] ) ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath40 @xmath43 ( scenario s4 ) @xcite are adopted conservatively in evaluating the amplitudes of @xmath7 @xmath1 @xmath44 decays , which lead to the predictions @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath45 and @xmath36 @xmath34 @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the qcdf prediction of @xmath36 agrees well with the data eq.([hfagkk ] ) , but the one of @xmath33 is much smaller than the present experimental measurement eq.([hfagpipi ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy kindles the passions of restudy on annihilation contributions @xcite .    at present , there are two major issues among the well - concerning focus on the annihilation contributions within the qcdf framework , one is whether @xmath47 is universal for @xmath7 decays , and the other is what its value should be . as to the first issue , there is no an imperative reason for the annihilation parameters @xmath39 and @xmath42 to be the same for different @xmath48 decays , even for different annihilation topologies , although they were usually taken to be universal in the previous numerical calculation for simplicity @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , it is almost impossible to account for all of the well - measured two - body charmless @xmath7 decays with the universal values of @xmath39 and @xmath42 based on the qcdf approach @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pqcd study on @xmath7 meson decays also indicate that the annihilation parameters @xmath39 and @xmath42 should be process - dependent .",
    "in fact , in the practical qcdf application to the @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath44 , @xmath49 decays ( where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the light pseudoscalar and vector @xmath52 meson nonet , respectively ) , the non - universal values of annihilation phase @xmath42 with respect to pp and pv final states are favored ( scenario s4 ) @xcite ; the process - dependent values of @xmath39 and @xmath42 are given based on an educated guess @xcite or the comparison with the updated measurements @xcite ; the flavour - dependent values of @xmath39 and @xmath42 are suggested recently in the nonfactorizable annihilation contributions @xcite . in principle",
    "the value of @xmath39 and @xmath42 should differ from each other for different topologies with different flavours , but we hope that the qcdf approach can accommodate and predict much more hadronic @xmath7 decays with less input parameters .",
    "so much attention in phenomenological analysis on the weak annihilation @xmath7 decays is devoted to what the appropriate values of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath42 should be .",
    "this is the second issue . in principle",
    ", a large value of @xmath39 is unexpected by the power counting rules and the self - consistency validation within the qcdf framework .",
    "the original proposal is that @xmath39 @xmath53 @xmath41 and an arbitrary strong interaction phase @xmath42 are universal for all decay processes , and that a fine - tuning of the phase @xmath42 is required to be reconciled with experimental data when @xmath39 is significantly larger than 1 @xcite .",
    "the recent study on the annihilation contributions show that @xmath39 @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 are acceptable , even necessary , to reproduce the data for some two - body nonleptonic @xmath48 decay modes @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will perform a fitting on the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath42 by considering @xmath7 @xmath9 @xmath6 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 decay modes , on one hand , to investigate the strength of annihilation contribution , on the other hand , to study their effects on the anomalies in @xmath7 physics , such as the well - known @xmath5 and @xmath6 puzzles .",
    "the so - called @xmath5 puzzle is reflected by the difference between the direct @xmath24 asymmetries for @xmath59 @xmath9 @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xmath9 @xmath62 decays . with the up - to - date hfag results @xcite",
    ", we get @xmath63 which differs from zero by about @xmath64 .",

    "@xmath34 @xmath75 @xcite is unexpectedly large .",
    "it is claimed @xcite that the so - called @xmath6 puzzle could be accommodated by the nonfactorizable contributions in sm .",
    "it is argued @xcite that to solve the so - called @xmath5 puzzle , a large complex color - suppressed tree amplitude @xmath79 or a large complex electroweak penguin contribution @xmath80 or a combination of them are essential .",
    "an enhanced complex @xmath80 with a nontrivial strong phase can be obtained from new physics effects @xcite . to get a large complex @xmath79",
    ", one can resort to spectator scattering and final state interactions @xcite .",
    "recently , the annihilation amplitudes with large parameters @xmath39 is suggested to conciliate the recent measurements eq.([hfagpipi ] ) and eq.([hfagkk ] ) , so surprisingly , the @xmath5 puzzle is also resolved simultaneously @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the power corrections , such as spectator scattering at the twist-3 order and annihilation amplitudes , are important to account for the large branching ratios and @xmath24 asymmetries of penguin - dominated and/or color - suppressed tree - dominated @xmath7 decays .",
    "so , before claiming a new physics signal , it is essential to examine whether power corrections could retrieve `` problematic '' deviations from the sm expectations .",
    "interestingly , our study show that with appropriate parameters , the annihilation and spectator scattering contributions could provide some possible solutions to the @xmath23 and @xmath10 puzzles .",

    "( 1 ) for factorizable annihilation topologies , i.e. , the gluon emission from the final states fig.[diag](c , d ) , the flavor symmetry breaking effects are embodied in the decay constants , because the asymptotic light - cone distribution amplitudes of final states are the same .",
    "in addition , all decay constants have been factorized outside from the hadronic matrix elements of factorizable annihilation topologies .",
    "so @xmath109 is independent of the initial state , and is the same for @xmath48 annihilation decays to two light pseudoscalar mesons , that is to say , @xmath110 and @xmath111 should be universal for @xmath48 @xmath1 @xmath44 decays .",

    "hence , @xmath113 should depend on the initial state and be different for @xmath8 from @xmath31 meosn due to flavor symmetry breaking effects , i.e. , parameters of @xmath114 and @xmath115 should be non - universal for @xmath116 and @xmath8 meson decays , and be different from parameters of @xmath110 and @xmath111 for @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , the symmetry breaking effects have been considered in pervious qcdf study on two - body hadronic @xmath7 decays @xcite , but with parameters of @xmath110 @xmath34 @xmath114 and @xmath111 @xmath34 @xmath115 .",

    "therefore , the symmetry breaking effects should also be considered for the quantity @xmath104 that is introduced to parameterize the endpoint singularity in the twist-3 level spectator scattering corrections .",
    "similar to @xmath118 , the quantity @xmath104 is related to the topologies that gluon emit from the initial @xmath7 meson .",

    "<S> the large branching ratios for pure annihilation @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath1 @xmath4 decays reported by cdf and lhcb collaborations recently and the so - called @xmath5 and @xmath6 puzzles indicate that spectator scattering and annihilation contributions are important to the penguin - dominated , color - suppressed tree dominated , and pure annihilation nonleptonic @xmath7 decays . combining the available experimental data for @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath5 and @xmath11 decays , we do a global fit on the spectator scattering and annihilation parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are used to parameterize the endpoint singularity in amplitudes of spectator scattering , nonfactorizable and factorizable annihilation topologies within the qcd factorization framework , in three scenarios for different purpose . </S>",
