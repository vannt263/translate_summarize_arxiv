    "recently considerable attention has been devoted to flux compactifications of super  string theory or of @xmath4theory , since they provide mechanisms to stabilize the moduli fields @xcite@xcite . within this context a particularly interesting class of flux compactifications",
    "is represented by those on twisted  tori @xcite .",
    "this is the contemporary understanding of the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite of mass generation from extra dimensions . as it was explained by hull and reid - edwards @xcite , twisted tori",
    "are just lie group manifolds @xmath1 modded by the action of some discrete subgroup @xmath12 which makes them compact .",
    "a general pattern only recently elucidated is the relation between fluxes and gauge algebras . upon dimensional reduction in the presence of fluxes",
    "one ends up with some lower dimensional gauged supergravity and a particularly relevant question is that about the structure of the gauge lie algebra in relation with the choice of fluxes .",
    "some years ago the authors of @xcite introduced the concept of embedding matrix and by means of it classified all the @xmath13 supergravity gaugings , originally studied in @xcite , were the electric group is taken to be @xmath14 .",
    "the very idea of _ embedding matrix _ proved to be very fertile and pivotal , yet the classification of @xcite was shown to be incomplete in @xcite by proving that the hypothesis that the electric group be @xmath15 could be relaxed . in the same papers some new explicit examples of gaugings were also explicitly constructed .",
    "later the authors of @xcite obtained an elegant characterization of the embedding matrix as a suitable irreducible representation of @xmath16 thus extending the action of the global symmetry group of the ungauged theory ( also referred to as @xmath17duality group ) to gauged supergravities .",
    "this analysis was eventually applied to gauged five  dimensional maximal supergravities in @xcite . still later , from inspection of the low  energy description of various flux compactifications ( either involving form  fluxes or `` geometrical fluxes '' , i.e. background quantities related to the geometry of the internal manifold ,",
    "like the `` twist '' tensor characterizing the twisted ",
    "tori ) , a precise statement about the relation between internal fluxes and local symmetries of the lower  dimensional effective supergravity was derived : the background quantities enter the lower  dimensional gauged supergravity as components of the embedding tensor , and thus they can be naturally assigned to representations of the @xmath17duality group @xcite ( a similar statement was made in the context of the heterotic string in @xcite ) .",
    "hence an obvious question is that relative to the gauge algebra emerging from flux compactifications on twisted tori .",
    "this question has been addressed in a recent series of papers @xcite and it has been advocated that the gauge algebraic structures emerging in @xmath18 supergravities which originate from this kind of @xmath4theory compactifications , do not fall in the class of lie algebras @xmath19 , but rather have to be understood in the more general context of free differential algebras .",
    "the algebraic structure that goes under this name was independently discovered at the beginning of the eighties in mathematics by sullivan @xcite and in physics by the authors of @xcite .",
    "free differential algebras ( fda ) are a categorical extension of the notion of lie algebra and constitute the natural mathematical environment for the description of the algebraic structure of higher dimensional supergravity theory , hence also of string theory .",
    "the reason is the ubiquitous presence in the spectrum of string / supergravity theory of antisymmetric gauge fields ( @xmath20forms ) of rank greater than one .",
    "the very existence of fda.s is a consequence of chevalley cohomology of ordinary lie algebras and sullivan has provided us with a very elegant classification scheme of these algebras based on two structural theorems rooted in the set up of such an elliptic complex .    in view of sullivan",
    "s theorems one of the present authors analyzed in @xcite the results of @xcite from the point of view of chevalley cohomology .",
    "the goal was that of establishing the structure of the minimal fda algebra @xmath21 which emerges from twisted tori compactifications and relating its _ generalized structure constants _ to the fluxes , just in the spirit of the general relation between _ gaugings _ , i.e. embedding matrices and @xmath20-form fluxes explained above .",
    "the basic notion of _ minimal algebra _ is illustrated in the following way .    as it was noted in @xcite , fda.s have the additional fascinating property that , as opposite to ordinary lie algebras , they already encompass their own gauging . indeed the first of sullivan s structural theorems , which is in some sense analogous to levi s theorem for lie algebras , states that the most general fda is a semidirect sum of a so called minimal algebra @xmath21 with a contractible one @xmath22 .",
    "the generators of the minimal algebra are physically interpreted as the connections or _",
    "potentials _ , while the contractible generators are physically interpreted as the _",
    "curvatures_. the real hard  core of the fda is the minimal algebra and it is obtained by setting the contractible generators ( the curvatures ) to zero .",
    "the structure of the minimal algebra @xmath21 , in turn , is beautifully determined by chevalley cohomology of the underlying lie algebra @xmath19 .",
    "this happens to be the content of sullivan s second structural theorem .    by rephrasing all the equations of papers @xcite in the framework of chevalley cohomology and exploiting the underlying structure of a double elliptic complex ,",
    "paper @xcite established the following result :    [ teor1 ] the minimal algebra @xmath21 emerging in twisted tori compactification of m - theory , i.e. in compactifications on a @xmath0-dimensional group manifold @xmath1 necessarily coincides with the lie algebra @xmath23 of @xmath1 unless the internal flux @xmath24 of the @xmath25-form defines a cohomologically non - trivial @xmath25-cycle of @xmath23 , namely unless @xmath26 .",
    "it was actually proven in @xcite that in order to get a minimal algebra which is a proper extension of @xmath23 on a certain background , @xmath27 is just a necessary but not yet sufficient condition .",
    "indeed it was proven the following    [ teor2 ] the necessary and sufficient condition for the minimal free differential algebra @xmath21 to be a proper extension of @xmath23 , is that the @xmath25-form @xmath28 defined by the internal @xmath25form flux should :    a : :    be cohomologically non trivial @xmath29 b : :    its triple contraction should be a non trivial @xmath30cycle .    given a basis of cycles @xmath31}$ ] for each chevalley    cohomology group @xmath32 , and the pairing    form @xmath33 , this condition is expressed by :    @xmath34 } \\",

    "this is the no - go theorem announced by our title .",
    "let us however immediately comment on the scope and bearings of our theorem .",
    "indeed , we are quite conscious that the value of any negative result resides in a clear  cut presentation of the hypotheses and conditions under which it is derived . only in this case",
    "the negative statement can be turned into a positive contribution by indicating the directions to be pursued in order to evade it .",
    "so let us immediately recall that by compactification of m - theory on a twisted torus we mean in this paper the same that was meant in @xcite and that was assumed in the series of papers @xcite , namely a bosonic configuration of the @xmath4theory light fields ( the metric @xmath41 and the three form @xmath42 ) such that the @xmath43dimensional manifold splits into the following direct product : @xmath44 @xmath45 denoting a four - dimensional maximally symmetric manifold whose coordinates we denote @xmath46 and @xmath1 a @xmath0dimensional group manifold whose parameters we denote @xmath47 . let us denote by @xmath48 the purely @xmath49-dependent left ",

    "all of these forms are assumed to live on @xmath18 space - time . from these assumptions",

    "there are three possible eleven  dimensional backgrounds of this kind : @xmath69 in any case lorentz invariance imposes eqs.([delta = phi],[nokk],[viaperlorentz ] ) while translation invariance imposes that the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields @xmath70 should be a constant matrix @xmath71 while the tensor @xmath24 should be a constant tensor as assumed in eq.([intoflux ] ) .",
    "the reason why we set @xmath72 is that any matrix @xmath73 can be reabsorbed by a change of basis of generators of the lie algebra and hence it corresponds to no new degrees of freedom .    in this paper",
    "we shall prove that there are no @xmath23 lie algebras such that eq.s ( [ maxsym]-[intoflux ] ) lead to a bona fide solution of m - theory field equations with a cohomologically non  trivial flux @xmath24 .",
    "this , in view of our previous discussion , implies the no go theorem on fda claimed above .",
    "the same result was obtained in @xcite from inspection of the scalar potential @xmath74 of the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "indeed bosonic backgrounds of the kind we are considering , correspond to extrema of @xmath74 .",
    "it was shown that the extremization of @xmath74 with resect to the axions @xmath75 implies the vanishing of the internal components @xmath76}_{ijkl}$ ] of the 4form field strength : @xmath77}_{ijkl}&= & -g_{ijkl}-\\frac{3}{2}\\tau^m{}_{[ij}c_{kl]m}=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which in turn implies that @xmath24 is cohomologically trivial .",
    "still from inspection of @xmath74 in @xcite , solutions with de sitter geometry ( @xmath78 at the minimum ) were ruled out , but no statement was made about the existence of anti  de sitter vacua . in @xcite the existence of supersymmetric anti  de sitter vacua was ruled out in a particular orientifold truncation of the maximally supersymmetric model .",
    "the output of our present analysis is two  fold : on one hand we give an alternative formal derivation of the triviality of @xmath24 , making use of the aforementioned arguments , on the other hand we show that bosonic backgrounds of anti  de sitter type ( arising from freund rubin type of compactifications ) are not solutions of the theory .",
    "it should be noted that there are two main assumptions which could be possibly relaxed leading , may be , to different conclusions :    1 .",
    "we could introduce a warp factor .",
    "this means that in eq .",
    "( [ conv1 ] ) the first line could be replaced by @xmath79 \\ , e^a(x ) \\label{warping}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is some suitable function of the internal coordinates . in this case",
    ", however , the entire analysis of eq.s ( [ 3f1 ] ) and ( [ fb1 ] ) in terms of chevalley cohomology has to be reconsidered since the internal boundary operator @xmath81 , defining such a cohomology , no longer annihilates the @xmath18 vielbeins @xmath82 .",
    "our result applies to the field equations of m - theory without sources . including the contribution of @xmath83 or @xmath84 branes one changes those equations by the addition of new terms whose bearing has to be considered .",
    "the token by means of which we shall prove our negative result is provided by the reduction of the whole problem to a question of holonomy on the considered internal manifold @xmath85 ( in our case the group manifold @xmath1 ) .",
    "indeed as we explain in detail in section [ englertspace ] a solution of m - theory field equations with a non  trivial internal flux does exist if and only if the internal @xmath0-manifold @xmath85 is a riemanian manifold of _ _ weak @xmath2 holonomy__@xcite .",
    "this is the new phrasing , in modern parlance , of the notion originally introduced at the beginning of the eighties by the authors of @xcite under the name of _ englert manifolds_.    in view of this the final question will be whether @xmath0-dimensional group manifolds of _ weak @xmath2 holonomy _ do or do not exist .",
    "compact coset manifolds @xmath86 of the englert type ( weak @xmath2 holonomy ) were all classified and studied in the golden age of kaluza klein supergravity namely at the beginning of the eighties spaces namely @xcite for @xmath87 , @xcite for the squashed @xmath87 , @xcite for the @xmath88 spaces , @xcite for @xmath89 spaces , @xcite for the @xmath90 spaces and @xcite for the exhaustive classification of the remaining ones . ] .",
    "yet group manifolds , possibly non  compact , have not been considered so far under this point of view .",
    "we shall be able to prove the :    [ nogruppo ] @xmath0-dimensional group manifolds of englert type , namely of weak @xmath2 holonomy do not exist .",
    "using the interesting results of @xcite we will reformulate the condition of weak @xmath2 holonomy in terms of the irreducible @xmath2 representation contents of the candidate structure constants @xmath91 of the lie algebra @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to a parametrization of @xmath92 in terms of @xmath93parameters .",
    "we should now impose jacobi indentities and find how many solutions survive .",
    "this turns out to be algebraically too difficult .",
    "yet we can use a different powerful argument . if a lie algebra of weak @xmath2 holonomy existed its ricci tensor @xmath94 times the definition which is traditionally adopted in the literature on general relativity , so that for instance the ricci tensor @xmath3 of a sphere is negative definite",
    ". moreover we use the `` mostly minus '' convention for the metric , so that the internal manifold has a negative definite metric . ] would be proportional to the identity matrix with a _ positive _ coefficient .",
    "we can instead prove that for all possible @xmath0-dimensional lie algebras the ricci form @xmath95 has an indefinite signature admitting at least one negative or null eigenvalue .",
    "our paper is organized as follows    in section [ englertspace ] we analyze @xmath4-theory field equations and the notion of weak @xmath2 holonomy .",
    "we show that this is identical to the notion of _ englert manifold _ introduced in the literature on kaluza klein supergravity two decades ago and we demonstrate that this is the necessary and sufficient condition in order to find solutions with an internal flux .    in section [ grupporiformulo ]",
    "we reformulate the notion of weak @xmath2 holonomy in terms of representation theory .    in section [ ricciussection ]",
    "we prove our main no - go theorem .",
    "section [ concludo ] briefly summarizes our conclusions .",
    "appendix [ g2formalismo ] contains several details on @xmath2 invariant forms , projection operators and irreducible tensors .",
    "appendix [ bappendo ] contains a classification of seven dimensional algebras with either @xmath96 or @xmath97 levi subalgebras .",
    "these classifications are utilized in the proof of our main no - go theorem .",
    "in the recent literature about flux compactifications a geometrical notion which has been extensively exploited is that of @xmath98-structures .",
    "following , for instance , the presentation of @xcite , if @xmath99 is a differentiable manifold of dimension @xmath100 , @xmath101 its tangent bundle and @xmath102 its frame bundle , we say that @xmath99 admits a @xmath98-structure when the structural group of @xmath103 is reduced from the generic @xmath104 to a proper subgroup @xmath105 .",
    "generically , tensors on @xmath99 transform in representations of the structural group @xmath104 .",
    "if a @xmath98-structure reduces this latter to @xmath106 , then the decomposition of an irreducible representation of @xmath104 , pertaining to a certain tensor @xmath107 , with respect to the subgroup @xmath98 may contain singlets .",
    "this means that on such a manifold @xmath99 there may exist a certain tensor @xmath107 which is @xmath98invariant , and therefore globally defined . as recalled in @xcite existence of a riemannian metric @xmath108 on @xmath99 is equivalent to a reduction of the structural group @xmath104 to @xmath109 , namely to an @xmath109-structure .",
    "indeed , one can reduce the frame bundle by introducing orthonormal frames , the vielbein @xmath110 , and , written in these frames , the metric is the the @xmath109 invariant tensor @xmath111 .",
    "similarly orientability corresponds to an @xmath112-structure and the existence of spinors on spin manifolds corresponds to a @xmath113-structure .    in the case of seven dimensions , an orientable riemannian manifold @xmath85",
    ", whose frame bundle has generically an @xmath114 structural group admits a @xmath2-structure if and only if , in the basis provided by the orthonormal frames @xmath110 , there exists an antisymmetric @xmath59-tensor @xmath115 satisfying the algebra of the octonionic structure constants : @xmath116 which is invariant , namely it is the same in all local trivializations of the @xmath114 frame bundle .",
    "this corresponds to the algebraic definition of @xmath2 as that subgroup of @xmath114 which acts as an automorphism group of the octonion algebra .",
    "alternatively @xmath2 can be defined as the stability subgroup of the @xmath117-dimensional spinor representation of @xmath114 .",
    "hence we can equivalently state that a manifold @xmath85 has a @xmath2-structure if there exists at least an invariant spinor @xmath118 , which is the same in all local trivializations of the @xmath119 spinor bundle .    in terms of this invariant spinor",

    "the relation between the two definitions ( [ octonioholo ] ) and ( [ covspinor ] ) of @xmath2-holonomy is the same as for the two definitions of the @xmath2-structure , namely it is given by eq.([etateta ] ) . as a consequence of its own definition a riemannian @xmath0-manifold with @xmath2 holonomy",

    "the internal ricci tensor is zero : @xmath135    next we consider the field equations of @xmath4-theory @xcite , which we write here with the notations and the conventions of @xcite @xmath136 where hatted indices run on eleven values and are flat indices .",
    "we make the compactification ansatz : @xmath137 where @xmath45 is one of the three possibilities mentioned in eq.([threepossib ] ) and all of eq.s([delta = phi]-[intoflux ] ) hold true .",
    "then we split the rigid index range as follows : @xmath138 and by following the conventions employed in @xcite and using the results obtained in the same paper , we conclude that the compactification ansatz reduces the system ( [ fresconia],[fresconib ] ) to the following one : @xmath139    recall that we use capital latin indices to label the internal coordinates .",

    "eq.s ( [ gsquare ] ) and ( [ englert ] ) , are equivalent to the assertion that the manifold @xmath85 has weak @xmath2 holonomy rather than @xmath2holonomy , to state it in modern parlance @xcite . in paper @xcite ,",
    "manifolds admitting such a structure were instead named _",
    "englert spaces _ and the underlying notion of weak @xmath2 holonomy was already introduced there with the different name of _ de sitter @xmath143 holonomy_.    indeed eq.([englert ] ) which , in the language of the early eighties was named englert equation @xcite and which is nothing else but equation ( [ fresconia ] ) , upon substitution of the freund rubin ansatz ( [ externalflux ] ) for the external flux , can be recast in the following more revealing form : let @xmath144 be a the constant @xmath25form on @xmath85 defined by our non vanishing flux , and let @xmath145 be its dual .",

    "indeed @xmath148 is the @xmath2 invariant and covariantly constant form defining @xmath2-structure and @xmath2-holonomy . on the other hand",
    "the case @xmath149 corresponds to the weak @xmath2 holonomy . just as we reduced the existence of a closed three - form @xmath148 to the existence of a @xmath2 covariantly constant spinor satisfying eq.([covspinor ] ) which allows to set the identification ( [ etateta ] ) , in the same way eq.s ( [ ollaolla ] ) can be solved _ if and only if _ on @xmath85 there exist a weak killing spinor @xmath118 satisfying the following defining condition : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a numerical constant and @xmath141 is the freund - rubin parameter , namely the only scale which at the end of the day will occur in the solution .",

    "the holonomy , in particular weak @xmath2 holonomy , is a property of the metric , so that on the same algebra @xmath23 there can be a metric @xmath220 with a certain holonomy and another one @xmath224 with a different holonomy . the crucial observation",
    ", however , is that , once the signature of @xmath220 has been fixed ( in our case the euclidean negative one ) , the choice of the metric is equivalent to a change of basis in the algebra .",
    "indeed under the latter @xmath225 , where @xmath226 is a non degenerate real matrix , the metric changes as follows : @xmath227 and by means of a suitable real @xmath73 we can always obtain @xmath228 .",
    "as it is evident from its definition ( [ riccimatrona ] ) also the ricci form changes in the same way as the metric : @xmath229 \\ , \\rightarrow \\ , { \\mathbf{ric}}[\\widetilde{\\tau } ] \\ , = \\ , \\mathcal{a}^t \\",
    ",    \\mathbf{ric}[\\tau ] \\ , \\mathcal{a } \\label{changioriccio}\\ ] ] so that , instead of considering the space of metrics on each given @xmath0dimensional lie algebra @xmath23 , it is sufficient , fixing the metric to be the standard one , ( @xmath230 @xmath231 ) , to consider all possible lie algebra bases , parametrized by the elements @xmath232 of the general linear group in @xmath0dimensions . as we have recalled in previous sections ,",
    "if the spin connection of a @xmath0manifold @xmath85 has weak @xmath2holonomy , namely if @xmath233 satisfies the defining condition ( [ alphacondo ] ) , then the intrinsic ricci tensor @xmath234 is automatically proportional to @xmath235 with a positive coefficient , namely it is a positive definite symmetric @xmath37-form .",
    "this observation provides a very severe necessary ( although not yet sufficient condition ) for weak @xmath2 holonomy : the ricci form of the candidate @xmath23 lie algebra , equipped with a negative definite metric @xmath236 should instead be positive definite @xmath237 .",
    "the value of this criterion is that it depends only on the choice of the algebra and not on the choice of the basis , or equivalently of the metric .",
    "so if we are able to prove that for all @xmath0-dimensional lie algebras the ricci form is never positive definite , then we have proved our theorem .",
    "as we anticipated , we proceed by exhaustion of all the possible cases , relying on the fundamental structural theorem by levi which states that    [ levitheorem ] any lie algebra @xmath19 of dimension @xmath238 is the semidirect product of a semisimple lie algebra @xmath239 of dimension @xmath240 , called the levi subalgebra @xmath241 with a solvable ideal @xmath242 of dimension @xmath243 so that @xmath244 .",

    "for each of these    algebras we calculate the ricci form and we show that in every case it    has indefinite signature ( both positive and non positive eigenvalues )    so that all cases are excluded .",
