    "massive stars play an important role in the evolution of the universe as the principal source of heavy elements and uv radiation and profoundly affect the physical , chemical and morphological structure of galaxies ( e.g. , zinnecker et al .",
    "2007 ) . understanding the formation of massive stars is also crucial to an improved understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "however , limited by distance , complexity , and the rapid evolution of young stars , our knowledge of the massive star formation process is still crude , in both observational and theoretical aspects .",
    "it is generally accepted that giant molecular clouds ( gmc ) are birthplace of massive stars , thus studies of gmcs are vital to our understanding of the physical and chemical conditions where massive star - formation occurs .",
    "molecular line observations could provide plenty of information about temperature , density , mass , kinematics , magnetic field and so on .",
    "molecular lines are not only important diagnostic of the chemistry and physics of molecular clouds , studies of molecular lines themselves are also of astro - chemical importance since the time dependence of the chemical composition of gmc provides potential means to infer the evolutionary timescales of those sources ( e.g. , van dishoeck 1998 ; gwenlan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "interstellar cyanoacetylene ( hc@xmath0n ) , which was discovered by turner ( 1971 ) , is an excellent dense gas tracer ( morris et al .",
    "1976 , 1977 ; chung et al . 1991 ; bergin et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this molecule belongs to an important group of interstellar molecules - the cyanopolyynes , hc@xmath3n .",
    "it has high electric dipole moments ( @xmath2 = 3.72 debye ) , thus it traces high density regions . though the abundance of hc@xmath0n  is high enough that this molecule is easily detected in many sources , the lines above j = 5 - 4 are usually optically thin , which enables us to study the inner detailed structure of molecular clouds ( chung et al .",
    "observations of the orion a gmc complex show that the [ hc@xmath0n]/[cn ] abundance ratio varies from values of @xmath4 10@xmath5 for the ionization fronts surrounding the h ii regions , to 100 for the hot core in orion , indicating that hc@xmath0n  might be easily destroyed by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons from central ionizing sources , thus the [ hc@xmath0n]/[cn ] abundance ratio is proposed to be an excellent tracer of photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ) and hot cores within regions of massive star formation ( rodriguez - franco et al . 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the fractional abundances of large massive dense cores seem to be smaller than that of low mass dense core , supporting the destruction of hc@xmath0n  by uv photons ( chung et al . 1991 ) .",
    "however , observations of a large size of star - forming regions are still needed to investigate the effect of ultraviolet ( uv ) photons on hc@xmath0n .",
    "the ethynyl radical ( c@xmath1h ) was first detected in interstellar clouds by tucker et al .",
    "it is an important molecule for probing chemical evolution of molecular clouds , since it is a crucial intermediate molecular in the interstellar chemistry leading to long chain carbon compounds ( padovani et al .",
    "c@xmath1h  is of special interest because the rotational transitions are splited into hyper - fine structure components . at 3 mm , six components with line strengths varying by over an order of magnitude",
    "could be observed , and their relative intensities could be compared extremely precisely , which allows for a precise determination of optical depth ( padovani et al .",
    "observations indicate that c@xmath1h  is almost omnipresent toward evolutionary stages from infrared dark clouds ( irdc ) via high - mass protostellar objects ( hmpo ) to ultracompact hii regions ( uchii ) ( huggins et al .",
    "1984 ; beuther et al . 2008 ; padovani et al . 2009 ; walsh et al . 2010 ) .",
    "beuther et al .",
    "( 2008 ) proposed that c@xmath1h  is abundant from the onset of massive star formation , but later it is rapidly transformed to other molecules in the core center . in the outer regions the abundance of c@xmath1h  remains high due to constant replenishment of elemental carbon from co being dissociated by the interstellar uv photons .",
    "however , only a few mapping observations have been carried out and more observations are required to study the large - scale spatial distribution and chemical evolution of c@xmath1h  in massive star - forming regions .",
    "the extensive velocity information contained in spectral line maps provides good opportunity to analyze kinematics of molecular clouds , and the presence of rotation has been found in many molecular clouds in this way ( e.g. zheng et al .",

    "( 2010 ) ; zhang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that angular momentum of rotating molecular cloud is many orders of magnitude higher than that of the stars that eventually form in this cloud ( e.g. , spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "star - formation models must account for this and several mechanisms are proposed , e.g. , magnetic braking or magnetocentrifugally driven outflows ( e.g. , weise et al .",
    "however , it is still unclear whether there is one dominant process for dispersing angular momentum during the entire star - formation process . to solve this problem",
    "it is necessary to measure kinematic structure of a large sample of molecular clouds in both small and large scales .",
    "previous studies have come primarily from observations of a single species .",
    "systematic studies with different molecular tracers are required to characterize the large scale dynamical structure of molecular clouds and to investigate the angular momentum problem of molecular clouds .",
    "hnc , one of the most commonly used dense gas tracer ( n@xmath6 cm@xmath5 ) , could be observed simultaneously with hc@xmath0n  10 - 9 within 1 ghz band .",
    "thus the hnc 1 - 0 transition was also observed to investigate the kinematic structure of molecular clouds by combining with observations of hc@xmath0n  and c@xmath1h .    in this paper we present mapping observations of hc@xmath0n , hnc and c@xmath1h  of 27 massive star - forming regions with the purple mountain observatory 13.7 m telescope .",
    "the influence of hii region on hc@xmath0n , optical depth of c@xmath1h kinematic structure and magnetic field of gmc are investigated .",

    "the uniformly magnetic sphere model appears to provide a reasonable estimate of @xmath138 as it gives the average magnetic field strength and number density .",
    "@xmath130 is calculated to be 72 times critical with the median magnetic field strength of 13 @xmath2 g , median number density of 1@xmath1910@xmath29 cm@xmath5 and median radius of 0.24 pc .",
    "this means that the molecular clouds are strongly supercritical and magnetic fields alone are insufficient to support clouds against gravity .",
    "v@xmath139zquez - semadeni et al . ( 2011 ) have recently found that clouds formed by supercritical inflow streams proceed directly to collapse , while clouds formed by subcritical streams first contract and then re - expand , oscillating on the scale of tens of myr .",
    "their simulations with initial magnetic field strength of several @xmath2 g also show that only supercritical lead to reasonable star forming rates .",
    "this result is not altered by the inclusion of ambipolar diffusion .",
    "thus we could see that both magnetic field strength and number density derived using the uniformly magnetic sphere model are not in contradiction with observations and numerical simulations , indicating possible magnetic field origin of turbulence , as is suggested by zeeman measurements of magnetic field strengths ( crutcher et al .",
    "1999 ; falgarone et al .",
    "turbulence is another important support against gravity besides magnetic field , understanding of the origin of turbulence is critical to our understanding of massive star - formation .",

    "the fwhm size , linewidth , velocity gradient , @xmath42 and @xmath48 are plotted versus galactic radius in figure [ galactrend ] .",
    "there is little evidence for any trend in velocity gradient ( r=0.13 , 0.07 and 0.26 for hc@xmath0n , hnc and c@xmath1h ) , @xmath42 ( r=-0.13 , -0.24 and 0.09 for hc@xmath0n , hnc and c@xmath1h ) .",
    "there may be weak anti - correlations of @xmath48 ( r=-0.30 , -0.26 and -0.29 for hc@xmath0n , hnc and c@xmath1h ) .",

    "we just plot fwhm linewidth and @xmath123 for hc@xmath0n  since only hc@xmath0nemission is optically thin among three molecular line emissions , thus only line profile of hc@xmath0n  avoids being affected by self - absorption .",
    "the large spike in fwhm linewidth near @xmath140 is due to observations of w51 m .",
    "these results suggest decline of turbulence and dense gas abundance toward outer galaxy .",

    "the integrated intensities of hc@xmath0n , hnc and c@xmath1h  correlate well with each other , implying abundance correlation of three species in massive star - forming regions .",
    "comparison of deconvolved fwhm sizes indicate that hc@xmath0n  traces dense gas , while c@xmath1h  trace extended gas .    the derived optical depth of c@xmath1h  main line range from 0.1 to 6.5 .",
    "obvious central depletion is observed in c@xmath1h  opacity maps , which is consistent with chemical model of c@xmath1h .",
    "abundance decline of c@xmath1h  as molecular clouds evolve is noticed , implying significant destruction of c@xmath1h  by uv photons .",
    "these results suggest that c@xmath1his a potential  chemical clock \" for molecular clouds .",
    "velocity gradients are detected in nearly all the sources , implying that rotation is a common feature of molecular clouds .",
    "the direction of velocity gradients are nearly the same for three species , and the magnitude of velocity gradients increase toward the center , implying differential rotation rather than rigid - body rotation .",
    "both the ratio of rotational energy and specific angular momentum are found to decrease toward the center for most clouds , implying effective angular momentum transfer in large scale .",
    "the angular momentum transfer is possiblly caused by magnetic braking .",
    "magnetic field strength of several @xmath2 g was obtained to regulate rotation and dominate the dynamics of molecular clouds , which is consistent with zeeman measurements of magnetic field in molecular clouds .",
    "the magnetic field strength and density of molecular clouds are derived from the observed radius and fwhm linewidth based on the uniformly magnetic field sphere model .",
