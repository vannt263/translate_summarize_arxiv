    "the neutrostriction forces are to be taken into account in calculation of neutron star .",
    "they play important role at low densities and small masses @xmath111 .",
    "more over they present many interesting problems worth of research for their own .    1 .",
    "it seems that neutron - neutron interaction in the degenerated neutron gas is eliminated because of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "however the pauli exclusion principle , as correctly is pointed out in  @xcite , eliminates scattering process and imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , but it does not affect its real part . it means that because of the pauli exclusion principle the optical potential in neutron stars becomes lossless .",
    "the decrease of @xmath112 with density is a source of pulsations , and it is interesting to investigate how well possible pulsation match parameters of the observed pulsars .",
    "3 .   the pulsations are especially well understandable , if scattering contains a resonance , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ ff3 ] . at some energy",
    "the scattering amplitude changes the sign , so for smaller density the optical potential is attractive , and for larger one it becomes repulsive . at the point @xmath113 , where @xmath114 , pulsations arise naturally .",
    "in the case of resonance we have a mechanism for star explosion . indeed , if at contraction the density ( and therefore fermi energy ) overcomes the resonant point , the strong repulsive optical energy changes to strong attractive one , and a huge energy is released .",
    "protons were not considered in this evaluation , however inclusion of protons will not change the arguments about optical potential , because the coherent neutron - proton scattering amplitude is nearly the same as the neutron - neutron one . at the same time , with protons one must also take into account neutron - proton resonances , which do certainly exist .",
    "their presence can also provide a source of pulsations and explosions .",
    "we considered only s - scattering amplitude . however , when the energy ( or density ) increases , one must also include p- , d- and higher harmonics .",
    "the question arises : how will they affect the results .",
    "this paper discussed only neutron stars , but the notion of the optical potential is considerably more widely applicable .",
    "it can be used in other stars , in bose - einstein condensates , superfluidity and superconductivity , because everywhere we must take into account the coherent atom - atom and atom - electron scattering amplitude .",

    "it is formula ( 11.65 ) for chemical potential @xmath116 , obtained by v.m.galitskii : @xmath117 , \\eqno(11.65)\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is scattering length , and @xmath38 is fermi wave - number : @xmath118 is particle density .",
    "this formula was obtained for dilute fermi - gas , when @xmath119 , which case is just what i discuss in my paper .",
    "if we neglect last term @xmath120 , we can rewrite ( 11.65 ) in the form @xmath121 and the second term is just optical potential which i introduced in ( 1 ) ( in my notation scattering length @xmath28 is @xmath4 ) .",
    "attractive , negative , potentials are not considered by many - body theory because , according to problem 1.2 of the chapter 1 , a system with a potential @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , will always collapse .",
    "the collapse follows from expression ( i ) , because for negative @xmath28 and high density @xmath41 chemical potential becomes @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is a constant , which goes to @xmath127 when @xmath128 .",
    "it is correct for constant @xmath28 , but it is not correct , if we take into account energy dependence of @xmath28 . my formulas ( 7 ) and ( 8) introduce dependence @xmath129 , where @xmath75 is effective radius of interaction , so we have no collapse .",
    "more over , if neutron - neutron interaction contains a repulsive core , the scattering length can become positive at high density .",
    "i can summarize as follows : the sophisticated mathematics contains everything , but without physical idea it is difficult to predict something . on the other hand , a physical idea helps to predict with few relevant mathematics , however , and it is especially important , the correct idea is always supported by sophisticated mathematics .",
    "my paper contains idea , it helps to predict some phenomena and it is supported by many - body theory .",
    "i think it is an important contribution both : to physics of neutron stars and to many - body theory .",
    "i concur with the comments of the first and second referee .",
    "the physics discussed in this manuscript is not new and is presented in a misleading way ( e.g. , the comparison of gravitational and `` optical '' energies using the scattering length only throughout the volume of the neutron star ) .",
    "no argument is an argument for dr .",
    "furnstahl , who `` concurs with the comments of the first and second referee '' without an argument .",
    "he writes that `` the physics discussed in this manuscript is not new '' .",
    "then how does he concur with the statement of the first referee : `` everything in this paper is just wrong '' ?",
    "he writes that my not new physics `` is presented in a misleading way ( e.g. , the comparison of gravitational and ' ' optical `` energies using the scattering length only throughout the volume of the neutron star ) . ''",
    "i can not understand neither this sentence , nor what is misleading in such a comparison ?",
    "may i ask you : do you understand ?",
    "may i ask you to explain it to me ?    now , when everything is in vain , may i ask you to send all my files to editor - in - chief dr . blume ?",
    "i know that his reply will be negative and formal .",
    "i can even formulate his reply , but will not do that .",
    "let his secretary to use a template to support the decision of the editorial board and to blame me for insulting manners .",
    "his reply will not help , but i need it as a last stone for a monument to american physical society .",
    "thank you for your message .",
    "we will soon initiate the appeal of your manuscript to the editor - in - chief .",
    "we are writing to ask you to draft an appropriate cover letter .",
    "your current letter may be interpreted as polemical .",
    "your appeal letter should clearly demonstrate why your manuscript warrants publication in view of the arguments presented by the referees , editors and the editorial board member .",
    "lenaghan , i was really surprised to get your friendly letter after so long silence .",
    "may i ask you to teach me , how to compose such a letter .",
    "i prepared it , but i am not sure it has an appropriate form .",
    "i has a terrible experience that no appeal is successful after rejection by editorial board .",
    "nevertheless , i am ready to try and try again .",
    "may i ask you to help me ? read , please , my reply , and give me to know , please , what is it better to change .",
    "yours sincerely vladinir .",
    "in this paper i had shown that neutron - neutron scattering forms strong attractive optical potential inside neutron stars , which compresses the star together additionally to gravity .",
    "this attraction decreases with increase of density , but leads to many interesting physical effects and influences such parameters of neutron stars , as radius , mass and distribution of density .",
    "effect of this optical potential can surpass effects of general relativity .",
    "my paper was considered by two anonymous referees and by a memeber of physical review c editorial board richard furnstahl .",
    "so formally my paper met a fair hearing .",
    "however the reports of all these referees show that they did not consider my paper responsibly .",
    "may i ask you to look , please , at their arguments and my responses .",
    "the first report of the first referee started with the words : `` everything in this paper is just wrong and it should never be published . ''",
    "he pointed out several `` errors '' and claimed that `` there is no new mechanism or physics at play here , the optical potential is entirely linked with the many - body physics , which in turn sets up a repulsive eos ( due to the pauli principle ) which counteracts gravity . ''",
    "the last sentence clearly shows presumption of the first referee .",
    "i calmly replied .",
    "included some references , which the first referee supposed to be omitted intentionally , and explained to the referee all his misunderstandings with respect to `` errors '' .",
    "his second report was softer , however he insisted on his presumption .",
    "our difference was : referee claimed that many body contains everything , and it does not show my effects , while i insisted that many body theore is incomplete , because it does not show my effects .",
    "the second referee also rejected my paper on the same presumption .",
    "his report started with the words : `` i agree with the previous referee in all respects , so i have nothing to add that would be of interest to the editors . ''",
    "he tried to teach me that the state of the art of calculations became more sophisticated than my approach which is alike to the old - fashoned hartree approach to the many body theory .",
    "he wrote that optical potential and an index of refraction can be found from the born forward scattering amplitude .",
    "the truth of this reply is not complete .",
    "the scattering amplitude can be derived from precise equations and it can differ in sign from the born amplitude .",
    "such a difference is crucial for determination of the sign of the optical potential .",
    "i used my right to appeal , and during preparation of my appeal letter , i studied more carefully the many - body theory and found that in principle it really contains the attractive optical potential , but it was overlooked by scientists , and i even understood why .",
    "i pointed out it in my appeal letter .",
    "i found also that the error in many body theory is related to the widely accepted practice of discretesation .",
    "we all introduce finite dimension l , when we describe scattering .",
    "it seems very natural , but i found the first case where this practice leads to an error .",
    "i pointed it out .    in reply to my appeal letter , the member of editorial board dr .",
    "richard furnstahl did not discuss the point i mentioned .",
    "his report starts with the words : `` i concur with the comments of the first and second referee .",
    "the physics discussed in this manuscript is not new and is presented in a misleading way . ''",
    "these words are not understandable . if it is not new physics , why the neutrostriction forces are not discussed by astrophysical community ? if it is not new physics , why the first referee , with whose report dr .",
    "furnstahl concurs , claimed that it is wrong physics ?",
    "blume , i would be very grateful to you if you find a time or ask some other experts to explain me what did dr furnstahl meant .",
    "i still continue to think that my paper is a very important contribution to the neutron star physics and to many - body theory .",
    "i have reviewed the file concerning this manuscript which was submitted to phys .",
    "rev . c. the scientific review of your paper is the responsibility of the editor of phys .",
    "c , and resulted in the decision to reject your paper .",
    "the editor - in - chief must assure that the procedures of our journals have been followed responsibly and fairly in arriving at this decision .",
    "contrary to your assumption , every appeal case that is submitted to me receives a thorough review .",
    "i note that the referee and editorial board member were unanimous in their opinion that your paper was not appropriate for phys .",
    "c. let me add that we take pride in our appeal process .",
    "many other journals have no such policy ; for those journals an editorial rejection is final and authors have no right to appeal .    on considering all aspects of this",
    "file i have concluded that our procedures have in fact been appropriately followed and that your paper received a fair review .",
    "accordingly , i must uphold the decision of the editors",
    ".          thank you for your reply and for taking time to review my case .",
    "i continue to be strongly convinced , that my paper contains important work , which can and should be allowed to appear in phys .",
    "i still believe that the referees unfortunately were not well qualified to review my manuscript , because from their comments i deduce that they did not understand my work .",
    "i have a concern about the appeal process , namely : were there any precedents when the opinion of editorial board member was opposite to unanimous opinion of two referees ? were there any precedents when your decision was opposite to that of the editorial board ? if not , the appeal process seems to fail , as the unanimous opinion of two referees predefines the appeal outcome .",
    "i would like to suggest a person , who is to my opinion qualified to listen and understand the arguments .",
    "furthermore , it will be even better if you could also choose one , and then compare the judgments of these two people to help you to come up with the final decision .",
    "i understand that it will require some of your time , but it will be well rewarded by the benefit to science .",
