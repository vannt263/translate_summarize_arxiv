    "atom interferometry has emerged as an important new research area in the past fifteen years @xcite .",
    "thermal atoms offer unique properties as the working element of an interferometer , owing to their small de broglie wavelength .",
    "atom interferometry has already led to impressive results in precision measurements of @xmath6 @xcite , atomic polarizability @xcite , rotation rates @xcite and the acceleration of gravity @xcite .",
    "applications to nanolithography have also been proposed @xcite . despite the advances in atom interferometry , there remains some controversy as to what constitutes an atom interferometer .",
    "we have discussed previously @xcite the distinction between classical and quantum scattering for atom interferometers in which microfabricated gratings are used as the  optical  elements in the interferometer . in this paper , we extend this discussion to atom interferometers that employ optical fields to modify the atomic state wave function .    in our effort to classify atom interferometers , it will prove useful to summarize the conclusions we reached in analyzing the scattering of atoms by microfabricated gratings @xcite . as a model system",
    ", we consider the scattering of an atomic beam by two microfabricated gratings separated by a distance @xmath7 .",
    "the internal structure of the atoms is irrelevant here , since the atoms are in their ground state and the scattering by the gratings is assumed to be the same for any and all ground state sublevels - there is no internal state coherence . for an angular divergence of the atomic beam , @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the grating period , the atomic density is uniform in the region between the gratings , but can exhibit  fringes  beyond the second grating . in particular , at a distance @xmath11 from the first grating , fringes having period @xmath10 are produced .",
    "as such , this device has the appearance of an interferometer . moreover , it can be used to measure inertial effects @xcite , since the fringes are displaced if the atoms accelerate between the interaction zones .",
    "further evidence that this device constitutes an interferometer is provided by a theoretical description of the scattering in which the microfabricated gratings create coherence between transverse momentum components of the incoming atomic beam , taken as a plane wave . despite all these features , it is incorrect to conclude that such a system legitimately qualifies as an atom interferometer .    to clarify matters",
    ", it is best to back up a bit and consider the scattering of an atomic beam by a single grating . at a distance @xmath7 from the grating",
    ", the nature of the scattering is determined by the so called talbot length @xcite , defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the atomic de broglie wavelength ( @xmath14 is the atomic mass and @xmath15 is the longitudinal atomic speed ) . for @xmath16 ,",
    "diffraction effects are unimportant and one is in the classical scattering limit . for a highly collimated beam ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the pattern produced on a screen at a distance @xmath18 from the microfabricated grating is simply the _ shadow _ of the grating .",
    "this is clearly a classical effect .    of course",
    ", the classical scattering limit can be obtained from a calculation in which the center - of - mass motion is quantized .",
    "if such a fully quantum calculation is carried out , one finds that , immediately following the grating , the atomic state wave function contains coherence between different transverse momentum components .",
    "the _ atomic state amplitude grating _ or matter grating created by the microfabricated grating necessarily implies the existence of such coherence . however , for @xmath18 , this coherence is _ not _ evidence for quantum scattering since it corresponds simply to the classical shadow effect . the relative phase associated with the coherence associated with two transverse momentum components , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is a recoil frequency .",
    "the first term is a doppler shift , independent @xmath6 - it has a classical origin .",
    "the second term is a recoil shift which vanishes in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "it is a purely quantum term .",
    "thus , for @xmath26 , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath27 the scattering is classical and the coherence between transverse momentum components corresponds to a classical doppler shift .",
    "it should now be clear that the fringes produced in the two - grating interferometer have nothing to do with quantization of the atomic motion when @xmath18 .",
    "they result simply from a shadow effect and constitute a moir pattern . for grating separations",
    "@xmath28 , quantum diffraction effects begin to play a role ; however , the conditions for fringe production are still determined by classical considerations related to cancellation of a doppler phase .",
    "we return now to atom interferometers which use optical fields to create atomic coherence between internal states , external states , or both . depending on which coherence",
    "is created and probed , one can classify such atom interferometers into three general categories .",
    "classical atom interferometers ( cai ) in no way rely on quantization of the atoms center - of - mass motion for their operation .",
    "the cai operate in the regimes @xmath29 or @xmath18 , for which quantum scattering effects can be ignored .",
    "if one restricts the use of the term  atom interferometer  to those devices which depend on quantization of the atoms center - of - mass motion for their operation , the cai would not qualify .",
    "examples of cai include those based on radio - frequency @xcite or optical @xcite ramsey fringes .",
    "matter wave atom interferometers operate only in the regime @xmath30 or @xmath31 we distinguish matter wave atom interferometers in which the _ total _ atomic density is monitored from those in which an internal state coherence or population is probed .",
    "the former we refer to simply as matter wave atom interferometers ( mwai ) and the latter as internal state matter wave atom interferometers ( ismwai ) .",
    "an important feature which distinguishes mwai from ismwai is the dependence of the observed signal on the parameter @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the ismwai signal does not vanish in the limit @xmath26 or @xmath18 , but _ does _ vanish in this limit for mwai . in other words ,",
    "mwai depend critically on the quantization of the atoms center of mass motion for their operation , whereas ismwai can operate in the classical or quantum scattering limits .",
    "although matter wave effects can modify the signals in ismwai , many features of the signals are determined by classical considerations , as in cai .",
    "examples of ismwai interferometers include those which explore recoil splitting of optical ramsey fringes in the frequency domain @xcite , and time - domain @xcite .",
    "matter wave atom interferometers can be constructed using off - resonant standing wave optical fields .",
    "such fields act as phase gratings for the matter waves .",
    "atoms enter a field interaction region in their ground state and leave the region with their spatial density unaffected . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ phase _ of the ground state wave function is spatially modulated , corresponding to a coherence between momentum states differing by @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is an integer and @xmath36 is the period of the standing wave field ) . as the matter wave evolves freely following the field interaction region , the phase modulated wave function is transformed into a spatially modulated density , which can be probed using various techniques .",
    "atom interferometers can be constructed using two or more field interaction zones @xcite . in the transient echo experiment of cahn _",
    "@xcite , the vanishing of spatial modulation at the echo times @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( but not in the immediate vicinity of the echo times ) is consistent with mwai theory @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also found that the spatial modulation vanished in the classical scattering region , @xmath39 , as it must for any mwai .",
    "it is also possible to create mwai by resonantly driving one - photon transitions between electronic states @xcite or two - photon raman transitions between ground state sublevels using optical fields",
    ". the lifetime of the electronic or ground state coherence must be greater than @xmath40 a condition that restricts one to intercombination lines in the case of electronic state coherence .",
    "it is possible to show @xcite that the sum of the spatially modulated atomic gratings created by the fields in each of the states involved in the transition ( that is , the total atomic density ) vanishes in the classical scattering limit , but is nonvanishing in the quantum scattering domain , @xmath41 .",
    "this effect has not yet been observed .",
    "if one were to probe the total atomic density rather than some internal state density in the experiments of @xcite , the sought after effect should be observable .    in this paper",
    ", we describe a new type of mwai @xcite that also uses resonant rather than off - resonant fields .",
    "two - level atoms pass through a standing wave , optical field that resonantly drives a _",
    "closed _ two - level transition in the atoms .",
    "in contrast to the scheme described above , it is now assumed that the excited state lifetime is much less than @xmath42 .",
    "as a result of the atom - field interaction , an excited state matter grating in the excited state is created , as is a  hole grating  in the ground state . if one neglects all effects related to quantization of the atoms center - of - mass motion , it is easy to show that , after the excited state decay back to the ground state , the ground state density is uniform . in some sense ,",
    "the excited state grating fills the  hole  in the ground state density that had been created by the field .",
    "when the recoil associated with stimulated @xcite and spontaneous@xcite processes are included , however , new features appear in the ground state density matrix .",
    "it is not possible to interpret the interaction in simple terms as was the case for a phase grating , but the net result is that recoil leads to a nonvanishing spatially modulated atomic density for @xmath41 or @xmath28 . in analyzing the signal",
    ", it will prove useful to separate the contributions from spontaneous and stimulated processes . immediately following the excited state decay ,",
    "these two contributions cancel one another , but as time progresses , the contribution from spontaneous processes disappears , leaving a net modulated ground state density .",
    "when two field interaction zones are used , echo - like phenomena can occur .",
    "it will be seen that _ both _ stimulated and spontaneous processes contribute to the echo signals , even for pulse separations @xmath43    the paper is arranged as follows .",

    "iii we consider atom interference using a single atom - field interaction zone and a homogeneous distribution of atomic velocities .",
    "it is seen that focussing of the atoms , similar to that found with phase gratings , can also occur using resonant fields .",
    "the conditions under which the spatially modulated atomic density becomes a periodic function of @xmath2 ( talbot effect ) are established .",
    "the atomic density following two atom - field interaction zones is calculated for an inhomogeneously broadened transition ( talbot - lau regime ) in sec .",

    "consequently , we restrict our calculations to the time domain .    two - level ( upper state @xmath44 and ground state @xmath45 ) atoms are subjected to two radiation pulses separated by a time interval @xmath4 . _",
