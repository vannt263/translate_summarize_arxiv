    "<S> we study the dynamics of the ` batch ' minority game with market - impact correction using generating functional techniques to carry out the quenched disorder average . we find that the assumption of weak long - term memory , which one usually makes in order to calculate ergodic stationary states , breaks down when the persistent autocorrelation becomes larger than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this condition , remarkably , coincides with the at - line found in an earlier static calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests a new scenario for ergodicity breaking in disordered systems .    the minority game ( mg ) models a market of speculators interacting through a simple supply - and - demand mechanism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the key behavioural assumptions of the original model is that agents act as so - called price - takers , meaning that at every stage of the game each of them only perceives the aggregate action of all agents , i.e. the total bid . </S>",
    "<S> recently , in @xcite , a generalization has been introduced in which agents are able to estimate their own contribution to the total bid and use this additional information to adjust their learning dynamics and optimize their performance . </S>",
    "<S> the statics of this model has been tackled by spin - glass techniques in @xcite along the lines of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system was found to approximately minimize a disordered hamiltonian @xmath1 whose minima could be calculated with the replica method . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) can occur , implying the existence of multiple stationary states .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we adapt the dynamical method used in @xcite to analyze the ` batch ' version of this model . assuming time - translation invariance , finite integrated response and weak long - term memory @xcite we obtain exact results for the stationary state which are in excellent agreement with computer experiments and with earlier static approaches . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we derive a condition for the continuous onset of memory , where the assumption of weak long - term memory is found to fail while time - translation invariance still holds . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be different from the usual aging scenario in non - ergodic disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the memory - onset condition coincides with the at line found in statics .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by recalling the definition of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider @xmath2 agents labeled by roman indices . at each iteration </S>",
    "<S> round @xmath3 all agents receive the same information pattern @xmath4 drawn at random with uniform probability from @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> each agent has at his disposal @xmath6 different strategies ( labeled by @xmath7 ) to convert the acquired information into a trading decision . </S>",
    "<S> strategies are denoted by @xmath8-dimensional vectors : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the trading action ( e.g. @xmath11 for ` buy ' , @xmath12 for ` sell ' ) prescribed to agent @xmath13 by his @xmath14-th strategy given receipt of information @xmath15 . by assumption , </S>",
    "<S> each component @xmath10 is selected randomly and independently from @xmath16 with uniform probabilities before the start of the game , for all @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this introduces quenched disorder into the model . </S>",
    "<S> each strategy of every agent is given an initial valuation @xmath17 , which is updated at the end of every round . at the start of round @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> given @xmath4 , every agent selects the strategy with the highest valuation , @xmath18 , and subsequently makes a bid according to the trading decision set by the selected strategy : @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> the first term in square brackets embodies the minority rule , in that the valuation of a strategy is increased every time it predicts the correct minority action , independently of it having been actually used . </S>",
    "<S> the term proportional to @xmath22 adjusts the total bid for the possibility that agent @xmath13 is not using strategy @xmath23 . for @xmath24 one </S>",

    "<S> the external field @xmath38 has been added for later use . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the more usual ` on - line ' model ( [ ddd ] ) , where the @xmath39 s are updated after every iteration step , in the ` batch ' case the updates are made on the basis of the average effect of all possible choices of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this modified dynamics yields results for the stationary state which are quantitatively very similar to those of the original model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical advantage of the ` batch ' formulation is that it circumvents the difficulty of constructing a proper continuous time limit . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical advantage is that one can simulate larger systems for a longer time . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , one derives the effective non - linear single - agent equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 is a gaussian noise with zero mean and temporal correlations given by @xmath43 the matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 appearing here are the noise - averaged single - agent correlation and response functions for the process ( [ dyna ] ) , with elements @xmath46 respectively , while @xmath47 is the identity matrix and @xmath48 denotes the matrix with all entries equal to one . </S>",
    "<S> the link between the markovian multi - agent system ( [ ddd ] ) and the non - markovian single - agent process ( [ dyna ] ) is established by the fact that , for @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 become identical to the disorder- and agent - averaged correlation and response functions of ( [ ddd ] ) : @xmath52_{{\\rm dis } } \\quad{\\rm and}\\quad g_{tt'}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{\\left}[\\frac{\\partial s_i(t)}{\\partial\\theta_i(t')}{\\right}]_{{\\rm dis}}\\ ] ]    eqs ( [ dyna]-[gc ] ) describe the dynamics of the system exactly in the @xmath49 limit . </S>",
    "<S> we now move to the stationary states of ( [ dyna ] ) upon making the following assumptions :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     for the re - scaled quantity @xmath53 one finds @xmath54 where @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 , while @xmath57 is a static field . </S>",
    "<S> the variance of the zero - average gaussian random variable @xmath58 can be calculated from ( [ cortemp ] ) , yielding @xmath59 with the persistent correlation @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the effective agent is ` frozen ' if @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 and he is always employing the same strategy . setting @xmath63 , </S>",

    "<S> he is instead fickle when @xmath67 or @xmath68 , and in this case @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> a self - consistent equation for @xmath70 can now be derived by separating the contribution of the frozen agents from that of the fickle ones . upon defining @xmath71 one </S>",

    "<S> one obtains @xmath77 equations ( [ var]-[chi ] ) form a closed set from which one can solve for @xmath78 , @xmath70 and @xmath79 for any @xmath80 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath70 are shown in figure 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> for negative @xmath22 , one observes an excellent agreement between theory and experiment for all values of @xmath80 , implying that none of our assumptions is ever violated .    when @xmath24 , we recover the results of @xcite , which match the simulations perfectly for @xmath80 larger than the critical value @xmath81 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> the integrated response @xmath79 diverges ( fir is violated ) and a transition to a highly non - ergodic regime takes place , where the stationary state depends on the initial conditions @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> starting with @xmath83 leads to a high volatility state , while starting with @xmath84 leads to relatively low volatility . </S>",
    "<S> the latter regime can be solved using the assumption that @xmath79 remains very large for all @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if @xmath86 then @xmath87 so that @xmath88 , which is equivalent to @xmath89 . solving this for @xmath90 and inserting the resulting value in ( [ c ] ) , we obtain the top left branch of the @xmath24 curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , which is again in excellent agreement with numerical results .    for positive @xmath22 </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that when @xmath91 our theoretical predictions deviate from the experimental observations , whereas the agreement is perfect for @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> finding no violation of fir , we have to conclude that either tti or wltm is violated . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have found no evidence of aging . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect the deviations to be related to the breakdown of wltm only . to find the onset of memory , we split @xmath51 in its tti part and its non - tti part : @xmath93 during the initial stages of the game , small perturbations can cause some agents , which would otherwise have remained fickle , to freeze and vice versa , thus creating a persistent part @xmath94 in the response function . as the agents freeze </S>",
    "<S> , their state ( and consequently their contribution to @xmath45 ) becomes independent of @xmath35 , so that we expect @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> after an initial equilibration period , for all frozen agents the difference between the strategy valuations have become very large , so they are virtually insensitive to perturbations . hence we must assume that @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> the fickle agents , however , remain sensitive to small perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the effects will wear out over time ( finite response ) and are given by @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath94 is small , we expand @xmath98 in powers of @xmath94 up to first order : @xmath99 defining @xmath100 and @xmath101 , one then finds asymptotically @xmath102\\!(t',t'')s(t'')\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the rectified linear function @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 otherwise , we see that if @xmath106 then @xmath107\\!(t',t'')s(t '' )    { \\right}]{\\right } ) , \\\\    \\widetilde{\\gamma}=\\sqrt{\\alpha}{\\left}(\\frac{1}{1+\\widetilde{\\chi}}-\\eta{\\right } )    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , we have @xmath108 , whereas @xmath109\\!(t',t '' )    \\widetilde{g}(t'',t)\\ ] ] up to first order in @xmath94 one finds @xmath110+\\or(\\widehat{g}^2)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath111 is always a solution of this equation , a bifurcation occurs when @xmath112=1 $ ] , which is equivalent to @xmath113 ^ 2 $ ] , and can be written in terms of @xmath90 as @xmath114={\\overline{\\phi(\\lambda)}}\\ ] ] we call this line in the @xmath115 plane the memory - onset ( mo ) line , see figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> it coincides remarkably with the at - line ( see appendix ) , and implies that the bifurcation occurs at @xmath116 for @xmath117 . above this value </S>",
    "<S> , wltm can be broken , and indeed one sees from figure 1 that numerical results deviate from our theoretical predictions for @xmath118 . to give further evidence of memory , we have analyzed the time evolution of two identical copies @xmath119 and @xmath120 of the system , starting from slightly different initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we plotted in figure 3 the distance @xmath121 of the stationary states , given by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the long - time average of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , versus the persistent autocorrelation of copy @xmath119 , @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath126 approaches @xmath127 , the two copies end up in different stationary states , proving that they remember initial conditions . at the same time , if a perturbation is applied much later during the run the copies end up in the same stationary state , indicating that indeed @xmath128 as @xmath129 .    summarizing , we have shown that in this model the usual connection between broken ergodicity and broken tti ( aging ) , as seen for instance in mean - field spin glasses @xcite , does not occur . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we derive from the dynamics a condition for breakdown of wltm and continuous onset of memory within the tti regime , which is found to be equivalent to the at - line found in the static approach . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable deviation from the well - known rsb / aging picture is possibly due to the fact that the microscopic dynamics of our model does not satisfy detailed balance .    </S>",
