    "since brown dwarfs only briefly stabilize themselves on a deuterium burning `` main - sequence '' , after which they continue to contract and to cool down , there is in general a degeneracy between brown dwarf mass and luminosity or age and temperature .",
    "dynamical mass estimates derived from the orbital parameters of binary brown dwarfs are the only means to measure one of the fundamental astrophysical quantities , and to improve our understanding of substellar objects",
    ". binary properties of brown dwarfs should reflect on their formation mechanism , and hence provide insights into the origin of brown dwarfs .",
    "finally , since brown dwarfs are considerably less luminous than stars , it is much easier to identify young , still self luminous planetary mass objects in orbit around brown dwarfs than around stars .",
    "our group has been studying binary brown dwarfs since 1998 . in the following",
    "we summarize ongoing surveys for spatially resolved brown dwarf binaries , and present results of follow - up studies using hst and ground - based adaptive optics .",
    "more than 140 nearby ultra - cool dwarfs and brown dwarfs with spectral types late m ( later than m7 ) and l have by now been surveyed for companions by close et al .",
    "( 2002a , 2002b ) using ground - based adaptive optics ( hokupa@xmath0a ) at gemini north , and by reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , bouy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , gizis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and golimowski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .    as the typical separation of the binary components is less than 0.5@xmath1",
    ", high - angular resolution observations are mandatory if one wants to study the properties of the individual components of these binary systems .",
    "the 27 binaries studied in greater detail by bouy et al .  (",
    "2003 ) are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the parameter space covered in brightness ratio ( @xmath2mag ) and separation is shown in figure [ fig2 ] . even though it would have been possible to detect companions up to 5.5mag fainter than the primaries , the observed brightness differences are in general @xmath31mag .",
    "this indicates a strong preference for equal mass binaries among brown dwarfs .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] compares the distribution of semi - major axis to the distribution found among solar - type stars .",
    "the most striking feature is the lack of wide binaries with separations larger than @xmath420a.u .  among the brown dwarfs .",
    "the lack of brown dwarf binaries with separations smaller than @xmath41a.u .  might still be a detection bias , since such systems would be unresolved even at the angular resolution provided by hst .",
    "once companions have been identified , second epoch observations are important to confirm that the objects form indeed physical binaries , and in order to start the monitoring of the orbital motion of the two binary components around their common center of mass . in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show two examples for multi - epoch monitoring of binary l - dwarfs with the aim to derive the orbital parameters , and dynamical system masses . on the top",
    "we show the results of 5.5years of continued observations of denis - pj1228.2 - 1547 , the first spatially resolved binary l - dwarf ( martn et al .  1999 ; brandner et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) . on the bottom",
    "we show the results of 4 years of monitoring of 2masswj0746425 + 2000321 , the first l - dwarf with a complete determination of the orbital parameters , and hence the first system for which precise dynamical mass estimates have been derived ( bouy et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "monitoring programmes for other binary l- and t - dwarfs are on - going , and we expect to derive more dynamical mass estimates within the next 5 to 10yr .",
    "apart from the determination of dynamical mass estimates and related physical properties of individual brown dwarfs , our study also aims at a better understanding of the formation processes of ( binary ) brown dwarfs .",
    "one of the currently discussed formation processes is the so - called `` embryo - ejection '' model ( reipurth & clarke 2001 ) , where brown dwarfs are ejected from multiple systems during the main - accretion phase .",
    "parameters studies of the dynamical interactions of three 40m@xmath5 , still accreting proto - brown dwarfs have been carried out by umbreit et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    for comparison of the resulting separation distribution with observations ,",
    "our magnitude limited sample of binary l - dwarfs has first to be transformed into a distance limited sample . as can be seen from figure [ fig5 ] , top ,",
    "our sample is complete only out to distances of @xmath422pc , hence only binaries within 22pc are considered in the following .",
    "the resulting distribution of binary separations for the distance limited sample is shown as a histogram in figure [ fig5 ] , bottom .",
    "overplotted in blue ( continuous line ) is the distribution of separations derived in the simulations for one particular value of accretion rates .",
    "the good agreement between simulations and observations is very encouraging , though more detailed simulations , and an extension of observational studies towards smaller binary separations are required before any firm conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the next step is a survey for planetary mass companions to brown dwarfs . ongoing observations with hst aim at studying 12 of the most nearby and young brown dwarfs for planetary mass companions .",
    "at an age of @xmath31gyr , objects with masses in the range 5 to 10m@xmath5 should still be bright ( hot ) enough to be detectable by their intrinsic radiation . in figure [ fig6 ]",
    "we show simulations for observations with hst / nic1 of a 6m@xmath5 companion to a brown dwarf at two different wavelengths in and out of a molecular absorption band .",
    "the planetary mass companion is nicely detected in the difference image shown on the right ."
