    "( 2 ) how did these cqgs form at higher redshift ?",
    "there are two physical mechanisms which have been proposed to explain the observed structural evolution of cqgs at @xmath13 .",

    "our results show that they have comparable large scale clustering for three different population at @xmath15 : csfgs , smgs and qsos .",
