    "two trends are evident in the fits to the dust surface brightness : 1 ) the peak surface brightness linearly varies with distance from the nucleus , and 2 ) within the uncertainties ( @xmath21 a few degrees in position angle ) the dust emission is aligned with the orbit , as would be expected for a dust trail . to generate model images of the dust ,",

    "[ table [ table : trail ] , figure [ fig : trailpeak ] ] *      previous images of 67p at aphelion show a neck - line tail structure .",
    "a neck - line structure is a thin , linear feature caused by the projected alignment of dust grains that were emitted at a true anomaly 180 prior to the observation in question @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is strongest when the observer is located near the orbital plane of the comet , which is frequently the case for ecliptic comets such as 67p .",
    "small dust grains can not remain near the nucleus for many years ; therefore , if a neck - line is observed in our _ spitzer _ observations , it must be comprised of large dust grains that weakly interact with solar radiation pressure .",
    "observations of neck - lines are beneficial because they allow us to measure the size distribution of dust grains emitted by the comet .",
    "this becomes apparent when we consider that larger dust grains are ejected from the nucleus with lower ejection velocities and are accelerated less effectively by solar radiation pressure than smaller grains .",
    "therefore , the largest grains remain the closest to the nucleus , and the grain size decreases with increasing distance along the neck - line . in principle , the variation of the surface brightness distribution of a neck - line with distance from the nucleus can be transformed into a grain size distribution . in the _ spitzer _ mips images ,",
    "the mere existence of a neck - line can help us constrain the largest grains emitted by 67p .",
    "the age of a neck - line observed on 2006 august 16 would be 3.9  years , corresponding to dust emitted at a post - perihelion distance of @xmath22  au .",
    "similarly , if a neck - line were observed on 2007 may 18 , its age would be 4.6  years , i.e. , released from the nucleus at @xmath23  au , post - perihelion .    in order to determine if a neck - line tail structure exists in our images , we compute simulated images of the comet using the dynamical dust model of @xcite .",
    "the primary forces acting on a dust grain are the force from solar radiation ( @xmath24 ) , the force of solar gravity ( @xmath25 ) , and gravitational perturbations from the planets .",
    "dynamical models of comets typically describe dust grains with the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "both forces vary with @xmath27 , therefore @xmath28 is independent of heliocentric distance .",
    "the @xmath28 parameter does , however , depend on grain size : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the radiation pressure efficiency ( @xmath31 for large grains ) , @xmath32 is the grain density in units of g  @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is grain radius in units of @xcite . when converting from @xmath28-values to grain radii , we follow @xcite and adopt a grain density of 1  g  @xmath33 ( see @xcite for discussion related to this choice ) . to describe the dust ejection dynamics and history of comet 67p , we start with the best parameters of @xcite . in summary , @xcite fit _ spitzer _",
    "mips images of the comet taken on 2004 february 23 ( 4.5  au , pre - aphelion ) and found three distinct dynamical components : 1 ) a dust trail with an age greater than one orbit , 2 ) a neck - line ejected near the 2002 perihelion passage , and 3 ) a broad dust tail .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the dust in the 4.5  au , pre - aphelion , image was best modeled by :    * a dust production proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the sun - zenith angle of a surface element ejecting dust grains , * a size distribution proportional to @xmath37 , * an ejection velocity equal to @xmath38  km  s@xmath6 , and * dust grains with @xmath39 ( 6   @xmath40 60  mm ) .",
    "@xcite assumed the comet s dust production is proportional to dust production rates inferred from optical photometry @xcite , @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the above parameters are similar to those of @xcite , derived by comparison of dynamical models to three epochs of ground - based optical observations .",
    "the greatest differences between the @xcite and @xcite models is the choice of the largest grain sizes sizes ( 60  mm versus 5  mm ) , and dust production rates ( @xmath42 versus @xmath43 ) .",
    "we generated two simulations of 67p using the dynamical model and best parameters of @xcite , with the added stipulation that no grains are ejected outside of @xmath44  au .",
    "this distance corresponds to the comet - sun distance during the february 2004 _ spitzer _ observations , where little to no coma was observed @xcite .",

    "the distinction between neck - line and trail in our observations rests merely on their dynamical parameters , since their grain populations have approximately the same sizes ( @xmath53  mm in radius ) at these heliocentric distances . taking into account our @xmath28-value lower - limit of @xmath54",

    "these values are improvements over the @xcite analysis because the dust width and surface brightness may be measured closer to the nucleus .",

    "visual inspection of the light curves reveals that the maximum - to - minimum flux ratios ( 1.41 and 1.45 ) are similar .",

    "for example , moving sources in the background are not accounted for with our background removal techniques , but may be faint and not apparent in the images .",
    "such background sources have the greatest effect on the faintest parts of the light curve .",
