    "the most common lattice model for reptating polymers is the rubinstein - duke model @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of this model is , that it has sofar defied an exact solution .",
    "therefore it is natural to look for models that are in the same spirit , but which are more open to analytic rather than numerical methods .",
    "recently guidoni et al .",
    "@xcite introduced and analyzed a 1-dimensional model for reptation , to which we shall refer as the `` necklace model '' .",
    "it is a chain that moves through the exchange of beads and vacancies along a line .",
    "the purpose of this note is to show that the model permits an exact solution by means of the matrix product expansion , due to derrida et al . @xcite .",
    "also the spectrum of the master operator can be derived , leading an exact expression for the renewal time .",
    "in addition we relate the properties with those of a special 1-dimensional variant of the rubinstein - duke model with hernia creation and annihilation .",
    "the necklace model is a string of @xmath0 beads located on a line of points .",
    "the beads are either neighbors or nearest neighbors . in the latter case",
    "there is an unoccupied lattice site ( a vacancy ) between the beads . the beads are not allowed to occupy the same lattice point and two consecutive vacancies are forbidden in order to ensure the integrity of the chain .",
    "the possibility of vacancies is an expression of the elasticity of the chain .",
    "the internal beads hop with by exchanging with a vacancy .",
    "the two end - beads can also exchange with a vacancy from outside .",
    "clearly the number of beads is conserved , but not the number of vacancies , which enter and leave at the ends and migrate through the chain . the stationary state of the system follows from the master equation , governing this stochastic motion .",
    "the key to the exact solution is to focus on the motion of the vacancies rather than on that of the beads .",
    "there are @xmath1 positions for the vacancies available , since each vacancy must be surrounded by beads .",
    "each of the @xmath1 positions can be occupied by a vacancy or not .",
    "the state of the chain of beads is fully determined by the occupation distribution of the vacancies .",
    "so we consider the chain as an open system for vacancies , which hop with the rates derived from the motion of the original beads .",
    "their hopping is constrained by the rule that two vacancies can not occupy the same position .",
    "it would mean that the two beads surrounding such a double vacancy would be separated by two vacancies .",
    "transfering the motion for the beads to the vacancies we arrive at the following rules    * an internal vacancy can hop to a neighboring empty position with rate @xmath2 to the right and @xmath3 to the left .",
    "* the exchange of a vacancy with outside goes with rates @xmath4 for entering and @xmath5 for leaving at the left hand end of the chain .",
    "* on the right hand end , the rates are @xmath6 for leaving and @xmath7 for entering .    note that we have primed rates for the hops to the left and unprimed for the motion to the right .",
    "the asymmetry between left and right can be attributed to a driving field on the beads , inducing a bias @xmath8 for a hop to the right and a bias @xmath9 for a leftward hop .",
    "these biases may derive from a charge on the beads , which is influenced by an electric field .",
    "then we have for the ratios the relations @xmath10 for the solubility of the model it is not neccessary to assume these ratios and only when we discuss the properties in more detail , we will use this physical restriction .",
    "the above given rates are more general than those used by guidoni et al .",
    ", in particular we allow for a finite driving field . for our exact solution ,",
    "it is however important that the hopping rules for the internal vacancies are uniform along the chain .",
    "the state of the chain can be represented by @xmath1 variables @xmath11 , which assume the values 1 and 0 , where 1 viz .",
    "0 corresponds to the presence viz .",
    "absense of a vacancy .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath12 of the stationary state follows from the master equation @xmath13 with @xmath14 the master operator .",
    "it contains the usual gain term consisting of all transitions which increase the probability @xmath12 and a loss term which contains all transitions out of the configurations @xmath15 .",
    "the master operator is the sum of @xmath0 operators representing the action of the beads @xmath16 as first example consider the bead at the left hand of the chain , leading to @xmath17 .",
    "it acts on the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath19 , as it only influences the existence of a vacancy on the first position .",
    "it is given by the expression @xmath20 + \\tau_1 [ p_a p ( 0 \\cdots ) - p'_a p(1 \\cdots)].\\ ] ] the first 2 terms refer to the case where a vacancy is absent from the first possible position .",
    "it has a gain and a loss term .",
    "similarly the last 2 terms refer to the case where a vacancy is present .",
    "the expression can be shortened to @xmath21.\\ ] ] in the same way the other parts of the master operator are expressed as @xmath22\\\\*[2 mm ] { \\cal m}_n p ( \\cdots \\tau_n ) & = & ( 1 - 2\\tau_n ) [ p_b   p ( \\cdots 1 ) - p'_b p(\\cdots 0 ) ] .",
    "\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] this form of the master operator shows that it has an eigenvalue 0 , as summation over all @xmath11 yields zero for all individual terms , implying conservation of probability .",
    "the left eigenvector is constant for all configurations , but the right eigenvector is the non - trivial probability distribution of the stationary state .",

    "the states @xmath26 and @xmath36 are fixed by the relations @xmath37 then it is possible to recombine in ( [ b3 ] ) the factors again to probabilities @xmath38 { \\cal m}_j p ( \\tau_1 , \\cdots , \\tau_n ) & = & - \\zeta ( 1 - 2 \\tau_j ) p ( \\tau_1 , \\cdots , \\tau_{j-1 } , \\tau_{j+1 } , \\cdots , \\tau_n ) \\\\*[2 mm ]   & + & \\zeta   ( 1 - 2 \\tau_{j+1 } ) p ( \\tau_1 \\cdots , \\tau_j , \\tau_{j+2 } , \\cdots , \\tau_n ) \\\\*[2 mm ] { \\cal m}_n p ( \\tau_1 , \\cdots , \\tau_n ) & = & -\\zeta   ( 1 - 2 \\tau_n ) p(\\tau_1 , \\cdots , \\tau_{n-1 } ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath39 is arbitrary ; it has been introduced to facilitate the normalization .",
    "the sum over all these relations vanishes , which shows that ( [ b1 ] ) is the stationary state of the master equation .",
    "relation ( [ b5 ] ) can be clarified by the substitution @xmath40 this yields for the creation and annihilation operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 the @xmath43-deformed commutation relation @xmath44 provided that we fix @xmath45 and @xmath43 as @xmath46 the advantage of the new operators is that their spectrum has been thoroughly investigated .",
    "they have similar properties as the usual creation and annihilation operators for the harmonic oscillator .",
    "note that for @xmath47 the operators seem to commute , but it is easy to rescale @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that the right hand side of ( [ b10 ] ) becomes 1 , as often is done @xcite .",
    "the power of the representation is that it gives the probability distribution for all chain lengths @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of the matrices @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the states @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent of @xmath1 .",
    "it requires , however , quite a bit of formal manipulations to retrieve the chain properties from the general expression ( [ b1 ] ) .",
    "the relations ( [ b5 ] ) and ( [ b7 ] ) were mentioned by derrida et al .",
    "they were related to the @xmath43-deformed algebra by sasamoto @xcite and blythe et al .",
    "@xcite , leading to explicit formulae .",
    "unfortunately , the case that we see as most physical ( relations ( [ a1 ] ) and all intrinsic mobilites the same ) , does not fall in the wide range of parameters already treated .",
    "however , the technique that they employ , can be used to deal with our case .",
    "as it is not our aim to marginally extend the exact solutions to an even wider regime , we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "the phase diagram as function of the parameters is governed by the magnitudes of the net hopping rates @xmath48 the smallest is the limiting factor . if the input on the left hand side is small , a dilute phase results . if the output at the right hand side is small , a dense phase will form .",
    "if the throughput in the bulk of the chain is the limiting factor , a maximum current phase appears , with a constant density of vacancies in the bulk .    for illustration",
    "we discuss the case ( [ a1 ] ) , with hopping rates only influenced by the driving field with bias @xmath8 .",
    "then we are in the maximum current phase .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the most interesting property : the drift velocity .",
    "the drift of bead @xmath49 , in a specific configuration , is given by @xmath50 the first term is the probability to jump to the right and the second for that to the left .",
    "remember that the beads jump in the opposite direction of the vacancies . comparing this with relation ( [ a4 ] ) , we have the identity @xmath51 by summing over the variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 , the factor in front of @xmath54 gives 1 and one finds for the average drift @xmath55 this average can be expressed , with the aid of ( [ b8 ] ) as @xmath56 we have dropped the index @xmath49 as the result is obviously independent of @xmath49 .",
    "it has to , since there is no accumulation of beads in the stationary state .",
    "so ( [ c5 ] ) is the expression for the drift velocity , relating it to the normalization factors @xmath57 .",
    "the proportionality of the drift to @xmath58 is simply a matter of times scales : when the rates go up , the drift follows proportionally .",
    "the @xmath57 are expressed in terms of what is called the position operator @xmath59 of the @xmath43-deformed harmonic oscillator . @xmath60",
    "the spectrum of @xmath59 has been investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "it can be represented as @xmath61 the spectrum is continous : @xmath62 .",
    "so we get @xmath63^n \\",
    ", \\langle w |\\theta \\rangle \\langle \\theta | v \\rangle\\ ] ] here @xmath64 is a function that enters in the closure relation for the states @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) . for large @xmath1",
    "the power of @xmath66 gets strongly peaked around @xmath67 and one can apply the saddle point method to find the leading term .",
    "we put @xmath67 in all non - singular terms yielding @xmath68 where the factor @xmath69 is independent of @xmath1 and contains amongst others the factor @xmath70 .",
    "fortunately this factor drops out in the drift velocity .",
    "@xmath71 the drift vanishes of course when the bias @xmath72 , but its leading term does not decay with the power @xmath73 as does the drift in the rd - model .",
    "the diffusion coefficient is usually defined in the limit that the driving field vanishes @xmath72 . using the einstein relation one has to divide by a factor @xmath1 and this leads to the ( dimensionless ) value @xmath74 relations ( [ c12 ] ) and ( [ c13 ] )",
    "show that we are in the maximum current regime , which is not limited by the input and output at the ends of the chain .",
    "the asymptotically leading behavior is of course the most interesting result , showing the strength of the matrix product expansion .",
    "however , it is also worth while to see that the whole behavior is determined by the commutation relation ( [ b10 ] ) . to illustrate this point we confine ourselves to the physical restriction ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "then the equations for @xmath75 and @xmath76 reduce to @xmath77 note that @xmath78 since the first relation ( [ d1 ] ) is the conjugate of the second .    as first example of playing with commutation relations consider @xmath79 where we used ( [ d1 ] ) to interchange @xmath42 and @xmath41 by applying @xmath42 to @xmath80 and @xmath41 to @xmath81 . as @xmath82 the average has to vanish .",
    "this holds also for all odd powers of @xmath83 .",
    "the second example is the average of @xmath84 , for which we first use the relations ( [ d1 ] ) @xmath85 but the commutation relation ( [ b10 ] ) can also be used to convert the right hand side of ( [ d3 ] ) to the left hand side expression . from these two relations one deduces @xmath86 all other averages of 2 creation or annihilation operators directly follow , with ( [ d1 ] ) , from this expression .",
    "so the current of the 2 link system equals @xmath87 an expression , which of course , can also be obtained by solving the probability distribution from the master equation . by this technique",
    "it will be a long and hard road to get to the behavior at large @xmath1 .",
    "another interesting quantity is the renewal time . it is defined as the slowest time of decay towards the stationary state and it follows from the spectrum of the master operator as the eigenvalue with the smallest negative real part .",
    "clearly the corresponding state decays the slowest and the renewal time is the inverse of the gap in the spectrum .",
    "the matrix product representation does not lead to the full spectrum of the master operator ; it only gives the stationary state eigenfunction . on the other hand",
    "the renewal is usually defined in the fieldless case for which the master operator becomes hermitian ( or symmetric in our case ) .",
    "the terms of the master operator can be expressed in terms of the operators @xmath88 , creating a vacancy , and @xmath89 annihilating a vacancy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath90 { \\cal m}_j & = &    b ( a^\\dagger_j a_{j+1 } - a_j a^\\dagger_j a^\\dagger_{j+1 } a_{j+1 } ) + b^{-1 } ( a_j a^\\dagger_{j+1 } - a^\\dagger_j a_j a_{j+1 } a^\\dagger_{j+1}),\\\\*[2 mm ] { \\cal m}_0 & = & b^{-1 } ( a_n - a^\\dagger_n a_n ) + b ( a^\\dagger_n -a_n a^\\dagger_n ) . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the @xmath89 are hard core boson operators , equivalent with spin @xmath91 operators , via the relations @xmath92 with the consequence @xmath93 where the @xmath94a are the pauli matrices .",
    "the master operator , expressed in these spin operators , is an unusual hamiltonian since it is non - hermitian .",
    "however , for the undriven system @xmath95 , it turns into the well known ferromagnetic heisenberg chain . @xmath96 + \\sigma^x_1 + \\sigma^x_n -2.\\ ] ] due to the magnetic field in the @xmath97 direction on the boundaries of the chain , it is profitable to work in a basis of eigenstates of @xmath98 .",
    "these are the symmetric ( spin up ) and the anti - symmetric ( spin down ) combinations of a vacancy and its absence .",
    "latexmath:[\\[\\label{e5 }     the `` groundstate '' ( being the highest in the spectrum ) of the chain is the state with all spins directed in the @xmath97 direction , which has an eigenvalue 0 . in vacancy language",
    "this is the state in which all configurations have the same probability .    as the hamiltonian ( [ e4 ] )",
    "conserves the number of spins in the @xmath97 direction the spectrum breaks up into sectors with a given number of spins up .",
    "the smallest excitation from the `` groundstate '' is in the sector with one spin down .",
    "let @xmath100 be the value of the state with the down spin at the position @xmath101 .",
    "then we have the set of equations @xmath102",
    "x_1 & - & ( 2 + \\lambda ) x_2 & + & x_3 &          &    &              = & 0 \\\\*[1 mm ] \\cdots             &    &                  &    &      &          &    &              = & 0 \\\\*[1 mm ]            &    &                  &    & x_{n-1 } & - & ( 3 + \\lambda ) x_n & = & 0 \\\\*[1 mm ] \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the eigenvalue spectrum is readily evaluated and one finds @xmath103 thus the gap in the spectrum is given for @xmath104 with @xmath105 the other branches can be evaluated similarly , but lead to larger negative eigenvalues .",
    "the rubinstein - duke ( rd ) model is in a way complementary to the necklace model . in the rd model",
    "the dynamical elements are reptons , blobs of monomers of the order of persistence length .",
    "a polymer chain is a string of reptons on a lattice with the constraint that reptons are either in the same cell or in neighboring cells .",
    "there are two types of links between reptons : the _ slack _ links connect two successive reptons in the same cell and the _ taut _ links those in neighboring cells .",
    "a repton can hop to a neigboring cell if it does not leave an empty cell behind .",
    "so the basic mechanism of motion is the interchange of taut and slack links .",
    "the elasticity of the chain is due to storing length through occupation of cells with more than one repton .",
    "the integrity of the chain is guaranteed by the requiring that a connected tube of cells is traced out by the chain .",
    "the natural embedding is in a lattice of dimension @xmath106 , but duke @xcite showed that it suffices to study the projection on the driving field direction . thus the dimension @xmath107 becomes a parameter and the links are characterised by a 3-valued variable : @xmath108 for a slack link , @xmath109 for a taut link in the direction of the field and @xmath110 for a taut link opposite to the field .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 influences the ratio of slack to taut links , but not the universal properties of the chain e.g. the exponents by which the renewal time and the drift velocity depend on the chain length .",
    "so the model is often studied for @xmath111 although the 1-dimensional version is rather artificial @xcite .",
    "sartoni and van leeuwen @xcite noticed that the 1-dimensional version of the rd model could be related to a model with two types of particles .",
    "consider the superposition of two non - interacting 1-dimensional systems of particles .",
    "the particles are called @xmath112 viz . @xmath113 and they hop according to the same rules as the vacancies in the necklace model model .",
    "so they are not allowed to occupy the same site , but , since they are non - interacting , a @xmath112 particle may occupy the same site as a @xmath113 particle .",
    "therefore each site can be in 4 states : empty , occupied by a @xmath112 or a @xmath113 or double occupied , which we indicate by a @xmath114 . in total",
    "there are @xmath115 configurations .",
    "as the two systems do not interact , the probabilities of the combined system are the product of the probabilities of the two systems .",
    "each of them can be treated with the matrix product expansion and yields identical expressions for e.g. the drift velocity .",
    "having the freedom to choose the transition rates of the two systems independently , we drive the @xmath112 particles in one direction and the @xmath113 particles in the opposite direction with equal strength .",
    "then the @xmath112 particles are identified with the links @xmath116 of the rd model and the @xmath113 particles with the links @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath117 and @xmath114 state are both mapped on a slack link @xmath108 .",
    "this gives a contraction of the @xmath115 configurations of the superposition to the @xmath118 configurations of the rd model .",
    "knowing the probability distribution of the combined system one can construct the transition rates in the master equation for the contracted system .",
    "it will in general be a quite involved calculation .",
    "we illustrate it by a simplifying assumption , which is motivated by the following consideration . by reversing the driving field , the role of particles and vacancies",
    "are interchanged .",
    "the system is invariant under a transformation that maps the particles of one component onto the vacancies of the other component . in this map an empty site , which is a vacancy state for both components , maps onto a doubly occupied site .",
    "thus , as we will see , it is reasonable to equate the probabilities for an empty and a doubly occupied site .",
    "before we list the result for the transition rates of this constructed rd model , we note that the underlying combined system has a feature not present in the usual rd models .",
    "if we have a succession of two taut links , it can be a combination of the @xmath117 and @xmath114 state . in that case , one of the particles of the @xmath114 state can move to the empty site , thereby creating a pair of opposite taut links .",
    "this is called the creation of a hernia .",
    "it is not incorporated in the usual rd model , since it is a modification of the tube ( consisting of the set of taut links ) .",
    "similarly the opposite process : a @xmath112 and @xmath113 particle meeting each other on the same site , is the annihilation of a hernia . with this in mind",
    "we come to the following list of transitions .",
    "* transitions of a slack - taut combination .",
    "the slack link corresponds to the 2 states of the @xmath112 and @xmath113 particle system .",
    "each of them can interchange the taut and slack link , so the transition rate is the same .",
    "* transitions of a slack - slack combination .",
    "this corresponds to 4 states of the particles .",
    "two of them can not move : the @xmath119 and the @xmath120 combination .",
    "the two others can create a hernia .",
    "so the hernia creation rate is 1/2 . * hernia annihilation .",
    "a hernia corresponds to a unique particle state and it may develop into a slack - slack pair in two ways : the @xmath112 particle may move or the @xmath113 particle .",
    "so the hernia annihilation rate is 2 . *",
    "a slack end - link .",
    "it has 2 particle configurations , @xmath117 and @xmath114 , and both may move to the taut position , either by creating a particle in the state @xmath117 or by annihilation of a particle in the state @xmath114 .",
    "so the transition rate is 1 . * a taut end - link .",
    "it is a unique particle state and it can transform itself in two ways in a slack state : by annihilation of the particle or by creation a particle of the other kind .",
    "so it has a transition rate 2 .",
    "thus the particle system maps onto a chain with asymmetric transition rates for the end reptons and for the creation and annihilation of hernias .",
    "the other moves are the same as in the rd model .",
    "the model with the above listed transition rules will demonstrate the same behavior as the superposition of the @xmath112 and @xmath113 particles system with opposite driving fields .",
    "although the map is based on a global and not a local symmetry , it is correct in the weak driving field limit .",
    "we have calculated independently the diffusion coefficient and the gap of this model by means of the dmrg method@xcite .",
    "[ compar]a compares the drift velocity with the expression ( [ c13 ] ) , refined with finite size effects ( as can be deduced from @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath121 note that the drift velocity of the rd model is twice the value of the necklace model , since there are two systems of particles moving independently .",
    "[ compar]b does the same for the renewal time and compares it with the expression ( [ e9 ] ) .",
    "as one observes the agreement is perfect .",
    "looking into the numbers one has to conclude that the differences can be made arbitrary small by making the dmrg calculation more accurate .",
    "it proves also that the dmrg method is amazingly accurate in calculating reptating polymer chains .    ) for the necklace model ( a ) .",
    "part ( b ) gives the renewal time of the rd chain with the expression ( [ e9 ] ) deduced from the necklace model.,width=377 ]",
    "we have given an exact solution for the stationary state of the necklace model introduced by guidoni et al . @xcite . also an exact expression is given for the low lying excitations ( gap ) .",
    "this model mimics the reptation of a chain in a 1-dimensional system .",
    "it is not difficult to formulate the model in higher dimensions , but a chain in higher dimensions can not be reconstructed from the position of the vacancies .",
    "moreover , if such a system is driven by a field , the transition rates not only depend on the vacancy distribution , but also on the direction of the connecting links .",
    "so one arrives at a model of the same complexity as the rd model .",
    "the model shows in @xmath111 not the characteristics of the slow reptation behavior .",
    "the drift velocity for long chains approaches a constant rather than decaying with the inverse powers of the length .",
    "the reason is that the model has no obstacles which slow down the drift and the diffusion .",
    "the solution can also be used for a special rd model in @xmath111 , with the possibility of creation and annihilation of hernias .",
    "this shows the importance of the hernias in @xmath111 .",
    "whereas it is believed that hernia creation and annihilation is of minor importance in higher dimension , it plays a decisive role in @xmath111 . without the hernias as a move , the @xmath112 taut links and the @xmath113 taut links",
    "block each other and they are driven towards each other . a hernia annihilation followed by a creation of a pair of taut links in the opposite order ,",
    "allows them to pass each other .",
    "so the hernias , which are very abundant in @xmath111 , effectively remove the obstacles , which are characteristic for the rd model .",
