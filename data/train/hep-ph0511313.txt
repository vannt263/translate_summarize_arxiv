    "the physics of neutrinos is entering the precision era , where laboratory sources from reactors or accelerators are progressively replacing the natural ones ( solar and atmospheric neutrinos ) for the detailed determination of mixing angles and mass splittings .",
    "a parallel development is expected with the opening of a new observational window in astrophysics by the next generation of high - energy neutrino telescopes  @xcite .",
    "the hope is that these instruments will finally shed light on several open problems in cosmic - ray and gamma - ray astrophysics .",
    "it is well recognized that the value of neutrino oscillation parameters has a great impact on the expected fluxes .",
    "we just mention here that significant @xmath0 fluxes from astrophysical sources are implied by the large mixing in the @xmath1@xmath0 sector , opening the interesting possibility to identify @xmath0 events in both optical cherenkov telescopes and in extensive air - shower experiments  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", high - energy neutrinos are expected to come mainly from pion decays , with a flavor composition of @xmath2 at the source .",
    "( we denote with @xmath3 the combined flux of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . ) presently favored ranges for mixing parameters imply oscillated fluxes at the detector @xmath7 approximately in the ratios @xmath8 , almost independently from the details of neutrino mixing parameters  @xcite .",
    "astrophysical uncertainties and the expected low statistics would not justify deeper studies .",
    "this qualitative argument probably explains why the potential for neutrino mixing studies has remained largely unexplored .",
    "however , the possibility to exploit the flavor content of neutrino fluxes for astrophysical diagnostics has been recently analyzed in greater detail . a change in neutrino flavor fluxes",
    "was shown to be important for diagnostics of gamma ray bursts ( grb )  @xcite . as another example",
    ", the fraction of neutrinos produced in high - energy accelerators via the strongly isospin - asymmetric @xmath9 process ( as opposed to @xmath10 inelastic scattering ) might also be measurable , at least around energies of 6.3 pev (  1  pev@xmath1110@xmath12ev )  @xcite .",
    "this idea is based on the fact that at this energy optical cherenkov telescopes have an enhanced efficiency to single out @xmath13 showers , because of the glashow resonant process @xmath14 .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 of such events to the @xmath1 plus @xmath16 charged current tracks in the same energy bin is a suitable observable to that purpose .",
    "the ratio @xmath15 was shown to have a significant sensitivity to the mixing angles as well , in particular to the 1 - 2 mixing angle @xmath17  @xcite . in that respect ,",
    "we also have discussed an interesting astrophysical target  @xcite .",
    "neutron primaries generated in the photo - dissociation of nuclei ( see e.g.  @xcite ) would have the right properties to explain the excess of high - energy cosmic rays from the galactic plane at @xmath18  ev , reported in  @xcite .",
    "if this model is correct , the initial flavor content of the neutrino flux from some galactic regions is close to @xmath19 .",
    "a sensitivity to @xmath20 and to the leptonic cp - phase @xmath21 is achieved via the quantity @xmath22 , that can be deduced in a neutrino telescope from the ratio of track to shower events  @xcite   approaches the ratio of track to shower events in the limit in which sub - leading neutral - currrent events are neglected , and if both channels are detected with the same efficiency .",
    "typical size of track to shower ratio is of several , since the km - long muon range ensures a larger effective target volume for the tracks .",
    "this is however a technical point inessential to our considerations , since it could be accounted for in refined predictions and for a specific experimental setup . ] .",
    "however , though physically plausible , this source is not guaranteed .",
    "the very existence of a significant anisotropy  at least towards the galactic center  is currently debated , in the light of the negative results of an analysis of preliminary auger data  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we generalize previous considerations arguing that : ( i ) there could be neutron beam sources invisible to cosmic ray ( an-)isotropy observations , and only detectable indirectly at neutrino telescopes .",
    "( ii )  other candidate targets useful for neutrino mixing studies at neutrino telescopes also exist , like muon - damped @xmath1 sources from pion decays , that were recently discussed  @xcite .",
    "we shall motivate that both classes of sources could be not only identified at neutrino telescopes , but also used to infer non - trivial information on certain neutrino mixing parameters in a _ model - independent way _",
    ", i.e. irrespective of astrophysical uncertainties .",
    "the argument still holds when presently allowed ranges for the other mixing parameters are taken into account .",
    "in particular , we shall show how a robust lower bound on @xmath23 could be established , and thus a value of @xmath24 identified .",
    "note that this information is non - trivial .",
    "the present 2@xmath25 range is @xmath26  @xcite and a deviation from maximal mixing would be important for flavor symmetries and neutrino mass models  @xcite .",
    "of course , our considerations could be invalidated if exotic mechanisms like neutrino decays are effective  @xcite , but such scenarios seem to be at least disfavored by cosmological bounds  @xcite .    in section  [ extension ]",
    "we treat generic neutron beam sources and focus on the octant of @xmath23 as a model - independent parameter possibly accessible at neutrino telescopes . in section  [ mudamp ]",
    "similar considerations are developed for a pure @xmath27 beam from pion decay . in section [ concl ]",
    "we conclude .",
    "neutrino fluxes detectable at neutrino telescopes , i.e. at @xmath280.11  tev , might well originate in the decay of few  pev neutrons from sources which have characteristics similar to the ones detailed in  @xcite , but whose neutron spectrum cuts - off at energies @xmath29 ev . since the decay length of a neutron is @xmath3010 pc @xmath31 , and typical galactic distances are of order 10 kpc , such a source would not show up as a cosmic ray anisotropy .",
    "the decay protons would rapidly lose directional information via deflection in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the dominance of nuclei in the galactic cosmic ray spectrum is likely starting just above @xmath32ev , and the spectrum of galactic cosmic rays is expected to extend at least up to few@xmath33ev ( see e.g.  @xcite and section 3.1 in  @xcite ) : a situation suitable to the neutron beam production is conceivable in many regions of our galaxy .",
    "of course , such `` hidden '' neutron beams could only be revealed by neutrino observations , and are thus constrained only by the direct observational upper bounds at neutrino telescopes .",
    "nonetheless , any standard pion - decay source would produce neutrinos with a ratio @xmath34 ( or larger , see section  [ mudamp ] ) . by observing a ratio @xmath35",
    "significantly lower than 0.5 , one could claim both the discovery of an invisible neutron beam and put constraints on the neutrino mixing parameters , since any `` background '' ( i.e. , any additional flux not sharing the same flavor content ) should push @xmath35 to higher values .",
    "more quantitatively , the flux flavor ratios @xmath36 arriving at the detector are given in terms of the probabilities @xmath37 as @xmath38 , where @xmath3 are the flux ratios at the source .",
    "matter effects are negligible because of the extremely low densities of cosmic environments , and the interference terms sensitive to the mass splittings and to the sign of @xmath21 ( i.e. , the cp - violating terms ) average out because the galactic distances far exceed the experimentally known oscillation lengths .",
    "this also implies that the same probability formulae apply to neutrino and anti - neutrino channels .",
    "one then obtains @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite and greek ( latin ) letters are used as flavor ( mass ) indices . for a neutron beam source , the parameter @xmath35 can be expressed in terms of oscillation probabilities @xmath41 as @xmath42 the last equality following from unitarity , @xmath43 .",
    "an useful approximation for @xmath44 , obtained as first order expansion in the small quantity @xmath45 , is    @xmath46    the extremes of the ratio eq .",
    "( [ rationbeam ] ) for a fixed @xmath17 and @xmath23 are obtained for maximal allowed value of @xmath20 and the cases @xmath47 , as the linear approximation of eq .",
    "( [ nbeam ] ) suggests . in fig",
    "[ octantnb ] it is clearly shown that , also including current 2@xmath25 uncertainties on mixing parameters , observations of an extremely low value for @xmath35 , say @xmath48 , could only be reconciled with @xmath24 .    until now we have focused on neutron beams from galactic sources , because they are motivated targets having a chance of detection . on the other hand",
    ", it should be stressed that extra - galactic sources that have suitable conditions also exist .",
    "even when one turns to the most reliable of the extra - galactic neutrino sources , the cosmogenic neutrino flux , one easily realizes that at energies around @xmath49ev a secondary peak almost purely made of @xmath50 should be present  @xcite .",
    "this is formed after neutron decays , both in the case of proton and heavy nuclei primaries . in the latter case",
    "a relatively larger contribution is expected because of the additional free - neutrons produced in photo - dissociations  @xcite .",
    "of course , this flux is so low that a detection is challenging , and maybe prevented even in principle by the larger contributions from `` canonical '' diffuse fluxes from other extra - galactic sources .",
    "we now turn to another class of sources producing a non - trivial flavor content at neutrino telescopes , i.e. sources optically thick to muons ( lifetime @xmath51s ) but not to pions ( lifetime @xmath52s ) , which would mainly emit neutrinos in the flavor ratios @xmath53 .",
    "such flavor content arises in specific astrophysical models  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for any concrete example of accelerating engine , a transition from @xmath54 to @xmath53 is expected in some energy range .",
    "this follows from the competition between growing decay path - length ( @xmath55 ) and decreasing energy - loss distance with energy . for standard active galactic nuclei models",
    "the transition energy is expected to be quite high , around @xmath56 tev , but it might be as low as @xmath5710 tev for grb .",
    "such a phenomenon could also offer interesting perspectives for grb diagnostics  @xcite .",
    "again , the effect of mixing angles in this case is non - trivial , since the flavor ratio at the earth for a @xmath53 source would depend only on the @xmath1 survival probability as @xmath58 where we used the unitarity condition @xmath59 . for illustrative purpose",
    "we report here a first order expansion of @xmath60 in the small quantity @xmath45 ,    @xmath61+{\\cal o}(\\theta_{13}^2).\\label{pbeam}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ thicknu ] we show that any observation of a ratio @xmath62 would not only point to a muon - damped source , but would also constrain the octant of @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "this result is irrespective of the uncertainties on the other mixing parameters , as well as of known backgrounds from ( undamped ) pion chain or even neutron beams , which could only contribute to lower the value of @xmath35 .",
    "note also that in both figs .",
    "[ octantnb ] and  [ thicknu ] , special regions in the parameter space exist that are only compatible with very specific values of the mixing parameters , and in particular @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for example , if one establishes independently that @xmath63 , a detected value of @xmath64 would only be compatible with a relatively large @xmath20 and a non - vanishing @xmath21 .",
    "the prospects of forthcoming laboratory experiments for the determination of the octant of @xmath23 have been analyzed in  @xcite , and more in general for neutrino oscillation parameters in  @xcite . to give a quantitative example of the possibilities of neutrino telescopes , for a benchmark flux of muon neutrinos of @xmath65gev @xmath66 s@xmath67",
    ", icecube  @xcite could determine the flavor ratio at the 15% level after 1 year  @xcite .",
    "in this case , icecube would be sufficiently sensitive to detect the effects described above .",
    "moderately lower fluxes could be compensated by a larger integration time .",
    "remarkably , in any kind of extraterrestrial flux , even a diffuse one , one could look for an energy range with peculiar flavor ratios .",
    "moreover , adding complementary information from forthcoming laboratory experiments would improve the chances to identify e.g. the effect of @xmath24 at neutrino telescopes .",
    "we have argued that the role of neutrino mixing at high - energy neutrino telescopes is not trivial , and that forthcoming observations are potentially interesting for neutrino mixing phenomenology .",
    "if sources like neutron or pion beams exist , we showed that : ( i )  they can be identified unambiguously at neutrino telescopes ; ( ii )  they may allow a model - independent determination of crucial qualitative features of neutrino mixing parameters , like the octant of @xmath23 or the existence of a non - vanishing @xmath68 sector .    from a complementary perspective ,",
    "accurate laboratory measurements of neutrino mixing parameters are of primary importance to perform astrophysical diagnostics : since the flux flavor ratios depend on mixing angles , degeneracies with astrophysical parameters may arise .",
    "for example , although the main emphasis in  @xcite was on the sensitivity of the ratio @xmath15 to @xmath17 ( which is relatively well determined from solar neutrino experiments ) , we remark that varying @xmath20 in the allowed experimental range can have an impact as large as @xmath69 on @xmath15 .",
    "this effect alone might affect the extraction of astrophysical parameters .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we have conservatively assumed that only the ratio @xmath35 can be determined at neutrino telescopes . at energies larger than a few pev , and in particular around 6.3 pev where the observable @xmath15 can be used",
    ", one might expect to measure or to constrain the @xmath70 flavor fraction as well , since @xmath0-specific signatures such as lolly - pop or double bang events can be detected  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the chance for a multi - channel observation offers a more powerful tool .",
    "we conclude that the usual assumption of a canonical flavor equipartition at neutrino telescopes is too simplistic : peculiar astrophysical sources may offer complementary constraints to laboratory measurements or , conversely , a more accurate experimental determination of mixing parameters may help to shed light on the properties of cosmic accelerators . after the pioneering era of the discovery of the solar neutrino deficit and of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , observations at the highest energies will be sensitive to new astrophysical sources , that might still offer opportunities for neutrino oscillation studies .",
