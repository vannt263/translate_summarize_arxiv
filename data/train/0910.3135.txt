    ", we shall derive formulas for the number of elements of @xmath0 which bi - avoid various sets of patterns of length 2 .",
    "in particular , we prove bijectively ( see theorem  [ cat ] ) that the number of permutations in @xmath114 simultaneously bi - avoiding ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) and ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) is given by the @xmath115-th catalan number @xmath116 .",
    "in this section , we shall consider bi - avoidance with respect to patterns of length 2 .",
    "up to the equivalence induced by the reversal and complement maps for permutations and words , we need only consider 2 patterns , ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) and ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) .",
    "we start by considering the pattern @xmath117 .",
    "[ mult ] the number of permutations in @xmath0 bi - avoiding ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) is given by @xmath118    we first observe that elements of different colors are independent in permutations bi - avoiding ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) , meaning that no two elements with different colors can form a prohibited configuration .",
    "thus , assuming we have @xmath119 elements of color @xmath120 , @xmath121 , we can choose how to place these colors to form a word @xmath36 in @xmath122 ways .",
    "then we can choose the sets of elements @xmath123 from @xmath124 which will correspond to the colors @xmath125 in @xmath20 in @xmath122 ways .",
    "finally , in order to construct @xmath55 which bi - avoids the prohibited pattern , we must place the elements of @xmath126 in the positions which are colored @xmath24 in decreasing order .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mult ] suggests an obvious generalization for patterns of arbitrary length with all possible dashes whose elements are all colored by 0 :    [ mult1 ] let @xmath127 be a pattern containing dashes in all places .",
    "the number of permutations in @xmath0 bi - avoiding ( @xmath127,0  @xmath1280 ) is given by @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the number of permutations in @xmath131 avoiding @xmath127 .",
    "a proof here is essentially the same as the proof of theorem  [ mult ] , except we can place @xmath24 elements of a permutation in @xmath0 of the same color in any of @xmath130 ways .",
    "it is well known that the number of @xmath73-permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3 with dashes everywhere is given by the _ @xmath73-th catalan number _ @xmath132 . as a corollary to theorem  [ mult1 ]",
    ", we have that for any pattern @xmath127 of length 3 with two dashes , the number of permutations in @xmath133 bi - avoiding ( @xmath127,0  0  0 ) is given by @xmath134    one can generalize even further theorems  [ mult ] and  [ mult1 ] , by talking on distribution of patterns . indeed , assuming we know the number @xmath135 of @xmath24-permutations containing @xmath120 occurrences of a pattern @xmath127 ( with dashes everywhere ) , we can write down the number of permutations in @xmath0 with @xmath120 bi - occurrence of ( @xmath127,0  @xmath1280 ) : @xmath136 for example , the distribution of the pattern 1 - 2 is the same as the distribution of _ inversions _ in permutations ( which coincides with the distribution of 2 - 1 ) , so one can extract the numbers @xmath135 as the coefficients to @xmath137 in @xmath138 and substitute them in the last formula to get the distribution of the number of bi - occurrences of ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) in @xmath0 .",
    "next we consider the pattern ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) in the case where @xmath139 .",
    "the number of permutations in @xmath3 bi - avoiding ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) is shown in  @xcite to be equal to @xmath140 .",
    "however , in theorem  [ pat2 ] below we provide an independent derivation of the exponential generating function in this case .",
    "[ pat2 ] the exponential generating function for the number of permutations in @xmath3 bi - avoiding the pattern ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) is given by @xmath141    let @xmath142 denote the number of @xmath73-permutations in @xmath3 bi - avoiding the pattern ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) . if an @xmath115-permutation contains the element 1 colored by the color 1 , then there are no restrictions for placing this element , thus giving @xmath143 possibilities .",
    "on the other hand , if an @xmath115-permutation @xmath55 contains the element 1 colored by the color 0 in position @xmath144 , then if @xmath55 is to bi - avoid ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) , then every element to the right of 1 must be colored with color 0 and these elements can be arranged in any of @xmath145 ways . moreover , it immediately follows that no instance of a bi - occurrence of ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) exists where the first element is to the left of 1 , and the second is to the right of 1 .",
    "thus it follows that @xmath55 bi - avoids ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) if and only if there is no bi - occurrence of ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) in @xmath146 .",

    "we obtain @xmath148 multiplying both parts of the equation above by @xmath149 and summing over all @xmath150 , we have @xmath151 leading to the differential equation @xmath152 with the initial condition @xmath153 as the empty permutation bi - avoids ( 1 - 2,0  1 ) . the solution to this differential equation",

    "it follows that @xmath304 which is equivalent to ( [ uordinarygf ] ) .",

    "we prove the statement by establishing a bijection between the objects in question of length @xmath73 and the _",
    "dyck paths _ of semi - length @xmath115 known to be counted by the catalan numbers ( a dyck path of semi - length @xmath73 is a lattice path from ( 0,0 ) to @xmath306 with steps ( 1,1 ) and @xmath307 that never goes below @xmath86-axis ) .",
    "suppose @xmath308 .",
    "note that @xmath20 must bi - avoid the pattern 1 - 2 - 3 , as in an occurrence of such pattern in @xmath20 , there are two letters of the same color leading to an occurrence of ( 1 - 2,0  0 ) .",
    "thus , the structure of @xmath20 , as it is well - known , is two decreasing sequences shuffled .",
    "subdivide @xmath20 into so called _ reverse irreducible components_. a reverse irreducible component is a factor @xmath309 of @xmath20 of minimal length such that everything to the left ( resp .",

    "this is easy to see , that any singleton element in @xmath20 can have any color ( either 0 or 1 ) .",
    "we will now show that the color of each element of a non - singleton block is uniquely determined .",
    "indeed , irreducibility of a single block means that two decreasing sequences in the structure of ( 1 - 2 - 3)-avoiding permutations are the block s sequence of left - to - right minima and the block s sequence of right - to - left maxima which do _ not _ overlap .",
    "thus , for any left - to - right minimum element @xmath86 ( except possibly the last element ) , one has an element @xmath87 greater than @xmath86 to the right of it inside the same block and vice versa , from which we conclude that @xmath86 must receive color 1 , whereas @xmath87 must receive color 0 ( otherwise a prohibited pattern will bi - occur ) .",
