    "high - gain targets for the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) are meant for the ignition in a small part of a fuel with the following propagation of the thermonuclear burn wave on its main part .",
    "as the deuterium  tritium ( dt ) reaction rate at the temperatures of about 10  kev is much greater than the rates of other thermonuclear reactions , the ignition of the equimolar dt mixture is considered commonly as the primary task .",
    "there are two approaches to icf .",
    "one of the two is based on compression of a spherical layer of the fuel by a single driver providing sufficiently high values of density and temperature @xcite . at that",
    ", the thermonuclear burn wave arises in the target volume .",
    "another approach known as the fast ignition is based on using two drivers @xcite .",
    "the first driver compresses the target up to necessary value of density , while the second driver provides for fast rise of temperature . as a variant of such approach",
    ", one can consider ignition at the target center by a converging shock wave @xcite .",
    "a possibility of using multi - shock wave compression for fast ignition is considered by @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the variant of the fast ignition for which the burn wave arises near the target surface and propagates inside the target .",
    "laser - generated beams of electrons @xcite , and ions @xcite as well as heavy ion beams @xcite , macroparticles @xcite and high velocity flows of matter @xcite are considered as a driver for the fast heat of the highly - compressed fuel",
    ". results of many theoretical works show initiation of burn waves propagating inside the target at certain values of beam parameters .",
    "the contemporary concept of fast ignition assumes that the fuel is compressed up to the initial density @xmath16 , where @xmath2 is the density of the dt - mixture solid state at atmospheric pressure and temperature of 4  k. such preliminary compression of the fuel is a serious technical problem due to , particularly , rayleigh  taylor instability @xcite arising at the stage of deceleration of a heavy shell while compressing the fuel . in the present paper , we study a possibility to use targets with the fuel density @xmath17 . in this connection ,",
    "the work by @xcite should be mentioned , where propagation of thermonuclear detonation on unevenly compressed and heated non - spherical target is studied numerically , in particular , from a small part of the hot ( @xmath18  kev ) and dense ( @xmath19 ) dt mixture to a cold and much less compressed part ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the first theoretical estimate of the ignition energy threshold for dt fuel of the density @xmath21 was obtained by @xcite in the form @xmath22 . the similar estimate with an improved value of the constant of proportionality",
    "was obtained by @xcite . in many papers ( see , for example ,",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the ignition energy threshold is determined from numerical solutions of the 2d axially symmetric problem with given radius and time dependencies of the particle beam intensity .",
    "the improved dependency @xmath23 based on results of many computations for @xmath24  g/@xmath25 is proposed by @xcite .",
    "note also a number of simple burn models based on ordinary differential equations of evolution , which allow estimating of ignition parameters for uniformly heated volumes of fuel @xcite .    in the following works , shell cylindrical targets with dt pre - compressed fuel irradiated from the target end are studied using 2d numerical codes .",
    "the initiation of a thermonuclear burn wave in dt fuel of the density about @xmath26 by a heavy ion beam was considered by @xcite . a possibility to decrease the ignition energy by heating a small part of the fuel near the symmetry axis before the fuel density reaches its maximal value",
    "was considered by @xcite .",
    "propagation of thermonuclear burn waves within a gold shell for dt fuel density of 50 , 100 and 200 g/@xmath15 , as well as the ignition of such a target by heavy ion beams were considered by @xcite .",
    "symmetrically converging plane thermonuclear burn waves initiated by laser pulses for the initial density @xmath27 and @xmath28 have been studied by @xcite using the model of total absorption of laser radiation in the point with the critical density . for such kind of model ,",
    "epithermal particles generated by laser - plasma interaction and heating the domain of supercritical density are ignored .",
    "a slow combustion wave arises only after at least one interaction of the shock wave reflected from the symmetry plane with the ablation front and moves in the fuel preliminary compressed and heated by several shock waves .",
    "the slow wave generates before itself a compression velocity profile that increases rapidly the fuel density . as a result",
    ", the slow combustion wave can transform into two detonation waves moving in opposite directions .",
    "after reflecting the slow or detonation wave from the symmetry plane , the intensive burning continues and increases considerably the burn - up factor of the target .",
    "further @xcite , the study of thermonuclear burn waves at @xmath27 and @xmath28 was supplemented by the waves generated by proton beams .",
    "it was shown that in spite of different ways of ignition , various models of @xmath5-particle heat , whether the burn wave remains slow or transforms into the detonation wave , and regardless of way of such a transformation , the final value of the burn - up factor depends essentially on the only parameter @xmath29 , as in the known approximate formulas for the fuel expansion in spherical geometry @xcite .        in the present paper",
    ", we extend our study to the more wide range of the initial density @xmath30 .",
    "the 1d problem to be considered can be treated as a rough model of burning the target shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the fuel of the initial density @xmath21 is in the cylindrical channel with the length of @xmath0 surrounded by a shell of a heavy material .",
    "following , for example , @xcite , the monoenergetic beam of protons of kinetic energy 1  mev is considered as the ignition driver .",
    "the beam intensity is 10@xmath31  w/@xmath4 and the duration is 50  ps .",
    "the beam of the same energy with the intensity 10@xmath32  w/@xmath4 and the duration 500  ps is also considered .",
    "the burn - up factor and the gain obtained from the 1d calculation should be considered as the maximum possible values for the target of the same initial density and length .",
    "for the first time such type of target was suggested by @xcite for compression of a gaseous deuterium by laser pulses .",
    "note that the target was experimentally studied by @xcite .",
    "the heavy shell can be compressed by a magnetic field @xcite or by heavy ions depositing energy to a certain shell of a multilayer target @xcite .",
    "so we suppose that it is possible to create the configuration close to that shown in figure [ fig1 ] with a cylinder of the fuel compressed to the necessary density and with two holes for injecting the proton beams .",
    "let us assume that the key effect determining the fuel ignition is the heat by @xmath5-particles while the lateral expansion of the fuel , the heat transfer from the fuel to the shell and the self - radiation of plasma are insignificant .",
    "such assumption has certain grounds . for the initial density @xmath33  g/@xmath15",
    ", the shell density in its compression can exceed the above value more than 10 times .",
    "for example , @xcite considered the gold shell with a density of 400  g/@xmath15 . for the time 150  ps , during which a detonation wave arises in our calculations ( see section [ ignition ] )",
    ", the fuel radius in the target can be changed insignificantly . in the case of compression by a strong magnetic field , the heat flux between the fuel and the shell",
    "can be essentially diminished @xcite .",
    "finally , we refer to the work by @xcite , where the ignition of a similar target by a heavy ion beam is simulated numerically .",
    "the authors conclude that the radiative transfer is not determinative when the ignition .",
    "if the above assumption is true , there is an interesting possibility to evaluate the ignition energy of the cylindrical target @xmath11 using 1d calculations . to ignite the target ,",
    "it is necessary to leave a significant part of the @xmath5-particles energy within the fuel . to determine approximately the ignition energy of the cylindrical target in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath34 and solve the 1d problem taking into account the escape of @xmath5-particles from a cylinder of the radius @xmath34 identifying the latter with the beam and the fuel radiuses .",
    "if the solution of the 1d problem contains the thermonuclear burn wave , we set @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the proton beam energy inserted at the time @xmath37 per unit of cross - sectional area @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the beam intensity given in the 1d problem .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath5-particles are relying straight lines .",
    "a possibility to use strongly magnetized cylindrical shells confining the trajectories of @xmath5-particles and therefore reducing the beam area necessary for the ignition @xcite is not considered here . for simulation of @xmath5-particle transport",
    "we use the track method @xcite and its modification that is a numerical method for the known cauchy problem for the kinetic steady - state homogeneous equation in fokker ",
    "plank approximation @xcite .",
    "the argument in favor of the quasi-1d model described above is its qualitative agreement with theoretical estimates and numerical simulations of the fuel ignition by the particle beam of the radius much less than the fuel size .",
    "apart from numerical results presented in section [ integ - char ] , one can see such agreement from the following simple reasoning .",
    "the mean free - path length of @xmath5-particles during the isochoric heating is about @xmath40 .",
