    "solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) have drawn a great deal of attention as robust nonlinear matter - wave pulses .",
    "bright ( localized ) solitons were first experimentally created in an effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) condensate of @xmath3li , loaded in a strongly elongated ( nearly one - dimensional )  cigar - shaped \" trap @xcite .",
    "the use of the feshbach resonance ( fr ) made it possible to keep the scattering length in the condensate negative , with a very small absolute value , @xmath4 nm .",
    "the weak self - attractive nonlinearity controlled by means of this technique was sufficient to create 1d solitons , being a way below the collapse threshold in the cigar - shape configuration , thus securing the stability of the solitons .",
    "more generic for bec is a positive scattering length , corresponding to repulsive interactions between atoms . in this case ,",
    "bright solitons may be created as a result of the interplay of the intrinsic repulsion and periodic potential induced by an optical lattice ( ol , i.e. , the interference pattern created by counterpropagating beams illuminating the condensate ) .",
    "it was predicted @xcite that _ gap solitons _ ( gss ) may emerge in bandgaps of the system s spectrum , since the interplay of a _ negative _ effective mass , appearing in a part of the gap , with the repulsive interaction is exactly what is needed to create a bright soliton .",
    "theoretical models for gss in bec were reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a rigorous stability analysis for them was developed in ref .",
    "experimentally , a gs in the @xmath5rb condensate with a positive scattering length , loaded into a cigar - shaped trap equipped with a longitudinal ol , was for the first time created in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the soliton was composed of @xmath6 atoms ) .",
    "binary mixtures of becs are also available to experimental studies .",
    "most typically , they contain two different hyperfine states of the same atomic species , such as @xmath5rb @xcite and @xmath7na @xcite .",

    "mixture of @xmath8k and @xmath5rb @xcite . as mentioned above , the magnitude and sign of the scattering lengths of collisions between atoms in the same species may be altered , via the fr technique , by an external spatially uniform magnetic @xcite or optical @xcite field .",
    "the scattering length of collisions between atoms belonging to different species may also be controlled by the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility opens a way to create a binary mixture with the ( natural ) intra - species repulsion , while the sign of the inter - species interaction is switched to attraction . in recent preprints @xcite ,",
    "it was proposed to use this possibility to create _",
    "symbiotic _ bright solitons : while each self - repulsive species can not support a soliton by itself , the inter - species attraction opens a way to make two - component solitons . a somewhat similar possibility was earlier proposed in terms of a bose - fermi mixture , where the interaction between bosons is repulsive , but the bosons and fermions attract each other @xcite .",
    "related to the latter setting , is a proposal to use attraction between fermions and bosons to built bosonic quantum dots for fermions ( in particular , gap solitons in the bec trapped in an ol may play the role of such quantum dots ) @xcite .    in the present work , the aim to construct 2d and 1d solutions for two - component gss in the most natural setting , when the inter - species interaction is repulsive .",
    "we will chiefly focus on the basic case , when intra - species interactions may be completely neglected , while the interplay of the ol potential and repulsion between the two species help to build gss .",
    "the actual possibility to nullify the intra - species scattering length by means of the fr depends on the atomic species : as is known , it can be done in @xmath3li ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while in @xmath5rb loss effects grow close to the fr point .",
    "another possibility is offered by spinor condensates , where the scattering lengths which determine collisions between atoms with the same or opposite values of the hyperfine spin , @xmath9 , can be represented , respectively , as @xcite @xmath10 , the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath11 accounting for the mean - field ( spin - independent ) and spin - exchange interactions between the atoms . in this case ,",
    "the self - scattering length vanishes in the case of @xmath12 .    besides that",
    ", the model with zero interaction inside each species and repulsion between them may also apply to a mixture of two ultra - cold fermi gases @xcite . in this connection , it is relevant to mention that the scattering length of collisions between fermionic atoms ( such as @xmath13li ) may also be controlled by means of the fr @xcite .",
    "an effect of the intra - species repulsion will be briefly considered too , with a conclusion that it additionally stabilizes two - component gss .",

    "as seen from panel ( c ) of the figure , the stability area of the inter - gap solitons is essentially smaller than in the case of their intra - gap counterparts , cf .",
    "[ fig0ilya](c ) .",
    "note that panels ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in fig . [ fig1ilya ] do not show a bloch band that separates the two gaps ( unlike fig .",
    "[ graph_3d_ep10 ] in the 2d model ) , as the ranges of values on the axes of @xmath39 and @xmath113 in these panels cover , respectively , only the first and second gaps .",
    "it is noteworthy that , as well as in the 2d model , the inter - gap solitons are bound states of tb and lb components belonging to the first and second gaps , respectively .",
    "an example of a stable inter - gap soliton that clearly demonstrates this structure is shown in fig . [ fig1ilya](d ) [ cf . figs .",
    "[ va_vs_num_n50_ep10](d ) and ( e ) and fig .",
    "[ num_ep4 ] , which display cross sections of intra - gap solitons in the 2d model ] .    if an inter - gap soliton is unstable , its instability again has the oscillatory character .",
    "however , the action of the instability on the inter - gap soliton is more destructive than it was in the case of its intra - gap counterpart : instead of transforming the stationary soliton into a well - localized breather [ see fig . [ fig0ilya](d ) ] , the instability triggers much more violent evolution , as illustrated by a typical example in fig .",
    "[ fig2ilya ] .",
    "one - dimensional intra - gap solitons belonging to the second gap were constructed and investigated too , with a conclusion that they all are _ unstable _ , although the instability growth rate may sometimes be very small .",
    "an example illustrating the instability of this species of the gs is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3ilya ] .",
    "this conclusion seems to be in contrast with results reported above for the 2d model , where a small stability area for the intra - gap solitons appertaining to the second finite bandgap was found , see fig .",
    "[ graph_3d_ep10 ] .",
    "however , the stability of the 2d solitons was identified not via eigenfrequencies of small perturbations , but rather by means of direct simulations , and the numerical stability test always turned the stationary soliton into a weakly excited state ( a breather with a small amplitude of intrinsic vibrations ) .",
    "therefore ( as it was said above ) , in the 2d case we , strictly speaking , can not tell a difference between a weakly unstable stationary soliton and a weakly excited stable breather into which the dynamical evolution may transform the unstable soliton .",
    "thus , it may happen that what was identified as stable 2d intra - gap solitons sitting in the second finite bandgap are , actually , stable breathers with a small vibration amplitude , similar to what is observed in fig . [ fig0ilya](d ) .",
    "we have also investigated in some detail the effect of the self - repulsion term in the full 1d system ( [ model1d ] ) . as was already mentioned above in connection to the 2d model",
    ", the increase of the self - repulsion coefficient @xmath32 leads to stabilization of the gss . a similar effect in the 1d setting",
    "is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4ilya ] .",
    "it demonstrates that a stable symmetric intra - gap soliton belonging to the second finite bandgap , which , as said above , is always unstable in the 1d model with @xmath35 , becomes stable if @xmath32 exceeds a minimum ( threshold ) value , which , in this case , is @xmath114 .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ model1d ] ) ] . except for @xmath115 , parameters are the same as in the previous figure .",
    "the soliton is stable in the region of @xmath116.,width=384 ]    the above stability analysis was performed within the framework of the gpe , i.e. , in the mean - field approximation at zero temperature .",
    "a physically important issue is stability of the same solitons against quantum and thermal fluctuations beyond the framework of the mean - field theory .",
    "the interest to this issue is enhanced by experimental observation of quite strong effective re - thermalization the ultra - cold condensate under the action of the ol potential @xcite . to extend the analysis in this direction",
    ", one may use a system of self - consistent time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( tdhfb )  equations , built around the corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation(s ) @xcite .",
    "this approach was recently used to demonstrate possible instability of an ordinary 1d soliton ( not of the gap type ) in the bec with attractive interactions , which is completely stable in the framework of the gpe proper @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the instability splits the soliton into two segments .",
    "a properly modified system of the tdhfb equations ( including the ol potential and repulsive inter - species interaction ) can also be used for the investigation of the extended stability of the two - component gss studied in this work .",
    "we have performed a preliminary analysis along these lines , and concluded that those 1d solitons which are stable within the framework of eqs .",
    "( [ model1d ] ) are also stable ( at least , in most cases ) against fluctuations governed by the tdhfb equations .",
    "a systematic consideration of this issue , especially for the 2d model , requires a considerable amount of additional work and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in this work , we have introduced a model of a binary bec with intrinsic inter- and intra - species repulsion ( positive scattering lengths ) , which is loaded into the periodic optical - lattice potential . both two- and",
    "one - dimensional versions of the model were considered .",
    "we focused on the most fundamental case ( different from previously studied models ) , with repulsion between the two species and zero intra - species interaction , which can be achieved by means of the feshbach - resonance ( fr )  technique , or in a spinor condensate .",
    "the same system may also model a mixture of two mutually repulsive fermionic species .",
    "the main problem was the existence and stability of gap solitons ( gss ) supported by the interplay of the inter - species repulsion and periodic potential .",
    "two - component gss were looked for by means of the variational approximation ( va ) and in the numerical form .",
    "it was found that the va provides for good accuracy in the case when the 2d soliton is a bound state of two tightly - bound components , each being essentially confined around one cell of the periodic potential .",
    "such a gs structure dominates in the case when both components belong to the first finite bandgap of the system s spectrum ( the intra - gap soliton ) .",
    "in fact , only this type of the gs is possible in a weak 2d lattice potential . on the contrary ,",
    "inter - gap solitons , and intra - gap ones residing in the second finite bandgap ( both types are possible in a stronger lattice potential , with the barrier height essentially larger than the recoil energy ) are , typically , bound states of tightly- and loosely - bound components . for such structures ,",
    "the va is irrelevant , but general results were obtained in the numerical form , which made it possible to identify the existence and stability regions for the inter- and intra - gap solitons in both the 2d and 1d models . in the 2d case",
    ", the stability was tested in direct simulations , while in the 1d model the stability was identified in a rigorous way , through the computation of eigenfrequencies of small perturbations ( the results were also verified by direct simulations ) . in the case",
    "when the 1d intra - gap soliton belonging to the first gap is weakly unstable , it evolves into a stable breather with a small amplitude of intrinsic vibrations .",
    "in contrast to this , if the 2d solitons in the first gap are unstable , they are completely destroyed by the instability .",
    "the same pertains to unstable 1d and 2d solitons of other types , such as inter - gap solitons , and intra - gap ones belonging to the second finite bandgap .",
    "it was also shown that introduction of the intra - species repulsion , in addition to the repulsion between the components , leads to further stabilization of solitons .",
    "in particular , some originally unstable types ( such as 1d intra - gap solitons in the second bandgap ) may be made stable , provided that the self - repulsion coefficient exceeds a certain minimum value .",
    "preliminary analysis shows that the two - component gss introduced in this work are stable too against fluctuations obeying the hartree - fock - bogoliubov equations .",
    "the actual number of atoms in the 2d solitons considered above , which is their most important physical characteristic , can be easily estimated .",
    "undoing renormalizations which led to the 2d gross - pitaevskii equations in the form of eqs .",
    "( [ model ] ) and making use of eq .",
    "( [ numbers ] ) , one can derive the following relations between the density of atoms in physical units , @xmath117 , and the rescaled one @xmath118 , and between the number of atoms and the soliton s norm : @xmath119where @xmath120 is the period of the optical lattice , @xmath121 the scattering length of the inter - species collisions , and @xmath122 the size of the condensate in the transverse ( @xmath123 ) direction ( note that the relation between @xmath124 and @xmath74 does not contain @xmath120 ) .",
    "assuming experimentally reasonable values , @xmath125 nm and @xmath126 @xmath127 m ( the latter pertains to a ",

    ", this number may be made at least an order of magnitude larger , reducing @xmath121 by means of the fr technique @xcite .",
