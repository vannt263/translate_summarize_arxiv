    "755 is a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) and black hole candidate located in the direction of the galactic center .",
    "it was first discovered by the _ uhuru _",
    "satellite s all - sky x - ray survey in 1970 @xcite with a flux of @xmath2jy .",
    "the x - ray source remained bright and persistent until january 1996 , when the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( ) failed to detect the source while in its off state with a flux of @xmath3jy @xcite .",
    "the source has remained quiescent since then , to the time of writing .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 755 indicates that the primary may be a black hole .",
    "the spectrum was observed to be `` ultrasoft '' ( @xmath4 2 kev ) when the source was bright @xcite , and a hard x - ray tail above @xmath5 kev was observed by @xcite ; both spectral aspects are frequently observed for black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noted the appearance of an iron emission line centered around 6.7 kev , as found in many black hole candidates @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart of 755 was identified as a faint , blue star with a featureless spectrum by @xcite .",
    "when the x - ray source was active , the optical counterpart was a v@xmath61819 mag object . since turning off , the counterpart has dimmed to v @xmath7 22 @xcite .",
    "a regular , periodic dipping in the x - ray light curve of the source was observed by @xcite , suggesting that the source is being observed at a high inclination angle .",
    "this periodicity also allowed for the determination of the 4.4 hr orbital period of the binary @xcite , a result confirmed by the photometric variations in the optical counterpart by @xcite .",
    "this period , along with the period - mass relation @xcite , suggests a mass of @xmath6 0.5  for the secondary star . the distance to this source",
    "is thought to be between 49 kpc @xcite .    in 2003 , @xcite reported the  discovery of an x - ray - emitting jetlike feature that is 7 in extent , narrow , and centered at the position of 755 .",
    "they suggest that it has existed since the source entered quiescence .",
    "the 35 half - length of the jet corresponds to 4  pc for an assumed distance of 4  kpc .",
    "thus , as @xcite note , it is plausible that a relativistic jet could have expanded to this length , given that the source was active for at least 25 years .",
    "they also report the existence of a hole developing near the lmxb , which is consistent with the scenario that the source has not been feeding the jet during the past eight years of quiescence .",
    "although jets are not seen exclusively in black holes binaries , they are relatively common in such systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "confirmation that this extended x - ray emission feature is a true jet would provide further evidence that 755 may contain a black hole primary . in this letter",
    ", we present a  observation of 755 and report on the diffuse appearance of the jetlike feature .",
    "we observed 755 with the _ chandra _ x",
    "- ray observatory on 2003 september 25 from 17:21:18 to 23:51:50 ut , with 21909 s of good time exposure .",
    "the incoming x - ray flux was read out by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) with the very faint format in timed exposure mode . at the time of the proposal ,",
    "it was not known that 755 might have a jetlike feature extending from it , and thus the source was placed at the standard aimpoint near the boundary between nodes 0 and 1 on the acis - s3 ccd chip .",
    "this aimpoint is not at the center of chip , so unfortunately , the s3 ccd did not capture the full length of the region of extended emission . in order to avoid measurement errors due to the very different responses of the s3 and s2 chips",
    ", we chose to only look at acis - s3 , cutting off about 15% of the region in question ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we compare the  data with the  data for the same source , which were taken on 2001 march 8 in a 5 hour exposure using the two epic - mos arrays operated in full frame mode and the epic - pn array in extended full frame mode @xcite .",
    "all three cameras observed the source with the `` medium '' optical blocking filter .",
    "the good time exposure in each camera was 18127 s , 18107 s , and 15359 s for the mos-1 , mos-2 , and pn cameras respectively .",
    "the  data were analyzed using standard processing tools from ciao version 3.0.2 .",
    "no significant flaring was seen in the data , and the response files used were corrected for the gradual degradation in the low - energy response of the acis detector .",
    "we also reanalyzed the  data obtained through the heasarc public data archive using the  science analysis system ( sas ) version 5.4.1 to undertake a proper comparison of the data between the two telescopes . because the pn camera has less uniform coverage due to the gaps between the ccds and bad pixel columns",
    ", we chose to use only the data from the two mos cameras in our analysis .",
    "the difference in sensitivity between these two cameras is modest , and in our results we found that the mos-2 camera yielded greater flux values by at most 15% . for our analysis",
    ", we quote only the average of the two cameras .",
    "the spectra of the data from both  and  were binned to contain a minimum of 15 counts in each channel and analyzed in the 0.37.0 kev band using xspec version 11.2 @xcite .",
    "the region of the jetlike feature was specified to be 7 in length by , and estimated by us to be 06 in width from the  images .",
    "because a feature 7 in length centered on the source does not fit in the  acis - s3 chip , we took the region length to be 6 in our analysis of both the  and  data ( see fig.1 ) so that we could compare the fluxes using the exact same region .",
    "for consistency , we always use the same source and background regions in our analysis of both data sets .",
    "all errors on fluxes reported in this work are 95% confidence errors , errors on counts are at 1@xmath1 , and all other errors are at 90% confidence unless otherwise noted .",
    "in its quiescent state , 755 remained undetected by .",
    "we obtain an upper limit for the flux of the lmxb by finding an average of 1.05 background counts in a 20 radius circle , the size of the aperture that is expected to contain 90% of the flux for an on - axis acis point source at 1.49 kev . a source with less than five counts",
    "has a 3@xmath1 probability of being detected according to poisson statistics ; using a power - law model ( with parameters equal to those we used to analyze the jetlike emission , described in detail below ) with webpimms , this corresponds to a flux upper limit of @xmath8 .      in 2003 ,",
    "reported the detection of a 7jetlike feature of extended emission , centered on the position of 755 and at a position angle of @xmath9 .",
    "755 is located off the galactic plane at ra 17@xmath1058@xmath1140@xmath120 and dec -3348@xmath13270 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , so the emission is not likely to be due to a feature in the plane .",
    "the emission is also found to be symmetric , as expected from a binary source observed at high inclination .",
    "the jetlike feature is very prominent in the  images of angelini and white ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 of their paper ) . in the high - resolution  image , however , the jet is not visually apparent .",
    "the  image provides evidence that the emission may be diffuse : a rectangular area of 06 @xmath16 6enclosing the expected jetlike feature contains many more counts than regions of identical area next to the jet region , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the central region was found to have 1327@xmath1736 counts , which is 4.1 sigma above the region directly to the northeast ( with 1122@xmath1734 counts ) and 5.8 sigma above the region directly to the southwest ( with 1044@xmath1732 counts ) .",
    "the jet region has @xmath18 net counts using the two outer rectangles as the background region .",
    "( the lower 06 of the leftmost rectangle was excluded due to contamination by point source d  see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this background region is used for all analysis in this paper .",
    "( see table 1 for a description of the counts recorded in various regions . )",
    "the local background appears to be relatively independent of location in the  data , whereas there is a significant variation in the  background on the two sides of the central rectangle that contains the source .",
    "spatial variations of this magnitude are frequently observed in acis images .",
    "the standard acis - s3 background dataset from the calibration database ( caldb ) showed the same ratio of variation between the sum of the two leftmost rectangles and the sum of the two rightmost rectangles , suggesting that the variation we see is not specific to our image .",
    "we adopted the simple power - law and thermal bremsstrahlung models used by .",
    "for both models , we froze the hydrogen column density at @xmath19 = @xmath20 @xmath21 , which is the value predicted from h i maps in the direction and at the distance of 755 @xcite , and is similar to the @xmath19 values adopted by others ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . from our best fit power - law model",
    ", we obtained photon indices of @xmath22 for the  data , and @xmath23 for the  data .",
    "these are also consistent with the photon index of @xmath24 found by @xcite using the same value of @xmath19 . in the various models they adopt ,  find photon indices ranging from 1.5 to 1.9 for their jet region , which they note are similar to values observed from other galactic and extragalactic jets associated with black holes . in order to better constrain our model , we chose to freeze the power - law photon index at 1.5 in our determination of the flux .",
    "the temperature was also very poorly constrained in the bremsstrahlung model . because we could not get a precise value for this parameter , and because  report a lower limit of 4 kev in their analysis , we chose to constrain our model by freezing the temperature at 4 kev .",
    "fixing the temperature at 4 kev or at 10 kev returned minimal differences in the fluxes found .",
    "our fits for the normalization parameter generated a reduced @xmath25 of 1.03 and 0.30 for both models in  and , respectively .",
    "the 06 @xmath16 6jet region in the  image yielded an average unabsorbed flux of @xmath26  for the mos-1 and mos-2 cameras and @xmath27  in  in the 0.37.0 kev band with the power - law model .",
    "( see table 2 for a summary of these results and the results from the bremsstrahlung model . )",
    "these fluxes correspond to a luminosity of @xmath28 ergs  s@xmath29 from the  data and @xmath30 ergs  s@xmath29 from the  data .",
    "two bright knotlike regions were found in the  image in the southeastern end of the emission area .",
    "they appear to be broader than the point - spread function ( psf ) of  of 9 in radius at 1.5 kev for a region encircling half of the total energy .",
    "one of these regions was also imaged by _",
    "( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we analyzed this knot , at ra 17@xmath1058@xmath1146@xmath1264 and dec -3349@xmath134948 , using the same models described above .",
    "we selected a 24diameter extraction aperture by comparing the net counts for a series of aperture sizes and noting where the flux fell off most significantly .",
    "the background region used was identical to the one described in our jet analysis .",
    "the knot region had a greater concentration of net counts compared to the net counts in the region of jetlike emission in the  data , but the knot emission was not detected at a significant level in the  data .",
    "recorded @xmath31 net counts in the knot , which , when scaled for area , is greater than the average net counts in the jet region significant to 3.5@xmath1 .",
    "recorded @xmath32 net counts , which is not statistically different than the net counts recorded in the jet region .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.37.0 kev flux with the power - law model yielded an upper limit of @xmath33  from the averaged mos cameras and @xmath34  from the  data .",
    "see table 1 for a description of the counts obtained in the knot region , and table 2 for a summary of the fluxes found obtained from both the power - law and the bremsstrahlung models for the knot region .",
    "the lack of visibility of the knot in  suggests that the object may be diffuse .",
    "we verified this hypothesis by comparing the ratio of the fluxes between the knot and the jet in  and . assuming that @xmath19 and @xmath35 are the same for both the knot and the jet , and that the flux of the knot has not changed significantly in the 2.5 years between the  and  observations , the ratio between the net knot and jet flux in  gives a predicted 30.3 @xmath17 9.0 net counts for the knot in  for the 0.37.0 kev band .",
    "this method of scaling gives a count value for the knot that is different from the actual 12 @xmath17 7.1 net counts of observed in the  image by 1.58 @xmath1 .",
    "choosing harder energy bands makes the knot more significant : in the 4.07.0 kev band , the knot net counts is higher than the jet net counts by 3.0 @xmath17 0.5 ; for the 0.37.0 kev band , the knot is only 1.4 @xmath17 0.4 times higher",
    ". the surface brightness sensitivity of  may be too low to statistically detect the a diffuse knot in the 0.37.0 kev band .",
    "if all of the counts in the knot had been concentrated at a point source , the knot would be significant and immediately apparent in the  image , since the background in a typical 20 radius extraction aperture is only 1.05 counts in the 0.37.0 kev band ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus , we suggest that the observed knot is most likely a real , but diffuse , feature .    likewise , the jetlike emission is also likely a real feature .",
    "the agreement between the  and  fluxes for the jet region suggest that the emission visibly seen in the  data must still be present in the  data . though the  data had slightly longer good time exposure ( @xmath6 22000 s , compared to @xmath6 18100 s for the mos cameras aboard ) , there are other factors that have contributed to the lack of visibility of the jet in , including s greater effective area : at 1.5 kev , the effective area of the mos cameras aboard  is 1400 @xmath36 compared to s 700 @xmath36 .",
    "the background rates are also twice as high with , making significant detections of diffuse emission more difficult .",
    "thus , if the emission were truly diffuse , it would have been more easily detected with the capabilities of the  instruments .",
    "the emission is not likely to be due to an alignment of point sources , as multiple point sources were not found in the emission region by either  or .",
    "six point sources located outside the jet region , which were detected by both  and , are shown in figure 1 with their positions and net counts listed in table 3 .",
    "of course , a large enough assemblage of very faint point sources would have escaped detection as individual sources ( e.g. , 100 or more source with fluxes of @xmath37  or less ) , although this scenario is an unlikely one .",
    "it is important to note that since one of the bright knotlike regions that was detected by  was off the s3 chip of _ chandra _ , a simple scaling of the fluxes found in our analysis of the 06 @xmath16 6region to the estimated true size of the jet of 7may yield a slight underestimate of the actual flux in the region .",
    "however , since we can not analyze the  image with a 7jet , we limited our  analysis to 6regions for more accurate and consistent comparisons between the two telescopes .",
    "while the  image showed many point sources , emission from lmxb 755 in quiescence was not detected .",
    "we present the results of a comparative study using  and  imaging data of a jetlike emission feature that is apparently emanating from 755 . although the jetlike feature is not directly visible in the  image , though highly visible in the  images ,  does detect significant emission ( 46@xmath1 ) from the jet region .",
    "furthermore , we find that the fluxes from the same 06 @xmath16 6jet region as observed by  and  agree within errors .",
    "the flux of a knotlike region embedded in the jet was detected by , but not by  because of s smaller area and higher background .",
    "we show that if this emission were due to a point source , then it would have been easily detected by .",
    "we therefore conclude that the emission from the knot is diffuse .",
    "our analysis shows that the jetlike emission surrounding 755 is likely a true and diffuse jet , which appears to be devoid of point - like regions of emission associated with internal shocks .",
    "because jets evolve very rapidly in our galaxy , compared with the slowly evolving larger scale jets of quasars and agn , studying the jets from 755 and other galactic sources may provide key information in understanding jet formation and propagation .",
