    "most theoretical calculations in quantum chaos using ensemble averaging are restricted only to the leading order consistent with rmt , which probes only the average properties of the system , such as the average escape rate @xmath185 .",

    "for an open system , gaspard and nicolis @xcite have derived an escape rate formula to relate the coefficient of diffusion and the escape rate of large open systems .",

    "the rp resonances are essential ingredients of a description of irreversibility and thermodynamics based upon microscopic chaos @xcite",
    ". however these resonances have remained mathematical objects .",
    "the present experiments have provided physical reality to them .",
    "it is remarkable that we are able to observe classical resonances in a quantum experiment . because microwaves do not interact ( collide ) with each other , ensemble averaging is easier to achieve in microwaves than in fluids .",
    "thus theories that employ ensemble averaging are ideally applicable to the microwave experiments .",
    "this is true for both open systems as shown here , and for disordered billiards @xcite .",
    "the present work shows that the information concerning the classical resonances is coded into the quantum spectrum .",
    "this is somewhat anticipated in periodic orbit theory , where one can observe the strong similarity between the classical ( eq.([classical - ruelle ] ) and ( [ weight - classical ] ) ) and semiclassical ( eq.([semi - ruelle ] ) and ( [ weight - semi ] ) ) ruelle zeta - functions . a one - to - one correspondence exists between @xmath189 and @xmath190 for the @xmath54-disk system as discussed in sec.i .",

    "one would also expect a relation between the distribution of the classical and semiclassical resonances .",

    "our work demonstrates that suitable quantum correlations diffuse just like classical observables in an open system .",
    "an interesting question is what will happen when the number @xmath0 of disks are very large , a situation that is frequently referred to as the lorentz gas . due to the exponential separation of the nearby orbits ,",
    "a particle is forced to move through the bouncing paths , or undergo diffusive motion , for long time .",
    "one may argue that the particle motion occurs in a system of size @xmath9 * , * in which it has a diffusive path and hence the average escape time @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 , with @xmath198 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "thus the escape rate @xmath199 @xmath200 . a more general expression for diffusion coefficient @xmath198",

    "these are just the rp resonances that we have observed in open systems . using the supersymmetric techniques , agam , altshuler , and andreev @xcite calculated the level correlation and showed that it can be fully determined by the classical spectrum of the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "bogomolny and keating @xcite arrived at a similar conclusion using the periodic orbit approach .",
    "the applicability of these theories for closed systems is currently a matter of debate @xcite , but the applicability of the supersymmetry theory to disordered systems is well established , and is strongly supported by microwave experiments on disordered billiards @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by berry @xcite , the two limits @xmath209 and @xmath210 do not commute with each other , thus the long - time quantum evolution is fundamentally different from long time classical evolution . the probability @xmath211 that the quantum chaotic system decays at time @xmath212 after its formation follows a power law @xcite @xmath213 for @xmath212 larger than the equilibrium time of the system . here",
    "@xmath214 is the average decay width , @xmath215 the number of open channels . as the system is opened up with more channels , the decay will be almost exponential since the above equation can be approximated by @xmath216 , $ ] for large @xmath215 and the weight of the algebraic tail becomes negligible .",
    "more precisely , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a new quantum relaxation time scale @xmath217 , with @xmath218 the heisenberg time . beyond that time",
    ", the quantum correlation decays algebraically . for shorter times",
    ", the quantum correlation decays exponentially in the same way as the classical correlation does . for an open system ,",
    "since the spectrum is continuous , the heisenberg time is actually infinite , and so is the quantum relaxation time @xmath219 .",
    "this is one reason that the classical resonances are clearly visible in the present experiments , and the lorentzian decomposition of the spectral autocorrelation works so well .",
    "the transmission spectrum measured in the microwave experiment directly corresponds to the conductivity measured in electronic quantum dots . in quantum dot experiments though",
    ", the magnetoconductivity @xmath220 is typically measured , so that the resulting autocorrelation @xmath221 is related to the area spectrum , rather than the wave vector dependence @xmath77 measured here which is related to the length spectrum @xcite .",
    "nevertheless similar arguments should be applicable there also , as well as to a variety of other physical systems which are essentially open and chaotic , such as molecular photo - dissociation @xcite and chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "while the coupling to the quantum resonances is well understood , the statistics and also the physical meaning of the experimental coupling @xmath75 to the classical resonances in eq .",
    "( [ auto - cor ] ) deserves further clarification .",
    "it would also be very interesting to examine the role of classical resonances in mixed phase space systems @xcite , such as the open billiards frequently considered in quantum dots where the classical decay is non - exponential @xcite .",
    "more detailed work should be devoted to these and other interesting questions raised by the present results .",
