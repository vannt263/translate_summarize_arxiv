    "the minimal standard model predicts that the electroweak interaction undergoes a first - order phase transition at a finite temperature for light higgs boson masses .",
    "a focus of recent studies has been whether the first - order phase transition survives with sufficient strength for a realistically heavy higgs boson mass @xcite , since the feasibility of electroweak baryogenesis @xcite depends crucially on it .",
    "the first - order nature of the electroweak transition for light higgs bosons can be shown within perturbation theory .",
    "however , perturbation theory breaks down for higgs boson masses larger than about @xmath4 due to bad infrared behavior of the gauge - higgs part of the electroweak theory @xcite .",
    "hence numerical simulation techniques are needed to analyze the nature of the transition for heavy higgs bosons .",
    "extensive studies in this direction have already been performed within the effective 3-dimensional theory approach , in which all non - static modes of the system are integrated out perturbatively .",
    "this approach has the advantage that the full standard model including fermions can be mapped onto a 3-dimensional su(2 ) ( or @xmath5 ) gauge - higgs model , as there are no fermionic static modes at finite temperature . in addition",
    ", thinning out the degree of freedom to those of a 3-dimensional theory significantly reduces the computational requirement .",
    "results from simulations in this approach show that the first - order electroweak transition weakens as the higgs boson mass increases @xcite , and that it turns into a continuous crossover for heavy higgs bosons with a mass @xmath6@xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the endpoint of the first - order transition including its universality class have also been made@xcite .",
    "a potential problem with the 3-dimensional approach is that it relies on perturbation theory to derive the 3-dimensional action so that numerical predictions may involve systematic errors due to truncation of perturbative series . from this point of view",
    "a direct simulation of the 4-dimensional system is preferred .",
    "results from 4-dimensional simulations provide a check on those of the 3-dimensional method .",
    "early studies of the 4-dimensional su(2 ) gauge - higgs system were carried out in refs .",
    "more recently advances have been made with the use of space - time anisotropic lattice @xcite .",
    "this approach alleviates the double - scale problem that there are light modes with long wave length , @xmath7 , near the endpoint where the transition is of second order .    in this article",
    "we report on a study of the endpoint of the su(2 ) gauge - higgs model employing 4-dimensional space - time symmetric lattices with the temporal lattice size @xmath0 , building upon a previous work @xcite .",
    "simulations have been carried out for a wide range of spatial lattice sizes , and finite - size scaling study of lee - yang zeros is used to find the location of the endpoint .",
    "we measure the higgs and w boson masses around the endpoint and estimate the value of the higgs boson mass at the endpoint .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we present the su(2 ) gauge - higgs model lattice action and outline our strategy for finding the endpoint through lee - yang zeros . in section",
    "[ sec : finitet ] , following a brief discussion of susceptibility analysis , lee - yang zeros are examined . another approach to find the endpoint using the binder cumulant",
    "is also described . in section [ sec : zerot ] we present results of the zero - temperature mass measurement . together with our result for the scalar self - coupling constant at the endpoint obtained through lee - yang zero analysis ,",
    "this leads to the value of the higgs boson mass at the endpoint .",
    "[ sec : conc ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "we work with the standard su(2 ) gauge - higgs model action given by @xmath8,\\ ] ] @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the product of link operators around a plaquette , @xmath11 is related to the tree - level gauge coupling as @xmath12 , @xmath13 represents the higgs field hopping parameter and @xmath14 is the scalar self - coupling .",
    "we put the system on a space - time isotropic lattice of a size @xmath15 .    finding the endpoint of the first - order finite - temperature phase transition of the model requires finite - size scaling analyses to quantitatively",
    "distinguish the case of a first - order transition from that of a crossover as the coupling parameters of the model are varied . as the main tool , we employ finite - size scaling analysis of lee - yang zeros @xcite on the complex @xmath13 plane for fixed @xmath11 and @xmath14 @xcite . for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "the infinite volume limit of the zeros pinches the real @xmath13 axis , while they stay away from it if there is no phase transition .",
    "we also supplement this method with analyses of susceptibility and binder cumulant .",
    "our finite - temperature simulations are carried out for the temporal lattice size @xmath0 .",
    "for the spatial lattice size we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the gauge coupling is fixed at @xmath18 . for the scalar",
    "self - coupling we choose five values , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which covers the range of zero - temperature higgs boson mass @xmath21gev @xcite . for each value of @xmath14",
    "the scalar hopping parameter @xmath13 is tuned to the vicinity of the pseudo critical point estimated by the peak position of the susceptibility of the higgs field length squared @xmath22 .",
    "the updating algorithm is a combination of over - relaxation and heatbath methods @xcite , with the ratio of the two for the scalar part and the gauge part as specified in ref .",
    "we make at least @xmath23 iterations of this hybrid over - relaxation algorithm at each coupling parameter point for each lattice size .",
    "the list of coupling values and statistics we use in our finite - temperature simulations are listed in table [ tab : paramt ] .",
    "we also carry out zero - temperature simulations to measure the masses of higgs and w bosons around the endpoint of the first - order phase transition .",
    "for these runs an improved algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite is employed .",
    "details of the runs and results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : zerot ] .",
    "let us first look at the susceptibility of squared higgs length , @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum value of the susceptibility at its peak , calculated by the standard reweighting technique @xcite as a function of @xmath13 , is plotted in figure [ fig : sus ] against the spatial volume normalized by the critical temperature @xmath26 .",
    "errors are estimated by the jackknife procedure with the bin size of @xmath27@xmath28 sweeps , which is listed in table [ tab : paramt ] .    the slope for the smallest scalar coupling @xmath29 approaches unity for large volumes , which is consistent with a first - order transition , while that for the largest coupling @xmath30 tends to a constant , showing an absence of a phase transition .",
    "a continuous decrease of the slope for the intermediate values of @xmath14 indicates that the endpoint of the first - order transition is located in between the two extreme values .",
    "our range of spatial volumes , unfortunately , is not sufficient to pin down the critical value of @xmath14 from the susceptibility data .",
    "the determination of the endpoint of the finite temperature phase transition of the model , thus a characteristic feature of the phase diagram , is made by the use of the lee - yang zeros of the partition function @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "near the first - order phase transition point the partition function reads @xmath32 where the indices s(b ) refer to the symmetric ( higgs ) phase and @xmath33 stands for the free - energy densities .",
    "near the phase transition point we also have @xmath34 since the free - energy density is continuous .",
    "one then obtains @xmath35 \\cosh [ -v \\alpha ( \\kappa -\\kappa_c ) /2 ] \\ , \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows that for complex @xmath13 @xmath31 vanishes at @xmath36 for integer @xmath37 . in case",
    "a first - order phase transition is present , these lee - yang zeros move to the real axis as the volume goes to infinity .",
    "if a phase transition is absent the lee - yang zeros stay away from the real @xmath38 axis .",
    "thus the way the lee - yang zeros move in this limit is a good indicator for the presence or absence of a first - order phase transition .",
    "calculation of the partition function for complex values of @xmath13 is made with the reweighting method @xcite in both imaginary and real directions of @xmath13 . in those cases where we have two ensembles with the same value of @xmath14 and @xmath39 , but different @xmath13",
    ", we combine the two runs by setting the magnitude of the two partition functions to be equal at the midpoint between the two @xmath13 s .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : abs_z_f60d ] we show the absolute value of the partition function normalized by its value at the real axis on the complex @xmath13 plane , @xmath40 for @xmath29 and @xmath41 .",

    "let us call the zero nearest to the real axis as first zero , and denote its location by @xmath43 .",
    "we search for the first zero by the newton - raphson method applied to the equation @xmath44 starting with an initial guess for @xmath43 obtained from the contour plot of @xmath45 .",
    "the error of @xmath43 is estimated by the jackknife method with a bin size given in table [ tab : paramt ] , _",

    "[ fig : fit_ly0 ] values of the imaginary part of the first zero @xmath46 as a function of inverse volume .",
    "finite - size scaling theory predicts that the volume dependence of the imaginary part of the first zero is given by a scaling form , @xmath47 for a first - order phase transition , the infinite volume limit vanishes , @xmath48 , and the exponent takes the value @xmath49 . in the absence of a phase transition , @xmath50 and the value of the exponent is generally unknown .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : res_ly0 ] we plot results for @xmath51 as a function of @xmath14 obtained by fitting the volume dependence of the first zero by the form ( [ eq : fss_ly0 ] ) ( see fig .  [",

    "are taken as fit parameters , and the entire set of volume @xmath53 is employed .",
    "filled symbols mean that they are directly obtained from the simulations carried out at the corresponding values of @xmath14 .",
    "the points plotted with open symbols are obtained from the first zero of the partition function calculated by reweighting the partition function measured at the point where @xmath51 with the filled symbol of the same shape is shown .",
    "the agreement of open symbols of different shapes within errors shows that reweighting from different values of @xmath14 gives consistent results between the measured points .    at small couplings",
    "@xmath54 , @xmath51 is consistent with zero , which agrees with the result of ref .  @xcite",
    "that the transition is of first order in this region . at large couplings @xmath55 ,",
    "@xmath51 no longer vanishes , and hence there is no phase transition .",
    "in order to determine the endpoint of the phase transition , we take the three filled points at @xmath56 and @xmath20 directly obtained from independent simulations without @xmath14-reweighting , and make a fit with a function linear in @xmath14 .",
    "this gives the position of the endpoint to be @xmath57    in figure [ fig : nu_ly0_6 ] we show the exponent of scaling function ( [ eq : fss_ly0 ] ) .",

    "for @xmath58 , where there is no phase transition , the exponent takes a value @xmath59 .",
    "below the endpoint @xmath60 , the exponent shows some trend of increase , but not quite to the value @xmath49 expected for a first - order transition .",
    "we think that this is due to insufficient volume sizes used in our simulation , for which corrections to the leading @xmath61 behavior are not negligible .",
    "to check this point we make an alternative fit of results for the first zero adopting a quadratic ansatz in volume given by @xmath62 and show the results for @xmath51 in figure  [ fig : res_ly0_q_6 ] .",
    "clearly the infinite volume limit @xmath51 starts to deviate from zero around @xmath63 , which is consistent with the estimate of @xmath64 above , albeit located at the lower end of the one standard deviation error band .",
    "we note that the quadratic ansatz ( [ eq : fss_ly0_quad ] ) , formally the first three terms of a laurent series , is expected to be correct in case of a first - order phase transition , for which ( [ eq : zeros ] ) describes the thermodynamic limit . however , it is not a valid assumption in the region of @xmath14 where there is no phase transition .",

    "[ fig : res_ly0 ] , extrapolating the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : res_ly0_q_6 ] from large to small values of @xmath14 to estimate the location of the endpoint @xmath64 is not justified .",

    "we evaluate the minimum of the cumulant as a function of @xmath13 for a given @xmath14 and volume using reweighting .",
    "we then use a scaling ansatz , @xmath66 to extract the infinite - volume value @xmath67 .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : res_ly0 ] .",
    "a change of behavior from non - vanishing values to those consistent with zero at @xmath69 shows that the first - order phase transition terminates around this value .",
    "linearly extrapolating the two independent data at @xmath70 and @xmath71 yields @xmath72 for the endpoint , which is consistent with the result ( [ eq : endpoint ] ) from our study of lee - yang zeros .",

    ". therefore we can not make a statement on the goodness of the fit .",
    "for this reason , we conservatively take the lee - yang value ( [ eq : endpoint ] ) as our best estimate of the endpoint .",
    "to determine the physical parameters characterizing the endpoint , namely the ratio of the higgs boson mass to the w boson mass and the renormalized gauge coupling @xmath73 , we have to perform zero - temperature simulations . as in refs .",

    "we find this to be necessary since the data are strongly correlated for different time distances .",

    "the size of subsamples is typically 500 sweeps .",
    "our results do not show significant volume dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m_11 ] ) , except for the two smallest spatial volumes @xmath90 , @xmath27 for which somewhat different values are obtained compared to those of other volumes .",
    "we then discard those results and take an average over the rest of the volumes .",

    "we obtain @xmath92 making a linear interpolation to the critical value @xmath1 from the lee - yang zero analysis , we find @xmath93 where the error is dominated by that of @xmath64 .    from measurements of wilson loops",
