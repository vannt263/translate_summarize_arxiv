    "are social animals by nature , and the importance of * social interactions * for our physical and mental well - being has been widely acknowledged .",
    "therefore , it is unsurprising that social interactions have been studied extensively by social psychologists in a variety of contexts . fundamental research on social interactions was pioneered by goffman  @xcite , whose _ symbolic interaction perspective _ explains society via the everyday behavior of people and their interactions .",
    "face - to - face conversations are the most common form of social interactions , and * free - standing conversational groups * ( fcgs ) .",

    "studying unstructured social scenes ( , a cocktail party ) is extremely challenging since it involves inferring .",
    "some of the aforementioned problems have been effectively addressed in controlled environments such as round - table meetings ( fig .",
    "[ ill ] ( left ) ) , where behavioral cues concerning orderly arranged participants can be reliably acquired through the use of web - cameras and close - talk microphones .",
    "however , _ all _ of them remain unsolved in unstructured social settings , where only distant surveillance cameras can be used to capture fcgs  @xcite , and microphones may be insufficient to clearly recognize the speaker(s ) at a given time instant due to scene crowding .",
    "we are expressly interested in analyzing fcgs ( fig .",
    "[ ill ] ( right ) ) in this work .    to address the challenges involved in analyzing fcgs , we present * salsa * , a novel  facilitating multimodal and synergetic social scene analysis .",
    "in contrast to social datasets studying round - table meetings  @xcite , or examining fcgs on a small scale  @xcite , salsa contains uninterrupted recordings of an indoor social event involving 18 subjects over 60 minutes , thereby serving as a rich and extensive repository for the behavioral analysis and social signal processing communities .",
    "in addition to the raw multimodal data , salsa also contains position , pose and f - formation annotations over the entire event duration for evaluation purposes , as well as information regarding participants personality traits .    the social event captured in salsa comprised two parts : ( 1 ) a _ poster presentation _ session , and ( 2 ) a _ cocktail party _ scene where participants freely interacted with each other .",
    "there were no constraints imposed in terms of how the subjects were to behave ( , no scripting ) or the spatial layout of the scene during the recordings .",
    "furthermore , the indoor environment where the event was recorded was prone to varying illumination and reverberation conditions . .",
    "finally , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ill ] ( right ) , the crowded nature of the scene and resulting f - formations gave rise to extreme occlusions , which along with the low - resolution of faces captured by surveillance cameras , make visual analysis extremely challenging .",
    "also , crowdedness poses difficulties to audio - based analysis for solving problems such as speaker recognition .",
    "overall , salsa represents the most challenging dataset for studying fcgs to our knowledge .    to alleviate the difficulties in traditional audio - visual analysis due to the challenging nature of the scene , in addition to four wall - mounted cameras acquiring the scene , _ sociometric badges _",
    "@xcite were also worn by participants to record various aspects of their behavior .",
    "these badges include a microphone , an accelerometer , bluetooth and infrared ( ir ) sensors .",
    "the microphone records auditory content that can be used to perform speaker recognition under noisy conditions , while the accelerometer captures person motion .",
    "bluetooth and ir transmitters and receivers provide information regarding interacting persons , and are useful for inferring body pose under occlusions .",
    "cumulatively , these sensors can synergetically enhance estimation of target locations and their head and body orientations , face - to - face interactions , f - formations , and thereby provide a rich description of fcgs behavior . through the salsa dataset , we make two main contributions to aasi research :    * firstly , we believe that the challenging nature of salsa will enable researchers to appreciate the limitations of current aasi approaches , and spur focused and intensive research in this regard .",
    "* we go beyond audio - visual analysis for studying fcgs , and show how multimodal analysis can alleviate difficulties posed by occlusions and crowdedness to more precisely estimate various behavioral cues and personality traits therefrom .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ lr ] reviews prior unimodal and multimodal approaches to aasi , while section  [ rg ] highlights the limitations of traditional aasi approaches and datasets , motivating the need for salsa .",
    "section  [ ds ] describes the salsa dataset , and the synergistic benefit of employing audio , visual and sensor - based cues is demonstrated via experiments in section  [ exp ] .",
    "we finally conclude in section  [ con ] .",
    "this section reviews the state - of - the - art in social behavior analysis with specific emphasis on methods analyzing fcgs",
    ". we will first discuss unimodal approaches ( , vision- , audio- and wearable sensor - based ) and then describe expressly multimodal approaches .",
    "challenges pertaining to surveillance scenes involving fcgs addressed by vision - based methods include detection and tracking of targets in the scene , estimation of social attention direction and detection of f - formations .",
    "we describe works that have examined each of the above problems as follows .    given the cluttered nature of social scenes involving fcgs , detecting and tracking the locations of multiple targets is in itself a highly challenging task .",
    "multi - target tracking from monocular images is achieved through the use of a dynamic bayesian network in  @xcite . as extreme occlusions",
    "are common in social scenes involving fcgs ( see fig .  [ ill ] ) , employing information from multi - camera views can enable robust tracking . the color - based particle filter tracker proposed in  @xcite for multi - target tracking with explicit occlusion handling is notable in this regard . of late , tracking - by - detection  @xcite combined with data association using global appearance and motion optimization  @xcite has benefited multi - target tracking .",
    "some works have further focused on identity - preserving tracking over long sequences  @xcite .",
    "these methods assume a sufficiently large number of high - confidence detections which might not always be available with fcgs due to persistent long - term occlusions , although recent works have focused on the detection problem under partial occlusion @xcite .",
    "multi - target tracking is further shown to improve by incorporating aspects of human social behavior  @xcite , as well as with activity analysis  @xcite .",
    "however , f - formations are special groups , characterized by static arrangements of interacting persons constrained by their locations and head / body orientations .",
    "social attention determination in round - table meetings , where high - resolution face images are available , has been studied extensively .",
    "vision - based approaches typically employ head pose as a proxy to determine social attention direction  @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "head pose estimation ( hpe ) from blurry surveillance videos is much more difficult .",
    "visual attention direction of moving targets is estimated by smith  @xcite using position and head pose cues , but social scenes or occlusions are not addressed here .",
    "some works have exploited the relationship between walking direction and head / body pose to achieve hpe from surveillance videos under limiting conditions where no labeled training examples are available , or under occlusions  @xcite .",
    "focus - of - attention estimation in social scenes is explicitly addressed by bazzani  @xcite , who model a person s visual field in a 3d scene using a subjective view frustum .    .",
    "also , the interest on detecting social interactions and f - formations from video has intensively grown .",
    "cristani  @xcite employ positional and head orientation estimates to detect f - formations based on a hough voting strategy .",
    "bazzani  @xcite gather information concerning f - formations in a social scene using the inter - relation pattern matrix .",
    "f - formations are modeled as maximal cliques in edge - weighted graphs , and each target is presumed to be oriented towards the closest neighbor but head / body orientation is not explicitly computed .",
    "gan  @xcite detect f - formations upon inferring location and orientation of subjects using depth sensors and cameras .",
    "setti  @xcite propose a graph - cuts based framework for f - formation detection based on the position and head orientation estimates of targets . based on experiments performed on four datasets ( _ idiap poster _",
    "@xcite , _ cocktail party _",
    "@xcite , _ coffee break _",
    "@xcite and _ gdet _",
    "@xcite ) , their method outperforms six state - of - the - art methods in the literature .      studying interactional behavior in unstructured social settings solely using audio or speech - based cues is extremely challenging , as fcgs are not only characterized by speaking activity , but also by non - verbal cues such as head and body pose , gestural and proxemic cues .",
    "furthermore , classical problems in audio analysis become extremely challenging and remain unexplored in crowded indoor environments involving a large number of targets . indeed , current methodologies for speaker diarization @xcite , sound source separation @xcite or localization @xcite address scenarios with few persons .",
    "nevertheless , a few studies on audio - based detection of fcgs have been published .",
    "wyatt  @xcite tackle the problem of detecting fcgs upon recognizing the speaker using temporal and spectral audio features .",
    "targets are then clustered to determine co - located groups on the basis of speaker labels .",
    "more recently , fcg detection and network inference is achieved in  @xcite employing a conversation sensing system to perform speaker recognition , and f - formations are detected based on proximity information obtained using bluetooth sensors .",
    "wearable sensors can provide complementary behavioral cues in situations where visual and speech data are unreliable due to occlusions and crowdedness . hung  @xcite detect fcgs in social gatherings by measuring motion via an accelerometer . with the increased usage of smartphones ,",
    "mobile sensor data have also become a viable choice for analysis of social interactions or more complex social systems  @xcite . via mobile phones",
    ", proximity can be inferred from wifi and bluetooth  @xcite .",
    "however , the spatial resolution of these sensors is limited to only a few meters , and the co - location of mobile devices does not necessarily indicate a social interaction between the corresponding individuals .",
    "therefore , cattuto  @xcite propose a framework that balances scalability and resolution through a sensing tier consisting of cheap and unobtrusive active rfid devices , which are capable of sensing face - to - face interactions as well as spatial proximity over different scale lengths down to one meter or less .",
    "nevertheless , we note that many of these works address relatively less crowded scenarios , not comparable in complexity to salsa .",
    "multimodal approaches to social interaction have essentially examined small - group interactions such as round - table meetings , and mainly involve audio - visual analysis as detailed below .",
    "examples of databases containing audio - visual recordings and associated annotations are the canal9  @xcite , ami  @xcite , mission survival  @xcite , free talk @xcite and the idiap wolf  @xcite corpora . .",
    "all these data collection efforts have inspired inter - disciplinary research in the field of human behavior understanding and led to the emergence of the social signal processing community  @xcite .",
    "several of these databases have been utilized for isolating traits relating to an individual ( , big - five personality traits  @xcite ) or a group ( such as _ dominance _  @xcite ) .",
    "choudhury and pentland  @xcite initiated behavior analysis using wearable sensors by developing the _ sociometer_. recently , olgun  @xcite proposed the _",
    "sociometric badge _ , which stores ( i ) motion using an accelerometer , ( ii ) speech features ( rather than raw audio ) , ( iii ) position information and ( iv ) proximity to other individuals using a bluetooth sensor , and ( v ) face - to - face interactions via an infrared sensor .",
    "sociometric badges have been used to capture face - to - face communication patterns , examine relationships among individuals and model collective and organizational behavior  @xcite , detect personality traits and states  @xcite , and predict outcomes such as productivity and job satisfaction  @xcite .",
    "another notable aasi work employing multi - sensory information is that of matic  @xcite , who estimate body orientation and inter - personal distance via mobile data and speech activity to detect social interactions .",
    "while human behavior has been studied extensively in controlled settings such as round - table meetings , achieving the same with fcgs is way more difficult as close audio - visual examination of targets is precluded by the crowded and occluded nature of the scene .",
    "we carried out an extensive analysis of previous aasi data sets focusing on fcgs ; they have mainly been used to address two research problems : ( 1 ) detecting f - formations and ( 2 ) studying individual and group behavior from multiple sensing modalities .",
    "the vast majority of works addressing f - formation detection are vision - based .",
    "[ fig : ffpic ] presents snapshots of datasets used for f - formation detection , and positions them with respect to the number ( denoted using # ) of annotated frames and scene targets . among them",
    ", salsa is unique due to its ( i ) multimodal nature , ( ii ) extensive annotations available over a long duration and ( iii ) challenging nature of the captured scene .",
    "figure  [ fig : mmpic ] depicts the datasets used for individual and group behavioral analysis . while the first group ( light - gray ) consists of audio - visual recordings spanning over hours acquired under controlled settings , the second group ( dark - gray ) comprises datasets acquired over days / months for studying social networks and group relationships .",
    "salsa again stands out as it records information from both static cameras and wearable sensors , leading to a previously non - existent and highly informative combination of sensing modalities .",
    "this section details some of the limitations of current aasi approaches regarding f - formation detection and individual and group behavior analysis , thereby throwing light on how salsa can spur critical research in these respects .",
    "human tracking and pose estimation in a social context is challenging for several reasons .",
    "firstly , a person s visual appearance can change considerably across the scene due to camera perspective and uneven illumination , as well as with pose and posture . secondly",
    ", large and persistent occlusions are frequent in such scenes , which corrupt subsequent observations .",
    "thirdly , integrating auditory information to aid localization and orientation estimation is also difficult due to its intermittent nature and the adverse impact of reverberations and interfering sources . beyond inherent complexity , the state - of - the - art",
    "is further challenged when raw audio - visual data can not be recorded for processing or scene - specific optimization , , due to privacy concerns .",
    "accurate fcg behavior analysis requires the correct assignment of observations to sources ( targets ) over the long run .",
    "identity switches during tracking can corrupt the extraction of aggregated features that develop over time to infer personality traits , functional roles , or interaction networks , and long - term identity - preserving multi - target tracking is still unachievable .",
    "furthermore , existing appearance - based pose estimation methods are not adapted to highly cluttered scenes with large and persistent occlusions .",
    "finally , from the computational perspective , multi - target approaches are not able to robustly and efficiently scale to large groups .",
    "while numerous research studies have attempted speech , speaker and prosodics recognition under controlled conditions , several issues arise when auditory information is captured via mobile microphones in crowded indoor scenes .",
    "firstly , regular indoor environments are prone to reverberations , which adversely affect many sound processing techniques .",
    "secondly , intermittence of the speech signal necessitates speaker diarization prior to processing .",
    "thirdly , the speech signal is also spatially sparse , and source separation techniques are usually required to segment speaker activity .",
    "currently , there are no algorithms addressing source separation or diarization in the presence of a large number of sound sources and uncontrolled conditions .",
    "while multimodal approaches have addressed these problems via audio - visual processing , they still can not work with large groups of people and crowded indoor environments involving unconstrained and evolving interactions .",
    "detecting f - formations in unconstrained environments is a complex task .",
    "as f - formations are characterized by mutually located and oriented persons , robust tracking and pose estimation algorithms are necessary .",
    "however , both multi - target tracking and head / body pose estimation in crowded scenes are difficult as discussed earlier . even under ideal conditions ,",
    "f - formation shapes are influenced by ( i ) the environment s layout , , room shape , furniture and other physical obstacles , ( ii ) scene crowdedness and ( iii ) attention hotspots such a poster , painting ,  while existing methodologies typically assume that f - formation members are placed on an ellipse , robust f - formation detection requires accounting for the above factors as well .",
    "also , most algorithms are visually driven , and few multimodal approaches exist to this end .",
    "works seeking to recognize personality traits from interactive behavior have traditionally relied on the visual and auditory modalities . target position and pose , prosodic and intonation inference , face - to - face interaction detection , bodily gestures and facial expressions",
    "are commonly used for assessing the big - five personality traits .",
    "most prior works study these behaviors in the context of round - table meetings , where participants are regularly arranged in space , and therefore their positions and body orientations are known _",
    "a priori_. under these conditions , behavior analysis algorithms deliver precise estimates concerning interactional behavior , thereby facilitating personality trait recognition .",
    "nevertheless , there are very few works that studied personality inference from unstructured interactions involving fcgs .",
    "assessing the personality traits of a large number of interacting persons in crowded scenarios , where the group structure evolves progressively , is a highly challenging task .",
    "in such cases , people constantly leave and join groups , and therefore groups are created , split , and merged .",
    "an in - depth analysis should take the group dynamics into account in addition to the evolving physical arrangements and occasional conversations .",
    "given that personality inference is a sophisticated and subtle task , the right combination of cues extracted from different modalities can lead to a robust assessment .      upon analyzing the state - of - the - art in behavior analysis and personality inference , we conclude that : ( i ) even if multimodal analysis has been found to outperform unimodal approaches and provide a richer representation of social interplays , some key tasks are not yet addressed in a multimodal fashion , pose estimation and f - formation detection ; ( ii ) social interactions have been studied under controlled settings , and there is a paucity of methods able to cope with unconstrained environments involving large groups , crowded spaces and highly dynamic interactions , and ( iii ) most existing approaches have independently studied the different behavioral tasks  while it is known that bidirectional links between the tasks exist , these links have been rarely exploited . .",
    ", we recorded salsa , whose description is presented in the next section .",
    "in order to provide a new and challenging evaluation framework for novel methodologies addressing the aforementioned challenges , we introduce the salsa ( synergetic social scene analysis ) dataset .",
    "salsa represents an excellent test - bed for multimodal human behavior understanding due to the following reasons .",
    "firstly , all behavioral data were collected in a regular indoor space with the participants only requiring to wear portable and compact sociometric badges which ensured naturalistic social behavior .",
    "secondly , due to the unconstrained nature of the scene , the recordings contain numerous artifacts such as varying illumination , visual occlusions , reverberations or interfering sound sources .",
    "thirdly , the recorded event involved 18 persons : such large social groups have rarely been studied in the behavior analysis literature .",
    "these participants did not receive any special instructions or scripts prior to the recording , and the resulting social interactions were therefore free - willed and hedonistic in nature . finally , the social interplay was recorded via four wall - mounted surveillance cameras and the _ _ sociometric badges _ _ worn by the targets .",
    "these badges recorded different aspects of the targets social behavior such as audio or motion as detailed later .",
    "this combination of static cameras and wearable sensors is scarce in the literature , and provides a wealth of behavioral information as shown in section  [ exp ] .",
    "these four salient characteristics place salsa in a unique position among the various datasets available for studying social behavior , see figures  [ fig : ffpic ] and  [ fig : mmpic ] .",
    "salsa was recorded in a regular indoor space and the captured social event involved 18 participants and consisted of two parts of roughly equal duration .",
    "the first part consisted of a _",
    "poster presentation _ session , where four research studies were presented by graduate students . a fifth person chaired the poster session . in the second half",
    ", all participants were allowed to freely interact over food and beverages during a _",
    "cocktail party_.    it needs to be noted here that while some participants had specific roles to play during the poster presentation session , none were given any instructions on how to act in the form of a script .",
    "consequently , the interaction dynamics correspond to those of a natural social interplay .",
    "obviously , participants with different roles ( chair , poster presenter , attendee ) are expected to have different interaction dynamics , and these roles were designed to help behavioral researchers working on role recognition .",
    ".[tab : sensors]description of the sensors used in salsa .",
    "stft denotes short - time fourier transform .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     we conducted a preliminary statistical analysis ( summarized in table  [ tab : personality ] ) on the features derived from the interaction graphs described above , and investigated their associations with the personality data provided by salsa .",
    "we only report associations that are significant at @xmath1 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "unfortunately , we did not find statistical significant correlations between the personality traits and the auditory features .",
    "this issue will be subject of further investigation .",
    "extraversion , a personality trait lying in the tendency to behave in a way to engage and attract other people , and hence usually activated in situations such as social gatherings , was found to be significantly associated ( @xmath2 ) with the standard deviation of the degree centrality computed on the 60 sec dynamic infra - red network . in other words , more extraverted targets appear to establish face - to - face interactions of variable duration , and thus engage with groups of diverse cardinality within the 1-minute windows under analysis .",
    "the expansion of the time window to 120 seconds provided additional insights : the higher a target scored on the extraversion trait , the higher the median of his / her _ betweenness _ centrality ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this suggests that the extravert targets in salsa tended to act as _ brokers _ , , they served as connectors between clusters of people who had fewer face - to - face interactions .",
    "also , more agreeable subjects in salsa were found to have a tendency towards engaging in face - to - face interactions with a higher number of people within highly connected clusters .",
    "agreeableness was found to be significantly associated with the median degree centrality ( @xmath4 ) and the median nodal efficiency ( @xmath5 ) as computed on the 120 sec graphs .",
    "emotional stability was found to be negatively associated with median transitivity ( @xmath6 ) on the 60 sec infra - red graphs this indicated that neurotic persons in salsa tended to engage face - to - face during unbalanced interaction events .",
    "regarding conscientiousness , several significant associations were found .",
    "in particular , from the 60 sec dynamic interaction networks built on infra - red data , we noted that conscientious subjects tended to participate in densely connected groups , as indicated by the positive association with mean transitivity ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "thus , within the groups that naturally formed in the salsa context , conscientious subjects took part mainly in those groups where the participants engaged more with each other .",
    "this fact is further confirmed by the significant association found on the static graph built on infra - red data between this trait and local efficiency ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "interestingly , the median nodal efficiency extracted from the dynamic graphs built upon group annotations consistently shows similar associations with this trait ( @xmath8 using a 120sec window , @xmath5 using 60 sec ) .",
    "the social psychology literature does not offer many quantitative studies regarding the creativity ( or openness to experience ) trait . given this lack of information ,",
    "the associations detected were remarkable , and deserve deeper investigation .",
    "this trait seemed to be associated with : i ) local efficiency ( @xmath9 ) computed on the static face - to - face interaction network ; ii ) mean closeness centrality ( @xmath10 ) computed on the 60 sec graphs built on infra - red ; iii ) betweenness centrality ( @xmath5 ) , nodal efficiency ( @xmath11 ) , and transitivity ( @xmath12 ) computed on the static group interaction network ; and iv ) mean degree in both 60 sec ( @xmath13 ) and 120 sec ( @xmath14 ) graphs built from group annotations .",
    "hence , creative persons seemed to participate overall in smaller and less connected networks than conservative targets .    while the above analyses present correlations between some of the behavioral cues that can be extracted from the salsa data and high - level personality traits , we believe the entire gamut of information available can enable the study of both individual and group - level traits ( , _ dominance _ ) . also , unlike round - table meetings , which typically have an agenda based on which participants assume certain roles that may not relate to their actual personality",
    ", salsa captures hedonistic and free - wheeling social interactions , which even if challenging to analyze , can provide a wealth of information about one s native behavior and personality .",
    "via extensive experiments , we have demonstrated how salsa represents a rich but challenging dataset for analysis of fcgs .",
    "vision - based analysis for target tracking , head and body pose estimation and f - formation detection evidenced the shortcomings of state - of - the - art methodologies when posed with cluttered scenes with persisting and extreme occlusions .",
    "however , additional sensors available as part of the sociometric badge were found to be helpful in cases where visual analysis was difficult in particular , ( i ) the infra - red sensor which indicates both the proximity and body pose of the interacting counterpart was found to improve f - formation detection , ( ii ) both ir and visual cues were found to have significant correlations with the big - five personality traits , and ( iii ) improved speaker recognition with multi - badge speech data indicates the promise of additionally utilizing visual and accelerometer data to this end .",
    "future research directions include : ( a ) developing new methodologies for robust audio processing in cluttered environments with many dynamic targets , ( b ) utilizing the bluetooth and accelerometer data for f - formation detection and personality trait recognition , and ( c ) designing tracking and head / body pose estimation algorithms capable of exploiting multimodal data . given the extensive raw data and accompanying annotations available for analysis and benchmarking , we believe salsa can spur systematic and intensive research to address the highlighted problems in a multimodal fashion in the near future . evidently , salsa would serve as a precious resource for the computer vision , audio processing , social robotics , social signal processing and affective computing communities among others .",
