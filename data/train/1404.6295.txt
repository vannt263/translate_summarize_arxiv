    "europium compounds are known to show a variety of magnetic and thermal properties due to existence of different valence states  @xcite . in the divalent compounds ,",
    "eu ions have 4@xmath3 configuration ( eu@xmath5 ) with atomic spin @xmath6 , angular momentum @xmath7 , and total angular momentum @xmath8 showing a large magnetic moment , while in the trivalent compounds , eu ions have 4@xmath9 configuration ( eu@xmath10 ) with @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , thus no magnetic moment . some of these compounds such as eupd@xmath0si@xmath0  @xcite , euni@xmath0(si@xmath13ge@xmath14)@xmath0  @xcite , and eurh@xmath0si@xmath0  @xcite show the valence instability with increasing temperature , pressure , and magnetic field . in particular , euni@xmath0p@xmath0 has recently received much attention because it shows both heavy - fermion and mixed - valence behaviors .",
    "in fact , mssbauer isomer - shift experiment reports a mixed valence state even at zero temperature  @xcite and the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath4 shows a large value of 100 mj/(k@xmath15mol )  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , hiranaka _ et .",
    "@xcite grew the single crystalline euni@xmath0p@xmath0 and carried out systematic measurements of resistivity , specific heat , susceptibility , and thermal expansion .",
    "the low - temperature data of resistivity and specific heat show the heavy - fermion behavior with a large electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath16 mj/(k@xmath15 mol ) .",
    "the susceptibility data show the curie - weiss behavior with the effective bohr magneton number @xmath17 @xmath18eu and the weiss constant @xmath19 k in the high temperature regime , and becomes almost constant ( @xmath20 emu / mol ) below 50 k. anomalous 4@xmath1 electronic contribution to the volume expansion @xmath21 is found to increase rapidly up to 100 k and tends to saturate with increasing temperature .",
    "the new aspect which they found is that the temperature variation of @xmath21 scales well to that of the average eu valence .",
    "because the present system shows both the heavy - fermion and mixed - valence behaviors and the anomalous volume expansion continues up to 200 k , which is far above the experimentally suggested kondo temperature @xmath22 ( @xmath23 k ) , the scaling relation may be controlled by an extra - parameter other than @xmath22 , _",
    "i.e. _ , a valence fluctuation temperature @xmath24 .    in this paper , we point out that the temperature dependence of volume thermal expansion and its scaling relation to the average 4@xmath1 electron number found in experiment are basically explained by a simple and phenomenological 2@xmath4-state model .",
    "the model was first proposed by weiss  @xcite to explain the anomalous thermal expansion of @xmath4fe and the fe - ni invar alloys  @xcite .",
    "it assumes the existence of two magnetic states , a low - spin small - volume state and a high - spin large - volume state .",
    "the former is assumed to be the ground state in @xmath4fe , while the latter is assumed to be stabilized at the ground state in the invar alloys  @xcite .",
    "one can describe the excitations from the ground state to the independent excitations on sites with use of the weiss model even in the itinerant electron system .",
    "we remark that apart from the anomalous volume expansion , the weiss model is somewhat similar to the interconfiguration fluctuation ( icf ) model for some rare - earth compounds  @xcite .",
    "the present model however differes from the icf model in the following points .",
    "( 1 ) the weiss model assumes the nondegenerate metallic ground state ( _ i.e. _ , a heavy - fermion state in the present case ) , while the icf model assume the 4f atomic state with an integral 4f electron number as the ground state .",
    "( 2 ) the weiss model does not make use of any other assumptions , while the icf model introduces phenomenologically a fluctuation temperature ( @xmath25 ) corresponding to the width of the 4f level state .    in the following section ,",
    "we apply the concept of the 2@xmath4-state model in order to explain a strong temperature dependence which is seen in the experimental data of euni@xmath0p@xmath0 . with use of the 2-state weiss model",
    ", we will demonstrate that the model explains an overall temperature dependence of thermal expansion , its scaling relation to the 4@xmath1 electron number , the specific heat , and the susceptibility .",
    "we summalize the conclusion in the last section 3 .",
    "experimentally , a heavy - fermion state is realized in euni@xmath0p@xmath0 at low temperatures .",
    "we therefore assume that the ground state is a nonmagnetic heavy - fermion state with a small volume per atom @xmath26 as found experimentally , and call this state ` the low spin state ' hereafter .",
    "we neglect the low energy excitations associated with the heavy - fermions which yields the @xmath27-linear specific heat .",
    "instead , we take into account independent excitations to the atomic eu@xmath5 state with @xmath28 and a large volume @xmath29 .",
    "we call the single - site excited state on each site ` the high spin state ' .",
    "the volume per eu atom is then characterized by @xmath30 as @xmath31 , and the thermal average @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the inverse temperature and @xmath35 denotes the energy of the system with the state @xmath30 .",
    "note that we allocated ` @xmath12 ' to ` the low - spin state ' for convenience .",
    "it does not means that the ground state is eu@xmath36 .",

    "with use of a characteristic temperature @xmath54 k , we find that the formula ( [ vol2 ] ) explains the overall feature of the experimental thermal expansion .",
    "the deviation from the data at low temperatures is attributed to the fact that the model does not take into account the low - energy excitations associated with the heavy - fermion states .    , which is calculated from eq .",

    "we obtain in the same way the average 4@xmath1 electron number as @xmath59 here @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) being the electron number in the low - spin ( high - spin ) state .",
    "note that @xmath61 is the average @xmath1 electron number per eu atom in the heavy - fermion ground state ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath63 ) . equation ( [ n4f ] ) implies that there is a scaling relation between the volume change @xmath52 and that of 4@xmath1 electron number @xmath64 : @xmath65 the relation is in agreement with the experimental fact  @xcite .",

    "in fact , the internal energy @xmath71 in the weiss model is given by @xmath72 thus we have a relation , @xmath73 and find a scaling relation , @xmath74 here @xmath70 is the electronic contribution in the present model , being given by @xmath75 it should be noted however that the relation ( [ alphav ] ) does not necessarily mean that the schottky - like anomaly is visible in the experimental data of specific heat @xmath76 , though the data of the volume expansion coefficient show a clear anomaly around 40 k  @xcite . in order to see this point , we consider here a simple debye model as a lattice contribution @xmath77 to the specific heat : @xmath78 . here",

    "the total specific heat is given by @xmath81 .",
    "figure 2 shows the calculated specific heat vs experimental data .",
    "the present theory is consistent with the experimental data of the specific heat , and we find that the anomalous contribution can not be seen in the total @xmath76 because of a large lattice contribution of @xmath77 and its steep slope in the temperature region between 40 k and 80 k  @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility in the 2-state weiss model is obtained by adding the zeeman term to the hamiltonian .",

    "@xmath84 here the ` @xmath12 ' state is the heavy - fermion ground state under the magnetic field @xmath83 . with use of the energy @xmath38 and the heavy - fermion ground - state susceptibility @xmath85 which might be inversely proportional to the kondo temperature",
    ", the energy under the magnetic field should be given by @xmath86 the magnetization per atom in the low spin state is therefore given by @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , the energy in the high spin state ( @xmath88 ) is given by @xmath89 here @xmath90 is land s @xmath91 factor , @xmath92 is a phenomenological van vleck constant  @xcite .",

    "@xmath99 is the effective bohr magneton number in the high - spin state , _",

    "( [ chimod ] ) ) . ]    the susceptibility ( [ chi0 ] ) however does not explain an overall temperature variation of the experimental data .",
    "we have to take into account the effect of polarization due to the rkky - like magnetic interaction via conduction electrons .",
    "this produces an effective magnetic field according to the mean - field picture and should produce the weiss constant @xmath111 in the susceptibility when @xmath88 .",
    "we reach then the following susceptibility . @xmath112 here @xmath113 is the curie constant in the high - spin state .",
    "it should be noted that the polarization effects due to the magnetic field are negligible for the other quantities because they are of order of @xmath114 .",
    "using the experimental values @xmath19 k and @xmath109 emu / mol  @xcite and choosing @xmath115 as @xmath110 emu / mol , we can explain the global feature of temperature dependence of euni@xmath0p@xmath0 as shown in fig .",
    "3 . note that we did not take into account the anisotropy due to tetragonal structure in the present analysis for simplicity .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the phenomenological 2-state weiss model with an emphasis of local excitations explains an overall feature of the volume expansion due to 4@xmath1 electrons as well as the scaling relation between the 4@xmath1 electron contribution to the volume expansion and the average 4@xmath1 electron number .",
    "these results indicate that the strong temperature dependence of thermal expansion found in this system is mainly determined by local excitations associated with valence fluctuations .",
    "we also predicted that there is another scaling relation between the thermal expansion coefficient due to the 4@xmath1 electrons and the associated specific heat .",
    "we have also shown that calculated effective bohr magneton number in the high - temperature limit is in good agreement with the experimental value 7.4 @xmath18eu .",
    "for explanation of temperature dependence of susceptibility , we need inter - site magnetic interactions via conduction electrons .",
    "modified susceptibility explains the temperature dependence of the experimental data , and indicates that there are three temperature scales , the characteristic temperature @xmath116 for on - site valence fluctuations , the weiss constant @xmath117 associated with the rkky type interactions via conduction electrons , and the kondo temperature @xmath22 for the formation of heavy - fermions .",
    "the results presented in this paper indicate that the heavy - fermion ground state is collapsed by valence fluctuations which are characterized by @xmath24 . in this sense , the characteristic temperature @xmath24 plays an essential role in the physics of euni@xmath0p@xmath0 . it has not yet been clarified theoretically whether or not the kondo temperature is well - defined in this system .",
    "although the present model is consistent with the heavy - fermion ground state as well as the effective bohr magneton number in the high temperature limit which is directly related to the local excitations of @xmath118 , it does not take into account the low energy excitations .",
    "the temperature dependence associated with the heavy - fermions is not described here .",
    "the deviation of @xmath42 from the experimental data below 40 k in fig . 1 should be attributed to this fact . too small a specific heat below 30 k found in fig .",
    "2 is due to the neglect of the low energy excitations .",
