    "phantom energy remains for the moment a theoretical possibility [ 1 ] with potential application to describe super - accelerated evolution in both the primordial and late universe .",
    "but it is not just that .",
    "concerning late evolution of the universe , the possibility that the equation of state governing current cosmic evolution would correspond to phantom energy is still not at all excluded [ 2 ] .",
    "actually , if the accelerating expansion of the universe turned out to be not due to the existence of a positive cosmological constant , then presently supplied cosmic data appear to favor phantom energy over quintessence models for positive internal energy fields [ 3 ] . from a theoretical point of view , the study of phantom energy is by itself a very interesting subject .",
    "it actually bears some resemblance with the study of black holes in the early seventies by its intrinsic interest and in what then black holes were considered to be on the borderline of being or not actual objects .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that phantom energy had recently received a great deal of attention [ 4 ] .",
    "phantom energy can be defined in all present models for dark energy by simply introducing in such models a spontaneous violation of the dominant energy condition ; that is , if e.g. we consider an equation of state @xmath0 , then the phantom appears when we enforce @xmath2 , which in turn implies that the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in order to check the occurrence of phantom energy in the universe , it suffices to determine what the equation of state of the universe is .",
    "actually cosmic phantom energy keeps a fairly large set of rather weird properties , including [ 4 ] the above - mentioned violation of the dominant energy condition , @xmath3 , naive superluminal sound speed , increasing energy density with cosmic time , and ultimately the emergence in a finite time in the future of what has been dubbed big rip [ 5 ] , which is a true curvature singularity where all existing particles are coherently ripped apart .",
    "the latter prediction actually was already advanced in 1986 by barrow , galloway and tipler [ 5 ] . in this paper",
    "we shall add some extra weirdness concerning the thermodynamic properties of phantom energy ; more precisely , we show that phantom energy is characterized by a negative temperature and that this implies the phantom to be quantized , even though it is the largest possible system .",
    "this overall quantum nature of the cosmic phantom fluid comes about as a consequence from preserving the weak energy condition , and can be shown by either taking the phantom stuff to be made up of super - light axions [ 7 ] , or defining the phantom spacetime to be euclidean .",
    "thus , the aim of the present paper is at studying the thermodynamic properties of cosmic phantom energy . the influence that the presence of black holes may have on the phantom field",
    "is also explored .",
    "the main results are : ( i ) we confirm and interpret the result obtained by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko [ 8 ] that all black holes in the universe loss their mass to vanish at the big rip ; ( ii ) since the internal phantom energy is negative , whereas the phantom temperature is definite negative , and hence hotter than any other sources in the universe [ 9 ] , its entropy is always positive , even though holding of the second law is not guaranteed by quantum - mechanical reasons ; ( iii ) relative to the observable matter in the universe , the cosmic phantom field can be regarded as a cosmological source of information and negative entropy ; and ( iv ) in the presence of phantom radiation , quantum level systems undergo novel radiative processes that include a stimulated absorption phenomenon by which phantom radiation is attenuated .",
    "the paper can be outlined as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider and extend the process of phantom energy accretion by black holes first studied by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko [ 8 ] , interpreting it in terms of a new thermodynamic description of a phantom fluid which is developed and includes a negative temperature and a positive entropy .",
    "a discussion of the properties and meaning of the cosmological information induced by the presence of dominating phantom energy in the universe , as well as the implications that it may have on the emergence of life and the anthropic principle , is included in sec .",
    "iii . by interpreting the phantom field as a radiation field",
    ", we consider some of the quantum statistical - thermodynamic properties of the resulting description , including a generalized wien spectrum ( sec .",
    "iv ) and a derivation of the generalized planck law based on introducing novel radiative processes ( sec .",
    "v ) . we finally conclude and add some more comments in sec .",
    "phantom energy has been criticized by several authors [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "the main difficulty stemming from such criticisms concerns the issue of phantom stability and this could still be circumvented if an axion model is considered for the phantom field [ 7 ] .",
    "indeed , the large amount of papers on the phantom subject that have appeared [ 4 - 6 ] before and after references [ 10 - 12 ] reflects the fact that most of the criticisms can actually be regarded as manifesting weird phantom properties that could nevertheless be accommodated into the current and future evolution of the universe without contradicting observations .      among such properties ,",
    "an intriguing recent result is the discovery by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko [ 8 ] that all black holes in a universe filled with a fluid violating the dominant energy condition ( i.e. a phantom - energy fluid inducing a big rip singularity in the future ) ) will steadily loss all of their mass to fully disappear , all at once , at the big rip , no matter their initial mass or the moment at which they were formed .",
    "in fact , by extending the classical theory of michel [ 13 ] , these authors found that , as a result of dark energy accretion , the mass @xmath4 of a black hole in a universe filled with a general quintessence scalar field describable by means of a fluid with equation of state @xmath0 , varies at a rate given by [ 8 ] @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a dimensionless positive constant and @xmath7 . using then the constant equation of state @xmath0 for the fluid described by the quintessence field , eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) can finally be re - written as @xmath8 thus , since in all conceivable situations @xmath9 should be satisfied , accretion of dark energy onto a black hole leads the mass of this black hole to increase if @xmath10 and , as a consequence from the negative value of the internal energy of the phantom field , to a mass loss in the case that @xmath1 .",
    "the stability of the schwarzschild - de sitter universe [ 14 ] to the dark - energy accretion process is ensured by the fact that a positive cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath11 for which the rate @xmath12 . of course",
    ", in this case there will still be a continuous loss of black hole mass due to hawking radiation , a process which is not included in the present formalism .    for the flat geometry which our universe appears to satisfy ,",
    "it has been obtained [ 15 ] that the most general expression of the scale factor of a universe filled with such a general quintessence field is given by @xmath13},\\ ] ] in which @xmath14 is taken as the initial value of the scale factor at the onset of the accelerating regime .",
    "this solution satisfies the friedmann equation for flat geometry and the conservation law for cosmic energy . if we , moreover , re - interpret the constant @xmath15 as the value of the scale factor at the onset of the radiation domination era for @xmath16 , then re - scaling time @xmath17 so that @xmath18 , we in fact obtain from eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) the expression of the scale factor for a decelerating radiation - dominated universe , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "( 2.3 ) furthermore tells us that for the interval @xmath20 the scale factor steadily increases in an accelerating fashion , with @xmath17 tending to infinity as @xmath21 . from the very onset of the phantom energy regime @xmath1 [ 3 ] assumed to occur at @xmath22 , the scale factor ( 2.3 ) predicts a super - accelerated expansion along that regime which finally reaches the so - called big rip curvature singularity as @xmath17 approaches the finite time value @xmath23 after the big rip , as @xmath24 , the universe would start a period of continuous contraction where its size tended to vanish as @xmath21 . the super - accelerated expanding phase and",
    "the contracting phase would however be disconnected to each other because the big rip is a true curvature singularity .    if , as it is assumed throughout this paper , we set @xmath25 constant , the integration of the cosmic conservation law for energy , @xmath26 [ 16 ] , in this case leads to an expression for the dark energy density @xmath27 with @xmath28 a constant .",
    "thus , the energy density consistently becomes constant for the cosmological constant case @xmath11 , it steadily decreases with the scale factor for @xmath29 , and rather surprisingly increases with @xmath30 for @xmath1 .",
    "once the scale factor @xmath31 and the energy density @xmath32 have been obtained , the field theory associated with the dark energy fluid through the definitions of the pressure and energy density , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , can be solved ( i.e. expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be obtained ) .",
    "we in this way get @xmath37 @xmath38 the phantom regime is derived when we let @xmath39 and @xmath1 [ 7 ] .",
    "it can be seen that both @xmath40 and @xmath41 diverge at the big rip .",
    "inserting now eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) and ( 2.5 ) into eq . ( 2.2 ) and integrating we finally obtain the black hole mass time - evolution equation [ 17 ] @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the initial mass of the black hole , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "( 2.6 ) actually shows the same predictions as those which were first deduced in ref .",
    "that is : ( i ) for @xmath10 , @xmath4 monotonically increases with time @xmath17 , tending to a maximum value @xmath46 as @xmath21 .",
    "this result comes about because quintessence fields with @xmath10 have positive energy which , when accreted onto the black hole , makes the positive mass of this black hole to increase .",
    "( ii ) if @xmath11 , the black hole mass remains constant , i.e. the black hole does not accrete any energy from vacuum simply because there then is anything like a quintessence vacuum field , but a cosmological constant instead .",
    "( iii ) finally , and more importantly , such as it was pointed out by babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko [ 8 ] , if @xmath1 , then @xmath4 steadily decreases with time @xmath17 and tends to vanish as @xmath17 approaches the big rip singularity at time @xmath47 . in order for accounting for such a highly unconventional behaviour",
    "one must resort to the feature that the internal phantom energy is negative definite and therefore , when it is accreted onto black holes , it subtracts rather than adds on their total energy .",
    "moreover , near the big rip singularity , we have that the mass of any black hole tends to be @xmath48 which remarkably does not depend on the initial mass of the black hole .",
    "according to babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko [ 8 ] , that result means that all black holes in a universe filled with phantom energy will tend to be equal as the big rip is approached , and that phantom - energy accretion prevails over hawking radiation , at least if quantum - gravity effects are not taken into account . in their original derivation ,",
    "babichev et al .",
    "[ 8 ] obtained exactly the same conclusions by using a simpler expression for the scale factor .",
    "one could still wonder , what happens with black holes after the big rip . according to eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) , just after the big rip the mass of the black holes would start increasing and tend to the finite maximum value given by eq . (",
    "2.7 ) as @xmath21 , such as it happens in the case of dark energy with @xmath10 .",
    "the memory of the initial mass would thus be recovered , even though the regions before and after the big rip are mutually disconnected .",
    "further generalization of these results can be achieved by considering the case where a positive cosmological constant @xmath49 is added to the dark energy fluid .",
    "this situation would describe a schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime embedded in dark energy .",
    "if we set a vanishing initial time , @xmath50 , the scale factor @xmath31 then reads [ 15 ] @xmath51}\\left(e^{3(1+\\omega)\\sqrt{\\lambda}t/2}- ce^{-3(1+\\omega)\\sqrt{\\lambda}t/2}\\right)^{2/[3(1+\\omega ) ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath52 with @xmath15 the assumed initial value of the scale factor at the onset of the phantom energy dominance .",
    "since we always have @xmath53 , a big rip singularity for the phantom regime where @xmath1 is also predicted in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "actually , that singularity takes in this case place at a finite time given by @xmath54 which becomes shorter as the value of the cosmological constant is made larger .",
    "the field theory can also be solved in this case .",
    "following the same procedure as for the scale factor ( 2.3 ) we now attain @xmath55 @xmath56 also in this case the phantom regime can be obtained by introducing the conditions @xmath39 and @xmath1 . once again",
    "both the resulting field and its potential tend to blow up as the big rip is approached .    using solution ( 2.9 ) we can now obtain from eqs .",
    "( 2.2 ) and ( 2.5 ) that in the presence of a cosmological constant the accretion of dark energy onto a black hole makes its initial mass @xmath43 to vary according to the law @xmath57 where now @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , again @xmath4 remains all the time equal to @xmath43 if only a cosmological constant @xmath11 is present . for @xmath10 , @xmath4",
    "again monotonically increases with time @xmath17 towards a maximum @xmath59 , which also occurs at @xmath60 . for @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( 2.12 ) can be cast in the form @xmath61 in this case @xmath4 once again decreases with time @xmath17 , tending to vanish on the neighborhood of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , all the qualitative behaviours obtained from solution ( 2.3 ) are matched when one uses solution ( 2.9 ) .",
    "the effect induced by the presence of an extra cosmological constant is to make @xmath4 evolve exponentially .",
    "actually , it can be shown that in the phantom regime corresponding to all existing dark - energy models , the above result is always obtained , provided that regime will show a big rip singularity in the finite future .",
    "in fact , tachyon like models admit [ 18 ] a scale factor solution as given by eq .",
    "( 2.9 ) , and therefore we obtain again for these models result ( 2.13 ) .",
    "since generalized chaplygin phantom models do not show any big rip singularities [ 19 ] , we are finally left only with k - essence models with non - canonical kinetic energy [ 20 ] for which there will be a big rip future singularity in the phantom region and this can be defined by [ 21 ] @xmath62 with @xmath63 a constant satisfying @xmath64 , and @xmath65 the hubble parameter defined from the scale factor @xmath66 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 denotes the arbitrary time at which big rip takes place . inserting the latter two expressions into eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) we finally obtain after integration @xmath68 in which now @xmath69 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) is formally the same as the expression derived in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] for a differently defined @xmath70 , so confirming and generalizing to all phantom models characterized by the existence of a sudden big rip singularity in the finite future the result pointed out in that reference .",
    "we finally solve the field theory for this case .",
    "once we have wick rotated the field @xmath71 , we get @xmath72 @xmath73 we note that in this case , whereas the phantom field diverges at the big rip , the phantom field potential tends to vanish at that singularity .      the results on accretion of dark energy onto black holes first obtained by babichev et al [ 8 ] and generalized above could however get into serious conflict with thermodynamics .",
    "first of all , one could always assume the current existence of primordial black holes which , at the onset of dark energy domination , could have reached a very small mass and hence a very large temperature due to a long process of hawking thermal evaporation .",
    "this would , in principle , imply that hawking radiation effects would by now prevail over the effects of the accretion of phantom fluid if this accretion was characterized by a lower positive temperature [ 22 ] . on the other hand",
    ", one should also expect that if the results derived in subsec .",
    "ii b hold , then the generalized entropy [ 23 ] defined for the whole universe , @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the entropy of the phantom fluid and the entropy of the black hole ) , should be expected to decrease with time , so violating the generalized second law [ 23 ] . in what follows we are going to show nevertheless that none of these two apparent difficulties actually matters because , contrary to a recent claim [ 22 ] , the temperature of the phantom fluid is definite negative , and this will allow us to re - interpret results from a different , `` quantum '' standpoint .",
    "lima and alcaniz have recently proposed a general thermodynamic theory for dark energy , according to which they argue [ 22 ] that , whereas the temperature for the phantom energy regime is always positive , its entropy is negative definite and that , therefore , a cosmic scenario in which the universe is filled with phantom energy should be ruled out . there",
    "exist however rather general thermodynamic arguments which are valid for all available cosmic phantom - energy models , which appear to prevent the holding of that conclusion .",
    "thus , if the first law of thermodynamics is assumed to hold in every involved case , then it has been shown [ 24 ] that in a general friedmann - robertson - walker flat universe filled with a dark energy that satisfies the equation of state @xmath0 ( with @xmath25=constant ) , the entropy density @xmath77 per comoving volume stays always constant [ 24 ] , while the temperature of the universe turns out to be given by the expression @xmath78 , with @xmath79 an integration constant .",
    "thus , we can generally write for the temperature of a universe equipped with a dominating dark energy and equation of state @xmath0 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a positive constant . the interpretation of this result can obviously resort to the most commonly used concept of kinetic temperature which is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy of the system . in the case of a general dark - energy scalar field @xmath71",
    ", the kinetic term @xmath82 can be obtained from the definition of the field itself in terms of the pressure @xmath83 and energy density @xmath84 , the equation of state @xmath0 , and the expression of the energy density derived by integrating the conservation law for cosmic energy , i.e. eq . ( 2.5 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath85 .",
    "now , an estimate of the isotropic translational kinetic energy is @xmath86 ( with @xmath87 a numerical constant ) , which can in fact be made the same as eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) .    along the present paper",
    "we shall take the general expression ( 2.17 ) as the temperature that characterizes a universe dominated by dark energy .",
    "we next derive from eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) thermodynamic functions of interest .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( 2.5 ) and ( 2.17 ) will allow us to readily get the following generalized stefan - boltzmann law for a dark energy universe , @xmath88 we notice that , whereas for @xmath11 @xmath84 becomes a simple constant ( which actually corresponds to a cosmological constant ) , for @xmath16 , eq .",
    "( 2.18 ) consistently reduces to the usual law for radiation , and for @xmath89 the dark energy density decreases with the temperature .",
    "however , for the phantom regime where @xmath1 , in order to preserve @xmath84 positive , we must necessarily take @xmath90 , which is a condition that really directly stems from eq . ( 2.17 ) for @xmath1 .",
    "it follows that @xmath84 will always increase with @xmath91 along the entire phantom regime .",
    "the energy of such a regime actually is bounded from above and allows therefore the occurrence of negative temperatures [ 25 ] . since on",
    "the phantom regime @xmath84 increases with the scale factor @xmath31 it also follows that @xmath91 increases as the universe expands on that regime .",
    "these two characteristics are quite surprising actually and therefore they should be added to the increasing collection of phantom weird properties .    finally , a general expression for the entropy of a dark energy universe can also be obtained by using the procedure of ref . [ 22 ] which in the present case leads to @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a positive constant and @xmath94 is the volume of the considered portion within the dark energy fluid .",
    "thus , contrary to the claim in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] , the entropy of a dark - energy universe is _ always _ positive , even on the phantom regime . actually , by inserting eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) into eq . ( 2.19 ) one in fact attains that @xmath75 becomes a constant when we take @xmath94 to be the volume of the entire universe . for usual radiation corresponding to @xmath16 ,",
    "entropy and temperature can be linked by means of the general relationship , entropy @xmath95 energy / temperature . according to eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) , however , that relationship should be generalized to read : entropy @xmath95 ( 1+@xmath25)energy / temperature , according to which entropy is positive along the entire interval of conceivable values of parameter @xmath25 .    even though it is not very common in physics and",
    "could thereby be listed as just another more weird property of the phantom scenario , a negative temperature is not at all unphysical or meaningless [ 26 ] .",
    "nuclear spin and other quantum systems with negative temperatures have already been observed in the laboratory and interpreted theoretically . as referred to the case of phantom energy , the existence of a negative temperature",
    "would imply that the entropy of a phantom universe monotonically decreased if one would be able to supply energy to that universe .",
    "hence , the onset at the coincidence time of the dominance of a phantom energy , @xmath1 , universe would imply the emergence of a necessarily `` hotter '' cosmic evolution regime in such a way that , if two copies of the current universe were taken , one with positive and other with negative temperature , and put them in thermal contact , then heat would always flow from the negative - temperature universe into the positive - energy universe .",
    "it could yet be argued that negative temperature is a quantum - statistical mechanics phenomenon and therefore can not be invoked in the classical realm .",
    "however , the negative temperature for the universe given by eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) when @xmath1 [ 16 ] can still be heuristically interpreted along a way analogous to how e.g. black hole or de sitter temperature can be interpreted ( and derived ) without using any quantum - statistical mechanics arguments ; that is by simply wick rotating time , @xmath96 , so that the metric becomes positive definite , and checking that in the resulting euclidean framework @xmath97 is periodic with a period which precisely is the inverse of the hawking temperature [ 27 ] .",
    "thus , the euclideanized black hole turns out to be somehow `` quantized '' .",
    "similarly in the present case , the phantom regime can be obtained by simply wick rotating the classical real scalar field [ 28 ] , @xmath39 , which can be generally seen to be equivalent to rotating time so that @xmath96 , too ( see sec .",
    "it is in this sense that the phantom energy universe can be also regarded as a somehow `` quantized '' system and that the emergence of a negative temperature in the phantom regime can be interpreted in a consistent way .",
    "since a system with negative temperature is `` hotter '' than any other systems having positive temperature ( i.e. energy will always flow from the former to the latter system ) , even if that positive temperature is @xmath98 [ 9,26 ] , we see that the first of the two thermodynamical difficulties pointed out before becomes fully solved , no matter how high the black hole temperature could be . concerning the second of the above difficulties ,",
    "let us notice on the other hand that , if the universe is assumed to contain a black hole of mass m , the entropy of the dark energy fluid will be smaller than that is given by ( 2.19 ) for @xmath99 . in this case",
    ", the entropy of the universe can be written to be @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the volume occupied by the black hole and @xmath94 is the volume of the entire universe .",
    "thus , for @xmath10 , @xmath75 decreases and , for @xmath1 , @xmath75 increases as dark energy is accreted onto the black hole .",
    "moreover , after varying @xmath75 with respect to @xmath102 and multiplying by @xmath103 , one can obtain from eq .",
    "( 2.20 ) @xmath104 in which @xmath105 and the upper sign corresponds to @xmath10 and the lower sign corresponds to @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if on the black - hole spacetime we assume the time taken by a light signal to travel along the entire hole to be @xmath106 , we can derive from eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) @xmath107 where @xmath76 and @xmath108 are the entropy and temperature of the black hole .",
    "let us first analyze the total balance of entropy in the case of dark energy with @xmath10 .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ) we see that the accretion of a given amount of dark energy onto the black hole leads to an increase of dark energy entropy which will exceed the corresponding decrease of black hole entropy , so preserving the second law , provided that @xmath109 , i.e. if @xmath110 , a condition which appears to be of general applicability along the latest accelerating evolution of the universe",
    ". it would be in this case expected however that the competion between dark energy accretion and black hole thermal emission , both characterized by positive temperatures , will be governed by usual thermodynamic laws .",
    "thus , if initially @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 ) , then thermal emission will prevail over dark energy accretion and the black hole mass decreased initially .",
    "that situation could nevertheless be maintained only for a while because , during accelerating expansion , temperature ( 2.17 ) will increase at a much greater rate than black hole temperature did due to thermal evaporation .",
    "thus , after a given time , both processes would first tend to balance one another , to inexorably allowing then for dominance of the dark energy accretion process , leading finally to a maximum black hole mass given by eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) . if initially we already had @xmath113 , then dark energy accretion prevailed over thermal radiation along the entire evolution , so that the mass of the black hole steadily increased up to @xmath114 .    as to the case of phantom energy for @xmath1",
    ", we ought to recall that according to the carnot equality the coupling between a negative - temperature system and a a positive - temperature system leads to a carnot engine of greater than 100 percent efficiency [ 29 ] .",
    "thus , in the present case @xmath115 so that the generalized entropy @xmath74 ought to inexorably decrease along phantom energy accretion , so violating the second law .",
    "in fact , eqs . ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ) tell us that in the phantom case the entropy @xmath75 increases by an amount which is smaller than the decrease of @xmath116 provided the reasonable condition @xmath117 is again applied .",
    "this violation of the second law was to be expected because , as it was mentioned earlier , negative temperatures are compatible with observationally checked `` quantum '' carnot equalities violating the second law [ 29 ] . in any event ,",
    "the implication that negative temperatures lead through the quantum carnot engine to violation of the second law can be argued under several presumptions . although discussing these arguments is clearly outside the scope of the present paper , we want to leave open the possibility that they might preserve the second law even in the case being considered .",
    "one very remarkable property of phantom energy is worth mentioning here .",
    "even though most of its properties might be weird , phantom energy seems to be able to elegantly solve one of the most conspicuous and debated paradoxes of all the physics .",
    "in fact , if all existing black holes will simultaneously disappear at the big rip leaving no hawking radiation , then the information initially lost during formation of the black holes should somehow be recovered .",
    "actually , the so - called quantum coherence loss paradox , long championed by hawking [ 30 ] and according to which an initial pure state is transformed into a final mixed state , during the whole process of black hole formation and subsequent complete evaporation , is here naturally solved in at least the phantom - energy regime in the sense that neither hawking radiation nor black holes are left in the final singular state where only the big rip singularity plus a naked black hole singularity could take place .",
    "thus , even in the classical case , the information paradox appears to be solved .      at first sight",
    ", one could be tempted to dismiss eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) because a spacetime dominated by a cosmological constant has a nonzero temperature of the order of the hubble constant @xmath65 while , according to eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) the temperature of a fluid with @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "if by instance we take for the scale factor the expression ( 2.3 ) , then as one approaches the value @xmath11 that expression can be reduced to @xmath118 , and hence it becomes @xmath119 at the special case where @xmath11 .",
    "in such a case we have then @xmath120 , while for @xmath121 the hubble parameter is time - dependent and given by the expression @xmath122 .",
    "thus , whereas in the first case we have a cosmological horizon of radius @xmath123 which is characterized by a surface gravity @xmath124 , no constant horizon can be defined for any @xmath121 in which cases every point is subject nevertheless to an isotropic acceleration which can be given by @xmath125 .",
    "each of these two cases has therefore a distinct expression for temperature : if @xmath11 the surface gravity implies a temperature @xmath126 [ 27 ] ; if however @xmath121 then every accelerating point will be bathed by a thermal radiation at the quantum unruh temperature [ 31 ] @xmath127 , which is precisely the expression given by eq .",
    "it follows that , even though the gibbons - hawking temperature for event horizons and the unruh temperature for accelerating systems are conceptually equivalent as the surface gravity is nothing but a measure of how hard you have to accelerate to stay a given short distance away from the horizon , de sitter space must be endowed with a temperature @xmath128 but not with temperature @xmath129 , and those spacetimes with @xmath121 have in turn a temperature @xmath130 but not temperature @xmath131 .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( 2.17)-(2.19 ) are valid only for @xmath121 .",
    "the above discussion makes it clear that these equations are not mere definitions devoid of physical significance , but they all possess a precise physical meaning .",

    "therefore , the equation of state @xmath135 , together with the conservation law for cosmic energy , suffice by themselves to determine the thermodynamic properties of a general relativistic fluid which is assumed to dominate in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe , much as e.g. the gravitational characteristics of black holes or de sitter space are now known to determine well - defined and precise laws of thermodynamics , provided quantum theory is taken into account .",
    "as represented by a stuff governed by the conservation law for cosmic energy and satisfying a perfect fluid equation of state the way we have considered so far , dark energy can be looked at as being a generalized radiation field whose characteristics are fixed by the value of parameter @xmath25 .",

    "it is in this sense that we shall consider in what follows that a universe dominated by dark energy is equivalent to a universe dominated by radiation .",
    "the concepts of negative temperature and negative entropy are both meaningless within the realm of classical thermodynamics .",
    "the mathematical definition of entropy can not in fact accommodate negative values both in statistical thermodynamics and in the shannon theory of information , where the entropy ( respectively denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath131 ) is given by the conventional equivalent formulas @xmath161 with @xmath162 the boltzmann constant , @xmath163 a given constant usually assumed to be unity , @xmath164 the probability of any given microstate , and @xmath141 the probability of the signal given the reference class of possible signals that could have been sent .",
    "the fact that @xmath164 and @xmath141 can not exceed unity makes it impossible to have finite negative values for @xmath75 and @xmath131 in the classical theory .",
    "however , more recent developments have shown that quantum theory can allow the emergence of both negative temperatures and negative entropies .",
    "cerf and adami studied [ 32 ] what happens to the shannon theory when qubits of quantum information are accounted for . in doing that these authors extended classical probabilities to function describing also the quantum characteristics of the system , including both bits and qubits , within a consistent density - matrix description that otherwise parallels classical shannon theory .",
    "a rather tantalizing implication from that generalization is that negative entropies crop up in the case of quantum systems having no classical analog .",
    "in particular , it was shown [ 33 ] that entropy becomes negative when two particles are quantum - mechanically entangled , even though that does not violate special relativity .",
    "on the other hand , the occurrence of negative absolute temperatures has already become a little bit more conventional [ 26 ] .",
    "these take also place in quantum systems or phenomena without classical analog , e.g. in quantum nuclear spin systems [ 34 ] , and their existence has already been experimentally checked [ 34 ] .",
    "we shall now contend that at least in systems which admit a statistical thermodynamic description , negative temperature implies negative entropy , in the following sense .",
    "given the specific properties of the `` log '' function ( which actually relate characteristics of linear evolution with characteristics of nonlinear evolution ) , one can still introduce a tentative statistical definition of the entropy function which encompasses both positive and negative values of temperature and entropy simultaneously . using the formula for carnot efficiency @xmath165 one",
    "can actually introduce a new entropy formula @xmath166 we notice that eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) connects the statistical content of entropy with its purely thermodynamic meaning , as it can now be checked by considering a small variation of @xmath167 which , if @xmath168 , by eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) induces a small decrease of entropy , such that @xmath169 . in any event , if we assume that @xmath170 , then the efficiency @xmath171 and the entropy as defined by eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) becomes negative .",
    "it follows that a negative temperature would imply a negative entropy , except in the case that the system exchanges negative amounts of internal energy , for which case eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) no longer holds and must be replaced for @xmath172 eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) would in turn predict that a negative temperature @xmath173 must imply a positive entropy .",
    "that is precisely the case to which phantom energy belongs . or more precisely , phantom energy must be regarded as a quantum entity with no classical analog , which is characterized by a negative temperature given by eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) and a positive entropy given by eq . ( 2.19 ) .",
    "if we would for a moment adhere to the alternate alcaniz - lima view [ 22 ] , then the phantom energy would still be a quantum entity without classical analog , but characterized now by a positive temperature and a negative entropy . the difference with the interpretation provided in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] is that in the present scenario having a phantom negative entropy is not necessarily physically meaningless due to the essential quantum nature of the phantom fluid .",
    "we are going next to establish in exactly what sense the phantom fluid can be considered as a quantum entity .",
    "it is known [ 7 ] that in order to preserve weak energy condition , @xmath9 , the phantom scalar field should be wick rotated ( e.g. @xmath174 ) . as pointed out in sec .",
    "ii , we can readily check that such a rotation is equivalent to wick rotating the time @xmath17 itself ( e.g. [ 35 ] @xmath175 ) , while preserving the field unchanged .",
    "thus , in the present general dark - energy scenario , the scalar field @xmath71 is expressed in terms of time @xmath17 as [ 7 ] @xmath176 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 , @xmath177 and @xmath28 are the initial values of the scale factor , the scalar field and the energy density , respectively , with @xmath178 the planck length . in the case that @xmath1 it",
    "can be readily seen that eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) can be approximated to @xmath179 along the entire cosmic evolution ending at the big rip . from eq .",
    "( 3.6 ) we can in fact deduce that wick rotating @xmath71 while keeping @xmath17 unchanged is equivalent to wick rotating time @xmath17 while keeping @xmath71 unchanged .",
    "now , it is well known that a euclideanized spacetime metric would describe a somehow quantized system [ 27 ] .",
    "it is in this sense that the cosmic phantom fluid is a quantized entity ; that is , in a way which would parallel e.g the procedure through which the quantum temperature and entropy of black holes can be derived by simply wick rotating time in the maximally extended kruskal metric [ 27 ] .",
    "once we have made a preliminary discussion of some quantum properties of the cosmic phantom field , let us consider the simplest case in which the universe is initially filled only with phantom stuff .",
    "if we then add an elementary piece of ordinary matter to this observationally empty universe , according to our discussion before , the entropy would drop down , meaning that at least a bit ( or qubit ) of information necessarily about the added particle has been created and is available to potential observers ( note that essentially no direct information can be made available on the phantom fluid as this is not directly observable by definition ) .",
    "this is exactly the opposite to what would occur if such an elementary piece of matter with positive energy is added to a universe filled with dark energy with @xmath10 , in which case the entropy of the universe increased .",
    "the creation of negative entropy in the case of a phantom fluid can not be interpreted as being due to the creation of entangled correlations between the added particle and all `` phantom quanta '' as this implied knowledge about phantom being available to potential observers .",
    "imagine now the onset of phantom energy domination in our real universe .",
    "the above reasoning would lead to the idea that a huge amount of bits and qubits of information about all observable pieces of matter encountered by the phantom field at the start of its domination would then be created and made available to potential observers .",
    "this is what can be dubbed as phantom - energy induced cosmological information .",
    "it actually calls for the presence of observers if one appeals to a general principle for natural economics .",
    "an important point should be mentioned at this point .",
    "it is that once phantom energy starts dominating in the universe , as its temperature is negative , and hence `` hotter '' than anything observable , it will gravitationally be ceacelessly accreted onto all kinds of observable matter steadily annihilating it , all the way until the big rip at which point all of the matter in the universe , including black holes , will completely disappear . neither the above available cosmological information nor this process of all matter annihilation would nevertheless be present if instead of phantom energy the universe were filled with a dark energy vacuum component having @xmath10 .",
    "another standpoint from which one can look at the question of cosmic phantom energy is the very concept of life and its origin . in his rather controversial book ``",
    "what is life ? '' , which collected a series of lectures delivered in dublin , schrdinger posed [ 36 ] a key conclusion that , a way or another , remains still inescapable today : what a living organism feeds upon is negative entropy , and this in its very statistical thermodynamic sense .",
    "that is currently interpreted by considering that living beings necessarily produce a positive supply of entropy to the universe during their vital activities which would compensate the needed stream of negative entropy upon themselves .",
    "however acceptable this may be for keeping the second law alive , it goes without solving the key question : for an essential element of life to make its first appearance in the universe , the site where it appeared ought to be prepared to provide the necessary and immediate supply of negative entropy for the incipient life element to continue , as in this case `` egg would precede hen '' .",
    "thus , since any living organisms are made up of positive energy , while original life elements could not be consolidated if the universe was then filled with any form of dark energy with @xmath180 , it can perfectly do so in a universe filled with phantom energy , as in this case the very act of the organism appearance does imply a supply of negative entropy .",
    "on the other hand , as discussed before , an universe filled with phantom energy is also prepared to be observed .",
    "it is in these senses that it could be thought that any form of anthropic principle [ 37 ] had to be formulated in terms of the emergence of an epoch when the universe started to be dominated by phantom energy .",
    "we shall apply in this and the next sections some aspects of the thermodynamic theory for @xmath181-fluid developed by lima and maia [ 38 ] to the case of a general quintessential model of dark energy and , in particular , to the case of phantom energy . according to the discussion in sec .",
    "ii we can assume that the dark - energy field corresponds to a kind of radiation field with a wien - type spectrum given by @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a positive constant , @xmath184 is the frequency , @xmath103 is absolute temperature , and the parameters @xmath185 and @xmath186 will be determined by imposing the two following constraints to be satisfied by eq .",
    "( 4.1 ) @xmath187 @xmath188 which respectively define the energy density and the particle number density . following lima and maia",
    "[ 38 ] , let us then define a new variable @xmath189 , so that the constraints ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.3 ) can be re - cast as @xmath190 @xmath191 where we have used eq . ( 4.1 ) . from eqs .",
    "( 4.4 ) and ( 4.5 ) we can finally deduce that @xmath192 and @xmath193 and , therefore , our generalized wien law is given by @xmath194 which , as expected , reduces to the known wien law for blackbody radiation if we set @xmath16 .",
    "we note then that the temperature should not appear as simply @xmath103 but always in the combination @xmath195 ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , both in the energy density @xmath196 and in the energy density @xmath197 . we can therefore write the wien spectrum ( 4.1 ) for the phantom energy case as @xmath198 and hence using the same procedure as before , we recover the same wien law , but referred to absolute value of temperature , also for a phantom radiation , i.e. for @xmath1 and @xmath199 , @xmath200 this actually gives the most general expression for the wien law and is valid for any positive and negative value of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "let us consider a set of two level systems characterized by the resonant frequency @xmath184 , immersed in phantom radiation at negative temperature @xmath199 .",
    "assuming the simple dipole - moment approximation we label the energy levels of the system by @xmath201 and @xmath202 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , with @xmath203 . following a line of reasoning analogous to that which led einstein to introduce his celebrated absorption and emission coefficients [ 39 ] , we can now assume the occurrence of novel radiative processes if the radiation field is made up of a substance characterized by an equation of state with @xmath1 .",
    "in that framework the probability that a system is in the energy level @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) is given by @xmath206     population of given energy levels in the cases that : ( left ) @xmath10 and hence @xmath207 , and ( right ) @xmath1 and hence @xmath199 . the area of the circles over the energy levels would qualitatively be proportional to the population . ]    where @xmath208 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath209 is the temperature - independent statistical weight of the _ i_th state .",
    "now , due to the presence of phantom energy which would only exchange discrete amounts of negative internal energy @xmath210 with the level systems , there will be three new einstein - like coefficients , here denoted by @xmath211 , @xmath212 and @xmath213 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . @xmath213 will correspond to a spontaneous absorption coefficient which would be evaluable from first principles using quantum mechanics and happens in the absence of any phantom radiation , but creates quanta of phantom energy ; @xmath211 is a new induced emission coefficient and @xmath212 is a new stimulated absorption coefficient .",
    "the latter two coefficients would only occur in the presence of phantom radiation .",
    "these three coefficients will be related with the following rates of probability transition . @xmath214 @xmath215 @xmath216    thus",
    ", an equilibrium condition can be introduced in the considered system which reads @xmath217 and if the approximation @xmath218 is applied , then @xmath219 , and hence @xmath220 where we have used @xmath221 . comparing with the generalized wien law ( 4.8 ) , we finally obtain a generalized planck law , with [ 34 ] @xmath222 @xmath223 being the average occupation number , and finally @xmath224 where the case of fermions has been also included .",
    "the law ( 5.9 ) is the most general planck law and can be applied to radiation characterized by an equation of state @xmath0 , where @xmath25 can take on any positive or negative value .",
    "pictorial representation of the possible radiative processes induced by phantom radiation on a two - level system as expressed in terms of the einstein - like coefficients : @xmath213 for spontaneous absorption , @xmath211 for induced absorption , and @xmath212 for stimulated absorption .",
    "no stimulated emission can take place in the presence of phantom energy with negative temperature . ]    as a test of consistency we finally calculate e.g. @xmath197 from eq .",
    "( 5.9 ) for the fermion case .",
    "we in fact obtain @xmath225 where @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the gamma and zeta functions [ 40 ] , respectively . that is the result what was to be in fact expected .    before closing up this section",
    "we would like to briefly comment on the effect that negative phantom temperatures may have on laser effect .",
    "in fact , it is well known that laser theory is based on the occurrence of stimulated emission which , together with population inversion , leads to the necessary coherent radiation amplification leading to the laser operation . in the case of negative phantom temperature ,",
    "even though population inversion is guaranteed , there is anything like a stimulated emission and lasing can never be produced .",
    "what one could instead suppose is the possibility for a contrary or anti - lasing process .",
    "if in our negative temperature system one would restore a larger population in the lower energy level by the use of an appropriate procedure , then stimulated absorption would produce a damping , rather than amplification , of the coherent radiation .",
    "the construction of such an anti - laser , or more properly `` lasar '' ( light attenuation by stimulated absorption of radiation ) , device could be of some usefulness in atomic and molecular physics .",
    "on the other hand , stimulated absorption processes might provide a clue for explaining the lack of phantom - energy radiative processes in cosmology .",
    "there have been two recent important contributions to the question of the thermodynamics of dark energy .",
    "on one hand , alcaniz and lima [ 22 ] derived general dark energy thermodynamic expressions that , when extended to the phantom regime , implied positive values for its temperature and negative values for its entropy . by using two independent compelling arguments , here it is nevertheless shown that what becomes negative in the phantom regime is temperature , while entropy is kept definite positive along the entire range of negative state equation parameter . in any event , since classically having either a negative entropy or a negative temperature , or both , makes no physical meaning , the first obvious conclusion seems to be that phantom energy can not exist .",
    "this situation is somehow reminiscent to the one which was posed in the mid - seventies when it was first realized that the black hole entropy had to be finite [ 41 ] . hawking himself",
    "has many times stressed [ 42 ] that , at that time , it seemed that since black hole can not emit anything classically , such a conclusion was meaningless , too .",
    "the solution to this paradoxical situation was , as it is now widely acknowledged , to appeal to the quantum nature of black holes which allowed them to radiate thermal particles .",
    "we argue in this paper that the solution to the above apparent phantom thermodynamic paradox is again by appealing to the essential quantum nature of the phantom stuff .",
    "in fact , if , in spite of by definition violating the dominant energy condition , i.e. @xmath3 , phantom energy is consistently assumed to satisfy the weak energy condition , @xmath9 , then it can be interpreted that the phantom spacetime becomes euclideanized and this is known to provide the natural framework where quantum temperature and quantum entropy can be consistently defined [ 27 ] ; i.e. the cosmic phantom fluid can be essentially regarded as a quantum system having not any classical analogs .",
    "now , negative temperatures ( or even entropies ) can perfectly exist in the quantum realm .",
    "it is in this way that the above thermodynamic phantom paradox is solved in the present paper .",
    "our conclusion thus is that there can exist a cosmic quantum field characterized by a temperature that is always negative and a positive definite entropy , and that , moreover , if the universe would happen to be currently dominated by such phantom energy , then this would introduce a universal element of cosmological information that would make every piece of observable matter to be really observable and allow the very existence of living organisms in the universe . on the other hand , when considering accretion of phantom energy onto black holes , babichev , dokuchaev and eroshenko have showed [ 8 ] that the mass of the black holes undergo a gradual decrease and tend all to zero at the big rip . in this work",
    "we confirm and extend that result , consistently interpreting it in terms of the above conclusion on phantom thermodynamics .",
    "this realization is important in at least two respects .",
    "it firstly implies that once black holes are formed before or after phantom energy domination , all known evolution processes of existing black holes become inexorably dominated by phantom energy accretion and finally subject to what could be dubbed as a `` democracy before death '' principle by which such black holes are all equalized before disappearing all at once at the big rip , no matter their initial mass or the time when they were formed .",
    "the reason of such a domination of phantom energy accretion ( which actually extends over any emission processes of any observable matter system ) essentially resides on the fact that , however small its absolute value may be , a negative temperature is always hotter than any positive temperature , even if this is infinite .",
    "secondly , it is also a conclusion of the present paper that , since the phantom - induced annihilation process prevails always over hawking thermal emission , during the whole black hole evolution process leading from formation to final disappearance , quantum coherence is preserved , as in this case neither the black hole nor any thermal radiation emitted from it is left in the final state .",
    "this offers a rather comfortable solution to the so - called black - hole information paradox [ 27 ] and becomes still another positive consequence from the existence of phantom energy in the universe .",
    "the formulation of some main theoretical basis for establishing the quantum statistic thermodynamics of phantom energy has been also aimed at in this work . by assuming that any form of dark energy can be taken to be a radiation field , we have thus considered a generalized wien law and hence a generalized planck radiation law .",
    "these laws turn out to be described by the same general expressions as for the usual dark energy case first derived by lima and maia [ 38 ] , but referred to the absolute value of phantom temperature .",
    "this conclusion comes about as a consequence from the necessary introduction of novel einstein coefficients and the different probability law for the case of phantom energy .",
    "the extra einstein coefficients correspond to new radiative processes that include a stimulated absorption phenomenon , which would attenuate the intensity of the phantom radiation .",
    "it will only be by collecting more cosmological data that we will be able to finally decide on whether or not phantom energy is the form of dark energy that currently operates in the universe to drive its observed accelerating expansion .",
    "however , even in the event that other kind of dark energy turned out to be the favoured stuff dominating the current universe , there could still be sufficient room for phantom energy to dominate over all other cosmic stuffs during other epochs along the universal evolution , including the primordial inflationary period , such as has been recently suggested [ 43 ] .",
    "anyway , we hope that the contents of the present paper may help to convince cosmologists that , whatever the final conclusion on the above subjects may be , phantom energy is a physical concept with sufficient theoretical interest by itself as to pursue active research on it .",
    "we thank professors lima and babichev for useful explanations , discussions and correspondence .",

    "<S> this paper deals with the thermodynamic properties of a phantom field in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe . </S>",
    "<S> general expressions for the temperature and entropy of a general dark - energy field with equation of state @xmath0 are derived from which we have deduced that , whereas the temperature of a cosmic phantom fluid ( @xmath1 ) is definite negative , its entropy is always positive . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret that result in terms of the intrinsic quantum nature of the phantom field and apply it to ( i ) attain a consistent explanation for some recent results concerning the evolution of black holes which , induced by accreting phantom energy , gradually loss their mass to finally vanish exactly at the big rip , and ( ii ) introduce the concept of cosmological information and its relation with life and the anthropic principle . </S>",
    "<S> some quantum statistical - thermodynamic properties of the quantum quantum field are also considered that include a generalized wien law and the prediction of some novel phenomena such as the stimulated absorption of phantom energy and the anti - laser effect . </S>"
