    "the delta baryons , with spin and isospin @xmath0 , have long been a subject of study  @xcite in qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) , which are a well - established method that links the hadron degrees of freedom with the underlying qcd parameters  @xcite .",
    "an important issue in the analysis of the decuplet baryons as well as of other excited hadrons is their finite widths .",
    "conventionally , the method is to apply the zero - width approximation , where the breit - wigner contributions to the imaginary parts of the correlation functions are represented by @xmath1-functions  @xcite .",
    "however , one can not automatically assume that the contributions of the finite - width effects are negligible .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to go beyond analytical arguments and investigate numerically the finite - width effects on the hadron spectrum in qcdsr .    the finite - width contributions within qcdsr have been considered before in the context of the @xmath2-meson  @xcite and the @xmath2@xmath3 mixing  @xcite .",
    "our aim in this work is to make a reanalysis of the delta sum rules by taking into the account the finite - width effects . for this purpose , we first consider the ` traditional ' sum rules and in order to implement the finite - width effects on the @xmath4 state , we use the method developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was then applied to the first pion excitation state , @xmath5 .",
    "our second aim in this paper is to include the first positive- and negative - parity delta excitation states , @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , within qcdsr analysis as sub - continuum resonances and to extract information about the parameters that characterize these resonances . for this purpose",
    "we resort to the parity - projected sum rules in order to separate the positive- and the negative - parity contributions  @xcite .    for our numerical procedure ,",
    "we use the monte - carlo based analysis introduced in ref .",
    "this method provides a more systematic treatment of uncertainties in qcdsr . on the other hand",
    ", we expect that a monte carlo based analysis can better resolve the discrepancies in the hadron spectrum due to finite - width contributions .",

    "the analyticity of the correlation function allows us to write the phenomenological side of the sum rules in terms of a dispersion relation of the form @xmath18 the ground - state hadron contribution is singled out by utilizing the zero - width approximation , where the hadronic contributions from the breit - wigner form to the imaginary part of the correlation function is proportional to the @xmath1-function : @xmath19 = \\pi\\delta(s - m^2),\\\\          \\text{im}\\,\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}(s)=\\pi\\sum_x\\ , \\delta(s - m_x^2)\\langle 0 |\\eta_\\mu|x\\rangle \\langle x |\\eta_\\nu|0\\rangle .",

    "the resulting width values are in agreement with the experimental result , which is @xmath67  gev as given by pdg  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the overlap amplitude values produced by the fit indicates that the lowest - lying and the first excited states couple to the interpolating current with strengths of the same order .    in this work , we have also analyzed the negative - parity delta states",
    "; however , the scarcity of the experimental information for the negative - parity resonances prevents us from constraining the parameters , which represent these resonances .",
    "particle data group ( pdg ) lists the lowest - lying negative - parity ( @xmath17 ) state as @xmath7 with breit - wigner width of @xmath68  gev .",
    "assuming that the first delta excitation lies in the continuum , we have first applied a two - parameter fit to the lhs of eq .",

    "the relatively high value , at which we have to fix the continuum threshold in order to obtain the experimental mass value of the @xmath7 resonance suggests that the excited - state contributions may not be embedded in the continuum and therefore the qcdsr analysis can not be limited to the lowest - lying resonance .",

    "we obtain @xmath81  gev , which favors a large value for the width of @xmath78 . despite the naive analysis as a result of the large uncertainties in the phenomenological input , our results for the negative - parity delta resonance parameters are consistent with those given by pdg  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the finite - width effects on the qcd sum rules of the delta baryons , through explicit utilization of the breit - wigner shape .",
    "we have observed that although the finite - width effects give minor contributions to the traditional sum rules ( about @xmath82 change in the @xmath4 mass value ) , the effects on the parity - projected sum rules are rather significant ( about @xmath83 change in the @xmath4 mass value ) .",
    "the deviations from the narrow - resonance approximation in qcdsr analysis leads to results in better agreement with the experiment for the parity - projected case .",
    "our findings for the width of the @xmath4 resonance from a monte carlo analysis of the parity - projected sum rule are in agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the first positive - parity delta excitation , @xmath6 , has also been considered as a sub - continuum resonance using parity - projected qcdsr , and its breit - wigner width has been calculated , where the experimental width value has been produced . for both resonances , in order to analyze the mass - width correlation , we allowed a variation in the input mass and the width values .",
    "we have found that while the masses are insensitive on a width variation for small width values , the uncertainties in the widths are increased with respect to a mass variation .",
    "this in turn means that the boundaries are more restrictive for the mass and less for the width .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the masses increase with the increasing widths and the lowest mass is given by the calculation of the spectral function with a @xmath1-function representation . for the negative - parity case ,",
    "large experimental uncertainties prevent us from constraining the input parameters , therefore only a naive analysis can be made . a reasonable agreement with the experimental values",
    "has been obtained though , which favors a large value for the breit - wigner width of the @xmath78 resonance .",
    "it is desirable to extend this analysis to all decuplet baryons and their excited states .",
    "a work along this line is still in progress ."
