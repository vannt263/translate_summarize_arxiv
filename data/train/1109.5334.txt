    "tensor network states are powerful variational anstze that can be used to characterize the low - energy properties of quantum many - body systems on a lattice .",
    "the premise of tensor network approaches is to parameterize a many - body wave - function by using a collection of tensors connected into a network .",
    "the number of parameters required to specify these tensors is much smaller than the exponentially large dimension of the system s hilbert space , in such a way that very large ( and even infinite ) lattices can be considered .",
    "tensor network states can be broadly classified into two sets according to the geometry of the underlying networks @xcite . in the first set ,",
    "the network reproduces the _ physical geometry _ of the system , as specified by the pattern of interactions in the hamiltonian .",
    "for instance , the matrix product state ( mps ) @xcite , an ansatz for @xmath0 dimensional systems , consists of a collection of tensors connected into a chain ; similarly , its generalization for lattices in @xmath1 dimensions , known as projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite , consists of a collection of tensors connected according to a @xmath2 dimensional lattice .",
    "in contrast , a second class of tensor network states aim at reproducing the _ holographic geometry _ of the system .",
    "the latter spans an additional dimension used to parameterize the different length scales ( or , equivalently , energy scales ) relevant to the description of the many - body wave - function .",
    "thus the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite for a lattice system in @xmath2 dimensions consists of a network in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "the simplest and most widely employed tensor network state is the mps .",
    "the mps underlies the remarkable success of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm @xcite , which for almost two decades has dominated the numerical study of @xmath0 dimensional quantum systems , providing very accurate results for low energy properties .",
    "dmrg has not only become ubiquitous in condensed matter physics but has also found application in other fields involving quantum many - body systems , such as quantum chemistry @xcite . further algorithms based upon the mps",
    "have also been developed , such as the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) @xcite algorithm , later reformulated as time - dependent dmrg @xcite , which allows the simulation of certain low - energy _",
    "dynamics _ for relatively long times .    in this manuscript",
    "we discuss the application of the mera to study critical systems in @xmath0 dimensions ( although most of the present formalism is directly applicable to @xmath1 dimensions ) .",
    "given the success of mps - based methods such as dmrg and tebd for quantum systems in @xmath0 dimensions , it is natural to ask whether an alternative approach is actually needed .",
    "a clear answer to this question is obtained by discussing the short - comings of the mps representation for critical systems as well as by exploring the benefits of including scale invariance directly into a tensor network state , something that is possible with the mera but not the mps .",
    "critical systems typically lack a characteristic length scale and are thus invariant under changes of scale .",
    "one manifestation of scale invariance in critical systems is that correlators decay polynomially , in sharp contrast with gapped systems , where they decay exponentially with a characteristic correlation length .",
    "it is well - known , however , that an mps with a finite bond dimension @xmath4 ( where @xmath4 indicates the size of the tensors ) can never properly capture the scale invariance of a critical state .",
    "indeed , a duly optimized mps possesses an intrinsic finite correlation length @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 is a constant that depends on the universality class of the phase transition under consideration , such that correlators decay exponentially at length scales larger than @xmath7 .",
    "thus , while the mps can accurately approximate short - range properties of a critical ground state , it necessarily fails to capture its properties at asymptotically large distances .",
    "[ in practice , however , the cost of mps - based approaches scales only as @xmath8 with the bond dimension @xmath4 .",
    "this means that one can use a very large value of @xmath4 , which often allows the critical behavior of a system to be accurately captured up to some very large length scale @xmath7 . ]    on the other hand , the mera can explicitly capture the scale invariance of critical systems @xcite , a feature that has significant advantages , both conceptual and practical .",
    "tensors in the mera are organized in layers , where each layer corresponds to a different length ( or energy ) scale . in an infinite system , scale invariance",
    "is then easily enforced by choosing all layers of tensors to be identical .",
    "the resulting ansatz is referred to as the _ scale - invariant _ mera .",
    "certain structural properties of the scale - invariant mera , such as the polynomial decay of correlators and the logarithmic growth of block entanglement entropy @xcite , already hint at its suitability to represent critical systems .",
    "in addition , this ansatz offers direct access to the scaling operators of a critical theory , namely those operators that transform into themselves under scale transformations . as a scale - invariant / covariant object , a scaling operator must act non - trivially on a region of the system that has no characteristic length scale . in a @xmath9-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft )",
    "@xcite ( corresponding to the continuum limit of a critical quantum system in @xmath0 spatial dimensions ) , the support of a scaling operator can therefore only be one of three possibilities : ( i ) an infinite line , ( ii ) a single point , or ( iii ) a semi - infinite line .",
    "the first type of support corresponds to a global internal symmetry of the cft s hamiltonian .",
    "the second type of support is seen to correspond to local scaling operators , associated to local excitations .",
    "finally , the third type corresponds to non - local ( or semi - local ) scaling operators , associated e.g. to domain wall excitations .",
    "going back to the lattice , scaling operators are distorted by the presence of a finite lattice spacing , but they can still be directly extracted from the scale - invariant mera .",
    "thus , on the lattice , ( i ) a global internal symmetry is implemented by an infinite string of identical single - site operators ; ( ii ) local scaling operators are now supported on a small number of sites ( the specific number depends on the mera scheme ) ; and ( iii ) non - local operators mix elements of the two previous objects : they consist of a semi - infinite string of identical single - site operators ( the same ones that implement an internal symmetry ) completed with some local operator at the end of the string .",
    "importantly , the scaling dimensions and fusion rules of the scaling operators on the lattice are the same as in the continuum . as a result ,",
    "a relatively simple and inexpensive calculation with the scale - invariant mera can be used to obtain remarkably accurate estimates of the conformal data characterizing the underlying cft .",

    "that this relation held over a range of bond dimensions between @xmath123 and @xmath282 , it seems likely that the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath254 is indeed linear , or at least very close to linear for ground states of critical systems .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : densityspect ] , which plots the spectrum of one - site and two - site density matrices for @xmath126 quantum xx model , where it can seen that choosing @xmath281 is sufficient to ensure that the truncation error @xmath277 is of the same order as the smallest eigenvalue of the one - site density matrix .",
    "thus , though not rigorously justified , the available evidence indicates that @xmath280 may be chosen as @xmath267 , hence the overall cost of optimizing the modified binary mera has been reduced to @xmath253 cost .",
    "the reduction in cost comes at the price of both introducing new tensors @xmath257}$ ] that must be updated with each iteration and introducing a controlled amount of approximation into the tensor network contractions .",
    "although we have only described how the cost of the modified binary mera scheme can be reduced through introduction of a projector @xmath259 into the tensor network diagrams , the same approach could be employed to potentially reduce the cost of any mera scheme .",
