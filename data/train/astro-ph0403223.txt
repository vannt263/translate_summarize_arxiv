    "observations of the most distant @xmath21 qsos ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "2002 ) show near - complete absorption at wavelengths shortward of lyman-@xmath14 ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) , suggesting an optical depth in this line that implies a smooth neutral hydrogen fraction which is increasing rapidly with redshift at this epoch .",
    "temperature - polarization cross - correlations in the cosmic microwave background from _ wmap _ indicate that the universe was completely neutral at redshifts of @xmath22 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although there is a growing consensus that cosmic reionization occurred in the redshift interval @xmath23 , a second key question is the nature of the sources responsible for this landmark event .",
    "optical and x - ray studies to @xmath19 suggest the abundance of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at early epochs is insufficient when account is taken of the relevant unresolved backgrounds ( barger et al .",
    "a more promising source is star - forming galaxies whose early ancestors may be small and numerous .",
    "along with the escape fraction for the ionizing photons from the massive and short - lived ob stars in such sources , a major observational quest in this respect is a determination of the global star formation rate at early epochs .    in previous papers , our group has extended the _ lyman - break _ technique ( steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) to address this question . using the advanced camera for surveys",

    "2002 ) on the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) with the sharp - sided sdss f775w ( @xmath0 ) and f850lp ( @xmath2 ) filters , we located `` @xmath24-drop '' candidates with @xmath2525.6 at @xmath19 for further study . in a series of papers",
    ", we have shown that this selection technique can effectively locate @xmath26 galaxies using acs images from the _ hst _ treasury `` great observatory origins deep survey '' ( goods ; giavalisco & dickinson 2002 ) .",
    "on the basis of goods - south photometric catalogues published by stanway , bunker & mcmahon ( 2003 , hereafter paper i ) , spectroscopic follow - up using keck / deimos and gemini / gmos field demonstrated our ability to find high redshift galaxies ( bunker et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper ii ; stanway et al .",
    "to address potential cosmic variance issues , we performed a similar analysis in the goods - north field , which yielded a consistent estimate of the surface density of @xmath19 star forming sources ( stanway et al .",
    "2004b , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "although our initial study ( papers i - iii ) revealed the importance of ascertaining the difficult spectroscopic verifications , and highlighted the problem of contamination from galactic stars , we nonetheless determined that the abundance of confirmed star forming galaxies at @xmath27 must be less than that expected on the basis of no evolution from the well - studied @xmath28 lyman break population ( steidel et al .",
    "working at the robustly - detected bright end of the luminosity function , in paper  i we showed that the comoving star formation density in galaxies with @xmath29 is @xmath30 _ less _ at @xmath1 than at @xmath8 .",
    "our @xmath29 flux limit corresponds to @xmath31 at @xmath32 , equivalent to @xmath33 at @xmath8 .",
    "in papers i  iii we restricted our analysis to luminous galaxies ( where we take `` luminous '' to mean @xmath34 for the rest - uv ) .",
    "other groups have claimed less dramatic evolution or even no evolution in the volume - averaged star formation rate , based on the same fields ( giavalisco et al .",

    "2004 ) and similar _",
    "hst_/acs data sets ( bouwens et al .  2003 ; yan , windhorst & cohen 2003 ) , but these groups work closer to the detection limit of the images and introduce large completeness corrections for the faint source counts .",
    "the major uncertainty in converting the abundance of our spectroscopically - confirmed sample in the goods fields into a @xmath19 comoving star formation rate is the form of the luminosity function for faint , unobserved , sources . as discussed in paper  iii ,",
    "if the faint end of the luminosity function at @xmath35 was steeper than that at lower redshift , or if @xmath36 was significantly fainter , a non - evolving star formation history could perhaps still be retrieved .",
    "the public availability of the hubble ultra deep field ( udf ; beckwith , somerville & stiavelli 2003 ) enables us to address this outstanding uncertainty . by pushing the counts and the inferred luminosity function of @xmath0-band drop - outs at @xmath1 to a limiting lower luminosity equivalent to one well below @xmath37 for the @xmath8 population , it is possible to refine the integrated star formation rate at @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we set out to undertake the first photometric analysis of @xmath0-drops in the udf .",
    "our primary goal is to understand the abundance of fainter objects with characteristics equivalent to those of @xmath19 sources and address uncertainties in the global star formation rate at this redshift .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we describe the imaging data , the construction of our catalogues and our @xmath0-drop selection . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss the luminosity function of star - forming sources , likely contamination on the basis of earlier spectroscopic work , and estimate the density of star formation at @xmath1 .",

    "the udf was observed at two main orientations differing by 90 degrees , and within each of these data was taken in 2 blocks rotated by 4deg ( orientations of 310,314,40&44deg ) .",
    "a 4-point dither box spanning 0.3arcsec was used , with half - pixel centres to improve the sampling . during each `` visit '' , there were 3 larger 3arcsec dithers to span the wfc inter - chip gap .    for our analysis",
    "we use the reduced udf data v1.0 made public by stsci on 09 march 2004 .",
    "the pipeline reduction involved bias / dark current subtraction , flat - fielding , and the combination of background - subtracted frames rejecting cosmic ray strikes and chip defects .",
    "the resulting reduced images had been `` drizzled '' ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) using the `` multidrizzle '' software ( koekemoer et al .",
    "2004 ) on to a finer pixel scale of @xmath49 , to correct for geometric distortion and to improve the sampling of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the udf data has been placed on the same astrometric system as the goodsv1.0 images of the udf .",
    "the photometric zeropoints adopted were those provided by stsci for the udf v1.0 data release : 25.673 , 26.486 , 25.654 & 24.862 for the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath0 & @xmath2 filters , where @xmath50 .",

    "as we are searching specifically for objects which are only securely detected in @xmath2 , with minimal flux in the @xmath0-band , fixed circular apertures @xmath54 in diameter were trained in the @xmath2-image and the identified apertures used to measure the flux at the same spatial location in the @xmath0-band image by running sextractor in two - image mode . for object identification",
    ", we adopted a limit of at least 5 contiguous pixels above a threshold of @xmath55 per pixel ( @xmath56 ) on the data drizzled to a scale of 003  pixel@xmath57 .",
    "this cut enabled us to detect all significant sources and a number of spurious detections close to the noise limit .",
    "as high redshift galaxies in the rest - uv are known to be compact ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 , bremer et al .",
    "2004 , bouwens et al .",
    "2004 ) , we corrected the aperture magnitudes to approximate total magnitudes through a fixed aperture correction , determined from bright compact sources : @xmath58mag in @xmath0-band and @xmath59mag in @xmath2-band , the larger latter correction arising from the more extended psf wings of the @xmath2-band .",
    "the measured noise in the drizzled images underestimates the true noise as adjacent pixels are correlated . to assess the true detection limit and noise properties , we examined the raw acs / wfc images from the _ hst _ archive and measured the noise in statistically - independent pixels . for the 144-orbit @xmath2-band",
    ", we determine that the @xmath3 detection limit is @xmath4 for our @xmath54-diameter aperture .",
    "this is consistent with the noise decreasing as @xmath60 from the 5-orbit goodsv1.0 to the 144-orbit udf @xmath2-band .",
    "we adopt this high @xmath61 cut as our conservative sample limit .",
    "we trimmed the outermost edges where fewer frames overlapped in order to exploit the deepest udf region , corresponding to a survey area of 11arcmin@xmath12 . from the output of sextractor we created a sub - catalogue of all real objects brighter than @xmath10mag ( @xmath3 in a @xmath54-diameter aperture ) ,",
    "of which 63 appear to be promising @xmath0-band dropouts ( see @xmath622.3 ) with @xmath11 .",
    "to quantify possible incompleteness in this catalogue , we adopted two approaches .",
    "first we examined the recovery rate of artificial galaxies created with a range of total magnitudes and sizes .",
    "we used de vaucouleurs @xmath63 and exponential disk profiles , convolved with the acs / wfc psf derived from unsaturated stars in the udf images .",
    "secondly we created fainter realisations of the brightest @xmath0-dropout in the udf confirmed to be at high redshift ( sbm03#1 with @xmath64 , confirmed spectroscopically to be at @xmath65 by stanway et al .",
    "2004b ; dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) . by excising a small region around this @xmath0-dropout , scaling the sub - image to a fainter magnitude , and adding it back into the udf data at random locations , we assessed the recoverability as a function of brightness . for such objects we recover 98% of the simulated sources to @xmath4 ,",
    "the remainder being mainly lost via source confusion through overlapping objects . from these analyses ,",
    "we determine that , for unresolved sources ( @xmath66 ) , we are complete at our @xmath3 limit of @xmath4 , and are 97% complete at this magnitude for @xmath67 ( figure  [ fig : completeness ] ) . for objects with larger half - light radii we will underestimate the @xmath2-band flux due to our @xmath54-diameter photometric aperture .",
    "however , this effect is small for our sample of compact sources ( table  1 lists both the @xmath68-diameter magnitudes with an aperture correction which we adopt , and the sextractor `` mag_auto '' estimate of the total magnitude using a curve - of - growth : these are broadly consistent ) .    at the relatively bright cut of @xmath29 used in paper  i from the goodsv0.5 individual epochs ,",
    "the udf data is 98% complete for sources as extended as @xmath69arcsec .",
    "interestingly , we detect no extended ( low surface brightness ) @xmath0-drops to this magnitude limit in addition to sbm03#1 ( papers  i , iii ) in the deeper udf data .",
    "this supports our assertion ( paper  i ) that the @xmath0-drop population is predominantly compact and there can not be a large completeness correction arising from extended objects ( c.f .",
    "lanzetta et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the acs imaging is of course picking out hii star forming regions , and these uv - bright knots of star formation are typically @xmath70kpc ( @xmath71 at @xmath1 ) even within large galaxies at low redshift .      in order to select @xmath1 galaxies , we use",
    "the lyman break technique pioneered at @xmath72 using ground - based telescopes by steidel and co - workers and using _ hst _ by madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . at @xmath28",
    "the technique involves the use of three filters : one below the lyman limit ( @xmath73 ) , one in the lyman forest region and a third longward of the lyman-@xmath14 line ( @xmath74 ) . at @xmath1",
    ", we can efficiently use only two filters , since the integrated optical depth of the lyman-@xmath14 forest is @xmath75 ( see figure  [ fig : filters ] ) rendering the shortest - wavelength filter below the lyman limit redundant .",
    "the key issue is to work at a sufficiently - high signal - to - noise ratio that @xmath0-band drop - outs can be safely identified through detection in a single redder band ( i.e. , sdss-@xmath2 ) .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated to be effective by the sdss collaboration in the detection of @xmath1 quasars using the @xmath0- and @xmath2-bands alone ( fan et al .",
    "the sharp sides of the sdss filters assist in the clean selection using the photometric redshift technique . in figures  [ fig : tracks]&[fig : izzcolmag ] we illustrate how a colour cut of @xmath76 ( used in papers  i - iii ) can be effective in selecting sources with @xmath26 . here we relax this cut to @xmath11 to recover most galaxies at redshifts @xmath77 , but at the expense of potentially larger contamination by @xmath78 ellipticals .",
    "near - infrared colours from the nicmos imaging of the udf should identify these extremely red objects ( eros ) , and we consider this in a companion paper ( stanway , mcmahon & bunker 2004c ) .",
    "six of the 63 candidate @xmath0-dropouts in our @xmath10 udf catalogue were identified visually as different regions of the same extended source , and where these were within our aperture diameter of @xmath54 the duplicates were eliminated from the final selection .",
    "one spurious @xmath0-drop arose from the diffraction spikes of bright stars due to the more extended psf in the @xmath2-band compared with that in the @xmath0-band .",
    "only one of the @xmath0-dropouts is unresolved ( figure  [ fig : fwhm ] ) .",
    "this is the brightest at @xmath79 ( # 11337 in table  1 ) , detected in the @xmath44-band image and removed from our catalogue of potential @xmath1 objects as a probable star . at the edge of the udf frame ( and outside the central 11arcmin@xmath12 region of lowest noise where we do our main analysis ) there is a second unresolved @xmath0-drop with @xmath80 , first identified in paper  i ( sbm03#5 ) , where we argued that the near - ir colours are likely to be stellar .",
    "it is interesting that the level of stellar contamination in the udf @xmath0-drops is only 2% , compared with about one in three at the bright end ( @xmath29 , papers i & iii ) .",
    "this may be because we are seeing through the galactic disk at these faint magnitudes to a regime where there are no stars at these faint limiting magnitudes .    from our original list of 63 @xmath0-drops ,",
    "6 duplications were removed , along with one diffraction spike artifact .",
    "the remaining objects satisfying our @xmath11 & @xmath10 selection criteria are detailed in table  1 , of which 54 are good candidate @xmath1 galaxies , along with the probable star # 11337 , and another objected ( # 46574 ) detected in @xmath44-band .",
    "the surface density of @xmath0-drops as a function of limiting magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : numcounts ] .",
    "none of the @xmath0-drops ( with the exception of the galactic star ) are detected in the @xmath43-band image of the udf , to a @xmath81 limit of @xmath82 in a 05-diameter aperture , as would be expected for the @xmath1 interpretation where the @xmath43-band filter covers wavelengths below the 912  lyman limit .",

    "indeed , the spatial distribution of our @xmath0-drops on the sky does indicate some clustering ( figure  [ fig : distribution ] ) , and we had already flagged 6 of our candidates as being `` double '' sources ( table  1 ) , with another 2 having near neighbours . in the glare gmos / gemini spectroscopy of the goods - south @xmath0-dropouts , stanway et al .",
    "( 2004a ) have already spectroscopically identified an overdensity at @xmath188 .",
    "the increased depth of the udf enables us to resolve the uncertainties associated with the unobserved portion of the luminosity function ( lf ) for @xmath1 sources .",
    "our best - fit lf suggest little or no change in @xmath13 over @xmath189 , with @xmath14 less well constrained but consistent with modest evolution , implying the major evolution is a decline in space density ( and global star formation rate ) by @xmath190 at @xmath1 .",
    "this sharp decline , which must represent a lower limit to the true decline given the likelihood of contamination from foreground sources , suggests it may be difficult for luminous star - forming @xmath1 @xmath24-dropout galaxies to be the main source of ionizing photons of the universe .",
    "we attempt to quantify this by comparing with the estimate of madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) for the density of star formation required for reionization ( their equation 27 ) : @xmath191 this relation is based on the same salpeter initial mass function as we have used in deriving our volume - averaged star formation rate .",
    "@xmath192 is the concentration factor of neutral hydrogen , @xmath193 .",
    "simulations suggest @xmath194 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "our comoving star formation rate of @xmath195 from the @xmath0-drop galaxies we detect is a factor of @xmath196 lower than the original madau , haardt & rees ( 1999 ) requirement at @xmath197 .",
    "we have updated their equation 27 for the more recent concordance cosmology estimate of the baryon density of spergel et al.(2003 ) , @xmath198 , and for the predicted mean redshift of our sample ( @xmath199 ) : @xmath200    the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath201 ) for high - redshift galaxies is highly uncertain ( e.g. , steidel , pettini & adelberger 2001 ) , but even if we take @xmath202 ( no absorption by h  i ) this estimate of the star formation density required is a factor of @xmath203 higher than our measured star formation density of @xmath17 at @xmath1 from galaxies in the udf with sfrs@xmath204 . for faint end slopes of @xmath205 galaxies with @xmath206 account for @xmath207% of the total luminosity , so would fall short of the required density of lyman continuum photons required to reionize the universe .",
    "if the faint - end slope is as steep as @xmath208 then there would just be enough uv lyman continuum photons generated in star forming galaxies at @xmath1 ( assuming a salpeter imf ) , but the requried escape fraction for complete reionization would still have to be implausibly high ( @xmath209 , whereas all high-@xmath135 measurements to date indicate @xmath210 : fernnadez - soto , lanzetta & chen 2003 ; steidel , adelberger & pettini 2001 ) .",
    "agn are also under - abundant at these epochs ( e.g. , dijstra , haiman & loeb 2004 ) . if star forming galaxies at redshifts close to @xmath160 were responsible for the bulk of reionization , then a very different initial mass function would be required , or the calculations of the clumping factor of neutral gas would have to be significantly over - estimated . alternatively another low - luminosity population ( e.g. , forming globular clusters ; ricotti 2002 ) could be invoked to provide some of the shortfall in ionizing photons .",
    "it is also plausible that the bulk of reionization occured at redshifts well beyond @xmath160 : the wmap polarization data indicate @xmath211 ( kogut et al .  2003 ) , and it is possible that the gunn - peterson troughs seen in @xmath212 qsos ( becker et al .",
    "2001 ; fan et al .",
    "2002 ) mark the very last period of a neutral igm .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions as follows :    1 .",
    "we present an @xmath0-dropout catalogue of @xmath1 star forming galaxy candidates in the ultra deep field ( udf ) to a limiting flux ( @xmath3 ) of @xmath10 .",
    "this represents a substantial advance over the depths achieved in the goods catalogues and enables us , for the first time , to address questions concerning the contribution of the faint end of the luminosity function . 2 .",
    "we detect 54 resolved sources with @xmath11 in the deepest 11arcmin@xmath12 portion of the udf and consider this to be an upper limit to the abundance of star forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "3 .   using simulations based on lower redshift data , we deduce that , regardless of contamination by foreground interlopers , the abundance of @xmath0-dropouts detected is significantly less than predicted on the basis of no evolution in the comoving star formation rate from @xmath161 to @xmath160 ( integrating to the same luminosity level ) .",
    "the udf data supports our previous suggestions that the star formation rate at @xmath1 was about @xmath16 _ less _ than at @xmath8 ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ) .",
    "the inferred comoving star formation rate of @xmath17 from @xmath213 galaxies at @xmath1 may poses a significant challenge for models which require that luminous star forming galaxies in the redshift range 6@xmath21410 are responsible for reionizing the universe .",
    "the contamination of our @xmath0-drop sample of candidate @xmath1 galaxies by cool galactic stars appears to be minimal at @xmath215 , possibly because we are seeing beyond the galactic disk at the faint magnitudes probed by the udf .",
    "a recent preprint by yan & windhorst ( astro - ph/0407493 ) independently repeats our selection of candidate @xmath1 galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field with @xmath216 ( astro - ph/0403223 and this paper ) .",
    "the yan & windhorst catalogue also pushes to fainter magnitudes than our @xmath10 limit , where the completeness corrections become significant .",
    "this subsequent independent analysis recovers almost all of our original @xmath0-band drop - out galaxies , and the catalogues agree at the 98% level ( one discrepant object out of 50 ) . in astro - ph/0407562 ( bunker & stanway 2004 ) we present a matched catalogue of these @xmath24-band dropouts in the hubble ultra deep field .",
