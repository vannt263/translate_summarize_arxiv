    "both a spectroscopic and photometric homogeneous databases are available : the purpose of this study is to exploit them to perform a thorough analysis of the morphology of the rgb as a function of the cluster s metallicity . as a first step , we want to obtain a new improved calibration of a few classical photometric metallicity indices .",
    "secondly , we want to provide to the community a self - consistent , * analytic , * family of giant branches , which can be used in the analysis of old stellar populations in external galaxies .",
    "photometric indices have been widely used in the past to estimate the mean metallicities of those stellar systems where direct determinations of their metal content are not feasible . in particular , they are used to obtain @xmath13\\textrm { } $ ] values for the farthest globulars and for those resolved galaxies of the local group where a significant pop  ii is present ( e.g. the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ) .",
    "the calibration of @xmath0 indices is particularly important , since with comparable exposure times , deeper and more accurate photometry can be obtained for the cool , low - mass stars in these broad bands than in @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , our huge cmd database allows a test of the new cg scale on a large basis : we are able to compare the relations obtained for both the old zw and new scale , and check which one allows to rank ggcs in the most accurate way . indeed , the most recent calibration of the @xmath0 indices ( carretta & bragaglia @xcite ) is based on just 8 clusters .",
    "a reliable metallicity ranking of ggc giant branches also allows studies that go beyond a simple determination of the _ mean _ metallicity of a stellar population . as an illustration",

    "we will show here that such relatively simple mono - parametric function can actually be obtained , and that this progress is made possible thanks to the homogeneity of both our data set and analysis .    in order to enforce a proper use of our calibrations ,",
    "we must clearly state that , in principle , the present relations are valid only for rigorously old stellar populations ( i.e. for stars as old as the bulk of galactic globulars ) . at fixed abundance ,",

    "the blue tail of the metal poorest clusters does not reach the horizontal part of the branch : in that case , a fiducial hb was fitted to the tail , and the magnitude of the horizontal part was taken as the reference level .",
    "the fiducial branch was defined by taking a cluster having a bimodal hb color distribution ( ngc  1851 , cf .",

    "our quadratic calibration vs. the zw scale has a residual _ rms _ scatter of 0.13  dex , which is the same of the linear relation on the cg metallicity vs. @xmath103 .",
    "the lee et al .",
    "relation ( dashed line ) predicts slightly too larger metallicities on the zw scale , for @xmath104>-1 $ ] .",
    "this can also be interpreted as if the da90 47  tuc branch were @xmath123 mag bluer than ours . indeed , if one looks at fig .",
    "5 of da90 , one can easily see that some weight is given to the brightest rgb star , which is brighter than the trend defined by the previous ones .",
    "the result is a steeper branch , which also justifies the da90 slightly bluer rgb fiducial . since our metal richest point is defined by two clusters , and since the two measured parameters agree very well , we are confident that our calibration is reliable . in any case , the discrepancy between the two scales is no larger than @xmath94  dex .",
    "it is also reassuring that the caldwell et al .",
    "( @xcite ) relation ( pluses ) is closer to the present calibration , since the former is based on a larger set of clusters .",
    "this might be an indication that the lee et al .",
    "relation is actually inaccurate at the metal rich end , due to the small set of calibrating clusters .",
    "as before , we obtained a further calibration also using the c99 @xmath116 vs. [ fe / h ] relation ; the quadratic fit on the zw scale has a residual _ rms _ scatter of 0.13  dex , while the @xmath103 variable can be fitted with a straight line , with an _ rms _ of 0.14  dex .      for any @xmath126 index , the quadratic relations vs. the zw metallicity do not improve the _",
    "rms _ and they are not plotted in the figures . the coefficients are listed in table  [ t : rms ] .",
    "the best metallicity estimates of the `` @xmath126 family '' are obtained with the @xmath3 index . the errors on @xmath11",
    "$ ] are just slightly larger than the standard uncertainties of the spectroscopic determinations .",
    "the solid lines of fig .",
    "[ f : caldv14 ] show the calibrations that we obtain .",
    "the quadratic equation on the cg scale , and the linear one on the zw scale , are obtained with residual scatters of 0.16  dex .",
    "the rest of the indices in this family , and @xmath127 , lack the precision of the other abundance indicators .",
    "this is due to the fact that the error on any @xmath126 index is proportional to the uncertainty on the color of the rgb ( which depends on the reddening ) , times its local slope where the reference point is measured .",
    "since the rgb slope increases going away from the tip ( i.e. towards bluer colors ) , we expect that the scatter on the @xmath126 indices will also increase as the color of the reference point gets bluer .",
    "indeed , table  [ t : rms ] shows that in most cases the _ rms _ uncertainties are @xmath128  dex for these indices .",
    "the residual scatter is largest for the @xmath127 index , which is the most affected by the uncertainties on the reddening .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath127 parameters have been earlier calibrated , on the cg scale , by carretta & bragaglia ( @xcite ) . using their quadratic relation for @xmath6 , and both their linear and quadratic relations for @xmath127 , the corresponding _",
    "rms _ of the residuals in metallicity are 0.21  dex and @xmath129  dex , respectively .",
    "our new and the old calibrations are therefore compatible , within the ( albeit large ) uncertainties .",
    "a straightforward test of our new analytic rgbs can be made by generating the same metallicity indices that have been measured on the observed rgbs , and then checking the consistency of the predicted vs. measured quantities . to this aim , for a set of discrete [ fe / h ]",
    "values a @xmath130 vector was generated , and the combination of the two was used to compute the @xmath131 vector of the giant branch , using eqs .",
    "( [ e : general]-[e : d ] ) . then for each branch the metallicity indices were measured as it was done for the clusters fiducials .    in figs .",
    "[ f : cals ] to [ f : caldv14 ] , the predicted indices are identified by the small open squares ( spaced by 0.1  dex ) connected by a solid line .",
    "the best predictions are for those indices that rely on the brightest part of the rgb ( i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath132 ) , while the computations are partially discrepant for those indices that rely on a point that is measured on the faint rgb .",
    "this is easily explained by the nature of our fit : since the best match is searched for along the ordinates ( for the reasons discussed in sect .",
    "[ s : newda90 ] ) , then it is better constrained in the upper part of the rgb , where its curvature becomes more sensitive to metallicity .",
    "we must also stress that the metal richest cluster in the reference grid is 47  tuc ( [ fe / h]@xmath133 on the zw scale ) , whereas ngc  6352 ( [ fe / h]@xmath134 on the same scale ) is the metal richest cluster for which metallicity indices have been measured .",
    "some of the discrepancies that are seen at the highest metallicities are therefore due to the lack of low - reddening clusters that can be used to extend the reference grid to the larger [ fe / h ] values .    the mean differences between the predicted and fitted indices are , on the zw scale , around 0.03  dex for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 indices .",
    "they are around 0.08  dex for the @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 indices .",
    "they rise to @xmath94 and @xmath135  dex for the @xmath2 and @xmath5 indices .",
    "a similar trend is seen for the comparison on the cg scale . in this case , the mean differences are @xmath99  dex for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath1 ; they are @xmath94  dex for @xmath6 and @xmath3 ; and they are 0.12 and 0.27 for the @xmath2 and @xmath5 indices .",
    "we can therefore conclude that , apart from the @xmath2 and @xmath5 indices , our mono - parametric rgb family gives a satisfactory reproduction of the actual changes of the rgb morphology and location , as a function of metallicity .",
    "it is then expected that , using this approach , one can exploit the brightest @xmath136  mags of the rgb to determine the mean metallicity , and even more important , the metallicity _ distribution _ of the old stellar population of any local group galaxy . in a forthcoming paper , we will demonstrate such possibility by re - analyzing our old photometric studies of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies tucana ( saviane et al .",
