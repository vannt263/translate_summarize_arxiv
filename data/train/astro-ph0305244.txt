    "despite the observational and theoretical efforts of the last decades , the evolutionary status of early - type galaxies is still an unsolved problem .",
    "the stellar populations of nearby ellipticals preserve a record of their formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , the study of their element abundance ratios should be a powerful discriminant between different star formation histories ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , this last approach is still at its infancy .",
    "the pioneering works of late 1970s already revealed that abundance ratios in early - type galaxies are often non - solar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since then , several studies have provided compelling evidence of mg / fe overabundances in massive ellipticals as compared with the solar ratio ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which have been interpreted in the light of several possible scenarios based on the understanding that mg is mainly produced in type ii supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however , and in contrast with the above findings , another @xmath3 element , namely ca , seems to be underabundant in ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , challenging current chemical evolution models ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several authors ( @xcite;@xcite ) have also noted a strengthening in other absorption line - strengths , in particular in the ids / lick c4668 and cn@xmath2 indices , when compared with stellar population models predictions .",
    "the variations of these two indices are mainly driven by c and n ( in the case of cn ) abundances ( @xcite ) , which could suggest a possible enhancement of these two elements relative to fe when compared with the solar values .",
    "in contrast with mg , c and n are mainly produced in low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xcite ; @xcite , although there are recent suggestions that most of the c should come from massive stars ) . during the agb phase ,",
    "these stars eject into the ism significant amounts of @xmath4he , @xmath5c , @xmath6c and @xmath7n , enriching the medium from which new stars will be formed .",
    "therefore , it seems difficult to simultaneously reproduce the abundances of all these elements with a simple chemical evolution scenario .",
    "the problem of c and n abundances has been more thoroughly studied in the field of globular clusters .",
    "an interesting puzzling problem is the existence of a cn dichotomy in galactic and m31 globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "although this is a controversial issue , recent works ( @xcite ) tend to favor the scenarios of different abundances in the parental clouds against the ones that predict abundance changes produced internally by the evolution of the stars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "given the expected sensitivities of relative abundances to the star formation history of ellipticals , their study in galaxies within different environments should help to discriminate between different formation and evolution models .",
    "for instance , hierarchical scenarios predict that ellipticals in rich clusters assembled completely at high redshift ( _ z_@xmath83 ) , whereas field ellipticals may have experienced an elapsed and more complex star formation history ( @xcite ) . however , very little is known about the dependence of the relative abundances on environment .",
    "one piece of information is that there is no difference in the [ mg / fe ] ratio between cluster and field elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this letter",
    ", we study the behaviour of several lick / ids indices ( see @xcite for definition ) in a sample of low and high density environment galaxies ( ldeg and hdeg respectively ) and , surprisingly , we do find systematic differences in the strength of c and cn features .",
    "long  slit spectra of 98 early  type galaxies in different environments were taken in four observing runs with two different telescopes .",
    "the sample comprises 59 galaxies from the field and the virgo cluster ( ldeg ) , and 34 galaxies from the central region of the coma cluster ( hdeg ) , spanning a wide range of absolute magnitudes ( @xmath9 , using @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 ) , and central velocity dispersions @xmath12  km  s@xmath11 ( from dwarf ellipticals , in virgo and coma , to giant galaxies ) .    in the first two runs ( 1998 january and 1999 august ) we used the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory ( almera , spain ) , employing the twin spectrograph .",
    "the observations of the third and fourth runs ( 1999 march and 2001 april ) were carried out with the 4.2 m wht at the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) using the isis spectrograph .",
    "spectral resolutions range from 2.6    and 4.0    ( fwhm ) for ldeg to 8.6  for hdeg , in a spectral range @xmath135400   .",
    "exposures times of 12003600 secs per galaxy allowed us to obtain central spectra with signal - to - noise ( @xmath14 ) ratios ( per  ) ranging from 25 to 250 .",
    "we also observed several galaxies in common between runs to ensure that the measurements were in the same system .",
    "@xmath15 stars from the ids / lick library were included to transform the measured line - strength indices to the lick system .",
    "standard data reduction procedures ( flat - fielding , cosmic ray removal , wavelength calibration , sky subtraction and fluxing ) were performed with ( @xcite ) , which allowed a parallel treatment of data and error frames and provided an associated error file for each individual data spectrum .      for each galaxy ,",
    "central spectra were extracted by coadding within a standard metric aperture size corresponding to 4 arcsec projected at the distance of the coma cluster ( simulating in this way a fixed linear aperture of length 1.8 kpc in all the galaxies ) .",
    "velocity dispersions were determined using the movel and optema algorithms described in @xcite .",
    "we measured the lick / ids line - strengths indices , although only cn@xmath2 , mgb , c4668 and @xmath16fe@xmath8 are presented here ( the rest of the indices , with a more detailed explanation of data handling , will be presented in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "all the indices were transformed to the lick spectrophotometric system using the observed stars and following the prescriptions in j. gorgas , p. jablonka , & p. goudfrooij ( 2003 , in preparation ) ; see also @xcite",
    ". using galaxies in common with @xcite and with repeated observations between runs , we double - checked that there are no systematic errors in the indices of galaxies observed in different runs .",
    "all the indices presented in this work are transformed into magnitudes , following @xcite : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the width of the index bandpass .      in fig .",
    "[ todas.sigma.letter ] we present the cn@xmath2 , c4668@xmath19 , mgb@xmath19 , and @xmath0fe@xmath20 indices versus velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) for the 98 galaxies of the sample .",
    "the spectra of three dwarf galaxies from the coma sample did not have enough @xmath14 to derive a reliable measurement of @xmath21 and a typical value of 40  km  s@xmath11 was assumed .",
    "also , for the rest of the galaxies with @xmath22  km  s@xmath11 , we adopted @xmath21 values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is apparent from this figure that galaxies located in low and high density environments show systematic differences in c4668@xmath19 and cn@xmath2 , being the indices in hdeg systematically lower than in ldegs . on the other hand ,",
    "both galaxy subsamples seem to follow similar relationships in the @xmath0fe@xmath20 and mgb@xmath19 versus @xmath21 diagrams .    to quantify the possible systematic differences , we have performed a linear least - square fit to the ldeg subsample , and have measured the mean offsets ( weighting with errors ) of the coma galaxies ( hdeg ) from the fits .",
    "these differences and their errors are indicated within each panel , confirming the high significance of the systematic offsets in cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 .",
    "these systematic differences are also visible directly in the spectra of the galaxies . for illustration ,",
    "[ espectro - figure ] shows the coadded spectra of ldeg ( thin line ) and hdeg ( thick line ) in the range @xmath23  km  s@xmath11 , previously shifted to the same radial velocity and broadened to the maximum @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath14 ratios of the two combined spectra are above 300 .",
    "it is evident that the offsets found in fig .",
    "[ todas.sigma.letter ] are due to real enhancements of the cn band at @xmath24    and the c@xmath2 swan band at 4735  in ldeg compared to hdeg .",
    "note that this effect is also quite remarkable in the cn band around @xmath25    ( not included in the lick system ) .",
    "prior to interpret the systematic differences in cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 as variations on elements abundances , and since the indices are also sensitive to other physical parameters , we have explored further possibilities :    \\(1 ) given the gravity dependences of the cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 indices ( both are stronger in giant than in dwarf stars ; @xcite ) , a decrease in the giant / dwarf ratio in hdeg ( with respect to ldeg ) would lead to lower index values . using the models by vazdekis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we have checked that a change in the exponent of the imf from 0.80 to 2.80 would decrease cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 by 0.033 and 0.009 mag respectively , while the expected changes in mgb@xmath19 and @xmath16fe@xmath8 would be of 0.005 and 0.003 in the opposite sense ( assuming an age of 10  gyr and solar metallicity ) .",
    "these predictions are marginally consistent with our results ( note that the above offsets for mgb@xmath19 and @xmath16fe@xmath8 are compatible with the measurements within the uncertainties ) , thus we can not reject this possibility .",
    "however , this result is in contradiction with other studies ( @xcite ) which suggest a decrease in the giant / dwarf ratio in ldeg compared to hdeg , and would imply important changes in other observables . measurements of the ca triplet in the near - infrared ( with a high sensitivity to the imf ; see @xcite ) should help to discard or confirm this scenario .",
    "\\(2 ) a difference in ( luminosity - weighted ) mean age between hdeg and ldeg could also introduce systematic offsets in cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 between both galaxy samples . under this scenario , and using the models by v96",
    ", the observed offsets could be accounted for if hdeg were about 8 gyr younger than ldeg .",
    "this possibility can be rejected since it would imply a decrease in mgb@xmath19 and @xmath16fe@xmath8 of 0.026 and 0.014 in hdeg compared with ldeg , which is not observed .",
    "furthermore , it contradicts previous findings which suggest that hdeg are , in any case , older than ldeg ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the most plausible explanation of our results is that variations in the relative abundances of c and n with respect to mg and fe are responsible for the observed offsets between galaxies in different environments .",
    "[ index - index ] compares the observed cn@xmath2 and c4668@xmath19 with the predictions of stellar population models .",
    "this figure clearly shows that the previously found overabundances of c and n only stand for ldeg , while hdeg tend to exhibit relative abundances closer to the solar partition .",
    "the c4668@xmath19 index is extremely sensitive to carbon changes , so little variations in carbon abundance can change this index dramatically ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the variations of cn are mostly controlled by n , because extra c is readily incorporated into co but extra n makes more cn molecules .",
    "therefore , a change in both c and n abundances is required to explain our results . besides , if extra carbon is easily incorporated into co , one should detect an enhancement in the strength of the co bands in ldeg compared to hdeg .",
    "this effect has indeed been found by @xcite comparing the co band at 2.3@xmath26 m in galaxies from the field and from the pisces and abell  2634 clusters .",
    "they interpreted this difference as an evidence of intermediate - age stellar population in ldeg ( through a major contribution of agb stars ) . although we do not discard a larger contribution of younger populations in ldeg compared to hdeg",
    ", our results in the blue spectral range imply that their observations can be solely explained by a relative abundance difference . in any case",
    ", the observed offsets can not be due to an age effect alone ( see above ) .",
    "the most plausible scenario to explain the differences in relative abundances is the one in which ldeg and hdeg have experienced different star formation histories . in particular , since the ism is progressively enriched in c and n by stars of low and intermediate mass stars , hdeg should have been fully assembled before the massive release of these elements .",
    "the hierarchical clustering paradigm currently predicts that galaxies in clusters formed at different epochs than ldegs .",
    "if the time elapsed between the assembling of the former and the later is enough to permit the c and n enrichment of the ism of the pre - merging building blocks in ldeg , the stars formed in these galaxies during the merging events will be c and n enhanced .",
    "the constancy of the iron - peak elements could be understood if , in both environments , the mergers take place before type - i sn can significantly pollute the ism of the pre - merging blocks .",
    "additionally , hdeg could have experienced a truncated star formation and chemical enrichment history compared to a more continuous time - extended history for their counterparts in low density environments . however , under this hypothesis , there should be an increase of magnesium ( produced by type - ii sn ) in ldeg which is not detected .",
    "one way to understand the constancy of the mgb@xmath19 index could be to invoke the imf - metallicity relationship suggested by @xcite , in which the succesive episodes of star formation in ldeg would take place with lower giant - to - dwarf ratios .    to conclude ,",
    "we have noted for the first time a systematic difference in the element abundance ratios of galaxies situated in different environments .",
    "these differences impose strong constraints to models of chemical evolution and galaxy formation .",
    "it is clear that more work is still needed to completely understand the causes of the differences .",
    "in particular , it would be very interesting to compare the cn@xmath2 and c4668 indices between the central regions and the outskirts of the coma cluster , where @xcite found differences in the strength of the near - ir co molecule .",
    "also , the detailed study of other dense clusters is highly needed to confirm whether this effect is particular of the coma cluster .",
    "we are indebted to r. guzmn for providing us with a catalogue of dwarf elliptical galaxies in the coma cluster .",
    "the wht is operated on the island of la palma by the royal greenwich observatory at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias .",
