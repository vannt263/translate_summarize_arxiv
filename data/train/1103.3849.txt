    "the spectroscopy and ordering of nucleon single - particle levels along extended isotopic chains is of importance for understanding emerging and dissolving shell structures . one- and two - nucleon removal reactions from fast rare - isotope beams are making a significant contribution to such studies in some of the rarest isotopes  @xcite .",
    "this information , in turn , allows an assessment of shell model effective interactions and of their predictions near both the weakly- and strongly - bound fermi - surfaces in highly neutron - proton asymmetric nuclei . by their nature",
    "these nucleon removal reactions preferentially populate states in the heavy residual nuclei with a strong hole - like parentage upon the projectile ground state . for the spectroscopy of particle - like states , light - ion single - nucleon transfer reactions , such as the @xmath3 reaction , are very often the reaction of choice .",
    "these reactions are best and most often carried out at relatively low incident energies such that linear and angular momentum matching and hence the reaction yields are optimal .",
    "the beam intensity , ( thin ) target , and detection system demands for such measurements , of final - state - resolved transfer cross section angular distributions in inverse kinematics , are however high and such studies remain impractical , currently , for many of the most exotic nuclei .    in this paper we consider test case measurements and associated direct reaction model calculations for reaction events in which a single neutron is picked up by a fast secondary beam of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the measurements employ thick targets and @xmath0-ray spectroscopy and thus take full advantage of fast beams produced by fragmentation ; the resulting high luminosity allows for experiments with low incident beam rates  @xcite .",
    "related previous studies @xcite considered reactions involving the pickup of a strongly bound proton from a be target . here",
    "we discuss first measurements for a mg beam of about 84  mev per nucleon incident energy .",
    "an important aspect of the present analysis is that measurements are made using both carbon and beryllium reaction targets , with very different neutron structures .",
    "two of our primary aims here are to investigate ( a ) the nature of the fast pickup reaction mechanism , and ( b ) the magnitudes of the measured and calculated pickup reaction yields . in doing so",
    "we hope to gain a first insight into the potential to use such reactions , in combination with @xmath0-ray spectroscopy of the populated mass @xmath5 final states , to determine quantitative particle state spectroscopy information on exotic nuclei produced at energies of order 100  mev per nucleon .",
    "specifically , we aim to clarify if the reaction proceeds predominantly by a direct single - particle pickup mechanism and , if this is the case , to quantify the measured and calculated cross sections for transfers involving different orbital angular momenta @xmath2 .",
    "such information will illustrate , for instance , the capability for future measurements to identify high-@xmath2 neutron intruder components in the low energy spectra of the pickup residues .",
    "since such high-@xmath2 intruder configurations are typically angular momentum mismatched , they are more weakly coupled and populated in lower energy @xmath3 transfer reactions .",
    "we make clear in advance that the fast nucleon pickup events considered here are not well - matched in either transferred linear or angular momentum , in the sense used in semi - classical model discussions of transfer reactions between heavy ions  @xcite .",
    "we also make clear that the @xmath6 mg residues in the present analysis , having a high first nucleon threshold , do not permit a detailed or quantitative spectroscopy in this case .",
    "our aims here are more modest and were stated above .",
    "in addition , to help direct future experiments , we assess the effectiveness of our two light target choices : ( a ) @xmath7c , that makes available four well - bound @xmath8 neutrons with a ground - state separation energy of @xmath9  mev , and ( b ) @xmath10be , that offers one weakly - bound valence neutron of @xmath11  mev , while @xmath12  mev , in providing a source of neutrons with sufficiently high momentum components to contribute strength to the pickup reaction yields .",
    "we will show that the measured and calculated pickup reaction yields and the @xmath6 mg residue momentum distributions measured on the two targets help to provide such a clarification and guide to future studies .",
    "the projectile beam of was obtained by fragmentation of a 170-mev per nucleon primary beam provided by the coupled cyclotron facility at the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory ( nscl ) on the campus of michigan state university .",
    "the fragmentation target of 1904  mg/@xmath13 thickness was located at the midacceptance target position of the a1900 fragment separator  @xcite .",
    "an achromatic aluminum wedge degrader of 600-mg/@xmath13 thickness and slit systems were used to purify the beam .",
    "the momentum acceptance of the separator was restricted to @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting cocktail beam of @xmath15 isotones contained ( 74% ) , ( 24.5% ) and ( 1.5% ) .",
    "targets of 188-mg/@xmath13 thick and 149.4-mg/@xmath13 thick ( vitreous carbon with a density of @xmath16  g/@xmath17 , 98.9% enriched in ) were placed at the reaction target position of the s800 spectrograph  @xcite to induce the one - neutron pickup onto the projectiles .",
    "the target position was surrounded by the high - resolution @xmath0-ray detection system sega , an array of 32-fold segmented high - purity germanium detectors  @xcite .",
    "the high degree of segmentation allows for event - by - event doppler reconstruction of the @xmath0 rays emitted by the projectile - like reaction residues in flight .",
    "the angle of the @xmath0-ray emission entering the doppler reconstruction is determined from the location of the segment that registered the largest energy deposition .",

    "fig  [ fig : momentum ] shows for both the be and the c targets the momentum distributions of the pickup product together with the momentum profile of the beam passing through the target essentially un - reacted .",
    "the width of the momentum profile as measured in the spectrograph s focal plane is dominated by the energy ( momentum ) straggling of the projectiles in the respective reaction target .",
    "the curves through the data points are to guide the eye and have been used in the case of the distributions to determine acceptance corrections on the low - momentum side of 9.9% and 5% for the cross sections measured with the be and c targets , respectively .",
    "the widths of the momentum distributions are strikingly different for the measurements with the two different targets while the momentum profiles of the un - reacted projectiles are essentially identical in both cases .",
    "the differential momentum loss @xmath29 of that takes into account that the pickup can , with equal probabilities , occur at any point along the trajectory through the target was found to be negligible @xmath30 unlike in the case of one - proton pickup  @xcite .",

    "the latter curve has been scaled to the measurements to aid comparison of the shapes but does not take into account small folding effects due to the finite emittance of the incident beam and from angular straggling in the target .",
    "the spectra show that the distributions fit well into the elliptical angular acceptance of the s800 spectrograph ( @xmath33 5@xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath33 3.5@xmath34 ) in agreement with the calculations.,width=302 ]    if the neutron pickup reaction is strictly _ two - body _ , i.e. it involves only transfers between bound states of the target and the projectile and also leaves a bound target - like residue , then the intrinsic , reaction - mechanism - induced parallel momentum distribution of the heavy projectile - like residues , @xmath36 , will be very narrow .",
    "the necessary formula is given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .",
    "so , unlike knockout reaction measurements , the residue momentum distribution does not provide spectroscopic ( orbital angular momentum ) information , however , it carries a reaction mechanism diagnostic , as follows .",
    "following strict two - body transfers , the intrinsic @xmath36 momentum distribution is essentially @xmath37-function like in comparison to the incident beam momentum resolution @xmath38 and the energy broadening due to passage through the target .",
    "thus , the extent to which the measured residue momentum distribution differs from that of the un - reacted @xmath39 mg beam provides direct evidence for events that go beyond a two - body reaction model description .",
    "we note that this direct comparison of the measured distributions from the carbon and beryllium targets with that of the un - reacted @xmath39 mg , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : momentum ] , leads to qualitatively different outcomes in the two cases .",

    "the @xmath21 one - neutron pickup reaction was performed at 84.2  mev per nucleon mid - target energy .",
    "the inclusive cross section was measured for several data runs and found to be constant within the statistical uncertainty . since for this target",
    "the longitudinal momentum distribution of the residues is much wider than for the carbon target - induced reaction [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : momentum ] ( bottom ) ] , the low - momentum tail of the distribution is cut more severely by the beam blocker . a 9.9% correction for the missing counts was applied to the cross section .",
    "the inclusive cross section , including the acceptance correction and with a 6% systematic uncertainty added , amounts to @xmath105  mb .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectra and population patterns for the carbon and beryllium - induced reactions are very similar .",
    "in fact , the partial cross sections are identical within uncertainties .",
    "again , the partial cross section for the @xmath23 ground state was obtained from subtracting the populations from all observed feeders , with the possible population of the @xmath28 state at 2.9  mev included in the uncertainty .",
    "in addition , due to possible unobserved feeding by higher energy @xmath0-ray transitions , the ground state cross section is expected to be an upper limit .",
    "the measured cross sections are summarized in table  [ tab : theo2 ] and discussed below .",
    "the results for the @xmath10be target allow us to draw some immediate conclusions .",
    "the cross sections in table [ tab : theo2 ] , calculated assuming pickup only of the valence neutron , are considerably smaller than those measured .",
    "this result , combined with the similarity of the measured values to those of the carbon target , and the ( non - two - body ) width of the measured @xmath6 mg momentum distribution for this target , see fig .",
    "[ fig : momentum ] , all point to the dominance of reaction events involving the pickup of strongly - bound neutrons from @xmath10be .",
    "we conclude that the momentum composition of the wave function of the weakly - bound neutron does not match effectively to the needs of the fast pickup mechanism .",
    "as was discussed earlier , the strength associated with the core neutrons is located at @xmath51be excitation energies high in the continuum , near to and in excess of 15 mev , and so can not be modelled quantitatively within the ccba framework .",
    "it is interesting to observe that empirically these four neutrons in the ( two @xmath60-particle ) @xmath51be core contribute approximately the same cross sections , state - by - state , as for the carbon target ( see table [ tab : theo1 ] ) .",
    "it can be deduced from table [ tab : theo1 ] that the fast pickup reaction is also selective in populating the states with higher orbital angular momentum transfer . in the present experiment our ability to probe this aspect of the reaction is limited since only @xmath106- and @xmath107wave neutron final states are resolved .",
    "the [ @xmath108 $ ] configurations are seen to dominate .",
    "however , we can begin to clarify this expected orbital angular momentum sensitivity using our theoretical ccba calculations for the carbon target . to make transparent this @xmath2-sensitivity , without the need to remove spectroscopic factors and @xmath109-value considerations , we calculated the pickup cross sections for assumed @xmath82 , @xmath110 , @xmath44 , and @xmath111 transfers , all with unit spectroscopic factor and with all states located at the position of the physical 0.451 mev state ; and so with separation energy 12.70 mev .",
    "the summed ( over final states ) single - particle cross sections obtained are @xmath112 , 0.58 , 3.51 , and 11.12 mb , respectively .",
    "these values represent real enhancements with @xmath2 , due to improved linear and angular momentum matching , above those due to the advantageous @xmath113 final states multiplicative factor .",
    "this is clear from the re - scaled values @xmath114 , 0.116 , 0.585 , and 1.39  mb , respectively .",
    "this suggests that there is the potential for this reaction mechanism to help locate emerging particle strength associated with high-@xmath2 intruder orbitals that enter the low - energy levels spectrum of rare nuclei .",
    "in summary , new measurements and reaction model calculations are presented for the fast one - neutron pickup reactions @xmath19 and @xmath21 at mid - target energies of about 84 mev per nucleon .",
    "measurements were made using both carbon and beryllium targets , having distinctly different neutron single - particle configurations .",
    "significant differences in the widths of the longitudinal momentum distributions for the two different targets were observed , pointing to the differences in the corresponding reaction mechanisms .",
    "these data thus provide evidence that the @xmath115 reactions proceed largely as a direct neutron transfer - producing target residues in bound states - while the corresponding pickup reactions induced by appear to leave the target - like residue highly excited and in the continuum .",
    "partial cross sections to final states are calculated ( inclusive with respect to the target residue final states ) based on the coupled channels born approximation and assuming shell - model configurations for the final states .",
    "these cross sections are in reasonable quantitative agreement with the measured excited state partial cross section values .",
    "clearly these pickup partial cross sections in themselves provide insufficient information to determine empirically both the dominant single - particle transferred angular momentum and their spectroscopic strengths - and must be used in conjunction with structure theory . based on our observed ( theoretical ) sensitivity of the fast pickup reactions to high - momentum components in the nuclear wave function and the @xmath2 of the transferred nucleon",
    ", we propose their possible application in helping to map the descent of high-@xmath2 neutron single - particle ( intruder ) states in regions of shell evolution where traditional neutron magic numbers break down .",
    "specifically , we envisage that the fast pickup mechanism could be used , together with theoretical predictions of level ordering and spectroscopic factors , to study the systematics of and test level migration predictions along isotopic chains - assessing shell - model and effective interaction predictions .",
    "this could provide complementary information to transfer reaction studies , where these overlap , and with the prospect of extending measurements into regions currently inaccessible ( by virtue of beam intensity ) to transfer .",
    "examples are the most neutron - rich ne , na and mg isotopes approaching @xmath116 where the neutron intruder @xmath104 orbital comes down in energy and dominates ground - state and low - lying configurations in the so - called `` island of inversion '' @xcite .",
