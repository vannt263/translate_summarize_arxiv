    "no other rare @xmath3 decays have been identified yet , but they are about at the door of discovery .",
    "one of these decays that involves a lepton pair in the final state @xmath5 is especially interesting .",
    "it is potentially a window to new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and has been studied extensively in literature . in particular , the spectra of invariant mass and forward - backward asymmetry of the lepton pair are shown very sensitive to different types of new physics @xcite .",
    "qcd corrections have been calculated and are under control , which enables one to predict reliably the decay rate and spectra @xcite .",
    "the calculation including qcd corrections is done by an effective hamiltonian approach , which we shall describe briefly in the next section .",
    "however , a complication arises from a long distance contribution of @xmath6 . to include this contribution the amplitudes of @xmath1",
    "resonances are added to the perturbative amplitude in a rather phenomenological way @xcite .",
    "each of the @xmath1 amplitudes has an overall normalization to be determined by experiments , an arbitrary phase relative to the perturbative amplitude , and the @xmath1 resonance shape is described by a breit - wigner prescription .",
    "all these give rise to uncertainties in the prediction of the spectra .",
    "another source of uncertainty to decay spectra comes from the fact that @xmath3 meson is a bound state of a @xmath2 quark and a light quark .",
    "the bound state effect can be represented by a fermi motion of the @xmath2 quark , which is of order of @xmath7 .",
    "we use the popular model of altarelli _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite to formulate the fermi motion .",
    "another important smearing effect comes from the resolution in the measurement of lepton momenta .",
    "the objective of this report is to investigate the effects of ( i ) the arbitrariness of the phase between the @xmath1 resonance amplitudes and the perturbative amplitude , ( ii ) fermi motion of the @xmath2 quark inside the @xmath3 meson , and ( iii ) the smearing of lepton momenta on the spectra of invariant mass and forward - backward asymmetry of the lepton pair .",
    "we show that the sensitivity is reduced , in particular , in the regions next to @xmath1 resonances",
    ". very often new physics can be parameterized by wilson coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "we shall investigate how much the @xmath8 are needed to change such that the spectra are distinguishable from the sm ones , under the effects of the above .",

    "second , the coefficients @xmath8 at the @xmath30-mass scale are evolved down to the bottom - mass scale using renormalization group equations .",
    "since the operators @xmath12 s are all mixed under renormalization , the renormalization group equations for @xmath25 s are a set of coupled equations : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the evolution matrix and @xmath33 is the vector consisting of @xmath34 s .",

    "( [ width ] ) and ( [ asy ] ) is lorentz - invariant , the spectrum in eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) is almost stable under lorentz boost .",
    "the slight change is due to the fact that different fermi - motion momentum @xmath67 will give different @xmath27 , which in turns affects the invariant mass spectrum . on the other hand",

    "the free quark model that treats the decay of a @xmath3 meson as a free @xmath2 quark is an idealistic model in the sense that it is only correct if @xmath27 is infinitely heavy .",
    "it has been proved by using heavy quark effective theory that the correction is of order @xmath68 ; in particular the lepton spectrum starts with @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "this behavior can also be understood in terms of fermi motion ( fm ) of the @xmath2 quark inside the @xmath3 meson , which causes a small offshellness of the @xmath2 quark .",

    "the @xmath2 quark is assumed to have a small momentum @xmath67 , which follows a gaussian distribution with the parameter @xmath70 : @xmath72 and a normalization @xmath73 .",
    "energy - momentum conservation requires the @xmath2 quark mass to be dependent on @xmath67 : @xmath74 as a consequence of this continuous range of @xmath27 , spectra will be smeared .",
    "however , the invariant mass spectrum of the lepton pair will be affected minimally because the invariant mass is a lorentz - invariant quantity and the lepton spectrum only receives corrections of order @xmath75 .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum with the effect of fm smearing is given by @xmath76 and a similar expression is valid for the lepton forward - backward asymmetry .",

    "this smearing effect is actually stronger than the fm smearing .",
    "note that both the angular and energy measurements will be affected by detector resolution .",
    "we shall employ the following resolutions , which are used in the cleo @xmath82 measurement @xcite , in our study : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are in gev . in our study , the @xmath2-quark momentum @xmath67 and its direction",
