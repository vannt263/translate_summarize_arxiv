    "the major advantage of looking at @xmath4 dilepton pair arises due to the mass of the @xmath2 ( @xmath5 1.77 gev ) .",
    "the @xmath2 pair mass distribution would then start beyond known contribution of hadronic resonances ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) which dominates in the respective mass regions in @xmath9 and @xmath10 sector .",
    "this would in turn mean the remaining contribution for @xmath2 production are due to thermal sources from partonic medium , pion annihilation in hadronic medium and drell yan mechanism .",
    "we think that the results will definitely provide some useful baseline for experimental search and further detailed studies .",
