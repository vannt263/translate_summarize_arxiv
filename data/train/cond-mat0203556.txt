    "since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) in 1995  @xcite , a wide variety of properties and effects in bec s has been studied . among the major topics of interest",
    "are topological defects such as vortices  @xcite and solitons  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the realization of bec s in optical traps  @xcite has opened up interesting new avenues of research in this area .",
    "this development makes it possible to create multicomponent condensates where all magnetic substates @xmath0 are trapped .",
    "the resulting spin degree of freedom permits the existence of topological defects that can not appear in scalar condensates , such as skyrmions  @xcite and monopoles  @xcite .",
    "important properties of monopoles , such as stability and dynamics , have already been examined  @xcite . here",
    "we propose an explicit method for creating a monopole in bec s , focusing on the experimentally relevant case of @xmath1 .",
    "our proposal extends the method of `` phase imprinting '' used to generate topological defects in scalar condensates  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the energy shift experienced by each component of the condensate depends on both @xmath0 and the polarization of the laser beam , and that by applying a sequence of different polarizations the phases of the components can be engineered in a broad manner .",
    "a spin-1 bec can be described by the condensate wavefunction @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total density and @xmath4 is a normalized spinor describing the local spin of the condensate . for an anti - ferromagnetic bec such as @xmath5 ,",
    "the ground state spinor is given by  @xcite [ eq : ground ] _",
    "g()= (    c 0 + 1 + 0    ) .    the spinor corresponding to a monopole has the form  @xcite [ eq : monopolespinor ] _ m ( ) = (    c -m_x()+im_y ( ) + m_z ( ) + m_x()+im_y ( )    ) .",
    "@xmath6 is a unit vector field that describes the local rotation of the ground state spinor . by considering the energy and winding number of such a condensate",
    ", it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath7 uniquely characterizes the monopole structure .",
    "we see that @xmath6 assumes the familiar hedgehog structure associated with a monopole .    for the purpose of phase engineering ,",
    "it is convenient to also write this spinor in spherical coordinates as [ eq : spherical ] _ m ( ) = (    c - e^-i +   + e^i +    ) , where @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle and @xmath9 the polar angle .",
    "in addition , we define the phase of each component @xmath10 . for example",

    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 describe respectively the applied magnetic field and the laser beams that will be used to create the monopole . during the times",
    "that the applied magnetic field and lasers are turned on , we assume that their respective hamiltonians dominate @xmath23 and are the only terms that need to be considered in the evolution of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian for the applied magnetic field is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "when we ignore all other terms in @xmath23 , the magnetic field leads to the following equations of motion : [ eq : b - motion ] = ( _ ij)_j .",
    "when a laser beam is applied , the ground state energy of magnetic substate @xmath14 is shifted by an amount  @xcite [ eq : lightshift ] e_i = i_j , where the sum is carried out over all excited states @xmath26 . here , @xmath27 is the detuning of the laser from the @xmath28 transition , @xmath29 the laser intensity , @xmath30 the rate of spontaneous decay , @xmath31 the atomic resonance frequency , and @xmath32 is a transition strength characterizing the coupling between atom and laser .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 depend on the ground substate @xmath0 and on the polarization of the laser beam and are given in figure  [ fig : transitionstrengths ] .",
    "the concept of phase engineering via imprinting was suggested  @xcite and experimentally demonstrated  @xcite as a means of creating topological defects in scalar condensates .",
    "we extend the method to spinor condensates , focusing on the case of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that the energy shifts induced by different beam polarizations allow for wide capabilities in phase engineering .",
    "suppose that a laser is detuned by an amount @xmath33 from the @xmath34 transition , and that the states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are separated in frequency by an amount @xmath37 , as shown in figure  [ fig : frequencydiagram ] . from eq .",

    "equations  ( [ eq : pi - phaseshift])-([eq : minus - phaseshift ] ) suggest a basic technique for phase engineering of the spinor condensate . to shift the phase of @xmath48 relative to @xmath49 , one can use beams with polarizations @xmath50 and @xmath51 . once the phase between these two states is fixed as desired , one can use @xmath43-polarized light to adjust the phase of @xmath52 relative to the other states . although it is not used in our proposal for monopole creation , we note that this phase shift is due to a second order term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - phaseshift ] ) , and we thus expect that it will be more difficult to implement in an experiment",
    ". it may be useful , in addition , to alter the global phase of the condensate , which can be realized approximately by using the first order term in eq .",

    "( [ eq : pi - phaseshift])-([eq : minus - phaseshift ] ) remain valid with the replacements @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "martikainen et al .  point out  @xcite that the monopole spinor given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : monopolespinor ] ) resembles a combination of other topological defects .",
    "indeed , the form of @xmath59 presented in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spherical ] ) makes it clear that the @xmath60 state contains a vortex , the @xmath49 state an anti - vortex , and the @xmath52 state a soliton .",
    "they thus suggest that one can experimentally create monopoles by creating the appropriate defects in the individual components . here",
    "we provide a method to accomplish this using the phase imprinting concepts discussed above .",
    "starting from the ground state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) , we first apply a constant magnetic field of magnitude @xmath61 along the negative @xmath62-axis for a time @xmath63 . defining @xmath64 , eq .",

    ". the phases of @xmath65 ( for @xmath66 ) are _",
    "b^t=(00 ) .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field is to populate the @xmath67 states prior to phase engineering .",
    "experimentally , @xmath68 should be chosen to best realize the monopole structure .    to create the monopole",
    ", we assume that we have blue - detuned lasers , all of which have equal intensities @xmath55 and values of @xmath33 , and which can be applied in square - shaped pulses .",
    "the results can be accordingly modified to cover more general situations .",
    "in addition , we assume that we have absorption plates that can create the following intensity profiles : @xmath69 the pulse sequence to create the monopole is given in table  [ table : pulsesequence ] .",
    "pulses a and b use intensity profiles with azimuthal dependence to create a vortex in the @xmath48 component and an anti - vortex in the @xmath49 component",
    ". pulses c and d together imprint the necessary phases to generate the soliton in the @xmath52 component .",
    "it can be readily verified that the resulting phases of the components are exactly those of the monopole given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : monopolephase ] ) .",
    "the total time of the laser pulses , assuming that pulses with profiles @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be executed simultaneously , is @xmath72 .",
    "strictly speaking , pulse c is not physically possible  the profile @xmath70 requires an axis of propagation @xmath73 in the @xmath74 plane , which is inconsistent with a polarization vector of @xmath75 .",
    "however , it is possible to create an effective interaction term resembling @xmath76 using a beam that does propagate in the @xmath74 plane .",
    "indeed , consider a pulse with polarization vector @xmath77 sandwiched between magnetic field pulses that generate the rotations @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "one can readily check that ( -if_y ) ^ ( if_y)=. physically , the @xmath0 eigenstates along the @xmath80-axis are transformed by rotation to become @xmath0 eigenstates along the @xmath81-axis .",
    "the phase shifts are subsequently performed on these states , where @xmath70 and @xmath82 are consistent , before the system is rotated back .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     experimentally , one should seek to make @xmath33 as large as possible while increasing @xmath55 to maintain a given potential depth .",
    "this is because the photon scattering rate @xmath83 of an individual atom scales as @xmath84 compared to @xmath85 for the dipole potential  @xcite , and also because the approximation errors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pi - phaseshift])-([eq : minus - phaseshift ] ) scale as @xmath86 . to maintain the validity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pi - phaseshift])-([eq : minus - phaseshift ] ) , however , one must impose the limit @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the fine structure splitting between @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "physically , this means that the light shifts due to the excited @xmath90 states remain negligible compared to those originating from the @xmath89 states . as a concrete example , we consider the case @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the saturation intensity .",
    "this results in a pulse sequence length of @xmath94 and a scattering time of an individual atom of @xmath95 .",
    "we also mention that the ratio @xmath96 can be enhanced by pairing every beam in the original sequence with an appropriately chosen second beam .",
    "if both beams have the same polarization and are detuned equally above and below the @xmath97 transition , the light shifts from the @xmath90 states are approximately cancelled out , while those from the @xmath89 states are reinforced .",
    "this makes it possible to abandon the requirement @xmath87 and choose much larger detunings .",
    "finally , we note that the solution ( [ eq : phaseshift ] ) for the dynamics of the system under the laser beams is only approximate and overlooks subtler but important points .",
    "clearly such a transformation is unphysical in our case at the origin as it would introduce an infinite phase gradient energy  @xcite , and a more careful analysis of the dynamics near the center would have to include other terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "also , in a real system , an absorption plate can not perfectly generate the intensity profiles given in  ( [ eq:+azimuthalintensity ] ) and  ( [ eq :- azimuthalintensity ] ) , which leads to various degrees of imperfection in vortex creation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , experimental efforts to create a soliton in a scalar condensate using an intensity profile like that of  ( [ eq : stepintensity ] ) show that the dipole potential also creates a density wave in addition to the soliton  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the cited references for further discussion .",
    "ultimately , however , it does not appear that these imperfections preclude the creation of vortices and solitons , which suggests that the creation of monopoles via phase imprinting should also be viable in spite of such imperfections .",
    "we have proposed a method to create a monopole in an antiferromagnetic spin-1 bec by extending the phase imprinting concept used in scalar bec s .",
    "we demonstrate that laser beams with different polarizations generate energy shifts that can be used to engineer the phases of the magnetic substates in a broad manner .",
    "we also present an explicit pulse sequence that , starting from the ground state of the condensate , produces phases in the substates corresponding to those of a monopole ."
