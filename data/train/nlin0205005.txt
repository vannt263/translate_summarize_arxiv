    "several areas of science use model equations of the reaction - diffusion type .",
    "moreover , besides its special interest in some fields ( chemistry  @xcite , biology  @xcite , ... ) reaction - diffusion equations are considered as abstract models for pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "real systems are frequently composed of discrete elements , material models and biological cells are just two examples .",
    "therefore , it is natural to deal with the discrete space version of the reaction - diffusion equation . in this point",
    ", it must be emphasized that discreteness may manifest itself in a strong way , such that some phenomena are not simple analogies of the continuous ones .    here ,",
    "we focus on a discrete reaction - diffusion model such that its local dynamics ( reaction term ) is bistable , with two stable fixed points .",
    "particularly important examples of bistable dynamics are found in optics  @xcite , chemical systems  @xcite , and biology  @xcite .",
    "the main interest of these systems lies in the behaviour of the fronts that constitute the boundaries of the domains of both ( stable ) states .",
    "intuitively , the front will move from the most to the less stable state , enlarging a domain and shrinking the other .",
    "in fact , great attention has been devoted to the phenomenon of ` propagation failure ' or ` pinning '  @xcite , because it is usual that in discrete systems some threshold must be surpassed to achieve propagation .",
    "but , although one could expect that propagation does not succeed in the case of symmetric bistability , it was demonstrated that such possibility exists .",
    "hagberg and meron  @xcite studied a continuous bistable reaction - diffusion system , the fitzhugh - nagumo model , showing that , in the symmetric case , propagation occurred after a symmetry breaking front bifurcation . in this scenario , the front breaks its symmetry through a pitchfork bifurcation , at the same time that propagation is initiated .",
    "also , an analogous bifurcation was found for the complex ginzburg - landau equation  @xcite with the name of nonequilibrium ising - bloch bifurcation .    in a recent work ,",
    "we have reported  @xcite the existence of front propagation in a discrete symmetric bistable medium .",
    "the transition is exclusive for a discrete system and it is possible thanks to the multi - variable nature of the local dynamics .",
    "one variable systems are not able to break symmetry  @xcite even if the function that describes the local dynamics is not continuous  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the mechanism leading to propagation is not a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "contrastingly , it consists on a hopf bifurcation followed by a global bifurcation , that is equivalent to a gluing bifurcation of cycles . in correspondence ,",
    "the velocity of the front shows a logarithmic dependence close to the onset .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is two - fold . on one hand ,",
    "a more detailed analysis of the transition is undertaken , explaining which is the role of the stationary states of the system .",
    "on the other hand , the new features of the transition when a saddle - focus fixed point mediates the gluing bifurcation are investigated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ system ] presents the model . in sec .",
    "3 an overview of the transition is presented . in sec .",
    "4 a reduced cylindrical coordinate system is defined , and the mechanism of gluing of cycles underlying the transition between oscillating and travelling fronts is explained . in sec .  5 ,",
    "several non - trivial front dynamics are shown , including the chaotic motion of the front .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "6 is devoted to further considerations , while in sec .",
    "7 we present the conclusions .",
    "we consider a discrete reaction - diffusion equation in one dimension : @xmath1 where @xmath2 accounts for the coupling strength between neighbours , and the coupling matrix @xmath3 says which variables get coupled . in what concerns the local bistable dynamics , we deal with the well - known lorenz oscillator  @xcite as unit cell .",
    "it exhibits several characteristic behaviours depending on its internal parameters  @xcite : monostability , bistability , limit cycle , ` butterfly chaos ' , ` noisy periodicity ' , etc .",
    "we consider the range where the system contains two stable symmetry related fixed points ( bistability ) .",
    "the coupling matrix @xmath3 is taken with all elements zero except one : @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the equations describing the temporal evolution of the array are :    @xmath5    the standard values are chosen for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath9 . then , the lorenz system contains two stable foci",
    "@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 for @xmath14 in the range @xmath15 ; at @xmath16 , @xmath17 become unstable through a subcritical hopf bifurcation .",
    "also , it is important to note that there exists a saddle fixed point located at the origin for @xmath18 .    a fourth - order runge - kutta method , with time step 0.01 , was used to integrate eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) .",
    "a step - like initial condition is imposed to the system .",
    "results on front propagation do not depend on the boundary conditions provided that the array is large enough .",
    "thus , if one wishes the system evolve for long time in the regime of travelling front , one should move the boundary whilst the front propagates .",
    "also , one may imposed to the system periodic boundary conditions , with _ two _ fronts diametrically opposed as initial conditions .",
    "if the initial condition satisfies @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , both fronts propagate always in the same direction , avoiding its mutual annihilation .",
    "three main front dynamics are found when varying the parameter @xmath14 ( @xmath22 ) , and the coupling strength @xmath2 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we distinguish among standing ( static ) , oscillating and travelling fronts . in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , a centered step - like initial condition is imposed to the system with free ends and @xmath24 ; two different non - static regimes are achieved depending on the value of the coupling strength @xmath2 .",
    "note that the lorenz model is symmetric and the coupling that appears in eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) destroys this local symmetry but preserves the global reflection ( or @xmath25 ) symmetry :    @xmath26    therefore , for @xmath27 large enough , both senses of propagation are equally likely .",
    "a diagram of the different regions on the @xmath28 plane is shown in fig .  [ diagrama ] .",
    "it may be seen that static fronts are found for @xmath2 and/or @xmath14 small , whereas travelling fronts appear for large @xmath2 and @xmath14 .",
    "also , it is significative that oscillating fronts always exist between the standing and the travelling fronts regions . the line ( @xmath29 ) , that defines the boundary between the standing and the oscillating regions , approach @xmath30 as @xmath31 , since the nature of the fixed points ( @xmath17 ) deeply influences the dynamics of the front .",
    "this is not very surprising , but indicates that oscillating fronts will be usually found in bistable systems with stable foci , rather than nodes .",
    "somehow , the stability properties of the fixed points are transmitted to the front .",
    "also , it is significative that @xmath32 ( the threshold for travelling fronts ) seems to diverge asymptotically at @xmath33 .    instead of visualizing the system as in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , we show now which is the behaviour of the different units when the coupling is increased from zero .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath30 the step - like solution that we were considering consists of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "as the coupling increases this solution can be smoothly continued . but",
    "there exist two constrains for the stationary solutions , that come from eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) : @xmath39 therefore , all the units lie on a parabola that passes through @xmath17 and zero .",
    "however , when @xmath29 is reached the front undergoes a hopf bifurcation , and all the units start to oscillate leaving the mentioned parabola .",
    "the projection of the parabola onto the plane @xmath40 is a straight line , the bisectrix of the first and third quadrants .",
    "however , to better visualize oscillations out of the parabola , in fig .",
    "[ multiple ] we performed a @xmath41 rotation of the reference system .",
    "obviously those units closer to the front oscillate with larger amplitude that those located far from the front that are almost insensitive to the bifurcation .",
    "when @xmath32 is reached a multiple collision occurs ; the orbits of neighbouring units collide creating two  channels \" going from @xmath17 to @xmath42 .",
    "like in the symmetric fitzhugh - nagumo model studied by hagberg and meron  @xcite , the travelling front is not symmetric .",
    "however , in our case the mechanism leading to propagation is not a pitchfork bifurcation , instead , a hopf bifurcation that creates the oscillating front is the precursor of the travelling front .",
    "the description provided by fig .",
    "[ multiple ] is illustrative , but it is incomplete if one does not realize that besides the static solution that loses its stability through a hopf bifurcation , there must exist another ( unstable ) stationary state that mediates the multiple collision of cycles .",
    "therefore , one must search the stationary solutions monotonic in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "it is not difficult to find out that only two monotonic solutions , called stable and unstable dislocations , exist ( discarding spatial translations ) .",
    "they are the continuation of the solutions in the uncoupled limit : @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ". we shall refer to them as @xmath47- and @xmath48-state , respectively , and fig .",
    "[ 2s ] shows a sketch of them .",
    "it is the @xmath48-state which mediates the transition at @xmath32 , and it will be shown below that the stability properties of this solution will determine important features of the onset of the wavefronts .",
    "in this section we demonstrate how the transitions presented in the previous section may be described in the context of a gluing bifurcation , in which two limit cycles become a two - lobed cycle by involving an intermediate saddle point .",
    "the gluing bifurcations is usual in systems with @xmath25 symmetry  @xcite , because provided the existence of the symmetry it becomes a codimension - one bifurcation .",
    "figure [ multiple ] shows some kind of collective motion when the front oscillates .",
    "then , the whole set of variables @xmath49 is discarded , and instead , we chose to build a reduced phase space to study the dynamics . notice that if the medium is infinite , there exists a perfect symmetry under translation along the array . with this in mind ,",
    "we define two auxiliary variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 , that have sense for large enough @xmath27 and when the front is far enough from the boundaries :    @xmath52    variable @xmath50 accounts for the propagation of the front and is not bounded by default , then it must be defined within the range @xmath53/\\sqrt{2 } =   2 \\sqrt{2 b ( r-1)}$ ] , that is the magnitude that @xmath50 increases or decreases when the front moves one position along the array . on the other hand , @xmath51 is defined so that it is bounded under front propagation , notice that it is defined from eq .",
    "( [ fijos ] ) .",
    "if the medium consists of a number @xmath27 even of units , the static solutions are located in this cyclic phase space in :    @xmath54    if @xmath27 is odd both solutions exchange their coordinates . in what follows ,",
    "we only take @xmath27 even , unless it is specified .    the transition shown in fig .",
    "[ multiple ] is now shown in the cylindrical phase space in fig .",
    "[ pendulo ] .",
    "notice that when the front is static , we have an equilibrium point at @xmath55 ( @xmath47-state ) .",
    "when the front oscillates a limit cycle exists , and finally when the coupling goes beyond @xmath32 we find two symmetry related limit cycles , that turn around the cylindrical phase space in opposite directions .",
    "the situation is quite similar to a pendulum where libration corresponds now to oscillation , and rotation of the pendulum corresponds to propagation .",
    "thus , at @xmath56 there exist two homoclinic loops that connect the @xmath48-state with itself ( called separatrices for the pendulum ) .",
    "this bifurcation is called gluing bifurcation because it involves the collision of two cycles to create another ; although in our case it could be more appropriate to talk of a inverse gluing or a splitting bifurcation .    nonetheless , it is better to visualize our gluing bifurcation in @xmath57 .",
    "a possible transformation consists , topologically , in what follows : first of all , cut the cylinder with two planes perpendicular to its axis in such a way that the saddle point and the heteroclinic orbits stand between both planes .",
    "then compress both circumferences that limit the  cylinder \" inbetween to a point .",
    "thus , we have got an object topologically equal to a sphere .",
    "these two steps could be substituted by making the section of the cylinder equal to zero at @xmath58 and then making a transformation that makes our object finite .",
    "the last step is to make a hole at @xmath55 and deform what remains into a plane .    in fig .",
    "[ gluing ] the sketch of a gluing bifurcation equivalent to the one shown in the cylindrical phase space ( fig .",
    "[ pendulo ] ) is depicted .",
    "notice that for @xmath59 there exist an orbit that approaches twice per period close to the saddle point ( the @xmath48-solution ) , whereas for @xmath60 two symmetry related cycles , corresponding to both senses of propagation , coexist .",
    "the collision ( and subsequent destruction ) of a periodic orbit with a saddle , called saddle - loop bifurcation , is characterized by a logarithmic lengthening of the period of the cycle  @xcite .",
    "for the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ gluing ] , we expect to find the following dependencies for the periods ( @xmath62 ) in a neighbourhood of @xmath32 :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the unstable eigenvalue of the saddle fixed point .",
    "taking into account that one turn around the cylinder is equivalent to the movement of the front in one cell , it is clear that @xmath65 is the inverse of the velocity of the front ( @xmath66 ) . in the equation for the period @xmath67",
    "a factor 2 appears because the orbit approaches twice per cycle to the neighbourhood of the saddle point .",
    "moreover , it is expected that the ` fast dynamics ' ( the motion far from the saddle ) contained in variables @xmath68 will be approximately the same at both sides of the transition , and then , @xmath69 . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that at @xmath24 , the behaviour of @xmath70 and @xmath71 agrees with the predictions given by eqs .",
    "( [ t1],[t2 ] ) , and we show it here for @xmath72 in fig .  [ r16 ] .",
    "notice that the velocity of the front grows quite abruptly from zero at @xmath56 .",
    "the derivative of @xmath73 , near @xmath32 is , according to eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) :    @xmath74      in order to verify , not only qualitatively , but quantitatively the tendency of @xmath67 and @xmath66 when @xmath75 we computed numerically the value of the eigenvalues of the @xmath48-state at @xmath56 for finite @xmath27 . to preserve the symmetry , when computing the eigenvalues , the number of units @xmath27 was chosen to be odd , with the central unit located at the origin .",
    "the jacobian matrix ( @xmath76 ) for a discrete reaction - diffusion model ( see eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) ) exhibits the following tridiagonal structure :    @xmath77    which , according to eq .",
    "( [ lorenz ] ) has got the components : @xmath78 recall that @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , @xmath80 is always an eigenvalue with trivial eigenvector @xmath81 . using the program matlab we obtained the eigenvalues for an array of @xmath82 units , that we expect to be large enough to inform us about the properties of a front in an infinite medium , as long as the front is a very localized structure .",
    "figure  [ eigs ] shows the results for three values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath2 .",
    "[ eigs ]  ( a ) shows the eigenvalues ( @xmath83 ) for @xmath30 and @xmath24 , which illustrates the meaning of the different eigenvalues .",
    "there are three simple eigenvalues corresponding to the oscillator located in the center of the array whose coordinates are @xmath84 , recall that we are considering a @xmath48-state .",
    "moreover , there are three ( @xmath85)-degenerated eigenvalues , corresponding to the oscillators with coordinates @xmath86 .",
    "eigenvalues are depicted with circles of different sizes to better observe degeneracy .",
    "when @xmath2 grows above zero degeneracy is lost . in fig .",
    "[ eigs ]  ( b ) , we graph the eigenvalues for @xmath87 ( only those eigenvalues with @xmath88 are shown ) .",
    "the unstable eigenvalue corresponds to the fixed point at the origin of a lorenz oscillator .",
    "there is also a slightly negative eigenvalue ( @xmath89 ) that is the leading eigenvalue among the whole spectrum of negative eigenvalues .",
    "a different scenario is found for @xmath72 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ eigs ]  ( c ) . in this case , it is not so clear which stable eigenvalue must be considered as the leading one in the gluing process .",
    "there are several eigenvalues making up two lines at both sides of the real axis in the complex plain , but these are not relevant , as long as they are the eigenvalues associated with the stability properties of each domain at both sides of the front where quasi - homogeneous domains around @xmath17 exist . as well , if the eigenvalue located at @xmath80 is considered , its eigenvector becomes trivial and it can not be expected to participate in the gluing bifurcation .",
    "then , the solitary eigenvalue denoted by @xmath90 is the one ( with its complex conjugate @xmath91 ) that defines the leading ( two - dimensional ) stable manifold .",
    "in fact , by increasing continuously @xmath14 along @xmath32 , the eigenvalue @xmath89 could be followed directly from that obtained for @xmath24 ( see figs .  [ eigs ]  ( b , c ) ) . according to the statements exposed above",
    ", the graph of @xmath51 vs. @xmath50 , for @xmath2 close to @xmath32 and @xmath72 , shows some spiraling to work in a hyper - cylindrical phase space .",

    "figure  [ spi ] shows this effect that confirms that now the gluing is mediated by a saddle - focus .",
    "the cyclic definition of @xmath50 has been relaxed in order to get a better observation of the spiral trajectory near the @xmath48-state .",
    "nonetheless , if one looks at the asymptotic properties of the oscillation period of the front and its velocity , no difference with the case of the planar connection is found .",
    "so , fig .",
    "[ r16 ] already confirmed the eqs .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , and the slopes agree with the numerical value : @xmath93 .    a sketch of the gluing bifurcation in the saddle - focus case is shown in fig .",
    "[ gluingsf ] .",
    "homoclinic orbits , at @xmath56 are denoted by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the process of gluing is drawn in analogy to fig .",
    "[ gluing ] .",
    "although , from both figures , one could think that the complex and the real cases are almost equivalent , there exist very fundamental differences between both cases .",
    "thus , the transition from oscillating to travelling fronts may become quite convoluted in the complex case .",
    "this is observed for larger values of @xmath14 and is the subject of the next section .",
    "in figure [ sindex ] the value of the complex part of the stable leading eigenvalues ( @xmath96 ) , along the line @xmath56 , is shown as a function of @xmath14 with a dashed line .",
    "it is found that above @xmath97 the stable leading eigenvalues are complex conjugates , and therefore , the gluing bifurcation occurs mediated by a saddle - focus point .",
    "many works have been devoted to the problem of saddle - loop bifurcations involving a saddle - focus fixed point ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a deep presentation of this problem is out of the scope of this paper , so we just introduce some of the most relevant results .    for the case of",
    "a _ single _ homoclinic orbit , occurring at a critical value of the control parameter ( e.g. @xmath98 ) , it was found by shilnikov  @xcite that when the ratio @xmath99 called _ saddle index _ , is less than one , there are a countable infinity of periodic orbits in a neighbourhood of the homoclinic orbit , all of which are saddles .",
    "these saddle orbits are created in a sequence of tangent bifurcations at both sides of @xmath98 , such that the stable branches ( provided @xmath100 ) become unstable through period - doubling bifurcations .",
    "this scenario , where infinite orbits , with periods ranging from some finite value to an infinite one , arrange in a wiggly curve around the critical value , is known as _",
    "shilnikov wiggle_. and it is , with the lorenz and the bifocal mechanisms , one of the universal routes to chaos through homoclinicity  @xcite .    however , the results by shilnikov apply in a very small neighbourhood of the critical parameter .",
    "therefore , the relationship between the local ( theoretical ) results and the global ( observed ) behaviours can not be stated oversimply .",
    "it was shown by glendinning and sparrow  @xcite that the difference between the @xmath101 and the @xmath102 approaches to homoclinicity may not be easily observed numerically and may not be relevant from a global point of view .",
    "in fact , for the lowest branch ( the orbit with the lowest period ) that already exist far from the critical parameter , deviations from the behaviour predicted by the local analysis are most likely to occur .",
    "one may realize the complexity of the problem if one notices that , besides the shilnikov wiggle , there exist subsidiary homoclinic connections . following the nomenclature of ref .",
    "@xcite , subsidiary homoclinic orbits are multiple - pulse homoclinic orbits , i.e. orbits that pass several times near the stationary point without achieving homoclinicity .    in case",
    "the homoclinic connection is _",
    "double _ ( two loops ) , as occurs in the gluing bifurcation , some differences are appreciated with the case described above .",
    "the most important point is that , although for @xmath102 no smale horseshoe exist as in the single case , the approach of orbits to @xmath103 ( fig .",
    "[ gluingsf ] ) is chaotic  @xcite",
    ".    figure [ sindex ] shows the value of @xmath104 ( solid line ) as a function of @xmath14 along the line @xmath56 .",
    "it is found that at @xmath105 , @xmath104 crosses one .",
    "interested in the complex behaviours that our system could show , we focused in two values of @xmath14 above and below @xmath106 : @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "we do not want to carry out a detailed analysis of the solutions found , but just to show that the results have got the  flavour \" expected according to previous theoretical studies on bi - homoclinicity to a saddle - focus  @xcite .      in the following , we analyse the transition from a oscillating front to a travelling front for @xmath107 .",

    "unfortunately , we have not been able to find oscillations with semi - periods larger than 3.2 t.u .",
    "this occurs because as the period grows , and therefore ( bi-)homoclinicity is reached , the chaotic transients become larger and larger .",

    "so , as @xmath128 , @xmath64 and @xmath89 of the @xmath48-state at @xmath32 should meet the pair of complex conjugates eigenvalues that characterize the hopf bifurcation of the @xmath47-state at @xmath29 . in short , both lines meet at @xmath129 in a double - zero eigenvalue ( takens - bogdanov ) point .",
    "for this reason , oscillations above @xmath29 have a small frequency and @xmath130 when @xmath131 ( see fig .  [ sindex ] ) .",
    "our system of coupled lorenz oscillators is nothing but a mathematical model , because it is clear that it is impossible to build an experimental set - up _ infinitely large _ with _ identical _ units all of them being _",
    "exactly symmetric_. this means that in a real system no invariance under translation and under reflection exists .",
    "boundary effects can be significatively minimized by using an array sufficiently large , recall that the front is very localized , and only for large @xmath2 a significative amount of oscillators are located in the steepest part of the front .",
    "the effect of using non - identical units is difficult to be predicted but could manifest in a neighbourhood of @xmath32 by letting some localized oscillation to exist or making the front to reverse back at a given time . nonetheless , there are lots of ways to make the oscillators non - identical and then giving rise to an enormous variety of effects .",
    "more tractable is the case where all the oscillators are identical , but asymmetric . in this situation",
    ", we should use the theory of imperfect gluing bifurcations .",
    "larger is the asymmetry , larger is the interval of @xmath2 at @xmath132 where new periodic orbits appear .",
    "mainly , the case when the saddle value @xmath133 is negative has been considered  @xcite showing that no more than two periodic orbits can coexist in the same parameter domain , and providing some simple rules for the symbolic sequences of 0 s and 1 s of the cycles , based on a farey tree structure .",
    "experimental studies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the latter also considers the case with @xmath134 ( i.e. saddle - focus with @xmath135 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the system when the line @xmath137 is crossed , and @xmath86 become unstable , is similar to that described for the off - diagonal coupling in  @xcite .",
    "the transition , between oscillating and travelling fronts , becomes a transition between two well - differentiated types of spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "the slightly unstable nature of @xmath86 makes possible that domains with oscillators close to @xmath86 exist , however , sometimes one oscillator is able to jump to the other lobe , which , in the propagating region , produces the creation of two counterpropagating fronts . in short , for @xmath60 , we observe spatio - temporal chaos characterized by the spontaneous creation of counterpropagating fronts and front reversals .",
    "one may ask if the symmetry front bifurcation presented here is universal or not ; in other words , in which kind of system could one expect to find this transition ?",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that other coupling matrices were able to induce front propagation in an array of coupled lorenz oscillators .",
    "if one considers coupling matrices with all elements zero except one , these two off - diagonal couplings : @xmath138 exhibit front propagation by a similar route to the one explained here",
    ". however , it may happen that the transition occurs in such a way that the standing front loses its symmetry in a small interval .",
    "this happens because a pitchfork bifurcation renders the @xmath47-state unstable , and when the coupling in increased further , the new ( static nonsymmetric ) solutions  collide \" with the @xmath48-state transferring the stability ( through a pitchfork bifurcation again ) .",
    "later , it is the @xmath48-state which undergoes a hopf bifurcation , and finally , the oscillating solution touch the @xmath47-state creating the travelling solutions .",
    "the logarithmic laws , eqs .",
    "( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2 ] ) , are also obtained  @xcite .",
    "we have also checked our results with other two bistable systems : an array whose local dynamics is a truncation of the magnetohydrodynamic partial differential equations of a disc dynamo  @xcite , and the fitzhugh - nagumo model  @xcite .",
    "the dynamo model is similar to the lorenz system and in some parameter range it exhibits symmetric bistability .",
    "the equations of the model are : @xmath139 the system has one unstable fixed point at @xmath140 and two stable fixed points @xmath141 in the range @xmath142 , with @xmath143 for @xmath144 , @xmath145 .",
    "we have found a transition like that with lorenz systems , for instance for the coupling matrix @xmath4 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath146 the transition is smooth or chaotic . whereas for @xmath147 we find a fine logarithmic profile of the front velocity , for @xmath148 the front velocity function",
    "is interrupted by a chaotic regime , like that shown in fig .",
    "[ chaos ] , when approaching the threshold .",
    "also the oscillating dynamics , for @xmath146 close to @xmath149 is not so simple like that shown in fig .",
    "[ multiple ] .    for the discrete fitzhugh - nagumo model : @xmath150 we take @xmath151 and @xmath152 which provide the @xmath25 symmetry and bistability , respectively .",
    "the local dynamics presents a saddle equilibrium point at the origin , and two odd symmetric stable fixed points @xmath153 .",
    "as occurs in the continuous version  @xcite , propagation only succeeds for small @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) . for very small",
    "@xmath2 , only one stable solution exits , the standing one ( @xmath47-state ) .",
    "when @xmath2 increases , two ( counterpropagating ) travelling solutions coexist with the standing one .",
    "finally , the standing solution undergoes a _",
    "hopf bifurcation and the travelling solutions become the only stable ones .",
    "this route is apparently very different from those shown above , since a computation of the eigenvalues corresponding to the @xmath48-state reveals that @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) , and therefore , if any gluing bifurcation exists , it involves unstable cycles .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the transition is as follows : when @xmath2 reaches a critical value @xmath158 , two stable travelling solutions ( both propagation senses ) are born with nonzero velocity ( @xmath159 ) , in two simultaneous saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the unstable travelling solutions that appear in these saddle - node bifurcations become glued , when @xmath2 is slightly increased , at @xmath160 . in this way ,",
    "the ( unstable ) oscillating solution , that coalesces with the @xmath47-state at the ( subcritical ) hopf bifurcation , is created .    in fig .",
    "[ fhnvel ] , we present the values of @xmath161 as a function of @xmath2 , for @xmath162",
    ". one may observe that within a range of values of @xmath2of @xmath2 , @xmath161 exhibits a logarithmic profile ( fig .",
    "[ fhnvel ]  ( b ) ) but finally departs from that tendency , and shows a root - square dependence , typical of a saddle - node bifurcation ( fig .",
    "[ fhnvel ]  ( c ) ) : @xmath163 in our case , the + ( resp .",
    "- ) sign corresponds to the unstable ( resp .",
    "stable ) solution .",
    "@xmath158 is close to @xmath164 and that is the reason why the partial logarithmic dependence can be recognized in fig .",
    "[ fhnvel ]  ( b ) .",
    "in fact the saddle index is not very small , @xmath165 , what makes possible the unstable cycles to disappear at @xmath158 close to @xmath164 .",
    "it has been shown that an array composed of symmetric bistable units undergoes a front bifurcation originating two counterpropagating travelling solutions .",
    "the mechanism consists in a hopf bifurcation of the static front , followed by a global bifurcation equivalent to a gluing bifurcation of cycles onto a cylindrical phase space .",
    "accordingly , close to the threshold , the period of oscillation of the front ( @xmath67 ) and the speed of the front ( @xmath66 ) follow logarithmic laws .",
    "an unstable static solution mediates the gluing process , in such a way that the value of its unstable eigenvalue determines the rate of divergence of @xmath67 and @xmath71 .",
    "the transition is typically discrete , and the question of the continuum limit is intriguing .",
    "also , it has been demonstrated that the gluing transition may be mediated by a saddle - focus point . in that case ,",
    "when the saddle index ( @xmath104 ) approaches one , the transition becomes much more convoluted .",
    "different oscillating and travelling regimes are observed , included chaotic motion of the front due to shilnikov chaos .    in sec .",
    "[ universality ] we have dealt with other couplings and other bistable systems .",
    "we have found common features with the transition described here in detail for the lorenz oscillator , coupled through the @xmath166 variable . even in the case of the discrete fitzhugh - nagumo model ,",
    "where the transition is apparently very different , a careful examination indicates that a similar scenario exists , despite the gluing bifurcation is  invisible \" .",
    "a further investigation is needed to know _ a priori _ what local dynamics and what couplings are suitable to achieve propagation in a discrete symmetric bistable medium . besides the multi - variable nature of the local dynamics , some trivial considerations about the coupling , and the observation that foci are more adequate than sinks , additional arguments are still to be developed .",
