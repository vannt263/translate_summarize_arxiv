    "predictions of neutrino cross - sections at high energies have sizeable uncertainties which derive from the uncertainties on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the nucleon . in the framework of the quark - parton model , high energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) accesses large values of @xmath1 , the invariant mass of the exchanged vector boson , and small values of bjorken @xmath2 , the fraction of the momentum of the incoming nucleon taken by the struck quark .",
    "thus in evaluating uncertainties on high energy neutrino dis cross - sections it is important to use the most up - to - date information from the experiments at hera , which have accessed the lowest @xmath2 and highest @xmath1 scales to date .",
    "h1 and zeus have now combined the data collected in the years 19942000 to give very accurate inclusive cross - sections in the range @xmath3 and @xmath4 gev@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we consider modern pdf sets which include these data in order to provide the best benchmark cross - section for experiments searching for high energy cosmic neutrinos such as anita @xcite , icecube @xcite , the pierre auger observatory @xcite and rice @xcite , as well as forthcoming experiments such as ara @xcite , arianna @xcite , jem - euso @xcite and lunaska @xcite .",
    "conventional pdf fits use the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) dglap formalism  @xcite of qcd to make predictions for dis cross - sections of leptons on hadrons . at low @xmath2 it may be necessary to go beyond the dglap formalism in order to sum @xmath0 diagrams , as in the bfkl formalism  @xcite ( for recent work see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or to even consider non - linear terms as in the colour glass condensate model  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is concerned with estimating the uncertainties on high energy neutrino cross - sections in the conventional nlo dglap formalism .",
    "however , the input assumptions of some of the pdf fits are arguably beyond this formalism , and such cases will be highlighted .",
    "pioneering estimates of high energy neutrino cross - sections were obtained at leading - order  @xcite using a pdf set ( cteq4 m ) which is now well out of date , yet these values continue to be used in analysing current data ( e.g. from anita @xcite ) .",
    "two of the present authors ( css ) evaluated  @xcite the cross - sections at nlo using the zeus pdfs which included more modern hera data @xcite and using a systematic procedure for estimating pdf uncertainties .",
    "more recently the cross - sections have been calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite ( ctw ) using the mstw2008nlo pdfs , which use hera data from the same vintage as the zeus pdfs and also account for pdf uncertainties .",
    "however , neither of these more recent works use the newly combined hera results which have increased the accuracy of low @xmath2 data by up to a factor of 3 ( see fig.3 of ref .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to re - evaluate the high energy cross - sections using the most up - to - date pdf sets , with particular emphasis on those which do use these precise , combined hera data .",
    "the calculation is made using pdfs which were evaluated in nlo dglap fits , and our calculation of the neutrino structure functions and cross - sections is also made consistently at nlo .",
    "the input pdfs we consider treat heavy quarks by using general - mass - variable - flavour number schemes @xcite , and we have also used such a scheme in our calculation of the structure functions .",
    "however , the difference between the use of a general - mass or a zero - mass scheme in the latter part of this procedure is negligible since the neutrino cross - sections are dominated by scattering at high @xmath1 .",
    "we consider carefully the source of uncertainty on the input pdfs ; these derive not only from the experimental uncertainty on the input data but also from model assumptions , and the form of the pdf parameterization .",
    "it is important to quantify these uncertainties carefully in order to be able to probe non - perturbative qcd effects at low @xmath2 @xcite and/or new physics beyond the standard model @xcite through a determination of the dis cross - section using cosmic neutrinos which have energies extending up at least to @xmath6  gev @xcite .",
    "the kinematics of lepton hadron scattering is described in terms of the variables @xmath1 , bjorken @xmath2 , and @xmath7 which measures the energy transfer between the lepton and hadron systems .",
    "the double differential charged current ( cc ) cross - section for neutrino and antineutrino production on isoscalar nucleon targets is given by @xcite @xmath8 where the reduced cross - sections @xmath9 are @xmath10 , \\label{eqn : nu}\\ ] ] @xmath11 , \\label{eqn : nubar}\\ ] ] and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are related directly to quark momentum distributions , with @xmath15 .",
    "the qcd predictions for these structure functions are obtained by solving the dglap evolution equations at nlo in the scheme with the renormalisation and factorization scales both chosen to be @xmath1 .",
    "these equations yield the pdfs at all values of @xmath1 provided these distributions have been input as functions of @xmath2 at some input scale @xmath16 .    in qcd at leading order , the structure function @xmath14 is identically zero , and the structure functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 for charged current neutrino interactions on isoscalar targets can be identified with quark distributions as follows : @xmath17 and for antineutrino interactions , @xmath18 at nlo these expressions must be convoluted with appropriate co - efficient functions in order to obtain the structure functions ( and @xmath14 is no longer zero ) but these expressions still give us a good idea of the dominant contributions .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath19 quark will be suppressed until scales @xmath20 , since the ckm element @xmath21 .",
    "although the dominant contributions to the cc cross - sections come from @xmath22 , this does not mean that the @xmath19 contribution is always suppressed , because the relevant scale for @xmath23 production is the virtual boson - nucleon centre - of - mass energy , @xmath24 , and the high energy cross - sections are dominated by contributions from very small @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kinreg ] ) .",
    "this point had been overlooked in earlier work , including our own  @xcite .",
    "the neutral current cross - sections on isoscalar targets are given by expressions similar to eqs .",

    "the pdf4lhc group has recently benchmarked modern parton density functions  @xcite .",
    "since our concern is with high energy neutrino cross - sections , rather than with lhc physics , we focus on pdf sets which make use of the newly combined accurate hera data @xcite .",
    "of all the pdfs considered by the pdf4lhc only herapdf1.0 @xcite ) and nnpdf2.0 @xcite used these data .",
    "however there has been a subsequent update of the cteq6.6 @xcite pdfs to ct10  @xcite which does use these data , while herapdf1.0 has recently updated to herapdf1.5  @xcite using an preliminary combination of hera data from 20032007 as well as the published combined data .",
    "we will utilise the ct10 and herapdf1.5 pdfs for the present study ; we also consider the mstw2008 pdfs in order to compare with other recent calculations of high energy neutrino cross - sections  @xcite , although we caution that these have _ not _ included the most accurate hera low @xmath2 data relevant to the present study .",
    "pdfs are generally determined by assuming a parameterization in @xmath2 which is valid at a starting value of @xmath35 , where the value of @xmath16 is chosen to be sufficiently large that perturbative qcd calculations can be applied .",
    "the form of the parameterization is usually @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is some smooth function of @xmath2 .",
    "such forms are assumed for the light quarks and the gluon , whereas heavy quarks are generated dyamically from boson - gluon fusion .",
    "the pdfs at all other scales @xmath38 are calculated by using the dglap equations to evolve the parameterized forms in @xmath1 .",
    "the evolved pdfs are then convoluted with nlo matrix elements to calculate scattering cross - sections for processes of interest .",
    "these cross - section predictions are then fitted to deep inelastic data over a broad range of the @xmath39 plane ( hera data cover 5 decades in both @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) in order to determine the parameters of the starting pdf parameterization .   and",
    "@xmath40 valence quarks are fixed by the momentum and number sum rules respectively while some other parameters are fixed by model assumptions ; the individual publications of the pdf groups should be consulted for details  @xcite . ] in this way a small number of parameters ( 1025 , depending on the pdf set ) are fitted to a large number ( 10002000 ) of data points . in this approach",
    "one can predict pdfs for @xmath2 values below those for which data exists because the fitted functional form may be applied for all @xmath2 , although uncertainties will naturally increase outside the fitted region . as we will illustrate",
    ", the uncertainty depends mainly on the theoretical prejudice underlying the parameterization at low @xmath2 .",
    "the hera data form the back - bone of pdf fits and are the _ only _ data which extend to the low @xmath2 region .",
    "herapdfs use exclusively these data , while mstw and ct also use older , fixed target data , drell - yan data including @xmath26 and @xmath27 production , and tevatron jet data . moreover herapdfs are unique in using only proton data , so they are free of any assumptions concerning heavy target corrections and deuterium binding corrections  @xcite .",
    "pdfs are presented accounting for the correlated systematic errors of the data as well as the statistical and uncorrelated sources , however , each pdf group has its own approach to the estimation of confidence limits on the uncertainties . a general discussion of approaches to estimating pdf uncertainties is given in refs .",
    "@xcite and the approaches used in the pdf sets considered here are reviewed in the pdf4lhc document  @xcite .",
    "pdf uncertainties can also arise from input assumptions made in the pdf fitting .",
    "these include the form of the input pdf parameterization at the starting scale for evolution , @xmath16 , the value of @xmath16 itself , the kinematic cuts made on the data entering the fit , the value of @xmath41 , the values of the heavy quark masses  or even the scheme used to account for heavy quark production within the dglap fits .",
    "the pdfs considered here all account for the heavy quark production using general mass variable flavour number schemes , although the specific schemes differ : mstw2008 and herapdf1.5 use the thorne - roberts scheme @xcite , whereas ct10/cteq6.6 use the acot scheme @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainties on the pdfs are presented as eigenvector error sets .",
    "these eigenvectors represent linear combinations of the pdf parameters which are uncorrelated with each other since they are obtained by diagonalisation of the error matrix of the fitted parameters .",
    "thus uncertainties on the pdfs , and quantities derived from them , can be calculated simply from adding in quadrature the difference between the independent eigenvector sets and the central pdf set .",
    "however the confidence limits represented by these pdf uncertainties are not always set using the conventional tolerances of @xmath42 for a 68% c.l . , and @xmath43 for a 90% c.l . instead both ct(eq ) and mstw _ increase _ the tolerances to account for the marginal inconsistencies of some of the input data sets , and for possible parameterization bias .",
    "the exact value of the tolerance is different for each eigenvector ( see the individual pdf publications for details ) . the average tolerance for @xmath44 c.l .",
    "is @xmath45 for mstw2008 and @xmath46 for cteq6.6 and ct10 .",
    "note that mstw supply both @xmath47 and @xmath44 c.l .",
    "sets , whereas ct10/cteq6.6 provide only @xmath44 c.l .",
    "sets ; since we wish to consider @xmath47 c.l .",
    "uncertainties , we simply scale the ct10 error sets by @xmath48 .",
    "the herapdfs use @xmath42 to set the size of their @xmath47 c.l . experimental errors .",
    "the combination of the hera data results in a consistent data set with small , well understood systematic errors  @xcite .",
    "the herapdf1.0 used nc and cc @xmath49 and @xmath50 cross - section data from the first phase of hera running 19922000 ( hera - i ) , while the herapdf1.5 update uses the preliminary combination of both hera - i and hera - ii ( 20032007 ) running .",
    "both of these herapdf sets provide not only pdf eigenvector error sets for experimental errors but also pdf variation sets which account for variation of input assumptions : namely variation of the charm and beauty masses , variation of the strangeness fraction in the sea , variation of the @xmath1 cuts applied to the data , variation of the parametrization at @xmath16 and of the value of @xmath16 itself .",
    "not all of these sources of uncertainty are specifically considered by the other pdfs .",
    "a potentially important uncertainty is the variation of the minimum @xmath1 cut for data entering the fit .",
    "this is set at @xmath51  gev@xmath5 for herapdf1.5 and at @xmath52  gev@xmath5 for ct10 and mstw2008 .",
    "although this cut should be high enough to avoid the non - perturbative region , it may include low @xmath2 data for which bfkl , or other beyond - dglap effects , are already important .",
    "hence we vary this cut to investigate the possible bias thus introduced .",
    "more importantly , herapdfs consider a variant of the input parameterization of the gluon at the starting scale which allows the gluon to become negative at low @xmath2 , @xmath1 . at nlo",
    "the gluon pdf does not have to be positive , although one might consider that it going negative signals a breakdown of the dglap formalism .",
    "this form of the gluon is in fact standard in the mstw2008 parameterization ; by contrast , the ct(eq ) analyses do not allow such negative gluon variants .",
    "however measurable quantities such as the longitudinal structure function @xmath53 , which is closely related to the gluon at small @xmath2 , _ must _ be positive",
    ". therefore we check whether this is the case when a negative gluon pdf is encountered .",
    "a further uncertainty concerns the choice of the value of @xmath41 because the shape of the low @xmath2 gluon and the value of @xmath41 are correlated through the dglap equations .",
    "all the pdf sets considered have been determined with a fixed value of @xmath41  0.120 for mstw2008 , 0.118 for ct / cteq and 0.1176 for herapdf1.5 .",
    "however pdf sets with a range of fixed values of @xmath54 are also supplied for all these pdfs .",
    "the uncertainty on the pdfs due to @xmath55 can be obtained by varying the value of @xmath55 by @xmath56 at @xmath47c.l .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the pdfs discussed above are calculated at nlo in the dglap formalism and when they are used to make predictions of the neutrino dis cross - sections the calculations should naturally be performed at a consistent order as we have done .",
    "we have also checked the impact of the use of nnlo pdfs and evolution for herapdf1.5 and found it to be negligible .",
    "the calculation of the cc and nc cross - sections in nlo has been performed using ` dispred `  @xcite . `",
    "qcdnum `  @xcite as included in lhapdf is used for the evaluation of the structure functions @xmath12 , @xmath53 and @xmath13 .",
    "the numerical integration of the differential cross - section is performed using the ` vegas ` monte carlo integration routine from the ` gsl ` library  @xcite , reducing the integration error to less than 1% .",
    "the most up - to - date pdfs in the lhapdf  @xcite format are given in form of grids with a limited kinematic range .",
    "for example , the grid extends down to @xmath57 in @xmath2 for the ct10 and herapdf1.5 sets and down to only @xmath58 for the mstw2008 set . below this range the pdfs `",
    "freeze ' , i.e. they take the value at the lower grid boundary .",
    "however , for very high energies the total cross - section has significant contributions from lower @xmath2 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : kinreg ] ) such that the cross - section calculated using the lhapdf sets will be too _",
    "small_. therefore , we have used implementations for the pdfs provided by the cteq  @xcite and mstw  @xcite groups which allow an extrapolation beyond the grid .",
    "of course , such an extrapolation using e.g. polynomials is not necessarily physical but in the absence of a grid that extends to low enough values of @xmath2 or the parametric form of the pdfs , this is the only viable alternative . we have checked the agreement between the cross - sections calculated with ` freezing ' and with the extrapolations and the difference is more than 50% for mstw2008 but only 3% for ct10 at @xmath59  gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : glu ] shows the predicted sea and gluon distributions from the herapdf1.5 fit and their fractional uncertainties , at various @xmath1 values . this shows the importance of the low @xmath2 contribution and illustrates that the pdf uncertainties are largest at low @xmath1 and at low @xmath2 .",
    "pdf uncertainties are also large at very high @xmath2 but this kinematic region is not important for scattering at high neutrino energies .    . ]",
    "this is seen from figure  [ fig : kinreg ] which indicates the kinematic regions in the @xmath39 plane which contribute to the neutrino cross - sections for two representative values of the neutrino energy : @xmath60  gev@xmath5 ( @xmath61  gev ) in the left panel and @xmath62  gev@xmath5 ( @xmath63  gev ) in the right panel .",
    "( we do not show the antineutrino cross - sections separately because these are very close to the neutrino cross - sections at high energy . )",
    "one can see that the dominant contributions come from @xmath64gev@xmath5 and @xmath65 for the lower neutrino energy , and @xmath66 , for the higher neutrino energy .",
    "thus although pdf uncertainties are large at low @xmath2 and low @xmath1 , we see that the dominant contributions to the cross - section do not come from the kinematic regions of greatest uncertainty for the pdfs .     plane and their contribution to the total neutrino cross - section using herapdf1.5 for two different values of @xmath67 .",

    "figure  [ fig : glucomp ] compares the gluon pdf and its uncertainty at @xmath68  gev@xmath5 for the three pdfs which we consider .",
    "this value of @xmath1 is in the middle of the range which contributes significantly to the neutrino cross - sections .",
    "we see that the central values of the gluon pdfs are all very similar , whereas the uncertainty estimates differ .",
    "the ct10 and herapdf1.5 uncertainties are actually very similar if we leave out member 52 from the ct10 error set .",
    "this error set was introduced into the ct10 analysis to allow for a larger uncertainty at low @xmath2  @xcite .",

    "the larger error band of mstw2008 is partly due to the fact that it does not include the most up to date hera data , which have significantly reduced errors at low @xmath2 .",

    "meanwhile we have provided the total dis cross - sections for cc and nc scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos on isoscalar targets in tables  [ tbl : nuhera ] and [ tbl : nubarhera ] and recommend these as a benchmark for use by experimentalists .",
    "these cross - sections as well as those for isoscalar targets are available from a webpage @xcite ; differential cross sections are available upon request . any measured deviation from these values would signal the need for new physics beyond the dglap formalism .",
