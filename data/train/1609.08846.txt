    "the constituent laws of friction are well known in the context of classical mechanics , with amontons - coulomb s ( ac ) law , which states that the static friction force is proportional to the applied normal load and independent of the apparent contact surface , and that the kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity @xcite .",
    "this law has proved to be correct in many applications .",
    "however , thanks to advances in technologies , with the possibility to perform high precision measurements and to design micro - structured interfaces , its validity range was tested and some violations were observed in experiments , e.g. @xcite@xcite . indeed , despite the apparent simplicity of the macroscopic laws , it is not easy to identify the origin of friction in terms of elementary forces and to identify which microscopic degrees of freedom are involved .    for these reasons , in recent years many models have been proposed @xcite , additionally incorporating the concepts of elasticity of materials , in order to explain the macroscopic friction properties observed in experiments and to link them to the forces acting on the elementary components of the system .",
    "although many results have been achieved , it turns out that there is no universal model suitable for all considered different materials and length scales .",
    "the reason is that the macroscopic behaviour , captured in first approximation by the ac friction law , is the result of many microscopic interactions acting at different scales .",
    "as pointed out in the series of works by nosonovsky and bhushan @xcite@xcite , friction is intrinsically a multiscale problem : the dominating effects change through the different length scales , and they span from molecular adhesion forces to surface roughness contact forces .",
    "hence , there are many possible theoretical and numerical approaches , depending on the system and the length scales involved ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an exhaustive overview ) .",
    "the situation is much more complicated if the surfaces are designed with patterned or hierarchical architectures , as occurs in many examples in nature : the hierarchical structure of the gecko paw has attracted much interest @xcite-@xcite , and research has focused on manufacturing artificial materials reproducing its peculiar properties of adhesion and friction . in general , the purpose of research in bio - inspired materials is to improve the overall properties ( e.g. mechanical ) by mimicking nature and exploiting mainly structural arrangements rather than specific chemical or physical properties . in this context , nano and biotribology",
    "is an active research field , both experimental and theoretical @xcite-@xcite .",
    "since hierarchical structures in nature present such peculiar properties , it is also interesting to investigate their role in the context of tribology , trying to understand , for example , how structured surfaces influence the friction coefficients .",
    "this can be done by means of numerical simulations based on ad - hoc simplified models , from which useful information can be retrieved in order to understand the general phenomenology . from a theoretic and numerical point of view , much remains to be done .",
    "for this reason , we propose a simple model , i.e. the spring - block model in one dimension , in order to explore how macroscopic friction properties depend on a complex surface geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_mod ] , we present the model in details and we discuss results for non structured surfaces , that are useful to understand the basic behaviour of the system . in section [ sec_patt ] , we present results for various types of patterned surfaces . in section [ conc ] ,",
    "we discuss them and provide the conclusions and future developments of this work .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the purpose of this work is to investigate the variation of friction coefficients in the presence of structured surfaces , also taking into account material elasticity . with this in mind",
    ", we start from a one dimensional spring - block model .",
    "this model was first introduced in 1967 by burridge and knopoff @xcite in the study of the elastic deformation of tectonic plates . despite its simplicity ,",
    "the model is still used not only in this field @xcite-@xcite , but also to investigate some aspects of dry friction on elastic surfaces , e.g. the static to dynamic friction transition @xcite-@xcite , stick - slip behaviour @xcite-@xcite and the role of regular patterning @xcite .",
    "the model is illustrated in figure [ figmodel ] : an elastic body , sliding along a rigid surface , is discretized in a chain of blocks of mass @xmath0 connected by springs of stiffness @xmath1 , attached to a slider moving at constant velocity @xmath2 by means of springs of stiffness @xmath3 to take into account shear deformation .",
    "the surface of the sliding plane is considered as a first approximation homogeneous and infinitely rigid .",
    "friction between the blocks and the surface can be introduced in many ways : for example in @xcite it is modeled through springs that can attach and detach during motion .",
    "however , in our study we will use a classical ac friction force between blocks and surface through microscopic friction coefficients , as it is done , for example , in @xcite . in this way it is possible to directly introduce a pressure load as in the figure .",
    "hence , on each block the acting forces are :    a.   the shear elastic force due to the slider uniform motion , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the position of the block @xmath6 and @xmath7 is its rest position . b.   the internal elastic restoring force between blocks @xmath8 . c.   the normal force @xmath9 , which is the total normal force divided for the number of blocks in contact with the surface .",
    "d.   a viscous force @xmath10 to account for damping effects , with @xmath11 chosen in the underdamped regime .",
    "e.   the ac friction force @xmath12 : if the block @xmath6 is at rest , the friction force is equal and opposite to the resulting moving force , up to the threshold @xmath13 .",
    "when this limit is exceeded , a constant dynamic friction force opposes the motion , i.e. @xmath14 . the microscopic friction coefficients of each block , namely @xmath15 and @xmath16 , are assigned through a gaussian statistical dispersion to account for the random roughness of the surface .",
    "thus , the probability distribution for the static coefficient is @xmath17 } $ ] , where @xmath18 denotes the mean microscopic static coefficient and @xmath19 is its standard deviation .",
    "the same distribution is adopted for the dynamic coefficient ( substituting subscript @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the macroscopic friction coefficients , obtained through the sum of all the friction forces on the blocks , will be denoted as @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "hence , we have a system of equations for the block motion that can be solved numerically with a fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "since the friction coefficients of the blocks are randomly extracted at each run , the final result of any observable consists on an average of various repetitions of the simulation .",
    "usually , we assume an elementary integration time step of @xmath24 ms and we repeat the simulation about twenty times .    in order to relate the model to a realistic situation",
    ", we fix the macroscopic quantities , i.e. the global shear modulus @xmath25 mpa , the young s modulus @xmath26 mpa , the mass density @xmath27 g/@xmath28 ( typical values for a rubber - like material with poisson ratio @xmath29 ) , the total length @xmath30 , the transversal dimensions of the blocks @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the number of blocks @xmath33 .",
    "these quantities are then related to the stiffnesses @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the length of the blocks @xmath36 , and their mass @xmath37 .",
    "the default values of the parameters are specified in table [ par_table ] .",
    "an example of the simulated friction force time evolution of the system with these values is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    ".values of the default parameters of the model . for the microscopic friction coefficients",
    "we denote in round brackets the standard deviation of their gaussian dispersion .",
    "the total length @xmath30 and the number @xmath33 of blocks will be specified for each considered case . [",
