    "schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) has been introduced to deal with conformally invariant random curves .",
    "these curves may for instance be thought of as interfaces in two dimensional critical statistical systems .",
    "sle is by now a ( if not `` the '' ) standard tool to efficiently formulate questions concerning these curves and , in many simple but important cases , to get the answer by routine computations .",
    "see @xcite for detailed introductions to sle",
    ".    having reached this depth of insight in the critical case , it is a natural question to wonder how sle measures are deformed when considering interfaces in statistical models not at the critical point but slightly away from it ( still in the scaling regime ) .",
    "interfaces out of criticality are at the moment very poorly understood to say the least .",
    "there are several reasons to invest some efforts in this , some of them more mathematical and some more physical , though the frontier is fuzzy .",
    "the first obvious remark is that interfaces , or domain walls , are macroscopic structures that can be ( and are ) observed more directly than microscopic correlations ( though the average over the sample of a local magnetization is the first accessible observable ) .",
    "so they are interesting to study for their own sake .",
    "a second obvious remark is that some interface models are purely geometric .",
    "the canonical example is percolation , for which all non - trivial observables are non local and deal with cluster correlations .",
    "but even if there are local observables described by a local quantum field theory , this alone does not yield a straightforward description of interfaces : local quantum field theory does not deal easily with extended objects . as an example , the fields in the kac table for minimal conformal field theories form a closed algebra but other fields which are non - local with respect to this algebra are crucial to describe the interface .",
    "sle and its perturbations provide a framework to decipher properties of such non - local excitations .",
    "a situation where this should be relevant is the @xmath0 model : one can see the introduction of defects on the boundary to force the existence in the statistical mechanics system of macroscopic interfaces pinned at special points as a trick to get rid of some of the difficulties involved in the direct study of a gas of loops at all scales in the continuum .    of interest both to the physicist and",
    "the mathematician is the concept of change of measure . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the starting point is often a formal measure @xmath1 whose rigorous construction is usually a formidable challenge .",
    "the action @xmath2 may depend on parameters and changing these parameters leads to families of measures .",
    "for instance , if @xmath3 is a perturbation of @xmath4 by some operator @xmath5 one gets formally that @xmath6 , or in a more measure - theoretic language , that @xmath7 is the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 . in general quantum field theory ,",
    "it is well - know that there is something poisonous in this statement due to renormalization but a rigorous analysis is mostly out of reach .",
    "however the framework of interfaces growth is a playground were analogous questions can be tackled . by this",
    "we mean two things : first that for some concrete models ( see below ) one can prove that some interfaces measures have or do not have radon - nikodym derivatives with respect to others , and second that when the answer is no for two interfaces measures , it is also no for the two measures on local degrees of freedoms that induce the interface measures . to elaborate on this issue , we need to introduce some background .",
    "consider first a finite system described by statistical mechanics .",
    "each configuration has a boltzmann weight , usually strictly positive , which may depend on some continuous parameters . then",
    "two measures corresponding to different values of the parameters have a well - defined radon - nikodym derivative . in the thermodynamic ( a fortiori in the continuum )",
    "limit , this is another matter . in general , a positive measure @xmath10 is said to be absolutely continuous with respect to another positive measure @xmath11 on the same space if for any set @xmath12 such that @xmath13 there is a set @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , more loosely , if negligible sets for @xmath16 are also negligible for @xmath17 . under a technical condition",
    ", this ensures that there is a @xmath16-measurable function @xmath18 , called the radon - nikodym derivative of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath16 , such that @xmath19 .",
    "the theorem is obvious for finite or countable spaces but delicate in general , see e.g. @xcite . observe that one does not look at individual configurations ( which have zero measure usually ) but at subsets of configurations .",
    "so the issue is that when going to the thermodynamic limit , a subset of configurations can carry a finite weight for a first choice of parameters but a vanishing weight for a second one .",
    "then the first measure is said to be singular with respect to the second .",
    "suppose now that the system has boundary conditions imposing the presence of one or several interfaces .",
    "from the point of view of statistical mechanics , one could obtain the measure on interfaces as the outcome of summing all the boltzmann weights of configurations of local degrees of freedom leading to a given position of the interface , and the same holds in the continuum limit if we assume that interfaces still make sense in that limit .",
    "if the measure on local degrees of freedom depends on parameters , so does usually the measure on interfaces .",
    "assume that @xmath17 and @xmath16 are measures on local degrees of freedom for two sets of parameters , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the corresponding measures on interfaces .",
    "then if a set @xmath22 of interfaces has measure @xmath23 for @xmath20 , the set @xmath24 of local configurations leading to an interface in @xmath22 has measure @xmath23 for @xmath17 .",
    "so if @xmath17 has a radon - nikodym derivative with respect to @xmath16 , so does @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the opposite does not need to hold .",
    "along these lines a spectacular result has been obtained in ref.@xcite . for site percolation on the 2d triangular lattice ( where each site is occupied with probability @xmath25 and empty with probability @xmath26 independently of the other sites ) the measure describing interfaces in the off - critical continuum limit ( if @xmath27 is the lattice mesh , one lets @xmath25 go to the critical value @xmath28 while keeping @xmath29 fixed ) is singular with respect to the critical interface measure . by the above remark",
    ", this also entails that the local measures on hexagons are singular in the continuum limit , a fact that can be understood as follows .",
    "the typical fluctuation of the number of occupied sites is @xmath30 because there are @xmath31 independent sites .",
    "however if @xmath32 , the typical asymmetry is @xmath33 , which is much larger that the fluctuation , so one can assert with certainty that an individual sample is critical or not .",
    "in fact , the same counting implies that on any set containing @xmath34 hexagons , the asymmetry @xmath35 is much larger than the fluctuation @xmath36 if @xmath37 .",
    "the critical percolation interface is bounded by @xmath38 hexagons so it covers enough of the sample to feel a macroscopic effect of the tiny bias out of criticality .",
    "of course , this is cheating because the interface as a set is correlated to the hexagon configuration .",
    "but this leads to expect that along a typical interface sample out of criticality the asymmetry between occupied and empty sites causes a systematic excess of turns in one direction with respect to the other which is larger than what could be attributed to fluctuations .",
    "this is the intuitive basis for the result in @xcite , but the actual proof involves subtleties that are well beyond the scope of the above intuition .    the theorem in @xcite is proved essentially without any recourse to sle and stochastic processes .",
    "however , sle and more generally stochastic processes can also provide relevant tools to address these matters .",
    "computing the interface measure from the local boltzmann weights is a very hard task , even at a critical point , and the approach of sle was to study measures on interfaces , defined directly in the continuum , under two conditions , conformal invariance ( covariance under conformal transport to go from one domain to another ) and the domain markov property ( which asserts that the probability distribution of the curves in a domain conditioned on an initial portion of the curves is identical to the probability distribution of the curves but in the domain minus the portion on which we condition ) .",
    "this analysis led schramm to the classification  in a one parameter family usually indexed by @xmath39  of conformally invariant measures on random curves drawn on simply connected planar domains .",
    "this should be contrasted with the present status of conformal field theory , were several mathematical axiomatics have been proposed but no general classification is in view .",
    "one of the remarkable features of schramm s approach and result is that the measure on critical curves can be realized in a natural way as a 1d brownian motion measure .",
    "this goes via a construction of interfaces via a stochastic growth process : to any continuous non self - crossing curve joining two boundary points of a domain of the complex plane one can associate , via a trick discovered by loewner involving a refinement of the riemann mapping theorem , a real continuous function @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "when the curves in the domain have the statistics of a critical interface model , there is a @xmath42 such that @xmath43 is a brownian motion @xmath44 .",
    "in particular the @xmath40 corresponding to a critical interface measure is a markov process .",
    "suppose now that the curves in the domain are non - critical interfaces for an example illustrating the passage to the continuum limit in the case of loop - erased random walks .",
    "] . for such measures , conformal invariance",
    "is broken i.e. the measures are not transported trivially by conformal transformations in a change of domain .",
    "this is because going out of criticality introduces a scale in the system , the correlation length @xmath45 .",
    "but the domain markov property , which has its roots in the locality of the underlying statistical mechanics system , usually survives .",
    "the loewner trick can still be used to associate to each realization of the interface a continuous function @xmath40 for @xmath46 , and one of the ways to have a description of the interface measure would be to give the measure on @xmath40 .    there is little doubt that the probability that the interface has a certain topology with respect to a finite number of points in the domain should depend smoothly on the correlation length @xmath45 .",
    "there is a small subtlety here : a collection of consistent finite dimensional distributions fixes the law of a process , but the fact that all finite dimensional distributions depend smoothly on @xmath45 does not imply that the measures of the corresponding processes depend smoothly on @xmath45 .",
    "some observables , like the fractal dimension , are computed by using an infinite number of points but are nevertheless expected to be local enough to remain the same out of criticality , in particular they depend smoothly on @xmath45 . on the other hand , the construction of @xcite introduces an observable that depends on infinitely many points on the interface ( but on arbitrarily small segments ) and uses it to prove that the measures at criticality and out of criticality are not mutually absolutely continuous .    at scales",
    "much smaller that the correlation length , i.e. in the ultraviolet regime , the deviation from criticality is small and , as a function of @xmath47 , the off - critical @xmath40 is expected to share some local features with its critical counterpart .",
    "this raises the question whether @xmath40 can be decomposed as @xmath48 , i.e. as the sum of a brownian motion ( scaled by @xmath49 ) plus some process @xmath50 whose precise regularity would remain to be understood but at least tamer than @xmath44 on small scales .",
    "the results from @xcite imply that there must be a problem with that decomposition for percolation .",
    "the authors in @xcite argue that the decomposition @xmath51 should exist ( @xmath52 for percolation ) , but that @xmath50 is too wild to expect absolute continuity .",
    "stochastic calculus for continuous stochastic processes deals with processes @xmath53 that are called in the probabilistic jargon semi - martingales .",
    "this means that they are defined as functionals of a brownian motion @xmath44 and have the following properties .",
    "first , @xmath53 is causal ( mathematicians say adapted ) in the sense that @xmath53 can be computed knowing only @xmath54\\}$ ] roughly speaking .",
    "second , there is a splitting @xmath55 as a sum where @xmath56 is a stochastic integral is well - defined if the process @xmath57 is causal and @xmath58 is almost surely finite .",
    "then the stochastic integral itself is also causal .",
    "note that @xmath59 does not need to be a martingale ( i.e. to be conserved in average ) because it can get too large .",
    "however it becomes a martingale if it is stopped as soon as its absolute value reaches @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "so it is called a _ local _",
    "martingale , a term we sometimes use in the sequel .",
    "thus being bounded is a sufficient condition for the process @xmath62 to be a martingale .",
    "a milder useful criterion for being a true martingale is that @xmath63 . ]",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath50 is of locally finite variation , i.e. @xmath65 when the @xmath66 is taken over all subdivisions @xmath67 for fixed @xmath47 .",
    "the separation of scales ( very crudely , the variation of @xmath56 is of order @xmath68 while that of @xmath50 is of order @xmath69 ) between the two terms implies that such a decomposition , if it exists , is unique . in our case",
    ", we would have @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath50 is regular enough , the measures on the processes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , @xmath73 $ ] are absolutely continuous with respect to each other .",
    "but for percolation @xmath50 is conjectured to be too wild",
    ".    now look at scales large compared to @xmath45 . in this regime ,",
    "the behavior is different and the interface should look like another sle with a new @xmath74 .",
    "take the ising model as an example . at criticality @xmath75",
    "but if the temperature is raised above the critical point , general renormalization group arguments indicate that at large scale the interface looks like the interface at infinite temperature .",
    "from the explicit example of the hexagonal lattice ( plus maybe some confidence in universality ) this limit is percolation and @xmath76 .",
    "but the infrared regime is never attained in a bounded domain .",
    "let us close this long introduction by stressing again that conformal covariance and the domain markov property have a rather different status .",
    "whereas conformal invariance emerges ( at best ) in the continuum limit at criticality , the domain markov property makes sense and is satisfied on the lattice without tuning parameters for many systems of interest .",
    "it can be considered as a manifestation of locality ( in the physicists terminology ) . hence the domain markov property is still expected to hold off criticality .",
    "however the consequences of this property on @xmath40 do not seem to have a simple formulation . as for conformal `` covariance ''",
    ", there is a trick to preserve it formally out of the critical point : instead of perturbing with a scaling field @xmath77 times a coupling _ constant _",
    "@xmath78 , one perturbs by a scaling field times a density @xmath79 of appropriate weight , in such a way that @xmath80 is a @xmath81-form .",
    "if @xmath79 has compact support , one also gets rid of infrared divergences that occur in unbounded domain .",
    "we shall use this trick in some places , but beware that if perturbation theory contains divergences , problems with scale invariance will arise , hence the cautious word `` formally '' used above .",
    "we are now in position to give a summary of our approach and results .    besides ref .",
    "@xcite , a few works on off - critical sle have already appeared but the study of this problem is still in his infancy . in ref.@xcite , we exposed a possible framework for dealing with deformations of sle adapted to off - critical perturbations of the underlying statistical models . this approach links off - critical sle to off - critical partition functions and field theories .",
    "it was perturbatively applied , to first order in the perturbing mass only , to off - critical loop erased random walks ( lerw ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop this method for two simple off - critical sle , namely massive sle(2 ) and massive sle(4 ) .",
    "these perturbations are simple enough to be treated non perturbatively .",
    "apparently some unpublished related work on similar perturbations of sle has been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that the perturbation of the ising model by the energy operator , corresponding to a shift of the temperature , is amenable to the same techniques .",
    "these three cases ( corresponding to certain perturbations of @xmath82 i.e. central charge @xmath83 all correspond to free field theory and this is the crucial point for our approach because it leads to computations of ( variations of ) determinants .    for more general cases ,",
    "the situation is less favorable .",
    "basic rules of cft fix unambiguously the process @xmath50 alluded to before to first order in perturbation theory but not to second order and beyond . indeed , for the computation @xmath84 at order @xmath60 in @xmath78 , one needs first to evaluate @xmath85 , which involves two boundary changing operators but @xmath60 bulk fields .",
    "so if @xmath86 the differential equation coming from the fact that the boundary fields are degenerate at level @xmath81 is enough to fix ( almost ) everything .",
    "but if @xmath87 a detailed knowledge of the operator algebra of the theory , i.e. which states are allowed as intermediate states in a correlator , is required .",
    "one could restrict to perturbations of minimal models by minimal operators .",
    "then the value of @xmath88 can be expressed in terms of more and more complicated contour integrals .",
    "the explicit perturbative computation of @xmath89 looks even more formidable as it involves renormalization to remove singularities in the @xmath90 integrals .",
    "anyway , many interesting perturbations are not generically by minimal operators , as shown be the example of the operator controlling the hausdorff dimension of sle , which means perturbing the sle measure using the `` natural '' length ( i.e. the continuum limit of the discrete lattice length ) of interfaces .    one word on our strategy .",
    "that an interface measure is the result of tracing over the other degrees of freedom of some statistical mechanics model yields to some general compatibility conditions . at criticality , this is the clue to relate sle to conformal field theory ( cft ) : via the growth process construction of interfaces , cft becomes a provider of martingales for sle , i.e. of observables which are conserved in average under the growth process .",
    "out of criticality , the quantum field theory that describes macroscopic correlations in the system close to criticality should for the same reasons be a martingale provider for the corresponding interface measure .",
    "this is hopefully enough to characterize this measure .",
    "this is the approach that we follow in this paper , using the ratio of partition functions as observable .",
    "sle is most simply formulated in the upper half plane @xmath91 .",
    "there , it describes curves originating from a boundary point that we choose to be the origin @xmath23 of the real axis .",
    "the curves @xmath92}$ ] , parameterized by @xmath47 , are coded in a conformal map @xmath93 uniformizing @xmath94}$ ] onto @xmath91 . to make this map unique",
    "we require that its behavior at infinity is @xmath95 .",
    "this is called the hydrodynamic normalization with the parameter @xmath47 identified with half the capacity .",
    "the sle measures are then defined by making the maps @xmath93 random and solutions of the stochastic schramm - loewner evolution : @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath44 a standard one dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the points of the curves are reconstructed from the maps @xmath93 via @xmath98 and the measure on the curves is that induced via this reconstruction formula from the one on the maps @xmath93 . above @xmath99",
    "is a possible drift which depends on the variants of sle one is considering .",
    "different variants of sle correspond to different boundary conditions one imposes to the critical statistical models . as explained in @xcite these drifts are intimately related to the partition functions of the conformal field theories describing the continuum limit of these statistical models",
    ".    now look at perturbations away from criticality , with a perturbing parameter @xmath100 which may depend on position . in the sequel",
    "we denote by @xmath101 the corresponding measure on interfaces , so that @xmath102 is the critical measure .",
    "we assume that the perturbation simply modifies the drift ( see the motivating discussion above , together with its `` caveat '' ) so that the schramm - loewner stochastic equation is @xmath103}_t+ f^{[m]}_tdt\\ ] ] with @xmath104}_t$ ] another standard brownian motion and the drift @xmath105}_t$ ] depending on the perturbation driving the systems out of criticality .",
    "however , contrary to the critical case , the off - critical drift @xmath105}_t$ ] at time @xmath47 depends on the full past history of the curves but in these cases one can introduce a finite number of auxiliary random processes in such a way as to get a usual ( vector ) markov process .",
    "it is doubtful that such a trick exists for off - critical interfaces . ] .",
    "if the drift @xmath105}_t$ ] is well - defined , then under regularity conditions , the off - critical measure can be shown to be regular with respect to the critical one so that the radon - nikodym derivative @xmath106 exists and the two measures differ by a density . in that case ,",
    "expectation values of events depending only on the curves up to time @xmath47 differ in the off - critical @xmath107}[\\cdots]$ ] and critical @xmath108 $ ] measures by the insertion of a positive martingale : @xmath109}[\\cdots ] = { \\mathsf{e}}[\\ , { \\cal z}_t^{[m]}\\ , \\cdots ] \\ ] ] here , @xmath110}$ ] has to be a positive martingale for the critical process .",
    "its insertion reflects the difference between the boltzmann weights of the underlying statistical model at criticality and away from it .",
    "again its existence is not guarantied .",
    "but in the favorable case , by girsanov s theorem @xcite , it is linked to the off - critical drift by @xmath105}_t - f^0_t=\\kappa\\ , \\partial_{\\xi_t}\\log { \\cal z}_t^{[m]}$ ] .",

    "of course it is only a first step and a lot would remain to be done to determine and compute properties of the off - critical curves .",
