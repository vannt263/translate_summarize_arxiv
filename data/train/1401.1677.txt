    "sec : introduction    the reflecting properties of mirrors and the focusing properties of lenses have been known since ancient times , general possibilities to tailor reflection and transmission of plane waves using thin metasufaces have been realized only recently . in what concerns the extended control over transmission ,",
    "the transmitarray ( e.g. @xcite ) is the known technique based on the use of two parallel antenna arrays .",
    "this concept has been recently generalized as the meta - transmit - array in @xcite , where subwavelength ( in the transverse plane ) elements are used .",
    "another class of transmission - phase controlling layers is the phase - shifting surface @xcite .",
    "most of these structures contain several layers and are considerably thick in terms of the wavelength . but using various frequency - selective surfaces ( e.g. @xcite ) including inhomogeneous in the layer plane @xcite , transmission phase can be controlled also by electrically thin layers . eliminating reflection while controlling transmission phase is possible using huygens s metasurfaces @xcite .",
    "some general limitations on realizing thin one - way transparent sheets have been published in @xcite .    in this paper , we will focus on thin composite layers which fully reflect incident waves with a possibility to engineer their phase response . a known approach to control the reflection phase is the use of reflectarrays ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "reflectarrays for microwave applications are usually realized as arrays of resonant metal patches over a metal ground plane .",
    "all the patches of the array usually have the same shape but slightly varying dimensions , so that the resonance frequency of the individual antenna elements varies to ensure the desired variations of the reflection phase over the array surface .",
    "alternatively , varying reactive loading of the individual antenna elements can be used . because of the use of resonant patches and considerable electrical distance between the array elements , homogenization of these layers is not possible , making realizations of conformal arrays on bent surfaces difficult .",
    "other limitations are narrow frequency band and the presence of the metal ground plane which forbids transmission at all frequencies .    other conventional structures which provide full reflection with engineered phase are artificial magnetic walls and high - impedance surfaces ( his ) .",
    "in contrast to electric walls ( perfectly conducting surfaces ) , magnetic walls do not reverse the phase of reflected waves offering interesting possibilities for antenna and microwave applications .",
    "magnetic walls have a high surface impedance due to zero tangential magnetic field on their surface @xcite .",
    "corrugated conducting surface was one of the first designs introduced to exhibit a high surface impedance @xcite .",
    "this is a transmission - line based structure utilizing many shorted quarter - wavelength transmission lines positioned close to each other , which transform the zero impedance at the end of the transmission lines to a very high reactive impedance at the open ends of the transmission - line sections .",
    "the main shortcoming of this structure is its large electrical thickness . in order to decrease the layer thickness , it is possible to fill the grooves with a high - permittivity dielectric or meander them .",
    "later on , various corrugated surfaces have been utilized as artificial soft and hard surfaces @xcite .",
    "alternatively , to realize high reactive surface impedance , it is possible to use a parallel resonance with a capacitive frequency - selective surface , usually an array of metal patches ( so called _ mushroom structure _ @xcite ) .",
    "this basic idea has been used by many researchers designing various structures realizing high surface impedance .",
    "analytical models of these devices can be found in many papers @xcite .",
    "the mushroom layer his proposed by sievenpiper @xcite has been used in many antenna applications : screens in mobile phones , absorbers , tunable antennas , for reducing thickness of steerable antennas , in reconfigurable antennas , e.g. @xcite . in paper",
    "@xcite a high - impedance surface with a non - uniform distribution of the resonant frequency over the surface has been used as a reflectarray , with the advantage of a wider bandwidth as compared to the traditional designs as antenna arrays @xcite . as for any linear and passive structure , there are fundamental causality limitations on the thickness and bandwidth of high - impedance surfaces @xcite . the main feature which considerably limits the functionalities of the mushroom structure is the presence of an electric wall ( ground plane ) .",
    "the structure interacts with a very large frequency spectrum , but the transmittance is always zero .",
    "furthermore , the reflection coefficient seen from the side of the ground plane is always that of a conducting wall ( @xmath0 if losses are negligible ) , unless a multi - layer system is used .    to realize a magnetic wall in one single sheet",
    ", one needs to have a sheet of magnetic current .",
    "there are no free magnetic charges in nature , and only using dense arrays of resonant magnetic moments it is possible to effectively create a sheet of magnetic current .",
    "magnetic walls made of a dense array of single and double split - ring resonators have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this design does not include any ground plane in its structure , but the possible functionalities are still limited because the reflection coefficient seen from the opposite sides of the sheet is always the same .",
    "the main questions which we address in this paper are : what are the minimum necessary physical requirements for realizing a single - sheet full - reflection structure with different and controllable phases of reflected waves from its different sides ?",
    "are the conventional designs of high - impedance surfaces and reflectarrays the only and optimal ways to control the reflecting properties of thin layers ? it is obvious that to be able to fully control reflection , we need to ensure that the thin layer is polarizable both electrically and magnetically .",
    "thus , we assume that the thinnest possible realization is a planar array of small dipolar particles in which both electric and magnetic moments can be induced by the incident fields . from the earlier studies of dipolar arrays @xcite it is known that in order to be able to realize different reflectivity properties for the opposite sides of the sheet , the induced electric and magnetic dipoles must be coupled as in a bi - anisotropic particle @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", bi - anisotropy of conventional full - reflection layers with asymmetric response of their two sides has not been noticed in earlier studies .",
    "furthermore , an interesting question is if it is possible to have a single layer of bi - anisotropic particles which offers different reflection phase distributions on its two faces ( e.g. , a uniform reflection phase when illuminated from one side and a non - uniform reflection phase distribution from the other side ) ? to address these questions , it is necessary to find out which physical phenomena govern the response of traditional full - reflection layers and understand what parameters of reflecting sheets are required to realize arbitrary reflection phase responses .    in this paper",
    ", we will analytically and numerically show that the most general asymmetric single - layer full - reflection structures can be realized as single arrays of passive lossless bi - anisotropic particles possessing bi - anisotropic omega coupling @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that using the proposed metasurfaces one can tailor the reflected wave phase independently for illuminations coming from the opposite sides of the composite sheet .",
    "we will see that using the physical optics principle ( also known as the kirchhoff approximation @xcite ) the proposed method is applicable for layers with different non - uniform phase distributions on their two surfaces .",
    "this study will also lead us to discover other extreme properties of so called _ balanced bi - anisotropic particles _ @xcite . with the ability to fully control",
    "the phase of waves reflected from a planar composite sheet , it becomes possible to tailor reflected waves in the most general fashion .",
    "for example , one side of a thin planar sheet can act as a focusing reflector ( emulating a parabolic mirror ) , while the other side can , for instance , deflect incident plane waves into a desired direction .",
    "this study is limited to the case of plane - wave illuminations at normal incidence .",
    "we consider a generic metamirror as a composite planar layer formed by periodically arranged electrically small unit cells or small particles .",
    "these cells are polarizable both electrically and magnetically",
    ". the electromagnetic properties of the cells we model by general linear relations between the induced electric ( @xmath1 ) and magnetic ( @xmath2 ) dipole moments and the incident fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 at the positions of the particles as = .",
    ", eq : a where the effective polarizabilities ( marked by hats ) include the effects of particle interactions in the array . because here we are interested in layers acting as full reflectors for arbitrary polarizations of the incident field , the dyadic coefficients in the above equations should be invariant with respect to rotation around the unit vector @xmath5 normal to the layer plane : = _ ij=_ij^co_t+_ij^crj_t , formswhere @xmath6 is the transverse unit dyadic and @xmath7 is the vector - product operator .",
    "the amplitudes of plane waves generated by the array are proportional to the surface - averaged electric and magnetic surface current densities , which are related to the induced cell dipole moments as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the area of each unit cell . assuming the normal incidence of the incident plane wave ( the induced dipole moments are the same in all unit cells )",

    "ideal reflectors should not change the wave polarization at reflection , so we demand that in ( [ eq : b ] ) the coefficients at the rotation operator @xmath14 equal zero . in this work ,",
    "we limit the study to reciprocal layers , in which case the electric and magnetic polarizabilities are symmetric dyadics ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the requirement of the absence of any cross - polarized response does not allow any chirality in the layer s topology , because both @xmath17 and @xmath18 . under these restrictions ,",

    "before studying general metamirrors , let us first consider the simplest problem of realizing electric or magnetic wall response for illumination from both sides of the array .",

    ". using and , we get the conditions on the polarizability of a single particle which is necessary to realize an effective electric wall response : \\{-}=0,()=k_0 ^ 36_0 .",
    "eq : mthe first condition means that the particles are at the resonance and the second condition means that there is no absorption in the particles ( the only loss term is due to dipole scattering ) .",
    "this is a known result telling that an array of resonant lossless electric dipole particles behaves as an electric wall at the particle resonance .",
    "the first equation also shows that the resonance frequency is the frequency at which the grid comes to a resonance , and this frequency is not the same as the resonance frequency of a single particle in free space .",
    "let us compare the behavior of a grid of resonant electric dipoles with that of a thin homogeneous slab ( the relative permittivity @xmath35 and the thickness @xmath36 ) .",
    "for a thin homogeneous slab the equivalent sheet impedance reads ( eq .",
    "( 2.152 ) @xcite ) z_g =- j_0(_r-1)k_0d , eq : nand , obviously , the electric - wall response ( @xmath37 ) can be reached only if @xmath38 .",
    "if the imaginary part of @xmath35 tends to infinity , we have the case of a perfect conductor , and if the real part of @xmath35 tends to infinity , we have the response analogous to the above case of an array of lossless resonant electric dipoles .",
    "indeed , in the case of the dipole array the perfect electric conductor ( pec ) response is reached when the particles are at resonance and their polarizabilities in the grid tend to infinity . after appropriate homogenization , this corresponds to a thin layer of a dielectric with @xmath39 .",
    "note that a single sheet of homogeneous surface electric current radiates symmetrically in the forward and back directions . in our case of full reflection",
    ", the amplitude of the reflected plane wave equals to that of the incident plane wave .",
    "the plane wave created by this array into the forward direction also has the same amplitude as the incident field , but it is out of phase with that , so that the total field behind the grid is zero .",
    "note that the discrete nature of the grid is not essential for this interference effect ( cancellation of the incident field behind the grid ) .",
    "it is essential in order to ensure the resonant response of the grid impedance , which in a homogeneous layer is possible only with @xmath40 .",
    "similarly to the above case of the electric wall , inspecting we can find that the magnetic - wall response from both sides of the array ( the reflection coefficient @xmath41 and the transmission coefficient @xmath21 ) is achieved if = 0,=2sj.eq : othe effective magnetic polarizability @xmath23 is related to the polarizibility of the same particle in free space as in .",

    "similarly to the case of the electric - wall response of resonant electric dipoles , we find y_m = sj 1 - 12=0.eq : rthus , an array of lossless resonant magnetic dipoles behaves as a magnetic wall from both sides of the array at the resonant frequency of the array which is determined , using and , by the following values of the particle polarizabilities : \\{-}=0,()=k_0 ^ 36_0 .",
    "eq : s      let us next consider if and how one can realize a sheet reflecting plane waves symmetrically from both sides , but with an arbitrary reflection phase .",
    "we use with @xmath45 and @xmath46 to find the effective electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the unit cells which ensure that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",

    "next , we study metamirrors providing different reflection phases when illuminated from their two sides . equations clearly show that in order to achieve asymmetric full - reflection response from a single layer of small unit cells , we need to invoke magnetoelectric coupling of the omega type ( @xmath50 )",
    ". follows from the reciprocity of the structure @xcite . ] in order to get more physical insight into these phenomena , as an example of asymmetric metamirrors we will first consider the classical realization of the mushroom layer high - impedance surface ( his ) . similarly to generic arrays of small particles , the mushroom layer is electrically thin , and at the resonance it has the reflection coefficient @xmath51 ( magnetic wall response ) from the side of the patch array , while the reflection coefficient from the opposite side is @xmath0 , because the structure has a pec ground plane .",
    "the response is the same as we expect from an array of bi - anisotropic particles with appropriately designed omega coupling .",

    "clearly , if this structure is excited by external uniform electric fields , the currents induced on the patch array and on the ground plane are different , meaning that applied uniform electric field induces some magnetic moment ( an effective circulating electric current ) .",
    "what are the electric and magnetic polarizations induced in a conventional mushroom layer and what are the effective `` polarizabilities '' ?",
    "the expectation is that the mushroom layer exhibits the same response as a resonant layer of bi - anisotropic ( omega ) particles .      to understand the electromagnetic coupling which takes place in mushroom layers , we derive the effective polarizabilities of these layers by studying their excitations in external electric and magnetic fields . to find these polarizabilities , we need to excite the his layer by electric field or magnetic fields which are approximately uniform inside the his layer .",

    "[ fig : distance ] ) . as it was explained in the previous section",

    "the reason is the intrinsic relation between electric , magnetic and magnetoelectric polarizabilities of small wire omega particles ( see @xcite ) = - .",
    "eq : oooin some cases , this condition limits the accessible properties of wire omega particles which does not allow one to fully satisfy the requirements in .",
    "however , as is shown in @xcite , this restriction is due to specific symmetry properties of induced current distribution and does not hold for general omega particles .",
    "it was shown above that to design a layer of bi - anisotropic particles which acts as a his one needs particles with balanced electric and magnetic polarizabilities , but the magnetoelectric coupling coefficient should not be balanced with the electric and magnetic polarizabilities ( see ) .",
    "it is seen from that there is an intrinsic limitation for wire omega particles .",
    "condition shows that as soon as we have a wire omega particle with balanced electric and magnetic polarizabilities , the coupling coefficient will be automatically balanced with the electric and magnetic ones .",
    "this is in contrast with the requirement in .",
    "let us still consider another possibility to use wire omega particles to realize @xmath95 reflection layer , which appears thanks to the freedom to choose the area of the unit cells @xmath10 so that all the polarizabilities in become balanced .",

    "the thicknesses of the presented example arrays of conventional and ellipsoidal omega particles are @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "however , one can use any other particle which has omega coupling to realize the required polarizabilities in much smaller volumes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the thin focusing layer presented in @xcite actually has the appropriate symmetry of the omega - type bi - anisotropic layer , although without theoretical optimization and with high losses in metal shows only moderate reflectivity .",
    "here , we have introduced the concept of the metamirror which offers a possibility for full control over the reflection phases of its two surfaces .",
    "we have assumed that the metamirror thickness is ultimately small , only allowing one layer of dipolar particles to fit inside the structure .",
    "the investigation of the necessary polarization properties of the unit cells of the structure has shown that reciprocal and lossless bi - anisotropic particles with omega magnetoelectric coupling are the appropriate building blocks for the most general metamirrors .",
    "the study has also revealed the bi - anisotropic nature of the electromagnetic response of conventional high - impedance surfaces in form of mushroom layers ( these layers provide the reflection coefficients equal to @xmath100 and @xmath101 when illuminated from the opposite sides  a very special case of the general metamirror response ) . the bi - anisotropic coupling required for the metamirror operation",
