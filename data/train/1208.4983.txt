    "it is common knowledge that the scalar potential @xmath3 of any charge distribution @xmath4 can be calculated ( using the gaussian absolute system of units ) by the relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter 2 ) @xmath5    in the spherical coordinate system @xmath6 the @xmath3 potential can be conveniently found in many cases by expansion in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the potential at a point is a sum of actions of all the charges involved .",
    "therefore , if we are interested in the potential at a point inside a charge distribution , we will have to split the region of integration in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) into two parts by a sphere of radius @xmath8 centered at the pole @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", we come to equalities of two types , for @xmath10 and for @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath8 refers to the point with the potential we are interested in , and @xmath12 is the point over which integration will be performed .",
    "accordingly , the part of the potential formed by charges with coordinates @xmath13 we shall denote with @xmath14 , and the other part , produced by charges with coordinates @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath16 written in the form appropriate for us here can be found , for instance , in @xcite and are reproduced below :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a multipole moment of order @xmath19 :    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 :    @xmath23    the functions @xmath18 and @xmath22 depend on @xmath8 on the upper and lower limits of integration as on a parameter .",
    "the potential at a given point @xmath24 is a sum of the potentials calculated for @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath25 .    the spherical functions @xmath7 can be written as ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath26    in this expression , the integers @xmath27 satisfy the conditions @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath0 denotes here the associated legendre polynomial .",
    "the vector potential @xmath34 of any current distribution @xmath35 in vacuum can be calculated from the relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter 2 )    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the electrodynamic constant .",
    "relation ( [ 7 ] ) resembles in its form equality ( [ 1 ] ) , the difference being that integration is performed here not over the scalar but rather over the vector function @xmath35 .",
    "if one wanted to employ the above method of potential calculation with the use of spherical harmonics , one would have to apply all the calculations to each component separately , with subsequent vector addition of the results thus obtained .",
    "this approach may meet with considerable difficulties .",
    "on the other hand , if the currents have axial symmetry , one can suggest a fairly simple and straightforward method of calculation of the vector potential which reduces essentially to calculating an integral of one scalar function only .",
    "assume a system of currents with a volume density @xmath35 which have axial symmetry .",
    "denote the axis of symmetry of the system with @xmath38 . introduce a spherical coordinate system @xmath6 such that the @xmath39 axis coincides with the symmetry axis @xmath38 .",
    "denote the unit vectors along the @xmath6 axes by @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath41 plane will be called the equatorial plane .",
    "the system being symmetric , the currents do not depend on the @xmath42 coordinate and have only one component along it : @xmath43 .",
    "this means that all @xmath35 are circular currents , and that the vector of any element of the current lies in the plane parallel to the equatorial plane ( we shall call it the @xmath44 plane ) .",
    "the symmetry of the current system suggests that the vector potential @xmath34 is also axially symmetric , i.e. , the magnitude of the vector potential @xmath45 does not depend on coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "but this means that the magnitude of the vector potential @xmath45 can be determined on any plane passing through the symmetry axis @xmath38 .",
    "the simplest way appears to determine the potential on the plane passing through the @xmath38 axis and the coordinate @xmath46 , and it is this what we are going to do .",
    "call this plane the @xmath47 plane .",
    "calculate the vector potential at a point @xmath24 lying on the @xmath47 plane .",
    "the coordinates of this point are @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient for the purpose of this analysis to pass through this point a plane @xmath49 parallel to the equatorial plane .",
    "consider our situation in more detail .",
    "vector potential at a point @xmath24 ( lying on plane @xmath47 ) is produced by currents flowing throughout the space of interest here .",
    "consider the potentials created by the current elements @xmath50 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates our case .        in fig .",
    "1 , the origin of the spherical system of coordinates is at point @xmath9 , the @xmath38 axis points directly at us , and the dashed line visualizes one of the circular current trajectories .",
    "this trajectory lies in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath44 planes are parallel but do not coincide .",
    "the direction of the @xmath42 axis at point @xmath48 is specified in the figure .",
    "we are looking for the potential at this point .",
    "the @xmath42 axis at point @xmath48 is perpendicular to the @xmath47 plane .",
    "the @xmath8 axis lies in the @xmath47 plane .    the dashed line @xmath51 on the @xmath44 plane is perpendicular to plane @xmath47 , i.e. , parallel to the @xmath42 axis at point @xmath48 .",
    "figure 1 shows two elements of the circular current with densities @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the current element @xmath52 produces at point @xmath48 on plane @xmath47 the potential @xmath54 . as seen from vector equality ( [ 7 ] ) , this potential is directed in space in the same way as the current element @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the angles between a direction in space ( for instance , straight lines perpendicular to plane @xmath47 ) and vectors @xmath52 and @xmath55 should be equal ( in fig .",
    "1 , these are the @xmath56 angles ) .",
    "the vector of the current element @xmath52 is confined to plane @xmath44 , which is parallel to the equatorial plane . as seen from expression ( [ 7 ] ) , this means that the element of the vector potential @xmath55 generated by the current element @xmath52 should likewise lie fully in the plane parallel to the equatorial plane , i.e. , in plane @xmath49 ( the @xmath49 and @xmath44 planes do not coincide ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath55 potential can be resolved into two components , @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "these components are shown in fig . 1 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where the angle @xmath56 is the coordinate of the current element @xmath52 .",
    "since , however , the current is axially symmetric , there will always be an element of current @xmath61 equal in magnitude to the element @xmath62 and located at the same distance from point @xmath48 as the @xmath62 element .",
    "the coordinates of this current element are @xmath63 .",
    "it produces at the same point @xmath48 the potential @xmath64 . resolving potential @xmath64 in the @xmath49 plane into two components , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , we see immediately that the components @xmath57 and @xmath65 cancel , while @xmath58 and @xmath66 add ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . thus , after integration over all elements of current @xmath50 the potential @xmath34 will have only one component , the one along the @xmath42 axis , left . but",
    "this implies that in determination of the @xmath34 potential one may , rather than taking into account the whole potential @xmath67 produced by the current element @xmath50 , restrict oneself to the projection @xmath68 of this potential onto the @xmath42 axis : @xmath69 , where @xmath56 is the coordinate of the element of current @xmath50 .",
    "said otherwise , the potential @xmath68 is generated not by the current element @xmath50 as a whole but by the projection of this element on the line @xmath51 parallel to vector @xmath42 at point @xmath48 .",
    "we can now , on replacing vector @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) with a scalar @xmath70 , calculate the magnitude of the vector potential    @xmath71    the potential at any point @xmath24 can now be written as    @xmath72    because expression ( [ 8 ] ) contains scalar quantities , in calculation of the integral one may resort to expanding the integrand in spherical harmonics .",
    "note , however , that because expression ( [ 8 ] ) contains @xmath73 as a factor , one may conveniently use in expressions for @xmath7 in place of exponential functions employed customarily , trigonometric ones ( see .",
    "e.g. , @xcite , chapter 21 ) . in this case",
    "one will have to replace expression ( [ 6 ] ) with the following relations :    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76 this involves a minor change in the form of expansion of the function .    for @xmath10 :",
    "@xmath77    where the multipole moments @xmath78 and @xmath79 have the form    @xmath80    @xmath81    for @xmath11 :    @xmath82    with the multipole moments @xmath83 and @xmath84    @xmath85    @xmath86    the function @xmath73 entering the expression for @xmath87 also belongs to the system of functions @xmath88 ( see expression ( [ 10 ] ) ) . therefore , because of the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 being orthogonal , part of the multipole moments will vanish in the course of integration of expressions ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) , ( [ 17 ] ) ( orthogonality in index @xmath1 ) .",
    "the only terms left will be those with @xmath2 , i.e. , the terms @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as a result , the double series ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) will become single series and look as    @xmath93    @xmath94    the next step appears to be substitution in these series of the expression for @xmath95 from formula ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "we have to remember , however , that we are looking for the potential on the @xmath46 plane only .",
    "for all other values of the @xmath42 coordinate , the relations we have derived will yield wrong values of the potential .",
    "therefore , prior to substituting the expression for @xmath95 from relation ( [ 10 ] ) , we will have to zero the coordinate @xmath42 .",
    "we obtain naturally @xmath96 .",
    "now the potentials take on the form    @xmath97    where the multipole moments @xmath98 are    @xmath99    @xmath100    with the multipole moments @xmath101    @xmath102    in these formulas , @xmath103 is the circular current density , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the parts of the multipole moments left after integration over the @xmath42 coordinate ( truncated multipole moments ) .",
    "the vector potential at any point in space can be written as    @xmath106 \\mathbf{n}_\\varphi,\\ ] ]    whence we finally come to    this is the final expression for the vector potential @xmath34 . as evident from eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) , vector potential @xmath34 has only one component , @xmath107 .",
    "now we impose an additional constraint , namely , that the currents are symmetrical with respect to the equatorial plane ( which quite often is the case ) . in this case ,",
    "expression ( [ 25 ] ) may contain only functions @xmath108 symmetric about the equator , i.e. , @xmath109 functions .",
    "now expression ( [ 25 ] ) for the vector potential has to be replaced by    @xmath110    it may be of interest to consider a particular relevant case .",
    "consider axially symmetric currents with a @xmath111 dependence on the @xmath112 angle .",
    "this case becomes realized , for instance , if the currents are generated by rotation of charges , with all the charges in a layer of thickness @xmath113 distributed uniformly over the angle @xmath112 and rotating with the same angular velocity .",
    "the @xmath111 function belongs to the system of associated legendre functions .",
    "therefore , the @xmath108 functions being orthogonal with respect to index @xmath114 , the larger part of the terms in the @xmath104 and @xmath105 expansions ( see expressions ( [ 21 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) ) will vanish in calculation , with only @xmath115 and @xmath116 terms with index @xmath117 retained . in this case , the potential will come out as a sum of two terms only :    @xmath118",
    "magnetic field @xmath119 can be calculated with the general expression @xmath120 .",
    "the vector potential of axially symmetric currents has only one component , @xmath107 : @xmath121 . with this in mind , and using the general expression for @xmath122 in the spherical coordinate system (",
    "see , for instance , @xcite , chapter 6 )    @xmath123\\mathbf{n}_r+\\ ] ] @xmath124 \\mathbf{n}_\\vartheta+ \\left[\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(ra_\\vartheta)}{\\partial r}-\\frac{1}{r } \\frac{\\partial a_r}{\\partial\\vartheta}\\right]\\mathbf{n}_\\varphi,\\ ] ] we finally come to                      if the currents are symmetric about the equator , expression ( [ 30 ] ) , similar to formula ( [ 26 ] ) , will contain only equatorially symmetric functions @xmath109 , and summation over @xmath132 should be performed from @xmath133 to @xmath134 .        to illustrate the use of this expression ,",
    "consider the following simple problem : rotation of a charged sphere about one of the diameters .",
