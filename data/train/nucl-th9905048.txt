    "owing to the radioactive nuclear beams , the data of unstable nuclei are increasing rapidly . recently",
    "the structure of excited states as well as the ground states are very attractive in the study of unstable nuclei . in the light nuclear region ,",
    "one of the hot and important subjects has been the clustering features .",
    "the clustering structures of the ground states are already well known to be developed in some light ordinary nuclei such as @xmath4li , @xmath5be and @xmath6ne . in the studies of the light unstable nuclei @xcite the clustering structures",
    "were predicted also in the very neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "it is natural that various molecule - like states may appear in the excited states of light unstable nuclei because the excitation due to relative motion between clusters is important in the light nuclear region .",
    "the clustering structure must be one of the important aspects to understand the exotic features of the unstable nuclei .",
    "however there remain many mysterious problems of clustering development and the role of valence nucleons in the unstable nuclei .",
    "our aim is to make systematic study of structure change with the increase of the excitation energy .",
    "we are to find new features of unstable nuclei such as exotic shapes and molecule - like structures in the excited states and to understand the mechanism of the various structures .",

    "@xcite let us know the strength of the gamow - teller transitions to the excited states of @xmath0be .",
    "these new data of @xmath3 transition strength which are deduced from the cross sections at the forward angle are very helpful to study the structure of the excited states .    in",
    "the theoretical researches on the structure of the ground states of be isotopes such as the reference @xcite , it was found that the developed @xmath9 clustering structure in @xmath5be weakens in the @xmath0be because of the excess two neutrons . as for the excited states of @xmath0be , the previous calculations @xcite with a simplest version ( variation after parity projection ) of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) @xcite predicted that the largely deformed states with the @xmath9+@xmath10 clustering structure construct a rotational band @xmath11 in low energy region which is supported by the experimental energy levels .",
    "the problem of the abnormal spin parity @xmath12 in the ground state of @xmath13be is considered to have a close relation with the deformed non - normal parity states of @xmath0be . in the simple shell model consideration",
    "the normal parity of @xmath13be is negative because of the valence neutron in the @xmath14 shell , however , the ground states is known to be @xmath15 .",
    "it is suggested that one of the reasons for the parity inversion in @xmath13be is the energy gain of the @xmath16 mixing orbit in the prolately deformed system due to the developed clustering .",
    "the @xmath16 orbit of neutrons in neutron - rich be isotopes is interesting and essential to understand the structure of light neutron - rich nuclei and is easily connected with the deformed structure of the non - normal parity states of @xmath0be .",
    "furthermore it is natural that the negative parity band due to the deformed states of @xmath0be makes us imagine a corresponding positive parity band constructed by the analogous deformed intrinsic state where the neutrons in the @xmath16 orbit play important roles .",
    "recently w. von oertzen proposed a dimer model @xcite to describe the excited states of be and b isotopes systematically .",
    "in his idea he supposed @xmath9 clusters and surrounding nucleons in molecular orbits like @xmath17 and @xmath18 bonds as the orbits of electrons in the molecule .",
    "the neutron - rich be nuclei can be written by @xmath9 and neutrons which occupy the molecule - like @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbits .",
    "this idea is helpful to understand the level structure of many excited states of @xmath19be and @xmath0be and to study the mechanism of the deformation of be isotopes .",

    "studied be isotopes by microscopic calculations with the simplest version of amd under a constraint on the deformation parameter @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the single - particle orbits of the valence neutrons and found the importance of molecular orbits .",
    "it was found that in the negative parity state of @xmath0be the main component of the valence neutrons is the positive parity orbit which seems to be the @xmath17 orbit in terms of the dimer model .",
    "they tried to represent the excited @xmath20 state of @xmath0be by constructing 2p-2h states using the wave function of the negative parity state which is considered to be 1p-1h state . comparing the optimum deformation parameters for three states @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath20",
    ", they found that the intrinsic deformation is larger in @xmath22 than @xmath21 and largest in @xmath20 .",
    "the results is consistent with the ones predicted by w. von oertzen .",
    "they calculated excited states @xmath20 of @xmath0be without assuming any cluster cores for the first time and confirmed that the @xmath9 cluster cores may exist in the excited states .",
    "however since the total - angular - momentum projection was not done microscopically , the discussion did nt go beyond the intrinsic system and it is not easy to study other excited states .",
    "they have not mentioned the data such as @xmath23 and @xmath3 transitions which are important in the study of excited states .",
    "@xmath0be has been studied with other microscopic models such as multi cluster models @xcite , amd+gcm(generator coordinate method ) @xcite and the parity - projected hartree - fock(hf ) calculations @xcite . in the former two method",
    "the existence of @xmath24 clusters was assumed . in the last work with parity - projected hf calculations they assumed the excited @xmath20 state as a 2p-2h state by choosing the positive parity eigen state for the valence two neutrons . in the work with hf calculations ,",
    "the analysis was limited in the intrinsic system and it is not easy to study the higher excited states .    our aim is to make systematic studies on the structure of many excited states of the light unstable nuclei with a microscopic model which is free from such assumptions as the inert cores , the existence of clusters , and the particle - hole configurations . for this aim",
    "we adopt a method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics(amd ) .",
    "amd has been already proved to be a very useful theoretical approach for the structure of the light nuclei @xcite . in the amd framework basis wave functions of the system",
    "are written by slater determinants where the spatial part of each single - particle wave function is a gaussian wave packet . in the previous works on the structure of li ,",
    "be and b isotopes @xcite , we applied the simplest version of amd in which the energy variation is done after the parity projection but before the total - angular momentum projection .",
    "it was found that the structure of the ground state changes rapidly between the shell - model - like structure and the clustering structure as the neutron number increases up to the neutron - drip line .",
    "the amd calculations succeeded to reproduce well the experimental data for electro - magnetic properties such as the magnetic dipole moments and the electric quadrupole moments .",
    "it owes to the flexibility of the amd wave function which can represent the clustering structures of light unstable nuclei without assuming any inert cores and clusters .    in the present paper , we study the structure of the excited states of @xmath0be by performing variational calculations after the spin parity projection with finite - range interactions in the framework of amd . for higher states , amd wave functions",
    "are superposed so as to be orthogonal to the lower states .",
    "the amd approach of the variation after spin parity projection(vap ) has been already found to be advantageous for the study of excited states of the light nuclei and be very useful to describe various molecule - like structures @xcite .",
    "we do not rely on any assumptions such as the inert cores , the single - particle orbits in the mean field , and the existence of clusters . by microscopic calculations of the expectation values of the corresponding operators , we can acquire the theoretical values of @xmath25 and @xmath3 transitions which are the valuable informations of the excited states to be compared directly with the experimental data .    in sec .",

    "the total wave function can be superposition of independent amd wave functions . in order to construct higher excited states we consider superposition of the spin parity projected amd wave functions @xmath44 , @xmath45 the detail",
    "is mentioned later in subsection [ subsec : excited ] .",
    "we make variational calculations to find the state which minimizes the energy of the system ; @xmath46 by the method of frictional cooling . regarding the frictional cooling method in amd , the reader is referred to papers @xcite .",

    "it is easily proved that the energy of the system decreases with time . after sufficient time steps of cooling , the parameters for the wave function of minimum - energy state",
