    "this fact leads to the field interference pattern easily seen in fig .",
    "[ field1 ] . for the `` resonance frequency '' the largest period of the pattern",
    "is given by the following simple expression : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the real parts of the propagation constants of the long - period modes 2 and 3 of the complete system , and could be found from the dispersion relation .",
    "in this particular instance @xmath107 .",
    "the small features in the pattern are due to interference of the short - period mode 1 with the long - period modes 2 and 3 . that is , corresponding characteristic length of the pattern is @xmath108 , cf .",

    "these features are in excellent agreement with the results of the recent experimental work @xcite , where authors consider similar geometry and discuss the coupling length and energy exchange between waveguide and spp modes .        at the input of the system main part of the energy was in the dielectric waveguide and then is gradually transferred to the metal film .",
    "it is seen that the beat half - period @xmath109 gives us a characteristic length for energy exchange between the core- and the high - frequency metal film - localized mode ( coupling length ) and at the distance @xmath110 the maximal transfer of the energy into the metal - film - localized mode occurs , see fig .",
    "[ field1 ] .",
    "consequently , low transmission coefficients ( corresponding to almost total energy transfer from waveguide to the spp ) can be achieved by choosing the metal film length of the order @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ tomega2a ] .",
    "this distance is defined as a minimal length of the metal film that can provide for the total energy transfer from the waveguide core to the metal .",
    "since the process of the energy transfer from the core to the spp and in the backward direction in the absence of losses is cyclic , there exist a number of metal film lengths for which the energy total vanishing in the core appears : @xmath112 ; @xmath113 . however , the minimal metal film length has advantage of a large contrast between resonant and non - resonant transmission ( transmission at resonant and non - resonant frequencies ) due to the small dissipation losses in the shorter metal film .",
    "additionally , the spp propagation length in our geometry at the resonance frequency is about 100 @xmath114 m , that is longer than the minimal length of the metal film . in other words",
    "we propose here to make a spr sensing device , that is shorter ( comparable ) than spp propagation length , in contrast to the commonly studied devices with metal film that is much longer than spp propagation length @xcite .",
    "we anticipate that devices with such a minimal length might also have enhanced sensitivity . in the recent work",
    "@xcite it was observed that with decrease in sensing region length , the sensitivity , signal - to - noise ratio are both increasing and the resolution also improves .",
    "however , analysis of the sensitivity and signal - to - noise ratio issues for the devices with minimal sensing region length proposed here are beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "we stress that it is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ tomega2a ] that the effect is even more pronounced as compared with the long - film system .",
    "indeed , the transmittance is about zero at the resonance frequency for the dashed curve corresponding to the metal film length of @xmath115 .",
    "this means , in particular , that there is no need to make a millimeter - long @xcite film in order to observe strong transmittance suppression due to the spr resonance .",
    "this feature might be of a particular interest for device miniaturization and integration .",

    "direct numeric simulation.,width=491 ]    the distribution of the squared magnetic field is depicted .",
    "it is simulated at the resonance frequency for the system with the metal film of the length @xmath116 .",
    "it is seen that , indeed , near the metal film end the energy flux is concentrated close to the film , demonstrating approximately a total energy transfer from the core into the spp mode and consecutive scattering out of the system at the metal film edge . as a result , the energy flux in the cross - section @xmath117  @xmath114 m is practically disintegrated .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss briefly the possibility to apply approximate approach that can be used when a direct numerical modeling becomes time consuming .",
    "the fields evolution and transmittance through the structure can be approximately found using the well - known mode expansion method @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that there exist rather advanced theoretical methods for analysis of the excitation of surface plasma waves in integrated - optical waveguide structures @xcite , however , in our geometry it appears to be sufficient to apply a more simple and straightforward mode expansion approach in the following realization .",
    "note that in the considered configurations the homogeneity of the multi - layer structure along the @xmath31-axis is preserved ( e.g. no gratings are used ) , there will be no energy transfer ( energy exchange ) between the eigenmodes of the complete structure during the propagation .",
    "therefore , it is possible to express any arbitrary incoming field distribution  the fundamental waveguide mode of the dielectric waveguide @xmath118 in our example  at the point @xmath95 in the basis of the eigenmodes of the complete system , @xmath119 , see fig .",
    "[ fullmodes ] . in other words , we calculate what energy each mode would carry through the structure . applying this expansion we obtain the field evolution in an arbitrary point @xmath31 along the structure : @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the eigenmodes of the complete system , @xmath122 is the input fundamental waveguide mode of the dielectric waveguide , @xmath123 are the wavevectors of the eigenmodes of the complete system . using eq .",
    "it is easy to calculate the transmittance through the structure , fig .",

    "we have examined the properties of a multi - layer hybrid device combining the waveguide and surface plasmon polariton modes in a planar geometry .",
    "our main focus here was on the analysis of the feasibility to control mode coupling efficiency through the system design rather than via using additionally written gratings .",
    "we have demonstrated that by the proper design of the multi - layer structures it is feasible to achieve substantial reduction in the length of the device .    we have shown that in the considered scheme ( without using additional gratings ) of the spr - based sensors there exists an optimal length of the metal film .",
    "such an optimal length is defined by the characteristic ( coupling ) distance of the energy exchange between the waveguide core and spp mode .",
    "moreover , there is a set of preferable metal film lengths ( sensing region lengths ) , which are multiples of the coupling distance . the minimal sensing region length offers advantage of higher sensitivity and better signal - to - noise ratio and an improved resolution as it was observed in the recent work @xcite .",
    "minimization of the sensing region length also provides a better contrast between resonant and non - resonant transmission ( transmission at resonant and non - resonant frequency ) , due to the small dissipation losses in the shorter metal film . in general , spr sensor with the minimal metal film length utilizes the effect of spp - photon transformation rather then spp dissipation in the metal plate . in other terms",
    "our design analysis provide a guidance where to cut a metal film to make a short sensing device .",
    "the obtained results might be important for miniaturization and integration of a range of nano - optic systems such as e.g. bio- and chemical sensors , frequency - selective polarizers , and other devices .",
    "we have shown that an appropriate choice of the operational ( resonance ) frequency could be derived from a rather simple examination of the intersections of the waveguide and spp dispersion curves resulting in their hybridization .",
    "this opens a way of an efficient excitation of the surface plasmon resonance by the waveguide mode and vice versa . in the situations",
    "when the required operational frequency ( wavelength ) is defined by the external conditions our results can be used as the design rules for a specific multi - layer device to operate at the desirable frequency .",
    "evidently , hybridization  coupling of the waveguide and spp modes occurs not only at a single frequency point , but rather in some spectral interval .",
    "shift of an operational frequency from an optimal value leads to gradual reduction of the efficiency .",
    "our results indicate that a characteristic length of the devices satisfying the resonance conditions ( accompanied by a high level of hybridization ) required for an efficient energy transfer between waveguide and spp modes could be as short as tens of micrometers .",
    "this is quite an important departure from the characteristic millimeter - scale @xcite lengths of conventional devices .",
    "our scheme can be potentially generalized to other geometries , for instance , it can be applied to the cylindrical ( fiber ) geometry . by an appropriate selection of the parameters the operational ( resonance ) frequency",
    "could be shifted into the near infrared region including telecom windows near @xmath124  @xmath125 this can be achieved , for instance , by increasing the waveguide layer thickness up to @xmath126 and simultaneous decrease of the metal layer thickness down to @xmath127  nm .",
    "the minimum transmission of the multi - layer structure considered here depends essentially on the dielectric properties of the media adjacent to the metal film ( the superstrate ) .",
    "therefore , small variations in the refractive index of this medium would result in a strong shift of the transmission dip offering new opportunities and perspectives for the sensor applications .",
