    "in the introduction of his 1916 paper , eugene cook bingham states : `` in the study of plastic flow it has already been shown that most homogeneous solids will flow somewhat after the manner of liquids , if subjected to sufficient pressure .",
    "copper , steel , lead , ice , menthol , glass , and asphalt fall in this class insofar as they may be regarded as homogeneous solids .",
    "but ordinarily plastic substances are not homogeneous solids but suspensions of finely divided solids in fluids , such as paint in oil , lime in water , and especially clay in water .",
    "numerous papers have been devoted to the explanation of this latter type of plasticity . ''",
    "a hundred years later , in spite of an overwhelming number of works on the subject , the details of plastic flow in such amorphous materials as the clay suspensions studied by bingham , nowadays referred to as `` soft glassy materials , '' still resist complete understanding @xcite .",
    "creep , the slow deformation that results from the application of a constant stress on a solidlike material , is a common manifestation of plasticity .",
    "six years before bingham s paper , at the age of 23 , edward neville da costa andrade showed that when stretched under a constant load , some metallic wires deform such that the strain grows with time as a power law of exponent 1/3 @xcite .",
    "this behaviour , known as `` power - law creep , '' has been interpreted in terms of peculiar dislocation motion within the crystalline matrix due to thermally activated processes @xcite or due to dislocation jamming @xcite .",
    "although also observed in a variety of disordered materials including emulsions , microgels and colloidal gels and glasses , the origin of power - law creep remains mostly elusive in such soft amorphous systems @xcite .",
    "when the applied stress is increased above some critical value , creep gives way to fracture or to viscous flow depending on the material microstructure . in his 1916 paper ,",
    "bingham focused on `` english china clay . '' using a capillary viscometer , he showed that this colloidal dispersion was well described by the following affine constitutive relation between the stress @xmath0 and the shear rate @xmath6 : @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the yield stress of the material and @xmath8 is the viscosity of the material when made to flow far above @xmath1 .",
    "ten years later , this empirical relation was generalized by winslow herschel and ronald bulkley to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are known as the consistency index and flow index respectively @xcite .",
    "this relation accounts for shear - thinning above the yield stress and the exponent @xmath11 typically lies between 0.2 and 0.8 @xcite .",
    "the herschel - bulkley ( hb ) constitutive relation was found to account correctly for the behaviour of a wide range of disordered materials such as foams , emulsions and microgels , which were recently coined `` simple yield stress fluids '' by contrast with other soft glassy materials that display more complex rheological behaviour including thixotropy or shear localization @xcite .",
    "an additional well - known feature of glassy systems is their history - dependence .",
    "for instance , when a silica glass is thermally quenched below the glass temperature , it stores stresses that remain trapped within the material .",
    "these `` residual '' or `` internal '' stresses are routinely used to strengthen so - called prestressed glasses in industrial applications .",
    "similarly , soft glassy materials store residual stresses when mechanically quenched from a presheared fluidised state to rest at zero strain or stress @xcite .",
    "the configuration reached by the quenched microstructure is generally metastable and evolves more and more slowly as the system explores more stable configurations .",
    "such a physical aging may subsequently compete with rejuvenation induced by shear @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present contribution is to explore creep in a carbopol dispersion , a system made of acidic cross - linked polymer particles that swell and jam upon neutralization @xcite .",
    "such carbopol `` microgels '' generally nicely follow the hb behaviour and are considered as non - aging , non - thixotropic yield stress materials @xcite .",
    "however , a number of recent results have reported unexpected results for such a simple yield stress fluid , including rheological hysteresis @xcite , transient shear localization @xcite , influence of rest time on stress overshoots upon shear start - up @xcite and influence of confinement on flow properties @xcite . creep below the yield stress has only been scarcely explored in carbopol and previous works focused on the debate about the existence of a true yield stress _ vs _ a newtonian plateau at low shear rate @xcite .    here",
    ", we focus on a carbopol etd  2050 dispersion whose preparation , microstructure and basic rheological features are discussed in section  [ sec : material ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents the results of creep experiments performed after preshear followed by a rest time under a zero shear rate in cone - and - plate geometry .",
    "we first show that our microgels display robust power - law creep with an exponent @xmath3 for stresses ranging from the yield stress @xmath1 down to a typical value @xmath4 . for applied",
    "shear stresses lower than @xmath5 , the microgels experience a more complex creep behaviour , characterized by an initial decrease of the strain .",
    "we attribute this anomalous creep to residual stresses of the order of @xmath5 that slowly relax after quenching the system from a presheared fluidised state and that compete with the applied stress .",
    "this behaviour appears to be independent of the carbopol concentration ( appendix  b ) but is no longer observed if one prevents residual stresses by imposing a zero shear stress during the rest time ( appendix  c ) . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , these results are discussed in light of the current literature and compared to previous works on other systems in terms of glassy dynamics and aging phenomena . beside findings",
    "specific to carbopol microgels , we emphasize the relevance of creep studies for a better general understanding of soft glassy materials and for deeper investigations of the subtle interplay between microstructure and deformation below the yield stress .",
    "our samples are made of carbopol etd  2050 following the preparation protocol described in @xcite .",
    "the carbopol powder , a mixture of homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid cross - linked with a polyalkyl polyether , is dissolved in deionized water at 50@xmath12c under magnetic stirring for 30  min .",
    "the carbopol mass fraction is @xmath13  %  wt throughout this paper , except in appendix  b where mass fractions of 0.6  %  wt and 2  %  wt are briefly explored .",
    "after equilibration at room temperature for 30  min , the acid solution is neutralized by addition of sodium hydroxyde ( naoh at 0.1  m ) until the ph reaches a value of @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to a dilution of the carbopol solution by about 10  % so that the final carbopol mass fraction is close to 0.9  %  wt .",
    "neutralization induces the swelling and jamming of polymer particles @xcite .",
    "the sample is subsequently homogenized for 24  h by stirring with a mixer ( rw20 , ika , tip : r1303 ) at 2000  rpm .",
    "finally , the sample is centrifuged for 10  min at 3200  rpm in order to remove air bubbles .",
    "the microstructure of carbopol etd  2050 dispersions has been characterized by dynamic light scattering and confocal imaging @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these systems can be considered as a dense , amorphous assembly of soft jammed particles made of swollen polymers , namely as a `` microgel '' following a widespread yet rather loose definition @xcite .",
    "the typical size of the particles is about @xmath15 m as estimated from confocal microscopy on the same system as that investigated here @xcite .",
    "such a length scale is consistent with light scattering measurements performed on samples made of the same carbopol and prepared in similar conditions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xcite report the existence of two different length scales , which points to a heterogeneous structure where regions of higher- and lower- than - average cross - link density coexist .",
    "this suggests that carbopol etd  2050 consists of randomly cross - linked polymers rather than polymer particles with heavily cross - linked cores and dangling free ends .    as a result of the percolation of the network of swollen polymer particles ,",
    "carbopol dispersions typically show a yield stress for weight concentrations as low as 0.06  % @xcite . for concentrations larger than typically 0.2  %  wt , rheological measurements suggest that the system can be described as a `` space - filling paste of swollen microgel particles '' @xcite . as shown in appendix  a ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flowcurve ] ) , the flow curve of our carbopol etd  2050 microgel for @xmath13  %  wt nicely follows hb rheology , @xmath16 , with parameters @xmath17  pa , @xmath18 and @xmath19  pa.s@xmath20 that are fully consistent with those reported on the same system with similar preparation protocols @xcite .",
    "the large extent of the linear regime up to about one strain unit , the low - frequency values of the viscoelastic moduli @xmath21  pa @xmath22  pa and their weak increase with frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oscill ] in appendix  a ) are also in line with previous measurements available in the carbopol literature @xcite .",
    "these various rheological features are characteristic of `` soft glassy materials '' @xcite .",
    "although one should keep in mind that there is no universality among these systems due to the huge variety of microstructures , this `` simple '' yield stress rheology makes carbopol microgels good candidates for generic studies of creep phenomena .",
    "all the experiments reported here were performed with a stress - imposed rheometer ( anton paar mcr 301 ) equipped with a cone - and - plate geometry of diameter 40  mm and angle @xmath23 . to minimize wall slip , we used a sand - blasted cone ( cp40 - 2/s ) with a roughness of 5.5  @xmath24 m .",
    "the bottom plate includes a peltier element that keeps the temperature fixed to 25@xmath12c .",
    "a specific cover is used to limit evaporation and allows us to work on the same sample loading for at most @xmath25  h.    in sect .",
    "[ sec : creep ] below , we perform creep experiments by monitoring the strain response @xmath26 to a constant shear stress @xmath0 . as in most soft glassy materials ,",
    "a good control of the initial state of the microgel sample is crucial to warrant reproducibility and to ensure proper analysis of the experimental data .",
    "therefore , prior to any experiment ( including the previous viscoelastic measurements ) , the freshly loaded sample is first thoroughly fluidised thanks to a strong preshear under a controlled shear rate @xmath27 for a duration @xmath28 . the sample is then allowed to rest under a zero shear rate during a waiting time @xmath29 .",
    "such a protocol allows us to start subsequent tests in a reproducible initial state .",
    "we note that it slightly differs from usual creep protocols performed from a rest period under a zero shear stress @xcite .",
    "experiments performed by imposing a zero shear stress rather than a zero shear rate during the rest time are briefly presented in appendix  c. we check for reproducibility ( and for lack of evaporation or other long - term degradation of the sample ) by systematically measuring the viscoelastic moduli during the rest time under small - amplitude oscillatory shear ( strain amplitude 1  % and frequency 1  hz ) .",
    "the variation in @xmath30 from one experiment to the other over the same loading is found to be less than 1  % .    unless otherwise specified , we use @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 as default parameters for the preshear and rest protocol . the creep test is started immediately after the rest time and the strain @xmath26 is monitored for at least 300  s and up to one hour .",
    "thus , the origin of time @xmath34 is taken here after an `` aging '' duration @xmath29 following preshear .",
    "the influence of @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be addressed in sect .",
    "[ sec : interplay ] .",
    "aging issues , i.e. a possible dependence with @xmath29 , will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : aging ] .",
    "we checked that a constant torque is reached within about 10  ms and that it is kept perfectly constant by the rheometer throughout the creep experiment .",
    "however , inertio - elastic oscillations occur upon application of stress and the material is truly submitted to a constant stress only once these oscillations are damped , typically after a couple of seconds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : creep_fit ] and discussion below ) . after a creep test under a given shear stress @xmath0 ,",
    "the preshear and rest protocol is repeated over again and another creep test is performed for a different value of @xmath0 .",
    "successive values of @xmath0 are chosen in a random order to avoid any artefact arising from a systematic drift in the sample or in the setup .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the elastic modulus at rest differs by more than 10  % from its initial value , indicating evaporation and/or sample alteration , thus requiring to load a new sample . to improve the statistics , creep experiments",
    "are reproduced three to six times for the same shear stress on different loadings of the same microgel preparation batch .    finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : interplay ] , we shall investigate stress relaxation after preshear through flow cessation experiments .",
    "the reason for these additional experiments is that our rheometer does not provide the full temporal stress response under small - amplitude oscillatory strain but only the amplitude of the stress oscillations , so that stress relaxation can not be monitored simultaneously to the viscoelastic moduli .",
    "the preshear protocol for flow cessation experiments is the same as for creep experiments , namely preshear under a controlled shear rate @xmath27 for a duration @xmath28 .",
    "after preshear , a zero shear rate is applied and the stress @xmath35 is monitored over time @xmath34 whose origin is taken immediately after preshear .",
    "figure  [ fig : creep_fit](a ) displays a typical strain response @xmath26 recorded during a creep test under a shear stress @xmath0 well below the yield stress @xmath36  pa but larger than 2  pa .",
    "the short - time response involves damped oscillations [ see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : creep_fit](a ) for @xmath37  s ] that are characteristic of the coupling between the instrument inertia and the material elasticity in stress - controlled rheometry @xcite .",
    "although analyzing such oscillations may provide valuable information @xcite , we shall disregard them in the present work as we focus on the long - term creep behaviour of our microgels . in order to quantify the response to creep ,",
    "we first consider the shear rate @xmath38 obtained by differentiating @xmath26 with respect to time and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : creep_fit](b ) .",
    "as seen by using logarithmic scales , @xmath38 decays as a power law of time , @xmath39 with @xmath40 over almost three decades in time .    based on the value @xmath41 of the exponent extracted from @xmath38",
    ", we then go back to the strain data and fit @xmath26 by a power law : @xmath42 with only two adjustable parameters , namely the initial strain @xmath43 and the prefactor @xmath44 .",
    "such a fit is restricted to times larger than a few seconds in order to exclude short - time oscillations .",
    "the result is shown as a red line in fig .",
    "[ fig : creep_fit](a ) and the inset confirms that @xmath45 grows as a power law of time .",
    "such a power law is strikingly similar to the power - law creep with exponent 1/3 first reported by andrade in metallic wires stretched under a constant load @xcite .",
    "this behaviour , referred to as `` andrade - like '' scaling , will be discussed in more details in sect .",
    "[ sec : andrade ] below .",
    "the initial strain @xmath43 corresponds to the instantaneous , elastic deformation that would be observed in the absence of inertio - elastic oscillations i.e. in an `` ideal '' creep experiment .",
    "the time @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : strain ] ) corresponds to the point where the strain has increased by 100  % starting from @xmath43 .",

    "for creep experiments at @xmath47 , , , , , and from top to bottom ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "the yellow solid lines show the best power - law fits of @xmath48 over the corresponding fitting intervals ( see text ) .",

    "[ fig : creep_regimes ] . while experiments performed above the yield stress @xmath36  pa show a transition from a creep regime to a flowing regime with a non - zero steady - state shear rate ( see dark brown curve for @xmath51  pa ) or at least an upturn in the shear rate ( see curves for @xmath52 and 14  pa ) , creep tests for @xmath50 all decrease to vanishingly small shear rates .",
    "this behaviour is typical of the yielding transition . below the yield stress ,",
    "the system slowly creeps and the shear rate tends towards zero . above the yield stress , the material eventually flows although such a solid - to - fluid transition takes increasingly long times as the applied stress approaches the yield stress .",
    "the creep behaviour of microgels made of carbopol etd  2050 yet with a different preparation protocol has been extensively studied _ above _ the yield stress by divoux _",
    "it was shown that the fluidisation time diverges as a power law of the viscous stress and that the transition towards a flowing state involves a solid  fluid coexistence through the presence of long - lived transient shear bands .",
    "although the goal of the present study is to focus on creep _ below _ the yield stress , we emphasize that an andrade - like scaling was already reported in @xcite with an exponent of about 1/3 and that the creep regime was shown to involve a locally homogeneous deformation field at scales larger than a few tens of micrometers thanks to ultrasonic velocimetry .",
    "the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath43 , extracted from power - law fits of @xmath48 and @xmath26 as described above , are plotted as a function of the imposed stress @xmath0 with black symbols in fig .",

    "the time intervals over which the fits are performed depend on @xmath0 and are indicated by yellow lines in fig .  [ fig : creep_regimes ] .",
    "the exponent @xmath41 is seen to remain roughly constant for @xmath53 and its mean is @xmath54 . for stresses above the yield stress ,",
    "the exponent seems to increase significantly",
    ". this could be due to the fact that for @xmath55 , the amplitude of the initial inertio - elastic oscillations may reach into the nonlinear regime and significantly affect the material , e.g. through microstructural rearrangements .",
    "yet , the fitting interval gets smaller as the creep regime becomes shorter under larger applied stresses , which makes the error bars on @xmath41 increase dramatically .",

    "for @xmath67 however , the two estimates of @xmath41 strongly differ",
    ". this may be due to the fact that for low stresses , differentiating @xmath26 leads to noisy shear rate responses involving negative values of @xmath38 which are not taken into account when fitting the logarithm of the data to a straight line ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : andrade](a ) .",
    "it could be tempting to interpret the low values of @xmath41 obtained by first fitting @xmath38 ( yellow solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_stress1 ] ) as logarithmic creep .",
    "however , fitting @xmath26 with three free parameters over the same time range leads to much larger values of @xmath41 ( gray solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_stress1 ] ) .",
    "this is indicative of a high sensitivity to the fitting procedure and questions the validity of the power - law model .",
    "even more strikingly , at even lower stresses ( @xmath72  pa ) , strain responses no longer show a monotonic increase once the initial oscillations have died out and @xmath26 even goes to negative values for the smallest applied stress of 0.6  pa . as shall be shown in the next section ,",
    "this anomalous behaviour is the signature of a subtle interplay between creep and residual stresses following preshear .            in order to interpret the unusual creep behaviour under low applied stresses",
    ", we now turn to the flow cessation experiments shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual](a ) .",
    "the stress @xmath35 is seen to slowly relax and does not seem to tend to zero at long times .",
    "this indicates that internal stresses remain within the material over long time scales . for obvious practical reasons",
    ", we have to stop the relaxation after a given waiting time @xmath73 , here @xmath74 .",
    "we then define the `` residual stress '' simply as @xmath75 .",
    "this residual stress is of the order of 1  pa and decreases with the preshear rate @xmath27 .",
    "figures  [ fig : residual](b ) and ( c ) show that for a given @xmath27 , @xmath76 is independent of the preshear duration @xmath28 but that it decreases as @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the material only keeps a memory of the preshear intensity ( as long as it has been previously thoroughly fluidised by preshear ) .    as will be discussed in more details below in sect .",
    "[ sec : discuss_residual ] , residual stresses result from the quench from a high shear rate to zero shear rate , which traps the microstructure into a configuration that slowly relaxes over time . here , we note that the values taken by @xmath76 roughly correspond to the stress @xmath5 below which the andrade exponent significantly differs from @xmath54 in figs .",
    "[ fig : andrade](a ) and [ fig : low_stress1 ] .",
    "it is also of the same order of magnitude as the value @xmath61  pa found in fig .  [",
    "fig : andrade](b ) .",
    "therefore , the anomalous creep behaviour observed at low stress most likely arises from an effect of this residual stress .          to confirm the link between anomalous creep and residual stresses , we go back to creep experiments at low imposed stress but we now vary the preshear rate @xmath27 for a fixed @xmath68  pa in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_stress2](a ) .",
    "the strain response is observed to decrease initially only for the lowest preshear rate i.e. for the largest residual stress after the rest period of 300  s following preshear . when the preshear rate is increased such that the corresponding residual stress lies significantly below the applied stress ,",
    "andrade - like creep is recovered .",
    "figures  [ fig : low_stress2](b ) and ( c ) focus on two one - hour long experiments performed on the same loading , respectively a creep test at a very low stress of 0.5  pa and a stress relaxation for the same preshear protocol .",
    "interestingly , the strain @xmath26 in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_stress2](b ) decreases as long as the stress @xmath35 is larger than 0.5  pa in fig .",
    "[ fig : low_stress2](c ) and the time at which @xmath35 reaches 0.5  pa is of the same order of magnitude as the time at which @xmath26 goes through a minimum value of about @xmath78 and starts increasing ( see red dashes ) .",
    "our interpretation of anomalous creep at low stress is thus as follows . when brought to rest at a zero shear rate , the presheared material stores some internal stresses that do not fully relax even on very long time scales . after a waiting time of 300",
    "s , the resulting macroscopic stress @xmath76 is typically about 1  pa .",
    "when a stress @xmath0 is subsequently applied , the material actually `` feels '' an effective stress @xmath79 .",
    "when @xmath80 , this results in a decreasing strain response after the initial elastic deformation .",
    "during such a `` backward creep , '' the strain may then reach negative values . to put it differently , relaxing residual stresses tend to deform the material in the direction opposite to that of preshear .",
    "this is most probably because microstructural deformations induced by preshear in the forward direction are quenched during the rest time at zero shear rate so that releasing the stress ( or applying @xmath80 ) tends to relax the structure in the reverse direction .",
    "as the microstructure slowly relaxes , the applied stress eventually overcomes residual stresses and the strain @xmath26 starts increasing , although this may take very long times . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath81 , the strain increases right from the start of the creep experiment but residual stresses slow down the strain response , leading to the flatter @xmath26 observed for @xmath82  pa .",
    "this competition between structural relaxation and the applied stress leads to the anomalous creep response observed for @xmath83  pa .",
    "long - time behaviours similar to those reported here in figs .",
    "[ fig : low_stress1 ] and [ fig : low_stress2 ] have been observed previously in other microgels under low stresses @xcite and raise the question of aging .",
    "this will be further discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : aging ] .",
    "our main findings concern ( i )  the evidence for robust power laws that characterize the creep behaviour of etd  2050 carbopol microgels below the yield stress @xmath1 and down to @xmath4 and ( ii )  the presence of residual stresses after a rest time under a zero shear rate following preshear .",
    "these residual stresses are of the same order of magnitude as @xmath5 and compete with the applied stress in creep experiments for @xmath69 and that raise the question of long - term relaxation and glassy dynamics . as shown in appendix  b , these findings are robust to a change of carbopol concentration .",
    "moreover , in appendix  c , we test the more classical protocol where a zero shear stress ( rather than a zero shear rate ) is imposed during the rest time .",
    "these additional measurements show that power - law creep is still present and characterized by the same exponent but that anomalous creep is no longer observed at low applied stresses . since this zero - stress protocol cancels out any residual stress , this confirms the interplay between creep and residual stresses when a quench to a zero shear rate is applied following preshear . in this section",
    ", we further discuss our results in light of previous works on soft materials .",
    "power - law creep has been reported in a number of soft systems including cellulose solutions @xcite , aging polymers @xcite , hexagonal columnar phases @xcite , collagen solutions @xcite , carbopol microgels similar to those studied here @xcite , emulsions @xcite , colloidal glasses @xcite , colloidal gels made of attractive carbon black particles @xcite , natural gum @xcite , protein gels @xcite and living cells @xcite . the exponent @xmath41 ranges from 0.2 to 0.7 depending on the system .",
    "therefore , andrade - like creep is ubiquitous in soft matter and the main open question is how it can be interpreted in terms of microstructure .",
    "it appears that the various materials listed above can be broadly divided into two categories .",
    "a first category encompasses biological and/or fibrous - like materials such as living cells , protein , collagen or cellulose gels , whose creep eventually leads to irreversible failure .",
    "these materials are generally characterized not only by power - law creep but also by a `` power - law rheology '' in the sense that their linear viscoelastic moduli depend upon frequency as power laws , @xmath84 , with the same exponent as the strain in creep experiments .",
    "power - law rheology is generally understood as deriving from the fractal nature of the underlying microstructural network @xcite .",
    "since the viscoelastic spectrum and the creep compliance are related through a laplace transform , the link between power - law rheology and power - law creep is straightforward at least in the small deformation regime @xcite .",
    "interestingly , based on scott - blair s fractional approach and material `` quasiproperties '' @xcite , such a link can be extended to more complex linear rheologies and even to nonlinear viscoelasticity @xcite .",
    "moreover , power - law creep , as well as the critical behaviour of some protein gels approaching failure @xcite , is well captured by a family of models known as `` fiber - bundle models '' ( fbms ) @xcite that were originally devised for solid fibrous materials such as fiber - matrix composites @xcite .",
    "however , so far , some important assumptions of fbms , such as local _ vs _ global load sharing @xcite or damage accumulation @xcite by the `` fibers '' that constitute the microstructure , have not been evidenced experimentally in real soft systems .",
    "the second category , which is more relevant to the present work , gathers a number of `` soft glassy materials '' that are characterized by an amorphous microstructure made of a dense assembly of particles .",
    "these materials include hexagonal columnar phases , colloidal glasses , emulsions and carbopol microgels .",
    "they generically show an almost frequency - independent elastic modulus so that there is not such an obvious link between their linear viscoelasticity and power - law creep as for the previous class of materials .",
    "rather , the origin of power - law creep in soft glassy materials and its relation to their structural properties remain to be fully unveiled . in particular",
    ", a recent single - mode reduction of mode - coupling theory ( mct ) generalized to transient regimes suggests that under certain conditions and in the low - frequency range , the elastic modulus is essentially frequency - independent and the viscous modulus scales as @xmath85 where @xmath41 corresponds to the andrade exponent @xcite . here , we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : oscill](a ) that @xmath86 so that this exponent is indeed compatible with the andrade exponent .",
    "clearly , more systematic work is required to decide whether this is mere coincidence or whether there is a fundamental connection between the frequency - dependence of the viscous modulus and power - law creep in soft glassy materials .",
    "let us also point out that a recent model of an elasto - plastic material with kinematic hardening predicts power - law creep where the andrade exponent @xmath41 is linked to the herschel - bulkley exponent @xmath11 through @xmath87 for @xmath50 and @xmath88 for @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , with @xmath90 , this corresponds to negative values of @xmath41 i.e. to decreasing strains inconsistent with the andrade - like creep observed experimentally .    by analogy with",
    "the motion of dislocations and vacancies that gives rise to andrade creep in crystalline solids @xcite , it has been speculated that power - law creep arises from collective particle dynamics within the dense , disordered microstructure . a phenomenological model based on this idea and introducing a time - dependent fraction of mobile and arrested particles correctly predicts the andrade exponent @xmath91 observed in emulsions from the scaling of the steady - state flow curve with the volume fraction @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for such heterogeneous dynamics under creep came only very recently from both simulations and experiments on hard - sphere colloidal glasses @xcite . using simultaneous rheology and confocal microscopy , sentjabrskaja _ et al .",
    "_ could make a quantitative link between the strain response @xmath26 and dynamical heterogeneities that remain spatially localized and sub - diffusive during creep but grow in size and become transiently super - diffusive at the onset of steady flow .",
    "in particular , they showed that the mean squared displacement @xmath92 follows the same power law as the strain , @xmath93 , with @xmath91 for @xmath94 in simulations and @xmath95 for @xmath96 in experiments .",
    "although applied stresses smaller than the yield stress were not investigated experimentally , probably due to the very small value of @xmath36  mpa , this study provides promising key results on microscopic dynamics during the creep of colloidal glasses .",
    "interestingly , simulations show that dynamical heterogeneities may arrange into macroscopic shear bands during power - law creep @xcite while local measurements yet on rather large spatial scales have suggested that the deformation remains homogeneous @xcite .",
    "this obviously deserves more work and confocal microscopy appears as an excellent tool to address this issue .",
    "of course the present measurements , which are restricted to global rheological data , do not provide any insight into local dynamics . however , we note that the andrade exponent takes very similar values in carbopol , emulsions and colloidal glasses .",
    "our results also show that power - law creep is observed below the yield stress down to very small applied stresses .",
    "we believe that microscopy experiments coupled to rheology are in line to fully understand creep in carbopol microgels where the above picture of mobile _ vs _ arrested particles is likely to fail since the microstructure is constituted of swollen polymer particles that are compressed and deformed against each other .      over the last few years , interest into residual stresses in soft materials has grown spectacularly .",
    "it is acknowledged that residual stresses ( also sometimes referred to as `` internal '' stresses ) result from history - dependent microstructural features that are frozen - in upon cessation of shear and generally decrease with the preshear rate or stress .",
    "recent studies include polyelectrolyte microgels @xcite , colloidal gels @xcite as well as colloidal glasses @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of random jammed assemblies of non - brownian elastic spheres have shown that residual stresses can be attributed to quenched angular distortions of the microstructure that slowly relax over time @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , in carbopol microgels , residual stresses have only been mentioned by a few studies and in the specific contexts of bubble rise @xcite , penetrometry @xcite , capillary rise @xcite and surface tension measurements @xcite . while coussot _",
    "et al . _ have raised the possibility that residual stresses interfere with the creep response at low applied stresses in bentonite , mustard and a hair gel mostly constituted of carbopol @xcite , no quantitative analysis of this phenomenon had been performed as in the present work . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual](c ) for a fixed @xmath28 , the residual stress decreases as a weak power law of @xmath27 with an exponent @xmath97 which seems rather insensitive to the concentration [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : concentration](c ) in appendix  b ] .",
    "interestingly , residual stresses measured from experiments on colloidal glasses and from molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with such a scaling , although power - law fits were not performed by the authors ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it could be argued that the logarithmic scaling evidenced in polyelectrolyte microgels , @xmath98 with @xmath99 the preshear stress @xcite , is actually compatible with the present weak power law of @xmath27 .",
    "andrade - like creep and/or residual stresses are commonly predicted from various non - ergodic models for glassy behaviour , including the `` soft glassy rheology '' ( sgr ) model derived from local probabilistic descriptions @xcite , the `` shear transformation zone '' ( stz ) theory @xcite , mct @xcite and more phenomenological approaches @xcite .",
    "there , the progressive slowing down of the shear rate observed under creep is attributed to aging , i.e. to the fact that the system explores deeper and deeper potential wells in the complex energy landscape that results from the wealth of ever - evolving configurations accessible to the glassy system . in the case of step - strain response , aging can be defined as `` the property that a significant part of the stress relaxation takes place on time scales that grow with the age @xmath73 of the system '' @xcite .",
    "these observations obviously question the possible implication of aging in the interplay between creep and residual stresses observed in our experiments . as a matter of fact , decreasing strain responses under small applied stresses have been reported in polyelectrolyte microgels @xcite .",
    "together with logarithmic strain recovery curves after flow cessation , these peculiar creep responses have been interpreted in terms of aging phenomena .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath26 curves measured under a stress @xmath100 first increase and then keep decreasing logarithmically over the course of several hours without any sign of levelling off .",
    "the time at which @xmath26 starts to decrease was shown to correspond to the `` age '' of the system , defined as the waiting time @xmath73 at rest between preshear and the creep measurement , so that all strain responses under low stresses can be collapsed by plotting @xmath101 as function of @xmath102 .",
    "similar results were later reported in thermosensitive pnipam microgels for @xmath103 @xcite and successfully modeled with an stz theory @xcite .",
    "such a striking behaviour , characterized by a response in the direction opposite to the preshear flow , was ascribed to structural relaxation and strong aging effects : after a rest time @xmath73 , configurations with relaxation times faster than @xmath73 have relaxed so that , when a small stress is applied , the strain increases at short times but decreases for @xmath104 as configurations with relaxation times longer than @xmath73 relax . above a typical stress @xmath105 , ever - increasing strain responses",
    "are observed that are still dependent on @xmath73 due to competition between aging and partial rejuvenation .",

    "[ fig : aging](a ) .",
    "as already reported on similar etd  2050 carbopol samples @xcite , we find that the elastic modulus recovers a value of about 40  pa within a few seconds but that it subsequently increases logarithmically with time [ see inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : aging](a ) ] while the viscous modulus concomitantly decreases .",
    "therefore , we observe a slow consolidation , i.e. enhanced elasticity and smaller dissipation over time , that could be interpreted as the signature of some aging process @xcite . however , focusing on strain relaxation after preshear provides a somewhat different picture .",
    "figure  [ fig : aging](b ) indeed shows that following a fast quench from a stress value @xmath110  pa well above the yield stress down to zero stress , the strain @xmath26 does not decrease logarithmically as observed in polyelectrolyte microgels by @xcite .",
    "rather it is well fitted by a sum of three exponentials , which hints at a viscoelastic - like relaxation mechanism .",
    "thus , it appears that our system reaches an equilibrium state within a few minutes in contrast with strongly aging materials ( compare with fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that in the case of thermosensitive pnipam microgels , strain relaxations were not strictly logarithmic and seemed to level off after a few minutes ( see fig .  4 in @xcite )",
    ". this could be indicative of aging effects intermediate between the present study and those in @xcite .        to further test the influence of the `` age '' of the system on its creep behaviour , we performed series of creep experiments with different rest times @xmath73 during which the viscoelastic moduli are monitored through small - amplitude oscillatory shear ( strain amplitude 1  % and frequency 1  hz ) . when the applied stress is well above @xmath5 , we observe power - law",

    "suggests that aging does not have a paramount influence on the creep behaviour of our carbopol samples .",
    "even if we observe long - lasting stress and strain relaxations , these are most likely to be of viscoelastic origin than due to true glassy dynamics .",
    "we have shown that microgels constituted of carbopol etd  2050 display power - law creep with an exponent of about 0.4 whatever the carbopol concentration . additionally , when quenched from a fluidised state to a constant strain , these samples store residual stresses that relax in a viscoelastic - like fashion ( rather than logarithmically as observed in other systems with strong aging effects ) .",
    "these residual stresses result in an anomalous creep behaviour under low shear stresses : for @xmath114 , the strain initially decreases but levels off and eventually increases after a time that depends on the preshear rate , on the rest time @xmath73 and on the applied stress . here , we do not observe strain responses with long - time logarithmic decreasing trends that scale as @xmath73 , which points to the absence of significant aging effects .",
