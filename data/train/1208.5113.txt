    "there are two types of quantum stochastic differential equations , namely , linear and nonlinear .",
    "linear quantum systems can be described by linear quantum stochastic differential equations and arise mostly in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . an important class of linear quantum stochastic models describe the heisenberg evolution of the annihilation and creation operators of several independent open quantum harmonic oscillators that are coupled to external coherent bosonic fields , such as coherent laser beams ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . a special class of these linear quantum systems is driven by quantum wiener processes as in @xcite where physical realizability conditions are developed to determine when the linear quantum system under consideration can be regarded as a representation of a linear quantum harmonic oscillator .",
