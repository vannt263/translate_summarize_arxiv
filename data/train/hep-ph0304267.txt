    "elucidation of the dynamics responsible for the breaking of electroweak symmetry is one of the primary goals in particle physics during this decade . in the current run - ii of the fermilab tevatron , the upgraded collider detector facility ( cdf ) and",
    "d0 detectors will search for the neutral higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) , the vehicle of symmetry breaking in the standard model ( sm ) , as well as the higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the task is challenging . the production cross sections and branching fractions into channels favorable for detection are relatively small , and the backgrounds from competing processes are large  @xcite .",
    "the fully inclusive gluon - gluon fusion subprocess  @xcite @xmath5 supplies the largest cross section at tevatron energies .",
    "its rate is a factor four or so greater than that of the next most important subprocess , associated production @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . in the region of modest higgs boson masses , @xmath8  gev , the combination of gluon fusion production with the dominant decay process @xmath9 should be attractive , but its promise is compromised by the overwhelming production of @xmath10 pairs from strong interactions background processes . for @xmath11  gev , the channel @xmath12 becomes dominant , and gluon fusion followed by @xmath12 provides a potential discovery mode at the tevatron .",
    "calculations of the expected differential cross sections for production of the signal and backgrounds are important for evaluation of the required measurement accuracies and detector performance .",
    "estimations of the expected transverse transverse momentum distributions can suggest selections in this variable that should improve background rejection . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on @xmath5 and discuss the behavior of the higgs boson transverse momentum distribution in the region of small and intermediate values of @xmath0 . we expect our predictions to be directly pertinent in the region @xmath11  gev , but we also entertain optimism that experimenters may find clever ways to make use of the dominant channel @xmath5 in the region @xmath8  gev .    in the gluon fusion process , production occurs through triangle loops of colored ( s)particles that couple to the higgs boson and to gluons . in the sm , the most relevant contribution is from a loop of top ( @xmath13 ) quarks . the coupling of gluons is simplified in the limit of large top quark mass @xmath14  @xcite .",
