    "the hot gas in elliptical galaxies , groups , and clusters of galaxies is thought to be enriched with metals by material ejected by supernovae .",
    "hence , the abundances in the hot gas record the star formation history of these systems and therefore probe the rates of type ia and type ii supernovae as well as the shape of the imf ( for reviews see renzini 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "since the hot gas in these systems emits at temperatures @xmath7-@xmath8 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 - 10 kev ) , x - ray observations are the preferred means to determine the abundances in the hot gas .",
    "spatial analyses of the x - ray surface brightness profiles of groups of galaxies using _ rosat _ @xcite indicate that the hot gas typically extends out to distances in excess of 100 kpc ( e.g. david et al .",
    "1994 ; pildis , bregman , & evrard 1995 ; davis et al . 1996",
    "; ponman et al . 1996 ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & kim 1997 ) and also suggest that the gas is divided into distinct components corresponding to the halo of the central galaxy and an extended component for the surrounding group ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ; also see ikebe et al .",
    "these studies typically obtain average temperatures of @xmath11 - 2 kev from analysis of the _ rosat _ pspc spectra and also find evidence for positive temperature gradients in some groups ( trinchieri et al .",
    "1997 ; mulchaey & zabludoff 1998 ) . despite the evidence for temperature gradients , in most cases the abundances reported by the _",
    "studies are obtained from isothermal spectral models from which very sub - solar fe abundances are inferred ( a notable exception being ngc 533  trinchieri et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "similarly , analyses of the _ asca _ data @xcite of groups which assume isothermal gas typically find very sub - solar fe abundances and , in some cases , si / fe ratios in excess of solar ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; davis , mulchaey , & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "although the point spread function ( psf ) of _ asca _ is quite large and asymmetric , there have been several attempts to deconvolve the _ asca _ data to allow analysis of the spectra as a function of radius with the results for galaxy clusters being decidedly mixed ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "1998 ; kikuchi et al .",
    "recently , finoguenov et al . and finoguenov & ponman have applied their own method of deconvolution to the _ asca _ data of a small number of groups . by assuming the hot gas to be in a single phase",
    ", these authors have fitted isothermal models at several radii for each group .",
    "similar to the previous studies , finoguenov et al . and",
    "finoguenov & ponman obtain very sub - solar fe abundances and si / fe ratios in excess of solar .",
    "the very sub - solar fe abundances for the hot gas in groups of galaxies deduced by these studies are in many cases less than those of galaxy clusters and thus pose a problem for the popular models of chemical enrichment which assume ratios of type ia to type ii supernova and an imf similar to those of the milky way .",
    "( e.g. renzini 1997 ) . to reconcile these observations with these models",
    "it has to be postulated that galaxy groups accrete a significant amount of primordial gas after they have spent most of their evolution expelling gas .",
    "the unattractive features of this scenario are discussed by renzini .",
    "these results for groups are in every way analogous to those initially obtained for ellipticals with _ rosat _",
    "( e.g. davis & white 1996 ) and _ asca _ ( e.g. matsumoto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "recently , however , buote & fabian ( 1998 , hereafter bf ) and buote ( 1999 , hereafter b99 ) have demonstrated that models having at least two temperature components in the hot gas are required to explain the _ asca _ spectra of the brightest ellipticals .",
    "these multiphase models agree with the positive temperature gradients indicated by the _ rosat _",
    "data unlike the isothermal models ( b99 ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly bf and b99 also showed that the fe abundances determined from the multiphase spectral models of the brightest ellipticals are consistent with solar in stark contrast to the very sub - solar values obtained from isothermal models .",
    "this strong dependence of the fe abundance on the spectral model indicates that one can not obtain a reasonable estimate of the fe abundance by using an isothermal model if the hot gas consists of multiple temperature components .",
    "similar problems also arise when determining the @xmath5/fe ratios ( b99 ) .",
    "since the spectral properties of the brightest ellipticals are so similar to groups , it should be expected that similar results for the fe abundance also apply to groups of galaxies . to investigate this issue we selected for analysis the groups from the samples of mulchaey & zabludoff and davis et al .",
    "having the highest quality _ asca _ data suitable for detailed spectral analysis .",
    "in addition , we included the group ngc 1132 since mulchaey & zabludoff argue that it has properties similar to bright groups despite the fact that it has no large galaxies aside from ngc 1132 .",
    "our final sample consists of 12 galaxies whose properties are listed in table [ tab.prop ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ obs ]",
    "we present the observations and discuss the data reduction .",
    "we define the models used for broad - band spectral fitting in section [ models ] and discuss calibration and fitting issues in section [ issues ] .",
    "the results for the broad - band spectral fitting analysis are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in section [ disc ] and present our conclusions in section [ conc ] .",
    "finally , in appendix [ bias ] we use simulated _ asca _ observations to examine in detail the `` fe bias '' and `` si bias '' associated with the spectral fitting of ellipticals , groups , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     best - fitting 1 t model parameters resulting from fits to simulated _ asca _ data of the models in table [ tab.models ] .",
    "all elements not listed have abundances tied to fe in their solar ratios",
    ". see text for discussion of the _ asca _ simulations .",
    "the x - ray studies of the hot gas in elliptical galaxies ngc 720 by buote & canizares and ngc 4636 by trinchieri et al .",
    "were the first to show that the _ rosat _ pspc spectra of ellipticals could not distinguish between isothermal models with very sub - solar fe abundances and two - temperature models with solar fe abundances .",
    "using simulated pspc data buote & canizares further demonstrated that if the galaxy spectrum is intrinsically characterized by two temperatures in the hot gas with solar fe abundances but is instead fitted with an isothermal model then sub - solar fe abundances necessarily result ; i.e. the isothermal model gives a strongly biased measurement of the fe abundance kev for the hot gas and @xmath12 kev for a bremsstrahlung component .",
    "although this shows the degeneracies in metallicity depending on the spectral model of a faint ( low @xmath13 ) elliptical , this does not demonstrate a bias resulting from fitting a spectrum with two temperatures in the hot gas ( i.e. with @xmath14 - 2 kev ) apart from any bremsstrahlung component . ] .",
    "the strong dependence of the fe abundance on spectral model has now been demonstrated using _ asca _",
    "data for elliptical galaxies by bf and b99 and for groups of galaxies in this paper .",
    "these papers also show that multiphase models are clearly favored over isothermal models for these systems . as a result",
    ", investigators hoping to obtain average fe abundances for these objects by fitting isothermal models in actuality always infer strongly biased ( i.e. very sub - solar ) fe abundances for ellipticals ( e.g. matsumoto et al .",
    "1997 ) and for groups ( e.g davis et al .",
    "since this `` fe bias '' is crucial for interpreting the x - ray spectra of these systems , in this appendix we attempt to elucidate this bias by using simulations of simple multiphase models that are consistent with the current _ asca _ observations of ellipticals , groups , and clusters .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the fe bias on temperature by considering objects spanning the temperatures of the brightest ellipticals , groups , and clusters of galaxies .",
    "in addition , we use _ asca _ simulations of these systems to show the dependence of the @xmath5/fe ratios on the spectral model .",
    "thus , this appendix updates and extends the brief studies of the fe bias that appear in section 2.2 of buote & canizares and in section 3.2.2 of bf .",
    "the key properties of the four reference models we use for this study are listed in table [ tab.models ] .",
    "each of these models corresponds to regions of positive temperature gradient ( e.g. see section 5 of b99 ) .",
    "models 1 and 2 are based on the two - temperature and cooling flow models of the elliptical galaxy ngc 1399 within @xmath15 kpc ( b99 ) which are also quite similar to the corresponding models of several of the lower - temperature groups in this paper ( see sections [ 2 t ] and [ cf ] ) . to explore the high - temperature groups we base model 3 on the cooling flow models of mkw 9 and ngc 4104 ( section [ cf ] ) .",
    "finally , we obtained the _ asca",
    "_ data of a478 from the heasarc archive and have analyzed the spectra within a @xmath16 radius km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , and @xmath18 . ] in a similar manner to the ellipticals and groups ( see section [ obs ] ) : the result is listed as model 4 and is consistent with previous studies ( e.g. johnstone et al .",
    "a478 was selected because ( 1 ) it is one of the brightest clusters having evidence for substantial excess absorption and ( 2 ) with respect to other cooling flow clusters a comparatively large fraction of the emission measure arises from the cooling flow component ; i.e. a478 should be one of the most favorable clusters for examining systematics when fitting an isothermal model .",
    "we simulated _ asca _ observations of the models in table [ tab.models ] using xspec . because of its better energy resolution and sensitivity near 1 kev we focus on the sis data .",
    "for consistency of presentation we use the same pi grouping for each simulated sis spectrum ( i.e. that of the sis data of ngc 1399  see b99 ) .",
    "our choices of exposure times for the simulations are motivated by a desire to insure ( 1 ) sufficiently high s / n for each case so that noise does not noticeably affect the fitted parameter values , ( 2 ) that the sizes of the residuals ( in terms of @xmath19 ) are similar to the best available _ asca _ data , and ( 3 ) that the simulated data for each model have similar s / n . although background is included in the simulations , the s / n criteria stated above insure that its effect is only noticeable at the highest energies which are not of interest to our study .",
    "in figure [ fig.sim.n1399 ] we plot the simulated _ asca _ sis data of models 1 and 2 from table [ tab.models ] and also show the best - fitting isothermal model and its residuals .",
    "these 1 t models with the @xmath5/fe ratios fixed at solar give best - fitting values of @xmath20 for the simulated 2 t model and @xmath21 for the simulated cf+1 t model .",
    "( these metallicities do not differ significantly from the fe abundances obtained when the @xmath5/fe ratios are allowed to vary in the fits  see table [ tab.1tvar ] . )",
    "notice that both the pattern of residuals and the metallicities derived from the 1 t fits are very similar for both models 1 and 2 and thus the fe bias is essentially the same for isothermal fits to two - temperature and cooling flow spectra .",
    "this fe bias is insensitive to the presence of excess absorption on the colder component .",
    "if instead we consider a model identical to model 1 but with @xmath22 @xmath23 , then the metallicity obtained from fitting the 1 t model to the simulated _ asca _ data has a best - fitting value @xmath24 which is consistent with the value obtained from the simulated model 1 within the @xmath25 errors .",
    "below 1 kev the pattern of residuals for this model differs from model 1 such that the residual peak below 1 kev is slightly less pronounced than in figure [ fig.sim.n1399 ] .",
    "the pattern of residuals of model 3 ( figure [ fig.sim.hight ] ) is less complex than for the lower temperature models 1 and 2 .",
    "the best - fitting metallicity using the 1 t model ( @xmath5/fe fixed at solar ) is @xmath26 which represents only a 40% under - estimate of the true value in contrast to the @xmath27 under - estimate observed for models 1 and 2 .",
    "the fe bias decreases more dramatically as we move to still higher temperatures with model 4 ( figure [ fig.sim.hight ] ) . for this model",
    "we obtain a best - fitting value of @xmath28 using the 1 t model ( @xmath5/fe fixed at solar ) which is only a @xmath29 under - estimate of the true value .",
    "if we allow the @xmath5/fe ratios to vary ( table [ tab.1tvar ] ) the best - fitting fe abundance rises to @xmath30 ; i.e. the fe bias for hot clusters is insignificant .",
    "a physical explanation of the fe bias is as follows . for models 1 and 2 which have average temperatures @xmath10 kev",
    ", the colder temperature components preferentially excite emission lines in the fe l complex below 1 kev ( from ions fe 17 - 21 ) while the hotter temperature components preferentially excite the fe l lines from @xmath10 - 1.4 kev ( fe 21 - 24 ) . since these components contribute approximately equally to the emission measure",
    ", the net result is that the spectral shape in the highly temperature - sensitive fe l energy region is flattened with respect to a 1 t model .",
    "that is , the spectrum of a 1 t model which has the average temperature of the two components of models 1 or 2 ( and has the same fe abundance ) will preferentially excite the fe l lines right at 1 kev at the expense of the other fe l lines near @xmath31 kev and @xmath32 kev and thus will be more peaked at 1 kev than either model 1 or 2 . to partially compensate for this , i.e. to flatten the spectral shape near 1 kev , the 1 t model decreases its fe abundance so that the contribution of the flatter bremsstrahlung continuum is increased in the model .",
    "however , the distinctive residual pattern in figure [ fig.sim.n1399 ] demonstrates that the fe l lines are sufficiently temperature sensitive ( and the sis has sufficient energy resolution ) to thwart this attempt to successfully fit the 1 t model to the simulated two - temperature and cooling flow spectra .",
    "the strong temperature - sensitive fe l emission lines are the key to this fe bias . as one moves to higher temperatures ( models 3 and 4 ) the fe l lines become weaker and",
    "the bias decreases rapidly for average temperatures above 2 kev .",
    "moreover , at higher temperatures the strong 6.5 kev fe k emission line complex becomes increasingly more important and dominates the determination of the fe abundance .    a final note : since it is the variation of the spectral shape of the fe l complex with temperature which gives rise to the fe bias , one does not obtain a biased measurement of the fe abundance using a 1 t model if the spectrum consists of multiple spectral components which have the same temperature but different fe abundances . in this case",
    "the 1 t model yields a value for the fe abundance that is a weighted average over the various components .",
    "prominent residuals in the 1 t fits ( @xmath5/fe fixed at solar ) are located near the strong emission lines of o , ne , mg , si , and s ( figures [ fig.sim.n1399 ] and [ fig.sim.hight ] ) . if the abundances of these elements are allowed to vary separately from fe we obtain the results listed in table [ tab.1tvar ] .",
    "although in most instances the o , ne , and ( to a lesser extent ) the mg abundances differ significantly from fe , their new values do not correspond to a substantial reduction of the residuals over @xmath33 - 1.5 kev .",
    "the 1 t fits for models 1 and 2 produce zero o and ne abundances and mg / fe ratios less than solar .",
    "these results are very sensitive to the presence of excess absorption on the colder temperature component .",
    "if instead we consider a model identical to model 1 but with @xmath34 @xmath23 , then we obtain @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 .    for models 3 and 4",
    "the 1 t fits yield o , ne , and mg abundances very different from models 1 and 2 and from each other .",
    "although the 1 t fit for model 3 gives zero o abundance its large ne abundance is qualitatively different from models 1 and 2",
    ". the ratios of o / fe , ne / fe , and mg / fe obtained for model 4 are all very much in excess of solar .",
    "hence , the o , ne , and mg abundances are very sensitive to the temperature model and to the absorption model , and thus the systematic errors introduced when using a 1 t model to measure these abundances are more complex in origin than the fe bias discussed above .    in contrast , the k@xmath5 emission lines of si and s are at sufficiently high energies so that they are not affected by the absorption model .",
    "the residuals near the si ( @xmath39 - 2.0 kev ) and s ( @xmath40 - 2.7 kev ) lines are readily apparent for all the models in figures [ fig.sim.n1399 ] and [ fig.sim.hight ] , especially for model 4 .",
    "the 1 t fits with variable @xmath5/fe ratios listed in table [ tab.1tvar ] for models 1 - 3 indicate modest ratios of @xmath41 for @xmath42 and more substantial ratios of @xmath43 - 1.5 solar for @xmath44 .",
    "model 4 has the largest ratios with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the inferred values of si / fe tend to increase with temperature while the s / fe ratio is relatively constant .",
    "these excess si / fe and s / fe ratios inferred by 1 t models arise from two effects : ( 1 ) the colder temperature components present in the two - component models produce stronger si and s emission , and ( 2 ) the 1 t model under - estimates the continuum at energies above @xmath47 kev . issue # 1 is more important for the higher temperature systems like clusters ( model 4 ) while issue # 2 dominates for the lower temperature systems like elliptical galaxies ( models 1 - 2 ) .",
    "therefore , attempts to infer the si / fe and s / fe ratios using isothermal models on spectra that are intrinsically composed of multiple temperature components will necessarily yield values for these ratios that are biased in excess of the true values , the effect of which is most important for higher temperature clusters of galaxies .",
    "this bias may have played a role in the excess si / fe ratios obtained by mushotzky et al . and",
    "may in part explain the trend discovered by fukazawa et al .",
    "that the si / fe ratio rises with temperature for clusters galaxies . although fukazawa et al . attempt to eliminate any problems associated with multiphase gas by excluding the central regions of their clusters , it is quite possible that their arbitrary method of defining the affected regions does not fully remove the effects of multiphase gas and the resulting si bias we have described .",

    "<S> we analyze the _ asca _ spectra accumulated within @xmath0 kpc radii of 12 of the brightest groups of galaxies . upon fitting isothermal models ( 1 t ) jointly to the _ asca _ sis and gis spectra we obtain fits for most groups that are of poor or at best marginal quality and give very sub - solar metallicities similar to previous studies , @xmath1  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> two - temperature models ( 2 t ) provide significantly better fits for 11 out of the 12 groups and in every case have metallicities that are substantially larger than obtained for the 1 t models , @xmath3  @xmath2 . although not very well constrained , for most of the groups absorption in excess of the galactic value is indicated for the cooler temperature component of the 2 t models . </S>",
    "<S> a simple multiphase cooling flow model gives results analogous to the 2 t models including large metallicities , @xmath4  @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the nearly solar fe abundances and also solar @xmath5/fe ratios indicated by the 2 t and cooling flow models are consistent with models of the chemical enrichment of ellipticals , groups , and clusters which assume ratios of type ia to type ii supernova and an imf similar to those of the milky way .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have shown that the very sub - solar fe abundances and si / fe enhancements obtained from most previous studies within @xmath6 kpc of galaxy groups are an artifact of their fitting isothermal models to the x - ray spectra which also has been recently demonstrated for the brightest elliptical galaxies . owing to the importance of these results for interpreting x - ray spectra , in an appendix we use simulated _ asca _ observations to examine in detail the `` fe bias '' and `` si bias '' associated with the spectral fitting of ellipticals , groups , and clusters of galaxies .    </S>",
