    "the supernova rate is a key quantity for astrophysics .",
    "its knowledge is essential to constrain the mechanisms of galaxy formation and for understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "in particular , the chemical evolution of systems that at the present epoch have substantially reduced or totally exhausted star formation activity , such as elliptical galaxies , may dramatically depend on the rate of type ia events ( e.g. renzini et al .",
    "1993 , maoz & gal - yam 2004 ) .",
    "thus , any mechanism capable of producing a substantial enhancement of snia rate in this type of galaxies should be carefully investigated .",
    "moreover , studies of the connection between the frequency of occurrence of type ia sne and the properties of the environment where the sne - ia originate ( e.g. della valle & livio 1994 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ) can effectively constraint the still controversial nature of their progenitors ( e.g. hamuy et al .",
    "2003 , livio and riess 2003 ) .    in recent years",
    "three works have dealt with this topic , namely capetti ( 2002 ) , livio , riess and sparks ( 2002 ) and della valle and panagia ( 2003 ) .",
    "the former two papers claim the existence of a _ causality _ link between the position of 6 type ia sne ( capetti ) and a dozen of nova stars ( livio et al . ) with the jets of the respective parent radio - galaxies . in this scenario",
    "it is the jet itself that modifies the physical conditions of its environment by increasing the accretion rate from the interstellar medium onto the white dwarf progenitors , and thus it is the _ direct cause _ of a local enhancement of nova and type ia sn explosions .",
    "della valle & panagia , after analysing the evans , van den bergh & clure ( 1989 ) database ( hereafter evc89 ) , provided strong evidence for the existence of an enhancement by a factor 415 of the sn - ia rate in radio - loud galaxies with respect to radio - quiet ones .",
    "they argued that the mechanism which boosts the sn production is essentially independent of the position of the supernovae inside the parent galaxy , rather having the same common origin as the parent galaxies being strong radio sources , _ without causality _ link between the two phenomena .",
    "they suggested that repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with dwarf companions are responsible for inducing both strong radio activity in @xmath414% of early type galaxies and the @xmath5  gyr old stellar population needed to supply an adequate number snia progenitors .",
    "however , their results were based on a relatively small sample and deserve further investigation .    in this paper",
    "we analyse an approximately five times larger sample of sne occurred in early type galaxies , as reported by cappellaro , evans & turatto ( 1999 ) .",
    "this sample was obtained by merging the cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1993 , hereafter c93 ) sample with evc89 . in ",
    "2 we present the dataset , in ",
    "3 we first analyse the c93 sample , with the aim of providing an independent check of the results obtained by della valle & panagia ( 2003 ) ( based on evc89 ) , then we compute the sn rate in radio - loud and radio - quiet galaxies on the whole sample of sne provided by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in   4",
    "we discuss the results and their implications on the nature of snia progenitors .    tab .",
    "1 gives the comparison between the evc89 and cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) samples .",
    "data for the c93 sample can be obtained by subtracting the evc89 data from cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in the following",
    ", we will denote as _ radio - loud _ sources , all galaxies which have radio luminosities at 1.4ghz higher than @xmath6 erg  s@xmath7  hz@xmath7 ( e.g. sadler , jenkins , & kotanyi 1989 , ledlow & owen 1996 ) . the threshold value of @xmath8 erg @xmath9 hz@xmath7 is the faint limit of the luminosity function for the radio - galaxies ( see also urry & padovani 1995 ) , and , therefore , represents the ` natural ' threshold to identify `` radio - loud '' galaxies .",
    "we also define _ radio - faint _ the galaxies characterized by @xmath10 erg @xmath9 hz@xmath7 , i.e. galaxies whose radio emission is still not dominated by thermal processes ( phillips et al . 1986 ; and sadler et al .",
    "1989 ) and finally _ radio - quiet _ all galaxies with radio luminosities below @xmath11 erg s@xmath7 hz@xmath7 .",
    ".sn samples [ cols=\"<,>,^,^,>,^ , > \" , ]",
    "our results allow us to confidently conclude that the snia rate in radio - loud galaxies is a full factor of 4.4@xmath12 higher than it is measured in radio - quiet objects confirming , on more robust statistical grounds , the findings of della valle & panagia ( 2003 ) .",
    "we have also obtained some evidence ( p@xmath13 ) that the class of radio - faint galaxies may have a rate that is intermediate between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects .",
    "this enhancement in snia events in radio galaxies can be explained in basically two different ways :    \\1 ) the enhanced snia explosion rate in radio - loud galaxies is a _",
    "direct _ consequence of their being strong radio sources .",
    "this is the scenario suggested by capetti ( 2002 ) and livio et al .",
    "according to these authors the accretion rate from the interstellar medium onto white dwarfs could be enhanced by the action of the jets up to either driving an accreting white dwarf to approach the chandrasekhar mass and trigger a snia explosion ( livio 2000 , and references therein ) or increasing the accretion rate from the interstellar medium onto the white dwarfs by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude , up to @xmath14m@xmath15 yr@xmath7 , which is the rate necessary to trigger classical nova explosions ( prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) .",
    "this process might account for the high rate of novae observed in m87 in the regions nearby the jets .",
    "however , we note that equation ( 4 ) of livio et al ( 2002 ) , which is the transcription of bondi s ( 1952 ) formula for accretion on a star at rest , is valid only for very low stellar velocities ( @xmath16 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "this fact has important consequences on the practicability of this scenario . in a rather optimistic scenario",
    "in which @xmath17 and the jet has a width of @xmath4100  pc , the transit time is about 100  myrs during which the total accreted mass would be less than 0.1m@xmath15 , i.e. hardly enough to make a wd explode as snia , unless its mass was greater than @xmath18 . in a more realistic case ,",
    "in which one assumes typical star velocities of the order of 10 - 100 km  s@xmath7 ( see for example williams 1994 , who has measured the velocities of nova systems in the milky way ) the accreted mass onto massive wds would be only @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "this makes the accretion process from ism highly inefficient to trigger snia explosions ( while it may play a not negligible role to trigger nova explosions ) even in the presence of a high compression regime .",
    "in addition , we note that : + _ i ) _ even under the best conditions that could induce a snia explosion ( @xmath22  km  s@xmath7 ; m@xmath23 m@xmath15 ) , the resulting snia is expected to be spatially confined to the regions immediately adjacent to radio jets and/or the bulk of radio activity . while this may be true for ngc 4374 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , it appears not to be the case for fornax  a = ngc  1316 ( fig .",
    "3 ) in which the two snia ( sn 1980n and sn 1981d ) are located quite far from the strong radio lobes ( geldzahler & fomalont 1984 ) , nor for centaurus  a = ngc  5128 , in which sn  1986 g is deeply embedded in the equatorial lane of gas and dust ( fig .",
    "+ _ ii ) _ if the dominant phenomenon is accretion from the ism rather than from a binary companion , an extreme consequence is that all _ single _ wds could contribute to the nova and snia production , and not only some binary systems with suitable parameters .",
    "actually , since the fraction of stars that may give rise to a snia is only @xmath24 of the total number of stars with masses above 3 m@xmath15  ( madau , della valle & panagia  1998 , dahlen et al .",
    "2004 ) , in order to explain the observed enhancement in the sn rate ( a factor @xmath25 ) one can work out that jets should be capable of raising the efficiency of the sn explosions up to @xmath26 not only in the regions near the jets , but also over a significant fraction of the entire galaxy , according to the simple relation : @xmath27 where @xmath28 parameter is the efficiency of sn explosions and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the volumes sampled by the jet and the whole galaxy .",
    "+ _ iii ) _ for a density of 100  @xmath31 and a jet width of 100  pc as advocated by livio et al . ( 2002 ) , the column density of hi associated with a jet would be about @xmath32  @xmath33 . in this case",
    "one should expect an intense 21 cm line emission , which has never been observed in association with jets .",
    "+ _ iv ) _ a clear indication that accretion of interstellar matter by slow ( v@xmath34 ) wds is not an efficient process to trigger snia explosions , is that snia occurring in spiral galaxies are not associated with molecular clouds , which are regions with the  ideal \" conditions , i.e. high particle density and very low temperatures , for triggering a snia explosion through this mechanism .",
    "it appears that the accretion from ism can work only in the presence of very special circumstances , which makes a snia explosion through accretion",
    "  la bondi \" an exception rather than the rule .",
    "+ in summary , since there is no evidence that direct accretion from the ism could be capable to boost the snia rate in radiogalaxies by a factor of 4 , we conclude that the dominant process is very likely a different one .",
    "\\2 ) as an alternative we propose that the enhancement of snia explosion rate in radio - loud galaxies has the _ same common _ origin as their being strong radio sources ( see also kochhar 1989 ; kochhar & prabhu 1984 ) , but that there is no _ causality _ link between the two phenomena .",
    "if the radio activity of a galaxy is triggered by interaction and/or mergers ( e.g. baade & minkowski 1954 , balick & heckman 1982 , heckman _",
    "et al . _",
    "1986 ) , then the snia rate can be enhanced by the formation or the capture of relatively young stellar populations in which snia occur at much higher rates than in genuinely old populations ( della valle & livio 1994 , panagia 2000 , mannucci et al .",
    "snia progenitors are believed to be stars with original masses @xmath353  m@xmath15   and @xmath368  m@xmath15(greggio & renzini 1983 ) having nuclear - burning lifetimes shorter than @xmath4400  myrs .",
    "after that time , the star becomes a white dwarf and may explode as a snia only after an additional time as needed for either accreting mass from a companion or merging with it . such a time ( @xmath37 ) is essentially unconstrained by theory , but measurements of snia rates in the local universe ( mannucci et al .",
    "2005 ) have shown that : ( a ) the rate of type ia sne in blue galaxies is about a factor 30 higher than it has been measured in red galaxies ; ( b ) the rate of type ia sne can be reproduced by combining a constant contribution ( corresponding to the rate of ia in radio - quiet galaxies ) + another contribution which exhibits a behaviour similar to that of core - collapse sne ( see their fig .",
    "this implies evolutionary times ( main sequence life - time + @xmath37 @xmath38 gyrs ) much shorter than the time scale needed by young ` blue ' galaxies to become ` red ' galaxies ( @xmath39 gyrs to change ( b - k ) by about 1 mag , see for example bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "this result may not be at variance with the recent findings of gal - yam & maoz ( 2004 ) and strogler et al.(2004 ) , who derived @xmath40 gyrs from counts of snei - a at high z. this may rather suggest that @xmath37 spans a broad range of values , possibly from @xmath38 up to a few gyrs ( mannucci , della valle & panagia , in preparation , greggio 2005 ) . as a consequence , in order to sustain a relatively high rate of snia explosions ( characterized by a short @xmath37 ) during the time in which a galaxy is radio - loud ( @xmath41 yr , e.g. srianand & gopal - krishna 1998 ) , a galaxy has to have a new injection of young stellar populations at suitable time intervals . since the fraction of radio - loud ellipticals is about 14% of the total number of ellipticals ( ledlow & owen 1996 ) , we can estimate that , on average , an elliptical galaxy undergoes a number of star formation episodes , @xmath42 , of the order of @xmath43 , for a hubble  time @xmath44  gyrs .",
    "therefore , the time interval between successive episodes of injection of young stellar populations , @xmath45 , turns out to be @xmath46 0.7  gyr . in late type galaxies",
    ", the ongoing star formation provides the needed input for a steady production of snia events .",
    "such a supply in early type galaxies can naturally be provided by repeated episodes of interaction or mergers that induces either formation of young stellar populations ( galaxy interaction ; _",
    "e.g. _  the antennae galaxies , whitmore _",
    "et al . _",
    "1999 ) or capture of young stars from dwarf companions .",
    "well known examples of interacting and/or merging early type galaxies are centaurus  a = ngc  5128 and fornax  a = ngc  1316 , which are strong radio sources and indeed have produced 1 + 2 snia in the last century .",
    "strong support to this hypothesis comes from the following two facts :    \\i ) in tab .",
    "4 we have reported the sn rate for ellipticals radio- loud , faint , quiet , and spirals normalized per unit of mass . a simple glance at col . 2 and fig .",
    "5 shows that the rates of snia are higher in late type galaxies than in early type galaxies by a full order of magnitude , then suggesting a connection between the production of type ia sne and star formation activity ( e.g. mannucci et al . 2005 ) .",
    "5 shows the behaviour of the normalized snia rate ( per 10@xmath47 ) as a function of the morphological hubble type and radio activity .",
    "the data clearly shows that for the snia production , radio - loud early type galaxies behave like ` s0a / b ' which are systems where the star forming activity is certantly dimmed with respect to sd / irr , but still active , likely of the order of @xmath48 yr@xmath7 per @xmath49 ( e.g. tinsley 1974 , sandage 1986 , kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "it is then plausible that this enhancement of snia rate originates from episodes of star formation , which may have been triggered , on time - scale of 1 gyr , by merging dwarf galaxies .",
    "this scenario provides a natural explanation of why among early type galaxies snia rates are higher in radiogalaxies without requiring the concurrence of any new and/or additional process to enhance the snia rates .",
    "\\ii ) the existence of systematic differences between type ia sne occuring in spirals and ellipticals , which has been accumulating in the last decade both spectroscopically ( branch & van den bergh 1993 , li et al .",
    "2001 ) and photometrically ( van den bergh & pazder 1992 , della valle & panagia 1992 , hamuy et al .",
    "1995 , hamuy et al .",
    "2000 ) , can be effectively represented by the distribution of the decline rate parameter @xmath50 ( phillips 1993 ; phillips et al . 1999 ) . in fig .",
    "6 we report the distribution of the rates of decline for late ( shade - dotted histogram ) and early type galaxies .",
    "data were taken from branch , romanishin and baron ( 1996 ) and parodi et al .",
    "the probability that the two distributions originate from the same population , is excluded by ks - test at the level of p=@xmath51 ( see also altavilla et al .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation of the double - peaked distribution of the rates of decline is obtained in terms of an age sequence , ( e.g. branch & van den bergh 1993 ; ruiz - lapuente 1995 ; hamuy et al.1996 ; howell 2001 ; but see the case of sn 2002bo , benetti et al .",
    "2003 ) , with metallicity being excluded or at least less important ( ivanov , hamuy and pinto 2000 ) . with the dashed - solid box",
    "we have indicated the rates of decline for the 8 objects belonging to our sample of sne in radio - galaxies for which it was possible to derive the rates of decline .",
    "we find tantalizing evidence ( p@xmath52 ) that the rates of decline for the objects occurred in radio - galaxies are ` intermediate ' between those of the late and early type galaxies .",
    "this fact supports the existence of a _ continuum _ of properties between galaxies with very active ( irr and late spirals ) , active ( early spirals and radio - active ellipticals ) and exhausted ( ellipticals radio - quiet ) star formation rate and type ia supernovae . in spirals with high star forming activity snia are generally overluminous , believed to be produced in younger systems from the most massive snia progenitors ( _ e.g. _  tutukov & yungelson 1994 , 1996 , ruiz - lapuente , burkert & canal 1995 ) , sneia in radio - loud ellipticals are characterized by faster rates of decline ( _ i.e. _  less luminous sne ) and they might originate from progenitor of intermediate mass . finally radio - quiet ellipticals mainly produce faint type ia events from a genuine ` old ' pop ii stellar population ( light progenitors ) .",
    "an important consequence of our scenario is the predicted occurrence of a few type ii - ib / c sne in early type galaxies at the early stages of the same star formation burst that provides a steady supply of snia progenitors .",
    "since core collapse sne are produced by progenitors more massive than 8m@xmath15 , whose lifetime is shorter than about 30 myrs , only for a small fraction of the time between subsequent interaction / capture episodes ( approximately 30myrs/1gyr=3% ) would one expect to see such sne in early type galaxies .",
    "since in galaxies with active star formation the rate of type ii and ib / c sne is about 2 and 2/3 times than that of snia , respectively , we estimate that one should detect core - collapse ( _ cc _ ) events at a rate 3%@xmath53 8% of snia events , which corresponds to an average rate of _ cc _ sne of about 0.0152@xmath54snu .",
    "given the control time measured by cappellaro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for type _ ii plateau , ii linear _ and _ ib / c _ : 4021 yr , 3213 yr and 5011 yr @xmath55 , and the relative frequencies of occurence of each _ cc _ sn into the _ plateau _ , _ linear _ and",
    "_ ib / c _ sub - types ( 0.6 , 0.2 and 0.2 respectively ) , in our sample one should have detected @xmath56 ( 4057)/100=0.62 sne , where we have used the weighted mean of the control times reported above . applying poisson statistics , we estimate that the probability of finding no _ cc _ sn event in our sample is @xmath57 , so that the absence of _ cc _ sne is just a rather natural occurrence . we conclude that our prediction will be observationally testable when the snia statistics will have increased the control time by a factor @xmath58 ( @xmath59 confidence level ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that the type ia supernova rate for radio - loud galaxies is more than a factor of four higher than for radio - quiet ones .",
    "this is true even when the rate is normalized to stellar mass instead of b - band luminosity , a more physical approach .",
    "combined with the well - established connection between type ia sne and star - formation rate , this suggests a link between the radio - loud phenomenon and increased star - formation , which might prove to be an important piece of the still unexplained puzzle of radio - loudness in the universe .",
    "mdv is grateful to the space telescope science institute for the friendly hospitality and creative atmosphere .",

    "<S> an analysis of snia events in early type galaxies from the cappellaro _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  ( 1999 ) database provides conclusive evidence that the rate of type ia supernovae ( sne ) in radio - loud galaxies is about 4 times higher than the rate measured in radio - quiet galaxies , _ i.e. _   snia - rate@xmath0 snu as compared to snia - rate@xmath1 snu . </S>",
    "<S> the actual value of the enhancement is likely to be in the range @xmath2 ( p@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding puts on robust empirical grounds the results obtained by della valle & panagia ( 2003 ) on the basis of a smaller sample of sne .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the possible causes of this result and conclude that the enhancement of snia explosion rate in radio - loud galaxies has the same origin as their being strong radio sources , but there is no causality link between the two phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that repeated episodes of interaction and/or mergers of early type galaxies with dwarf companions , on times - scale of about 1  gyr , are responsible for inducing both strong radio activity observed in @xmath414% of early type galaxies and to supply an adequate number of snia progenitors to the stellar population of ellipticals . </S>"
